B000LAZDJW|5.0|Older, but not unlike a find wine, Jackie Chan keeps getting better and better with age.  Out of his usual  role, Jackie plays a \\"not so good guy\\" in this film.  By the end, he shows us the soft-hearted \\"hero\\" we're used to.  This is a different kind of character for Jackie but he proves, once again, that he's an ACTOR - not \\"just a stuntman\\".  Oh, and if you think the singer of the title song sound's likes Jackie's voice - you're right!

0547258305|5.0|What a wonderful story of romance, intrigue, fantasy abilities to use combat skills to the max, and with all this, it is heartbreaking! What a great tale and all the elements are there to keep you riveted to your seat. You will not want to put this book down. I won't go on about the characters as this is for the reader to discover. You will not be disappointed if you enjoy sci-fi fantasy!
B003954I9C|5.0|AJ has one of the most unique voices in music and I LOVE this album! I didn't know what to expect, but it has a good mix of up-tempo tracks and ballads. \\"London\\" and \\"Gorgeous\\" are my favorites, but \\"What If\\" and \\"I Quit\\" are also great songs. If you like his voice as much as I do, you won't be disappointed!
0446691437|5.0|Pressfield's book is practical guide that is both supportive and realistic.  He explains in simple terms a most basic lesson that most creativity guides talk around for pages:  Productivity is hard work.  The book appeals to the pragmatist as much as the dreamer, encouraging resolve, wisdom, and drive to achieve tangible representations of creativity.<br />I keep it on my desk for daily words of encouragement.<br /><br />Personally, I appreciate his ability to speak to all readers- his eye is trained on equity of gender and spirituality.  As an atheist woman, it's refreshing to feel spoken to in equal measure as other readers, particularly when dealing with ineffable issues of creativity and spirit.<br /><br />If you are an artist of any kind, this book is essential.
B001E3AXGS|5.0|In the age of extreme partisanship, the inspiring example of leadership by those often in disagreement with each other demonstrates the strength in collaborative government. Lincoln's political courage in choosing to surround himself with smart people regardless of party affiliation gave great strength to a president who had to lead the country through one of it's darkest chapters. It's a great read, and aught to be on history class reading lists everywhere.

I would recommend the book to anyone who is dealing with a difficult transition.

B0039TD7RC|5.0|Over the years I've heard so much about how \\"classic\\" this album was I continually avoided it. I didn't honestly think it was well received for the right reasons. When I first heard it a part of me wound up agreeing. It had nothing to do with the quality of the music but I found the mix \\"whack\\": best word I can think of to describe it. Now it was often said this album was famous for it's garagy muddy sound,even by Rolling Stones standards but the mix was almost unlistenable to me. Well when I heard about this remaster with bonus tracks again my caution lights came on. Would this just be the Stones bid into the \\"loudness wars\\" so many other CD remasters have dealt with? The answer is no. You can't have an album like this remastered in that way because it defeats the entire purpose in terms of the rawness of sound. What they did do is correct the problems I personally had with the original CD and that was Mick's vocal tracks (a primary issue) and the general crispness. It's a great remastering job and really gives you a chance to get into the music. Well there's no denying it:this has a lot of great songs on it. It has a lot of songs PERIOD. To be perfectly honest,some songs stand out above others but in general the album really does hold together as sort of a piece. That's a pretty odd thing for a straight out rock n roll album. Now this music actually isn't any departure at all from what the Stones did on [[ASIN:B001WCN23W Sticky Fingers]]. It covers the same basic mix of rock,blues and country with Bobby Keys on sax and Nicky Hopkins on bass. There are also classic Stones' rockers such as \\"Rocks Off\\",the 50's styled \\"Rip This Joint\\" along with the hit \\"Tumbling Dice\\",\\"Soul Survivor\\" and \\"I Just Want To See A Face\\". There's also some great proto-funk blues here  such as \\"Casino Boogie\\",\\"Shake Your Hips\\" (something of a Slim Harpo takeoff so I hear) and one nice country inflected song \\"Sweet Virginia\\". I always rather liked the Stones' bluesy take on country-western and it's in keeping with their style. A couple songs such as \\"Turd On The Run\\" and \\"I Just Want To See His Face\\" feature some great gospel-soul organs,rhythm boxes and unusual processed psychedelic funk styled vocals. The second CD that comes with this is one of those bonus CD's many of these reissues should be so lucky (and should) have. \\"Pass The Wine (Sophia Loren)\\" is a great send up done in a great rock n soul style. There are also several excellent rockers in \\"Plundered My Soul\\",\\"Following The River\\" and \\"Dancing In The Light\\" that are so strong you realize just how much the band recorded for this album that wasn't album to go onto it. There are also some somewhat rougher alternate takes of songs like \\"Loving Cup\\" and \\"Soul Survivor\\" as well for comparasin to the finished versions which were rough to begin with. Taking a look at this set there seems like there's a lot of music to deal with here and there is. But it is the culmination of what had been going on so far in the Mick Taylor era and really the last of this particular kind of album the Stones' would make. Even here and especially on albums to come they'd begin expanding their sound into different,more contemporary areas. But up until today they never really have abandoned the core sound that this album actually represents.bluesy take on country-western and it's in keeping with their style.

B00000099Y|5.0|Metal (or meTal as the Amazon forum likes to call it). Rock and roll pushed to the excessive extremes of volume, technicality, masculinity, and darkness. Worshipped by fans, too often dismissed by critics, and attacked by polititions of both major American parties. It makes a great soundtrack to our frustration and pusuit of power in our lives. Great stuff, but with a great flaw: heavy handedness. Good thing we have Tool.      Tool has the unique ability to make refreshingly un-pretentious, soulful heavy metal that clearly comes from the bottom of a very dark heart.      Combining the epic majesty of Pink Floyd and the heaviness of prime time Black Sabbath, Tool's \\"AEnima\\" is possibly the most strangely beautiful metal album I know of. Adam Jones's guitar can scream like a monster and sing like an angel, dripping with distortion and echo. Justin Chancellor plays both stomping basselines at the lowest part of the instrument's down-tuned range and clean, lyrical lead melodies nearer to the top. Danney Carey brings on pounding prog beats rich with intricate fills and tricky time signatures. The famous Maynard James Keenan's one-of-a-kind vox completes the formula, sorrowfully serenading one moment and bellowing with rage in the next. I think the contrasting of elements is a good stragey to making memorable music. \\"AEnima\\"'s juxtaposition of brutality against sweetness is an exhibit of that strategy executed perfectly.    Some key tracks:    \\"Pushit\\" - A lengthy progtastic mini-drama. One of the \\"AEnima\\"'s more ethereal songs.    \\"AEnima\\" - A prayer for the Apocalypse. Probably the best (and angriest) song on the album.    \\"Hooker with a Penis\\" - A big FU (literally) to moronic fans who accuse bands of selling out. Makes a great headbanger.    \\"Message to Harry Manback\\" - A drunk Italian guy leaving a threatening message on an answering machine with some melancholy piano music playing the background. One of several short segues between songs.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This album is about Africa/AEthiopia/Abyssinia and repatriation thereof.  From all things rooted to its diaspora throughout the globe we recognize Jamaica's voice by way of roots, dancehall, toasting expressed by Damian.  Then we have the art built upon that expression which is rap, it's own culture of Hip Hop born out of toasting, expressed by Nas.  This surface understanding is profound in and of itself; Kingston to Queensbridge.  We then take the rabbit hole further and recognize each movement and the reasons why these cultures rose;  from the depths of poverty stricken, enslavement, and desensitizing conditions we look back to Africa/AEthiopia/Abyssinia as the true home of any people of westernized colonies, thus sampling from Malian and Ethiopian artists is appropriate.  This album is a grand example of distant relatives.  Here is where we have both Rastafari and Islamic views and supposed ties with masonry intertwined with a profound understanding that distant relatives applies both to our physical blood ties and spiritual orders.  Rastafari, via Damian, follows the true ancient order of the Masons (Solomonic and Cush) and the \\"copy-cats\\" Scottish rights masonry/free masonry, Nas (supposedly?), (though obscure in intent) is actually the western world's borrowed and often-times corrupt version of that same ancient understanding.  Logically, you can only gather that there is only One Source of understanding(or overstanding) and man (or hu-man) has effectively borrowed and manipulated from the same Source.  It is only a matter of time until we return back to our truest nature under Jah.  This album is profound as it is divine in its composition, nuances, and subtleties.  Kings(ton) and Queens(bridge), Selassie and Menen , Alpha and Omega.  Full circle my friends,  this is not only just an music album but a sign of the times.

0981951244|5.0|This book by Darren Hardy, publisher of Success magazine, shows you how seemingly insignificant changes can create huge differences in outcomes. That's what makes the strategies in his book so doable. You don't have to set an unreachable goal to be successful. Instead, you just need to keep doing the little things - even when the immediate results aren't apparent.<br /><br />As Darren so clearly demonstrates, it's your habits and choices that make the difference. And, he shows you how understanding your \\"why-power\\" enables you to make the daily changes that yield massive results. Personally, I enjoyed learning about his own success habits too. Very impressive. I have a lot to learn from him!<br /><br />To sum it all up: The little things you do add up to success - so do them. This easy-to-read book is motivational, filled with lots of \\"how to\\" advice and definitely worthwhile.

B001OQCV2E|3.0|For a movie that's entitled \\"2012,\\" you would expect some info on the Mayan prophecies or something. But since this is a film by Roland Emmerich, we get very little of it. Instead, we have a bloated action adventure with spectacular special effects.....and that's about it. Now, I don't have anything against Emmerich (I happen to like \\"Independence Day\\"), it's just that his movies look like they're just an excuse to put in some lovely special effects (except \\"The Patriot,\\" obviously). There isn't much story or character development; they're pretty bad, but they're not really terrible. The lack of story and character is also evident here in \\"2012.\\" I can't exactly care about the characters in this movie; the only people I like are the Harry (Blu Mankuma) & the Russian pilot (Johann Urb). They're only supporting characters, and that's a bad sign considering none of the main characters are interesting enough for me to like them. And yes, the scientific accuracy in this movie is highly questionable. There are so many impossible scenarios and so many predictable turning points that you realize that the movie's specialty is only special effects and suspense. But I guess \\"2012\\" succeeds in what it's trying to be: a mindless, overwrought, unrealistic two-and-a-half hour disaster film with some pretty nice CGI effects and some pretty intense moments. This is basically a standard popcorn movie: if you're looking for a solid plot, deep character development, witty dialogue, and originality, then you better look somewhere else. I could care less about \\"2012\\" but at least it looked good.<br /><br />Grade: C-

B002L5GQGY|2.0|First things first, all right? THIS GUY CAN PLAY. THIS GUY CAN REALLY, REALLY PLAY THE GUITAR, PLAY BLUES, EVEN SING WELL. And this video shows that! Eric Clapton shows up on stage in this video, even indicates to the British crowd that he is impressed with Bonamassa's playing style. And Clapton's home crowd gives Bonamassa a standing ovation when Bonamassa is done! Impressive, no? You bet it is. I saw Bonamassa live once, he opened for Buddy Guy a few years ago. He played very well, sang very well.    But...no. This video shows Joe Bonamassa the same way I did when I saw him live. He plays the notes, he has the talent. You bet. But he does not have the genius. Watching this video I was thinking precisely that. He is like a baseball pitcher who can throw fast, or throw a particular type of pitch well, but cannot take command of a game, save it, WIN IT. He's a student who has studied well, not a master.    THIS GUY IS NOT STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN, IS NOT HIS EQUIVALENT. I am not talking about playing STYLE, I'm talking about the passion, the genius. Stevie Ray Vaughan had that, like Clapton, like Hendrix. Bonamassa could never have stood beside Stevie Ray Vaughan and been taken seriously. People would have seen him as the minor leaguer he is. Don't waste your money.    He must have a good agent, though, huh? And that's all it takes, right?

If you ever thought you had it rough, this book will fix your attitude. There's a certain type of discussion, often called the \\"come to jesus\\" discussion regardless of whether it had anything to do with religion - it's the last-chance talk you have with someone who needs a major attitude adjustment. This book is a factual account of a hidden world, a condemnation of a nation mired in disaster, and a rousing face-slap for anyone in the west so stuck on their own problems they can't see any way out.<br /><br />It's also giving you a glimpse into a world so secretive that most people know more about the fantasy world of \\"Avatar\\" than they do about this real place. It's showing you scenes of terrifying beauty couched in scenes of humanitarian desecration. It's a glimpse into another world, one you will never get the chance to see, one that bears no resemblance to anything else on this earth. It's a fossil, something preserved from the days of kings and emperors, and gives you a glimpse into how the world was run before the Magna Carta forced western monarchies to recognize their duty, no matter how limited, to their people. It ought to be required reading for romanticists and those who dream of royalty: this is how it works int he real world, when one man has absolute power.

B001OQCV6A|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  Here is the newfangled Sherlock Holmes, courtesy action director Guy Ritchie. Ritchie initially wanted to cast a younger actor for the part of Sherlock Holmes but settled on Robert Downey Jr., after envisioning the new Holmes as a Bohemian artist type. This fit right in with Downey's belief that Holmes is supposed to be \\"quirky and kind of nuts\\", an interpretation which was suggested to him by his real life wife, Susan Downey. What appealed to Downey about this interpretation of Holmes is \\"quirky and kind of nuts\\" is the way he views himself!<br /><br />  Now I have no problem with Holmes being depicted as eccentric (which is precisely the way Sir Arthur Conan Doyle conceived him) but there was also a certain meticulousness and dignity which Downey runs away from in his interpretation. Start with Downey's unshaved look throughout the picture--would the meticulous Holmes allow himself to look so scruffy while everyone else in proper Victorian society is so well manicured? Despite his amazing powers of deductive reasoning and ability to solve cases, Victorian society would never accept a Holmes that refuses to conform to its basic norms. I'm also thinking of the ludicrous opening scene at the Baker Street apartment where Holmes is shooting bullets into the wall in an attempt to develop some kind of early 'silencer'. Can you imagine Basil Rathbone, from the original Sherlock Holmes movies, shooting at the walls and terrorizing his landlady and the other lodgers in the building?<br /><br />  And isn't it beneath Holmes to be so petty in his relationship to his perennial sidekick, Watson? The scene at the restaurant where he brings Watson's fianc&eacute; to tears and causes her to walk out, just seems so out of character for Holmes. Yes, he's supposed to be cold and insensitive at times, but that happens when he becomes absorbed in attempting to solve his cases. It should not apply to a social gathering where he boorishly undermines the relationship between a close colleague and his fianc&eacute;.<br /><br />  The childish interplay between Holmes and Watson goes on for a good two thirds of the movie. I fail to see the humor in such scenes as inside the carriage when Holmes teases Watson by keeping the money he won gambling the night before (Watson of course is an inveterate gambler) and Watson then (tit for tat) throws Holmes' vest outside the carriage window. Both Robert Downey and Jude Law both seem to offer up the same over the top interpretations for Holmes and Watson and I found I couldn't distinguish very well between the two characters. I much prefer the buffoonish Nigel Bruce as Watson opposite Basil Rathbone in those old movies since at least the contrast between the two was evident.<br /><br />  Ritchie's plot runs into a great deal of trouble for the first two thirds of the movie due to slow pacing. There's an attempt to pick things up with a couple of action scenes which grow tiresome. I had no trouble with the early scene of Downey as action hero in the boxing ring which Ritchie claims is derived from the original Sherlock Holmes stories; but then there's a long drawn out sequence where Holmes and Watson battle an evil giant and then end up destroying a ship while in dry dock. Then there's the scene with Irene Adler interacting with a hidden Professor Moriarty; we end up seeing the scene twice since Holmes ends up explaining what he deduces from his confrontation with the evil Professor to Watson.<br /><br />  Nor is the rest of the story very exciting leading to the climax. Reordan, the man Adler has been looking for, turns up dead in Lord Blackwell's coffin, despite Blackwell being hanged earlier for the murder of five women. Then Blackwell murders his father who heads the Temple of the Four Orders.<br /><br />  Finally things begin to pick up when Holmes confronts Home Secretary Lord Coward. In one of the best scenes in the movie, Holmes tricks Coward into revealing that Blackwood and company intend to wipe out all members of the House of Lords. Holmes is initially brought to Coward in handcuffs but it's later revealed that Inspector Lestrade has given Holmes the keys to escape. Lestrade, by the way, reminds me of the excellent late actor, Donald Pleasance, and ably acquits himself in the thankless role of second fiddle to Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />  For those sticklers who find all of the evil Blackwell's machinations to be completely implausible (such as how he manages evade detection in staging his own death by hanging), I cannot disagree; however, the film is not supposed to be taken too literally or seriously. Ritchie finally gets things moving at the climax and I liked how Holmes dispatches Blackwell on the under construction Tower Bridge. I'm not so sure however, how Irene Adler survives that fall after Blackwell pushes her off the bridge.<br /><br />  For purists such as myself, the scenes where Holmes uses his deductive reasoning (such as his ability to follow a carriage's path while blindfolded) are quite welcome. Nonetheless, with Robert Downey choosing to play Holmes for a good part of the time as a lout who resembles a drunkard and a completely nondescript Watson who serves up no significant contrasts to his wily colleague, the new Sherlock Holmes lacks the main ingredient that has been found to be offered up by some of its predecessors: charm!members of the House of Lords.

B001TH16DS|5.0|I was hesitant to pull the trigger on this set for a while, but now that I have it in hand I'm really pleased. There are so many classic episodes here, and I think that anyone who grew up with these like I have will be blown away by the clarity of the HD quality. The restoration job is hands down the best I've seen for a tv show that's this old. As for the new CGI stuff, I was hesitant that they'd diminish the nostalgia...but I've grown to look forward to them, especially after switching back and forth between the original sfx shots. Compact, no nonsense packaging is another nice feature. Perhaps my favorite surprise was the newly recorded orchestral score that's faithful to the original while adding new depth to music that's become so iconic in my memory...and it's real treat in surround sound. My household is having such a blast viewing these that we've already got season two in the mail.
0061537969|5.0|I know, I know. Most of us think our dogs are smart. Ginger, for example, knows about 20 tricks, one of which is where she puts away her toys in her toy box. She IS smart. But, she is no Enzo. Enzo uses metaphors to connect car racing to life lessons, he watches law shows and could practically run a courtroom, and he hopes to be reincarnated as a man, because he saw it on the National Geographic channel.<br /><br />I have never read a book where you see through the eyes of a dog. Enzo desperately loves his master Denny, Denny's wife, Eve (although he may not be as connected to her as the others) and their daughter Zoe. When tragedy strikes in the family, and Zoe is taken away while Denny has to fight a court battle to try and get her back, Enzo can't do anything, but be there for them, like all dogs are. But, he suffers because he sees their hurt, he can't hug them, and of course, he has no thumbs. What's a dog to do? The ending was expected, but so beautiful and heartfelt. I sat quietly for about five minutes, just contemplating it and crying.<br /><br />Ok, so it was a little bit slow at first. But, about 50 pages in, the story grabbed me and wouldn't let me go until the end. So, I finished it in a couple of days. I recommend it, not only to dog lovers, but those who aren't, because we all need a reminder that sometimes animals have more love and compassion than people do.

In some ways, for someone who values and depends on his public image so much, this book provides a very intimate view of Richard Branson's childhood, and his early business successes and failures - and there is plenty of both! In fact, it is the determination and willingness to take larger and larger risks that makes this book such an interesting read. If you're running a small business, with a tight budget, and are dreaming about the \\"good days\\", think again.. whether you're running an airline, or a local record shop, this book is the epitome of what it means to lead a life of an entrepreneur: you are always in pursuit of something bigger, and are always operating on the edge of your physical, mental, and fiscal limits. A classic, highly recommend it!

B003HE2B6C|3.0|As a fan since 1997, I can say this album is too Hanson for it's own good. It's all a bit repetitive and overall unimpressive. There appears to be no push to create something different from anything else they've ever written. I understand they have a signature sound, but that doesn't mean so many of the songs have to sound so similar. Several of the songs are just flat and mediocre. The songs I actually like are still mediocre in my opinion- I am just a little biased in the way that I enjoy them.    The songs I loved (which turns out are the only two ballads on the album):    Use Me Up (Track 8)- Zac is definitely a balladeer at heart. Even though this song pales in comparison to previously heard versions, it is still a beautifully written and sung song despite there being a bit of what seems a lack of emotion.    Me Myself and I (Track 12)- Where \\"Use Me Up\\" lacked emotion, Taylor really lays it on thick, and the end result is another simple, gorgeous and thankfully not overpowering ballad about a break-up. It screams Hanson, but in this instance that's just fine. They kill at ballads.    Songs I could (almost) listen to until the end:    Kiss Me When You Come Home (Track 3)- While I actually was unimpressed the first time I heard this several weeks ago (when it was released for listen on the internet), it grew on me. I'm a sucker for songs that start with a drum solo, so the fact that this one does is a plus. I'm also a fan of the first verse, and the chorus is one of the catchiest on the album despite the extreme levels of cheesiness.    Carry You There (Track 4)- The things that keep me listening are the chorus (which the song starts right off with), and towards the end, their harmonies are lovely on the repetitive \\"I'll carry you there, I will carry you there\\".     And I Waited (Track 7)- This song starts off with a killer drum solo, so in that respect I, again, may be biased. I am also a huge fan of Zac's voice, so that adds to the appeal of this song. However, this is another song that pales in comparison to a previously heard version (which happened to be live), so that initial love still resides and carried over to this studio version.    Voice in the Chorus (Track 11)- This could be here simply because I really enjoyed Taylor's singing which did little to impress me on most of the songs. But overall the song is pretty catchy and pleasant. I can't help but think, though, that if this were on, say, \\"Underneath\\" (which is the album this song is most comparable to), it would have been one of my least favorite songs.    Songs that impress me very little or not at all:    Waiting For This (Track 1)- While it starts off promising with a fun bit of piano and then the entrance of a cool guitar riff it quickly goes downhill. Taylor doesn't sound his best, and the harmonies on the chorus are off. The lyrics are what can only be described as \\"generic Hanson.\\" Unimpressive.    Thinkin' 'Bout Somethin' (Track 2)- When I first heard it back when they released it on the internet, I was able to dance to it, but it got old quickly. I initially enjoyed the cowbell at the beginning, but anytime I hear that cowbell now, I groan. Also, Taylor's voice sounds kind of awful. This song is so annoying to me at this point that MMMBop would be a relief.    Give A Little (Track 5)- This song is just five kinds of cheesy, and nothing about it is appealing. It's extremely cringe-inducing, and I would like to tell Taylor he doesn't have to force his voice so much because we all know he's got a beautiful voice.    Make It Out Alive (Track 6)- The instrumentation at the beginning is really great, and the chorus is pretty catchy. However, the verses are unremarkable, and it takes so long to get to the chorus I get bored and have to switch songs.    These Walls (Track 9)- Absolutely nothing remarkable about this song. The beginning doesn't grab my attention, Taylor's voice is emotionless and once again, the verses are so boring that I forget that the chorus is kind of nice, so I find myself skipping to another song.    Musical Ride (Track 10)- One of Zac's least impressive performances. In fact I'd say his voice is annoying which is something I rarely think. The harmonies are practically non-existent. It sounds like each boy was recorded separately and then those recordings were layered together with no care as to if it sounded good. The singing doesn't seem to fit with the instrumentation well either.

B003CIG7AE|4.0|A few years back while working for a major film company I was in the Music department of our west coast office as I often was.  Upon returning from lunch one day I was greeted by a truly different and amazing sound.  The Music department often played new acts and many times cutting edge.  What I was hearing was something I couldn't quite classify and yet I found myself intoxicated by the sound.  The song was \\"The First Song\\" and of course the group was Band of Horses.  I bought Everything All The Time that day and it has maintained it's status as one of the best pieces of work I have ever heard.    Clearly, music is quite possibly the pinnacle of subjectivism.  It's emotional and personal and so there are no absolutes.  That being said, if you love music as much as I do you probably hold certain pieces of music as magical.  Of course that doesn't mean that your favorite artists will reproduce that magic each and every time.  Babe Ruth didn't hit one out of the park at each bat and the same holds true for the artists that are near and dear to our hearts.  Whether it's historic pieces such as Sgt. Pepper's or Physical Graffiti, or current ones like American Idiot, they don't happen all the time and rightly so.  That's why they are special.    Band of Horses' debut album was one of those magical pieces and therefore they set the bar quite high...maybe too high.  The follow up, Cease to Begin is a nice try and I do enjoy the work, but it doesn't touch Everything All The Time...not even close.  Infinite Arms (yes, this is a review of that piece, sorry for the digress) is another good piece of music and quite possibly better than Cease to Begin, but, once again, no match for EATT.    Clearly their style has noticeably changed without completely changing their sound.  It's a tighter sound and lacks the big sound of EATT with maybe the only exception being \\"On My Way Back Home\\", which I must say is quite a great piece and maybe the best track.  That change in sound could bea good or bad thing depending on your taste, but something tells me most BOH fans will feel somewhat let down.  It is what it is and I'm somewhat relieved, because I think they recognize that they are not going to repeat EATT so why not make some changes and go in a slightly different direction.  What I can say is that this style confirms what i have always believed in that BOH is very influenced by Brian and Carl Wilson.    My overall opinion of BOH is still that they are an exceptional band and one that will always have my attention.  I bought Infinite Arms without even a sample listen and would probably do the same for future releases.  They strike a chord with me (terrible pun) and will always be a \\"go to\\" listen whenever I just want to drift away.  If you're a BOH fan then I recommend you give Infinite Arms a whirl.  In the end I think you'll enjoy it as long as you don't expect \\"everything all the time\\" ; )
B002NWRMVS|3.0|Even though I own two of Ms. Jones albums, having just seen her on Good Morning America, where they have no blog of their own, I say that, from her appearance, she is out of character with her record label's rich legacy of archived performers such as Jimmy Smith and Mr. Cole.  Wherever Ms. Jones belongs, Blue Note can do better.  No, she is not bad, but disappointing considering her connection to Blue Note.

B003CIG7AE|4.0|\\"Infinite Arms,\\" the latest album from Band of Horses, is easy listening music for those who want to grab an RC Cola and a Moon Pie and sit on their porch swing and watch the sunset.  It is not a dance album for the nightclubs.  It is simply guitar-strumming music for relaxing while enjoying the great outdoors.  The artwork that came with the album is gorgeous.  I  had to scan and post them for you to enjoy.  There is a photograph for each song; on the back of the photograph is the title of the song and at least a brief snippet (sometimes a few stanzas) of the lyrics.<br /><br />  The artwork made me understand the title and theme of the album.  The photographs represent our country's beautiful heritage; infinite arms stretch from coast to coast, across mountains, prairies, farmlands and rivers.  These arms also reach high into the heavens.  Isn't our country beautiful?  There must be someone watching down upon us from above.  A band of wild horses runs free across this great country of ours.<br /><br />  On several occasions, I sat in the gazebo behind my home and listened to \\"Infinite Arms\\" while reading a humorous novel.  A warm breeze blew across my face.  The entire atmosphere was very relaxing and enjoyable.  The songs speak of what is important in life:  friends, neighbors, home, family and God.  \\"Factory\\" begins with a drum roll that announces that \\"Infinite Arms\\" is going to be a great album; the stringed instruments made this one my favorite song.  The guitar strumming of \\"Older\\" - my second favorite song - strongly convinced me that \\"Infinite Arms\\" is a country pop album; I wished its lyrics \\". . . . Don't want to understand why you never get older\\" applied to me.<br /><br />  \\"Infinite Arms\\" is highly recommended for those who enjoy country pop music.  It is suitable for all ages.  The music, lyrics and artwork remind me of the places and people I remember in my childhood.  \\"Infinite Arms\\" is very nostalgic.  It is highly recommended for those who want escapist music - music that is relaxing, soothing and reminiscent of a better time and place.  May Band of Horses continue its journey across our great country.  I look forward to listening to their future albums.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos- music that is relaxing, soothing and reminiscent of a better time and place.  May Band of Horses continue its journey across our great country.  I look forward to listening to their future albums.      Joseph B. Hoyos
B000001F9N|5.0|This is Donna Summer at her best! a great follow-up to \\"Love to love you Baby\\". Surely, the most impressive thing is the Suite \\"Try me, I Know, We can make it\\", with wonderful arrangements and the most strange and futuristic musical bridge at the time in a disco song... something totally unexpected, but Moroder always surprised us.     Her version of Barry Manilow´s \\"Could it be magic\\" it´s a great plus, with her sexy moaning that nowadays she regrets, because of her religion. \\"Come to me\\" is also a great song, a disco classic that sounds frequently on the airwaves. Even \\"Wasted\\" with it´s fabulous strings intro is a very energetic and danceable song. What else can we ask for? only 15 something minutes of more fabulous music that a record could keep. GREAT!
1878424114|5.0|The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is a tour de force, a spiritual masterpiece.  It is not, however, for everybody.  Do not let its slimness or big print fool you: this is a deep, profound book.  It requires an informed reader, someone capable of grasping such pearls of wisdom.  I see that there are numerous reviews giving it only one star, and the authors of most of them seem to have an axe to grind against Mr. Chopra, as though he were the subject of the \\"review\\" and not the book itself.  I am reading this book now for the third time, and working my way through it.  For this really is a workbook, a book to be slowly read, meditated on, and its methods PRACTICED.  If one simply reads it like any other book, like a mystery novel, say, then it will be just so many good ideas - in one ear, out the other, utterly useless.  Or, in the case of the many uninformed readers, or readers who do not have sufficient spiritual knowledge to appreciate this book, one will just see it as jibberish.  ANY book, from great classics such as Tolstoy's War and Peace to Marx's Kapital, will be found by SOME readers to be worthless, silly, etc.  This is not because the book IS those qualities but because certain readers simply lack the proper preparation for the book.  It is like a kindergartener trying to understand theoretical physics.  Nonetheless, this book can be read and understood best by someone with an understanding of Eastern philosophy, as well as someone who has read books on pop psychology such as the classic, Psycho-Cybernetics.  This book is easily understandable by someone with a high school education and some basic background in spiritual/metaphysical studies.  But do yourself a favor: read this book with a journal.  Read a chapter per day and consciously try to put into practice the advice.  Record the results in your journal.  Live this book, or it is just so much intellectual decoration.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|One of the most enjoyable business books I have ever read. The book has a very down to earth approach for those that want to be smart in building their business. The book is enriched with a lot of common sense and practical advice. I bought four copies (to give to the most motivated students in my E-Commerce classes).

B00328G4V6|5.0|First off let me say up front I've been listening to the Great Jimi Hendrix all my life. Am I obsessed? Possibly, Am I crazy? Maybe, Am I the biggest Hendrix fan in the galaxy? Absolutely! I own everything Hendrix ever made that's out so far. From all the bootlegs, To the Dagger Stuff, And by the way the dagger concerts are great! Pick them up when you can. I also own all the Michael Jeffery Estate Tapes. And I can say with out a doubt that VALLEY'S OF NEPTUNE is one of Jimi's great album's!!! That's right a truly great recording. I was totally shocked when I listened to it the first time. Jimi sounds great and the songs in there different mixes is phenomenal. The song Valleys Of Neptune is excellent. I can truly say this album is a classic! I would list it like this - #1- Are you experienced #2- Electric Ladyland #3- Axis:Bold as Love #4- Band Of Gypsys #5- First Rays Of The New Rising Sun #6- Valleys Of Neptune. That's right it is that good/great! So don't listen to all the naysayers who say this is just scraps or unfinished songs they are dead wrong. And for all you Hendrix fans out there, There is alot more where this came from. In the book BLACK GOLD - THE LOST ARCHIVES OF JIMI HENDRIX - It states that there are thousands of hours of unreleased music in the vault. They will be releasing Jimi's music for the next 50 years!!! So go buy this now! You won't be sorry! Long Live The Master Of The Stratocaster!!! Peace!
0307463745|5.0|This is full of common sense wisdom that can be applied to many facets of life.  Whats cool about it is that it contradicts most of the stuff out there written about business and leadership, but in a way that really makes sense, and so simple to understand that you'll be left wondering why you didnt see it that way before<br /><br />This is one of the easiest books to read since most of the chapters are about a page and a half long.  And it gets right to the point.  In fact it demonstrates the very things it's teaching.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for anyone, if you own a business, or work for someone, or even if you dont have a job.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|Not so great on historical fact, maybe, but what the heck. No storyteller of any age let literal truth get in the way of some healthy myth-making.<br /><br />This is definitely a modern retelling, with a Cate Blanchett giving ballsier Marian than ever - and a great match to the current Robin. I don't know if Godfrey, this movie's mad guy, appears elsewhere in the Robin Hood canon either, but the political maneuverings added pressure that helped keep things moving.<br /><br />Maybe purists won't like to see their beloved story adapted in any way. I found it a great bit of adventure, though, and an interesting take on the origin of Robin Hood. That movie ticket really earned its cost.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters

B0011Z10PC|5.0|If you don't already own Green Day's \\"American Idiot,\\" take advantage of Amazon's Deal of the Day and you will snag one of the best albums of the past decade -- an entertaining, often-thought-provoking, pop-punk soundtrack to the youthful alienation and frustration felt in suburbia during the Bush (\\"President Gasman\\") years.  You can now see the whole rock opera on Broadway, of course.  But from the blistering title track (\\"Welcome to a new kind of tension/All across the alien nation\\") to other essentials such as \\"Jesus of Suburbia,\\" \\"Holiday,\\" \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" and \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends,\\" American Idiot is an album you want to own for the songs as much as the story.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|This show, including the ending, is the best written, best produced piece of television to date.  Ignore the people complaining about the ending.  The major questions, the major mysteries were all solved and wrapped up perfectly. Every detail that really mattered to the story was answered.  I will go so far to say that the ending was beautiful and absolutely perfect in every way.  I find the people who complain about it being bad generally don't understand what happened.  There is a lot told in the imagery and emotions of the actors, not just the dialogue and what is straight-up spoken.  This show is deep, and one that needs to be thought about.  I definitely recommend everybody watch this show, in order, from the first episode to the last.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|If you are shooting video with interviews, this is probably the most important piece of equipment to have.  Substandard video quality can be forgivable if you have clear crisp professional sounding audio.    Of course, this isn't a wireless mic, but if you can get around the obvious physical restrictions, that can actually be a plus.  I once used a low quality wireless mic, and ended up with ear full of static (fortunately was recording with a second shotgun mic too), but with a wired mic you don't have to worry about any issues with interference or signal.  Honestly for standing interviews I feel a lot more comfortable knowing the signal is going directly by wire.  That way you pretty much know if you're seeing levels, you're getting usable sound, where as with wireless, those levels might be indicating white noise.    I've been experimenting lately with the art of mic hiding, and with a patch of gaff tape, you can stick to the inside of clothing and get terrific sound.  Just make sure there's not much friction happening between the actor and the tape, and let the sound flow in directly through the shirt, if gaff tape is covering the mic entirely, it will cut the frequencies and muffle the recording.    Anyways.. Yeah so this is a great lav mic which brings stationary interviews to a whole 'nother level.  Until you have the use for an expensive wireless system, get this.

As many have said, it really does look much better in person and clearly has the same level of quality as expensive department store watches.  Also, the clean white and polished steel design goes with casual and dress clothing equally well (IMO).  For my profession, I prefer the accuracy and ease of use with a quartz movement and this Invicta works beautifully.  Really, for the money, I don't think you can do better.

B002VECM6S|3.0|It would be easy to be cynical about \\"The Blind Side\\" - to point out how it's just another tale of a do-gooding rich white person condescending to help out a struggling minority; that it once again shows a minority at the mercy of the generous white folk; and that it is filled with heart-tugging but implausible Kumbaya moments designed to make us feel good about ourselves and our nobility.  Yes, it would be easy to do that, but the fact that it is based on a true story - that of Michael Oher who went on to play in the NFL - goes a long way towards nipping at least some of that cynicism in the bud.<br /><br />Based on the book \\"The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game\\" by Michael Lewis, \\"The Blind Side\\" is what \\"Precious\\" might have been had it been designed with a mass-audience in mind - a lump-in-the-throat, feel-good crowd-pleaser about a generally inarticulate, plus-size black youngster who's falling through the cracks big time due to poverty and wretched parenting. Only, in Michael's case, he's \\"rescued\\" by the Tuohy family - primarily the feisty, socialite mom, Leigh Anne - who not only provides him with a beautiful home and a loving environment but lessons on how to be a world-class football player as well.  A behemoth of a kid who's as shy and reticent off the field as he is aggressive and domineering on - at least once Leigh Anne has given him a good talking to - Michael doesn't seem nearly as scarred by his upbringing or as embittered towards humanity as one might expect given all he's been through as a child (he's certainly miles ahead of Precious in the coping department).<br /><br />True story or not, none of this comes across as all that convincing, and there are times when \\"The Blind Side\\" threatens to drown itself and us in a sea of sanctimony and sentimental uplift.  But it also manages to pull itself back from the precipice, at least periodically, thanks to the performances by Sandra Bullock - pushy and aggressive without being off-putting - and Quinton Aaron, who turns Michael into a sweet, likable kid.

B001N26GFM|5.0|This movie deserves way more credit than it has been given! Unfortunate events surrounding the time of World War II are portrayed in both blatant and subtle ways from the 8 year-old Bruno's perspective. He remains oblivious to the turbulence of the politics and war. He can see signs of violence (treatment of Pavel by the soldier, treatment of the soldier by Bruno's own father, the 'horrible smell' etc) but he is too young to guess or understand exactly what is going on. He makes friends with a Jewish boy Shmuel in the 'farm' and joins him to find Schmuel's missing father. He meets his death along with untold number of people in the 'shower room'.    It is for the movie watcher to decide if Bruno's father, the administrator of the 'farm' learned his lesson as a human being. Many such scenes in the movie provoke the audience to think and rethink. The 'soft' side of Bruno's father comes to light when he, upon insistence of his wife, decides to send his children away from the 'camp' area. But it is too late-the movie ends with the tough but grief-stricken father standing still at the shock of his son's murder. As tragic as it is, it is a very powerful presentation.

No, I didn't read the book and I never will. This is the most depressing, mindless, poor excuse for a movie that I've seen since \\"In the Name of the King\\". I think I'm going to go back to renting these things before I buy them. I now have a $20 drink coaster.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|First off I must confess, I do not like Rom/coms, or Rom/Drams, I would much rather watch anything and I mean anything than these genres, I feel they are stupid, unbelievable, mostly appeal to the female audience who like the unrealistic happy endings and when the guy says sweet nothings in the girl's ear, gag me with a fork....<br /><br />BUT this movie is not your conventional Romantic Comedy, it's your unconventional, romantic comedy that actually keeps it real and tangible, sorry for all you \\"The Note Book\\" movie lovers out there who expect sweet, happy tearful endings.<br /><br />Plot is simple, boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl dumps boy; Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) is a Greeting card writer whose hidden talent is architecture, meets secretary Summer (Zooey Deschanel) and we go through his trials and tribulations to win her heart. He's the hopeless romantic, she is the free spirit, wanting to keep things casual, doesn't want to fall into the norms of a relationship. Where Tom questions this relationship, where she wants to keep it simple and not muddle things. So 500 Days of Summer chronicles the bittersweet beginnings, the sudden break up and all the crazy/ befuddled/ frustrating things that go on in between.<br /><br />Basically that is the plot, what works is how it is presented, we do not get a linear plot like all those other contrite unreal romantic comedies, what we get is a non linear plot that goes back and forth between Tom and Summer's relationship from the Highs to the Lows. This is refreshing. Where one scene after Tom spent the night with her we see him walk out of the building all smiles the next day (this is his High), as if he can take on the world, he is unstoppable, as if he is glowing, and through out the whole scene we see him do a dance number, shaking hands with people, strangers high fiving him, patting him on the back, he looks in a window and an image of Han Solo looks right back at him... showing him he is the epitome of cool,  (what makes it so real is who hasn't felt like that, after spending a night with the one they love, feeling great the next day)<br /><br />Then we see his Lows, his self loathing, his obsessing on why did they break up, that he thought for sure she was the one, it's gut wrenching real, because again we've been there and done that or had it done to us.<br /><br />They try to maintain a friendship, Summer invites him to a party and Tom accepts and what we get from this scene is so unique: Where Tom hopes the Universe will finally align itself and his expectations coincide with his reality. A split screen of Tom walking up the stairs to her Apartment, the caption on the Left reads, Expectations, caption on the right reads, Reality, again we as viewers can relate to this scene as it unfolds, Tom's expectations are he and Summer some how reconnect, he gives her a small gift in the form of a book, there's the catching of each others eyes; holding the gaze, the hug, the gentle touching, the laughing, shared moments by themselves, but then he and us viewers are thrust into the reality of the situation. There is no rekindling, she thanks him for the book, through out the party he feels like a stranger in a strange land and he leaves the party in disbelief, in agony, heart broken.... much like what would happen in real life, as we always run through our heads what we think will happen and think will be the perfect evening; finally going to tell her how you feel, you have that nice dinner planned, flowers, she'll be flattered and happy, and say she has the same feelings about you. Thinking it is bullet proof and then to have it all crashing down: either she says she doesn't feel the same way bout you, or she can't make that dinner date, or met someone else, etc etc etc, we so want those events to work and have it play over and over in our minds so the outcome is always positive that when the time comes does it rarely play to our expectations and we are thrust into cold reality.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|The writing for this show is incredible.  The episodes do things most TV don't dare.  Each of the two first seasons had epic story arcs that closed at the end in a beautiful fashion.  The only other place you would find such great writing is in Firefly.

0810993139|4.0|[[ASIN:0810993139 Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]<br /><br />Concept:  As a volunteer at a local school, I was curious to see what all the excitement over the Wimpy Kid series was about.  Jeff Kinney's \\"cartoon in a book\\" concept is an excellent way to present and demonstrate the joys of reading.  Most of the kids who read the book, also saw the movie based on it, giving me the perfect opportunity to introduce them to that adult-like question; \\"Which did you prefer, the book or the movie?\\".  The ability of a story to alter a child's problem solving paradigm is a difficult concept to pull off, and Jeff Kinney does it well in this book.<br /><br />Execution:  The popularity of the book may be in part, due to the language and situations that children between 8 and 12 years old experience in real life.  But the book's characters take it a level further by flirtng with the absurd.  The book's language \\"tests the envelope\\" of what's socially acceptable, but uses humor to bring it back into the realm of suitability.  The danger of course, lies in turning what's tolerated today, into perfectly acceptable standards down the road.  Puberty is a battle between childhood and adulthood, and this book makes good use of exploiting this awkward time in a kid's life.<br /><br />Ah... Grammar :  Maybe it's only me, but I can't stand the \\"Me and Rowley started running...\\" thing that's so common in today's speech.  English is a living language, and I suppose I'll just have to accept it... But geez, it's aggravating.<br /><br />The moral of \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" takes a long, slow, humorous, thought provoking time to reach it's ethically correct conclusion.  It isn't obvious like in so many other books for this age group, but instead makes a subtle and playful appearance throughout the story and is wonderfully sprung at the end.  I enjoyed it and recommend \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" for everyone... Just be prepared to grit your teeth all all the \\"Me and Rowley\\" expressions and use them to provide alearning experience for your child.
B0039TD7PY|1.0|I received this 2 CD package and found that the first CD would not play.  In fact I am having problems with the CD changer now.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|How much longer will \\"Americanization\\" be synonymous with the lowest common denominator, aiming for the low hanging fruit, and willful ignorance? This version of a fantastic documentary is only one, and one of the most recent examples, but the profile is huge and obvious. We have become, in many respects, the laughing-stock of the world, and it's our own fault.     If you're considering the purchase of this otherwise wonderful documentary, make sure that you really want the Oprah version, by renting or borrowing one of the discs from each version before spending your money.     Perhaps...just perhaps, such high profile media examples will send a loud enough wake-up call to our very much ailing national culture. If not, then what's next? A version that's narrated with an opposing view of nature itself, that caters to our bitter and divisive politics? Perhaps we could have a version narrated by James G. Watt or Rush Limbaugh. Maybe we'll be able to order a set that comes with a coupon for Freedom Fries.    Before anyone snipes at me for sounding un-American...I say these things only because I do care. There's still time to pull out of this nose-dive.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Finally, after so many years of waiting, Daria has been released on DVD. My greatest concern, however, was how the updated music would compare. In all honesty, to a die-hard fan, the difference is noticeable. One of the great things about the show was the soundtrack; however, the wit and intelligence of the script makes you forget. The music feels appropriate and does not detract from the story. The quality is great as well(compared to watching it on TV). All in all, I am thrilled with the release and would recommend it to everyone.

0525421580|5.0|Two of today's most popular young adult authors have collaborated together on an entertaining journey into the lives of two characters, both named Will Grayson.<br /><br />Told in alternating chapters and voices, each Will Grayson is introduced to the reader.  Each Will slowly reveals the inner workings of their minds.  John Green's Will Grayson has bounced from his friend, Tiny Cooper, to a sporty group of friends, back to Tiny Cooper.<br /><br />Tiny is anything but Tiny.  He's a hulking gay football player of a boy.  Tiny is proud to be gay and is pushing to have the school let him put on his production Tiny Dancer: The Tiny Cooper Story.  Tiny always puts Will in crazy or uncomfortable situations.  Tiny is trying to set Will up with their friend, Jane.  Will is attracted to Jane but can't bring himself to pursue her.<br /><br />On the other side of the city is David Levithan's Will Grayson.  This Will is a loner.  His only friend is an Internet buddy, Isaac, who lives in Ohio.  There's Maura, a girl from school who thinks she's Will's friend, but Will finds her intrusive and bothersome.  Maura is convinced Will is gay, but Will refuses to divulge anything personal to her.<br /><br />As the story develops, both Wills unexpectedly find themselves in the same bizarre porn shop in Chicago.  Neither expected to be there, and  when they realize they have the same name, they find themselves sitting outside trying to figure things out.  Enter Tiny and Jane, and the night is about to get even more bizarre.<br /><br />Each author has a distinctive style, and it's quite easy to distinguish between the two while reading WILL GRAYSON, WILL GRAYSON.  I found one of the author's Will Grayson characters much more appealing than the other, but both are well-written and have fascinating stories to share.  But in all honesty, I thought Tiny Cooper stole the show!  He's such a large character (pun intended) and deserves a novel of his own!<br /><br />If you're a fan of either Green or Levithan or both, WILL GRAYSON, WILL GRAYSON will surely please.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  JaglvrYSON will surely please.

185984054X|4.0|This slim (98 pages) book by Christopher Hitchens is a major expos&eacute; revealing Mother Teresa as just another fundamentalist evangelist purporting to help the poor while raking in thousands upon thousands of dollars--very little of which actually goes to improving the plight of the poor and instead goes toward spreading her own version of Christianity. According to Hitchens, by her own admission, Mother Teresa is \\"a religious fundamentalist, a political operative, a primitive sermonizer and an accomplice of worldly, secular powers\\" (p. 11). Hitchens supports his analysis with documentation--first-hand accounts by those who have worked in Mother Teresa's sanctuaries, photographic evidence of her support for political dictators like Duvalier, and Mother Teresa's very own letter to Judge Lance Ito asking for mercy on behalf of the accused fraud and embezzler Charles Keating, from whom she received 1.5 million dollars in donations--every penny of which she kept even after the DA in the case against Keating wrote her a letter explaining the dishonest way in which those funds were raised. Furthermore, those who were indignant about Obama's being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize ought to examine the circumstances surrounding Mother Teresa's receipt of the award in 1979.  Hitchens has endured great criticism for taking on such a sacred cow as Mother Teresa and showing what a fraud she actually was. His own words explain his reasons better than any apologist ever could: \\"[Mother Teresa] herself purposely blurred the supposed distinction between the sacred and the profane, to say nothing of the line that separates the sublime from the ridiculous. It is past time that she was subjected to the rational critique that she evaded so arrogantly and for so long\\" (p. 98).
B001HN694K|4.0|As an Burton fan, I was not disappointed.  Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Anne Hathaway were perfect in their roles.  Mia Wasikowska was fantastic as Alice and I hope we see more of her in the future.  Some people complained that the Real 3D version wasn't what they expected, but I was quite pleased; the movie was like watching a giant View Master slideshow!<br />I bought the DVD edition because I don't see some big thrill in the Blu-Ray items.  Remember when we had VHS?  Disney is pushing Blu-Ray because it is durable.  Come on, really?  Treat your DVDs with care and respect and they will last forever.  More room?  There are only three short features on Alice in Wonderland, but I remember DVDs being able to hold a ton of information.  Disney, please STOP pushing Blu-Ray and cheating DVD fans out of features; a second disc of special features wouldn't have costed you much.
006621131X|5.0|Just finished reading Patti Smith's autobiography - or more specifically the story of her life entwined with Robert Maplethorpe.  Her writing tends to wander and play with words, since she is a poet - but her story is incredible.  From the smalls towns of South Jersey where I currently reside to living off the streets of NYC she has an optimism that simply could not be defeated.  Just one facet of her life is that (except for brief flashes) she never envisioned herself as a musician - just a poet and artist.  It was just twists of fate that lead her to rock stardom - but the book is pretty much over by the time that happens.      If you ever want to see, hear or read about one of the most amazing performers of our lifetime check her or the book out.
B002ZG994U|1.0|The A-Team wasn't shakespearian theater to begin with. But if Joe Carnahan  was actually going to deliver on a big screen adaptation of this iconic 80's series, he could have at least had the decency to get key elements right.<br /><br />First, they needed to have yes, been set back in time as Vietnam veterans. It probably seems weird and even inconsequential to some other people who also viewed the film. But when this series premiered, America was just beginning to recognize that the military does create psychological problems for soldiers/veterans, which the TV screenplay deftly capitalized on.<br /><br />The movie does not work portraying them as being involved with current wars--the 'edge' to the franchise characters gets lost. Ditto for being part of an elite team/government insiders.<br /><br />They are good guys, but they are also still supposed to be 'kooky' and not the everyday average type, from their having been in the military. They go underground and as a result of being framed and that resultant kookiness, start their own covert organization essentially the whole plot of the series. They are not supposed to be in tandem with the government!<br /><br />An entirely different movie should have been drawn up if people could not have been bothered to follow the original plotline when they were trying to execute a 'tribute'.I get the whole concept of using different actors, yes the originals--even Mr. T, were graying. But keeping the plotline is important. Otherwise call the movie something else entirely new and different.<br /><br />And then they are the type of kooks who do not go around killing people. The A-Team of the 80's was front loaded with more cheese than the Kraft factory. But somehow amidst all of the explosions and other plans, people never died. It was a live action GI Joe cartoon for the entire family to just sitback and enjoy.<br /><br />Not here in the movie. Body counts get racked up. Rather than already showing the ATeam already set up and going out on a mission, the scripting took considerable liberties. We did not need this--nor want it. It was unnecessary to the plotline.<br /><br />Another problem is the presence of sexual activity. This adds in another noticeable element which definitely was not in the original TV series. And even though I and other kids who grew up with Mr. T and the gang are now adults, this ruins our fun. It's like discovering that Santa Claus was really your parents all along. A part of our childhood is gone.<br /><br />There certainly are current films where such elements would be appropriate, but the A-Team was not one of them.ipting took considerable liberties.

B0011KQSZ4|4.0|I watched part of the first Death at a Funeral, online, after the remake came out, and a friend suggested I see the original. After a few minutes, I decided that I had to have the DVD.<br /><br />A family suffers the loss of its patriarch and attempts to have a dignified service. It doesn't quite come off without a hitch. (The first sign that there might be problems is the funeral home bringing the wrong body to the funeral.) This story has sibling rivalry, inadvertent drug abuse, unrequited lust, marital discord, pre-marital discord, nudity, hypochondria, a profane senior citizen, and an attempt at a double burial.<br /><br />I love British comedies, but, strangely enough, the best part of this one is the appearance of Alan Tudyk --born and raised in Texas-- playing the part of a fiance. He's brilliant, as usual. If I had my way, I'd cast Tudyk in every comedy for the next several years. Another delight is Peter Dinklage (playing the same part in the remake, by the way). As the bemused but determined stranger to the funeral \\"party,\\" he is quietly (and sometimes not so quietly) hilarious. (I'd cast him in every comedy for the next several years, too.)<br /><br />Recommended. ****
B000MXPE7Y|5.0|I had the fortune and the wisdom to see this movie while it was still in theaters. Despite being long, it is chilling when you take account how casual and frighteningly brutal an organization the CIA became from what arguably could have been called humble beginnings. I admit I could be called less than objective because I love Matt Damon and would see just about ANY movie he comes out with these days. People want to call it disconnected but this is emblematic of the intelligence  community. I found no fault in the story telling or the awesome cast that powered it. I found it creepy and was inclined to look around twice as I left the theater to make sure no-one was tailing me. It's the surgical, methodical cold blooded nature of Matt Damon's character that becomes a definitive trademark and one I can identify with as I aspire to it myself. If I had but ONE complaint, I would say that Angelina Jolie's role in this movie is woefully underdone but other than that, I found it excellent storytelling.

B002TYZKIM|4.0|THIS IS IT is now all there is. Watching this film in the DVD format in the home strikes many chords for almost every viewer.  Michael Jackson's life was made far too public and this brief recording of the preparations for his final tour sets much straight about why he was such a remarkable talent. It allows us to forget all the raucous press that hounded him during his life and simply watch Michael Jackson doing what he did best - perform. Some of his gifts can be listed. Creative body language that permanently influenced dance movements both popular and classical. Articulation of his sensitivity to even the minor details of his performances. Total involvement in whatever he performed.  His genuine kindness in dealing with both his troupe of musicians and dancers as well as his producers/stagehands/publicists.  A mind that could push the edges of entertainment like few others. A seemingly indefatigable energy level while rehearsing. A genuine love for his audience and yes, for life.  One could wish that the DVD showed the completed THIS IS IT show as there couldn't have been more than one more day of rehearsals before is tragic death.  But maybe that will come later.  What this DVD preserves is the quality of uniqueness that was Michael Jackson.  Grady Harp, June 10

B003A3K3JW|4.0|Remember that the Rite of Spring, so filled with much rhythm and bombast, brass and bravado, is about human sacrifice. Having listened to many recordings of this piece, I am often disappointed. I expect noir. Listening to this particular recording, Dudamel surprised me with a sensitive, studied account. It was indeed dark and dangerous...tough it lacked magic. I blame the engineering and hall acoustics, since the sound was somewhat muffled or dull and the orchestra was at a distance, with a flatness of perceived depth. This is a live recording and I felt far away. It is a shame, as Dudamel captured the spirit of the rite, and his youthful comrades set the standard for all youth orchestras.<br /><br />In contrast and more successful was the performance of Revueltas' La noche de los Mayas, with its folk elements. Until this album, I had only the less than satisfying version of Luis Herrera de la Fuenta and the Orquestra Sinf&oacute;nica del Jalapa. While the engineering was still off, it was less evident, and Dudamel's trademark excitement was in abundance. This is soul music for the Orchestra and the spark and energy was contagious. The last track, Night of Enchantment, was a percussive feast. In summary, if you do not mind small deficiencies in recording sound quality, this album is very worthwhile, as the performances are excellent. If you already have versions of the Rite of Spring, get it for the Revueltas.

It is the most depressing, bleak, pointless film I have ever seen. The actors are not at fault, its just a harrowing depressing TERRIBLE story. I could watch a film with a story, something you could take away from it. But this was just suffering and anguish. The only reason I even got half way through it was morbid curiosity, but I turned it off when the father finds a basement larder filled with half dead people destined for canabalism. This movie is about as enjoyable as walking on broken glass. If you feel like you need to feel depressed and hopeless, this is the film for you.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|The Legend of the Seeker is a GREAT fantasy epic. It is definitely worth its price, few series have such a well-balanced and likable cast for their characters. Everyone in the Seeker's team dynamic contributed significantly to the story's development. Craig Horner (Richard Cypher: The Seeker) made me feel a bit apprehensive at first considering that I have not seen him in many shows and he had a big role to fill in the whole \\"Destined Heroes\\" niche that is difficult to avoid being cliché. He does not disappoint. Horner possesses a charming and enviable sympathetic demeanor for fairness in a world ruled by a ruthless tyrant (Craig Parker). The Seeker's companions: Kahlan Amnell (Bridget Regan) and Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander (Bruce Spence) bring plenty of action, intrigue, cunning, (and little humor) into the story's plot without falter.     There were a few parts to the show that seemed a bit weak at first such as the occasional use of slow motion choreography or the somewhat too fortuitous events like a lone D'Haran soldier identifying the Seeker from a crowd of people by his sword.  In hind sight, these pet peeves made me like the series even more; the slow motion choreography displayed pristine sharp accuracy of the heroes fighting prowess that wowed me like in the original Matrix. And the events that seemed more than coincidental made me realize this series was written with a gravity that was deeper than I expected. I don't believe I would have complained about the sword giving away Richard if Horner were fulfilling the role of a Samurai whose identity was exposed by the make of his blade.    Overall this is a great series and is well worth watching! I can't wait for the second season to come out on DVD.

B002T9H2LA|2.0|Even in the fantasy world of Hollywood, this movie goes beyond the pale of plausibility and stupidity. The premise is that a small group of American, mostly Jewish, psychopaths, several of whom can't even speak a word of German (or French, or Italian or Spanish or even understandable English, like in the case of Pitt's character and his overdone southern accent) are sent to Europe during World War II, infiltrate the Nazi occupied countries and surreptitiously go on a long, endless killing spree of Nazi's without being detected.  Their \\"heroic\\" actions, in the film, lead to an event that ultimately ends the war. Tarantino's plot could have easily been dreamed up by Brad Pitt's alter-ego - Stu Pid.<br />  Perhaps some Americans, at least those who have never progressed past the 2nd grade or even looked at the pictures in a history book, may actually believe that this plot is somehow based on actual events. Unfortunately, in reality, my guess is that if the real Nazi's had been as lackadaisical about security as the one's in Tarantino's film, the United States would never have had to enter the war in Europe to begin with - the Germans would have easily and quickly been defeated by the Poles, the inept French or an angry troop of aggressive boy scouts long before 1941.  The problems with the plot of this movie are so numerous, I'm not sure I would be able to list them all even if I reviewed \\"Basterds\\" frame by frame - which in and of itself would be an incredibly nauseating task.  But the gaps in the story are more like gaping holes. The main character, Lt. Aldo Raine played by Brad Pitt, a good old boy from Tennessee who loves killing Nazis in any grisly fashion he can think up and then having his troops take their scalps.  Adding to the other problems here is the fact that the movie is heavily subtitled, something that can actually enhance the realism if done correctly, but here it is frequently done against backgrounds that are the same shade and color as the font.The story skips important details that would have made the plot flow more evenly, while dragging in far too many places. Some of the scenes are excruciatingly long.  And unbelievably, the Basterds murderous, noisy actions are never seen or heard by anyone else, even when they take place in a public venue - like a tavern. It's only the Basterds and their' victims.<br />  The Nazi's were heartless and cruel and one would be hard pressed to feel sorry for goose-stepping thugs who took part in the torture, killing and enslavement of millions of innocent men, women and children, but in this film, Tarantino's attempt to show the swastika wearing goons getting their come-up-ins, makes the viewer feel more empty and depressed than satisfied. To sum up, Basterds is a poorly executed extravaganza conceived primarily, I assume, to indulge those who would hope to see some imaginary form of macabre revenge exacted on unrepentant fascist bullies; the how things should have been if there were justice in the world factor for the Nazi executioners of millions of Jews and countless others. Unfortunately, it falls far short in nearly every department. Regrettably, the result is neither enjoyable nor entertaining to watch. It gets two stars instead of one because a few of the performances were good in, what was otherwise, a bad film.

B001SS3JS8|3.0|I've read a few of Jodi's books and must say thus far my favorite has been My Sister's Keeper.  The Pact was a good book; however, I would have preferred if the story was told in chronological order instead of bouncing between past and present.  I also felt unsatisfied with Emily's character because there were too many unanswered questions.  Lastly, I was extremely disappointed with the ending because having read My Sister's Keeper, I expected the ending to be a bit more heart-wrenching.    I definitely disagree with some of the reviews about the book being breathtaking and \\"not able to put down.\\"  It's a good story, I enjoyed reading it, but it left me feeling unsatiated.
B00005UQ9F|4.0|I think it was a good movie considering it was an idie film. It could have gone more in depth probably if it had a bigger budget but it did well with what it had.
B000MMN6YS|2.0|Why people give reviews on here for the film and not the blu ray is beyond me.  Don't you morons understand we don't care what you think about the movie?  This is a foreign blu ray review!!      So I got Das Parfum the German Import of Perfume and the disc is flawed. 5 stars for the film but 2 stars or better yet 1 star for the disc. The video looks great but the audio and video are not synced together properly.  The words do not line up with their mouth movements. The audio is a second off on the original English audio track. This ruins the German blu ray version. I am using the PS3 so my equipment is good. This is my only blu ray title where this problem occurs. Purchase at your own risk.
1557048630|5.0|I bought this book to change my art style. For years I've been drawing, and trying to break away from, anime.    When I saw this film, I was in love with the way it looked (and I'm not talking about the CGI - though that was certainly wonderful). I love how the characters were done in a unique style and I thought \\"I want to do be able to draw like that!\\" I spent hours (from 3 o'clock in the afternoon to midnight) drawing, tweaking, yelling at ink pens running out of ink, and trying not to get eyestrain under the light of a dying bulb and I can already see an improvement.    I have plenty of references to go off of; from Toothless to Astrid to Hiccup - they're all there. I even drew one of my (leaner) characters looking like Stoick the Vast and it's now push-pinned to my wall! If I wanted to draw props and atmosphere (I'll start later - too lazy right now) I could because this book gives me many a reference.    Needless to say, this book has proven to be quite helpful in my endeavour.  It's also stitched, not glued.
1931559317|5.0|I've been an amateur astronomer for over 50 years and have owned just about every star atlas published.  The Sky & Telescope Pocket Sky Atlas is by far the best general star atlas I've ever used.  It is a convenient compact size, yet the charts are quite large in size.  It is very well laid out, with page breaks adjusted to keep constellations together.  Most important, the type is larger and more legible than in any other atlas, important when you are trying to read it under a dim red light.  It contains enough stars for easy starhopping, and most of the deep sky objects any amateur is likely to look for.  It's one of the few atlases to include constellation figures.  Finally, the price is extremely reasonable.  Highly recommended!
B001QGRIO8|1.0|Because with this book, the series jumped the shark, BIG TIME!  The labor/delivery scene was attempting to be \\"edge of your seat\\" but it came out to be a mixture of the birth from \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" with all of the gore of \\"The Evil Dead\\" with just un touche of Gozu!  PLUS you have 3 different moderators or perspectives in the book. First up is Bella, the whiny pawn, martyr, lives only to serve men and suffer valiantly of the books talking of finally getting the man of her dreams even though she shouldn't have sex with him. Whoa is she jumping the gun! The lack of sex with your husband won't start for another 20-30 years!  Then she has sex with him and WHAM! Just like my high school nurse said would happen! Have sex once and get immediately pregnant! Also a bit type cast is the father of the baby urging an abortion.    Now the story has a new moderator in Jacob.  The pregnancy isn't going well (big surprise) and the baby is breaking bones and causing loss of blood which makes Rosalie feel it is steak night at the Sizzler and she is drug from the room.  After the kid is born it handily becomes a talking/walking child within days of delivery. Jacob involuntarily imprints himself onto the child after realizing the baby wasn't trying to kill Bella.    Back now to Bella, the newborn vampire Queen. She is enjoying her new role as mom because she has never had to change a diaper or worry over the baby's fever while teething those new fangs! Unfortunately there is always someone in the shadows to throw a pall over things. Another wacky vamp named Irina tells the Volturi the fun loving compassionate royalty of the vamps, that Bella and Edward had a baby that could be a threat to them. Oh, puhleeeeze!   There is now a family reunion of Cullens to prove to the Volturi that the baby is not an immortal child. After realizing they had been had by Irina, the Volturi immediately execute Irina. I told you they were compassionate!    Bella can now live happily ever after in her thraldom with Mr Perfect Face. Bella's newborn power is now a shield for the vampires which protects them from other vamps, werewolves, humans and insurance salesmen.    Now, where are my swim fins?
B001GAPC1K|1.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE SAW IT AT THE THEATER WHEN IT CAME OUT.  AS FAR AS THIS BLUE-RAY DVD THAT I PURCHASED FROM YOU, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT A FULL SCREEN DVD.

B0018BXMXW|5.0|Get this one.  What was the entire Side Two of the vinyl album (Eruption) is Focus, never better.  Guitarist extraordinaire Jan Akkerman earned his early fame with this album.  Focus's first album, 'In and out of Focus' is worthwhile, but not the LANDMARK that this album was.  The pre-Focus Brainbox CD, if you can find it, is an absolute KILLER, as well.  HOCUS POCUS sounded better on the original vinyl analog (all versions come from the old Mike Vernon tapes which were discovered in some old suitcase somewhere...really), so there are obvious aural limitations.  Somehow Moving Waves as a whole is preserved in a somewhat pristine state here.  The Red Bullet release is just a shade beneath the sound here (but still well worth purchase, as well).
B003EYVXSW|1.0|Hands down, this has to be one of the worst sci-fi/horror movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />SPLICE casually dissects a fascinating and controversial element of science--genetic engineering.  It had a fairly large budget.  A top-notch acting crew.  It was co-produced by the awesome Guillermo Del Toro.  Plus it's been praised by critics and audiences alike.  There was no way for me to expect such a horrific disaster.  Seriously, there were so many serious developments in this film that I was constantly cracking up at inappropriate times.  Some just unbelievably silly stuff.  The filmmakers had high hopes here but really created a monster turd.<br /><br />The problems with this film start from the onset and just metamorphosize from there.  Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley are never too convincing as the top-notch genetic scientists.  It's not really their fault though, as this script makes them out more like underground hobo science nerds.  They drive a ramshackle 70's Gremlin and live in a cruddy apartment.  I guess with the bad economy they were forced to take their jobs making minimum wage.<br /><br />So these two drastically underpaid researchers have fun splicing and dicing around in the billion dollar lab they work at.  They make an incredible medical breakthrough as they create a new life form.  The wormy creatures they conjour up look like cute little Tremors babies.  These slimy little buggers are strangely interesting, but really amount to nothing more than a scientific stepping stone.<br />The two genius gene doctors realize they are on the edge of something so much more.  With visions of possible cures for Alzheimer's disease or cancer, they want to incorporate human DNA into their experiments.  Unfortunately their boss shuts down this plan real quick.  So not fair.<br />Well, this doesn't slow the mad scientists from their medical pursuits.  Heck, it's for the benefit of mankind.  Luckily the pharmaceutical company pays little attention to their work or the resources they use.  So they buckle down for the rest of the night and are able to create a new half-human life form named Dren.  Boo-yah!  Dren rapidly develops some breasts and a lethal stinger tail, causing all sorts of unexpected problems.<br /><br />I really thought this story sped through all the scientific developments way too fast, making this questionable outcome even more implausible.  The making of Dren seemed way too easy.  Not to mention the fact that keeping this mutant baby a secret was way too far-fetched.  Still, at this point the story was holding my interest.  It was not until the couple smuggle their creation out of the lab that it reaches new levels of absurdity.<br />Dren's new home is in an abandoned farmhouse.  Instead of running more tests on this creature, both of the doctors become emotionally attached to their project.  Hugs, kisses, dressing it(her?)up, applying makeup, teaching Dren to slow dance...it gets so dang preposterous.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, but the nonsense here gets even more shockingly bizarre and flat-out stupid.  So many ludicrous moments, this movie derails like a bad train wreck. I couldn't help but glare at the screen with utter disgust and disbelief.  SPLICE has a very interesting premise, as it juggles scientific discovery with ethics and consequences.  I also enjoy seeing the horror genre receive critical acclaim.<br /><br />But I can't hop on this goofy, deranged bandwagon.  It violates a very serious genre of sci-fi horror with unforgivable missteps.  I'm telling you, it's bad, bad, BAD!  SPLICE has high aspirations but ends up being unintentionally funny.uckle down for the rest of the night and are able to create a new half-human life form named Dren.  Boo-yah!

B003FMTZOM|5.0|This is such an amazing album! Christina changed her direction again and she nailed it. Bionic is an album which combines playful, fun electronic songs and some serious ones (ballads). I love the diversity of the songs from mainstream songwriters to indie/alternative ones. M.I.A. + Peaches + Sia + Santigold + Claude Kelly = Perfection!  It is the perfect album for this summer, so make sure to get a copy!
0142001104|3.0|The summary of this book... Life is neither good nor bad, it's what you make of it... Well, thank God this book is only 200 pages to come up with that conclusion. I wanted to love this book based on the reviews here and a recommendation I received elsewhere. Well, I will just say I was a bit disappointed. I hope you find more in the book should you choose to read it and maybe I will revisit this book down the road to see if it was just the wrong time in my life to tackle this one.

B0019OP0GU|3.0|I just purchased this film and watched it twice for a fair review. I thought the beginning and the ending was rushed; especially the ending. Too much smoking. Loved the characters and thought they were well cast. I bought it for grand daughters and don't know if I'll lend it to them because of the excessive smoking. I guess I anticipated something more like \\"The Railroad Children.\\"
072325804X|5.0|Beatrix Potter, The Complete Tales is one of the most charming childrens books ever. I enjoy reading the stories to my grandchildren, and they have enjoyed them well past the age when one would think they were too old for them. This purchase was to replace a copy that had become too fragile to read.
B002ZG997C|5.0|BEST movie of 2009.  Acting, cinematography, directing and acting by DW.  Don't miss this one  even if you know the \\"surprise ending\\" it's just fun to watch over and over and look for clues.
0307454541|5.0|This book is great. I wasn't sure what to expect, because I read it after it has already gotten a lot of hype. Often if a book is overhyped, it not as exciting as the build-up, but this book was really exciting. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It wasn't just your every day mystery, there were deeper gender issues and an unpredictable plot. I highly recommend this book.
B001HN694K|5.0|I have read the other reviews, those who thought Tim Burton missed the mark in this remake to those who thought Burton out did Disney. PEOPLE wake up its just a movie a another person take on the Alice in Wonderland idea. I personaly enjoyed the movie, the special effects, actors portrale of Mad Hater, Alice, the Red and White Queen and so on. Films will alway will be made by a directors vision of the story. I have the Original Disney cartoon \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and will always cherish the film, this version will now be added to my collection as a continueing Alice story.
030726999X|2.0|Recognizing that this book in \\"The Girl . . .\\" trilogy was published posthumously and was translated into English, I nevertheless profoundly regret that the folks at Knopf barely gave its editing a \\"lick and a promise.\\"  The two previous novels in the trilogy rambled a bit and over-used the now perfunctory f-word, but this last novel over-did everything from the number of characters to the repetition of mundane details.  The first 300 pages were agonizingly slow.  Not until the mention of the immortal character of children's books, Pippy Longstocking, did the plot develop a pace worthy of the invocation of her name.  I passed the other two Larsson novels on to friends but not \\"...Hornet's Nest.\\"
B002QGUFWE|2.0|Is it fair to call Lady Gaga the KISS of dance pop? Whenever I see KISS going crazy with their costumes and pyrotechnics, I expect to hear outrageous music to fit the image. So of course I'm disappointed to hear that these clowns from outer space only belt out safe, nondescript 70's rock. The music could be worse, but the image feels like a bit of a cheat. Definitely adds to the letdown.<br /><br />Similarly, Lady Gaga's not terrible, but her image and reputation suggest that her music should be more distinct and edgy than the songs on her first two releases, \\"Monster\\" included. Her music recalls early 90's europop, late 90's diva trance, and, of course, Madonna. She can carry a tune, unlike Britney and Katy Perry, but her songs are too slickly produced, lacking in personality, and often drowning her vocals in over-glossed bleeps and tweaks. Even Ke$ha's yawned-out \\"Tik Tok\\" has a bit more attitude to it.<br /><br />And then there are the melodies. \\"Paparazzi\\" sounded too much like Solange's \\"Sandcastle Disco\\" for my comfort. Here, \\"Bad Romance\\" is basically \\"Poker Face 2: The Rave Years.\\" And \\"Alejandro\\" sounds like an obvious fusion of \\"Don't Turn Around\\" by Ace of Base and \\"La Isla Bonita\\" by Madonna (and of all the people to steal from, why Ace of Base? Next time, at least go for someone interesting, like Fever Ray).<br /><br />I liked \\"Poker Face.\\" And there is some promise in the other stuff. But unless she actually starts taking risks with her sound, her image will continue to be what Peter Kriss' cat make-up was for KISS--an empty marketing ploy.<br /><br />Here's hoping she turns her fame into a monster that actually has a pulse.
B002XMGGK6|4.0|\\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" is a thriller with a fairly unique twist in that the bad guy is already in prison when he gets serious about killing people.  The victim of a brutal home invasion, Clyde Shelton ([[ASIN:B00009XN4C Gerard Butler]]) has to watch as his wife and daughter are savagely murdered.  Then the American criminal justice system adds insult to injury when Philadelphia assistant district attorney Nick Rice ([[ASIN:B000Y7WGOW Jamie Foxx]]) decides to plead the case out, despite the protestations and outrage of Clyde.  The details justifying the plea bargain are rather nebulous, because the main idea is to set up the profound sense of injustice that will send Clyde off the deep end.  Even if Clyde's eye-witness testimony would be suspect in court, it is certainly enough for Nick to make sure that even if the letter of the law dictates that both criminals are equally culpable for the murders that the one Clyde insists did the actual killing is not the one who gets the better deal.  Certainly the D.A. can make the same deal with the other guy.  But the devil is not in the details here, so all that really matters is that Clyde sees Nick shaking hands with the scum of the earth who killed his family.  Once the prologue is ten years past, we get to the execution of the guy who got the short end of the deal and things go horribly wrong.  Then Nick uses a more direct approach to dispatch of the thug who did the actual killing, showing a flair worthy of [[ASIN:0385496982 Dante]] or [[ASIN:B0006SSOHC Jigsaw]].<br /><br />I would say that my problem with this 2009 film is that my sympathies are way more with Clyde than with Nick, but to tell the truth I did not mind rooting for Clyde, even though he is admittedly not in the same class as previous guilty pleasure bad guys like [[ASIN:B00014K5ZA Richard III]] and [[ASIN:B00005LINC Hannibal Lecter]].  The main selling point of the movie is that you get caught up way more with \\"what\\" he is doing and \\"how\\" he is doing, especially since you already know the \\"why.\\"  Each \\"what\\" is a fairly sophisticated way of disposing of the people on his hit list , while the \\"how\\" has to do with the fact that for most of the movie Clyde is not only in prison, but in solitary confinement.  Screenwriter Kurt Wimmer, who also wrote the script for the remake of \\"[[ASIN:6305657947 The Thomas Crown Affair]],\\" certainly knows how to come with elegant crimes, although this time around the goal is to kill people rather than steal paintings, and I like the explanation for how Clyde is able to do all that he does, once we finally get around to the origins of his peculiar set of skills.  Beyond that, Nick does not fit the bill as a worthy hero, not only because he is slow to catch on that people are dying because he is several moves behind in this killer chess game, but also because he fails to see himself as being culpable in any way, shape, or form for the gross injustice that set all of this in motion.  The more Nick stuck to his \\"principles\\" and refused to follow Clyde's instructions, the more I was actually hoping for an ironic ending where Nick literally feels Clyde's pain.  Director F. Gary Gray (\\"[[ASIN:B0000B1OFL The Italian Job]]\\") goes a bit over the top with the big ending, which really runs counter to the feel of the rest of the film, but that is probably what happens when the mandated ending is an attempt to balance the scales before the end credits.  After all, we cannot have somebody bringing down our criminal justice system, can we?  Consequently, \\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" is one of those films where the journey is better than the final destination.<br /><br />This last paragraph is only for the eyes of those who have seen the film, so beware: there be spoilers here.  While watching this movie I was bothered by the whole idea that Clyde Shelton has an accomplice who works as the \\"Mr. Outside\\" counterpart to his \\"Mr. Inside,\\" simply because there are really no logical possibilities to who that might be.  A lot of times in movies you can figure out the surprise because there are only a limited number of possible suspects.  So I was pretty much convinced they were going to have to pull one out of left field, and was actually pleased when they avoided doing that.  However, I was less enamored with the convenient mistakes that Clyde made to allow Nick to put two and two together in the final reel.  I also understand why Nick was so slow to catch on to the fact that Clyde has already put everything in place before he made his first demand behind bars.  Of course, the more I think about this film the more flaws I find in it, even if they were not painfully apparent during my first viewing.  However, I find it interesting that most of my thoughts are about the few but key changes Clyde could have done to ensure his plan played out to its intended end.A lot of times in movies you can figure out the surprise because there are only a limited number of possible suspects.

I have the import version which has 18 total Tracks.  Unfortunately most of these Tracks are skits, which in my rating system automatically get a one star rating.  If you take out the skits and the Bathtub intro this album becomes a five star rated album.  What I may do from now on is give two ratings at the beginning.  I know some people don't even count skits and intros and stuff like that.  So yes in reality this is a great Album ONE OF THE BEST OF ALL TIME.  Everybody should have this in their collection.  This is a Classic from start to finish minus the skits, but even some of the skits have supplied jokes for years.  Bottom Line Great Album buy it.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|Although the film is a bit dated, the actual race scenes are still spectacular. Frankenheimer is absolutely the best in giving a visual treat to the viewer. His montage style filming was way ahead of its time. The actual tracks, and the simulated cars are simply the best racing sequences ever filmed. If you like F1 racing, you'll enjoy the classic race cars and tracks. However, its the extra dvd that really makes this a must buy. The interviews, and the documentaries are informative and wonderful to watch. The Making of Documentaries 40th Anniversary are absolutely a must see for any race fan. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|When I first started posting reviews here umpteen aeons ago, I swore to myself that I wouldn't read other people's reviews before contributing my own. Then I got too curious & broke my own rule. Now I generally read one good review & almost all of the really bad (one star) ones. It never ceases to amaze me that each group saw the same film. Personally, I think a lot of it is sheer emotional reaction, but I still find it informative.<br /><br />Take SHUTTER ISLAND. I agree with the people who found DiCaprio's performance less than stellar, but not too bad. There are two problems I've experienced with his acting as seen in other films. He does this sort snear, curling his mouth up & then combines it with a sort of sorting look. I think it's supposed to look \\"working class tough,\\" but it lacks authenticity to me. [Tom Cruse did the same sort of thing in WAR OF THE WORLDS, but then I don't think many people expect authenticity from him.] The other thing about DeCaprio is that he doesn't handle accents very well--actually, not well at all. Following his outstanding portrayal of an autistic boy in WHAT'S EATING DELBERT GRAPE? there are fans who do expect authenticity from him.<br /><br />All that aside, feminine eyes might glow in the scene where his character wears a \\"wife-beater\\" (tank top style, white cotton undershirt, ain't post-modern fashion grand?), clearly indicating that the lad has been working out.<br /><br />Well, that's about all the sex you'll get in the movie, but that's not so bad...?<br /><br />Being an unrepentant 60's Tripster, I liked the psychedelic overtones in the film, as well as the cinimatography, set design, use of color, the highly atmospheric overall \\"feel\\" and, of course, the direction of an American Master. The end left things unresolved, but it may always provide a hook to watch this mysterious ISLAND again.<br /><br />Oh yes, Ben Kingsley was appropriately diabolical looking & acting. Max von Sydow was almost unrecognizeable & diabolical as well.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I'm a history junkie, but usually I prefer to read about it and let my all-to-vivid imagination do the rest. However, to anyone who feels as I do, I heartily recommend this series. I've never been so bowled over by the sumptuousness of King Henry VIII's court and the costumes, music and dancing are gorgeous. It's true the producers saw something in Johnathan Rhys Meyers to make them overlook the fact that he bears no resemblance to the middle-aged Henry (I've seen the king's suit of armor and two Meyers's could fit in it!), but I think that Meyers has captured something of the king in his performance, which for me makes up for not wearing padding under his clothes.    There really was no existing portrait of Catherine Howard, and I complain just a bit that Joely Richardson bears no physical resemblance whatsoever to Catherine Parr. Also, I wrote a college research paper on whether \\"Anne Boleyn Deserved to Have Her Head Cut Off,\\" and found no evidence that she was a secret Lutheran. Small faults in what we know to be true can be found, but they matter not. (Look for Henry Cavill's understated but outstanding performance.) This is as close as you're likely to get to a 16th century court on the ascendancy.
0061922315|5.0|A moving and thought-provoking novel.<br /><br />This story takes place in a remote Indian village. On the eve of the monsoons, Kavita gives birth to a baby girl who is not wanted by her husband, Jasu. He takes the baby, disappears for a couple of hours and returns without her. Kavita does not know what he has done. A couple of years later, Kavita again gives birth to a daughter whom she decides this time her husband will not take from her. She secretly makes plans with her sister Rupa to walk miles and miles to another village to leave her baby daughter at an orphanage with the hope she will be adopted and have a good life. The baby girl has the most beautiful \\"gold\\" coloured eyes, just like Kavita.<br /><br />A couple of years later, Kavita again gives birth but this time to a boy Vijay whom her husband Jasu adores but he turns out to be a huge disappointment.<br /><br />In America, Somer and Krishnan, both doctors can't seem to conceive. After a few brutually upsetting miscarriages, they decide to adopt a baby from Krishnan's home country of India. Somer is American but the waiting lists here are much too long. They travel half-way around the world to pick up their new baby daughter, the one with the most beautiful \\"gold\\" coloured eyes!<br /><br />The novel interweaves the stories of Kavita, Somer, and the child that binds both of their destinies. Each chapter flips between Kavita and Somer which I love.<br /><br />The characters are beautifully developed, the story well-written and you won't want this one to end. I'm keeping this in my permanent collection along with Rohinton Mistry's \\"A Fine Balance\\".<br /><br />I would love to see Ms. Gowda write a sequel to this!!!! I need to know how Asha/Usha fares in the rest of her life and all of Krishnan's relatives and especially Kavita, Jasu and Vijay.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|Here is one the critics didn't think too much off, but both the wife and I found it enjoyable.  If you have seen the other Terminator movies, this fills in some good information on the series.  It is well acted and has plenty of action and I thought a very good story line.  One mans opinion but I recommend it for all action movie viewers.

B001TOD9VI|5.0|This was easily the best Drama of 2009. The movie takes you into the world of a washed up, beat up, retired, wrestler doing what he loves, but paying for years of neglect. The movie is very dark, but has enough uplifting moments to keep things from becoming depressing. Micky Rourke does an amazing job in this piece.
B00288KNL8|5.0|This is a very different movie.  A little creepy...may be too scary for little ones.  My 5 year old thinks it is cool.  He doesn't understand some parts of it, but is intrigued and watches the whole movie in one sitting.  Recommend parents preview it before showing it to little ones.  Will depend on your child.  Like I said, mine thinks its cool.
B001QOGYBI|4.0|I had heard much hype about this film, and I didn't really pay it much attention.  But recently, I didn't have much on my plate to rent, so I decided to give this a try.  Does it live up to its hype, at least for me?  Well, not really, but it was still a pretty good film.    The stop motion is interesting; they went for a jerkier feel, presumably to give it a stylistic flair that's different from other famous stop motion movies such as Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (which is beautiful, by the way).  I didn't mind the animation once I got used to it.  It does give the film some charm.     My main problem with this film is that other reviewers seemed to find it hilariously funny, but I just didn't laugh once.  I didn't even chuckle.  This film felt more like a study of familial interpersonal relationships than a comedy, and I guess it succeeded in that.  I felt like it was thought-provoking on many levels, one of them being the recognition of patterns of behavior that should be familiar to anyone who had even a mildly dysfunctional family.  On another level you could interpret the film's animal cast as a metaphor for the human condition.  When Mr. Fox got on his soap box (literally) at the end of the movie and made his little speech about appreciating what they had despite the fact that everything seems fake (\\"these apples look fake, but at least they have stars on them\\"), it made me think about our own society in that we've progressed technologically far past what our species is actually adapted for.  So yes, much of the way we live is fake, but it's still got its benefits and perks.  I liked how the animals' seemingly civilized behavior (wearing clothing, reading newspapers) was contrasted with their animalistic side (devouring food, growling at each other); once again, I saw the parallels in humanity - perhaps, we too, are just wild animals.      One last thing - at first, I found it difficult to like Mr. Fox.  He's just so self-centered that it can be difficult to relate to him.  However, by the end of the film, I warmed up to him.  He's clearly a flawed protagonist, but I have a soft spot for flawed protagonists, and he does redeem himself.  At the end of the day, he is awfully charming.      So, I do recommend this film, but perhaps not as a comedy nor even a family film since many of the themes are very adult.  Definitely rent this first before you buy, since you may or may not like it.  Overall, though, I liked it.
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|Our little guy loves this movie.  We watch it at least once a week.  One of those not too violent superhero movies that I don't feel guilty about letting him watch.  It arrived quickly and as expected.  Great family movie!

B0024RIMBG|3.0|[[ASIN:B0024RIMBG A New Journey: Live at Slane Castle]] This is great DVD and everyone who has seen it with us is very impressed. There is only one fault that I can find with the DVD. There are no subtitles with the music. This was very depressing for some one who is hard-of-hearing as I am. There are subtitles on the extras but none with the music. When I saw this on Public TV there were subtitles so I presumed they would be present on the DVD. I have tried to enter my comments on the Celtic Women website but there is no place to do so. If the subtitles had been present I would have rated this DVD 5 Stars.
B001D08SK0|2.0|Like other reviewers, I'm not focusing here on the music or the sound quality.  I'm just adding my warning to the others.  (I should have listened to them, but I thought \\"mine will be different.\\"  Ha!)        So putting aside the music and the sound quality, DO buy this set if you don't mind purchasing brand-new LPs and CDs that are pre-scratched and pre-scuffed for you.  DON'T buy this if you expect new merchandise to be, well, new.

B00138Z97C|5.0|There is so much to enjoy on these wonderful recordings, some of them available for the first time on CD, which demonstrate Montserrat Caballe's extraordinary versatility. Strauss, Granados, rare operas arias, zarzuelas, duets with her husband Bernabe Marti and with the great Shirley Verrett: it's all here. It would take too long to comment fully on the contents of these 15 CDs, but for me the highlights are the Verdi Rarities which I still have on LP, and the delightful Zarzuela Love Duets. I will come back again and again to the recordings in this much welcome release!

1400052173|5.0|I'm usually a fiction reader, but this one caught my ear when I heard an interview with the author on a number of NPR shows.  I could not put it down.  It is interesting on many levels - from a scientifc perspective, from a history view, but, most interesting was the human viewpoint...... what if it had been YOUR mother???  I've recommended to several people and actually bought copies to send to 2 of them - I don't do that often.

Kurt Russell even acted with an injury, you can't tell when watching it. It even has a couple of tear jurking moments. It is a must also if one likes combat/action. Enjoy!
B000002IOJ|4.0|I have to admit that I am not an aficionado of thrash or speed metal. I worship mozart for starters. However, I am a big fan of a good electric guitar. Now there are many thrash bands that have come of the the same era as well as area, but Metallica usually takes the cake. Testament is every bit as good and Skolnick is tremendous; his playing simply stands out and would prick the ears of any classically trained musician. Heavy without losing virtuosity.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I didn't feel this movie lived up to the hype.  While the special effects were great the story line left something to desire.  When you saw the trailer for this movie it looked like there was going to be a lot of action but when I saw the movie the action didn't really get going until near the end.  Overall it was just a 3 to 3.5 to me.  It just didn't live up to the hype.
B003DZM54I|4.0|I'll say it right away; I'm a huge fan of Motley Crue, there's no surprises there I suppose. I also followed Vince Neil's solo career after he was fired/quit Motley Crue, I liked his solo albums for what they were especially 1993's \\"Exposed\\". After his second album \\"Carved In Stone\\" (1995) Vince reunited with the Crue and has not released anything solo since then except one live album (which was all Moltey material and only one solo song) and a single \\"Promise Me\\" in 2005 which was supposed to be featured on an upcoming album that never quite happened. So here we are in 2010 as Vince Neil is about to release his first studio solo album in 15 years \\"Tattoos and Tequila\\", a cover album which Vince says sees him cover some of the artists who influenced him like Cheap Trick, Aerosmith, ZZ Top and Scorpions. The album contains 10 covers and two new songs including the title track and \\"Another Bad Day\\". The new single \\"Tattoos and Tequila\\" is available for free on Amazon or from Vince's official website (you get the video as well from the website). Neils' upcoming biography due latter in 2010 is also called \\"Tattoos and Tequila\\".<br /><br />Okay the lyrics to the song are not innovative at all but it doesn't really matter its good time rock what's wrong with that? Not everyone wants to listen to a song with a complicated story or one of incredible depth( even if I thought that Vince's single \\"Promise Me\\" showed a lot of depth from his part), well not all the time. It's a cool summer track in a way and the chorus is a little cheesy but catchy. The musicians playing with Neil this time around are Jeff Blando on guitar and Danna Strum on bass both from Slaughter along with Zolthan Chaney on drums. I definitely like the guitar work it sounds very good, Vince's voice sounds excellent as well (I don't if he used pro-tools on his voice or what but he sounds great anyway) and with those lyrics there's no question that it's Vince Neil!<br /><br />I don't think \\"Tattoos and Tequila\\" will really impress anyone and at this point in his career I don't think Vince really cares about that, but I think it's a good song and that fans will like it for what it is. It's not the best thing Vince's ever done but I still like it, however I can't give higher than 3 ½ stars, interesting song but not entirely satisfying.press anyone and at this point in his career I don't think Vince really cares about that, but I think it's a good song and that fans will like it for what it is.

B003JYOEYM|1.0|As the dumbest zombie movie ever. Worst acting ever, and wasn't the sergeant also in \\"land of the dead\\" and he died in that one; as soon as I saw his face it was very hard to get into it. And the ending with the zombies and they just randomly start eating the horse for no reason what so ever especially when there was the living around.They were also touching the zombies and the zombies weren't aggressive at all. I love your work george romero but this was just a waste of my time and anyone who watches this movie is a fool. Waste of time.
B000002H6C|5.0|Two years after the death of bassist Cliff Burton,Metallica bounced back and released \\"...And Justice For All\\" in 1988 with new bassist Jason Newsted.It reflects the anger and sadness towards Cliff's death and Metallica made what is undeniably their most complex album here,with many tempo changes and the album has \\"Anger!\\" written all over it.This release is just as good as the previous releases of the band if not better.Its full of epic songs such as the title track,\\"One\\" and \\"Eye Of The Beholder\\", actually all of the 9 songs on the album are no less than 5 minutes each and many of them are considered classics of Metallica.This album is actually considered by some fans as the last trash metal album Metallica ever made,and in some cases the last good album they did.While those opinions are certainly discussable \\"And Justice For All\\" is certainly a great album from Metallica,and I believe that it is their last Trash Metal album. Actually at times it seems to be even more raw and heavy than some of their other albums and it contains \\"To Live Is To Die\\" a song on which former bassist Cliff Burton wrote the lyrics and that is mostly a tribute to Cliff.<br /><br />\\"...And Justic For All\\" is a masterpiece from beginning to end. Filled with long Epics and you can feel that each musician here except newbie Jason Newsted (Jason's bass is buried somewhere under the guitars, you can hear it at times but it's not a HUGE presence) play to their full potential.If you didn't think Lars Ulrich was a great drummer before this album,you will as Lars is really focused here its probably the album he plays best on.Kirk Hammett probably never played better and Jame Hetfield's vocals are unleashed!They all play great here but Jason Newsted is notably absent from the album as you don't hear much if any bass at all it seems as it was erased or just never done so the album is just guitars.Some say that the bass's sound is buried under the massive guitars and it could be true.Because of that the album sounds real raw but that's how some metal heads like it,if you want one of their more sophisticated release you are at the wrong place.This is pure Metallica,you already can picture them playing with their ripped jeans and t-shirt just getting down to the metal business,they don't do glam things its just about the music and this album reflects that nicely.At least that's who they were in 1988...<br /><br />I previously said that this album had some of Metallica's best songs and I'm getting to that point right now.I have to start with my personal favorite \\"One\\" which is an impressive song at 7:27,its a great near ballad with some aggressive pace changes and i would have to nominate this particular song as one of Metallica's best songs if not their best,you can just feel the anger in it trough Jame's voice I like it!The opener \\"Blackened\\" is a strong album opener,nearly has a scary feel the sudden change of tempo is nicely done and the lyrics are awesome a great song.The title track is another epic,this one is pretty long as it is over 9 minutes!Many listeners won't get to the end of it,its underrated.\\"Eye Of The Beholder\\" is amongst the best songs of the album,another anger-filled song.\\"The Shortest Straw\\" has a great chorus and is great overall,its unappreciated of you ask me but its pretty good stuff.<br /><br />I won't say anymore,the songs are terrific and this album is definitely worth a listen.\\"...And Justice For All\\" is often forgotten because it was made between the classic \\"Master Of Puppets\\" and their commercial success,the \\"Black Album\\" or \\"Metallica\\" if you prefer.It shouldn't because it is as good as those two albums if not better and has amazing arrangements and complex songs,along with an overall dark feeling and a touch of anger everywhere. If you want to hear unleashed Metallica THIS is the place!Its a masterpiece for a metalhead like a Picasso would be for an artist. Also this was the last album before they went the commercial road with their next album \\"Metallica\\" in 1991(Actually they started to be commercial for this album,they made a video when they said never would make any)this is definitely their last true trash metal album. 5 stars all the way.a\\" in 1991(Actually they started to be commercial for this album,they made a video when they said never would make any)this is definitely their last true trash metal album. 5 stars all the way.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|Here is a karate kid for the new generation. I worry about movie remakes, especially when the original has become iconic for so many people, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out how good this version is.<br /><br />The main character, Dre (Jaden Smith), gives new meaning to being the new kid in town. He and his mother (Taraji P. Henson) move from Detroit to  China for her job (I don't actually remember seeing what it is she does for a living, but... I guess that's not the point of the movie). Dre is a black, cornrow wearing American living in Beijing. He is not thrilled about being there but things look up when he spots the pretty Mei Ying (Wenwen Han).  Mei Ying's parents want her to focus on her musical talents and not on a boyfriend, but she and Dre develop a friendship and try to spend as much time together as possible.<br /><br />Their relationship draws unwanted attention from the school bully, Cheng (Zhenwei Wang). Cheng attends a kung fu school run by a master who tells the students, \\"We do not stop when our enemy is down\\" and Cheng takes that message to heart.  As is typical with most bullies, Cheng has a group of boys who follow him and they make it a point to torment Dre every chance they get.  Smith does a good job of showing the fear of trying to stay one step ahead of a bully, hiding around corners until Chang and his gang have passed. Finally, Dre can no longer outrun Cheng, and he wants to learn to fight back.<br /><br />Enter Mr. Han (Jackie Chan in all his choreographed amazingness), who takes Dre under his wing and shows him some moves. Han actually teaches Dre kung fu moves rather than karate, but you don't wanna go messin' with a name people already know.  Mr. Han uses some unconventional ways to train Dre, but not exactly the same methods as Morita used with Macchio in the original movie.  Although Chan does not have much dialogue, he is great at playing the mentor and at showing the anguish of past events. It was interesting seeing him play a more serious role.  Mr. Han is the teacher, but in many ways, he needs Dre as much as Dre needs him.<br /><br />The movie has plenty of laughs delivered by both Smith and Chan.  Also, even though I knew, in general, what was going to happen, I still found myself whipping away a few tears (typically for uplifting moments, though).  As a nice bonus, there are some great scenes showing the beauty of China including Dragon Well, the Great Wall, and the Forbidden City (which doesn't appear to be so forbidden anymore).<br /><br />Smith's character is 12, but he looks about 10 because of his diminutive size.  It is disturbing seeing Dre getting beat down, particularly during one brutal scene at the beginning. However, your older kids can definitely watch this movie because the lessons they'll learn about discipline and respect and facing their fears more than make up for any violence they'll see.  The movie is called \\"The Karate Kid,\\" so expect some violence.<br /><br />Like the original, I found this to be an enjoyable, uplifting film. I recommend this movie and I actually give it 3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars, but since that rating is not available, I'm rounding to a 4.<br /><br />Oh, and watch out for Jaden Smith. I had intended to not compare him to his father, Will; however, there were so many times in the movie where I saw some of Will's swagger in Jaden, down to similar facial expressions and comic timing. The kid can actually act + young girls will dig him = he will be around for awhile.ole.  Mr. Han is the teacher, but in many ways, he needs Dre as much as Dre needs him.

B000002H97|4.0|In 1991 Metalica releases a self-titled album,\\"Metallica\\" or the black album as some fans like to call it and it was a major commercial success (15X Platinum and over 22 millions sold) earning the band plenty of air time on the radio stations and is one of the best selling album of not only Metallica's career but of all time as well.Its easy to see why; the songs on this album all have slower tempos and they are shorter than usual for the band and perhaps easier to get into for those who were not big trash or Metallica fans.Some fans of the trashy 80's albums of the band say this is when they sold-out,to me they hadn't sold out yet no because the music on the album even if it is not the Metallica we had grown used to,was still very good just more accessible.They still rocked at this point,their attitude was the same as before,the songs were great and they still had their long hair! Where \\"...And Justice For All\\" may have seem overly complicated \\"Metallica\\" used a more simple rock formula by making shorter and less aggressive songs.<br /><br />The black album as you may know is called that name because the print that read \\"Metallica\\" did not come out well on the front and the back of the album,that is an interesting fact about this album.The musical direction they took on this album was different than what they did previously,gone is the trash metal era,and in comes the more mainstream sound influenced largely by new producer Bob Rock.The musical change can be hear clearly,the songs are notably shorter and seem slower than on their previous releases.Now that doesn't mean the album is no good,actually because of that more and more people started listening to them.Some songs really stand out from this album and some songs can be considered among the best Metallica have ever done like \\"Sad But True\\" a slow,heavy song that is terrific or the superb ballad \\"The Unforgiven\\" which is lyrically one best song ever for the band (Metallica did slow intros for years but never had they really done a ballad).Also other notable songs are \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" and \\"Of Wolf And Man\\" some of my favorites here.\\"Nothing Else Matters\\" was a petty big hit and remains a stunning ballad after all these years.I've listened so many times already to \\"Enter Sandman\\" that I have grown tired of the song but its still a great song and the album's most famous track, a live staple. The lyrics are now much more personal and deeper than ever, James has grown as a person and as a musician even if you may not be fully ready to accept it. For instance \\"The God That Failed\\" is about James Hetfield's mother dying of cancer.<br /><br />At the time the Black Album was huge and it reached the 100 on billboards and managed to stay there for years.The tour supporting the album was huge and lasted for a pretty long time during which memorable events happened that is famous in Metallica history.The videos from the album were pretty successful as well and for a band that said years priors that said they never would make any videos they made a few for this album making them automatically commercial.Fans will know that the band had started to be commercial with their previous album \\"...And Justice For All\\" as they made the video for \\"One\\" when they said they would never do a video,thought nothing else about that album was commercial,but that was the seed of them becoming a more commercial band as great as that song was.They made something quite special with this album I believe,they made a commercial albums that both critics and Metallica fans could like and if you think about it its an impressive feat.<br /><br />Despite some of the criticism the black album gets,its still a great Metallica album,but its not a trash metal album like they used to which lead to bad rants from some of their fans,while it gained great commercial success.Unlike the previous album \\"...And Justice For All\\" you can hear Jason Newsted on Bass.The production of this one was incredible compared to theirprevious release which is a big step up on that point.Its not their best album but its still very good and highly enjoyable,it has plenty of great songs and it has such a rich history.Its one of the biggest albums in history and it took a over a year to make it. You need to have a different listening approach to the black album because it's not the trash albums the band did in the 80's, it's a little different and if you expect a trashy album you will be deceived. If you are new to Metallica this is probably not the best place to start,but overall its a solid mainstream release release for Metallica. 4 stars.is a big step up on that point.Its not their best album but its still very good and highly enjoyable,it has plenty of great songs and it has such a rich history.Its one of the biggest albums in history and it took a over a year to make it.

B002ZG98Z0|2.0|Let me just start by saying I am not a Sex and the City fan. I'm not against the show; I just never got into it. My mom got into the reruns, and I bought her the entire series on DVD for her birthday or Christmas or something. It's still in the box. Unopened. My first real exposure to SATC was when the first movie came out. I really enjoyed it and vowed I would watch the DVDs so I would understand what came before the movie. Um, haven't quite gotten around to it yet. So... here we go with SATC 2.<br /><br />SATC2 takes place two years after the first.  Carrie and Mr. Big are \\"between hot sex and a baby.\\" She wants to go out on the town, he wants to sit on the couch and watch TV. Miranda is having issues at the law firm. Charlotte is having a couple of nanny issues (you'll get that if you see the movie). Samantha is, well... Samantha: chasing the ever elusive fountain of  youth. So when she meets Shiek Mahmoud at a premiere and he invites her to one week in Abu Dhabi (which has a pretty happenin' nightlife), all expenses paid, the girls decide they're all ready for a week of decadence.<br /><br />Ah, Abu Dhabi. Even the flight over was decadent, the hotel suite was incredible, the karaoke bar was over the top. There was a lot of fallout in real life about the SATC girls throwing all that skirt-wearin' sexuality around Abu Dhabi , so those scenes were actually filmed in Morocco. The ladies quickly notice and are concerned about the native women who are covered head to toe with the veils and robes. This opens the discussion of how men in America don't really want women to have a voice.<br /><br />Of course, Samantha manages to majorly offend the natives in ways that are supposed to be funny but mainly come across as Ugly American. And who does Carrie just happen to bump into on the other side of the world? Her ex, Aiden. Hmm, what to do, what to do...<br /><br />SATC had its moments but it was not as funny as I had expected and hoped. As long as the movie was, it had no huge plot twists and, I was left wondering what the point was. I suppose it was about learning to appreciate what you have. I give this movie two out of five stars.<br /><br />The soundtrack includes the great \\"True Colors\\" by Cyndi Lauper and \\"Empire State of Mind\\" and a fun remake of \\"Rapture\\" by Alicia Keys. There's also a campy version of Beyonce's \\"Single Ladies\\" performed by Liza Minelli.ft wondering what the point was. I suppose it was about learning to appreciate what you have.

Domino isn't as flashy or modern or even innovative as some of my other books... but it's pretty good. A bit messy chic, like the mags or an Anthropologie store, but comforting and with easy to follow tips. I like it.
B002ZG994U|5.0|Okay, so check it out... I just checked out the new A-Team movie today, and I must say I was impressed...  The acting was great, and the voices from the movie characters sounded like the old tv show character voices from the past...as well as the characters playing very similar roles to the roles they played in the old tv show(meaning they didn't stray too much, if any from the old tv show persona's).                                The story line was well done... Kind of a prequel to the old tv show... a lot of movies are going that way these days...  The movie had plenty of action...a few things a little far-fetched, but remember this is the A-team were talking about... if you have ever seen the old tv show, you will understand...  The movie also had some funny parts... face was great, even though he was more on the serious side at times, then the former face(dirk benedict)  who was in the old tv show...  Murdock was goofy, but that is exactly how murdock should be...  Hannibal was perfect!  B.A. was pretty good too... though didn't have the same intensity as Mr. T...    Overall, I would say the movie was a success and will be popular... I'm guessing there will be a 2nd installment to the movie or maybe even a modern day tv show...  I just hope they don't wait 2 or more years to make another movie, like a lot of film companies do...    Go & see the movie, you will be entertained whether you saw the old show or not...    Thanks...

1416562605|5.0|First of all let me tell you that I was not aware of this book winning a man booker prize. So I did not have any expectations on this book. I finished this book in 2 days which is extraordinary in my own standard. I read about a 3-4 books a year and each book takes about 3 months for me. But the fact that i finished this book in two days(or nights) shows how good this book is.    As many reviews here already mentioned, this book is about the life story of a man called Balram from a underdeveloped part of India who rises like a phoenix from the shackles of the poverty to be a businessman.     As a Indian, I saw that author depicted and established the characters very well. He does try to add a little simplification of the villains in the story, but it gels so well with the story telling. I dont know what typecasting some other reviewers found in this books, but this books shows the characters behaving as naturally as they can.  You can feel the cruelty in situations rather than the characters themself.     I recommend this books for anyone who likes to get a highlevel idea of how pathetic the conditions of people is, in some parts of India and how those poor are exploited by the ruling class. This books also depicts the duality in india where one side is developing rapidly with multinationals coming in, and other side is being exploited by the government. Also shown is the corruption in Indian government setup. The book provides some comical entertainment as the main character writes the letter to Chinese Premier.    Overall, the books is certainly a great read. Deserves full five stars.
B001GCUO16|1.0|There are multiple origins for Wolverine. This is quite possible the worst. A forgetful cast, broken scenes (Logan gets smashed by a truck and tons of lumber fall on him BEFORE he gets the adamantium skeleton),  predictable (stupid) plots and horrible writing. Anyone who has read the X-Men from the 1970's through to the 90's knows how mixed up the story is in this film. Add some Matrix and anime fun into this movie and you get a mixed salad of garbage. All other features on the blu ray disc are very well done. Do yourself a favor and read some of the old books or watch X-Men 1 and 2 which were not as bad as this shipwreck. Wolverine is basically a few steps short of simply being superman. Not the Wolvie I grew up liking. Thumbs down.
B000C4A1EE|5.0|Honestly I had discovered helloween years back on one of the beavis and butt-head music videos with the song HALLOWEEN which got me into this band and I will never forget that and it made me want to write a letter to the great pumpkin instead of going trick or treating on halloween night. This album was the one that started the future of power metal and all these songs are pheniminal with the melodic heavy metal, My personal favorite was halloween which was the very first song I heard as a child.<br /><br />This is one of the best places for people who want to hear some real metal history!<br /><br />I highly recommended!<br /><br />\m/ stay metal \m/
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Stories of spies and corporate greed don't usually interest me.  I read the first book in this trilogy after a member of my book club raved about it. (Thank you, Trish.)  I loved it.  Story lines and characters were well developed and interesting.  Foreign books sometimes don't translate well, but these three had no problems with translation at all.<br /><br />I'd read a negative review before getting this last book in the series that made me nervous about investing in the hardcover as soon as it came out.  I HATE it when a book doesn't measure up in a series like this, especially when I've paid a lot for it.  In some cases, it becomes blatantly obvious that an author has pushed to finish a commitment rather than a good story.  In the end, however, I felt this book was the best of the three--and I liked the first two a lot. The reviewer's summation, as it turned out, was flawed rather than the book.  The review contained information that was factually incorrect.<br /><br />These books are not just episodic stories using the same characters.  Each one builds on the last.  The first two leave you wanting and needing additional information as should be expected of a trilogy.  More in-depth answers come with each book.  While each certainly stands on its own as a solid story, the second and third provide important information that make you more fully appreciate the first.<br /><br />I love the characters.  Throughout, Larsson uses these people to prove that what we might often view as flaws in individuals are in fact merely differences.  He creates an understanding that these \\"flaws\\" more often than not have positive influences not only for the individual, but for society as a whole.<br /><br />I'm glad I went ahead and purchased the book as soon as it came out.  It was well worth the price.
B002T9H2ME|3.0|NON-SPOILER: THIS FILM IS NOT ABOUT TIME TRAVEL, NOR DOES IT CONTAIN TIME-TRAVEL ELEMENTS.<br /><br />I bought this film (which I wasn't even aware of until recently), based on positive reviews from friends and reviewers. Though I liked \\"Moon\\", it's unlikely I'll ever watch it again.<br /><br />For at least the last 20 years, I've noticed an increasing affectlessness (lack of genuine emotion) in movies. Movies increasingly seem to be made by people who only know movies, who don't have any deep connection with \\"life\\".<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is arguably the poster boy for this sort of filmmaking. It isn't simply that most of his films have been \\"lightweight\\", but rather that too many of his films seem to be more about the subject of the film, or even its genre, than the characters in the story. (\\"War of the Worlds\\" is a particularly egregious example. The Classics Illustrated comic book actually conveyed more of the story's emotion.) And he's hardly the worst filmmaker in this regard.<br /><br />Directors and writers are more and more guilty of holding the characters \\"at arm's length\\". Filmmakers no longer seem much concerned with \\"connecting\\" with the audience. It's unfortunate that we have to watch /animated/ films (such as \\"Up!\\" or \\"Toy Story 3\\") to be moved in any deep way.<br /><br />This is the basic problem with \\"Moon\\". It has a far-fetched but not-bad premise -- which is revealed about a third of the way in, rather than coming as a lame surprise at the end -- but the writer and director don't do much with it. There is little attempt to get the audience deeply involved with Sam Bell's predicament, which is an existentialist one of \\"Who am I? Why am I here?\\". Perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to churn out an \\"in your face\\" story -- but they're being /paid/ to come up with something original. The result is that \\"Moon\\" doesn't ultimately engage the viewer on more than a superficial level.<br /><br />A good example of this failure occurs when GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) approaches Sam while he's trying to enter a password. Is GERTY going to help Sam, or block him -- perhaps even kill him? The director fails to build up any real ambiguity about the situation. This is particularly surprising, as Kevin Spacey was clearly chosen for this role for his ability to alternate between (apparently) sincere and unctuous/slimy.<br /><br />I might as well continue kicking this down dog by complaining about the lack of scientific accuracy. There is no radiant sound in a vacuum, and when Bell drops the coffee cup, it falls as if it were in a 1-g field, not the 1/6-g field of the Moon. (I don't know how much this would have cost to animate in CG, but I doubt it would have blown the budget.) The miniatures are, by modern standards, terrible, mostly because the people making them have no understanding of scale.<br /><br />The R rating is not for the brief shot of Sam's substantial and well-shaped gluteus maximus (which might be present for the obvious joke), but for a dozen unnecessary F bombs. There is no reason otherwise that your teenage kids shouldn't see this film.<br /><br />Your call. I would rent before buying.to enter a password.

Their stage presence is wonderful and they connect on so many different levels.  Highly recommended if you remember them so many years ago.
0060245867|4.0|There's a good amount of happy nostalgia associated with this book for me, so, the bad is that it makes it hard for me to review this objectively, but, the good is that obviously I loved it when I was little.  And, I can still see why!  The illustrations are adorable and the absurdity of the antics of this helpful little mouse are delightful!  I can appreciate now the 'helpful' actions of the mouse reflecting those of children who 'help' mom in the kitchen (i.e. cooking breakfast while leaving a huge mess behind) as well as the exhaustion that comes with taking care of something.  I also adore (now and when I was little) the scale of everything: the mouse in relation to the cookie, the tiny box for the mouse to sleep in, etc.  All in all, a whole lot of fun!
0061478784|4.0|Generally speaking, I love to ready Diana Wynne Jones's books. The characters come to life on the page, and it was a very entertaining read. The concept behind the castle was awesome, and so was Howl and Calcifier. If it wasn't for the fact I liked the characters and the writing style, I wouldn't have rated this so high.<br /><br />Some parts of the book kind of fell a little flat, but that might be because I've read it so many times. I really liked the storyline since it had a lot of action in it. I find this book to be more enjoyable than Harry Potter to be honest, but I have to admit that I love both book series.
185984054X|3.0|Missionary Position / 978-1-85984-054-2<br /><br />In the introduction to this book, the author preempts critics by asking the question \\"Is nothing sacred?\\" and answering, simply, \\"No\\". This is a good attitude when writing biographies and exposes, particularly ones of such powerful, influential, and traditionally immune from criticism as Mother Teresa.<br /><br />Unfortunately, at less than 100 pages and with a title that seems largely designed to provoke juvenile giggles than thoughtful reflection, \\"The Missionary Position\\" largely fails to deliver on its premise of serving as a scathing expose of Mother Teresa and, frankly, seems more like a paean to the wit and wisdom of the author than anything else.<br /><br />Which is a shame, because there's a lot of good information in here that deserves to be expanded upon. Hitchens points out the hypocrisy of hobnobbing and (implicitly or explicitly) lending the power of one's name to the corrupt and evil, even in the name of a good cause - and this is a very powerful question for debate. But amongst the criminals and dictators who can claim Mother Teresa's proximity in various photo shoots, Hitchens cannot help but take time to single out Hillary Clinton as equally unworthy of the dubious honor, due to her having \\"almost single-handedly destroyed a coalition on national health care that had taken a quarter of a century to build and mature.\\" Moments like these stand out as very \\"Cowboy Bebop at his computer\\" (if I may indulge in a TV Trope), because I'm not sure how to convey to Hitchens that reality was more complicated than that, and these outbursts make me doubt the veracity of the rest of the book - more's the pity.<br /><br />Each chapter is a little vignette of another type of questionable actions on the part of Mother Teresa - blunders with birth control, taking (and failing to return) stolen money, supporting corrupt politicians, exonerating businesses at fault for lost lives and property, refusal to use analgesics or pain-reducing medicine, secret (and unwilling) baptism of dying Hindus and Muslims, written appeals for clemency for criminal supporters - but each chapter feels like a short, crammed outline - imagine the 6 subjects I just listed (and more I didn't list) crammed into less than 100 pages, and you can do the math to see how exhaustively researched and documented this book isn't. Several of the space is, for that matter, devoted to basically complaining that the book wasn't already written by time Hitchens came along, pen in hand - a valid complaint for consideration, but like so many of Hitchens' digressions, it just ends up taking valuable space.<br /><br />If this book was a little longer, a little better organized, a little more exhaustive, and a little more clear on who the actual subject is (Mother Teresa or the author? - sometimes it's difficult to tell), then I would consider it worth owning in my library. As it is, the documentation is so spotty and each subject is treated so shallowly, that I'm not even sure it's worthwhile as a reference - the poor presentation diminishes the excellent intent.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollecret (and unwilling) baptism of dying Hindus and Muslims, written appeals for clemency for criminal supporters - but each chapter feels like a short, crammed outline - imagine the 6 subjects I just listed (and more I didn't list) crammed into less than 100 pages, and you can do the math to see how exhaustively researched and documented this book isn't.

0739474812|5.0|I bought this at a second-hand book store last year. It took me a few chapters to get into the author's writing style; I didn't realize it was a French/English setting and literary tone. I am glad I continued reading, though. The story is about a famous dying author who calls on a young biographer to relive the long-buried stories of her haunting, troubled past. Once I got well into the story, I could not put this down. I became fully engrossed in all of the characters, all of the gripping plots and turns, even the sordid relationship between Isabella and Charlie. The end was a little anti-climatic for me though. But even with the hard-to-get-into beginning and being a bit disappointing in the end, what was in between was intense, intriguing, suspensful and page-turning enough for me to still give it 5 stars. This was a very good find, and many modern goth novelists could take some notes on this book.
078322740X|5.0|Housesitter / 078322740X<br /><br />A cute and zany rom com, \\"Housesitter\\" explores the world of an uptight straight man, frustrated in his personal and work lives. When Magic Pixie Dream Girl Hawn sweeps into his life and creates a fantastic fictional backstory for their romantic \\"marriage\\" (and her own colorful pedigree), Martin's character starts to see the possibilities when he realizes after his initial resistance that his coworkers, friends, and family prefer his \\"new\\" persona that Hawn has created for him.<br /><br />Martin and Hawn work beautifully together here, in a classic comedy that still remains well-paced and very, very funny. As their characters begin to grow into their fictional personas, it is easy for the viewer to become caught up in the fantasy of reinventing yourself, perhaps into the person you always wanted to be but never dared to become.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

B000N4SHOE|5.0|Beatrix Potter was a woman born at the perfect time. She challenged the mores of the day and became a strong, independent woman, and successful author of children's books. She was a conservationist and realized the effects of man on the environment; particularly on the countryside she loved so much. \\"Miss Potter\\" is much more than a delightful story about a strong woman (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) and her romance with her publisher (Ewan McGregor).
1401923119|5.0|The Biology of Belief by Bruce Lipton was a great follow-up to Empathic Civilization (Rifkin), Blessed Unrest (Hawken) and The Chalice and the Blade (Eisler). These scientists are not afraid to investigate the tough questions and their answers. Their holistic perspectives help readers understand the big picture related to who we are, where we are, why we are here, and what might be some good strategies to keep civilization on a more harmonic path. Biology of Belief is cutting edge content for lay readers.

I had never heard it before purchasing 6 months or so ago.  Everytime I hear it I pick up something more of Clarke's genious.  if I had to be stranded on a desert island this is definitely one of the ten discs I would take with me.  BTW I have not heard the 8 song version so can't compare the mastering of this expanded disc against it.  But to me the disc sounds fine.  Only wish I could give this more than 5 stars.

Know he fancied himself as a poet first and singer second but this does not age well. Don't buy this set.
B0015OKWL2|2.0|Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are in one movie. You know, much awaited team-up of two legendary actors should be big news for many movie fans, and, actually, it was when Michael Mann made very intense thriller \\"Heat\\" back in 1995, even though they are together on screen only in one scene. (The two actors were both in \\"The Godfather Part II,\\" but they didn't share a scene.) Now I finally saw \\"Righteous Kill\\" starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino (credited that order), and though their acting is worth the price for DVD, the film itself turned out disappointing to me.    For \\"Righteous Kill\\" is not really successful as a thriller, or anything else. In this crime thriller directed by Jon Avnet (\\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" \\"88 Minutes\\"), Robert De Niro and Al Pacino play hot-tempered \\"Turk\\" and cool \\"Rooster\\" respectively, two veteran NYPD detectives. There is a vigilante-type serial killer at large, leaving a poem at the crime scenes. To investigate the murder cases Turk and Rooter have to work with Simon Perez (John Leguizamo) and Ted Riley (Donnie Wahlberg), a team of younger detectives, whom the veteran detectives seem to dislike.    From the very outset Jon Avnet's storytelling falters, partly because he fails to provide a viewpoint from which audiences can follow the plot in a logical way. \\"Righteous Kill\\" suffers from the muddled storyline, thinly developed characters (script by Russell Gewirtz of \\"Inside Man\\" fame), and its clumsily paced narrative. Yes, there are twists and turns along the way, but most audiences would lose interest by the time they reach the conclusion.    In addition to the two stars, obviously the best assets of the film, \\"Righteous Kill\\" has interesting cast including Curtis Jackson, Brian Dennehy, Carla Gugino, Trilby Glover and Melissa Leo. Sadly they are all wasted. After all this film is helmed by the director who did incredibly bad thriller \\"88 Minutes.\\" As to the much-anticipated team-up of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, I strongly recommendyou watch \\"Heat\\" again and forget anything about this one.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I wish there was a bigger font so I could write WOW in giant letters! I loved every minute of this movie. Yes, it was a tear jerker and yes, it was manipulative....but in the best possible ways. I thought the acting was good, the story inspiring....and it really did happen. That is the best part.
B001HN6940|5.0|If you don't expect the traditional story, this movie is a delight. Very well-acted, the story is interesting and moves along nicely, and the world that Burton creates is visually inventive, interesting, and at times stunning.  Burton can be way too quirky, but here, he swings for and achieves his home run.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Disney movies and this one didn't disappoint. It's a cute movie full of catchy jazz music. Almost any kid will love it, but girls may like it more. Using the old story as a spring board worked well and I really like seeing the traditional 2-D animation. Overall I think this one will be another Disney classic.

6305291446|4.0|The last decade or so has not been the highlight of the Halloween series. Resurrection was a disaster, and so were Rob Zombie's interpretations of the first 2 films. They were all cluttered with typical, unimaginative slash-em-up fanfare with no creativity behind them. Considering Michael has been terrorizing Haddonfield since 1978, it's not surprising that the series is losing steam by now. However, H20 is by far the best of the recent Halloween flicks, and one of the best in the series.<br /><br />The plot is simple: Laurie Strode is 20 years older, has a successful career, a son, and a love interest. But there's just one problem--the memories of her uncle on that fateful night (which spanned 1 and 2) still haunt her. She has resorted to an alcohol problem and pigeonholing her 17-year-old son, latching onto the hope that it would help her cope. Everyone around her tells her to move on, but lo and behold, Myers is back! After stealing information on the whereabouts of his niece, he's goes on the prowl to finish what he started 20 years ago. John Carpenter creates his vision of the Myers trilogy very well. The \\"Thorn\\" trilogy, as it's called, is ignored with H20; Carpenter wasn't too happy with how Myers was portrayed in 4-6 (4, in my opinion and many others', is the best sequel of the series, actually. 5 is pretty good and underrated, but I'll side with Carpenter on Part 6!). It brings everything full circle, and the head-on collision between Myers and Laurie is very intense and enjoyable. Watching them wage a battle on each other alone throughout the school contains some of the most memorable moments the series has to offer. The cast is great. Jamie Lee Curtis does as great of a job as ever. She continues the story of Laurie in a way that is logical and fits within her characterization. LL Cool J plays the lovable security guard who is an aspiring romantic writer. The teen actors and actresses are all perfectly likable, and behave how teens do in this day and age. This is also the only movie of the series to provide a sense of closure. Some fans will hate it, some will love it.<br /><br />But not everything is perfect. The movie lacks suspense where it otherwise could have had it. The epic orchestration is fitting in some parts of the movie, but totally unnecessary in others. Had it been cut out in some scenes, there could have been much more tension and more of a horror vibe. It almost pains me because it truly does ruin some scenes. Michael's mask shows too much of the skin around his eyes, making him appear more human, which further lessens the tension. The mask in the early films was far more effective. Also, H20 takes awhile to get the ball rolling. I understand the need to develop the characters, but there's a noticeable lack of Michael in the first segment of the film, and it makes the film drag. I liked the ending, and I applaud Carpenter's attempt to conjure a sense of resolution, but it feels somewhat anti-climactic. It's not quite as earth-shattering as it should have and had the right to have been. It's quite unexpected, and there's a good chance that it might make you jump, but more could have been done with such a monumental moment.<br /><br />As far as sequels go, however, H20 works pretty damn well, and provides a highly entertaining experience. Carpenter is one of horror's finest directors, and H20 is almost worthy of joining the ranks of his trilogy masterpiece (Halloween, The Fog, The Thing). There is only so much one can do with an idea that's been used over and over for 20 years (32 as of writing this review), but Carpenter makes us of all of it and more to create one of the best installments in the Halloween saga.also the only movie of the series to provide a sense of closure.

I read the entire book to my husband over several days of long car trips and he even went out for a run today. I laughed, I cried and I hated putting it down.
B000BQV52A|5.0|I just recieved this magnificent box set today 14/6/2010 and I was stunned by the music,the performance and the sound quality.  This is the 1968 amadeo/decca of the complete sonatas and the 1971-3 concertos.  In my personal opinion Gulda is the best pianist I've ever heard.  I was about to get kempff for his reputation but when I purchased the complete piano and cello Beethoven works of gulda and fournier I was struck by gulda's performance.
B00003CXAA|3.0|This trio of movies represent the best trilogy ever made and I'd include the Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones (to keep its honour intact I'm going to ignore the last outing) and any other trilogy that's currently out there.  The trilogy is a classic in describing the descent into corruption of innocence and how slippery a slope it is.  It starts out as a way to defend the family and then spirals out of control so that excuses are constantly made up less and less compelling than before to justify the continued involvement in it until after all the destroyed lives years later comes the realisation that the deception is complete.  This whole set is simply a masterpiece in story-telling and Francis Ford Coppola is the master of the genre.<br /><br />The movies come well packaged in 4 digipak holders that fit into a neat slipcase the fourth disc containing bonus materials the pick of which is a behind the scenes documentary.  The sound quality is average coming with surround sound options although the picture quality isn't perfect which is understandable given the age of the masters but it improves gradually as you get to the second and third movies.  That said the imperfections are plentiful coming in the form of black, white spots and in some scenes white slashes and while not so bad as to detract too much from the viewing experience but they do become obvious enough to comment about and so overall this is an average quality standard dvd format version of the movies.  It'll be interesting to see how much better the Blu-ray version is and whether or not they managed to clean up the picture quality even more; I'll have an update on that once I receive it and have a chance to view it hopefully within the next month or so.<br /><br />Movie-making of the highest order!<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Updated 31 Jan 2012:<br /><br />As Amazon will not allow me to review the blu ray version of this separately, I've decided to append this here.  The Blu Ray release is a disappointment because the picture quality is only slightly improved over the dvd version with still lots of grain in too many frames and either the master film has deteriorated so badly that this is the best that they could do or the restoration work was pretty poorly done.  Having watched lots of 1080p discs and even standard dvds that have been upscaled that look lots better than any of the 3 films here it's safe to say that I'll wait for a much, much better restoration job to be done hopefully in the near future.  All-time classic films like the first two films here deserve a whole lot better than this blu ray alleged \\"restoration\\".  Till then, I recommend you wait for a much better picture and even sound quality release i.e. at least DTS HD MA 5.1 instead of this average Dolby 5.1 version.y release is a disappointment because the picture quality is only slightly improved over the dvd version with still lots of grain in too many frames and either the master film has deteriorated so badly that this is the best that they could do or the restoration work was pretty poorly done.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|Errol Flynn was at the peak of his acting and athletic abilities when Jack L. Warner chose this film as his studio's first technicolor production. There have been quite a few attempts over the past seventy-two years or so to remake the Robin Hood legend on film and television; even Errol Flynn's turn as the dashing rogue of Sherwood Forest was a remake of Douglas Fairbanks Sr.'s original 1923 silent epic. That said, in my view, no one has since equaled the spirit and zest of this 1938 tour-de-force brought to the screen by not only Flynn, but Alan Hale Sr. reprising his 1923 role as Little John, Basil Rathbone's (hiss! booo!) totally reprehensible Sir Guy of Gisbourne (aka the Sheriff of Nottingham), Claude Rains (yecchhh! ugh!) as slimy and devious Prince John, Eugene Palette playing that supreme gastronome Friar Tuck, and, of course, gorgeous Olivia de Havilland as Maid Marion, Robin's love interest. Enjoy the movie. They just don't make 'em this way any more.
B002N8A14M|4.0|I don't have much to add since these two reviews are very comprehensive and totally on the mark.    Just to elaborate on the plug issue-- no really, this is an issue. I was like \\"Oh, the plug to my headphones doesn't look that big; I'm sure it will work fine.\\" Oh, how silly of me. My sports earbuds fit into the ipod fine when the case is on; however, my fancy noise canceling don't-bother-me headphones I use at work do not, which is very, very frustrating.     If you use cheapie earbuds/headphones, this won't be much of a problem, as you can always just buy a different pair of cheapie headphones that will work; however, if you are an antisocial snob like me, I wouldn't recommend buying this if your nano is your primary listening device.    I was going to give 3 stars because of this issue, but I bumped it to 4 because this is by far the best armband/clip I have ever used (refer to Ms. Understood's review) with any of my ipods (and I've gone through a lot). As I just got a new ipod (free with new macbook), I use the nano primarily for running now, so now it's less of an issue for me.
B002ZG995E|5.0|Don't listen to the critics and haters, this is one GREAT MOVIE!!  From start to finish this movie is jam packed with action and humor like no other!  Murdock is hilarious and often steals the scenes he is in.  Take the whole family over 7 years old and enjoy the action!!

B001GCUO5M|5.0|I think that some of the mixed things I'd heard about it come from the fact that some audiences were a) expecting something different and b) don't like to think. To be fair the studio mislead them by selling Shutter Island as a fun, edge of your seat, thrill ride.  It's really a psychological drama disguised as a B grade horror movie. It indulges in all the gothic tropes: the isolated mental hospital, the hurricane that cuts everything off from civilization, hints of Nazi experiments, even the music plays into it. But really that's just the setting. If you take it as the whole thing, that's where you'll run into disappointment. It's more about what's happening in the mind of the main character- which is a puzzle in itself- than the big twist ending.  I think that The Sixth Sense and others of it's ilk did a disservice to audiences in a sense. People look for the \\"trick\\" in movies, studios advertise the \\"big twist ending\\". But this isn't a movie about a twist. Yes, there's a big reveal in the end, and  the \\"what\\" of the reveal is fairly obvious. It's the \\"how\\" and the \\"why\\" that we should be thinking about. These are the answers to the psychological puzzle of the film. People get so into the \\"what\\" after being groomed on twist endings that they forget there is a \\"how\\" and a \\"why\\". When the big reveal comes it's more about the catharsis, the coming full circle, the emotional confrontation, than the twist itself.      Yes, it can be confusing not to know whether the main character is dreaming or hallucinating, or really seeing what is. But with patience that becomes clear and the beautifully photographed, eerily haunting dream sequences are worth watching without trying to \\"figure them out\\".  Just enjoy the performances (impressive across the board), the score, the cinematography, and go where the film takes you. Some might call the ending a cop out. But really it leaves audiences with even more questions: are there some things that are so painful that we're better off(literally) cutting them out of our brains? Is a delusional mind a prison or an escape? Who is sane? Is sanity a choice? In my opinion answering these questions would be the cop out!
B003NTSBTC|5.0|I loved this movie, suspenseful. I did not have a clue until the movie let us know what the mystery was.
1439153663|5.0|I loved this book.  If you liked \\"The Help\\" you will like this one.  It is about a little Irish girl who is orphaned on the voyage to America, ends up on a southern plantation, and is caught between the two worlds of the slave help and the white plantation family.  Her naivete to discern between these two worlds and the situation she has grown up in lead to great suffering and tragedy later in her life.  The story is told from her point of view and the young slave woman who works in the 'kitchen house'.  It was a great read.  I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend it.
B001IB63KQ|5.0|It's so rare for a band to sound better live than on a studio recording; but this one does. I had heard a few of the live cuts on pandora and saw a few of the clips from this DVD on youtube so I bought it. I was not disappointed. Each member of the band is a talented musician and Hayley, wow. If you like modern rock/alt rock bands, get this. This \\"CD\\" includes the concert DVD on a separate disc; a fact not patently clear from the Amazon description (at least when I bought it).
037571457X|3.0|In Persepolis, Marjane Satrapi uses the graphic novel format to share her life story with readers.  Satrapi grew up in Iran during the years that the Shah lost power and the Fundamentalist Muslims became the government authority.<br /><br />Satrapi was raised in a modern family that valued education and modern life.  Her parents were part of the revolution that forced the Shah from power.  They were shocked, however, when the ultra-religous government that took over soon made the freedoms they were used to and expected illegal.  No longer could women dress as they pleased; they were instead forced to wear the veil.  No longer could the Iranian people travel freely; the borders were closed for over three years, and even when reopened, passports were almost impossible to obtain.  No longer could one count on an education; the universities were closed for over two years.<br /><br />Darker items were to follow.  There were 3000 political prisoners under the Shah, but there were 300,000 political prisoners under the new regime.  Satrapi's family had both relatives and friends that were imprisoned, tortured and some were even executed.  Then the government got involved in a war with Iraqi.  Bombings were common, and over a million people were killed.<br /><br />Satrapi's use of the graphic format is a perfect match to the story of a young girl whose life changes so dramatically and who tries to make sense of the things happening around her with a child's understanding.  Satrapi ended up being educated outside of Iran in her teen years and later, and chose a graphic artist's career.  This book was a perfect match for her talent, and her memoir is chilling.  To see freedoms taken away gradually is difficult, and when one looks up and sees where the normality markers have moved to, it is eye-opening.  This book is recommended to all readers who care about world events, and those who enjoy memoirs.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This movie was beautifully done!  I would definitely order again.  I love period movies and since this was based on a true story, it made it even better.  Beautiful shots and costumes and something I felt comfortable watching with my younger sisters as a movie night because of the rating.
193413712X|5.0|George Washington Crosby is dying.  He has been brought home to die, and spends his last days in a hospital bed in his living room, surrounded by his family and friends.  He rarely interacts with them; instead he spends his time in a nether state, where he roams through the memories and events that make up his life.<br /><br />In particular, George's story is that of men and their fathers.  George's father, Howard, was a tinker; someone who drove from one isolated farm to another, selling the supplies that the farmers could not produce on their own.  He was a gentle man and often taken advantage of by those around him.  Howard's defining characteristic was that he was an epileptic.  His seizures were severe and scared his children while disgusting his wife.  When he discovers that his wife plans to have him committed to a mental hospital (this was in the 1870's), he leaves the family without a word and builds another life elsewhere.<br /><br />George has spent time rasing a family.  After his children are grown and he is retired, he becomes a master clock repairer and seller.  As he lies in his bed, his thoughts often drift to his clock business; the preciseness that is needed to repair them, and the knowledge that a clock in working order ticks off the seconds and minutes and hours of a life, giving the ability to lead a structured, regulated existence.<br /><br />Paul Harding won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for fiction for Tinkers.  It is an amazing feat, as this is his debut novel.  The book demonstrates the human longing for connection, but also the fact that each of us leads a separate life and die alone, whether we are physically surrounded by others or segregated into an isolated place.  This book is recommended for all readers.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|This was different than I expected...kind of a strange beginning and generally more light-hearted than other Jane Austin movies.  If you are a true Jane Austin fan I think you will enjoy it because it does seem to follow the book more closely than shorter versions.  It does seem to move slower in comparison to Pride and Prejudice which I think is partly due to the diversity of characters and that they are not as intertwined as other Austin classics.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|the headset is nice and the speakers are great. I'm giving it a 4/5 because the clip broke within a few hours. Felt like it was made of cheap material. Plus when their is no sound coming through you can hear static.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|The acting, the special effects, the makeup and costume and the socially relevant story line make this a must see for everyone. My husband and I were rivited, at the edge of our seats the whole movie. I only wish we had seen it in the theater. Why it didn't win Best Picture is beyond me.<br />The story line forces us to look at what we have become in our avarice and single minded need for MORE We have become the Bad Guys. Planet destroyers and killers. It may be being said too often. But it must be said in as many ways as it takes, until it is heard. In this case the movie is an exciting visually appealing carrier of that message. In other words you are entertained while being taught. And treated to a deeply moving spirtual connection with all of creation.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|I know this is a harsh review but I have to put it this way because the whole watch does not fit in design.    I love the dial and the design of it,it goes perfect and looks stilish. The only thing that just doesnt fit to the eye is the strip... The strip that comes attached to the watch is way too small{not wide} for it. It just takes the whole idea of the watch to the floor. The strip is good looking and it would have turned out as a perfect watch if it was made wider.    I know im being harsh but the whole idea of the watch its that it ooks great in the whole picture. Nice looking Dial with a poor looking strip = 3 stars
1423113381|4.0|This book was exciting, adventerous, filled with suspense and I ultimately loved it, however here are a few minor critiques...  1. The two main characters Sadie and Carter are running for their lives from egyptian monsters and gods priveously thought to be deceased or myth. They find help from strangers who somehow know everthing about thier past, but refuse to tell them anything leaving them in the dark about who they really are for nearly half the book, problem is it also leaves the reader in the dark and what was supposed to come off as suspence very quickly just becomes annoying.  2. While I am far more familiar with Greek History it was easy to keep up with who's who of the various God's and monsters in the Olympian Series. I am not so with Egyptian myths and ledgends so it made it difficult to keep all the characters straight in this book. Plus all of the monsters are hybrids of at least three different creatures which makes them hard to picture.  pg 256: you could almost mistake it for a huge greyhound except for the tail and the head. The tail was reptialian, forked at the end with triangular points, like squid tentacles...the creature's head was the strangest part, they stuck straight up like rabbit ears but were shapped more like ice cream cones... the snout was long and curved like an anteater's - only anteaters don't have razor-sharp teeth. It's eyes were glowing.   Carter does us all a favor and nicknames this creature Leroy.  So ultimately I recommend reading this book quickly so details don't become far between, and have your computer near by so you can look up name pronounciation and even creature pictures. But then again if you are more familiar with Egyptian Mythology than I (which wouldn't be difficult) you shouldn't have a problem as Rick Riordan is still a fantastic author.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|I won't spoil this for those that have yet to watch.  It's really an old storyline which we've seen in so many movies in the past.  Get it if you want a feel good movie.
B00353RUPC|5.0|I cant stop listening to this cd. I dont know what they did, but the sound quality of this cd is so amazing. it has to be played really loud to enjoy the crisp sound texture. My favorite track on there is I Wanna Life. I cant stop listening to that track. Believer is my second favorite. I feel like each cd Goldfrapp puts out, they get better and better. Its great to see a band like this grow forward and not sound like what is already out there.

B000SGGUWS|5.0|this book is a superiorly trashy good time! im fairly certain eveyone reading it as well as the series understands it is fiction. sometimes there doesnt need to be lessons in ethics or morals and if you look to fiction to provide them then there is something lacking in your life. this book &its followers are a guilty pleasure and escape from reality. while the girls may be shallow and petty and never learn, they do suffer consequences. i am 35 and love the series (just finished book 5) and am looking forward to the tv show. keep reading!     and i apologize for poor structure. this is my first time using the keyboard on my kindle.
1423101472|3.0|This review is really for the whole Percy Jackson series. The series was entertaining enough to hold my interest through all five books, but at every turn there was something straight out of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. Percy Jackson is a somewhat troubled and confused teenager who soon discovers that his best friend is a satyr (part goat) and one of his teachers is a centaur. There is a whole Greek mythology-based world lurking just below the surface that he soon gets thrown into. Each book in the series moves the overall story arc closer to the big showdown battle for good or evil, which is really the bulk of the fifth book. The comparisons to Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are undeniable and unavoidable, from the overall structure of each book, to the most minute details (there was an invisibility hat instead of a cloak, and scorpions very similar to blast-ended-skrewts cropped up in the fourth book). After five books, the amount of details that seemed to be pulled straight from the Rowling and Tolkien series began to be more than just distractions. By the last chapter of the last book, I was more than ready for it to just be over already. Win the war, get the girl, yeah, yeah, we've heard it all before. There was enough action and interesting characters to keep fans of Greek mythology and teenage fantasy interested. While there are a lot of powerful female characters in this series, I would expect boys to like the series better. And while I found the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings stories to be very appealing to adults, I think this series is best left for the youngsters. Or it you're an adult, just go into it with low expectations. Not a bad series, but there are better ones out there.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|So much of television is such crap and when I first came across the airing of \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" it immediately caught my attention.  I of course, wanted more!  Imagine a show that doesn't have bad language, and is for the most part a pretty wholesome show to watch.  Season two has so much suspense and action and it really would be a shame for it to end there.  This is the best fantasy program I have watched in years and watching it over again just adds to the joy of good entertainment.    I'm sorry, but there are so many TV shows that cause me to 'turn off' the television, why can't they air one that makes me want to watch TV again?

0446563048|5.0|When Tony Hsieh, CEO of [...], Inc., tested his entrepreneurial genes with a worm business in his youth, he soon embraced Thomas Edison's philosophy, \\"I failed my way to success.\\" Hsieh failed pretty good. At age 24, he sold LinkExchange to Microsoft for $265 million.  Then as CEO of 10-year-old Zappos, he negotiated a stock exchange in 2009 between Amazon and Zappos valued at over $1.2 billion. But (and this will shock you), it was never about the money. Tony and his team of 700 still run Zappos.<br /><br />Zappos is an online retailer of shoes, clothing, bags and handbags, housewares and other products. They provide free shipping (both ways, in  case your shoes don't fit) and a 365-day return policy. Their niche is customer service, customer service, customer service.<br /><br />So what can you learn from Tony and his team? Tons!<br /><br />As CEO of LinkExchange and after hitting the snooze button for the seventh time one morning, it dawned on him: he dreaded going to work. The energy, the passion, the fun was gone. \\"It was more like death by a thousand paper cuts, or like the Chinese water torture\\" Tony writes. \\"Drop by drop, day by day, any single drop or bad hire was bearable and not that big a deal. But in the aggregate it was torture.\\" After he sold the company, he had this epiphany: \\"I didn't realize it at the time, but it was a turning point for me in my life. I had decided to stop chasing the money, and start chasing the passion.\\"<br /><br />So, with his new venture capital fund, he invested in Zappos--a struggling online shoe store, and ultimately became its CEO (long story, frequent close-to-the-edge turmoil).  There he discerned that building a culture was foundational to building a brand. One customer, duly impressed with receiving an order sooner than promised suggested they start Zappos Airlines.<br /><br />He invested in his people.  They built a resource library in the lobby with over 100 business and management books. \\"Many of the books would eventually become required reading for our employees to help them pursue growth and learning, and Zappos would even offer classes to go over some of the more popular books.\\" (Three cheers for the Book Bucket!)<br /><br />To ensure that \\"we continued to hire only people who would fit into the Zappos culture,\\" they asked employees to meet with prospective new hires and describe the uniqueness of the work/family environment.  Eventually, they put it in writing and self-published their own Culture Book, editing only the typos--thus allowing employees to tell it like it is.  Zappos is big on transparency. For a free copy of the Culture Book, just email the company and include your physical mailing address. (Three cheers for the Culture Bucket.)<br /><br />In my book, Mastering The Management Buckets: 20 Critical Competencies for Leading Your Business or Non-profit, and my Management Buckets workshops, I recommend you limit your core values to five or less, because team members can't remember (or live out) more than five. Zappos may be my only exception. Their 10 core values are driven deep into the company's DNA. \\"Over time, our recruiting department developed interview questions for each and every one of our core values, and we test our commitment during the hiring process.\\" Their core value, \\"Be Humble,\\" affects their hiring decisions the most. (Sounds like a company I could work at.)<br /><br />The Zappos mission is \\"To live and deliver WOW.\\" Their 10 core values include: Deliver WOW Through Service, Embrace and Drive Change, Pursue Growth and Learning, Build Open and Honest Relationships With Communication, Do More With Less, and five more. The book includes a color commentary for each core value, written by various team members.<br /><br />There's no stuffiness here. Instead, the practical examples and lessons learned jump off the page. \\"Over the years, the number one driver of our growth at Zappos has been repeat customers and word of mouth.\\"  What about social mediaand integration marketing? \\"As...low-tech as it may sound, our belief is that the telephone is one of the best branding devices out there.\\"<br /><br />Whether you're a new attorney, a new accountant or a new customer loyalty team member at Zappos, your first month is invested in a four-week orientation course, including two full weeks of taking customer service calls.  Yet at anytime during that orientation period, Zappos has a standing offer to give you $2,000 (plus your regular pay) to quit on the spot. That's brilliant!<br /><br />Zappos invests in three key areas: customer service, culture, and employee training and development (be sure to read about their Pipeline team). They quote Jim Collins who says, \\"If you have more than three priorities then you don't have any.\\"<br /><br /> \\"Jenn,\\" who explains their Culture Book, describes the sum total as the \\"gestalt of Zappos.\\" She adds, \\"By sprinkling in images of what the Zappos family does from morning to night--Marshmallow Peeps® contests, happy hours, Zolidays, the annual vendor party--we give readers a true sense of the brand in a non-obtrusive way.

B001IF5YLQ|4.0|I bought this adapter after first buying one of the cheeper generic brands versions of these. When that stopped working after one day, i decided that i was going to have to pay the $30 for this product. When i got it, i noticed that it's better constructed and much sturdier. It works the same as the cheeper brand did, only now after nearly a month of use, the apple adapter still works. If this product were $20 it would be a much better deal. 4 stars instead of 5 for the price alone.

B002ZG997C|3.0|A post-apocalyptic action film with Denzel Washington as the hero and Gary Oldman as the villain, with Mila Kunis along for the requisite femme fatale role, and Tom Waits thrown in for good measure?  THE BOOK OF ELI had all the requirements to be a first-rate film, a stand-out in the genre.  Unfortunately, it isn't.  True, it has an interesting premise: a man (Eli) is traveling across the country, carrying the last remaining Bible (not really a spoiler; you kind of know it long before it's \\"revealed\\").  Simultaneously, an evil man named Carnegie (groan) is devouring all the books he gets, looking for that one...that holy one.  And when he meets Eli, and finds his book, he wants it.  Oh, he wants it.  The only thing he didn't plan on, though, is how much a** Eli can kick.<br /><br />I will give the film this much: it never quite drops the bottom out on you.  And the action is stylized; it's nice to see Denzel kicking butt and taking names.  And Oldman shines in an otherwise cliched role.  Mila Kunis should probably stick to comedy (remember MAX PAYNE?  Me neither), and it's kind of unsettling, having her be the sole attractive woman in the world.  The film has its flaws, far too many of them--most of it hinges on the script, which is just pathetic at times.  The overt Christian overtones are surprisingly pleasing; they help the film stand out, even if you're not into that kind of thing (and I'm not).  Overall, ELI is a film to see if you're a fan of the genre.  If you're not, you probably won't like it.  It's not as good as its cast and premise would have you believe, but at least it's better than a lot of what else gets handed off as action films these days.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Though not quite be amongst Scorsese's very best (like Goodfellas!) in my opinion it is in the next tier down and comparable to ones like \\"The Departed\\" (and unlike that, this isn't a remake so far as I know...).        As the movie begins the primary protagonist (played by DiCaprio) is an outside investigator en route to \\"Shutter Island\\" (used by the government entirely as a mental institute) to investigate the disappearance of one of the inmates...even though escape from the cells is supposedly impossible!  As the movie proceeds the main character notices certain things seem off  and that he does not seem to be getting the full story by the institutions' authority figures. Dicaprio's character is also unstable and suffers flashbacks of his experiences in WWII as well as other experiences....   As the plot deepens it takes on one of a good mystery...the protagonist and the audience clearly know there's some secret behind \\"shutter island, but we don't know what it is.      This does have the feel of being a bit of a \\"throwback\\" to previous movie eras- it's set in the fifties and is just a good-old fashioned mystery/suspense/thriller not tied to current events or overtly to politics.  Also, in an age we seem to be in of movies with ambiguous endings - either for the sake of not having a good ending or setting up a sequel - this movie has a definite good old \\"beginning,\\" \\"middle,\\" and \\"end.\\"  In other words the audience is given answers...even though there may be aspects left for the audience to determine the meaning of.  The movie did start to drag slightly at the latter parts, and I was ready to just get to the ending already.  Also, although the movie reminded me of a couple other older movies, it had a different \\"twists\\" from those.      Some have implied this is \\"weaker\\" Scorsese...I would not describe it as that, though it may not be the type of movie that he will ultimately be remembered for.  He may have wanted to dabble in the suspense/thriller genre....and Ithink we're lucky he did!  After all I think some of his historical movies like \\"Gangs of New York\\" and \\"The Aviator\\" dipped at least slightly in quality in comparison to earlier ones.  This probably puts him somewhat into the Spielberg camp- making important drams, but also a few adventure movies along the way like this....    If nothing else, this movie is a entertaining departure by Scorsese and makes for a good \\"take a break and go to the movies\\" movie!
0618918248|5.0|Although it is clear that Mr. Dawkins was molested by a priest as a child, I loved this book.  He does a wonderful job of putting human religions in their places as far as I am concerned.  Where I do not agree with him is when he claims that the odds of there being a god is minuscule.  As far as I know (and everybody else knows for that matter) the odds are 50/50.  Either there is a god or there is not.  Just because we have no proof what-so-ever, it does not mean that there is no god.  Please don't mistake 'religion' for 'god', it drives me crazy.  God could exist in a form we cannot even imagine with our human brains.      That's my two cents.
B002ZTQVGQ|3.0|My soon to be 4 yr old was enjoying the movie before the alchemist father appeared in a frightening scene, so I turned it off, but my son now has nightmares about it.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|This is an above average thriller that takes place on a forbidding, windswept island facility for  the insane, including criminals, and it is set in the 1950s.  DiCaprio is a federal marshal who comes to the island to help find a supposedly escaped prisoner.  I can't say much more without spoiling it, but suffice to say that he gives a great performance, as do Ben Kingsley and Mark Ruffalo, as he continues his investigation and uncovers many secrets  --some of which he had hidden away in his own mind, regarding his tragic past and the life he used to have with his family.    There are some very disturbing images throughout the films:  dead, frozen bodies in a concentration camp; other dead people; horrible conditions in the ward for the most dangerous prisoners, etc.  Be warned. This might not be for you if you are easily upset or prone to nightmares.    Otherwise, enjoy!
B002ZG994U|4.0|When a group of war veterans are framed for a crime they didn't commit, they are out to clear their names and out for revenge as well! That isn't exactly the show since the A-Team just wanted to clear their names, they never killed anyone. Even when a truck went flying off a cliff in the show the bad guys would get out and just dust themselves off.<br /><br />  The movie is a big non-stop action mess, but it's so silly that it's entertaining. What makes it better than a big mess like Transformers 2 though, is that it's great fun if you've seen the show. I mean Transformers 3 might as well be called the Adventures of Sam Witwicky. Here the characters from the show are at least alive again and so are some of their antics that we grew up with and loved. So in another words, the A-Team aren't side characters for a horny teen who's in love with a hot girl in tight clothes.<br /><br />  When there's not brainless action, Sharlto Copley does get to have some fun being a nut, playing Howling Mad Murdock. While he has chemistry with Rampage Jackson, who plays B.A. They argue as much as they do in the show, but until Murdock cooks for B.A to calm him down. I don't think anything calmed down B.A in the show, but I found that humorous as well.<br /><br />  While Bradley Cooper's Face, is more of a nut than Dirk Benedict's though. Dirk's Face hated to be punched in the face because it was his meal ticket, here Cooper even begs a guy to hit him. Cooper still has moments where his Face gets to flirt with woman though to get what he wants.<br /><br />  Hannibal Smith isn't really done justice though. Liam Neeson hams it up as best as he can with big cigars and a sadistic smile, but no one could replace the late great George Peppard. Peppard brought so much energy to the show, that it's hard to believe that he died only 6 or 7 years after it was canceled. I did at least laugh in the film when Hannibal needed a disguise to walk through an airport.... he went as Liam Neeson lol. Well not literally, but he had the usual Liam Neeson look in that scene and in the scene that followed, he was back to Hannibals gray hair. So it's little things like that I found funny.<br /><br />  When I heard Patrick Wilson was playing Lynch, I expected the serious Colonel from the show that was always in pursuit of the A-Team. But here, one of the silliest things is that a lot of guys have the name Lynch. So even though Wilson's Lynch is practically Michael Bay and likes blowing stuff up, doesn't mean he's supposed to be the Lynch from the show. But anyway, now that is cleared up, Patrick Wilson is surprisingly a lot of fun and livens up the brainless action scenes with funny one-liners, like \\"damn, that reminds me of playing Call of Duty\\".not literally, but he had the usual Liam Neeson look in that scene and in the scene that followed, he was back to Hannibals gray hair.

1593081529|5.0|Jane Austen's Emma was published in December 1815, when she was forty years old (just 19 months before she died).  It is thus a work of her mature period, and is something of a favorite among her devotees.<br /><br />My admiration of Austen's work is partly for her insight into human nature but also for the sheer beauty of her prose.  It has a poetic texture.  Her sentences can be long and complex, with some confusion of pronouns, so that they need to be lingered on, their sense teased out of them, until their structure and meaning is revealed, exactly as one would do with poetry.  The effect is immensely satisfying.<br /><br />She spends almost no time on descriptions of place, but when she does she shows herself capable of describing a scene succinctly and effectively.  Her main focus is on character.  She describes her characters and their motivation at length, and reveals them through dialogue.  This emphasis on dialogue makes her work eminently suitable for dramatization, so it is no surprise that there have been so many adaptations of her work in cinema and television<br /><br />Emma is unique among Austen's novels in that the heroine is a spoilt rich girl, with definite character flaws.  The reader is challenged to judge her and to choose to like her or not.<br /><br />One or two of the plot elements are somewhat contrived, but that befits a comedy of errors, which is what this essentially is.<br /><br />I would advise reading as little as possible about the book before reading the book itself, for fear of spoilers.  In particular, you should avoid any introduction, because editors of classics very generously provide complete synopses of plots in their introductions, presumably to spare the reader any surprises.  Introductions are best read after the story or, in the case of the Barnes & Noble Classics edition, not at all.  The introduction by Steven Marcus is verbose, meandering and thoroughly confused.  If you want good editorial input, choose another edition.<br />[PeterReeve]
0385504225|5.0|I've just finished reading this, and as with The DaVinci Code, I didn't want it to end! I thought it was extremely thought-provoking, it sparked my interest in noetic science and the Masons, and it made me eager to take a trip to Washington, D.C. and wander about with this book in hand. It was a great read. I don't know why others are so negative about it. I thoroughly enjoyed it. What sets Dan Brown's novels apart from others is his meticulous and thorough research. To me, that is the mark of a great writer. If I could, I would give it more than 5 stars!
B00000ILDF|5.0|I will admit that after seeing this movie in the theatres i was very dissapointed. I, like the rest of the moviegoing planet, had wanted Hicks, Newt, and Ripley to become a family and battle aliens together. I hated Alien 3 because they killed that hope. I watched it again about 2 weeks ago and i see now why they went in the direction they did. The Alien franchise is not a traditional sci fi franchise. The characters and enviroments that make up the franchise feel real. There are no flashy, outlandish, sets or stupid matching uniforms that make up a corny storline, much like star wars and star trek. There isnt this giant unrealistic void in which the director tries to put the viewer in. Despite the entire saga taking place in space, the enviroment is very down to earth if you catch my drift.<br /><br />Back to Alien 3. I realized that it is a masterpiece of a film. Fincher didnt carry on the previous characters because he is not a hollywood director. He knows that had he made hicks, newt, and ripley one family it would have been a cheesy stupid lovefest of a crapfilm. He killed the characters to make his own film. Fury 161 is a prison planet that is dark and dank. Full of tunnels, \\"F channels\\", a creepily realistic aboitiour, and a gothic assembly hall. If your looking for flashy effects and cheap one trick ponies accompanied by lets-get-this-over-with acting you are better off watching star wars. This enviroment feels real and the musical score is brilliant. The score is something in itself. It contributes masterfully to the enviroment. You feel what the characters are feeling and you can almost smell the planet.<br /><br />Now on the characters. They were mostly British yes, and they all had shaved heads. Did this detract? No. it added another interesting element to them. They looked the same yet all had depth to them. \\"Double Y Chromo Boys\\" inhabit this world. Charles Dance, Pete Postilate, and Peter Guinness all give terrific performances. Needless to say acting has never been a problem in the Alien Saga and this film is no exception.<br /><br />I like Alien 3. I would go as far as to say it is on par with the first and second. It is different and the average moviegoer will most likely hate it, but if you have an appreciation for a genuine script, interesting characters, and a unique enviroment I highly suggest this film.n a problem in the Alien Saga and this film is no exception.

0810988232|2.0|The artwork is just as beautiful as ever but...the whole thing does not quite deliver. Unlike magical Fairy Oracle, full of subtext, subtle meanings and fairy charm (which does not mean there are no dark corners and hidden depths), this deck is flat. The Fairies are presented as very definite figures, bearing exactly that one meaning as described in the book. In my experience that is never the case and least of all with Fairies.  Moreover some of the Fairies do not seem to quite belong to others which adds disharmonic accord to the whole deck.  In short - if you love Brian Froud´s artwork, it is worth buying. If you love Fairy Oracle, prepare yourself to be potentialy disapointed. Although - one never knows, what does not work for some might be just the thing for others.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|District 9 is a superb film. that fact makes it unlikeable by the mainstream moviegoer. We are so used to crappy scripts and bad acting glossed over by dazzling CGI that we have forgotten what movies are supposed to be. We are introduced to the prawn. Not a very likeable creature. they crawl in garbage, rip people's limbs off, abuse alcohol and cat food, and are generally unpleasant to look at. But we come to understand these prawns. We understand their plight, and while we dont fully support their actions we no longer look at them with the same contempt. the bad guys in this film are not really bad guys. Humans are not depicted as evil and neither are the aliens. Both have faults and both function much like intelligent thinking organisms function.Their is no attempt at indoctrination by this film. We are not presented with this overly biased political agenda that is bashing us over the head with its simplicity, much like Avatar was.When you take a side in this film you have good reason to. You are not an evil corporate thug if you take the side of the humans. This is how avatar should have been made.

Theo who is 13 has built up a reputation of knowing \\"law things\\".  Both his parents and his uncle are lawyers, so Theo knows just about everybody in the legal system in his town.  There is a murder trial going on and Theo stumbles across some evidence that can change the trial - then ethics take over.  A very enjoyable read for all ages.

B0019N8P2W|3.0|After years of waiting, for one of the best shows MTV ever will produce, I received my complete animated series of daria. The container is sturdy enough to survive the USPS, but I really was disappointed with the DVD's. Not the content, daria is pure gold, the DVD'S are obviously the cheapest quality that can be made. I have bought DVD+R in packs of one hundred at Pay Day for ten denars that were a better quality. For $49.00 semoliens, you'd think that MTV would have sprung for a higher quality disc for their programming.  By all means purchase daria, just be very careful when touching the DVD's.

I ordered this movie as a gift      I did read all the information in amazon web page when I selected this movie and I do not remember to see the seller comment about selling the movie with a blank DVD case.     I think that this product should not be listed as a new movie. When I contact the seller about returning this product I did not get any answers.    This has been the worst experience with Amazon    Gonzalo
B000F5GNX8|5.0|I haven't laughed so much at a movie with so many dead bodies in it in... well never. This is a smart, funny movie, which shouldn't be a surprise considering that the writer of Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout wrote it. Witty dialog and serious scenes that have a humorus twist make this a fun movie.     RDJ and Val Kilmer have great chemistry, they're obviously enjoying themselves and they give great performances. This is one movie I'd love a sequel to, or maybe just the actors teaming up again in another movie. They're a great pair.     The commentary is as much fun as the movie, they're not always commenting on the movie so much as having fun, but there is  a lot of insight to the film and behind the scenes goodies.    Any RDJ fan should already have this movie in their collection. If not, then why not?
0393072231|4.0|I really enjoyed \\"The Big Short\\". For me what made it a great read was the combination of a very entertaining narrative with understandable descriptions of complex financial topics. The \\"entertainment\\" is ensured by the fascinating character portrayals of the protagonists, and even more so by the descriptions between the protagonists and the \\"mainstream\\" players in the financial industry. Particularly scathing are those involving the credit rating agencies and their staff.    But also hugely valuable is that I was able to learn quite a bit from the book. I had only vague ideas what CDOs are, how mortagage bonds are put together, and critically, how credit default swaps operate.  Lewis made learning about this stuff both interesting and easy, which I think establishes him as a phenomenal talent in business writing.

817224164X|5.0|In Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler reveals himself as the embodiment of three of the worst and most destructive theories of he 20th century:  Social Darwinism, ultra-nationalism, and racism, most maliciously expressed in anti-Semitism based upon a fantasticly constructed international conspiracy of Jews to rule the world. Though not the exlusive purveyor of these intellectually vacuous and dangerous ideologies by any means, he is the man who was able to put these theories into practice.  The cost as history documents was sixty million lives in WWII, including most horrifically the murders of six million innocent Jews in the genocide of the Holocaust.    Social Darwinism was the perversion by analogy of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution transposed onto the human condition.  It had greater currency than some scholars will admit during the time Hitler wrote Mein Kampf. \\"Survival of the fittest\\" (a phrase Darwin never used) as Hitler espoused it eventually was used to justify conquest, slavery, and death for weaker or more peaceful peoples. Mercy for the less fortunate was \\"unnatural\\".  Adding a touch of Malthus, Hitler justified conquest of other countries as a Malthusian imperative to obtain \\"Lebensraum\\"-soil for an ever-growing German peasant population.     Ultra-nationalism and racism also justified the conquest of \\"lesser\\" people, like the Slavs of Russia and the   Balkans.  They justified a new march to a second war with the French, in his view Germany's greatest natural enemy, next to the Jews of international finance. The recurring theme throughout Mein Kampf is Hitler's relentless obsession of the position and assimilation of the Jewish population into German society.  Never concerned with facts or proof, Hitler attributes any misfortune that befell the German people, from the loss of WWI, to hyper-inflation, to unduly burdensome war reparations, to criticism of his ridiculous theories to \\"the Jew\\" and Jewish involvement with international finance and purported control of the press.    How could a man with such vapid intelligence obtain such great power?  Read Hitler's chapters on the use of propaganda and the tactical approach to his formation of his storm troopers and you will see.  Tbey demonstrate a street-wise cunning that negated his second-rate intellect.  Nothing in the book, however, can replicate the charismatic nature of his speaking ability and its ability to stir the latent brutish forces that created world havoc from 1939-1945.    Tbe high rating that I have given the book is based upon its historical value as a look into the mind of a political psychopath. It should be read to understand that reason and the intellect are necessities in the course of human relations, not revenge, racism, and emotion.  Had Hitler not been able to translate his words into deeds, Mein Kampf would never have seen a second printing. It would have been consigned to the dust bin of history, as has Hitler's precious Third Reich.
0307454541|2.0|I was mildly entertained, and it was a page turner.  I kept turning the page, eager for something to make it a worthwhile read... didn't really find what I was hoping for.  The other bad reviews are accurate critiques of the book.  My biggest complaint was that I'd rather not read about sexual violence.  Original Swedish title is better fit.
B00009L1UP|3.0|I believe Empire is Queensryche's sell out album (or if not, it *should* be because of how commercial it sounds).      Simply put, this songwriting is *bland*.  I'll give Queensryche some deserving credit in that their style of heavy metal is a significant improvement over the predictable party rock styles of bands such as Motley Crue and Quiet Riot, but this is definitely not in the same league as Metallica or Iron Maiden either. No way.    Every time I listen to a Queensryche album I get the same impression that they think they're writing the most important music ever, but completely miss the mark because the songwriting is always weak in at least ONE area.  Sure, the band has their moments, but more often than not they either throw in a verse melody or a chorus at the worst possible spots and completely mess up the flow of the song.  I get this impression a LOT while listening to Queensryche's music.      Of course the 80's version of this band is better than Empire, but not by much.  Oh well, at least Empire is better than Metallica's sellout album released around the same time.  Whereas Empire feels like a disappointment compared to previous Queensryche albums, that Metallica album is just an overrated generic mess.    Anyway, let's discuss some of the songs.  \\"Best I Can\\" has a really cheesy chorus and lyrics that make me blush a little, but the verse melody is really spectacular so the song at least has THAT going for it.  I swear that's actually David Bowie singing on \\"The Thin Line\\".  Of course if it really was David Bowie, I'm sure he would have enhanced the vocal melody by reaching for something inside his huge bag of creative tricks.  He certainly wouldn't have believed something THIS bland would've been considered acceptable and worthy of putting onto an official album.     It boggles my mind how \\"Jet City Woman\\" ever became such a gigantic hit back in the early 90's (and still receiving radio play to this day on some stations).  It has one of the worstverse melodies I've honestly ever heard, and the chorus is loud and obnoxious in the same way any given Bon Jovi song is.  The album *does* eventually improve however.  \\"Another Rainy Night (Without You)\\" is a really good ballad.  Everything about it, including the chugging guitar riff during the intro to the verse melody to the chorus is absolutely terrific.  Great song.      The title song is spectacular as well for its memorable and hypnotic-sounding chorus.  This is a rare example of Queensryche being able to put together a tune that's great from beginning to end while maintaining the heavy metal spirit.  It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it's a great experience.    \\"Silent Lucidity\\" starts off REALLY beautifully before the strings come in and turn the entire song into a bloated, unsatisfying mess.  Songs like these make me think it's unhealthy to take a band like this THAT seriously.  It's not a bad song, but it's quite sappy and overrated.  I just wish the rest of the tune lived up to that fantastic intro.    \\"Hand on Heart\\" features a return to the Bon Jovi vocals so obnoxiously displayed, you could have sworn the 80's never left.  Then the album improves again with \\"One and Only\\".  This is the kind of song that contains a strong vocal melody, not forgettable and predictably written ones... which is exactly the problem with the closer \\"Anybody Listening?\\"  Unfortunately *I'm* listening but I wish I wasn't.  This song plods along endlessly and bores me the entire time.    Queensryche's not a bad band.  I like half of Empire.  I just don't think these guys are the greatest thing since sliced bread.
B002V9PEUE|3.0|I saw this in the theatres way back in 1993. I for one was suitably impressed by the trailer that promises epic action on the scale (no pun intended!) of 'Die Hard in the snowy mountains' with Stallone. With high expectations, I got what I want: R-rated action. Bloody of violent bloody and gratuitous cussing scenes. They don't really make this sort of high budget movies nowadays.<br /><br />Renny Harlin is actually quite an adept in being an action movie director. His slo-mo scenes do reeked of John Woo's ballistic ballets, but no as gracefully done. In terms of all balls-out action, he's your man. Stallone practically sleeps walk through this role and adds nothing significant to action cinema, other than surviving 30 feet drops off cliffs.<br /><br />All that is said and done, the picture quality of this Blu-Ray is excellent. So clear in fact, one could have fun nitpicking the horrible blue screen / green screen whatever it is that they were using in those days. One could tell that the planes were fake. The mid-air explosion is obviously superimposed. Stunt guys were easily identified and the helicopter at the end is obviously a model. The DTS-HD audio surpasses all previous home video editions, one could listen to the horrid Trevor Jones' 'melancholic' theme to this movie with extreme clarity. I still feel that age was not kind to this movie. Thanks to Blu-Ray, all special effects and audio deficiencies are out for the jury to judge.
0060555661|5.0|The classic book on value investing, and for good reason.  For someone who wants an overview of the philosophy and principles behind value investing, this is an excellent choice.  The information is thorough and the argument is persuasive.  My fear is that it is too persuasive: after reading it, people might be tempted to think they can make money using the investment strategy explained by the book.  Read it for the tremendous knowledge to be found in it, but don't be fooled - most intelligent investors are better off investing in index funds.

B000VSAEYI|5.0|My two year old daughter loves this pool! Like others have commented, the slide does not work so hot, but she still loves to climb up and down it and attempt to slide. It is also a good size for mommy to hang out in and the slide makes for a great lounging spot! When hooking up the hose, the sprinkler system around the pool can really get some height on it. We usually turn the hose on very low and just let the water shoot up a little as opposed to full strength. It takes about 10 minutes to inflate with the pump from our air mattress, but we don't even use the pump to deflate. Once you remove the plugs, it comes down pretty quickly and folds up great. Overall for the price, it has been great purchase. I foresee an entire summer of fun with this pool.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|One of my favorite titles of all time.  I've been waiting for this one for a while.  It comes with multiple versions of the movie and it's interesting to see what each cut has to offer.  The movie still looks great after all these years.
B00003CXA6|3.0|I couldn't wait to see this movie, because I am SUCH a fan of the Pulitzer Prize winning book \\"The Killer Angels.\\" GREAT BOOK! The movie, while not nearly so great, is amazing in its scope and the sense of scale it gives to the story.<br /><br />Ted Turner set out to bring the book to the screen, and the best decisions were to invite thousands of Civil War re-enactors to be extras in the film, and to film on location at Gettysburg. Nothing like thousands of people passionate to get it right, especially when you put them at the site of the actual battle.<br /><br />Jeff Daniels is excellent in his role, as is Richard Jordan. Tom Berenger does a very good job portraying General Longstreet. Unfortunately, this is probably Martin Sheen's worst acting ever. I'm sure Robert E. Lee rolled over in his grave every time Sheen appeared on screen.<br /><br />Despite my criticism of some acting and the fact that it really doesn't do the book justice in explaining the Southern point of view regarding the war, this film delivers some really fine perspective on this pivotal battle. Crank the surround sound during the battle scenes, and you can appreciate the courage it took to charge against all odds.
B001FB55H6|5.0|I watched this movie in the theater and now I own it on bluray.  The movie was transferred well.
B003CIG7AE|3.0|This is my first exposure to this band, and while I wouldn't exactly include this at the top of my list of favorites, it was a pleasant album to listen to.  In this era of highly engineered, over mastered, commercial music, this is a bit of a throwback to an earlier style of music.  Depending on the song, you can hear many influences from great performers like the Eagles and Crosby, Stills & Nash, and even (dare I say it) the Beatles.  And yet, the band clearly has found its own unique voice, distinct from all of those influences.  This isn't exactly a party album, but it is relaxing music, perfect for a quiet afternoon.
0545101417|5.0|This series has definitely kept me at the edge of my seat. I can't wait for the third book. The audio discs were of excellent quality. I think the narrator has a little older voice than I think the main character would have, but she does an excellent job narrating the story. I would definitely recommend this series to anyone over 12+ (due to violent content).

B000QCS8TW|2.0|There is already a ton of praise for this book so it's unlikely my opinion will sway anyone from reading Game of Thrones, but I didn't like this book. It's been a while since I've read it, but essentially my problems boiled down to 2 things:<br /><br />1) Wikipedia defines the fantasy genre as such: \\"Fantasy is a genre that uses magic and other supernatural  forms as a primary element of plot, theme, and/or setting.\\"  There is almost zero magic in this world. So little, in fact, that I would consider this simply a period piece. A medieval drama if you will. This book is _barely_ fantasy. A more accurate description would just be \\"period piece fiction.\\"<br /><br />2) Too many characters written from their own perspective. I didn't enjoy reading half of the stories going on, and it made it so that I had to slog through several different storylines that didn't interest me in order to get to the ones I did enjoy. Also, it's very difficult to identify with (m)any of the characters, and much of what makes fantasy fun is being able to \\"live through\\" the main character. That never happens in this book. Strangely enough, many of the positive reviews cite this as a strength, but I definitely would add this as a weakness. Call me crazy, but I _like_ the classic formula of 'boy grows up to save the world' when it's done well. However, I'm open to original ideas as well, which is why I tried this book. But it just doesn't work for me. I'm still looking forward to see what HBO does with this series though.
0446563048|5.0|It's Jerry from the Facilities team.  I'm one of the guys that helps everything around BC function well and look great. Because first impressions are very important to me, I'm always looking for new ways to create memorable experiences that keep people coming back, so I want to share a book about an organization that has really inspired me to reach new levels of service and enjoyment at work.    I was recently given a pre-release copy of Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose by Tony Hsieh. If you aren't familiar with Tony, he is CEO of [...], which is an online shoe retailer that sold over $1 billion in products last year. Zappos is known for having amazing customer service such as unexpected overnight shipping upgrades as well as creating an incredible work environment for their employees and vendor community. This is a team that knows how to have fun at work. Their culture is truly magnetic and they prove this by offering to pay new employees to leave the company, yet very few ever leave.    From the beginning, I knew this wouldn't be your normal book about business. Instead, It reads more like a really good drama as Tony explains the birth and growth of Zappos and how culture became their most important asset. There are several cliffhangers in which the future of the company depends on a well-timed miracle. It really is surprising that Zappos survived despite the perilous journey they endured.    Over the course of this journey, Tony and his team discover that culture is important for creating passionate employees, passionate employees lead to extraordinary customer service, and extraordinary customer service makes for fabulous marketing. When people are free to be themselves and empowered to do whatever it takes, they feel valued and they pass that on through their work and play. By creating core values that everyone can believe in, people tend to live out those values which become contagious through all of the employee's interactions. Every day is a new adventure where everyone enjoys being a part of something larger than personal agendas. Zappos became profitable by realizing that happiness is more important than money.    This book is also filled with incredible wisdom on business. It includes everything from transparent staff communication to creating an interview process that draws great people and a set of core values that sticks. However, I saw something much deeper than that, I saw how important the happiness of other people is to making each of us feel more successful.    You may be asking why this book review is in a church blog. I believe happiness is something that we all need to pay attention to if we desire true relational capital. If I focus on creating positive experiences for everyone around me, I have greater impact on the rest of the world. One of the most effective investments we can make is in the happiness of other people.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This story portrayed is true and unnerving.  Might recommend the book as a companion to the movie to make the facts and story more realistic.  Book is titled,  \\"Nothing is Strange With You, the Life and Crimes of Gordon Stewart Northcott,\\" By James Jeffrey Paul.  Poor little Walter and Christine his mother were only 2 Victims of this horrid serial killer.  Gordon Stewart Northcott was a very complex man and a true psychopath.  His mother, Louise Northcott was no less. The book is hard to read for the soul and difficult at best, but chapter 5 is solely about Walter Collins, the little boy that the movie, Changling was portraying. Unbelievable what the system did to this woman at the time.  But, the whole fact and the whole story is indeed stranger then just the part. If you got into the movie, the book is a must read.
1595825045|5.0|As soon as I heard that the \\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\\" art book was being released I went and ordered it immediately. I had high expectaions for the book and I was not disappointed at all because the book actually exceeded them. They not only give you thorough insight on their creative processes, from brainstorming to storyboarding to final execution, but they also tell about the challenging road they traveled on to create, pitch and get the show aired. Being an aspiring animator, this was a major plus. Not many animators in the business mention those aspects.<br /><br />Before I read this book I was on somewhat of a inspiration hiatus. After reading how Mike and Bryan gained success by sticking to what they believe in, plus seeing everyones hard work (meaning the artwork and animation processes) that was put in the show, the inspiration came back to me.<br /><br />I highly recommend not only looking at the pictures but actually reading the book too. And I of course highly recommend the book to any artists, animators, illustrators and fans of the Avatar series.<br /><br />An amazing book with a surprisingly low price.<br /><br />- N. Bowman
0307463745|5.0|REWORK tells how to succeed in business through a different path than other business books. It shows how business plans can be harmful, why outside investors aren't always a good idea, and why you need less to start a successful business than you think. It entirely 'reworks' the idea of successful business pursuits, offering an alternative to the usual business guide that builds its foundation on a business plan. An easy-going, inspirational approach makes REWORK a top pick.
B0038KHTGC|3.0|This and Angel Of Babylon is really is a double album released in two parts no doubt to reap the best financial rewards, so I'll mention both in this review and post ALMOST the same review for the other album too.  I can't see any point in reviewing the two albums separately, especially when they are part of the same concept.  If others disagree, then go for it separately but I'm gonna do it this way.<br /><br />Having really liked the last Avantasia album Scarecrow quite a lot I was pretty keen to get my hands on these two, especially when I saw the wicked covers and the pre-release clip on You-Tube of the song Dying For An Angel with Klaus Meine of the Scorpions sharing vocal duties.  This song is pretty commercial but has a great, catchy melody and rocks hard enough to appeal to my taste and with Klaus Meine's superb voice I was instantly won over.  But man it's a real shame that besides this song, I really haven't found much that really appeals to me... on either album!!!<br /><br />I don't ever really get into the whole concept thing too much, even when my favorite bands release \\"concept albums\\".  I just listen primarily for the enjoyment of each song on its own, and if the songs don't cut the mustard I won't give the album much airplay, no matter how clever or interesting the concept is.  Even then if I do like the album, I rarely have the time these days to delve into the whole concept thing and still prefer to enjoy the songs on their own just as individual songs.  So as far as the whole concept behind these two albums which make up parts two and three of a concept started on Scarecrow, I'm stuffed if I know and don't really care to be honest.<br /><br />Of the two albums, The Wicked Symphony is the better in my opinion, but only slightly.  Besides the song mentioned earlier, others on this album that I don't mind are:<br />Runaway Train which is quite tame, a bit long, but still very melodic and enjoyable.<br />The Edge which is another tame one that closes the album, but still with a great melody.<br />Blizzard On A Broken Mirror rocks a bit more and is ok without being great, and the same can be said for Forever Is A Long Time and The Wicked Symphony (although this drags on too much too).  All in all I think that you are much better to make your own single compilation album from the best songs from both.<br /><br />There is no doubt Tobias Sammet is a very driven, talented and creative musician and you can't criticize his output, but to me these albums are just too tedious to really enjoy.  Scarecrow had a whole albums worth of good songs which were quite different in style to his usual gig with Edguy, going for a metal-opera type sound over hard rock/metal.  But in my opinion he has gone too far with these two albums in his attempt to be heavy metal's answer to Andrew Lloyd Webber, or maybe he aspires to be a metal Meatloaf?<br /><br />Whatever the case, the songs on these two albums are just too much.  The compositions in many cases are way too long and have too many changes within them, both of musical direction and vocalists.  With as much talent gathered together as there is on these albums you would expect something special but for me it's a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth.  Not that they try to outdo each other, but instead I think that generally it's more a case of hearing them chip in here and there so frequently doesn't give any of them a chance to really shine.  So the end result is quite a letdown.  The songs go all over the place and some of them are just way too long, which makes listening to even one of these albums all the way through quite a challenging and tedious experience.  Unfortunately I'm rarely in the mood or have the time for albums like this and instead will go for Scarecrow if I want to play Tobias Sammet's Avantasia.<br /><br />Ratings:<br />The Wicked Symphony - 3 stars<br />Angel Of Babylon - 2.5 starsat melody.

0446563048|5.0|I've been a big fan of Zappos for the past three years, have blogged about them several times and often make reference to the great work that they do in my presentations. So I was thrilled when I received an advanced copy from the publishers. I have to admit my expectations were high and Tony did not fail to WOW me. Given Zappos' reputation this should not surprise. But what did surprise me was the truly inspirational story of bravery and human endeavour behind Tony's and Zappos' success.     To be honest I had in my mind a picture of Tony being the kind of \\"lucky\\" person who whatever he touches turns to gold. After all, this is a guy who three years out of college sold his start up internet advertising business LinkExchange to Microsoft in for $265 million, and then in 2009 sold Zappos to Amazon for an incredible $1.2 billion. Talk about being an \\"Outlier\\"! What I hadn't however, known until reading the book, were the incredible risks, hard work and sacrifices that Tony made. Like any entrepreneur it took sheer guts, determination and perseverance, a willingness to loose it all in order to win and above all a great passion to fight for what he believed in.     I'm going to reread the book and this time with a pen and highlighter as there are insights and nuggets of brilliance on every page.     I highly recommend this book to anyone in business who is passionate about making a difference to the lives of their customers and the people they work with. It's a must read for 2010!!
193413712X|5.0|I first heard about Tinkers on the PBS Newshour when it had just won the Pulitzer. The description of the publisher--a tiny medical/science press that only puts out 2 or 3 works of fiction a year--and the fact that Paul Harding was an alumnus of the Iowa Writers' Workshop was intriguing, and Paul's description of being in Marilynne Robinson's class compelled me to pick up the book the next day.<br /><br />Tinkers is the kind of book that I endlessly fantasize about writing. The language is precise and gorgeous, the story dense. I can only take it in in tiny bits, like a piece of rich cake, and I can savor every bite no matter its size. When I read a book like this, I talk to it out loud, so moved by every tight, lovely sentences, every description of nature, of the internal workings of clocks, epilepsy, old age, fierce, violent weather, encroaching death. Had you been in the same room with me as I made my way through the almost 200 pages, you would have heard nonverbal noises of affirmation, surprise, want, adoration, recognition. I would gasp, say \\"Jesus\\" in wonder, in surprise and awe, and sometimes I would just close my eyes and press the open pages against my forehead. The protagonist suffers from seizures, and after one has passed through his body, \\"confusion prevailed; Howard's blistered brain crackled and sparked blue... it was as if... [he], by accident of birth, tasted the raw stuff of the cosmos.\\"<br /><br />The story is a relatively simple one--an old man is dying, and in his mind travels back to his New England childhood and the people and places who remain there--but it is done with such grace, such beauty, such pain and precision, it's almost unbelievable.<br /><br />Marilynne Robinson calls Tinkers \\"remarkable\\", and it is. If you're a fan of her work--Housekeeping, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Gilead, its sequel, Home--and savor beautiful prose, Tinkers will undo you.
B001EO748M|5.0|Every Episode is a cliffhanger. I think that makes the series \\"The Tudors\\" so great. I know that most re-creations of History to Film usually insert things that are not factually accurate. However, with \\"The Tudors\\", as with the series \\"Rome\\", what is added only makes for a fantastic viewing experience leaving the viewer wanting more. I am an avid historian and I know the fact from the fiction yet I rate this so high because of the flow between the two and the anticipation that it leaves me with in waiting for the next episode or season.

B000JJSJR8|2.0|Martin Scorsese directs this movie about Las Vegas set in the 1970's and 80's.  The mob is in control and then goes out of control.  The whole story makes you want to take a shower and find a safe place.<br /><br />\\"Casino\\" is a story of Las Vegas glamorous past and fairy tale exterior.  The mob runs rampant beneath the glitz and glitter as we see the stark contrast of blood money and the beautiful people who own beautiful things.  \\"Casino\\" shows the rise of a casino owner with mob connections (Robert De Niro), his friend and Mafia underboss (Joe Pesci) and in ex-prostitute with a strong will and expensive taste (Sharon Stone).<br /><br />Based on a true story, overall it is just too much of everything, blood, gore, gangsters and drugs.
0345477618|3.0|The paperback version of this book that I first bought (not from Amazon) turned out to be a version that was practically text-only, and also lacked some sections of text. Illustrations were only in a few photo pages inserted among the low-quality text paper. Quite disappointing, since I expected what can be seen through \\"look inside\\" on Amazon. Apparently, this is the British paperback version, and according to Jonathan Rinzler (himself?) in a comment (which was written before I changed this review), the American paperback is nothing like this. Well, I don't really know, I'm just saying: be careful about which edition you choose! I recommend the hardback.    I originally gave this a \\"1\\" rating, based on the terrible paperback, but since I realized Amazon does not separate between editions in ratings (and also it might not be the edition actually on sale here) I changed it.

B002M2T1UO|5.0|About everybody who has reviewed this series loves the show. There was some issue about the original packaging on the seven series booklet. Speciically the disks came in a greating looking book two inch thick book covering all seven seasons, and the disks were in slots in the very thick heavy duty cardboard pages.  Anway, that problem has been solved with some sleaves that cover the disks when they go in and out to prevent scratching.  So now a great product with no problem regarding disk scratching. Now great packaging.     This show is addictive. I can't stop watching. Five stars.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|If you liked Daria when it was first on, you'll love this DVD!  Every episode is as good as the next, and I'm getting to see all the ones I missed.

B000HF6XPY|3.0|A world is in great danger by threat of an evil power, and the only people can save it is a 10-year-old Latino [[ASIN:B0000696HW surf ninja]], a glutton New Yorker, and an Austrian and a Danish who both can barely speak English.  Hopefully, what I just typed has made an image in your head to realize just how stupid \\"Red Sonja\\" really is, but it became entertaining because of it.  Nothing got me into a grander time than watching Brigitte Nielson deliver such hammy and forced dialogue like \\"Gedren...QUEEN Gedren\\" or \\"Someone needs TO get a little spanking\\".  Schwarzenegger as Conan---I mean Kalidor---was a pretty hammy character too, but this is Ahnold we're talking about.  It's amazing that the best actor of the whole movie is that 10-year-old child named Tarn who existence, alongside his glutton guard Falkon, is being annoying comic-relifs.  Because action films [[ASIN:B00000JQB5 really]] [[ASIN:B000OT6V64 needs]] [[ASIN:B002IPFWTE annoying]] [[ASIN:B000BT98XK comic reliefs]].<br /><br />What I didn't enjoy for the wrong reasons were mainly the design and pacing.  Because it's made in the '80s, Red Sonja has to look incredibly tacky: her ugly hair, flimsy costume, and practically her overall posture makes her appear totally unflattering.  As for the pacing, there's a lot of extended padding that went on in the movie: one scene had the villainess Queen Gedren walk slowly from her cult chamber to her throne in a couple of shots, and early on, the bad guys had to depart from a conquered religious palace while a slow-moving mechanism in the middle of the room arduously closes itself.  Seems to me it's all been manipulated from the director to achieve a feature-length time.<br /><br />The fights are awkwardly choreography, but then that's part of the fun.  Watching Red Sonja wobbly swings her weapon, the bad guys making incompetently silly choices, people wearing godawful attire, and how Ahnold is constantly taking attention from the movie, it's fantasy goofiness.  I did actually enjoy the music score by Ennio Morricone, even if does use the same battle theme ad nauseum, and the epic atmosphere was still there.  If you want a competent fantasy tale from the early lore, this is not worth your time.  Time like this should be spend for those who lavish in the poor quality; it's cheesy, but it's cheesy entertainment.y the music score by Ennio Morricone, even if does use the same battle theme ad nauseum, and the epic atmosphere was still there.

0316017922|1.0|The author lacks any credibility that prevented me from making it past the first chapter. He went to great lengths to lay the foundation that your date of birth can actually influence your level of success should your chosen career be professional hockey. According to the author, 40% of outstanding Canadian Junior hockey players were born between January and March, and 70% were born between January and June. Also according to the author, this outlining statistic carries out clear up to the NHL. Makes logically sense since the Junior leagues feed the NHL.    I found this statistic rather fascinating but doubtful, so I did a little bit of research. Within 30 minutes I was able to copy and paste every NHL roster into a spreadsheet, then quickly determine that the author has no credibility. Only 56% of NHL players were born between January and June, not the whooping 70% that the author claims. While it could be argued that 56% is statistically significant since by chance the number should be closer to 50%, it's hardly the slam dunk that requires no further statistical analysis...that a blind man could see as the author claims.    When someone can't get an easily verifiable statistic like the one above correct, what else is being fabricated?
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This has become one of my very favorites and is now in my collection.  Matthew Macfadyen is one of my favorites and his performance in Little Dorrit is one of his best next to his performance in Pride & Prejudice. I think the pick of actors for this story was exceptional. This is a movie of intrigue, suspense and a great love story. Once you start watching it you have a hard time to not continue until you find out how it ends. I highly recommend it. I don't like all of Charles Dickens stories but this one I think is his best.

B003ELOQD4|4.0|I have seen many reviews regarding the quick switch of the taping..each shot lasting only a few seconds. I can understand one's fustration over this style of editing. I have viewed the past two U2 releases...'Vertigo 2005' and The Elevation Tour from Boston, both filmed by Hamish Hamilton, whose editing is quite annoying. But with the new 'Rose Bowl' video, I was pleasantly surprised. The editing wasn't as bad as the previous videos listed, the sound is very good, and my only complaint is the editing of their now famous intro and the performance of 'Breathe'. Aside from this, the dvd is actually very good, with the exception of the ending of 'Moment of Surrender' and we should be watching U2 taking their bows and walking off stage. Instead, we are transported back into the spaceship and the credits roll.<br /><br />If you want to see a great opening, I mean 'Space Oddity' playing from the very beginning, as you hear a fan state....'Here we go'...go to YouTube...type in U2 Dallas..then scroll down until you see U2 Dallas-10/12/2009-Intro & Breathe. The length is 10:24. Trust me, this is a very good version of the intro and song. Watch this first, then right after, start the dvd.<br /><br />Get well soon Bono!!
0307341577|5.0|How can there only be one review for this book?  Dark Places is an amazingly deep and fully realized story.  It is suspenseful and feels completely real.  I hate it when people give away the stories in their reviews... I don't want to know the story, I just want to know if it is a good book.  I can read the synopsis of the book myself.  So, my review is short and sweet... this is a fabulous book.  A great and creepy novel.  Complicated characters we have never before met.  A story we don't already know the ending for.  Gillian Flynn writes a gritty, no-holds-barred thriller like no other female writer I've ever read.  I'd love to know the woman who can make these stories come alive with such conviction.

It is the kind of book that I had to force myself to put down so that I could go to sleep, and that I immediately picked up again upon waking.  It is the kind of book that demanded that I sit down and read and read and read until I finally discovered what had become of the characters.  It is vividly and masterfully written, the kind of book that is guaranteed to stick with me for quite some time, the kind of book I am sure to read again and again.    Though I had been aware of the book's popularity before I read it, I didn't really know anything about the premise--and I'm actually glad that I didn't.  The brutality of it shocked me in a very visceral way.  I was horrified by its depiction of such a grim future, and by the very thought of a society that would pit children against one another in a fight to the death.  Needless to say, this is a very intense book and one that is very violent as well.  I don't think that it's a reason to prevent a mature child from reading it, but I do think it's a reason for a parent to read it as well.  This is a book that needs to be discussed, whose themes need to be explored.    Yes, The Hunger Games is a work of fiction, but it does contain many elements of truth that are relevant to our world today.  The brutal regime that controls Panem is not that different from the brutal regimes that control many parts of the globe even as I type these words.  I think it is only natural to want to shelter our children from this kind of violence, but I feel the book provides a very good jumping off point for such discussions.  If the plight of those who are oppressed and whose human rights are violated by their own government isn't an issue important for children are aware of, I'm not sure what is.    The book also has a lot of important themes about compassion and complicity.  In a world like Panem, compassion mightseem like a very dangerous emotion, as it may distract a person from their fight for survival at any cost.  But is the moments of compassion and grace in the book that underscore our capacity as human beings.  Even in the face of a world gone mad, compassion is the one emotion that guarantees there will be some light, some hope in that world.  As the book shows, the act of complying is far more dangerous because it removes something essentially human from us, leading us down the path toward indifference to the suffering of others.  As children enter their difficult teen years, these are extremely important themes.  It is at this age that children are first beginning to learn that, while it may be easier to comply, the only way in which to be able to live with one's actions is to live with compassion.    As powerful as the novel's themes are the novel's main characters.  Though Katniss is the embodiment of the survivalist and Peeta is the embodiment of compassion, they are both more than that.  Katniss especially is extremely complex.  She is neither a hero nor a villain, but a very human character trying to cope in a brutal, heartless world.  Her actions are sometimes selfless and sometimes selfish, but she is always someone with whom the reader can identify.  How could anyone possibly know what is truly in their heart when dealing with the sort of reality with which Katniss has been forced to deal?    I was simply blown away by this novel.  It deals with so many important issues without being at all preachy.  Instead, by making the world in which Katniss and Peeta live so violently, disturbingly real, the reader can do little else than think deeply about the issues central to the book's themes.  By allowing the reader to live vicariously through Katniss and Peeta, it enables us to form a deeper, more profound understanding of what it means to be a human being, and what it means to be truly courageous.
0802130208|3.0|ignatius character is brilliantly portrayed. his pompous language and the trouble he finds himself in are hilarious. however, the story becomes quickly a joke repeated again and again. there is no development of characters or at least those are flawed. i did enjoy the book and i would be definetely rereading some of the parts involving ignatius but i do not share the same enthusiasm with all who gave it 5 stars.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a great story; of course it isn't better than the book but I really recommend this DVD to everyone who enjoys seeing romance stories.<br /><br />I also recommend that you read 'The Notebook', 'Message in a Bottle', 'A Walk to Remember', and 'The Rescue' by Nicholas Sparks.<br /><br />Take my word, his books are awesome.
B000ZN802W|4.0|We all watch movies, but not all of us understand them completely.    (English is not my first language, but I'll do my best)    I just finished watching this movie and as I do with every movie I like, I wanted to read the bad reviews.    Many people complain that they didn't like the movie because they hated the character, they hated how selfish and self-centered he was. That was the point.    He was young & looking for something else, to find himself and his place in this world. He didn't want to plan everything, he just wanted to live day by day, and go to alaska, go into the wild.    I really think he had a good idea of what he wanted to do, but not what was good for him. What you think is what will ultimately make you happy might not be that way. He was so focused on Alaska that he missed so many things along the way, he missed something he finally learned, RELATIONSHIPS.    You can live your life day by day, but in his search for happiness, he missed the potential happines right in front of him.    There are many points of this movie that I think people missed, I won't continue writing because I'll never stop and I hate way too long reviews.        People can learn things from everyone and everything. You could learn something by someone's experience, either to do as someone did, or to avoid what someone did.    Some people didn't know what to learn about this movie, Christopher McCandless would have hated you lol...    btw, the accuracy of the actual story is not that relevant, most real event movies are inspired by the events...
0345349571|5.0|I waited thirty years to read this after coming across it at the UCLA bookstore in 1982. It is one of the best accounts of the history of life around the 100 Years War, and a spyglass into what it was really like in 14th century France. A truly hard to put down book filled with hundreds of gold nuggets. I had no idea that class structure was fixed down to what you could wear and what you could not, and that nobility cold be lost in one generation if the practice of arms was not conducted or an un-noble profession was practiced such as a merchant. So many things jump out at you with Barbara Tuchman. I will most certainly have to read the Guns of August which I have had my eye on since the 5th grade. Granted: Reading Tuchman is not the easiest style and grammar so have your Wordbook Dictionary available. I loved it and wish she was still alive to write about the Crusades as she surely would have been interested with all the religious conflict in the world today especially in this last decade. I recommend this to ANYONE interested in chivalry and the military folly of France that seemed to repeat itself over and over despite obvious lessons. She provides a deep insight into the Frenchman of today as illustrated by knights, kings and prelates of the 14th Century. Just as surely as the French ran from the field at Poitiers they did so again at the World Cup in South Africa. I finally found the origins of French arrogance, impetuosity, and ignorance of the obvious. \\"A Distant Mirror\\" left me laughing all the way to Paris! A must for any Englishman or German interested in French folly. Or anyone for that matter.

B002N2XHXU|5.0|By now most readers are aware of the controversy surrounding some of the factual elements of this book.  Still, \\"A Long Way Gone\\" is immensely readable, eye-opening and hard to put down.  It gives a raw insight into a war that engulfed many young boys and forced them to fight within it.  Ishameal Beah is conscripted by the national forces to fight against the rebel army (RUF).  However, many of his actions and those of the nation's soldiers are no different than those employed by the rebel forces.  Many innocent civilians are mercilessly caught between the unforgiving sides.  Life is rendered meaningless and survival becomes the only objective.    Most Westerners were not aware of the conflict in Sierra Leone much less the atrocities that were taking place therein.  \\"A Long Way Gone\\" gives but a glimpse into that tumultuous period.  Very readable and highly recommended.

My only disappointment was the ending when the last two pages came and I was like \\"WHAT?\\" I felt like the author just decided she wanted to end the story. I felt cheated by the way she did it so quickly.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|This movie deserves every bit of five stars, because for the most part it throws most of the conventional Hollywood playbook out the door but doesn't fall into the trap that so many of the anti-Hollywood type movies do (especially in the scfi genre).  First to compare this to Alien/Aliens is not very honest.  While there is a small similarity it ends there.  If you really think it copied Alien/Aliens then you either a) didn't watch the whole movie or b) just missed it completely in the end.  The movie is about mankind in a very personal and intimate way that most scifi movies miss completely.  The characters worked well and were very believable from a movie stand point.  The plot builds, molds, and develops well all the while twisting itself just when you think you have a good idea of what it's all about.  In fact I sit thinking and looking back on it to find more things I did not pick up on and really will have to watch it several more times to recheck my thoughts and theories.  If you are looking for an intelligent movie that will surprise you but not come across as someone trying to impress themselves with their ideas and writing, this is it.  If you want a movie to get you out of the processed Hollywood hum drum then this is it.  If you want the same old processed Hollywood garbage and like simple movies that are easy to understand, go elsewhere.  My kudos to all involved especially the well cast actors/actresses that played the roles, thank you.

B000HIVQD0|4.0|One of the best debut rock albums I have heard. Dont get me wrong its a good album but not great. The first opening track is an average/mediocre song so is the next track phone call. A few nice soft songs on the album like brass in pocket and kid. But the highlights of the album in my opinion are there 2 dreamy sort of melodic songs which are \\"Up the Neck\\" and \\"private life\\".  This album is definitely worth adding to your music collection.

0634022296|4.0|You get the Beatles songs in words and chords. Wonderful. Beware that the books' format is a SMALL ONE. Slightly bigger than a a dime store novel, and thick. There is a slight drawback in keeping the book open, being so thick, that eventually you must break the spine of the book to keep it open. I'm waiting for the pages to start falling out. Book should have been issued with a spiral spine format.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Two facts MOST theater-lovers know early on:<br /><br />1) Mama Mia on Broadway is the BEST time ever!<br />2) Movie adaptations of live theater are never as good.<br /><br />That being said, I have a fresh idea about the recent movie version of ABBA's Mama Mia- FORGET ABOUT THE BROADWAY SHOW! Comparing the stage \\"Spectacle\\" and the movie is like comparing a big chocolate cake U can eat, to a picture of a chocolate cake you cannot. The picture of the cake will still make you smile, even if U cannot sink your teeth into it.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the movie version of Mama Mia. Essentially a story about a young woman getting married, it becomes a delicious twist of family secrets and revelations. After she reads secret information kept by her mother, Donna, Sophie devises a plan she does not share with her mom. She invites 3 strangers to her wedding, These men are all from her mom's past, a past Donna wants to keep distant. Sophie does share this plan with her 2 best friends and her fiance, BUT only after she sends the invitations. This sets in motion a madcap string of events with short and long-term effects. The audience can now sink their teeth into some fun escapades, as Sophie attempts to keep Donna in the dark as long as possible.<br /><br />The cast of this movie is a dream. Taking some of Hollywood's Elite adds to the universal appeal to basically a niche(musical)movie. Even those people who are not fans of musicals can enjoy this movie for its star quality.<br /><br />Meryl Streep, in the lead role of Donna Sheridan, is fantastic. She shows the struggle of a single mom, trying to make ends meet by running a hotel in Greece, very authentically. The range of emotion the part of \\"Donna\\" requires, is second nature to Ms. Streep. And, while a complete shock to me, she must have known that her vocal ability was as on par as was needed. She was right. Her version of \\"The Winner Takes it All\\" is quite moving. Her transformation from serious, all-work-no-play, hard-nosed Donna to full of Life Donna is fun to watch.<br /><br />As Sophie Sheridan, Amanda Seyfried, is both dainty and emotional. A relative newcomer(at least compared to the others in the cast) Ms. Seyfried commands the screen whenever she is the main focus. Her scene on the boat with her \\"fathers\\" is very moving. She also can carry quite a tune. \\"Slipping through my Fingers\\", the duet she shares with Ms. Streep is really fantastic.<br /><br />The actors playing the 3 potential fathers are not quite up to the task in one way or another. The best of the bunch is Colin Firth, who plays Harry Bright. His voice is quite good, although he has no real solo in the film. He does however have a big secret reveal towards the end of the film that was the one big plot line difference between stage musical and movie. It's a fun scene to witness.<br /><br />Stellan Skarsgard, as Bill Anderson, is very funny in some scenes, touching in others. His voice is adequate, I guess. \\"Our Last Summer\\" is a song he sings with the other \\"fathers\\".<br /><br />Then there is Pierce Brosnan, as Sam Carmichael. As far as acting goes, he is really good. The scenes he shares with Ms. Streep are really well-acted. HOWEVER, his singing is terrible. I mean REALLY BAD. Certain times, I thought a cat was being harmed slightly off camera. Some people were surprised to learn that Mr. Brosnan could sing, then they found out HE CANNOT!!!!!! But he was Bond...James Bond, so cut him some slack.<br /><br />Two other big names round out the main cast of \\"Mama Mia\\". Christine Baranski, as Tanya, a many-times divorced boozer, is one third of Donna and the Dynamos, a girl-group from years ago. Ms Baranski is always a scene-stealer in any movie she is in. During one scene in \\"Mama Mia\\", Ms. Baranski tries to avert the advances of a friend of the groom-to-be. She sings \\"Does Your Mother Know\\" as a way to both flirt and repel this \\"YOUNG man\\". As a veteran of Broadway and the silver screen, Ms. Baranski's acting and vocal talents are very well perfected.<br /><br />As \\"Rosie\\", Julie Walters is the second third of the group. Younger audiences know Ms. Walters as Mrs. Weasley, from the Harry Potter movies. \\"Rosie\\" is a semi-famous cookbook author who seems to fall hard for Stellan Skarsgard's \\"Bill\\". \\"Take a chance on me\\" is her play at a life with Bill. Both are fantastic.<br /><br />So, Mama Mia, the MOVIE, is a fantastic time. Is it the same as seeing it on Broadway? Certainly not. But for reaching a far more widespread audience, this movie is perfect!rs is the second third of the group.

0307454541|4.0|I'm skeptical of \\"libris populi,\\" books that suddenly wash over society to public and critical acclaim. I was really burned by \\"The DaVinci Code\\" (we all were), about how new and exciting and different the writing was, and you have to give Dan Brown credit; he took an idea that was floating around for years and brought it to the public's attention. But the book itself was nothing but a whole chase novel and it wasn't a surprise that it was quickly made into a movie. Recently \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" has been creating the same sort of public reaction. Fortunately, there's a little more in \\"Girl\\" to hold a readers attention and worth the price of the trip that author Stieg Larsson takes you on.<br /><br />\\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" is the dual story of Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading financial reporter in Stockholm, and Lisbeth Salander (a play on salamander?), an anti-social possibly mentally ill but gifted private investigator.<br /><br />As \\"The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo\\" starts Mikael Blomkvist has been found guilty of Swedish libel laws because he wrote a story about a prominent industrialist that he couldn't back up with documentation. Mikael takes a leave of absence from his magazine, Millennium, until the heat is off. Mikael accepts a position from Henrik Vanger, the head of another prominent industrialist family to ostensibly write a chronicle of the Vanger family history. Mikael's actual assignment is find the killer of Harriet Vanger who disappeared off an island at a family gathering while the island was cut off from the mainland. The classic murder in a locked room scenario. As Mikael crawls through the Vanger family history he discovers a family that put the dysfunction in dysfunctional. There are Nazi's in the family, religious zealotry, abusive parents, promiscuous children, relatives who embrace the family and relatives trying to disavow the family connection at all costs. A little bit of something for everybody.<br /><br />The parallel story is, of course, Lisbeth Salander's. Lisbeth is literally \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" Lisbeth is a ward of the state, although in her mid 20's, her life has been held in check because of a mysterious childhood incident that has put her at the mercy of a failed system and corrupt guardians. Lisbeth has a very subjective moral code that deals mostly in black and white assumptions of people. Her saving grace is her abilities to find information via computer (a hacker) and her job as a freelance private detective.<br /><br />I don't read a lot of mystery's, but I found a lot of the plot points to be pretty transparent that details seemingly mentioned off handedly by characters are going to be important in the solution to the mystery, almost like having it highlighted IMPORTANT POINT HERE! The motivating reason for Mikael to move to Hedeby, to solve the mystery of the missing and presumed dead Harriet is predicated on an obvious bit of misdirection in a basic misunderstanding of motives. I think it is assumed by the author that the reader will assume the interpretation of the characters is correct.<br /><br />The title of the book when it was published in Sweden was \\"Men Who Hate Women.\\" I read an interview with the U.S. publisher of \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" and the title and cover design were made more intriguing for the U.S. audience. But \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" (if not as catchy and intriguing) is a more apt and descriptive title of what the book is about. Early on Lisbeth is given very little to do with the main plot of finding the murderer of Harriet Vanger, but she runs into her own man who hates women. The development of Lisbeth's character is slow in coming, the bits and pieces of her back story are intriguing and develop a mystique around her; Larsson is slow to get her into the central mystery of the story.<br /><br />You're probably thinking that with all those shortcomings this is an unfavorable review. No, despite these shortcomings \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" works. The story is simple but elegantly constructed and I found it to be entertaining and readable. The main characters are sympathetic despite their flaws. The bits and pieces we're given of Lisbeth at the beginning are intriguing, like lightning flashes in the dark, we want to see more than her silhouette. Mikael for his faults is a sympathetic character and as he lurches about in the Vanger family history we learn he's basically a decent person, but compared to the Vanger family, most other families would be considered normal. We're also given villains to be shocked at, and not one, but at least three love stories. As all the threads of the mystery are pulled together they seem natural and organic to the characters, no details of the mystery are obscured from the reader, there's no left field revelation that appears out of no where in the solution of the mystery and there's no dues ex machina in it's solution.<br /><br />The proof of the success of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is, is the reader interested in the characters enough to go along and see what happens in the next book of the trilogy? I am.<br /><br />The DVD for \\"[[ASIN:B003FBNJ4U The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo]]\\" comes out July 6th.simple but elegantly constructed and I found it to be entertaining and readable.

Imagine it on a 46 inch high def T.V. with Blue Ray technology. This is the finest acted Western ever made.  Even Robert Urich and Ricky Schroder had all-star performances. Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones were fantastic as former Texas Rangers Woodrow Call and Gus McRae, whose relationship rivals any in film history.  A must see for any fan of the old West.
0061474355|5.0|I am actually surprised (and more than a little angry) that I had never picked up Sabriel before. More surprisingly, I had never even heard of Sabriel before this year. Yeah, I know. That revelation is almost a crime against readamanity. Sabriel is a fantasy about a strong teenage girl who has magical powers. Everything about this book sounds right up my alley. So why wasn't I aware of this book? I have sucky friends who have never read anything published before Twilight.<br /><br />Sabriel has been raised in a small land called Ancelstierre, which is eerily similar to England by the way, far from the Wall and the menancing beings of the Old Kingdom. For the most part, she has been oblivious of the doings and history of that part of her world. Unfortunately, this dangerous countryside holds the house of her father, who must remain there to carry out his work. Her father is Abhorsen, the famed necromancer who binds the dead back to the land of the dead. When her father does not show up for his moonly meeting with Sabriel, she fears he has gone missing. She must take her powers and travel into the Old Kingdom, a place she is knows little about, to find her father. To help her with her journey, a cat and perhaps malicious spirit named Mogget and a man named Touchstone join her.<br /><br />When I was updating my layout, I started going through authors' websites to add to my blogroll. One of these authors was the lovely Catherine Gilbert Murdock, who wrote what may be my favorite read of the year and possibly my whole life. She has a list of her favorite books, which I suggest you meander on over and look at, and Sabriel just happened to be on the list. Catherine had an amazing quote about the series that struck me as so correct that I had to share it here:<br /><br />Years after reading Sabriel, I remain awed by his ability to drop readers in the middle of this foreign world - plop! - and expect us to soldier along until things explain themselves.<br /><br />I almost jumped up and down, squeeing, \\"OMG! She gets me, she gets me! Catherine & I are BFFS because we shared a brainwave!\\" -gigglesnort- This is exactly how I felt in the beginning of the story. Garth Nix makes understanding his world nigh impossible without just girding your loins and shouldering through the book. I had no idea what the frack Free Magic was, or Charter Magic was, or what the different types of death creatures were, or what a Charter Stone was, or or or. You see I could go on for days. But I am perfectly fine with being confused with a world, and I could feel it in my bones that Sabriel would be a winner if I kept with it for a little while longer. Boy, was I right. I appreciated the fact that Sabriel knew next to nothing about the Old Kingdom. Her ignorance was part of the reason of the little explanation given. The author was waiting to reveal all of the Big.Secrets until Sabriel was ready. The two different magic concepts were explained, quite literally, on the run as Sabriel used one type of magic against the evil forces, who were using the other type, while she tried to reach her destination.<br /><br />One interesting aspect of the story hit me on the head while I was reading reviews on Goodreads, after I had finished the book. Sabriel has ZOMBIES. Like big, scary, people-eating, back from the dead ZOMBIES! I hadn't put together that some people might see the creatures that came back from the realm of dead as zombies. I didn't see the relation at all while I was obliviously reading. For hardcore zombies fanatics out there, I wouldn't necessarily be putting Sabriel automatically on my to be read list because the of the zombies. Maybe I didn't think of zombies right away because I don't think of zombies as intelligent. They have a desire to feed, and that's all they have. They don't recognize power or hierachies, while the creatures in Sabriel are intelligent, without a doubt. They can think and reason. They know why they have to feed. They know they must follow creatures more powerful than themselves. A brain does not a zombie have. And they devour souls, not body parts. But potatoes, patatoes.<br /><br />The character of Sabriel is ahmazing. She is strong and capable of handling herself, while still taking care of those around her or that may have gotten between her and her enemies. She is never TSTL, which I always appreciate in any character. She is an independent woman and worthy of admiring. I would have liked to see more of the women in her world, for comparison. Its hard to tell if the world in which Sabriel inhabits accepts more 'modern' women and if Sabriel's attitude would be commonplace in the Old Kingdom or Ancelstierre. Somehow I guess not, but that is just my experience with most fantasies set in monarchies such as the Old Kingdom. However, my favorite character, without a doubt, was Mogget. An evil spirit wrapped up in a snarky cat. Can I spell amazing and wonderful any more ways? I loved how Garth Nix portayed him as mysterious and shady. The wool was pulled over my eyes completely. I was so willing to believe Mogget was not malacious. Even when he attacks Sabriel, I was shaking my head, saying to myself, \\"There must be some better explanation of this attack.\\" Yeah, I am an idiot. Even then, it's wonderful how Sabriel must lean on Mogget after he has tried to get rid of her forever.<br /><br />The only character who I felt was a little lacking, was Touchstone. He didn't seem real enough for me, and therefore the romance wasn't my favorite. It's easy to call, seeing as how there is basically only one boy and one girl throughout the entire novel. And the first time Sabriel sees him, Touchstone is naked. That always signifies smexy time and helps things along.hemselves. A brain does not a zombie have. And they devour souls, not body parts.

B0031ZWZR2|5.0|As I said in my title I consider FlashForward an amazing show, an intelligent one like there hasn't been for a very long time on television.  It is a great pitty that ABC has decided to kill futher seasons and personally I think that they are crazy and tif the rating has gone down is because of ABC very own fault. They stopped the show for months because of the Olimpics and then made wired choices for the time of broadcasting.  ANyway, I truly hope they will decide to go on and safe FlashForward.  It is a show that has so much potential that would be really sad to loose it.

B003J7HONW|4.0|Those who are unfamiliar with Inna might recall the radio and club play dance smash \\"Hot.\\" There have been other singles released from this album, including \\"Love\\" and \\"Amazing\\" and \\"10 Minutes.\\" Another standout track is \\"Don't Let the Music Die.\\"<br /><br />Inna does not have the greatest voice range, and the songs develop a relative \\"sameness\\" to them after a while.....but overall it is very catchy, with a ton of hooks and tight beats. This album would be perfect for fans of Cascada, Annagrace, Sylver, and especially Lasgo. The songs stop short of being \\"trance\\" but they are more dance than pop.<br /><br />On her next outing, Inna should really include a ballad, and also incorporate some different tempos into the mix. All the great pop singers (like Madonna, for example) are able to craft excellent pop albums by subtly mixing up the elements that play to the strengths that they do have, which Inna needs to explore more. There is nothing earth-shattering here, but there is nothing terrible, either. It's just a fun, melodic dance-pop record, and if you like that style, than this album is worth the import price.
B000002GBJ|4.0|Best-known as the keyboardist in Yes' classic lineup, Rick Wakeman made his debut as a solo artist in 1973 with THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY THE VIII. Styled as a concept album (all but obligatory in progressive rock at that time), each of the album's six songs is a \\"musical portrait\\" of one of that English monarch's spouses. However, apart from the song-titles, the concept is tenuous at best, and each track on Wakeman's debut can be appreciated on its own terms as a slice of enjoyable, and often even engrossing, prog.    Appropriately enough, the keyboard dominates the soundscape here as Wakeman struts his stuff. Less technically gifted than his main 70s rival Keith Emerson, Wakeman is also subtler than he (although \\"subtler\\" is of course a relative term), opting for a more composed, less brazen approach, allowing him to show off the full battery of early 1970s keyboards, from Moog to Mellotron to Hammond C-3, in layers of instrumental textures. His showboating reaches its crescendo on the Bach-inflected \\"Jane Seymour\\", which also reveals the limits of his talents. In contrast to the dense fugues of yore, Wakeman's pastiche consists mostly of block chords and noodly organ runs, with little of the contrapuntal complexity that makes baroque music so... baroque.    However, Jane Seymour is the weakest moment only because it is here that Wakeman (over)reaches furthest. Throughout the rest of SIX WIVES his prowess is put to better use, especially on the opening \\"Catherine of Aragon\\" (familiar to Yes fans as Wakeman's solo spot during that band's concerts), a concentrated four-minute burst of tightly-composed, dazzlingly-performed progressive rock. But every track has something to recommend it: the gorgeous pastoral melodies of \\"Catherine Howard\\" (adapted from an English hymn), the jazzy intro of \\"Anne Boleyn (The Day Thou Givest Lord Hath Ended)\\" breaking into a keyboard ¬tour de force, the highly-charged bombast of \\"Catherine Parr\\" which finds Wakeman's penchant for grandiosity at its most obvious and most effective. Even the somewhat lackluster jam that comprises much of \\"Anne of Cleves\\" features a barn-burning performance from Wakeman's fellow \\"Yes-Man\\" Alan White on drums.     Indeed, in addition to Wakeman's excellent keyboard work, the musicianship here is top-notch, featuring the rest of Yes's classic lineup on \\"Catherine of Aragon\\", half the Strawbs on \\"Catherine Howard\\", and Alan White on everything else. Despite the presence of so many of his fellow Yes-Men, THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII bears little enough resemblance to Yes, other than that both fall broadly under the category of \\"symphonic prog.\\" Actually, what Wakeman is doing here is more reminiscent of the contemporaneous Italian scene, with the focus less on complexity and more on mood, with lots of sweeping melodies and keyboard textures. Wakeman is fundamentally a conservative, foregoing jazzy dissonance and experimentalism in favor of grand symphonic gestures. For those who share his tastes, or really for any aficionado of early 70s progressive music, this is a standby well worth owning.

B001HN694K|5.0|I have to be honest, sometimes Burton is a huge hit or miss for me. This one was definitely a hit. This is not only a very well done movie adaptation of Alice In Wonderland, but it incorporates many elements of \\"Through The Looking Glass\\" as well. The end result is a movie with many unknown twists to those who haven't read the second book.  The special effects were astounding, there was not one little part that wasn't a hundred percent convincing.  Johny Depp was perfect casting as the Mad Hatter. In fact everyone, which includes Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen, Anne Hathaway as the white queen (yes, there is another awesome queen), and more, including voices by Alan Rickman and Michael Sheen.    And yes, it is far better than the Disney movie \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" the animated version.    All in all this was a very fresh adaptation of a well-known story/ies, even those who were never fans of Alice In Wonderland may find themselves enjoying this movie. Tim Burton fans will also be very happy.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Since I heard \\"Road to Zion\\" featuring Nas from Damian Marley's last album (Welcome to Jamrock), I knew this idea of making an album together would be amazing. The album has a variety of sounds, melodies, and styles that will entertain you from start to finish. The whole concept of awareness towards Africa makes this album extra special. If you are a dancehall,reggae, and rap fan,but also a fan of conciousness, you should check this out ASAP! You'll thank me later!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We have played Settlers of Catan several times and introduced people to the game.  One of the most interesting features is the amount of change that can be encorporated into the game setup to make the game a little bit different every time it is played.  The most educational aspect of this game appears to be the bargaining - children would learn the lesson that people need to make compromises that benefit themselves and others to be successful.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Why pay more for an HDMI cable when they all do the same thing. I use this cable to watch movies from my computer to my flat screen and the picture is HD quality. I am very satisfied with the HDMI cable.
B002JCSWVG|5.0|This is a wonderful depiction of the South Arican country and the great person Nelson Mendella.  The story line is very interesting and gives a great account of the history of the country and its president at that time.  I recommend this Blu-ray highly.
1597801585|5.0|This story is about a \\"brave new world\\", set in a tough/cruel culture-torn Thailand; where gene-modified grain, disease, animals, and even people, combine to force radical changes.<br /><br />The story expands on some of the ideas that I've seen presented by the author in short stories.  The pace is high, and the human competition & corruption is rough - and only the toughest will survive until the end.  There is violence, but it is not overly done - as is the case with so many \\"cyber punk\\" novels these days... in other words, the violence makes sense within the context of the story.<br /><br />The unique environment and excellent writing provides a good read... definitely the best SciFi book I've come across since Daemon.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I know this film has received mixed reviews, but my friends and I were laughing so much and so hard that the 2 and 1/2 hours flew by.  We even liked the fact that the setting was in the Middle East!  We thought we would explode at Samantha and her escapade in the market in her shorts.<br /><br />The costumes were over the top but isn't that also what these girls are about?  To have four friends like these ladies would make a person extremely lucky!!!<br /><br />Don't miss seeing this film because of silly professional reviews....go see for yourself!
B001C08RHA|5.0|Great action movie with intellectual aspects.  Good for everyone except young children due to graphic violence.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|I purchased the original Sinatra/Jobim LP at the Army PX in the late 60's just when both Bossa Nova and Sinatras Reprise label were \\"the sound\\" in High Fidelty and Jazz/Pop. A digital CD was released by Reprise in the 1990's.  I have all three versions of the recordings and still find the LP, even with early Dolby noise reduction, to still be the warmer and sonicly balanced of all three versions.  For those who havent a clue of what I just said, then you need to purchase this disc.  It's Sinatra/Ogerman/Jobim at their very best.  Sinatras voice was at it's best, full of warmth and expression with Jobims music, new chords, melodies and lyrics riding on the orchestrations of Claus Ogerman provided both we Sinatra and Jazz fans with a embarasment of riches.  Ogermans charts are right on and the colaberation of all three musicians is more than evident.  Tracks 11-20 of the Sinatra/Jobim disc gives the listener a chance to hear other tunes from a later session, with arrangements by Eumir Dedato and orchestra conductor Morris Stolof.  Not quite up to par with Ogermann but still quality work.  These tunes didn't make the cut because quality LP's usually held no more than six cuts (songs) per side and I'm sure that the later session was not quite up to Franks standards.  My feeling as a musician and recording engineer is that here you have one of the best if not unusual discs of the Sinatra songbook.  His voice is dead on, Jobim at his creative best and whats left to say about any arranger who worked with Frank with Claus Ogerman at his best.  The Amazon price was a steal and shipping was free for this one.
B00127RAJY|5.0|All I can say is this is a fantastic workout dvd!  I love the biggest loser tv show and Jillian clearly knows what she is doing.  I ordered this because the workouts are only 20 minutes (really closer to 25.) As a mother of three and commuting to a full time job, it's difficult to find a lot of time for working out.  This was perfect and not too expensive so definitely worth a try.  I have not seen insane weight lose and I'm on level 3 day 28 of working out every single day.  Total weight loss 3 lbs.  That being said I am not over weight, but have this stubborn post baby 8 lbs that won't go away and I am a fairly active person anyway.  But... and this is a HUGE but, I have lost inches and that started the first week of the program.  My total inches lost are -.25 chest, -1.5 love handles, -1 waist, -1.5 hips, -.25 neck,and -.25 thighs.  It really does get you results.  I would gladly take inch lose and definition over a lower weight on the scale!  I also have knee problems and this was not super high impact, so it worked well for me.  Just give it a try!  Loved it so much I'm going to try her Yoga meltdown dvd next.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|A wonderful observation of the young life of Princess Victoria to becoming the Queen of England. And during this time, she meets, falls in love, and marries Prince Albert.
B00337KM2S|3.0|I got this movie expecting great things.  It was nominated for multiple Oscars, including movie of the year, best actor, and two best supporting actress.  Its a fairly light weight film.  Clooney plays a man who works for a company that lays off people.  He flys around the country, laying off people.  He has no personal life so he prefers to be on the road.  While on the road, he mets a woman who also travels a lot.  They have a one night stand and then starting hooking up regulary while they are on the road.      One day, he realizes he wants a real, lasting relationship so he tracks her down, only to find that she is married and has a family.  Kind of depressing really.    The acting is good, but the plot itself is nothing special, just a lightweight romantic comedy.

B000000ZGO|5.0|All of us know who Isaac Hayes is.  But for those of you who only knew him as south park's chef or for the omnipresent Shaft soundtrack, and asked yourself, what's all the fuss about when he passed, BUY STEAL OR BORROW THIS ALBUM. Ike, as he was known to his peoples, was a musical genius.The   originator of the LP and this album being the genesis of modern soul.  This album contains songs that have been sampled thousands of times, and sets the mood when winding down with that special someone. This album also served as a text book to budding musicians and songwriters alike, as he only wrote one song but rewrote the rest. On all but one song he took previous hits from other established artist and remade them to the point where Ike's version is considered the standard for many generations after. These songs are now Ike's tunes. The mood and musical theatrics and sonic expansion of this album can only REALLY  be matched by his next album \\"To be continued\\". Many great albums and movies and even an OSCAR came after. But if you ever wondered who was Isaac Hayes, grab this album a bottle of scotch and just listen...
0446563048|5.0|When I heard Tony Hsieh speak at SxSWi in 2009, I was only vaguely aware of Zappos.com, and that mostly because of their advertising and wifi sponsorship in Denver airport. I couldn't imagine wanting to buy shoes online, so never bothered to look at the site.<br /><br />However, Hsieh's talk caught my attention. Here was a company visibly practicing many of the principles of customer service - and its importance in a company - that I had developed for myself in the course of my career, but had had little opportunity to implement. I realized long ago that truly great customer service would require a corporate culture and mindset quite different from the ones I was working in or dealing with, but I alone could not effect the necessary changes.<br /><br />Zappos sounded like a great place to work: they were getting customer service right, and this was proving out for them, financially and otherwise. When I heard Hsieh speak a SxSWi I was intrigued enough to consider having a look at their job openings. But my job at Sun was exciting and fun, and I had no desire to move to Las Vegas, Zappos' home base. Seven months later Zappos became part of Amazon, a piece of news I somehow missed (had quite a lot going on in my own life at the time).<br /><br />Still, I was now aware of Zappos and what it was really about (hint: it's not shoes!). So, when someone recently tweeted about the Delivering Happiness project around Hsieh's new book, I signed up. I had an ulterior motive: we, too, have books to sell, and I was curious to see what they were doing to market it. I didn't read the fine print, I'm afraid, and overlooked the fact that there would be homework to do quite soon.<br /><br />So I was surprised a couple of weeks ago to receive a package with two advance copies of the Delivering Happiness book, with the request that I post a review on my blog during the week of June 7th, the book's release date. This week has been tumultuous (on a part with just about every other week in my life in, oh, say, the last three years...), but here I am.<br /><br />About the Book<br /><br />(Yes, this is meant to be a book review.)<br /><br />Delivering Happiness, at 244 pages, is a quick read written in a chatty, friendly style - quite different in both tone and content from the usual \\"How to Succeed in Business\\" books.<br /><br />In the first section, Hsieh covers his own life as an entrepreneur (since childhood!) through the creation and sale of LinkExchange, a dot.com success from which he walked away with quite a lot of pocket change, and some even more valuable lessons. When we can't learn by direct experience, the next best way to absorb and retain information is via stories, and Hsieh generously shares his business lessons through engaging stories from his own life.<br /><br />Though I was working in high tech during the boom, I never managed to get rich. I imagined that those who did went off with their millions, bought fancy houses and cars, and never worried about anything again. This wasn't the case with Hsieh. He mentions that \\"experiences were much more important to me than material things.\\" Well, his post-LinkExchange experiences included nearly going broke during the early years of keeping Zappos afloat.<br /><br />The second section of the book is a history of Zappos and how the founders came to believe that their company was really about customer service, rather than the specific products they sold - after all, anyone could sell the same products. Zappos would differentiate itself by providing the best customer service in the world, and they realized that this would require a different kind of company from top to bottom, bottom to top, outside in and inside out. I won't spoil the story by telling you how; the book offers many examples of how Zappos creates and sustains the necessary corporate culture.<br /><br />Some of these examples are presented in the form of short essays written by employees. That, in itself, gives you a clue: employees are encouraged to think with their own heads, use their own voices and words, and decide for themselves how best to please a customer, rather than  read from canned scripts and act from a limited list of options.<br /><br />The Hollywood climax of the story is that Zappos \\"married\\" Amazon. You can read something very close to that section of the book here. Like most people in high tech, I've been through several corporate buyouts/mergers, and they always make for, um, interesting times. What's interesting about Zappos and Amazon is that, while both do great customer service (I wrote about my love for Amazon years ago), they approach it quite differently. They chose for Zappos to continue to operate independently, using Amazon's technical and financial resources to be able to do some things (I'm betting with the website) that they couldn't have done as quickly on their own. I'll be curious someday to read a follow-up book about what each company is learning from the other.<br /><br />In the final section of the book Hsieh ventures into even bolder territory, sharing research he's done on the new science of happiness and how that can be applied in a corporate environment. All good stuff, I shall certainly do some of the reading he recommends. The new happiness research quoted by Hsieh shows that people are happy when they feel that they: have control over their lives, are making progress towards a goal, are connected to other people, and are part of something bigger than themselves.<br /><br />All of this can be applied to running a company, as Zappos is doing brilliantly. But applying it to the act of a customer receiving a shipment is a stretch in a direction I don't like. I'm wary of the idea that happiness can be delivered in a box in the form of \\"the perfect pair of shoes or the perfect outfit\\". Consumer culture has conditioned us to believe that happiness lies in stuff (or experiences) that can be bought. This may be an inescapable contradiction of capitalism. Companies and economies grow because people buy more and more stuff. To keep them buying, you have to make them believe that your stuff is going to make them happy. But buying stuff is not really what makes people happy, and you are lying to your customers by telling them it will. And it's not just a little white lie, either: \\"material goods will make us happy\\" is the biggest lie the human race has ever told itself. Voracious consumption is destroying our societies, ourselves, and our planet.<br /><br />Which won't make anyone very happy.<br /><br />Tony Hsieh is a smart man and has no doubt seen this contradiction, but for the moment he's still in the business of selling stuff, so he can't state this even if he wants to. However, he now has deep pockets and a large soapbox to go with his considerable talents, brains, and charisma. I'll be watching to see what happens when he turns all this to the question of what, ultimately, is really going to create global happiness.decide for themselves how best to please a customer, rather than  read from canned scripts and act from a limited list of options.

B0028IDXDS|5.0|My newborn is loving this pacifier! And so am I, since it never gets lost, easy to find in his crib and by using it I significantly reduced the number of trips to my son's crib throughout the night since the monkey weights down on baby's chest and does not fall out of his mouth as often as all other pacifiers. Originally I bought it because I thought it was cute but turns out it is very useful.<br /><br />My son can easily grab it with his hand to hold it near his mouth when taking a break. I simply love it and I recommended it to a bunch of friends and everyone seems very happy with it.
1423113381|5.0|_The Red Pyramid_ is an exciting, erudite adventure story that crackles and sparkles through 514 pages of gripping fun.  Aimed at readers 9-12, this witty and engaging novel will also appeals to adults with its hilariously sarcastic humor and engagement with Egyptian mythology.     This is a story of two children who think they are normal kids with pretty normal lives, only to discover that in fact they are \\"blood of the pharaohs\\" and have a very special destiny ahead of them.  Carter and Sadie are brother and sister from a bi-racial family.  After their mom's death, the darker-skinned Carter (now fourteen) travelled the world with his dad, a prominent Egyptian archaeologist, while his lighter-skinned sister Sadie (now twelve) lived with their grandparents in London, who allegedly did not want the darker-skinned child.  The two only see each other a couple times a year, when Carter and his dad come to visit Sadie in London.  But after their dad commits what appears to be an act of terrorism at the British Museum and disappears, the two children realize they have special powers and are forced to rely on each other as never before.    The action and the humor keep you turning the pages, so absorbed in the world of the novel, that you somehow don't even notice that you are learning quite a bit about mythology.  That is one of Riordan's gifts:  both in the Percy Jackson series (with Greek mythology) and in this first volume of The Kane Chronicles (with Egyptian mythology), his story is so seamlessly interwoven with mythological material that when you do come up for air, you realize you learned quite a bit in the most painless way possible.      In Riordan's trademark style, the book is funny from the chapter titles on, including such gems as \\"We Win an All-Expenses-Paid Trip to Death\\" and \\"I Have a Date with the God of Toilet Paper.\\"  The wise-cracking Kane kids have a very winning interpersonal relationship and get off some spectacular, snappy lines.  As the more adventurous and rebellious Sadie sarcastically remarks to Carter when trying to get him to break the rules and break into the library they have been specifically told not to visit:    \\"Brother dear...did your soul leave your body again while Amos was talking, or did you actually hear him?  Egyptian gods real.  Red Lord bad.  Red Lord's birthday:  very soon, very bad.  House of Life:  fussy old magicians who hate our family because Dad was a bit of a rebel, whom by the way you could take a lesson from.  Which leaves us--just us--with Dad missing, an evil god about to destroy the world....Am I missing anything?  Oh, yes, I also have a brother who is supposedly quite powerful from an ancient bloodline, blah, blah, et cetera, but is too afraid to visit a library.\\"     There are also tons of fun one-lines, like     \\"A goddess named Nut?  Is her last name Case?\\"    Riordan's Percy Jackson series is often compared to Harry Potter.  While these series will probably appeal to a similar cross-section of kid and adult readers, and do have certain elements in common (kids with magical powers they didn't know they had, a common story element also seen in \\"Star Wars\\"), these wise-cracking books with their artful interpolation of mythology and modernity are no Harry clones.  These original, artful, first-person narratives are an absolute delight, and I eagerly await the next volume in The Kane Chronicles.

B002ZG997M|4.0|As the title suggests, I felt this was a very inspiring movie in terms of what faith can bring you. And that's saying a lot coming from me as I am not a religious person (though I do believe in a higher power). However, watching this movie and the sheer dedication that Denzel Washington portrays as Eli really inspired me and it was a brilliant showing of how faith can guide a person to their goals. Denzel turns in an overall great performance in his protrayal of Eli, who is on a mission to carry a book across a post-apocalyptic America. Traveling through barren wastelands and the occassional small town that has formed together, he lets nothing and no one stand in the way of his mission. Unfortunately along his trip he comes across a city where Gary Oldman's character is the self proclaimed leader of the city. Oldman's character is seeking out the book that Eli carries and will stop at nothing to get his hands on it. Gary Oldman turns in another wonderful performance as the villain in this movie and he and Denzel play off each other masterfully. I give a good bit of credit to the Hughes brothers for another excellent movie and superb direction in this film - I have greatly enjoyed all of their movies that I have seen thus far (Menace II Society, Dead Presidents, From Hell and Book of Eli).    Overall this was a great movie with plenty of action for those like hardcore action as well as a moving theme in the faith that Eli displays as he makes his way across the wasteland. My only beef with the home release (and some others have mentioned this) is why the heck do they release a blu-ray/DVD combo pack? They have done this with other movies as well and I just don't get it - I mean if one actually wants the blu-ray because they own a BD player (as I do), why in god's name would one want the DVD as well. Obviously one would choose to watch the movie in the highest quality available to him/her. It's a waste of money that inevitably jacks up the price of the package since it's extra media...maybe not by that much but still, I'd rather pay for just the BD and not have to pay ANY extra for the DVD that I will never watch. Oh well, there's no real use complaining since the movie companies will do what they want to do; but still, I personally think it's dumb. Well, that's all I've got, hope you find it useful and definitely see this movie if you haven't...or even if you have, watch it again.
B001HN69AY|4.0|Terry Gilliam is deemed a love-him or hate-him director. For me, I take his films piece-meal. Some parts are great, some oh-hum and some true flops. At his best, Gilliam is far-better than most directors. At his worst, his scripts are frustratingly illogical, distasteful and/or boring. I buy whatever he does though, knowing that all are sucha mix of sublime and crapolla.[[ASIN:B000KB4898 Tideland (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] - TIDELAND is the best and worst of the spotty Gilliam genre`.<br /><br />The overall feeling of this flighty flick The Imaginarium is 'spotty'. Some things work, others don't. There are smiles and grimaces, intrigue and boredom. And so on, throughout. Of all filmmakers, for me, Gilliam is the most artful, daring and independent. Not only are his films different from most all others, but from each other. Gilliam takes chances. That's what true auteurs do, a testament to their love of their art.<br /><br />Here, my Gilliam favorites:  [[ASIN:0780022181 Brazil - Criterion Collection]], [[ASIN:B0026FCNK2 12 Monkeys [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:0783229526 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]. There are many more; most mixed bags. All worthy of a look-see; chances are, the more you view each, the more you'll like it.

B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Just bought one of these and have had the system running about a week. This CPU is something to get excited about, when you consider the price. Overclocked to 3.8 GHZ without breaking a sweat and without much difficulty I'm sure could push further. I have mine paired on an 890gx motherboard, 8gb ddr3 and a Corsair H50 Water Cooler - CPU doesnt break at sweat no matter what you throw at it. Running stress tests you can crank 4 cores up to 100 percent and still surf the web / listen to tunes / generally use your computer and you would never know its even performing a task. This thing is a tank for sure, couldn't be happier. Way to go AMD.
1594488843|5.0|If you believe that people in organizations are primarily motivated by carrots and sticks, you need to read \\"Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\\" by Daniel H. Pink. The long-standing management assumptions about what makes workers tick, according to Pink, are \\"outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science.\\" That's because there is a widening gap between recent scientific discoveries and unquestioned management practices.<br /><br />For most of the 20th century, science and management did share a common assumption about human nature: People are motivated by either biological drives or extrinsic motivation.  Of these two gears, businesses latched onto the rewards and punishments of extrinsic motivation as their primary means for controlling the troops. Thus, Pink notes that most 21st century notions of management presume that people are pawns rather then players.<br /><br />However, Pink cites recent developments in the scientific study of human behavior, as well as in the emegence of innovative management models, that defy the accepted laws of behavioral physics. Scientists have discovered another drive that turns out to be the most powerful of human motivators. This third gear is intrinsic motivation. Until recently, this powerful drive has remained relatively anonymous because it is very fragile, requiring the right combination of environmental factors to thrive: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Unfortunately, this right combination is extremely rare, given that the typical hierarchical organization is more interested in order, control, and  compliance. However, the sudden success of open source  platforms, such as Wikipedia and Linux, are spawning powerful new business models that will not only redefine the corporate landscape, but are also creating work environments where the higher reaches of human nature are free to achieve unprecedented, perhaps  even unthinkable, business performance.<br /><br />In open source platforms, people are autonomous and purposefully connected to their work. Perhaps this explains why so many are even willing to work for free - a clear indicator that intrinsic motivation really is the most powerful driver. Business leaders who learn how to harness the surprising power of this third gear create for themselves an unbeatable competitive advantage, as both 3M and Google have discovered. By giving their employees complete discretion over 15 - 20 percent of their time, these two market leaders have built cultures of highly engaged workers who sustain both innovation and continued success. If you want to understand how you can move your company into third gear, Daniel H. Pink's \\"Drive\\" is your triptik for this journey.urposefully connected to their work.

B00000AOUD|5.0|One might think that an album with only one song (well, two, but only because it's far too long for just one side of a vinyl record) would be 45 minutes of sheer wankery. Wouldn't there be filler? Wouldn't there be needlessly long displays of shallow virtuosity? Wouldn't there be verse after verse of pretentious, humorless philosophical drivel? Wouldn't it, well, suck? These apprehensions are a problem many people (especially critics) have with what we have deemed 'prog'.     Obvioulsy, having given Jethro Tull's \\"Thick as a Brick\\" a whopping five stars, I disagree. \\"Thick as a Brick\\" is a musical and lyrical masterpiece that defies prog's stereotypes. In an ironic twist, the album itself is actually a satire of the very stereotypes it defies. \\"Really don't mind if you sit this one out\\", warns Ian Anderson at the beginning of the album, aware that his band is about to embark on an adventure that his listener might not understand (\\"I may make you feel, but I can't make you think\\"). Ideed, what follows is a massive epic poem that requires close reading to attempt to understand. Humorless philosophical drivel? I suppose it depends on the kind of person you are as to whether you think it's particularly meaningful, but what can't be denied is the presence of dry humor, with lines like \\"Your sperm's in the gutter, your love's in the sink\\" and \\"A man is born, and we pronounce him fit to fight/There are blackheads on his shoulders/And he pees himself in the night\\". This would sound silly if it were sung by other great prog singers like Yes's Jon Anderson or Pink Floyd'd David Gilmour, but Ian's tongue-in-cheek English folkiness suits his writing perfectly. Clearly, Ian and the gang are having fun.    With all the writing aside, let us consider Jethro Tull's use of their musical abilities. Yes, the album does feature many displays of technical prowess, but the music never lacks inspiration. Idea after idea races along with just as much energy as punk rock has at its best. JT's rhythm section manages to juggle loud guitars, flute, and organ at a manic pace. There is no filler. \\"Thick as a Brick\\" is also produced much better than Jethro Tull's other big album \\"Aqualung\\".    I am giving this album my highest reccomendation.

0812550706|5.0|Of all the books in this series, this is by far my favorite.  It keeps the philosophical to a minimum, and instead focuses on Ender's training as a young soldier.  This is one of those books that can be read again and again without ever getting old.
0307388921|5.0|This novel is really an example of just about everything that I love about Chuck Palahniuk. The plot is strange and different, the storytelling and narrative are unique, and the story is just plain strange.<br /><br />There was a lot that I liked about his novel. I thought that a protagonist Victor was a very interesting character. From his con man acts (which are described excellently and his narrative on the reactions of his \\"Good Samaritan\\" seems spot on and believable). Even his justification that he does it as much for them as he does it for himself is an interesting viewpoint. A major focal point of the story, surrounded around sexual addiction and problems, also creates some memorable scenes and really shapes the major players in the story.<br /><br />The real meat of the story surrounds scenes at the hospital where Victor must take care of his sick mother. Some of his interactions with is mother do allow the reader to sympathize with Victor, which is interesting given his actions in the rest of the novel. Some of the other players in the hospital, including some of the doctors, really make for some shocking Palahnuik moments.<br /><br />The plot develops into a normal Palahniuk shocker at the end. Though in this case, you can feel a lot of the elements that build into this finale actually starting up earlier in the novel. Some of his novels, the middle of the novel kind of just act as filler to get from start to end, but in Choke's case, the story really builds up to the ending, which makes it that much more satisfying. This is perhaps one of the best of Palahniuk's works to get a start on him, and get introduced to his quirky narrative style and shocking plots.
1401902197|5.0|This book is like my little bible for me: it is my kaleidoscope of Life. Louise Hay deals with 8 essential topics: Health, Forgiveness, Creativity, Prosperity, Job Success, Romantic Relationships, Stress-Free Life, Self-Esteem. At the beginning of each chapter, she gives explanations about each subject and ends the chapter with 20 affirmations. At each affirmation, I give to myself a mark over 10 (1 is minimum, 10 is maximum), so this scale shows me how far I am on the spiritual growth path. When I make a progress from 8 over 10 to 10 over 10, for example, which takes me some weeks or months (it depends on the difficulty of the subject and the speed of my evolution), then I am very glad. When I am able to give to myself 10 over 10 at each and every subject, then I would be able to say that all of my needs are fulfilled.

0891419063|5.0|There are numerous written accounts from the infantryman's point of view of the Pacific theater of War. Sledge's masterpiece,is without equal, it draws you back again and again, not for the brutal horror of the experiences, but more to share in the search for humanity and meaning to where none seems to reside. The humor is there as it's own defense mechanism and moments of comfort are fleeting.
B00338QENI|5.0|I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the origins of modern medicine and just how far we have come. I thoroughly enjoyed the perspective of Lacks' family and what they have had to endure with the lack of privacy these cells have produced. The book was also informative on the origins of cancer, which I realize after reading the book, I did not understand. I think this book is also a great tribute to Henrietta and just how much her cells have done to help others.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|So Strictly Ballroom. I don't know exactly what I was expecting of this movie, but it was definitely different from what I expected. But that is not to say that I did not enjoy it a ton. I thought it was overall a good and really fun movie. The music and dance throughout the movie, as pretty much a method of story telling, worked very well for the movie and keep the story meaningful and engaging.  Some of the characters and lines were a bit outlandish, but all in all, it fit together remarkable well, and created an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Even thought there was nothing overly remarkable about the story's main love interest plot between Fran and Scott, I felt that it still worked out well. The discussion of dance as a act of creating a perceived love as part of the act was interesting and something I have thought about before so I found it nice to be brought up in the movie (even if only for a few lines). I thought that most of then characters, though maybe a bit simple, really came together to create a pretty good story. My personal favorite character was Doug though (even before finding out about his secret). I thought his overall fairly eccentric character was a lot of fun and in ways very relatable.<br /><br />All in all, this was a fun movie. For anyone that is willing to give a bit of a different way to tell a story a chance I would recommend giving it a shot.
0316069906|4.0|This book is a must-read for anyone who well, eats. It really is essential that we begin to understand the systems in place in our society - regardless of how horrible or disgusting they might be. This books brings the industrial food complex into focus in a way that is insightful, interesting, and meaningful. I also really love how Foer reminds us that food is communal, familial, and that this might be one of many reasons that eating meat is so difficult to overcome. Except for a few sections where Foer sounds a little egotistical or whiny - - I really do think this book brings to light some of the horrible practices in place and forces us to truly look at our food system and its effects on society. A great read!
B002KSPKRS|4.0|A few notes before I start, I use rechargeable batteries.  My set up is as follows:  Wireless to router, HDMI to TV, Optical audio from TV, and USB is hooked to TV (this way they are only powered when the TV comes on).    I have owned this headset now for more than six months and mainly play at night when everyone else is in bed.  Overall I am impressed with them, and can no longer imagine playing video games without them.  It's not just the fact that the ability to listen to your game and chat with your friends with these, but the immersion you have while playing games or watching TV.  The sound is superb.  They are very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, and I do not start to sweat or even get warm.  When friends come over and spot them, they always inquire about them.  So I give them a demo.  I pop in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, and load the Cliffhanger Mission.  They get a beautiful view of the mountain ranges and the detail image of Capt. MacTavish.  When Capt. starts speaking, I tell them to close their eyes and listen while I turn the player around.  It is kinda freaky the first time I did it.  Then comes the jets.  While looking at Capt, the jets fly over your head from right to left, and again I turn the player so they can \\"feel\\" the surround sound.  It is really amazing.  These headset has dramatically improved my skill in the game.  I can pinpoint where shots are being fired from, foot steps from an approaching player, and the impact of one who jumped from a high height.  There is no doubt that the performance of the headphones are as advertised.  I have fiddled with the bass boost, and have found that with it on, it becomes really noisy.  It is as if you loose a lot of the mid and high for more bass.  It is kinda hard to hear things.  The bass drowns out everything.    Now to the boom mic.  It is detachable, you can turn it down by it's self.  This is very convenient because it now allows you to turn the other players off when they start excessive chatting and you need to hear critical sounds of the game without having to mute them in game.      Here is a list of problems I have with them:    There is an underlying white noise hissing, and it gets worse when you plug in the boom mic and even worse when you plug in the cable to the controller.  It does go away when you are playing.    Popping.  It is intermittent, but I really notice it when I reach the end of the battery's life and when I reach the edge of the range.  This may be worse for me because I use rechargeable batteries.  MAJOR PROBLEM:  when the batteries are weak and the set dies sometimes it shuts off no problem.  Just goes dead.  But sometimes I get this really loud (I mean painfully loud) buzzing/popping/cracking noise (it varies), and I end up snatching the headset off of my head.    Battery life.  I use rechargeable batteries, and I would have liked to be able to use AA instead of AAA so I can use them for longer periods of time with out having to replace them.  Maybe install one battery on each side, instead of both on one side to help distribute weight.    On some games the sound will be flipped, left to right and right to left.  This is really weird and gives you a funny feeling when you are playing.  It confuses the crap out of you.  You see the enemy move right, but the sound tells you it is moving left.  The first game I noticed this in was Call of Duty: WAW, and then Bioshock 2.  And occasionally the sound will not work at all, but the transmitter shows audio input.  Both of these problems can be fixed by scrolling through your TV inputs and switching back to your XBOX input.  Nothing serious, but annoying otherwise.    The swivel arm where the boom mic attaches to the headset has become worn.  It has a hard time staying in place anymore, and if I bump it by accident, it will drop below my chin.  Major pain the rear while playing, when your friends start having a hard time hearing you.  They are under warranty for one year.Overall, this product is worth the money.
B0039TD7RC|1.0|IMPORTANT!:  this is a review of the sound of the  latest rerelease of \\" Exile on Main Street\\".  we all know and love this album, vinyl  8-track, cassette and CD.  but this new 'version', well all I can say is \\" YUCK\\"!  what they did here with the sound you don't need.  they pumped up the bass and drums, they made it all crispy and dynamic with lots of boom. like some kid with a car EQ. it's  extremely unpleasant to listen to. I believe they've (Don Was etc.) turned it into excrement.  this kind of production is fine for garbage like Lady Googoo and Fall Down Boys but to do it the Stones and particularly this album, well its a sacrilege  that will no doubt be punished in the afterlife.  listening to this is like looking at a copy of the Mona Lisa that somebody ran through Photoshop trying to 'improve' it.  Pass on this gas.  If you don't have the Virgin rereleases , then you better go get them.  Far more indispensable  than this desperate grab for cash.  how much more money does Mick Jagger need?  Until they can put this stuff out on DVD like Neil Young,to really improve the sound then maybe the Stones don't really need to rerelease any of their music.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|See the movie...then read the book.  Brilliant storytelling and excellent historical fiction.  If you know absolutely nothing about art or Holland...as I do...you'll still love this book.  If I can shelve a book I've finished for a year or two, and enjoy it just as much the second or third time around, it becomes a classic in our house.<br /><br />There are several very subtle undertones and references to modern day sex-power struggles that are hard to catch during the first read..Again, just as wonderful during the 'encore' read.

0446563048|3.0|Delivering Happiness is an easy flowing read written in a conversational style. Mr. Hsieh does inform the reader at the beginning of the book of his writing style. Delivering Happiness provides a view from the CEO of how he built Zappos and has created a unique corporate culture. One of delivering 'WOW' to the customer while encouraging a nurturing environment for the employees. From the stories, it would appear Mr. Hsieh is a work hard-play hard person and has found the balance between managing and leading a company. Interesting how the corporate culture continues to evolve as the company grows.<br /><br />I need to note that I was provided an advance copy of the book and the review is my own thoughts on the book.

Easily Seth's best book since All Marketers Are Liars, and in the long run perhaps his most important book period.    Be warned though, you won't be able to read this book all in one sitting. Not because it's bad, or because it's boring, but because it'll change you. (In a good way.)
B001FB5634|1.0|Were we all watching the same movie?  This was probably one of the most depressing and pointless flicks I have had the displeasure of viewing in a very long time.  The only thing, and I mean the ONLY thing, it had going for it was the depth with which Viggo Mortensen injected himself into his role, just as he does with everything, good script or bad.  This, unfortunately, was on the bad side. Its story was so thin and dry that it slowly dragged on and on with no real direction. It seemed like everyone on the production team was trying desperately to figure out new and different ways to fill in the space allotted for a movie of this scope. But they failed miserably; there was never enough to go on. This movie could have been made in twenty minutes, beginning to end, and achieved the same result without the relentless meandering through one meaningless scene to the next. Ptttt! And that kid (Kodi something or other)...my gosh...I've seen better acting by a cardboard box on a windy day. I'm sure someone with real acting ability, or at least someone who could fake it, could have been acquired to play his role. This kid was like wet wood on a fireplace. I never read the book, and now I definitely don't intend to. As already mentioned, Viggo did a great job, so the 20% (1 star of 5) is for him and him only!

B002VWNICW|5.0|I love this movie! It is beautifully acted and filmed and the musical score is wonderful. Yes, it is hard to portray the story in only two hours which leads to a fast pace and changes not completely true to the book. I will admit that until I saw this movie, I had never read Pride and Prejudice or seen any previous film adaptations. I have now read the book and watched previous films and become a Jane Austen fan. Great influence from a movie. Matthew Macfayden is a wonderful, very believable Mr Darcy and Keira Knightley is my most favorite Elizabeth.
B002QGSW8I|4.0|James Rollins is one of my guilty pleasures. He's got the formula down and he executes it well and that is one of the pleasures of reading him. It's the same kind of thing that has kept the James Bond franchise going for over 20 films. I especially like the cool things you learn when reading Rollins and the fact that he includes an afterword where he talks about which aspects of the story are factual and which are fanciful. Don't look for probing examinations of characters' emotional depths here. Do expect a good, action-packed story.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Pros:  The sound of course - paints a picture for your ears if you will  Long cord - for those who sit away from their TVs  Comfortable - I've played for hours without having to take them off due to any agitation or irritation  Control - You can always find a perfect setting for both game and chat volume  Feedback - Hearing your voice allows for self volume control, which I find important since I live in a household with more than 1 person  Multi-Plat - Nothing like being able to switch from ps3 to xbox to pc if I need to    Cons:    Slight buzz - I've learned to tune it out but would like to mention that there is a buzz  Control - That perfect setting you find can be instantly changed if the control is swiped or rubs against something  Mic pickup - Not really a con, more of an annoyance when I have the game and chat volume up high and it shows that I'm speaking into the mic even though no sound is going through.  The clip - I know it's not a major thing but it bothers me, it's already broken      I've own the PX21s for about 2 months.  They have changed how I play.  I know that may sound a little weird but it is true.  Every thing I do in FPSs is now dictated by what I didn't hear before.  Even when I'm not playing shooters the sound it provides is just something else.  It's clear, it's perfect, I can't see why I haven't owned a pair before.    Overall, while not the best, the PX21s are damn good.  Buy these and you won't be upset.

3551354014|5.0|The German version of Harry Potter loses nothing of the magic of the original and is a great way to practice your German. If you've read the English version first the whole story will be easy to understand and after a few pages you'll forget that you're reading in German. Immerse yourself in German and watch yourself become fluent!    Ich habe, genau wie viele andere, am Anfang recht wenig von diesem großen Rummel um den mysteriösen Zauberlehrling Harry Potter gehalten, bis mich mein Freund darauf aufmerksam machte. Er hat nur geschwärmt, als er den ersten Band gelesen hatte. Da es mich dann doch interessiert hat und ich neugierig war, hab ich angefangen zu lesen. Dazu muß ich sagen, dass ich schon ne ganze Weile kein einziges Buch mehr in der Hand hatte, da ich immer etwas \\"Besseres\\" vorhatte, aber Harry und seine Zauberwelt hat mich jeden Abend neu gefesselt und ich habe mich im Laufe des Tages schon richtig darauf gefreut, endlich weiter zu lesen. Ich finde am Abend ist es besonders schön in die Welt von Harry Potter einzutauchen. Man vergisst sämtliche Dinge, die einen zuvor beschäftigt haben und geht über in eine andere Welt, eine schöne Phantasiewelt. Ich konnte danach immer sehr gut einschlafen und habe sogar nachts von Hogwarts, Hagrid und vielen anderen Dingen aus der Welt von Harry Potter geträumt. Ich kann es nur weiterempfehlen !!!!!       Other great books I liked are [[ASIN:1452878641 Bissula (German Edition)]], [[ASIN:1452879362 Pinocchio (German Edition)]] and [[ASIN:1452826048 Die Biene Maja und Ihre Abenteuer (German Edition)]].

B002XTBE6K|5.0|This drama series is very well made.  It is very elegant, authentic, and entertaining.  Comparing to the Emma movie starring Gwyneth Paltrow, it is equally entertaining.  It is not as elegant as the Emma movie but it is more authentic which reflects the real life of the suburban English people.  Because of its duration, it also provides more detail than the Emma movie.  Besides Emma and Mr. Knightly, I like most other characters better in this drama series than in the movie, because they are either more clear or prettier (i.e. Harriet, Jane Fairfax, Mr. Elton).  I highly recommend this drama series.
B003405MF6|5.0|Jeff Beck changes his surroundings all the time: blues, rockabilly, Les Paul, techno, fusion.  You may love one and hate the other,   (just as many old-school Miles Davis fans hated most of his stuff  from \\"In A Silent Way\\" on), BUT, as with Miles, Beck remains Beck in the midst of his environments. His talent has always been to cleverly inject  melodies pulled from the arrangement & split back, mutated in his unique style. His best phrases have always been short & sparse, seemingly saying: \\"I've said what I have to say..you can see where this was going, so why should I bother playing the rest?\\" THIS IS NO EXCEPTION. (On this outing, to me, he sounds like he's been listening to Bill Frissell.) While fans of particular Beck CDs, fans of specific styles of music, may find nothing to love here, fans purely of Beck's guitar playing will get all they need. Granted, there's little or none of the growling, showboating, 'fun' stuff, at least not in the obvious sense, but the soul, touch, & intelligence that make Beck special are evident in every note he plays here.
B001GCUO5W|3.0|I actually watched Shutter Island twice this past weekend. Wait, that's not 100% accurate. The first time I watched it I kept falling asleep; at one point I think I was out for a good 20 minutes. So I watched it again in the daytime on Sunday, and it turns out the movie wasn't quite as bad as me falling asleep might have made it sound.<br /><br />After a clear-minded viewing (versus my original attempt after an exhaustingly long week and a couple of beers), I can say that Shutter Island had some decent moments. I don't know why but even in the first few moments of my initial viewing, something seemed very familiar about the movie. I already knew what the twist was going to be. I mean, I didn't predict all of the intricacies leading up to the twist, but I knew...I just knew!...where we'd end up when the final minute of the long 2 hours plus of a movie's credits rolled.<br /><br />I'm telling ya, I saw a Twilight Zone, Outer Limits or SOMETHING that had the exact same kind of twist...I just can't put my finger on it. There are great movies with great twists all the time (like [[ASIN:B001BRZ5J2 The Sixth Sense]]) that catch me totally off guard at the end, but Shutter Island just didn't.<br /><br />Making matters worse was a storyline that you really have to take with a grain of salt and give the benefit of the doubt to. Not that the trauma of Shutter Island's 67th patient wasn't indeed traumatic. It's just I had a hard time swallowing the whole idea that such an elaborate scheme could be pulled off. I guess that in a perfect world (poor choice of words for a place like Shutter Island) it could happen, but boy did the stars have to line up perfectly.<br /><br />What the film lacked in believability and 'keeping it simple' (and short), it made up for in atmosphere. I don't know about everyone else, but Director Martin Scorsese made me feel like I was on Shutter Island and that was a creepy, helpless feeling; the movie gets an extra star for that. Scorsese created a living, breathing [[ASIN:1401204252 Arkham Asylum]] where the only things missing were the most notorious villains and the Caped Crusader himself. When did the nuts take over the nuthouse?<br /><br />Oh, and a final word on the acting: great. If you like a psychological thriller and you have a lot of patience, you'll probably like Shutter Island, so move on to the 4 or 5 star reviews for advice that's probably more in line with how Shutter Island will affect you. I think 2+ hours was a long time to get to the point, and I could have used a little more action and suspense to get me to the end...in a conscious state.Arkham Asylum]] where the only things missing were the most notorious villains and the Caped Crusader himself.

B003C1SPX8|5.0|REVIEW OF THE REGULAR DVD Version (not the blu-ray) :   WAY overdue on DVD, and despite its flaws - namely, limitations of the source film and the famous stray 'hair' in front of one of the cameras, that was just as annoying in the mid-80's as it is now), Dire Straits' \\"Alchemy\\" is really an essential concert film that any fan of real/honest-to-goodness TALENT should see.  What a novelty in today's music scene - a band that could actually PLAY their instruments.  This should be required viewing/listening for today's young bands.  The main concert runs around 90 minutes or so, and looks better than I remember it looking on MTV & my beat-up videotape from the 80's.  Plus, there are songs here that were not on the one-hour edited tv version (Telegraph Road, Solid Rock).  There's really not a bum note played here, and hilights are many - Knopfler's playing, Terry Williams' drumming, some excellent sax from Mel Collins, great keyboards from the very underrated Alan Clark,  the closing \\"Going Home\\", among others.  Sound is excellent, and nice extras here too - two early BBC appearance clips and an hour-long BBC documentary I'd never seen before, that appears to have been filmed around 1980 or so (during the rehearsals and recording of \\"Making Movies\\" while Pick Withers and David Knopfler were still in the lineup; there is a fair amount of live performance footage in this, from earlier shows).  The blu-ray is pretty expensive, so if you're going to have a conniption over grain/etc. vis a vis the pricey cost of the blu-ray, then you should probably consider at least getting the regular version while it's relatively cheap, because this concert belongs in any serious rock collection.   Accept the limitations in the interest of having this available to view again (though, it's too bad they didn't digitally remove that stray lens hair.......).
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|Every Season only get's better on Ghost Whisperer and Season #5 is no different. Jennifer Love Hewitt shines as Melinda Gordon. Her family complete with the birth of Jim (David Conrad) and Melinda's first child Aiden Lucas Clancy. We jump 5 years ahead to Aiden's 5th Birthday. Guessing the Producers went that way in case the show was canceled by CBS and we'd never know about Aiden's Gift/Powers. Good move since that is exactly what happen. CBS dropped it. Huge Mistake and ABC passed on picking it. Another Huge mistake since the show has a very large and strong fan base. Maybe the Jennifer Love Hewitt, who is one of the Producers could get the rest of the Producers to continue the show on DVD or even as a Online TV Show.<br /><br />Ghost Whisperer should NOT be sent into the Light!
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|I bought Viva La Vida on the recommendation of a friend and Coldplay has had a fair share of success and I understand why because their music can be very soothing and relieving, but for me personally the Coldplay sound is just too light for my tastes. However, I did enjoy the track Strawberry Swing because it sounded a bit heavier than the other tracks on the album and has a really cool tune attached to it. For the Coldplay fan that enjoys their sound or someone who's not interested in a cornucopia of heavy metal guitars and hyped up drums than this album is definitely for you.
B001V7UXG2|4.0|Very fun series full of wicked fast (and wicked, fast) humor. The period detail is amazing, especially the whiz-bang use of that period's slang, the \\"lingo franco\\" of the day. Plus, hey, Fry and Laurie!    My only real complaint is that the farce can get repetitive, although maybe it was never intended that this entire series be viewed in one week's time. Also, minor quibble, after watching every episode, I still have no idea who some of these characters are. I am certain that more clever viewers than I will like this show all the more for knowing who's who.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Hands down this is the best show on television.  If you are tired of reality TV and want engaging characters and quality drama, action, with just the right amount of humor mixed in, then this is the series to watch. And to any critics who don't want to watch because the \\"books are better\\" I will add that yes, the books are out of this world. But I give the writers of this series all the credit in the world for sticking to the heart of the books and the characters, while at the same time coming up with twists that are unique and distinctive, and of their own quality, and plots that I think would make Mr. Goodkind proud.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|Slumdog Millionaire has been criticized by some reviewers as being unbelievable, but I've always believed in the ability of movies to help people escape for that hour and a half or two hours. The story revolves around an impoverished and uneducated Indian man who is one question away from winning the Indian equivalent of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. First he is captured by police forces who simply cannot believe that this impoverished man is one question away from winning the ultimate prize. This leads the viewer on a back-tracking whirlwind through the life of this man through his childhood, the formation of the three Musketeers with his childhood friend Salim and his eventual love interest. Jamal and Salim eventual take off, leaving Latika to become an exotic dancer known as Cherry until the two friends retain to rescue their Third Musketeer.     Eventually Salim turns on Jamal to become a hired gunmen for an Indian muscle-man ejecting Jamal from his life and separating him from Latika once again. The style of this movie is a bit bothersome for me because it comes across as an our and half period of flashback ended with a half an hour of present time period action. There had to have been a better way to do it than just stuff that felt like constant flashback. Still I can't complain about the cinematography because they made India look at once bright, beautiful, and hopeful through colors, but yet dangerous through the blacks, whites, and grays of thug life and things lost. At the end, the viewer is confronted with the classic message that there are some things more important than money.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Lost, in my mind, is the best show ever! Nothing comes close.  Yes, the writer's left some mysteries unexplained but there is a reason and a purpose for that.  How can they explain everything when everything around them is chaniging (ie, Walt was a young and small when they started filming - now he's like 6+ feet tall)?    I really enjoyed season 6 - especially \\"The End\\". That episode wrapped up everything for me. Watching the season again now I am picking up more things I missed in the 1st viewing.  I think many of the cast should be up for Emmy's especially - Matthew Fox and Terry O'quinn.

031606792X|4.0|I just finished reading this book. I have read all the books in this series now. I am 57 and completely enjoyed this series. They are not just for teens. This book was a bit too long however. I started losing interest three quarters into it. Maybe someone can explain this to me. Vampires are not supposed to be in the sunlight. That is how Edward planned to take his own life, by stepping out into the sunlight in Italy. But in other sections of the book the vampires are out in the daylight. Bella talked about how the sunlight glistened off their pale skin. Is it because they are in Washington state where it is cloudy and rainy most of the time and the sunlight is not that strong. I don't know. It confused and frustrated me. Can any fans out there clarify this for me?
B000003BDJ|4.0|So far I'm just listening to the 1st disc.  It's pretty good, but I just really like two songs--\\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Paint It Black\\".  I would've preferred to buy just a one disc CD but there were none with these two songs.  Overall, a good buy.

B000001DV2|2.0|Steve Clark's tragic death didn't seem to affect the Leps that much since what you get here is basically a remake of the multi platinum Hysteria formula but with slightly less convincing songs this time. As commendable as this band's effort was on delivering a record after loosing their main riff writer, I just couldn't get myself to even remotely like this album, since when this came out, being a struggling 20 year old college sophomore I had simply outgrown Def Leppard's musical appeal. Looking back, it becomes painfully clear how timing is everything in the music business. Despite strong initial sales there was no way Adrenalize could've matched Hysteria's success simply because the legions of teenagers that embraced the latter in 1988 were on a completely different headspace when the former was released in 1992, and after Nirvana's runaway success in late 1991 there was no chance that a younger replacement audience would embrace the band's teeny-bopping pop metal sound. In short, if you liked Hysteria, you'll probably like Adrenalize too, despite that inevitable d&eacute;j&agrave; vu feeling you'll get after giving the latter a few spins.
0439680093|3.0|I read this book with my 9 year old son.  He seemed to like it more than I did -- which may be all that matters -- but I thought it so-so.  The beginning and middle of the book were excellent, exciting.  Brief violence at the beginning was somewhat dark for a 9 year old, -- it was in a very real setting, but my son was OK.  Then the boy in the story, Matt, gets sent somewhere and mysterious things happen -- all very good and extremely interesting.  Really loved it to this point.  You care about the main character, root for him, and wonder where the story is going.  I was hooked.  But the last 1/3, and I'll try to avoid spoiling (I don't think I do since the Gatekeepers series is about five young people who must 'save the world') I thought weak and worthy of B-script horror movies.  Matt realizes he has special powers and after that it is all over for the bad folk (even if they have their own powers).  Nothing intellectual about their defeat, they are no match for Matt.  No inner journey -- except, \\"I've got the power\\".  It became hackneyed and if I'm going to get hackneyed I prefer the Star Wars/Karate Kid type story, where the hero at least needs to work at it and needs a little help from friends (Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jackie Chen/Pat Morita).  And what is borrowed in the last 1/3 of Raven's Gate isn't done as well as it was done originally (the museum scene in Raven's Gate is part Jurassic Park, part, \\"Night at the Museum.\\")<br /><br />Would have given 2/3 of the book 5 stars, but overall this book just not in league with some others we've read (again I read with my 9 year old son):  Kenneth Oppel's Airborn and Skybreaker books, Eoin Colfer's Airman, Brian Jacques Redwall series, J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, Rick Riordan's The Lightning Thief series, or Dave Barry's Peter and the Starcatchers.  So 3 stars.

B000001FKY|4.0|If you were a fifteen year old teenager in 1988 like me, there's no way you could've escaped this record, since its seven (yes, seven!) singles were a constant presence on radio and MTV and everybody around you seemed to have this album on cassette. Songs like Animal, Pour Some Sugar on Me, Love Bites, Armageddon It, Rocket and Hysteria are indelibly associated to my teenage memories of cruising around with my buddies, high school dances and first kisses, so I find it really hard to asses this music objectively even if I was never a big Def Leppard fan since back in the early-to-mid 80s, my metal flame was ignited by US based MTV bands like M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e, Quiet Riot, Twisted Sister and Ratt, and at this point I was burnt out by hair metal and fully immersed into thrash.<br />So, after doing my best in separating the music from the memories it brings, what I have is a bunch of outstanding pop metal songs (without question, Animal, Pour Some Sugar on Me, Armageddon It and Hysteria are four of the best tracks ever written in that style, and both Run Riot and Love and Affection could've easily been hit singles at the time) that sound incredibly sterile and artificial. From a studio tech point of view, Mutt Lange's production is an amazing achievement, since this record managed to sound equally great on any equipment available at the time, from crappy walkmans to cheap boom boxes to audiophile turntables and CD players but on the other hand, the overall perfection, product of painstaking recording and over the top multi tracking robs the music of any spontaneity and eventually makes it bland and soulless.<br />Strangely enough, the electric drums Rick Allen had to adopt after his tragic car accident (kudos to him for overcoming his disability and to the band for standing behind him) don't sound really that artificial, since the drumming in Pyromania wasn't that live sounding to begin with. Rick Savage's bass feels so unnaturally punchy that I find it hard to believe his lines weren't sequenced, and the distorted guitar tone is so warm, fuzzy and compressed that it lacks even the slightest edge or bite and in some spots gets buried by annoying synth tracks. That in itself is not exactly a problem since after Slippery When Wet's success, most pop metal bands were aiming for the widest crossover potential and recorded their guitars with a lightly-overdriven, reverb-drenched tone, what happens is that the sheer amount of overdubs make it almost impossible to appreciate Steve Clark's riffs and Phil Collen's playing. Finally, Joe Elliot's vocals have so many effects on them that it manages to sound both robotic and emasculated while the dozens of vocal tracks in every chorus make the hooks extremely annoying.<br />This album is such a perfect period piece that it stands as the prime example of everything that was good and bad with mid-to-late 80s radio rock: from a pop songwriter's point of view, this album is the holy grail of hooks, but at the same time, the production in it, as amazing as it may be as a technological achievement, hasn't aged that well and sounds very dated today.<br />So, in the end, reviewing this album ends up being nothing more than an exercise in futility. If you were a teen when this album was all over the airwaves you probably lost your virginity with a mix tape that had Love Bites on it, so there's no point in a recommendation since you already know what you're getting... on the other hand, if you're a bit younger, there's no way you can like it since this is exactly what Kurt Cobain rebelled against in the first place, and if you're a little older, you're better off listening to Journey anyway.eren't sequenced, and the distorted guitar tone is so warm, fuzzy and compressed that it lacks even the slightest edge or bite and in some spots gets buried by annoying synth tracks.

B000KJU1HI|5.0|Don't Look Back is one of the best music documentaries, essential for anyone even remotely interested in Bob Dylan or twentieth century music. The importance and influence of Dylan and the film itself are such that the latter is arguably essential for anyone interested in twentieth century culture period.     The film covers Dylan's legendary 1965 English tour, historically significant as his last solo acoustic outing a few months before the infamous 1965 Newport Folk Festival electric set and subsequent tours with The Band. Anyone curious about his artistic progression, especially onstage, will be fascinated. Yet this is no concert film. We see various songs from various shows - all immaculately performed and most of it impeccably filmed -, but none are complete, and there is even some repetition; anyone expecting a performance video will be disappointed. What we get instead is one of the first cinema verite examples; the black and white footage of director D. A. Pennebaker and his small staff - captured with a few of the first portable, high quality cameras - was extremely influential. It offered unprecedented intimacy, showing a high profile artist/celebrity in situations the public could not have imagined previously:  in hotel rooms, backstage, in cars, etc. Such things are now clichéd, but this is essentially where it began. The movie shows sides of Dylan that few could ever have hoped to see and that most people likely never even imagined. Some are revelatory, such as a casual Hank Williams singalong; others are less than flattering, but all are interesting. We also get tantalizing glimpses of contemporaries like Allen Ginsberg, Joan Baez, Bob Neuwirth, etc. The most engrossing scene has Dylan working out a new song at the piano; one hardly ever sees a great work in creation, and this is worth the price of Don't by itself. Even those uninterested in Dylan will find much to like, as Don't gives a very good idea of how those on the mid-1960s zeitgeist acted, talked, and dressed. Also intriguing is the insight into how a popular concert of the time looked onstage and off.    Great as the film is, we must be careful not to take it as definitive. Dylan dislikes it, and it is easy to see why; he comes off as arrogant and portentous despite an always mesmerizing presence and spellbinding performances. His love of verbal dueling is clear, and it can be entertaining to watch him spar with the pretentious, presumptuous, and ignorant. However, it is hard not to sometimes feel sorry for his clearly surprised and occasionally unoffending victims and hard to admire his character as it appears here. His attitude is understandable to a significant degree; it would be hard not to tire of the same questions over and over, annoying faux-fans, etc., and his reactions are at least more lively and creative than most. We also must not forget that Dylan was after all very young and so wrapped up in prolific creative brilliance that it is remarkable he even had time for anything else. As for his claim that Pennebaker's selective footage gives a distinctly misleading impression, perhaps intentionally, we cannot know, but it may well be true. Don't is invaluable in any case, a warts and all peek at one of the twentieth century's greatest artists at a crucial time; no one with even the slightest interest in the subject or era can fail to watch it.
0061537969|5.0|I don't necessarily know why, but when I first read the title of this book, and found out it was being told from the point of view of the dog, for some reason I thought that \\"racing in the rain\\" meant the dog physically enjoyed racing in the rain, not that the dog learned from his master about racing a car in the rain, so uh, that was amusing for me. I'm glad that this book doesn't have to be for people that even care about racing, Enzo does bring it up a lot, but as someone who doesn't care for racing I still never felt annoyed or bored.<br />What I felt was anger, a whole lot of it. In a good way, though, in the way that the author intends for you to feel it. I guess it's a sign of how much I cared about the characters that I constantly felt horrified at the stuff that was happening to them. I think we've all had moments in our lives where we're going through hard times and we're left thinking, \\"Could this possibly get worse?\\" For the characters in this book, it totally does, and I kept cringing every time something new was about to revealed. What's so great about this though, is that it sets up for a really satisfying ending.<br />Also, Enzo's inner commentary on everything that goes on now has me talking more to my pets. They, in turn, stare more when I talk. What ususally happens after that either tells me that they don't understand what I'm talking about, or that they totally understand but are choosing to ignore me. Hm.<br /><br />I want to add that my enjoyment of this book was probably greatly due to the fact that I am a huge dog lover. I don't know if it would touch people the same way if they're not as attached to dogs as I am. Regardless, it's still a good story and I believe people should give it a try whether or not they're really into canines.
1439102937|3.0|Just finished this book.  I did not enjoy it as much as \\"Everyone Worth Knowing\\".  The characters and story lines are interesting, if somewhat predictable.  The only thing that irks me with Weisberger's writing is that she gets too wordy and descriptive sometimes.  There will be like a whole page of what the character is thinking before they respond to a question.  More than once I found myself thinking, \\"Oh, get on with it!\\" and skipping ahead.  That said, it is a fun, easy read.  Definitely a good beach/vacation read.

Churchill wasn't always correct in his decisions, but his leadership is unquestionable.  The book also points up the fact of self-serving egos that make up humanity, especially in civilian and military politics.  Finally, Hastings's shows how a certain amount of luck plays into a victory or a defeat.  Well researched and well written.

I didn't even get the feeling that Mr. Larsson wrote it; it felt more like he may have outlined it and someone else finished it.  So sad because Lisbeth is one of the best characters I've come across.  My advice:  cut your losses and end with \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and let your imagination finish the story for you!

I have forgotten to put it in the truck a couple of times at the car wash and it does just fine with the soap and high pressure water.

B001GZ6QEC|4.0|We watched this over several evenings, our big screen TV fed us too many images at each sitting to watch the picture for very long at one time.  Thus, my experience of the film was discombobulated, but I realize, that's just the way it is nowadays, and partly that's due to the DVD format, which encourages pausing and exiting and resuming according to the customer's convenience.  Maybe I would have enjoyed this one more if forced to see it in one clump, but who has the time for that nowadays?  It would have struck me as crazy long.<br /><br />Christian Bale stars as Bruce Wayne, my God, I'm tired already just starting to type that sentence.  Suffice it to say that you all know most of the casting already, and since I'm a Johnny come lately to this show, most of you have seen the darn thing already.  Good, then maybe you can help me.  When Bale is playing Bruce Wayne he talks nearly normal, but when he is the Batman he adopts a deep fuzzy basso voice that makes him sounds more profound.  Is this his real voice and the Bruce Wayne one the performance?  All I could think of, in the last part of the picture when Batman's feeling sad for one reason or another (sometimes it feels like the weight of the whole world is against him) doesn't he ever just revert to his regular voice, especially when overcome by emotion the way Bale often plays it?  Just saying is all, though the switch from Katie Holmes to Maggie Gyllenhall is so startling that I, for one,was wondering why Bruce Wayne even regretted losing Rachel to Harvey Dent.  Not that Holmes is so beautiful but Maggie, well, it would be an offense to chivalry to say more.  Gyllenhall otherwise rendered a beautiful performance, and it almost seemed from reel to reel that she had not only watched, but understood, the first picture.<br /><br />The actors have gotten lots of praise in general, but most of them seemed like they were phoning it in, or playing to green screens that made them seem particularly vacant, Michael Caine.  People seem to love Gary Oldman in this, but I don't know.  As for Heath Ledger, drugs fueled his performance as the Joker, and drugs carried him off at the end, so caveat emptor.  Why is every superhero movie nowadays about public opinion?  That's what I don't understand.  Moviemakers have given us a new fictional universe in which the wants of the general populace sway every turn of the plot (Gotham citizens deciding Batman a vigilante, etc--or look at the new issues of Buffy Season Eight in which slayers are perceived as evil for some reason); this account of the way the world works has literally nothing to do with the real world, in which a handful of corporations and banks control what happens to all of us from birth to death, and that's just the way it is.  You'd think from these movies that democracy (or mob rule) really worked.o love Gary Oldman in this, but I don't know.

0439023483|3.0|As a fan of books that allow me to escape the work a day world, I had heard much about this series.  It is certainly a quick read--easily read in about six or seven hours.  The book merits special recognition for a novel plot, but I must admit that I was disappointed.  The writing was terrible, or maybe it was the editing because someone should have fixed the annoying switches between first person and third person narrative.  For example, in the first chapter, it reads \\"I prop myself up on one elbow.\\"  It seems to me properly this should have been written \\"I propped myself up on one elbow.\\"  I could have wrote this off to style, but later in the book this \\"style\\" switches between the two forms.  I find it very difficult read something from a \\"writer\\" that has such poor grammar.

B002VECMAE|4.0|THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS is a film about the New Earth Army, a special forces outfit that was formed in the late 70s to become essentially \\"Jedi Warriors.\\" They were to use the power of Mother Earth and their own innate psychic powers against the enemy in a new and non-traditional type of warfare and in essence change the world forever.  Now this might sound a little unbelievable to all you fans of Sargent Slaughter out there but that part of it is all true. There was in fact a New Earth Army formed in the very late seventies to do exactly that, and if you don't believe me you can either read the non-fiction book of the same title upon which this movie was based or watch the interviews with two of the men involved with the unit in the special features section of the DVD.  They even had some mild success killing goats with their minds. Well, one goat. it was standing next to the one they were aiming at but it still counts. Hmmm. Anyhow  I  guess even Uncle Sam was tripping out back then. Groovy, huh?<br /><br />It seems that this is the kind of movie that you either hate or you love. I'm in the love camp. I love the silliness, and I love it even more because of the reality of that silliness-- and the fact that it just breaks me up thinking about all these macho army types sitting around talking seriously about bending spoons. Those who hate the movie have one thing in common and that seems to be that the film lacks direction, it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Everyone seems to like the back-story of how the unit was formed and how they trained well enough--no problems there. But after that most people claim that it comes off the tracks. And it does. The true story of the New Earth Army lacks a satisfying dramatic arc so what's a writer to do?  In this case he seems to have decided to tell the story of how a reporter became a Jedi Warrior. But he told it in such a loose manner that some of his audience was  unaware of it and others didn't get it at all.<br /><br/>I've thought about this for a while and I think I've figured out where the movie went wrong and unfortunately what ruined it for these many is also one of the most brilliant things about the film. How's that for a dichotomy?You see somewhere along the line (probably quite early) someone said \\" We should get Ewan McGregor! Who would make a better Jedi Warrior?\\" Perfect casting, a brilliant idea. The audience would love it, and they did love it. Except for the ones who hated it.<br /><br />Maybe the Coen Brothers should have made this film.<br /><br />HYPE FACTOR: Very High...second viewing necessary
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was a little wary wondering how much of an impact not having the music would have on Daria. It was the show I watched while in high school and found myself relating to back then. I have to say, even without the music (Which IMO is hardly noticeable unless your watching it FOR the music) it's still the same awesome Daria it always was. My husband and I are enjoying the collection a lot, if for nothing else than it's nostalgia.     The resolution is great. The extras are good. And it's wonderful having it all in one easy to store collection. It could have been handled a lot worse (Releasing one disc at a time, costing a fortune, no extras/bare bones) but it wasn't. As for the music, well...blame licensing and copyright laws that are out-dated and the people who sue and barter just to make a bigger buck.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|The story continues!  In Suites II and III, Janelle Monae takes us deeper into the \\"Self-Realization\\" of her alter-ego, Cindy Mayweather, and challenges us to use our own imagination and emotion to accomplish our own \\"self-realization\\".    With poetically inspiring lyrics, hip-hop infused, funked out beats, and symphonic variations on a theme, Archandroid seemlessly takes you on a trip though the musical mind.  I always find that when I introduce \\"hip-hop heads\\" to Janelle, they all say she's \\"different\\".  But I beg those hard core heads to try Janelle out..if you can't grasp her at first, she'll definitely grow on you.  The same goes for my R&B, Neo-Soul, Rock, and Pop heads.  Monae is such a weird blend of all of these genres, that there is sure to be at least 2 tracks that will have you comin' back for more.    That being said, buy the album.  You won't be disappointed, and at under $15, even if you are totally disgusted, you're wallet won't be.  If you like what you hear, she's got more on the way.  If you love it, you'll be one of many who own a piece of a die-hard music collector's  masterpiece.
159448385X|4.0|Did you think The Kite Runner was an amazing book? Do you feel like it was one worth taking the time to read? Well, you're in for yet another surprise! Khaled Hosseini recently came out with a book similar to The Kite Runner called, A Thousand Splendid Suns. This book will almost bring tears into your eyes and at times, make your jaw drop in astonishment and utter shock. A Thousand Splendid Suns can be claimed a worthy novel due to its powerful emotions, descriptive actions, and connection to history.  The novel contains many strong emotions that the reader can imagine. My heart wanted to comfort Mariam when Jalil betrays her and treats her as if she wasn't even his own daughter. The way Hosseini portrays Mariam's character, a young girl who is merely a product of a mistake, truly conveys the role of women in Afghanistan during the time period. I wanted to take Mariam and provide her with a real home as opposed to the \\"home\\" she is thrown in through Jalil. I could feel the brutal hits from Rasheed that Mariam got. It was almost as if the hits were on my skin. Through this novel, the strong oppression of women is seen. The audience can feel what emotions were like for people in Afghanistan in the worst situations. Many people blame a whole country or race for attacking the U.S, however, it is only a certain group that makes other countries along with the people of their own suffer and go through extreme brutality.
B002BWP4A6|5.0|Strange \\"accidents\\" and crimes occur in a small farming village in Northern Germany on the eve of World War I.  As the incidents escalate, dark secrets of the seemingly peaceful Protestant community are revealed, and the local schoolteacher begins to believe that his students might be responsible for these malevolent events.<br /><br />The children of this German village are members of the generation who grew up to embrace Nazism.  Their seemingly passive community is, in fact, a cruel, authoritarian society, primarily controlled by the local Baron, who employs half of its citizens, and the seemingly unfeeling minister.<br /><br />Bitterness proliferates among the powerless, particularly its young people, which makes them the prime suspects when the terrible events begin to take place.<br /><br />On the other hand, as we learn more about the individuals in this village, one begins to wonder if a single person or group is committing these various brutal crimes, or if they are totally unrelated.  Virtually everybody seems to have a malicious motive.<br /><br />All of the performances are exquisite; the actors, totally unknown to this writer, appear to have stepped out of early 20th century photographs of rural European life.<br /><br />Like he did with his 2004 thriller, CACHE, director Michael Haneke presents us with an engrossing, deliberately paced mystery, yet he does not give us a precise solution to the enigma.  Clues abound, but at film's end, it is up to the viewer to put the puzzle pieces together...if he can.<br /><br />THE WHITE RIBBON is perhaps the richest-looking black-and-white film to come along since color movies became the norm, which is certainly why the cinematography was Oscar-nominated.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B001DF68MA|5.0|I did a lot of research trying to find a system that would work well for our family. I have a 30 pound almost-3-year-old daughter and a 20 pound 14 month old son. We have a bike trailer that was given to us but I am not comfortable pulling it because I can't SEE them, and because I have heard so much about the weight being a strain if you aren't an avid biker. It needs a few repairs and I wasn't keen on paying for them if i wasn't going to use it. I decided on a front mounted bike seat but was really nervous, because I haven't ridden a bike in several years. I had just purchased a brand new Nirve Cruiser for myself (it's GORGEOUS!) and I wanted something that would fit well, be secure, attractive, and able to be removed if necessary. The Wee Ride line fit the bill and was nicely reviewed. I was really on the fence because I didn't think I really NEEDED the LTD model (extra padding, etc) but I could NOT see putting a red and black model on my pretty new leopard print bike. So I sprung for the LTD model.<br /><br />When the item arrived it was well packaged and I was so excited. Minimal Assembly was necessary (adding the headrest/handrest to the seat) and then I was able to install it on my bike. I installed it in the front yard while watching both kids. It wasn't terribly complicated, but the hardest part was installing it without causing any damage to my current paint job on the bike. I did get one knick near the headstock. I had to use the bolts for the oversize headstock, and it was difficult to get the brackets on as the cruiser has a VERY short headstock. At first I was really worried that it wasn't going to fit, but it was fine. The bracket is VERY secure. I almost had to remove the front basket to get the bracket on. I will let you know right now that there is no way I will be taking that bracket off my bike anytime soon. PROBABLY never. LOL. It would be a huge hassle. I am happy that they offer extra bars for purchase if you want to switch the seat to anotherbike. However, when attaching the seat to the bar (with just one hand-tightened bolt with a large plastic knob to turn) I had a very hard time getting it to line up and attach right. Once I got it, I also decided that I wouldn't be unscrewing the seat if I could help it. You are able to adjust the distance the seat is from your own bike seat, and I moved mine as close to my handlebars as possible, because I really wanted as much leg room for myself as possible. I have a \\"cupholder\\" style drink holder on my handlebars, and I had to turn it around so that it is INSIDE the front basket, or the seat wouldn't fit at all. the cupholder is still not usable when I have the seat attached, which is a bummer, because the seat's headrest/handrest covers it completely.<br /><br />I was nervous about riding, and the weight distribution, so I tried it with no kids first. It was so simple! I barely had to alter my pedaling. I was impressed. I put my older and heavier child in it first. The ride was a breeze. At first I thought that she was \\"leaning\\" back and forth as I was pedaling (side to side leaning) and I asked her to stop because it made things a bit wobbly, but I still didn't really feel \\"unsafe.\\" As soon as she stopped, it was a perfect ride. She loved being able to see what I see, and point things out to me. It was a totally new experience for both of us, and we LOVED it. I went for a ride that was twice as long as I usually do, and longer than I ever anticipated I would go with a her, especially the first time! When we got home, I switched and took my son, who is younger and 10 pounds lighter. I noticed right away that the \\"leaning\\" sensation was worse with him. It wasn't because they were intentionally leaning, but it was because he didn't have as good of control of his center of gravity, and his body rocked back and forth with my pedaling. Eventually he got the hang of it and both of them seem to be able to sit more still in the seat. He also loved the ride. I had beenmildly concerned about them keeping their hands off the brakes and handlebars while riding. I had no issues with my daughter and almost none with my son. They loved the handrest and it is just perfectly positioned.<br /><br />The only effect I noticed on myself, was that the wider pedaling action, though not really noticeable while riding, did make my butt a little sore afterward. Like different muscles were being used and my butt was not in as good of contact with the seat as it is without the WeeRide installed. Keep in mind I have a large Cruiser style seat. This is SUCH a cool product. We are ordering a second one so that my husband can put one on his bike and we can ALL ride together! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Please see my uploaded photos on the product page to see what the seat looks like :)

B002ZG983M|5.0|The funny thing about how this movie got me is that my pre-teen nephews   were dying to go see it and begged me to take them when I had them   over one weekend! If it weren't for that, I would've surely skipped   over this one, but boy I'm glad I didn't now!  (-:   Of course, the whole premise, if you are a person who just breaks  everything down in logical and concrete terms and lack a sense of humor  will seem ridiculous to you. But this is one of these films where you  abandon all that and just take the journey with the story to a heightened reality.  Then you'll get completely swept up in it and you'll see what I mean when I say  that it's so ridiculous that you'll love it! (-:  It's funny, it's dark, their are poignant moments too...a very unique film.  I loved all the performances in this film...Nick Cage (Big Daddy),   Mark Strong, everybody!   Of course the girl superhero (Hit-Girl) does steal   many of the scenes in the film, but I liked KICKASS himself, Aaron Johnson, as well.  The awkward, otherwise nerdy outcast kid, who shows an inner strength  and inner beauty that inspires others in his community who would otherwise  mock him to find their own inner superheroes to effect change is the underlying   message of this film without being preachy about it.  The production, direction and story were all well done, but what would  you expect when you have Brad Pitt's PLAN B productions at the helm!  When I saw him showing up to promos and opening nights for this movie  on Entertainment Tonight, that should've been a tip off for me!  There's no way that a star of his stature would affiliate himself  with a project like this unless he thought it was good.  Like I said, give it a chance and it will get you!  KICKASS does just that!----Kicks ass! (-:

He is able to go undetected all over North America using aliases, disguises and stolen identities. He has a carefully crafted plan that involves an automatic firing weapon controlled remotely via a laptop. Bruce Willis plays a very believable villain.    However, the ending was so bad that the whole plot blows up like a poorly made B-movie! Unfortunately, it makes the two hours not worth watching!
0307463745|5.0|Jason Fried changed the way I think about the actual way I run a business. Most books are great at talking about concepts, not so great at helping you understand application. Rework is all about execution. After reading it, I really do believe these are things their team learned from starting a business, not just thinking about one or studying others.    Highly recommended for anyone in any sort of organization.

1580176941|4.0|These authors did their homework and put together a great collection of the best tried and true decorating and baking techniques. I'm a huge Martha Stewart and Food Network fan, and I've read or seen my share of commentary on sugar cookie \\"best practices\\" that seem to contradict what you've heard in other books and magazines (e.g., stick cookies in the freezer before baking / pop them immediately in the oven; only use Silpats to evenly bake your cookies / Silpats aren't worth the money; cool cookies on the tray to avoid breaking / remove immediately to avoid burning).  What this book does differently is that it explains why something works for them and yet also acknowledges that the authors have tried other equipment or methods you may have heard of and tells you why they feel their method is the best.  I love the no nonsense and to the point commentary in each section that explains their point of view (e.g., when to use wax paper vs. parchment paper, what are the best types of cooling racks, how can you safely remove intricately-shaped cookies, how long baking prep should take).  They've organized their tips into super-helpful tables and checklists, and also provide tips on how to cut down on prep time.  I would have liked to give this one 4 1/2 stars.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't think designs and decorating techniques are as strong as the baking tips sections. Some of the designs are gorgeous (e.g., winter, Valentine's) while others seem very basic (1 or 2 colors, basic decoration) or are poorly executed (uneven piping) in the photographs(e.g., New Year's, Christmas).  You also have to remember that this book covers decorating essentially one type of cookie --- you're not meant to get a bunch of great recipes or varied ingredients or flavors in this book.

B00009RGBS|5.0|This is a captivating movie derived from the long running Broadway musical of the same name. The musical was based on a book by Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse and was choreographed by Fosse. Fosse's next film project was to have been to make the musical into a movie, but he died before the project was begun, which shelved the project. Rob Marshall revived interest in the film project with his idea of casting the events of the film through the eyes of Roxie Hart. We can be glad that the film project was revived, because Rob Marshall has created a truly wonderful movie. What a talented cast!! Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and John C. Reilly all dance, sing, and act extremely well. The dance numbers preserve the Fosse imprint of the musical. This is an exceptionally entertaining film that you will long remember.
193413712X|5.0|Olive Kittridge by Elizabeth Strout won the Pulitzer a year or 2 ago. Since then, I've not come upon a book to rival it, until the latest Pulitzer: tinkers, by Paul Harding. Although the writing is beautifully poetic, it is the story of a man on his death bed and his father, plagued by epilepsy, that resonates and moves the reader on. The story of George's dying is interspersed with metaphysical musings from clock work books and journal entries of an impersonal, collective consciousness nature. Tinkers is meditative, moving, sublime. The Pulitzer seems to be the source these days for truly great literature. Thank you, Pulitzer, for bringing this overlooked book from an indie publisher (Bellevue Literary Press) to our attention.
B00133KFGW|5.0|The parallels between this movie and Oliver, which have been pointed out by other reviewers, in no way detracts from the charm of this movie. The story of a young boy who has been left to his own resources, and discovers a haven called music is inspiring and dramatic; I can most specifically relate to using music has a source of hope and promise as a boy!<br /><br />The story proceeds with a series of flashbacks that explain how the situation developed that put our talented hero in an orphanage. His love of music, which was strictly generated within him, serves as a focal point for living that helps compensate for the difficulties which life has placed before him.<br /><br />August is blessed with a remarkable talent for music that places him in the child prodigy category. Having no one that cares enough to help him, he must find music in all that surrounds him; as he listens to the ordinary sounds of life he translates that into music in his mind.<br /><br />A basic part of his belief system is a complete, unshakable confidence that his parents love him and want him back. This notion is ridiculed by the other boys in the orphanage but his confidence is not compromised by that.<br /><br />The story takes a big turn when August, who is actually named Evan Taylor, decides to follow the music and finds himself in the totally strange surroundings of New York City. This is where a boy street musician, the \\"Artful Dodger\\" character, befriends him and takes him to meet the \\"Fagin\\" character who in this story is called The Wizard, very well played by Robin Williams.<br /><br />The pace of the story picks up from this point onward; the lives of all three, the mother, Lyla, played by Keri Russell, the father, Louis, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and the son, August/Evan, played by Freddie Highmore are being drawn together by their shared love of music. I will only say that the ending does not disappoint!<br /><br />The copy we watched last night was loaned to us by a friend; I placed an order for a copy of our own this morning with Amazon. I'm already looking forward to seeing it again. By the way, the sound on the disc is very good; there are instrumental solos including a pipe organ that sound fabulous, as well as an unusual blending of rock and classical music used to show the dramatically different lives lead by Lyla and Louis.<br /><br />We thoroughly enjoyed the movie and found it captivating!morning with Amazon.

B002HREKCI|5.0|I waited entirely too long to read this book.  I'm not sure if it was the serious issues I could tell this book was about from the summary that made me hesitate, or if my TBR list was just growing too long or what?  But I waited too long and I'm sorry for that.  All I can say to those of you out there who haven't read Thirteen Reasons Why, is to go out right now and get yourself a copy and start reading.  I'm in love with Jay Asher's writing.  To be honest, I thought I was a part of this book.  Not just reading the words and turning the pages, but I felt like I could hear Hannah's words for myself, and see the places on the map that Clay was visiting for myself.  Asher is that talented, he takes you inside his writing and does not let go.  As Clay listens to Hannah's story he decides he won't be able to take breaks or spread the stories out.  It's almost like ripping off a band aid - you just have to get it over with.  Not just so he can find out how he played a role in the grand scheme of things, but because he needs closure and the it's the type that can only come from knowing the whole story.  I was right there with Clay, I couldn't stop reading, I just had to get the full story.    This is not a light read, I found no humor within these pages and yet I couldn't, and didn't want to stop reading.  Even now, I'm finished and yet still Hannah and Clay are with me.  I think Thirteen Reasons Why will be sticking with me for a very long time.  I'm not usually one for books with strong morals being forced on readers, or lectures about lessons to be learned, but this was different.  Asher made me look at things in new ways and I'm not sure you can go back after something like that.  I learned a valuable lesson from this book and I'm grateful for that.  Clay says in the beginning of the book that he'll never be able to get Hannah's voice out of his head, and to be honest I don't think I will either.    This story was amazing.  It was emotional and heavy, but also moving and beyond memorable.  I feel grateful to have read this book and cannot say nearly enough about how highly I think of Asher's writing and technique and his amazing gift for story telling.  I may not be able to look back at this book and want to re-read it over and over again, it's just not that type of book.  But I also can't bear to part with it.  I'm not sure I'll ever read another that can even come close to being it's equal.  I will never forget Hannah's story.

B001PO53IO|5.0|I'm not a Star Wars nerd but I really enjoy watching this more adult oriented, CGI animated Star Wars series.  The show has a more serious tone with some humor mixed in. My thoughts below:    GOOD    1 - The special effects and sound are awesome, especially on blu-ray  2 - The freedom the show has to come up with different characters, monsters, weapons and locations to keep everything fresh instead of being locked into a story like the prequel movies were   3 - Great value, I paid $32.99 for 22 episodes then proceeded to watch them all over one weekend, now I need to catch up to Season 2  4 - The voice acting is very good    BAD    1 - The enemy needs smarter, more accurate droids since they couldn't hit Jabba the Hutt if he was sitting in front of them plus the Jedi seem to slice and dice them like a Ginsu 3000    UGLY    1 - Jar Jar Binks, he shouldn't have been in the movies and he definitely shouldn't be in this show  2 - The packaging, the third disc is halfway under the second disc which makes it very hard to remove and put back.  I'm sure if they can put all that money into the show, they could hire someone to figure out a little better scheme for the discs    It's a great show and I was happy to hear it has been renewed for Season 3 starting in October 2010, which is when Season 2 will be released on DVD and Blu-ray.
0385334206|5.0|There were multiple times that I broke out in hysterical laughter with this book. There were just a few times that I experienced intense feelings of 'pissed off.' And so on. This book was highly enjoyable and gave an incredibly satirical look at Western culture (Mainly the US). Vonnegut is witty, rye, matter-of-fact. The detached perspective of the author included in this book gives a fresh meaning to the subjects he is writing about, and his use of words is entrancing in a way that lets the reader know that this book was written to show the problems and issues that are so prevalent in America. He even has the most descriptive ways to explain such atrocities. Vonnegut tackles the issues of now in a painful way, showing us how the truth about ourselves can be just as disgusting as the Creator of the Universe saw things in his own book.  In a way, it shows the reader the relationship of author/character is a story. That with fiction, anything is possible, and including some of real life into it, makes the reader think more in depth about the way they live their life.<br /><br />My new favorite Vonnegut book. Even ahead of Galapagos, and Hocus Pocus!<br /><br />ETC.

B001TI7DG6|3.0|This book was for a small local discussion group.      The read was engaging and our subsequent group discussion went in many intriguing directions:religion/spirituality vs. dogma, imagination, willingness to suspend belief, storytelling.  \\"The Life of Pi\\" is worth reading as it certainly is a well-told story.    If anyone can explain \\"the island\\", my book group would really appreciate some closure there.

This is a very great story of love and I think actually, we really need this kind of movie.<br />I'm recommending it for all who have fed up with violence, computer graphic movie, plastic monster and stupid scenario.
B000000HX0|5.0|...a Stanton 681 MKIII and an Audio Technica 440MLA.  This one gets the Stanton every time.  Why?  Because of the acoustic dynamics and the deep bass.  Sure, the AT tracks better, but the Stanton gives this album the \\"classic rock\\" sound it well deserves: deep bass, warm mids and soaring highs.  The album is definitely one of the better 180 gram remasters out there.  If you grew up with \\"Siamese Dream\\" as I did, do not hesitate and get this classic on vinyl.
0446569895|5.0|I've always liked Ozzy, but I thought, \\"Oh man, he's writing a book?  It's probably gonna be a mess!\\"  I'm happy to say he proved me wrong.  \\"I Am Ozzy\\"  is one of the best books I've read in a long time!  It's interesting to see how he and Sharon remember things a little differntly, but as Ozzy says, he was wasted most of the time.  What really surprised me about the book was how much I laughed!  I laughed till I cried!  Sharon is always saying Ozzy is a funny man, and he sure is in this book!  If you love Ozzy, or even just like Ozzy, this book is worth your time to read.  There are a few other subjects I wish he would have talked about more in depth, but maybe he's just saving it for book number 2?!  Go OZ!!!!!
B003HE2B6C|5.0|I love that the album came out just in time for summer...I can't wait to hear them play these songs in concert next month!    My current favorite song is \\"Give A Little\\", but I love pretty much all the songs equally.

B0007LXPBI|2.0|STILL WAITING FOR RESPONSE FROM SELLER.... GOT CHARGED FOR THIS BUT DID NOT RECEIVE IT.
B000001FYL|5.0|I just discovered Bon Jovi in the last month, and just in the last month realized that I did not know what it was like to feel truly connected to a song or an artist. I now own 10 Bon Jovi albums, including this one, and love every single one of them -- the band is fantastic, but there is something special about this solo album. No one should be allowed to put as much heart and soul into anything as Jon Bon Jovi puts into these songs. He shows that he is a brilliant lyricist and vocalist in all of his albums, but takes both his lyrics and vocals to an entirely new level here. The only band album that compares to this one as far as being deep, raw, and personal is These Days.     Standout songs for me:    \\"Santa Fe\\" - the most searing, devastating, excruciatingly beautiful song every written or sung. Jon's vocals alone will rock your world, and are combined with the most penetrating lyrics imaginable -- if this song does not leave you shattered then you are probably made of steel. You will feel the blood and sweat and tears that I can only imagine Jon must have shed writing and performing this song.     \\"Miracle\\" - beware, this song will sneak up on you. It has a deceptively light, salsa type of feel, but packs a huge punch. Just listen to the lyrics and Jon's voice and don't be deceived by the \\"your savior has just left town\\" -- this is song is upbeat and powerful and quirkily encouraging, you'll listen to it over and over again trying to put your finger on its charm.     \\"Dyin' Ain't Much of a Livin'\\" - another hard hitter that will probably leave you on your knees, don't let the sedate tempo fool you. Jon can put a gravelly sob in his voice that leaves you tingling all over and completely heart-broken, have the tissues on hand.     \\"Never Say Die\\" - deceptively fun, upbeat rock style tune. Listen to the lyrics again, deep stuff. I never thought rock, even with a western flavor, could have so much power to touch.     \\"Blaze of Glory\\" - I can't say anything about this song that hasn't already been said. Deserves to be the title track and one of his biggest hits.     \\"Blood Money\\" - love, love the simple, bare-bones arrangement of this song. Short, thoughtful, all about Jon's voice, which really stands out.      I have left out alot of tracks -- but every track on this albums is worth listening to. If more people put this much of themselves into whatever they did the world would be a vastly different and probably much better place. Another reviewer describes Jon's singing on this album as \\"bleeding his heart out in every lyric\\" and I could not come up with a better description. If you love Bon Jovi, if you hate Bon Jovi, if you are alive... buy this album and prepare to be touched in a very raw, gritty, personal, authentic way. You will never listen to music the same again -- you might never be the same again.
B002M9FWQE|5.0|It's the first time in a long time that I purchase a CD in which I like more than two or three songs. In fact, I bought both of Mika's CDs, and I love them. They are upbeat, they put me in a good mood, and make me smile.

B000002I7R|5.0|This CD is one of Plant's best ever.  Yes, that includes his Led Zeppelin stuff, too.  The band does an excellent job also, especially the guitarist, Robbie Blunt.  Most of the songs on this CD have a definite Zeppelin feel to them.  While Plant would produce a few more solo albums, this one, his first, is the best in my opinion.

0071636080|5.0|[[ASIN:0071636080 The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs: How to Be Insanely Great in Front of Any Audience]]    Book Review by Richard L. Weaver II, Ph.D.    This Just as television stations admit their affiliation prior to any review or evaluation they make of a show or product that is produced by their parent company, I have to confess that I am a McGraw-Hill author, and this is a McGraw-Hill product; however, I did not know that until I opened the book to its title page.  (I confess, tongue-securely-placed-in-cheek, that it will be impossible for me to give this book a fair, impartial, and totally honest review!)  Am I biased by my 24-year history of working with McGraw-Hill?  Yes.  Am I biased by my excellent relationships established with the editors who have worked with me throughout this period of time?  Yes. ----but, I am going to continue none-the-less.    Anyone who knows my background knows that I have written more than a half-dozen different college textbooks on the subject of public communication, and my most recent textbook, Communicating Effectively (McGraw-Hill, 2009) (with Saundra Hybels) is currently going into its tenth edition. Half this textbook is devoted to public speaking; it is the section I always wrote even when Hybels was alive (she died in 1999).  My small (Elements of Style-like) book, Public Speaking Rules: All you need for a GREAT speech! (And Then Some Publishing, 2008), available from Amazon.com, covers all the essential information speakers need.  All this to say, is it any wonder I would be interested in this book by Carmine Gallo?    If you are an experienced speaker or you have read a great deal about public speaking, you are unlikely to find anything new in this book; however, if you want to remind yourself about what it takes to be a great speaker or you just want to polish and hone your skills, then this is just the book.  It is informative, specific, comprehensive, well-written, and complete with wonderful, engaging examples.    Gallo has structured her book much like one of Steve Jobs' presentations.  That is, she has kept her chapters brief (\\"Obey the Ten-Minute Rule\\"--Intermission 1), includes brief summaries at the end of every chapter (\\"Director's Notes\\"), offers short segments within chapters, provides tables, bullet-pointed lists, includes numbers of additional examples (\\"Share the Stage\\"--Act II, Scene 11), injects pictures of Jobs at work, begins every chapter with a summary quotation, and furnishes additional quotations, explanations, and stories set aside by brackets (much as my \\"Consider This\\" sections in Communicating Effectively).  There are a sufficient number of things going on that Gallo effectively grabs a reader's attention, and rivets it to the printed page.    Gallo writes about the passion that drove her to write this book: \\"The purpose of this book is to help you capture that passion [the passion that drives us] and turn it into a story so mesmerizing that people will want to help you achieve your vision\\" (p. xvii).  She added, \\"Do not let your ideas die because you failed to present them in a way that sparked the imagination of your listeners.  Use Jobs's techniques to reach the hearts and minds of everyone you hope to influence\\" (p. xvii).    If you want a great book on presentational skills, you can't do better than this one!
B003INBNXO|5.0|In the tradition of Jet Li's \\"Fearless\\" and \\"Fist of Legend\\", comes the fourth collaboration between the Wilson Yip-Donnie Yen tag team who also brought us the phenomenal \\"Shah Po Lang\\" in 2005. \\"IP MAN\\" is based on the life of the man responsible for making the Chinese kung fu style of \\"Wing Chun\\" (invented by a woman), which is up to this day, is among China's most revered style. Yes, Ip Man is also the man who has a huge number of talented disciples--most notably, the late great Bruce Lee.<br /><br />In the 1930's, the Chinese province of Fo Shan is a thriving place of martial arts schools, with various sects of different styles. Fo Shan is said to be the place where the famous Wong Fei Hung learned his art and therefore this place has a reputation. Ip Man (Donnie Yen) is a very accomplished martial artist but he keeps to himself, maintains a low profile and quietly spars with friends at home. But after an acknowledged victory over a fighter from the Northern quarter, Master Jin (Fan Siu Wong), Ip Man becomes an instant hero in Fo Shan.<br /><br />Time passes and in the late 1930's, following the Japanese invasion, Ip Man's property was confiscated by the Japanese army and his family is forced to live an abject existence. One day, general Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), a fanatical practitioner in Karate, witnesses the skills of this Wing Chun master. The general becomes obsessed with Ip man, and demands that the Chinese style of Wing Chun be taught to the Japanese army. But Ip man refuses and instead challenges Miura to a duel. Ip Man has to uphold the benevolence of his art and protect Chinese dignity. The battle for national pride is about to begin....<br /><br />The one thing I know for sure is that Ip Man is indeed Bruce Lee's first teacher in Hong Kong for many years, and that Ip man was indeed asked to teach the Japanese; the rest of the significant historical details in this biopic is a little questionable. Yip and screenwriter Edmond Wong does get some details right, but please keep in mind that this is an action film first and foremost--it is hardly a historical drama. The action direction by Hong Kong legend Sammo Hung is indeed amazing, and it is the film's main draw. The story has the usual elements of honor, family, loyalty and pride and offers very little that is fresh--but this doesn't mean that it made the film any less exciting.<br /><br />There is very minor characterization involved. The film has three acts, and the first has Ip Man's status in the Fo Shan province. He is a business man and he doesn't teach his art, there are hints that he used to compete, but he decided to keep a low profile because of his wife, Cheng (played by Lynn Hung). His relationship with his wife and son is somewhat estranged at times because of his love for sparring--she throws a tantrum whenever he fights; Ip Man is a humble man, and shows his wife the respect due her. The second act portrays the effect of the Japanese invasion on the people of China, and on the life of Master Ip and his family--which leads to the film's min encounters. While Donnie Yen may indeed lack the necessary acting ability to portray him dramatically--he sure has the presence of a highly trained martial artist. Director Yip did the right thing in focusing more on fights than dramatic impact. There are also some touches of social commentary seeing as how some Chinese prey on their countrymen and they only look out for themselves.<br /><br />As I've said, Sammo Hung's action choreography is indeed phenomenal and it sure helps when you have a cast of real-life martial arts practitioners and action-honed actors such as Yen, Louis Fan and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, who holds a Kuro Obi in Judo in real life. Sammo Hung maintains a nice balance between finesse, realism and downright brutality--the fights are very intense and very focused. It is a mix of the usual wire-fu and occasional acrobatics. Highlights include, Ip Man taking on 10 Japanese fighters in one time, the fight between Fan Siu Wong and Yen is quick but exciting, complemented with some subtle doses of humorous cracks. The fights are exquisitely shot, with multiple camera angles in a perspective view to close ups, so you can see all the hard-hitting action. There are also times when an opponent is thrown in the camera's view and I thought this added a lot of style and intense attitude. Wilson Yip and company knows how to shoot fight sequences and their skill proves the film's showstopper.<br /><br />The action encounters are nicely placed and Wilson Yip needs to be credited for maintaining an excellent pace with its balance between action and drama. While this film is historically inaccurate, for the most part, it does succeed as an action film--a very well done at that. The film does ultimately fail as a character-driven, true-to-life biopic. Donnie Yen's \\"Ip Man\\" is more about his capabilities as a fighter than who he really was as a man, which is no doubt due to fact that it wanted to maintain a China-friendly film. The film's structure more of a popcorn action film than an emotional biopic of a man who made his mark in using his fists to unite the Chinese people. It plays too fast and free to fully realize the film's potential as a \\"based on true events\\" type of deal.<br /><br />Despite some flaws in the script, and the filmmakers relying too much on the audiences' good beliefs rather than developing Ip Man as a man than as a caricature of a folk hero; (no doubt an attempt to match Wong Fei Hung in \\"Once upon a Time in China\\" and Huo Yuan Jia in \\"Fearless\\") to portray him as an inspirational role model/saint. \\"IP MAN\\" is a truly exciting film which is just full of action and the energy it exudes is just so much fun to watch. I am rather very interested in seeing as to what Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen would bring \\"IP MAN 2\\", which would hopefully show more of his experiences in Hong Kong (which may include his time with Bruce Lee). Of course, by that time, I've read that Wong Kar-Wai's version of \\"IP MAN\\" will be released and will hopefully have more historical significance as well as action thrills.<br /><br />Still, this film comes with a \\"Highly Recommended\\" rating from me, it does rule as martial arts action film.

B0000C3I6U|5.0|For anyone who is or was involved in the sport of body building, this is a classic \\"documentary\\" that will help bridge the generation gap between the often misunderstood old timers and current aficionados. The film includes early footage of legends working out and hanging out together, right around the 1975 Mr. Universe/Mr. Olympia event in South Africa. It has surprising and interesting \\"character studies\\" of the greats (Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lou Ferrigno, Franco Columbo, Mike Katz, etc). For example, I was initially, like many others, very surprised to hear of Arnold's reluctance to attend his own father's funeral shortly before a contest for fear of psyching himself out and putting himself at a competitive disadvantage. The new DVD has bonus footage that serves to follow-up with open questions from the first edition. The viewers now have the opportunity to listen to Arnold's alternate explanations for the infamous \\"funeral\\", \\"pump\\", \\"Mike's blue t-shirt\\" and other interesting segments from the original cult classic. I loved this movie the first time I saw it many years ago; I enjoy it more now with the additional materials. I recommend this DVD to everyone.
1423113497|4.0|I worried when I started this that I may not be able to follow it.  I vaguely know the stories of the Olympians so I wasn't sure if that would make a difference.  Thankfully it didn't.  I really enjoyed this book.  It is a unique story and the author had the main character not remembering the stories too so we get little recaps when needed.<br />This is a fun read.  There is action and adventure and jokes.  There are also family relationships and friendships to pull for.<br />Percy learns that he is a half-blood.  While at half-blood camp he learns about his powers, who his dad was that he knows nothing about to begin with and he gets to go on a quest.<br />It was a great journey.  I could feel a connection with Percy and his friends, Grover and Annabeth, through the story.  I could feel there frustration, hope and happiness.  I kept hoping they would make it and of course in the end be able to save the day.<br />The author did a really great job creating this world and putting the Olympians in the modern world.

B0009HLDFU|5.0|This is a great double CD, but I'm just going to come right out and say what no one is talking about: there are some very unusual themes in there, I mean for alternative rock at least.    If you listen to the lyrics, the whole thing sounds like it's being addressed to a deity, and Dave appears to be working very hard at figuring whether he (or maybe it's really the listener) is serving the good one or the bad one. Don't get me wrong, I'm no religious fanatic, but these lyrics reference a lot of Christian themes, and it's consistent. Is Dave Grohl going Christian Rock, or what?    I mean look at what's mentioned in the songs: afterlife, damnation (\\"say your prayers\\"), choosing life or death, mortality, damnation again, making one's peace, being saved from ghosts and visions, being shown the way, \\"every time I wonder I go under\\" (unquestioning faith), being reborn, being \\"forever yours (beneath the dirt)\\", losing all to find \\"you\\", a \\"miracle\\" ... on and on. I'm not making this stuff up - it's in almost every song. I just thought somebody ought to talk about it. The songs remind me of Rumi poems, where you can't quite tell whether he's talking to his lover or to \\"the Beloved\\". -Verrrry interesting.    Uh, oh yeah, and it is truly a great album, what an ambitious project, keep up the good work. I'm serious.
B00003CWNR|2.0|I saw this movie. The story is the fiction of someone's fertile imagination not based on fact in any way. Children in orphanages during WW1 and WW2 were there because their parents could not take care of them for different reasons. I doubt that abortions were ever performed in orphanages. I lived in one and while there was a hospital on the grounds, abortions were never performed. I don't feel abortions are ever justified and I found no enjoyment in seeing it portrayed in a movie.
B0031OCY2E|1.0|I will keep this brief because I have already wasted enough time simply watching this dismal, disappointing mess. Unless you have some masochistic desire to watch uninteresting men with lousy hairpieces wander around, speaking endlessly about nothing, then save your time and money and avoid this train wreck. It is utterly devoid of any entertainment value. Some reviewers have referred to its \\"humor\\"....there is none. Let me restate that....there is NONE.    I cannot describe the plot, simply because no coherent plot is ever presented. The story consists of an endless, confusing narrative which accompanies countless, confusing scenes in which boring individuals interact in dull and uninteresting ways. Just describing it is making me tired and angry that I wasted the time to do so.    As an act of humanity to save others from the suffering I endured, please heed my advice and rent or buy any of the countless better movies currently available. I know a good movie when I see it....and, trust me, this one is absolutely awful.

He picks these \\"aren't the U.S. and capitalism horrible\\" movies over and over again. Ironically, his love for creating a hate for this country is only outdone by his love of the profits it brings to him personally. I'm sure he jups at the chance to be in any movie that casts OTHER countries or thier leaders in a good light (Invictus).

0425129608|5.0|\\"Evil Under the Sun\\" is one of Agatha Christie's best mysteries, right up there with [[ASIN:1579126278 The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]], [[ASIN:1579126235 Murder on the Orient Express]] and [[ASIN:0007136838 And Then There Were None ]]. To my knowledge, it's been filmed twice, a rather melodramatic [[ASIN:B001KZOVJK feature film]] starring Peter Ustinov as the famous Belgian detective, and then more sedately with David Suchet as part of the ongoing [[ASIN:B000068QOB television series]]. It's also been adapted as a [[ASIN:B000UQURQ6 video game]]!<br /><br />At first glance, it's a typical mystery set-up: a group of colorful characters are gathered together in an isolated area, a murder is committed, everyone has motivation, but not all have opportunity. Throw in your usual red herrings, obscure clues, false leads, and a detective that can successfully puzzle it all out, and you have a perfect whodunit.<br /><br />Hercule Poirot is enjoying a sunny holiday at the Jolly Roger Hotel, built on the idyllic Smuggler's Island. Around him the talkative guests sunbathe, gossip, knit, swim and watch each other. An observer of human nature, Poirot is in his element, and it's with interest (but little surprise) that everyone's attention is on Arlena Marshall, a retired but beautiful film actress, who revels in the attention. Tall, slender and bronzed, with curly red hair and oozing sex appeal, all the men are left dumbstruck in Arlena's presence, whilst the women gnash their teeth in disapproval. Not even Poirot is left unaffected by her beauty, but he's amply aware of the chaos that the woman is causing.<br /><br />The man-eating Arlena enjoys toying with men, and currently has her hooks into Patrick Redfern, a young man who seems completely under her spell. The fact Arlena is a married woman and that Patrick's young, distressed wife is watching her husband engage in an affair right before her eyes, seems of little importance to Arlena.<br /><br />Naturally, she ends up dead, and having already engaged in conversation with a rather fanatical reverent in which both men acknowledge that there is evil everywhere under the sun, Poirot is not hugely surprised to hear that Arlena has been strangled on an isolated beach on the island known as Pixy Cove. The only access to the island is via a causeway, though the police can't rule out someone coming by boat to the isolated Pixy Cove, Poirot instinctively suspects that one of the guests is the culprit. As the last one to see Arlena alive, pushing a dingy out to sea and clearly on her way to meet somebody, Poirot begins his investigation.<br /><br />Who's the murderer? Everyone seemed to have a motive to kill her, from a resentful stepdaughter, a cuckolded husband, a jilted lover, a jealous wife, a romantic rival with designs on Arlena's husband...or was it something less personal? Was she the target of a religious fanatic? Did she disturb drug-dealers using Pixy Cove as a drop-off point? Was she being blackmailed? The possibilities keep piling up, as do the obscure clues scattered about: a bottle thrown out of a window, a pair of scissors on a beach, a bath drawn in the middle of the day - it all means something only to Poirot.<br /><br />The atmosphere of \\"Evil Under the Sun\\" is brilliant; after first introducing the island as the home of a reclusive captain who never had a family, the story starts some years later after his house has been renovated into a resort (and most copies of the book even come with a map of the island). Despite the warm sunshine and sandy beaches, Christie infuses the book with a clammy sense of foreboding, danger, and even - evil. The characterization is vivid and as always, the twists and turns keep you guessing right till the end.<br /><br />If you've never read Christie before, then this is a perfect place to start.rsation with a rather fanatical reverent in which both men acknowledge that there is evil everywhere under the sun, Poirot is not hugely surprised to hear that Arlena has been strangled on an isolated beach on the island known as Pixy Cove.

Despite the warm sunshine and sandy beaches, Christie infuses the book with a clammy sense of foreboding, danger, and even - evil. The characterization is vivid and as always, the twists and turns keep you guessing right till the end.     If you've never read Christie before, then this is a perfect place to start.

B0027ZEHGO|5.0|This movie was jaw dropping.  I was in my early 20's at a client's house working as a rual visiting CNA when my appendix burst.  I spent a week at a hospital in the nearest city and was left with a $22,000 hospital bill.  Had my life not been in danger I would have left and gone home, because I couldn't pay for it.  At the time I was making $7.00 an hour & had no insurance.  My credit suffered for years.  I had to sell my home to pay for it.  It was quite the slap in the face to see this movie years later and learn that most countries in the world would never put their citizens through something like that.  Yet our country, the \\"greatest country in the world\\" does.  Had I lived anywhere else, they would have patched me up and sent me home and I could have simply kept my home & gone on with my life as usual with free pain killers to boot!<br /><br />Michael Moore is my hero.  I loved this movie.  It was informative, funny & entertaining and can change the world.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have read all the books Charlaine Harris has written for this series and I am happy with the way HBO has handled the mini series. Of course the show will be different than the books, no one can portray everything the same as you read it, and I was excited to see the way the series took off! It is different enough that I feel like I have a whole new series to enjoy without knowing what will exactly happen. The characterization is very well done towards the way Charlaine Harris has written them in her books plus more that only HBO can add. It was such a blessing to see them pick up her series as some of the more erotic content can be show-cased. This is just one of the ways this show has became so popular and will stay popular for time to come. The DVD of the first season I was happy to see the way the disks were arranged except I would have liked separate cases instead of a fold-out but the information on the fold-out is nice as are the pictures of the main characters. This is one of my prized DVD collections now.

0641577354|5.0|Gerstner's book about saving one of America's most important companies (IBM) from bankruptcy is interesting and a real page turner.  IBM knew what was wrong after the PC became popular and mainframe computers lost much of their appeal, and had file drawers full of strategy documents on how to fix the situation, many of which would have worked, but IBM's top executives just could not change the company.  Gerstner's insight was that IBM was its own worst enemy.  Discovering what the single critical factor was in changing IBM and how Gerstner fixed it is worth many times the price of this book.  However, two of Gerstner's conclusions are also worth reading: (1) He succeeded because of education, hard work, and self-help; and IBM succeeded not because of veniality, but because it found out what its customers and potential customers wanted and needed and supplied those needs and wants at a price the customers could afford.  Life is fair and the world makes sense after all.
B000UG78NG|4.0|I just finished reading this book about thirty minutes ago.  It had been suggested to me by several friends who said it was incredible.  Expectations were high.    The book over all is good.  I love the characters.  Ambrose is a little cliché for my taste.  I, unlike some of these reviews, liked Denna.  All (or at least most) of us guys have known a woman at some point in our lives that completely captivated us for no explicable reason, even while we knew it was not in our best interest to be anywhere near them.  Kvothe is a good reluctant and flawed hero.  Sim and Wil are great.  I loved Bast.  The Chandrian... after a while you just stop caring about them, and I imagine that's going to be a problem in the next book.    The story telling is great, but the pacing is very odd.  I didn't mind much until I realized I was careening toward the back cover and there wasn't nearly enough book left to resolve all that I hoped to have resolved in this book.  Don't get me wrong, I expect some sort of hook for the next book.  But honestly, not a damn thing of any magnitude was sorted out.  The end of the book was utterly unsatisfying to me.    But I enjoyed getting there, and I suppose that's what matters.  I will recommend this book to people after the next one comes out.  If it weaves everything together, it could be a magnificent tapestry.  If it doesn't, this story will be a tangled ball of yarn fit for a kitten's play thing.

B002ZG98Z0|3.0|I read some of the critical reviews and the one theme that seemed prevelent is that this movie is 2 and a half hours and seems like you can't wait for it to end.  I never felt that way about this film and actually enjoyed the movie up until the very end.    Even the wedding at the beginning was a lot of fun with Carrie being forced to wear a tuxedo because she is the best \\"man\\" at Stan's wedding to Mario Cantone.  Our question gets answered that we thought they hated each other but as they got older, they were left with no one else but each other.    Goofy Charlotte seems to be happy with her nanny and her children until Samantha tells her to watch out because the nanny doesn't wear a bra which makes Harry very happy.  All of a sudden Charlotte's world is thrown upside down and every second she is fixated on Harry possibly cheating with the nanny.     There are some really funny parts to the film like Samantha thinking she is not too old for a dress to Smith's premiere that Miley Cirrus also wears.  The girls get whisked of in the luxury of a private jet that each seem to get their own virtual apartment in.  They end up in the UAE at one of the most impressive hotels on the planet with their own private butlers and cars.    Carrie and Big (John) have become a \\"bored\\" married couple and try to find ways to rekindle what they had even if it means Big will stay at Carrie's old apartment by himself a couple of days a week.    Just about all the characters from the HBO show make a appearance in the movie including Carrie's old flame Aiden (but what happened to Jennifer Hudson?).  Will Carrie end up going to Aiden or will she be able to work out her issues with Big?    Then we have Miranda being treated badly by her boss who puts his hand in her face at meetings while giving away her clients to a male lawyer.  She is so involved with this abusive boss's work demands that she has all but forgotten anything her son has at school.    The movie is full of some enjoyable minorcharacters such as Carrie's private butler who works real hard so he can purchase a plane ticket to see his wife every three months.  We also see how veiled Moslem women can eat french fries.    Don't believe the critics.  If you are a fan of the series then you will definately like this film.
B00004XONN|5.0|I hated this album so much the first time I listened to it that I thought about returning it. However, my admiration for OK COMPUTER inspired me to give it another shot. Like a lot of great works of art, KID A is challenging, but those who put the effort into understanding and appreciating it are richly rewarded. On this album, Radiohead really pushes themselves and popular music to new limits.This is not a rocker and features nothing likely to appeal to the masses. While excellent  in themselves, the songs are truly parts of a larger work, and KID A should be listened to as a single piece. The formal and textural experimentation is truly original, and stops this slow and meditative music from ever fading into background music. One's attention is captured while he or she is pushed to have feelings not easily explained nor often induced by music. BTW, as most of my reviews will show, I am primarily a jazz and blues fan...not some \\"new age\\" hipster...in other words, Radiohead is such a great group that people who dig HOwlin' WOlf and Charley Patton can still get a lot out of their amazing music. Please do not miss this essential ablum from the ONLY essential artists to emerge in the last decade and a half.

B001NFNFNU|4.0|When watching `Changeling', one can't help but get the feeling that they are being told exactly how to feel.  The film is very, very thick with manipulated intentions that weigh on the audience.  The film basically drips with manufactured emotional consequence, feeding you the feelings you're going to embody and delivering one harrowing moment after another.  This is a film that desperately wants attention (of the awards body kind), a film that knows exactly what to do in order to ensure that you are going to walk away with the desired emotional impact.<br /><br />Like I said; it kind of works.<br /><br />The main issue I have with `Changeling' is that it tries so hard that it fails to incorporate something essential, something human.  Instead of delivering us layers of emotion, we are delivered almost one unmovable line of high-octane intensity.  This is a film that wants an Oscar, and it knows that Oscar very rarely looks in the direction of subtlety.  Oscar, as a rule, prefers flashy.<br /><br />That is what `Changeling' offers.<br /><br />There was a lot of flak given to Angelina Jolie upon the time of this film's release, especially when she started attaining acting nominations.  I have seen parody after parody of her \\"I WANT MY SON BACK\\" moaning and I have to admit, I find them amusing.  Sadly, it is not Jolie that should be getting the flak, but the writers.  The script itself doesn't give Jolie anything to really work with.  She has one range here, and she sticks to it rather well.  In fact, her performance isn't one to balk at, and in the film's quieter moments she really shines (those courtroom scenes where she says absolutely nothing are hauntingly effective).  Sadly, she is reduced to a screaming mother throughout half the film, and that grows tiresome, and clich&eacute;d.<br /><br />I will say this, I had no idea what this movie was about when I first saw it.  I mean, from the buzz and the speculation, I kind of thought it was something supernatural.  Thankfully, that is not the case.  The film claims to be based on a true story, but it is apparent that some facts have been changed in order to create more tension and even to tie in some loose ends.  The fact remains that this film concerns a mother's search for her missing son.  Due to police corruption, this mother is reunited with a boy who is not hers, and when she tries to convince the police of that fact she is thrown in a psychiatric ward.  It isn't until a major break in the case is discovered that her name is cleared, paving the way for her to take even more action against the police force.<br /><br />The film has a few notable flaws, outside of the one I already mentioned.  It does come off rather stuffed in the end, as it becomes apparent that they are trying to fit a lot in here.  The films focus seems to get jumbled in all the plot lines running in and out of it.  Also, the acting is uneven.  The performances range from good to bad to sometimes good, sometimes bad.  Like I mentioned, Jolie has her moments, but the script doesn't do her any favors.  Devon Conti doesn't have to do anything except be unintentionally creepy, and this is a slight deterrent from the film.  It is ridiculously apparent that the kid is NOT her son from the clich&eacute;d way he carries himself.  I'm not a fan of John Malkovich, but he doesn't make any major errors here.  Jason Butler Harner fares best here, and actually turns in a layered performance that makes you want to know more.  I almost wish the film had been about his character, although I wouldn't really want to watch much more about the awful things he did.  Eddie Alderson is pretty bad and unbelievable as Sanford, especially his breakdown scene; very `actory'.  Amy Ryan is, once again, a clich&eacute;.  As much as I HATED his character, Jeffrey Donovan was extremely good here, completely diving straight into a frustratingly ruthless character.<br /><br />All of this said; it kind of works.<br /><br />It's funny, because you would figure that, with this many issues, I'd be warning you to stay away, but the way that this film is pieced together makes for a really rewarding experience.  I actually really like this film (thus the B grade).  It is obvious on many accounts, but it is also very intense and pretty moving, even if it is manipulated to an extreme.  The sets are gorgeous (and Jolie has rarely looked this luminous).  The film is beautiful to look at, from the costumes to the cinematography.  Everything fits nicely together, and even though it tries to stuff a lot into the films conclusion, it manages to make it work because it is not afraid of running over that two-hour mark.  So, regardless of the negative points, I still highly recommend this film.<br /><br />I bet you didn't see that coming.ay, but the way that this film is pieced together makes for a really rewarding experience.

B001N44BVQ|3.0|That was one of the big disappointments I had with `Body of Lies'; it came across rather cheap.  The film seemed to borrow heavily from a lot of other films and brought nearly nothing new to the table.  I have to admit, I wasn't expecting a lot.  I read the novel a while back, when this film was still in the making, and I had some major issues with it.  I found it far too clich&eacute;d and generic and lazy, especially the second half where everything just seems to take a nose dive into ridiculousness.<br /><br />The film followed suit.<br /><br />I think I have some other issues with the film though.  Sadly, it just doesn't work very well.  The storyline, while easily followed, is hard to really digest.  It just doesn't make a lot of sense, and like I said, the second half just catapults into preposterousness.  I don't want to get into my complaints too heavily, because they would give away far too much of the film, but then again maybe I should just throw up a SPOILERS disclaimer and let it all out!  I'll say this, the fact that Hani continues to work with Farris is highly unlikely and the fact that everything, in the end, becomes all about a piece of tail that Farris can't keep his eyes off of is the same thing that made me seethe at the novel.  I mean, how clich&eacute;d it is to take a perfectly fine premise for a thriller and turn it into a soap opera gone wrong.<br /><br />And despite Crowe's excellent performance, Ed Hoffman is almost an offensive stereotype.<br /><br />The acting is pretty strong, outside of Leonardo DiCaprio, who just cannot handle accent work very well.  He comes off stiff and unrealistic here, especially when he struggles to act `angry' and use his accent.  His character development is laughable and in the end this winds up being one of his worst performances (yes, it's up there with that `Blood Diamond' fiasco).  The rest of the cast, especially Mark Strong and Russell Crowe, work wonders with what they are given.  It's funny, they actually sell two characters who are very poorly written yet essential to the films progression, so Ridley Scott should be thanking his lucky stars for that bit of screen casting.  Strong, I predict, is going to be very big this decade.  I've seen him in just a few things, but he has major presence.  Crowe, as we all know, is a brilliant actor.  I will say, it was nice to see him tackle a character that is very different from his usual work.  He was almost comic relief here, but in a very serious kind of way (Hoffman may make jokes, but don't take him lightly) and he nails it.<br /><br />\\"Don't have kids.\\"<br /><br />Oh yeah, and his accent work was miles ahead of whatever it was that DiCaprio was trying to pull off.<br /><br />In the end, `Body of Lies' only manages to bring mild thrills to the table, with a `happy' ending that just doesn't cut it.  It is a clich&eacute; ridden mess that seems clunky and unfocused in times and that suffers from a blatantly bad lead performance.  It's not a complete waste of time, but it isn't a film that deserves multiple viewings.<br /><br />You can find much better.ly written yet essential to the films progression, so Ridley Scott should be thanking his lucky stars for that bit of screen casting.

B0030U1TLQ|5.0|The remaster is an improvement in sound quality over my 1989 CD, but not such a big one that you'd notice unless you were paying attention on a reasonably high quality stereo ($1000+). As is so often true, the remaster is mastered louder, so don't be fooled by that. After compensating for the volume change, both frequency extremes are more extended in the remaster, with the bass showing more weight and the treble sounding more open. Overall, there is more transparency and an enhanced sense of the instruments inhabiting separate spaces in the soundstage. But let's not overstate things -- the 1989 original was a good sounding CD for its day, and the remaster is not a revelation. Verdict: audiophiles, the remaster is worth it; everyone else, buy this set for the live bonus CD.
B002YIHO7I|2.0|I have been a fan of Sade since she first came out, but I must say I was extremely dissapointed in this album. In my opinion, the lyrics on this album are weak and don't make any sense at all. The strongest song rythmically is \\"The Moon and the Sky\\" and the rest of the songs are boring. Maybe she'll release better material in the future!
B00127RAJY|2.0|My complaint about this video is not the exercises themselves but the way they are delivered.  Like most people, I grew fond of Jillian as the semi-insane, in-your-face instructor on The Biggest Loser.  I think her approach resonates with people because sometimes we just need someone screaming at us \\"Get up off your butt and get working!\\"  But there is none of that in this video.  It is a traditional exercise video, with decent cueing and instruction, but no \\"fire\\" whatsoever.  Given what I have seen and come to expect from Jillian on TBL, I would think a lot of people, like me, simply find the workout too boring to do on a regular basis.

0307266303|4.0|I have to agree with many reviewers here who were motivated to tie on their sneakers and hit the pavement. This book certainly will get you off the couch and out the door. It did me. However, I think the book appeals more to those of us who were runners or who run now and then for the fun of it. I don't think anyone who has never been interested in running, or jogging, will be changed by it, even if they pick BORN TO RUN up and read it out of curiosity. But that's just my opinion. I'm sure there will be someone somewhere who will take up running because of it, but I think they will be the exception.    I found the information about running shoes to be interesting and the scientific theories about why we run are fascinating. Of particular interest were the pages dealing with the reclusive Tarahumara of Mexico. I wish Mr. McDougall had written more about them than about the ultra-marathoners he knew. They, the 100+ milers, seemed to be a bunch of middle-agers who never matured beyond adolescence. Too, like another reviewer, I found the final chapters to be disappointingly anti-climactic. (Hence 4 Stars)

009951186X|4.0|Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was \\"Mansfield Park\\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.<br /><br />As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.<br /><br />Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.<br /><br />And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).<br /><br />Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.<br /><br />And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.<br /><br />\\"Mansfield Park\\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society.d herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others).

B00003CX9E|5.0|Rosebud.<br /><br />This is perhaps one of the most well known opening lines to any film, and it comes from an appropriate source.  Orson Welles's Citizen Kane.  On may be surprised to learn however, that a film long considered on of the greatest films of all time wasn't a hit when it was first released.  In fact, released in 1941, the film was not a cultural marker of its time.  In an era beset with stress and the harsh realizations of reality, the general audience demanded a lighter fare in their movie-going experience.  The musicals of MGM were big at the time, and it wasn't until Welles own The Stranger was released in 1946 that he reached a mass audience.  However well received The Stranger was, Welles despised it, calling it his worst picture ever.<br /><br />Citizen Kane only received lukewarm reception from the public.  The critics immediately hailed Welles as a genius, and the worst reviews rated Citizen Kane as a masterwork of their time.  There was no indication of the fact that almost sixty years after it was made, it would still be hailed as the best movie of all time by the American Film Institute.<br /><br />The question begging to be asked is, \\"What makes this film so good?\\"  I honestly had a lot of trouble reconciling myself to the fact of its greatness.  Like so many objects of art in our time, once something is proclaimed great by a number of people, it has a certain sort of inertia that will not allow people to consciously question its greatness.  I know few people who have worked their way through such dense behemoths of books suck as Tolstoy's Anna Karina or Joyce's Ulysses.  Even with this fact, they remain classics of their languages, and held up as gold standards, which we should only hope to reach.  But I digress.  The problem with our generation is that we don't have the attention span to realize when we are seeing a master storyteller at work.  Many of the methods Welles pioneered have now become so overused that they have fallen in the realm of the clich&eacute;.  The cinematography we see was at the forefront of Film Noire, a genre whose popularity lasted well into its second decade, and whose only defeat was the rise of color in film.  Also seen is the non-linear story line, a device we can see influencing directors as diverse as Francis Ford Coppola and Quentin Tarintino.ealm of the clich&eacute;.

B003JSSPSY|4.0|Usually when the hero of a fantasy series kills the villain and saves the world, that's where the story ends. But apparently Richard Cypher isn't getting that kind of break. \\"Legend of the Seeker: Complete Second Season\\" is a creepier, grimmer affair in places than the previous season, with a new onslaught of grotesque monsters and magical adventures.<br /><br />Richard (Craig Horner) and his friends join in the celebration of Darken Rahl's death... only for their banquet to be crashed by a monstrous \\"skreeling.\\" Apparently rifts to the underworld of the dead (ruled by the evil Keeper) are opening, and undead banelings are rising to attack the living.<br /><br />The only way to stop all this: find the legendary Stone of Tears. So Richard, Kahlan (Brigit Regan), Zedd (Bruce Spence) and the Mord Sith Cara (Tabrett Bethel) set out on a new quest. The problem is, a new prophecy has risen saying that Richard has to be replaced by a new Seeker, or he'll end up HELPING the Keeper.<br /><br />On their journey, the little group must deal with banelings, pacifists, magical disasters, a clueless young Confessor, a familiar Mord Sith enemy,vengeful monsters, a mysterious young girl who claims to be the Creator, and an old enemy returned from the dead. And when the mysterious Sisters of the Light (nuns?) briefly take Richard into the Old World, he discovers that there is a force fighting on behalf of the Keeper -- the Sisters of the Dark (evil nuns!).<br /><br />The second season of \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" is a much darker and bleaker story than the first season was. Not only is the whole world threatened with annihilation, but we're treated to rotting-faced undead, terrible deaths, and occasional trips into the writhing screaming Dantean misery of the Underworld (so... good people go to hell too?).<br /><br />Don't worry. Most of the time, writers rely on what works best: solid standalone stories threaded on a season-long arc, with plenty of sword-swinging action, lush New Zealand scenery and magical artifacts. And there are some delightfully funny episodes (\\"Princess,\\" in which Cara has to pretend to be a ladylike royal), and snappy dialogue. It all culminates in a brilliantly complex, emotionally-wrenching finale that wraps up everything quite nicely.<br /><br />And while Richard is still a gold-hearted sweetie, the newly-scruffy Horner gets to explore some of his character's darker facets -- Richard has to  struggle with his rage, sorrow and resentment, as well as some discoveries about his family. Regan and Spence both give excellent performances as well, especially when Kahlan and Zedd are hit by magical mishaps.<br /><br />As a new addition to the main cast, Bethell gets to shine as the sarcastic, chilly Cara, who starts to slowly warm up and even briefly gets a boyfriend. And Craig Parker has a smaller but still excellent role as the casually villainous Darken Rahl.<br /><br />\\"Legend of the Seeker: The Complete Second Season\\" is a darker story than the first season, but the excellent actors and writing carry it through smoothly.here are some delightfully funny episodes (\\"Princess,\\" in which Cara has to pretend to be a ladylike royal), and snappy dialogue.

B001HN694K|5.0|What a treat!  This movie is a wonderful version of the classic story.  Tim Burton is a genius.  He surrounds himself with amazing talent: his incredible actors, the brilliant Danny Elfman on music detail, the costumes of Colleen Atwood.... I could go on and on.  See it before you write it off.  See it and get caught up in all of the magic.  The scenery, the dialogue - it is truly a masterpiece.  Bravo Mr. Burton!  Bravo Disney for letting Tim Burton make this movie.      Enjoy!
0517053616|5.0|Shakespeare requires no introduction -- he is \\"the Bard,\\" the most imposing playwright and storyteller in the English language. And \\"William Shakespeare: The Complete Works\\" brings together every one of his 39 plays, ranging from harrowing tragedies to airy little puffs of comedy -- and even the lesser plays are still brilliant.<br /><br />The plays basically are divided into comedies, histories and tragedies. The tragedies are pretty much... tragic, the comedies are not always funny but end semi-happily, and the histories... well, dramatizations of history.<br /><br />And everybody has heard of the greats here -- the Scottish lord who murders his way to kingship, young lovers divided by a feud, a Moorish general who is driven mad with jealousy, an elderly king whose arrogance rips his life apart, a very cleaned-up version of Henry VIII's split from his first wife, the goofy Prince Hal and his growth into a great king. There are feuding fairies, bickering lovers, romantic tangles, Julius Caesar's demise, gender-bending, an exiled duke/magician on his island, and the infamous \\"pound of flesh\\" bargain.<br /><br />But Shakespeare also wrote a bunch of lesser-known plays that often can't be so neatly categorized -- a rotten love affair during the siege of Troy, a Roman general attacking his own city, an Athenian gentleman embittered by humanity, Richard III's Machiavellian plot to become king, two sets of twins separated at birth, a corrupt judge obsessed with a lovely nun, Falstaff's doomed efforts to make money, and so on. Some of these (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\") aren't nearly as good as his \\"main\\" body of work, but they're still excellent.<br /><br />For all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read them AFTER you've seen a good performance. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to. But if you've seen performances of any/all of Shakespeare's plays, then his vibrant stories and poetry leap off the page.<br /><br />There are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\"). In fact, his plays are diamond mines of quotations -- some are infamous (\\"To be or not to be\\") and some of which have floated into public knowledge without labels (\\"Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once\\").<br /><br />And while some of his plays are basically fluff, he manages to weave in moral questions, criticism and explorations of the human soul. And his characters range as far as his plots -- kings and princes, teenage lovers, proud but doomed men, bratty queens, the witty but combative Beatrice and Benedick, and even the puppet-master mage Prospero.<br /><br />Shakespeare's \\"Complete Works\\" is a must-have for anyone who loves the English language -- his writing was unparalleled, and even his lesser plays are a cut above the rest.age.

Not only does Mr. Navarro have great experience from working as a profiler with the FBI, he has studied and learned from the best, including Paul Ekman, which the TV series, \\"Lie to Me\\" is based on. The book is easy to read, and you will start to see the things mentioned in the book going on all around you. You will be amazed at what you now see, but never noticed before. You will catch yourself doing many of the things listed in the book. Why? Because we all do them. I read books like this over and over, because it helps to practice and really learn it. Then go out and watch people. You will be amazed at what you start to notice and learn, and it is a lot of fun.
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|This is a great musical with real characters that come to life. My daughter loved it so much we must have watched it several times in the first week!.. Amazon's price was unbeatable!
0312356854|5.0|Sarah's Key was superb.  It is so captivating, that it's practically impossible to put down.  Well written, intriguing, informative and touch's the very core of our being.  You can't help but be moved by the story.  It was definitely one of the best books I have ever read.
0061914177|5.0|I just read Crush It by Gary Vaynerchuk - and here are my 10 reasons why you should read it.  1. It's easy to read. I am not a reader and I finished it in 4 days.  2. Gary is funny.  3. It will get you fired up to pursue your dreams.  4. If you currently own your own business it will get you re-fired up to keep going.  5. It actually has practical steps on how to get stuff done through social marketing.  6. Gary has been using the techniques he talks about in his book and they are obviously working for him.  7. Gary will speak to your entrepreneurial spirit.  8. The book uses the word \\"hustle\\" a lot and that is one of my favorite words.  9. If you are already doing well in business it will inspire you to help others do the same. It's inspired me to help my father-in-law with his businesses.  10. This quote says it all \\"If there's any message I want you to take away , it's that true success-financial, personal and professional-lies above all in loving your family, working hard, and living your passion. In telling your story. In authenticity, hustle and patience. In caring fiercely about the big and small stuff. In valuing legacy over currency.\\"  Overall, I loved the book and bought two copies after I read it, one for my dad and one for my father-in-law. Brooke is also reading it and she loves it. I think the reason I loved the book is because it not only speaks to the entrepreneur inside of me but also speaks to me as a Christian. If I work as hard on expressing my faith through love and sacrifice, like Jesus did, as hard as I work on creating a great brand, how many people would come to know his love, grace and forgiveness? Why aren't more Christians using all the tools out there to reach the lost? I don't know if Gary is a Christian, I sure hope he is. Because it's guys like him that I want talking about Jesus.    review via [...]
B002IYEQR4|5.0|Great quality image and sound. Great movie in an ultimate cut is awesome. It´s like the comic book except in a modernized. Incorporation of The Black Freighter into director´s cut is done incredibly well and it also extends the story in a very interesting way. Bonus disc such as Watchmen motion comic is a great additional to very complex movie. It´s great to have an option to compare differences in a movie and in a comic book.  Overall, the movie itself is a visual feast and I am glad that there are directors such as Zack Snyder and talents that brought up this feature containing so many details and refferences of a fictional but very true to its time story.  Thumbs up!!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I was a getting a bit depressed from reading too many non-fiction books in a row, so I needed a break with some fun fiction.  I read about this author and the third book of the trilogy in an NPR article, so I downloaded a sample of this first book of the trilogy to my Kindle.<br /><br />I was instantly hooked, and I am now halfway through the third book in this trilogy.  It is nonstop suspense and extremely well written.<br /><br />I highly recommend this trilogy.
0446563048|5.0|I had the opportunity to read an advance copy of Delivering Happiness, and let me tell you - I LOVED it!  Tony Hsieh writes in an amazingly relatable manner about his graduation from Harvard and then his development of multiple companies, which eventually led him to oversee the formation of Zappos, the online shoe store we all know and love.  At the beginning of the book there's a note that the book may not be written in a perfectly scholarly manner, which I loved.  This book is not in any way preachy.  The book is also hilarious.  I was reading it on a plane and on multiple occasions I laughed out loud, causing people to give me strange looks. Delivering Happiness is a concise history of how Tony Hsieh helped Zappos to become the shoe powerhouse it is today.<br /><br />I am very interested in how small businesses work, and this book serves as a behind-the-scenes reader for how to make a company work.  I'll admit that before reading Delivering Happiness that I knew very little about Zappos.  I especially didn't know that the most important part of the Zappos culture is customer service.  They feel they're doing their job not when they make record profits, but instead when they make customers happy.  If you order from Zappos then you know that they frequently upgrade their shipping to overnight shipping, which is just one way they strive to have a superior customer experience and make their customers happy, hence the title, \\"Delivering Happiness.\\"<br /><br />Life at the Zappos headquarters in Las Vegas sounds absolutely kick-a$$.  The company works just as hard at finding quality employees and keeping them happy as they do at keeping their customers happy.  In fact, when the company made the fairly big move from San Francisco to Las Vegas back when the company was much smaller, most of their employees decided to make the move with the company.<br /><br />After reading the book it seems as though most of what happens at Zappos is an open book.  I'm headed to Vegas in a month and I've already booked a tour of Zappos Headquarters.  {Yes!  They give free tours!}  I didn't know anything about the tour before reading the book, but now I want to know all I can about Zappos.  {I feel a little bit like a fan boy.}  I can't wait to learn a little bit more about Zappos - and yes, my new interest in Zappos is one hundred percent related to Delivering Happiness.  {While I was given a free book, I assure you that all opinions here are 100% my own.  This is a great read!}a month and I've already booked a tour of Zappos Headquarters.  {Yes!

1416550550|5.0|This book is by far the best book I've ever read.  In fact, I've read it twice--and will probably read it again.  The attention to detail is great.  Kate Morton is a master storyteller.  I pre-ordered her next book the minute I saw it was coming out and I'm counting the days until it gets here.  I've also read The House at Riverton twice.  If you haven't read it, get it now!  You won't regret it.
B000002KXV|4.0|Donald Fagan making good music is not subject to dispute. In terms of influence use and production, his work with Steely Dan and solo is of the highest caliber. I have asked people who don't like Don or Dan why, and they have said the music is too clean, too perfect. Ok--should the writing be dumbed down, modernized? Should the audio be diminished.<br /><br />No, let's not discuss if the sun is hot or if ice is cold. If this is good music. More fun would be to talk about a discovery of something  Donald Fagen did that is perfect, but impossible to plan.<br /><br />I recently spun all three solo Fagen albums back to back and found an amazing thread. This album, Nightfly, deals with the past that spore Fagen: the early 1960s, Kennedy's New Frontier. A world of torch song and Ellington.<br /><br />Fagen sits with turntable and cigarette, a Nightfly, like any 1961 DJ would have, talking about his java and Chesterfield Kings.  Covering Dion and the Belmont's \\"Ruby,\\" giving old style jazz changes to \\"Walk Between The Raindrops.\\" All the feel of JFK, rockets,  transistors replacing vacuum tubes to make  portable outside top 40 1960s radio possible is contained on Nightfly.<br /><br />Kinderkamad came in 1993: when digital technology was beginning to infiltrate daily life. Fagen is on a monitor in a car and the album talks about \\"Tomorrow's Girls.\\" It also is digitized jazz curveball rock.<br />'<br />Morph The Cat is 2006--in the post 9/11 world: the album is not explicitly conceptual, but tracks like \\"The Night Belongs To Mona\\" and \\"Mary Shut The Garden Door.\\" carry a nuance of free floating anxiety, so far from the limitless George Jetson outlook of Nightfly or the digital auto sleek of Kinderkamad.<br /><br />Steely Dan and Donald Fagen may have gone against the 1970s puff of art rock concept albums, but between ELP and Jethro Tull and Don and Dan, look who can stand, career and credibility dancing like a Nightfly.

B001PPGAIA|4.0|My young teens love this movie.  It's definitely worth owning, given the number of times we/they have watched it already.

B001BIYHD6|4.0|This is like a WHAT IF BOOK. What if, after a painful life event we COULD step out of our daily responsibilites to our work and family and just focus on what we need to focus on to heal, regain our sense of self, examine what we need to learn from, remember how to have pleasure, nurture our spirituality and find our own inner strength and balance our lives.   We cant. IN real life we all have to try to do that AND stay responsible. But wouldnt it be great if we could?    Seems many I have spoken to have either had a very positive or a very negative reaction to the premise of this book- as I did at first. Kinda outraged- that someone has the time and money to actually step outside her life routine to take the time to explore, reflect and experience, heal, and write about it. This kind of shock and a little jealous reaction can be logically attributed to financial reasons or generational enculturation about what women should do. We who are without that luxury,or an advance for writing a book. or without ever thinking a woman could/ should go on a quest like this might be resentful and dislike the book and believe she was spoiled or selfish.     It seems to appeal  more to those of us who have gone through or are going through or considering a painful divorce or split from work or people who do no longer align with our true self and needs. THose of us who feel or have felt the resulting depression and loss of direction and self.  We are a big club and it helps to know the universality of what we go through- that we are not alone on this path. If we cannot heal the way she did we could learn about it and like her find a way to be compaasionate with ourselves and even smile at ourselves in the process of recovery      Think about it, if we all, those who like this book and those who do not , were all given a magic wand to choose what we/they would do to heal a broken heart, recenter, and find themselves- They/we might even choose to experience something quite like this and find it life altering too. Since the majority of us cannot- we can learn from the lessons found in her writing about what she did.   Those who have NOT had this pain can gain more compassion for those who have. PLEASE.    Beyond the information about WHAT she DID- are her honest reactions and reflections to her own shortcomings, the DEEP pain of divorce and challlenge of finding herself.   Her writing pokes caring fun at herself and is relatable because it contains insights and truths that so many of us can relate to who have gone through divorce and depression too.     Our life circumstances - ie working and kids may not allow us to have all that time to reflect and explore but we certainly have the need to do so. Going through it with her allows us to know we are not alone. Her reflections are universal, lots like mine and those of friends on this same search and healing path.     She was like a pioneer who could take the time to deeply explore- going away to other countries and experiences to find understanding inside herself, she can hold up a mirror - often enlightening and helpful to all of us on our own heroic journeys.
0143038419|1.0|After reading just a few pages I threw the book in the garbage then I asked myself ... why the success? Maybe the same people who like this book are the same people who like Glen Beck. Maybe they are the same people who drive enormous SUVS. Maybe they are the same people who live in houses many times larger than what they actually need. Maybe they are the same people who believe in \\"clean coal\\". Maybe they are the same people who believe that America is the best damn country in the world even though they have never left the country. Maybe they are the same people who weigh 300 or so pounds and think they look good. Maybe they are the same people who believe that tatoos are cool. Maybe they are the same people who go on a tour to some foreign country and kiss the ground when they come back to America and say ... god it is good to be home. Maybe they are the same morons who voted Bush into office twice. Maybe they are the same people who oppose carbon taxes and getting away from dependence on oil. Yes, maybe they are morons. With all the moronic behavior and opinions out there these days I guess there should be absolutely no surprise that a vile vain vacuous ... dont want to call it a book .. thing like this should be given 5 stars by someone.
0307592839|5.0|I loved this book from A to B. The author does an amazing job of telling several stories that revolve in spokes around a central hub, a woman called Sasha. Sasha is the very damaged assistant to a record producer who has lived several lives by the time she is 35. In doing so, she has touched the lives of many others, and these stories are told in the book.    I was worried at first by some of the book descriptions, which seemed to indicate that the book might be more of a collection of short stories than a novel (not that there is anything wrong with that, I just don't particularly care for that type of book). But this is not the case. The characters are introduced and then you keep learning about them in very clever ways throughout the rest of the book, which spans from the 1970's through roughly 2020 as it follows the characters through life.     Egan's stories are nothing short of captivating and each character is equally interesting in their own way. The author's writing is crisp, fun, introspective, and very current. This is the best book I've read in quite some time. A strong recommend for anyone and everyone on this one.
1439102813|2.0|I wanted to like it, but didn't. It was \\"fluffier\\" than most of what I read, despite a weighty topic, and I never got pulled in by the style nor did I become attached at all to the characters.
B002ZG99CC|3.0|When I read that there was going to be a remake of the 1984 film The Karate Kid, I smiled in fond recollection of the original (which was a great family favorite in our house) and was interested in seeing the new version because it was being shot in China - a country (and a culture) about which I feel I have a LOT to learn.  I was looking forward to seeing it.<br /><br />The results? A mixed bag. Since I generally prefer to judge a remake on its own merits and try to avoid making too many comparisons to the original, I was somewhat surprised that, after seeing Karate Kid 2010, ALL I was doing was making comparisons in my head - comparisons in which the new version kept coming up short. Annoyed with myself, I decided to watch the 1984 version again to make certain it wasn't just nostalgia that was coloring my opinion. So I re-watched. It wasn't just nostalgia - the original IS better.<br /><br />The Karate Kid 1984 wasn't the best written or best acted film ever - or even of 1984. But it was very popular. Kids liked it. Their parents liked it. People saw it multiple times. They quoted from it (\\"wax on, wax off\\"). Some, including my own kids, still do. :-) Enrollment at karate schools across the country rose dramatically. What really came home to me during my back-to-back viewing of the two films is that the new version simply lacks much of the heart and most of the humor that formed the basis for that initial popularity. And both of those - the heart and the humor - came, IMO, from the wonderful relationship between Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita). While the plot of the remake closely follows the original, the new film never comes close to capturing the essence of that relationship and so failed to engage me in the same manner the original did.<br /><br />But while I didn't find the heart and humor in The Karate Kid 2010 that would have given me that \\"absolutely love it\\" feeling, the film has its own charms and I was able to enjoy it on its own merits, particularly in a couple of areas where it clearly outclasses the original, such as:<br /><br />  * The athleticism of its stars (Jaden Smith as Dre Parker, Jackie Chan as Mr. Han & Zhenwie Wang as the bully, Cheng). Jaden Smith, even at age 11, has more muscle definition than Ralph Macchio had at twice his age (or possibly ever) and is physically much more convincing as a student who could master difficult martial arts moves in a short space of time. Chan and Wang (Wang particularly) are also more convincing athletically than their counterparts.<br />  * The vastly superior fight scenes. Each and every fight scene is better \\"choreographed\\" and much more interesting to watch. (They are also more violent - parents might want to see the film before taking children under the age of 10 or so.)<br />  * Dre's friendship with the violin prodigy Meiying (Wenwen Han). Even as a dedicated fan of Elisabeth Shue (the love interest in the original film), I found the Dre/Meiying relationship more appealing. I probably would have enjoyed their storyline more if the writers had simply left it platonic and concentrated on the cultural differences between them to create some tension, but their relationship made possible one of my favorite moments in the film: the scene where Dre goes to Meiying's home and addresses a formal apology to her father in Chinese. I also loved the violin piece she played.<br />  * The gorgeous scenery. Views of China including the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and a mountaintop temple were simply stunning. (Those interested in seeing more of China might want to check out [[ASIN:0300141653 Wild China: Natural Wonders of the World's Most Enigmatic Land]]).<br />  * And, lastly, the ancient healing method? MUCH cooler in the new film.<br /><br />Both films have a collection of underlying messages that they effectively deliver - that violence is not the answer, that there is honor is being a peacemaker, that bullies often learn their ways from others and, most meaningful to me personally, that children (or anyone for that matter) should never have to live in fear. I will say this: if a remake, even if it doesn't quite live up to the original, renews these messages and makes them more accessible to another generation, I'm in.<br /><br />I give this new version of The Karate Kid 3.5 stars - for me it hovers somewhere between \\"it's ok\\" and \\"I liked it\\". I'm rounding down because, with some serious editing (dang, it was too long - just like this review!), and with a little more care to inject more heart into it, I would have been happy to give it a firm 4 stars. While I believe the original is better, I think this one is worth a look and that its messages are ones that every generation deserves to hear.<br /><br />Recommended.personally, that children (or anyone for that matter) should never have to live in fear.

0061537969|4.0|I'd give it 3.5 if I could. I wanted to like it more than I did. It was a VERY quick read, in part b/c of Enzo's very simple sentence structure (which I guess makes sense...). I didn't like the turn the book took about halfway (or maybe a little further). But Enzo is an endearing narator and I thought Denny and Eve were also interesting characters.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I certainly will read \\"World Without End\\" since I am a fan of Ken Follett and the \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" is on my all time top ten list.  What I refuse to do is give the publisher the benefit of my money when they choose to price their Kindle version at $17.99.  Amazon sells the paperback for $14.96, and the used hardbound is available at $14.96.  I prefer the convenience of my Kindle and I rather not cut trees down for my reading pleasure.  My response to the publisher's extortion was a trip to the library and now I am enjoying the book with the satisfaction that my money did not get to them.  Hopefully more Kindle users will refuse to bend to the exorbitant demands from some publishers.
1416550550|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is a compelling story of families and family secrets. It reminded me of The Thirteenth Tale. I did get a bit jumbled at times due to the shifting narrators and time frames but I think that added to the story and supported it. Definitely reccomend
0061537969|3.0|I was, frankly, rather disappointed by this book.  The reviews were all so positive, and being a car guy, I was naturally intrigued.  However, the story ends up being fairly maudlin and the writing is only fair.  Not a terrible book by any means, but not the classic that reviews implied it to be.

Sure, the CGI is over the top and the film will probably scare the daylights out of the young fry.  But that said, you get the feeling he's missed the mark.  Watch the 50s Disney version instead!

0316017922|4.0|My father-in-law gave this book to us for Christmas.  He wanted us to read it and when he returned to the north this summer we were to get together and have a discussion.  \\"Outliers\\" is an interesting read about success and what makes some people more successful than others.  Why isn't the person with the highest IQ always the most successful?  Gladwell shows it takes more than \\"smarts\\" to be successful, especially wildly successful like a Bill Gates.      I thought the statistics on successful hockey players and their date of birth was remarkable.  In our family discussion we discovered similar information on horses and horse racing statistics.

[...] is the online retailer that grosses over $1 billion in merchandise sales every year. Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos, has written a winner.    And what else would you expect from a person who is a winner himself.  Throughout his life, Tony has \\"won.\\" Is he lucky? Maybe, but mostly he is very intelligent and very hard working.   The book tells Tony's story from his youth, through college and into his joining (and ruling?) the business world.     I knew I would like it when, in the preface, Tony says, \\"...you'll probably notice some sentences that aren't the best examples of English grammar...I wanted the writing to reflect how I would normally talk...\\" Its a great read. Easy to follow and funny, the book is a bunch of stories all joined together to form Tony's life, and how he runs a business.     Zappos is incredible, and after reading the book, you'll know why!

B0000012XC|4.0|Original review, June 2010:<br /><br />Wilhelm Kempff recorded the 32 sonatas of Beethoven three times over the course of his long career. This set, recorded between 1951 and 1956, represents Kempff's second cycle and many consider it his finest. While there are subtle differences between this cycle and Kempff's stereo set, recorded 1964-65, his overall conceptions did not change much in between.  Even the stereo sound, which isn't particularly flattering when it comes to capturing the pianist's bell-like sound, isn't really an advantage. Given Kempff's staccato-like attack, I found myself preferring these mono recordings from the fifties over the stereo set from the sixties.  Yet that is not in any way an endorsement - in fact, I found a number of Kempff's readings to be disappointing and I'm puzzled as to why his Beethoven is held in such high esteem.<br /><br />Kempff's Beethoven readings are straightforward, efficient, and matter-of-fact, and typically on the brisk side. His playing style is compact and monochromatic, and his dynamic range is somewhat constricted - his colorless pinging tone doesn't necessarily help things either. I suppose some people would describe his Beethoven as emotionally healthy, lacking in angst, but I find much of it dry and missing the deeply-felt emotion or meaning that others extract from these scores. There's a sameness and predictability - an \\"orderedness\\" - to his playing and this lack of variety is, in the end, unsatisfying. Finally, despite the long-standing perception of Kempff's Beethoven being \\"spiritual,\\" he seems either uninterested in the mysterious inner Beethoven, or chose not to focus his attention there.<br /><br />When listening to the gem-like op. 79 sonata, which receives an outstanding reading, full of energy and creative imagination, or the fine op. 90, I'm led to wonder whether the sonatas that receive indifferent readings simply didn't hold much interest for Kempff. And there are more than a few that fall into this category. Some of the earlier ones especially come off as perfunctory run-throughs: detached, uninvolved, lacking personality.<br /><br />The late sonatas do not make a great impact either, not because of lack of interest but because Kempff's generally sunny approach just doesn't work very well in this territory. The sonatas that plumb the depths, such as the \\"Hammerklavier,\\" sound lightweight compared to Arrau, Schnabel or Brendel.<br /><br />There is no one set of \\"perfect\\" Beethoven sonatas, but there are some truly great Beethoven pianists whose recordings I would recommend without reservation. At the top of that list is Claudio Arrau's visionary cycle from the 1960's: [[ASIN:B007CW2FCA Beethoven Complete Piano Sonatas, Collector's Edition]].<br /><br />Supplemental comments, June 2011:<br /><br />After another year of listening, I've come to a greater appreciation of Kempff's Beethoven and as a consequence changed my rating on this set from three to four stars. My chief criticism, which was summed up in a comment appended to the original review, was that \\"the problem with Kempff's Beethoven is not the lack of consistency, but quite the opposite. He approaches everything the same way; it works with some of the sonatas, but misses everywhere else.\\" While I still think this is to some extent true, I've come to the conclusion that there are more sonatas than not where the pianist's approach is successful. The superb second and fourth sonatas are good examples: Kempff plays with just the right combination of arching rhythm and poetry -- a model of early Beethoven. Several of the middle period sonatas are on the same plane; here Kempff turns in pithy, sharp edged readings (op. 27 no. 2 \\"Moonlight,\\" and op. 31 no. 1 are representative) that drill right down to Beethoven's core. His reading of op. 26 \\"Funeral March\\" has real bite in the outer movements, however, the third movement, from which this sonata gets its name, lacks empahasis. This is where Kempff's lightweight approach doesn't work particularly well. Piano critic Harris Goldsmith, in his Beethoven Bicentennial overview for High Fidelity,  called Kempff's reading of op. 27 no. 1 \\"prim and dainty\\" - the perfect description of the pianist's fussy side. Kempff's op. 31 no. 2 \\"Tempest\\" is also undernourished (Goldsmith called it \\"daintily superficial\\") - it just can't compare to Richter or Arrau - yet he turns in a surprisingly powerful reading of the \\"Pathetique\\" sonata. I also found the op. 22 sonata, another Richter specialty, to be one of the finest things in this set. Goldsmith named it \\"one of the most incredible recordings in phonographic history. His pianissimo in the first movement development has an unearthly stillness that must be heard to be be believed.\\" I also liked Kempff's traversal of the \\"Pastoral\\" sonata, even though his brittle sound isn't well-suited to the music. As mentioned in my original review I think Kempff's \\"Hammerklavier\\" misses the mark, and while as a rule I still don't find his late sonata traversals convincing, I've come around to seeing what his perspective is rather than just rejecting it out of hand.<br /><br />As stated above \\"there is no one set of 'perfect' Beethoven sonatas,\\" however, Kempff's deserves consideration as a supplemental set for those who want to add to their collection.itic Harris Goldsmith, in his Beethoven Bicentennial overview for High Fidelity,  called Kempff's reading of op. 27 no. 1 \\"prim and dainty\\" - the perfect description of the pianist's fussy side.

B0021L8V1Q|3.0|after being a fan of the first Ironman, as was really looking forward to Ironman 2. The trailer made it look like a great sequel to a great movie. In the end, not what i expected. though special effects were great (in the few parts they were used) action scenes were few and far between. watch the trailer for this movie about 5 times and thats more action than this movie had. the final battle between ironman and lightning whip (a man who laughed at the thought of ironman the entire movie) lasted no more than 2 minutes. the bar fight between Downey and Cheadle was longer than that.    i wouldnt have cared so much about the lack of action if the movie had been shorter.

B0007TKNIS|3.0|overall, an OK movie. Emmy Rossum is great in the role of Christine, and That Other Guy is pretty good as Raoul (minus the goofy hair). visually, this film is as impressive as any, and the vocals are mostly solid.            the only real problem here is Gerard Butler. cast as the Phantom, Butler has a powerful, intimidating presence and a sinister countenance. but his voice just doesn't cut it. his voice lack both the power and skill to sing the Phantom's roll. he seems incapable of performing vibrato, and his voice breaks into a a harsh scream in places where he is exerting himself while singing (like at the beginning of DOWN ONCE MORE). he also seems to lack the impressive range necessary to play the   Phantom.    so again, generally a good movie. i just hated Gerard Butler. and i'm usually a Gerard Butler fan. not here though. way to go, Joel Schumacher! couldn't you have at least given us the courtesy of finding a TALENTED Phantom?
B00328G4XY|4.0|I am in the amen corner of those who question the need for yet another remaster of the timeless Electric Ladyland. Does it really sound BETTER than the MCA remaster of several years ago? The answer is no. Then you ask, what do you get if you already own the MCA release that justifies forking out another ten dollars? The answer is not much. You get a DVD that you will watch once, maybe twice and you get a meaty booklet that differs only slightly from the one that came in the MCA package. Oh, the MCA release was packaged in a jewel box and this one comes in a six-panel digipak. BFD!  Anyway, I succumbed to the temptation to buy this and the two previous Jimi Hendrix albums in this format because of the price and in the case of the first one, the extras. But you get no extras here. So in a way, I poured a little money down the drain, but all things considered I will keep both this and the MCA package.  As for the music, anyone even looking at this CD/DVD set already knows how great most of it is so there is no need to add to what's been said so many times already. If there are any weak spots in this CD, I would have to choose the jivey Have You Ever Been (To Electric Ladyland) and Little Miss Strange. Other than that, Hendrix and Co. are playing at their peak!  So, if you do not have the MCA remaster already, then I recommend this. If you do, then you alone have to decide whether or not you really need the DVD and a few different pictures.

B003102JDM|3.0|In their movie \\"O Brother Where Art Thou?\\" the Coen brothers claimed the movie was inspired by Homer's \\"The Odyssey,\\" but rather than try to be faithful to Homer the Coen brothers just focused on making a fun and entertaining movie.  The Book of Job from the Hebrew Bible is all too apparent an inspiration for the Coen brothers' \\"A Serious Man,\\" but the various plot elements of \\"A Serious Man\\" are too scattered.  The movie concerns a college professor who \\"has done nothing wrong\\" -- he is not inspiring but he is competent, he is not loving but he is faithful, he is not great but he is honest.  He manages to get by, and he closes to his mind to the rest of the world, and that could well be the reason why his world is falling apart around him:  his wife cheats on him and considers him at fault, his Korean student tries to bribe him and then insists he is in the wrong, and his neighbor infringes on his property and when he complains menaces him.  Wherever he goes this timid and frail college professor cannot find help:  his lawyer dies of a heart attack in front of him, his rabbis mutter nonsense to him, his brother is even more helpless than him, and he's plagued by nightmares as he tries stoically to get by.  As his life spirals out of control, he keeps on chanting to himself and to others:  \\"I have done nothing wrong.\\"  When, at last, he thinks his life is put right, new bigger disasters appear on the horizon.      I really didn't understand the movie, and maybe it's because I'm not Jewish and attuned to all that Jewish wisdom and stories ingrained and inherent in the religion.  But something also tells me that the Coen brothers here are playing a game.  As they play God and put their protagonist through a series of random punishments and dare him to find meaning and reason in them, they're also daring us to find meaning and reason in the chaos and randomness of this movie.  Just as the physics college professor, who's believed all his life that there's an intricatelogic to the universe that can be explained by mathematics, discovers there's no meaning to things and that he ought to just accept, we must also learn to accept that there may be no logic to a Coen brothers' film -- you either enjoy it or you do not.  And I really did not enjoy this movie.
0307277453|3.0|Too much science to be readable; not enough science to be a text book.     Thus, what could have been a very good book gets lost in the struggle between these two entities. A litte more layman's science would have made this a really good book.    Good, informative book. A good idea, but should have been written with more of a mass market audience in mind.    The last chapter of the book, \\"The Meaning of It All,\\" is outstanding...puts it all in place and brings it together, but, sadly, it comes too late in the book to raise its overall rating.

I've read poorly written High School english papers with more content and a lot more enjoyable!
B001DHXT6G|4.0|I realize there are quite a few people out there who just can't stand the idea of the classical episodes being altered in any way. In the company's defense, they really had no choice but to change some things. Consumers have bigger tvs than ever and expect picture quality to be decent. Well, the picture quality of the ships in the original series was staticky and just plain awful. So, it wasn't the company thinking \\"hmm, let's change things just because we can.\\" It was more \\"We have to improve the picture quality or it will look like crap to modern viewers.\\"     Frankly, the remastering really improved some episodes because it gives the audience views of what's happening outside the ship, which 1960s creators were unable to do. So, you get to see battle scenes happening instead of just having to interpret it through dialogue and shaking cameras.    Other changes include making the planets look like actual planets. It's really beautiful the way they did it. And there are a couple very small alterations, like in the famous episode \\"Arena\\" when Kirk battles the man in the lizard suit--excuse me, the gorn--they made the gorn look a little more realistic by having him blink like 3 times. It's very cool.    I too was a little skeptical of the remastered version at first, but now I prefer it. The picture quality is just significantly better.    Now, in regard to packaging, these dvds are some of the most terribly packaged dvds I have encountered, and I buy from Comedy Central. It's really stupid. The packaging is inconsistent between seasons (particularly between the first, and the latter two) and in order to find the episode you want you have to go looking through very losable cards.     Also, THERE ARE NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. I know most people wouldn't really care about that, but I enjoy watching films with subtitles sometimes, and I thought for like 180 dollars I would at least get some english subtitles. It's not a deal breaker for me, but it's irritating.    Lastly, there are lots of extra features and stuff. No commentary or anything, unfortunately, but some cool interviews.    So, in conclusion, I would recommend buying it, but it does have some pretty obvious faults that could have been easily solved that I guess the company decided not to fix out of cheapness.

B000F6YPR8|4.0|I'm bad at writing reviews, but I hope this helps someone -and before you read on, I should first confess that I bought this CD somewhere else online for only around 10 dollars. Also, I already expected beforehand that most of the tracks would suck but I bought it anyways. (In my opinion, Jimi's live music is generally a bit... you know... off. lol.)    So I basically bought the CD just for Track 8 \\"Machine Gun\\" -since I swear, this is the best damn version of it ever. Just this one track makes the entire CD worth buying, as long as you're paying only 10-ish and not 40-ish for it.     So I highly recommend Hendrix fans to get this CD for Track 8. Remember to get the 2nd show, not the 1st show.     That's pretty much my review for this CD. It only has one good song (in my opinion) but the song is so good that the CD itself gets 4 stars. lol. (If you want a 5-star Hendrix CD, I recommend \\"Blues\\")

I decided that I wanted to read the book and see what Neil Gaiman had originally written.  I must say I was very pleased with the book even more than I enjoyed the movie.  It explained things better and made things a lot clearer than the movie.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Neil Gaiman since it is, in my opinion at least, one of his more interesting books.
B001DDBCUA|1.0|I don't understand viewers who liked this movie, and I'm reasonably sure they don't understand me.  The movie is about the adventures of four vacuous middle-aged career \\"girls\\" who have \\"relationships\\" that are constantly in jeopardy.  The movie is crude, too long, predictable, silly and poorly written.    Okay, let's take crude.  While recuperating from a wedding misadventure the \\"girls\\" are at a four-star Mexican resort.  One of the girls gets the rumbling turistas and does not make it to the bathroom in time.  The others find this hilarious.  I thought it was stupid, insulting to their friend and to movie goers.  There's no point in going into the nude scenes; suffice it to say that they were just dull.    Too long.  I thought this was never going to end.  It's 145 minutes long, about 50 minutes longer than the average movie.  It felt as if it were much longer.    Predictable.  I hope it isn't a spoiler to say that all the troubles work out okay in the end, pretty much on cue.  I knew they would.  So should everyone else who saw this.    And this review would be remiss if I didn't comment on why I thought the \\"girls\\" were vacuous.  They are all represented to be educated and urbane.  One is a lawyer, one a writer, etc.  Their values are high fashion and self gratification.  The clothes often look as if they were more appropriate for Halloween trick or treat night.  I haven't the stomach to be more specific.    I didn't enjoy one minute of this, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with any sensitivity.

7885221660|2.0|IP Man 2 was a disappointment. It turned into a Rocky wanna-be movie. The only redeeming part of the movie was Sammo Hung's acting skill and the fighting sequence between Sammo's character and Donnie. Not enough character development on the new characters. Quite a few supporting characters from the first movie are in this sequel. I recommend watching it once but don't expect the same caliber as the first movie. Cute scene at the very end of the movie. The beginning storyline was interesting but by the middle of the movie, the story took a dramatic turn and suddenly, it is the Chinese \\"Rocky\\" movie. Good thing Donnie's character didn't yell out \\"Adrian\\" at the end of the fight. ooops, wrong movie! ;P The first one was so good. The sequel is a big let-down. I can see why Donnie didn't want to do another sequel.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Something For Everybody is popular music's finest hour. It's the fountain of youth. An instant classic. I used to drive my parents batty back in 1980 jumping around the house singing Whip It and Uncontrollable Urge now my kids jump around the house singing \\"What we do is what we do\\"... My 9 year old said \\"this music is too good to be new\\"... the torch has been passed. Something for Everybody serves to ease the pain for all of us suffering through these musical dark ages.

B000ZNRBK4|2.0|As the review title says, this hood does little to reduce flare (which is likely due to its diminutive size).     Also, when it is not in use and mounted on the camera it blocks the focus ring. Other features I'm not thrilled with are the high price and flimsy release mechanism.    I'm sure there is a good hood out there for the VR 18-55 lens, this isn't it.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|So many things wrong with this movie...let's just start with what it is. It's basically an excuse to see Sam Worthington get dressed up in a Greek-looking costume. There's really nothing more to it than a bunch of well-overused battle scenes and movie cliches cobbled together around short spasms of rock and roll music. The mythology is ludicrously incorrect, including pairing Perseus up with Io, his own ancestor, instead of Andromeda, who might as well not even be in the movie. Heck, I was even rooting for the Kraken to eat her and him, too, dang Perseus. The mumbo-jumbo about \\"somebody's got to stand up to the Gods\\" is such nonsense as to be absurd, especially considering that Perseus would have died about ten minutes into the movie without Zeus' help. Or, as both he and Hades tell everyone, before that, considering that they provide the oxygen supply. The acting was profoundly awful, too. This is one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen.

B000H6SXMY|1.0|I purchased the \\"Friends\\" complete series. This product was listed as \\"New\\". When I received the product, I was stunned and embarassed. It was obvious that the plastic on the product was not the original. The box (case) was torn on the side, the picture on the front was worn so bad I couldn't even tell what it was, and there was a layer of dust UNDERNEATH the plastic! I immediately opened it and the cases and labels looked like they were made on a personal printer. Since this is the only set I have seen, I don't know if they all look that cheap, but I wouldn't be suprised to find out that this whole set was an illegal copy. The discs, however, minus the labels, appeared to be new. The reason I was so embarassed was because I bought this as a gift for someone. I actually had to EXPLAIN that this was \\"New\\". I tested several of the discs to see if there was even anything on them. They played but any rapid movements on the show looked strange: wavy/jumpy is really the only way I can explain it. It's possible that these sets were manufactured as cheap as possible to maximize profit and that is the reason it looks and plays poorly, but due to the condition in which I received my \\"new\\" product, I am suprised the episodes weren't in Chinese with English subtitles. I actually considered giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because if this was for myself instead of a gift, I really wouldn't be that concerned with the condition of the casing.  As I stated, the discs were in good condition and I did get it for a good price (about what you would expect to pay for a used set). But the seller flat out lied about the condition of the product and therefore deserves nothing but the lowest rating. I would never buy from this person/company again because I would never be able to trust that I'm going to receive what I purchased.
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|This book blew my expectations out of the water! I was interested the moment I saw the cover. Though, with \\"not judging a book by its cover\\" I read the back of the book and had to have it immediately. The minute it came in the mail I started reading it, and within about 2 days (which is extremely fast for me) I was finished. The book is really fast paced and hooks you from the beginning!I especially enjoyed the way the book splits between the 2 point of views, it really helps you feel like you are a part of the character's lives. I never wanted to put this book down or have it end. I made all my friends read it, all of them also finishing it in a maximum of 2 days, and even had people coming up to me in the hall asking me about this book and if they could have it.All of us agreed that it may even be better than Twilight, based on the fact that the love story is more realistic. If you are hesitant at all about this book, don't be! READ IT! You WILL NOT be dissapointed!     P.S. If it helps you to know,we are Sophomores in high school :)
B003INJETO|4.0|I open the CD with great anticipation, and put it in the CD Player, only to wonder if this is a totally different band.  I look at the CD cover and there is an artistic drawing of the band members, and I can't really recognize them.  I scan through the small print to see if maybe the lead singer/songwriter has left the band, but no, it does still seem to be the same band.  So after I get over that, I continue to listen to the music, and I'm trying to think of what it reminds me of, and the best I can come up with is Alice Cooper Welcome to my Nightmare.  So, now that I am convinced this is indeed the POS that I have grown to love, I listen through the entire album about 5-6 times over the next couple of days and now I feel I can give an opinion.  I actually really like it.  I can see them doing the first half of this album as an acoustic section in the middle of a concert.  There are all kinds of musical influances flying around.  I would say muscially it is not nearly so complex, but some very nice vocals with a ton of emotion.  POS is really going to challenge it's fan base with this album, especially those that like the heavy aspects of their music.  But once you get over the initial shock, and listen to the music, I think you are really going to like it.  However, in the long run, there is a chance this album turns out to be a one off experiment, and on the next album they get back to the heavy progressive metal POS that we love.  One last comment, I don't think the production is up to their typical standards.  The album is possibly intentioally quite dull sounding, giving it a more stark and unproduced sound.  Perhaps that is why another reviewer has compared it to the White Strips.  It is a very stripped down album that does sound like it was recorded with a 2-track in a garage.  So, listen with an open mind, and just appreciate an artist that is not going to spew out the same sound album after album.  I really love these guys, and am glad they take risks.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|Not a typical Tarantino movie.  I guess I was expecting some kind of twist about 5/8 of the way through.  The movie was rather predictable after the first 30 minutes and with anti-climatic ending.  If Tarantino wasn't involved I probably would have had different expectations and would have enjoyed the movie a lot more.  Instead I kept waiting for a twist which didn't occur.

At the time of purchase none of the on-line renters had Blu-ray for Seasons 3 and 4.  The packaging is cute:  all the seasons are held in a Cylons helmet. Plus there is an action figure.  It needs a poster of the cast.      The entire season, apparently, was shot in HD.  I really enjoyed watching the series again with no season breaks and no commercials!

B001WCN23W|5.0|Maybe Aftermath was the best Stones album. If not, this is hands down. Sway, Sister Morphine, Moonlight Mile, Dead Flowers are great sleepers. Brown Sugar, need I say more? Okay, I will. Can't you hear me Knockin' is a Stones classic by itself. Mick does his best singing here, IMHO, and Keith is possibly the most under rated guitarist ever.  If you don't have this already, you're no Stones fan. If you buy it, you will be a fan soon enough.

B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Paul Simon needed a comeback in 1986 for a number of reasons. His marraige to actress Carrie Fischer had come apart. His last album, the wonderful \\"Hearts and Bones,\\" was not met well commercially. An attempt at reconnecting with Art Garfunkel had also come undone for the usual animosities. So he travelled to South Africa to visit the musicians he had been studying for a few years.<br /><br />The result was \\"Graceland.\\" In his quest to rejuvenate his musical spirit, Simon connected with a host of well known African musicians who pushed him into writing music that lifted his creative muse to a new peak. In addition to introducing American to Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Simon brought Los Lobos, Linda Ronstadt, The Everly Brothers, Youssou N'Dour and Adrian Belew on board to his unconventional brew. Simon found the music he encountered so intriguing that he married his lyrics to most of the tracks (making songs like \\"Diamonds On The Soles of Her Shoes\\" and \\"Homeless\\" into mini-masterpieces).<br /><br />Simon's newfound joy in creation made for some of the more whimsical moments, like \\"You Can Call Me Al\\" (and the accompanying video with Chevy Chase) and \\"The Myth Of Fingerprints,\\" in his solo career. The songs blended together as a cohesive whole, without a filler track to be found, and deserving of the slew of Grammys Simon picked up in its wake.
B0020MMBCG|3.0|As someone who has long made a practice of drawing and/or gesturing while talking (talking with your hands, some people call it), I felt drawn to this book (no pun intended). I agree with most of the author's general comments, and I admire him for coming up with a symbol/drawing system that is logical and, if used properly, powerful.    I think if your job or pastime requires you to play the persuasion game, it's worthwhile to learn some kind of system that allows you to draw quickly and efficiently. Roam has such a system.    This book consists of four parts. If you read just the first part, you get that warm feeling that comes from having grasped some pretty useful concepts. The other three parts show the techniques Roam uses, and these can make you feel a little lost. Unless you intend to study and learn his specific techniques, these last three parts are better skimmed than read.    He uses a specific case history, and you watch this evolve from very simple through various stages to the final step. This case history makes up, by far, the bulk of the book.    Once you understand the basic concept, you could stop reading as you finish Part 1 (it ends on page 45). The rest of the book walks you through a long example of how to use the concept.    Personally, I find this system to be too complicated to adopt for my own use. I have better uses for the time it would require to learn and practice, as it doesn't solve a problem I have. But that is only my situation; yours may be entirely different. For the small price of this book, you may want to buy a copy and judge for yourself.    The book's cover is 49 square inches in area (7H x 7W) and 260 pages long (278 pages, if you count the appendices and index). There is a newer, expanded version out now. I don't see the purpose of it, unless you want to study and adopt Roam's system as your own.    This brings us to my statement that I agree with most of the author's general comments. Where I disagree is his opinion that you have to draw pictures to communicate effectively (that, at least, seems to be what he's saying--repeatedly). I think if you hone your verbal, written, and composition skills to such a level that you can score 90% or higher on a test of Standard Written English, you will have the ability to effectively communicate.    All investments of time and money have opportunity costs. If you can't score highly on a test of SWE (few Americans can), then you should first learn English well enough to do that. Only then should you enhance your communication skills by adding the pictorial method. Then again, it may be that using a pared-down version of Roam's method could help anyone be a better student of English.

0743496736|3.0|This is the 1st book by Jodi Picoult I have read. After all the fanfare about how good she was I am sorely disappointed. Yes she can write there is no doubt about that but it is a very cliche' type story that has trouble holding my attention and I got very bored. I did persevere until the end just to find out if there was anything special about the ending. Alas no.     The writing style for this book was really geared up for teenagers. Therefore I personally would say that it is a great book for older teenagers but for adults? ... well I think it is rather lame.

1423113381|5.0|I should start this review out by saying I've been waiting for The Red Pyramid since it was first announced. I've read and loved almost everything Rick Riordan has written; from his mystery series, to his Percy Jackson series, and I must say this book didn't disappointed.    The Red Pyramid takes place in the same universe as the Percy Jackson series and as such is arranged in a very similar fashion. That said, fans of the Percy Jackson series should know that, at least in this book, no character from Riordan's other series makes an appearance in The Red Pyramid. Instead The Red Pyramid focuses on protagonists Carter and Sadie Kane, decedents of the ancient pharaohs, as they learn to accept the roles of the gods in their lives and battle the god of chaos, Set.    Riordan is likely to impress even the most skeptical fantasy reader with this young adult blockbuster. It is filled with exciting action, relatable characters, and enough mythology and imagination to make even Percy Jackson jealous. But what makes The Red Pyramid so amazing is the way the book just catches your attention and never lets go. I personally picked up the book and couldn't put it down, finishing it in a matter of hours.    The Red Pyramid is an exciting and invigorating novel that anyone, no matter their age will love. It is written well and with an incredible amount of zest, making The Red Pyramid, in my opinion a perfect summer read.  [...]
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Devo Is back !  I have loved Devo since 1980 when I heard   \\"Girl u want\\" on the radio.  I have all of their albums on Vinyl and CD.  I've seen them 6 times in Concert.  I've met them and have their autographs.    I do not understand why most of the reviews of this album,  And their previous 3 albums talk mostly about   how they are \\"less rock n roll\\" or have \\"less guitar than...\\"  What is wrong with slick synthesizer music?  I LOVE \\"Shout\\" and \\"Total Devo\\" BECAUSE they are so   electronic.  What is wrong with that?  Devo has never been a standard Rock n Roll band.  Even their very earliest music had a heavy dose of Synthesizer.    This new album is excellent.  It picks up after their best work.  New Traditionalists, Oh No, it's Devo, and Shout, and Total Devo are previously their best albums.  (not a big fan of Smooth Noodle Maps)  I do love their first 3 albums but get board listening to   the much more traditional Rock n Roll sound.    Remember Spuds....Devo stands for D-Evoloution.  So if they are musically evolving backwards,  Then they will end their careers with the most sophisticated music,  since they started it with such unsophisticated music.    That said, The new album rocks just as hard as anything they've ever done!  There is plenty of Rock n Roll guitar along with the pulsing synthesizer bass.  And Josh Freeze Rocks on Real drums harder than David Kendrick   and possibly harder than Alan Myers!!    I love the blend of Bob 1's Guitar and Jerry's Minimoog Bass.  And the Synthesizer parts are clean and fun and sound both Retro and modern  all at the same time !!!  I just wish that there was more music being made   in the classic new wave style.  But there is this new album and it is fantastic !    B Williams
B003FK8V7G|5.0|After being blown away by The Gaslight Anthem's last album, the excellent THE '59 SOUND, I was wary of the band suffering a letdown on this follow-up.  I shouldn't have worried.  AMERICAN SLANG continues right where that awesome album let off.  This is Springsteen and Petty's Heatrland Rock updated for the 21st century.  Every song is well-written, full of energy and will have you singing along before the first chorus.  Highlights include \\"American Slang,\\"  \\"Stay Lucky\\" and \\"The Queen Of Lower Chelsea.\\"  Thanks to The Gaslight Anthem, real rock for the common person is still alive and well.
B0000CM471|3.0|Hi!<br /><br />This was my first experience purchasing on Amazon.I live in Australia.<br /><br />I was surprised to hear that the book would take 2 months to reach me, how ever I<br />received it in about 10 days.

B003A4IFGY|5.0|From the opening track, \\"Jefferson Jericho Blues,\\" you can feel that this is a band burning with a new fire.  Petty sounds rejuvenated and in touch with his muse in a way he hasn't in years.  It is obvious that his time recording and touring with Mudcrutch over the last couple of years has done Petty a world of good.  Mudcrutch's rootsiness permeates this album, melding perfectly wit the Heatrland Rock that has been the Heartbreakers' bread and butter throughout their career.  One influence that I'm picking up from this record is J. J Cale.  \\"Candy,\\" \\"Let Yourself Go\\" and \\"The Trip To Pirate's Cove\\" all bear a remarkable resemblance to Cale's unmistakable Oklahoma shuffle and his laidback style is evident throughout the recording.  Petty and the boys even flirt with reggae on \\"Don't Pull Me Over.\\"  \\"U.S. 41\\" is one of my particular faves, since that highway runs through my hometown.  Other highlights for me include \\"Jefferson Jericho Blues,\\" \\"No Reason To Cry\\" and \\"Running Man's Bible.\\"  Bottom line:  this is the most vital recording from TP & The Heartbreakers in a long time and is highly recommended.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Outstanding movie. On my list of favorites.<br />The visuals are a delight, there are clear villains and heroes (keeps the cheering simplified) and the story line is complex enough to be interesting but not so complex you get lost in subplots. Overall, a treat for the whole family.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|Actually, this band is not punk at all.  Sure, they're loud, fast and play with tons of energy, but those characteristicas aren't exclusive to punk.  This album is more an update of the Heartland Rock of the 70s and 80s and the Adult Alternative of the 90s.  In fact, the band is so in tune with those influences, that there are at least a dozen lyrical references or direct mentions of Tom Pdetty, Bruce Springsteen and Counting Crows.  If you want proof that real rock & roll for the masses is alive and well, this album is for you.

1400067936|4.0|Quick summary:  humans are terrible at probability + humans are programmed to see patterns = hilarity ensues    I enjoyed the premise of the book and the conclusions, although the language is a little past my puny vocabulary.  Consider this: what if everyone's \\"mad skills\\" were the result of chance?  Humans aren't good at gauging probabilities: consider those pumping money into slot machines which haven't paid off in the last several tries.  Humans are also very good at finding patterns, to the point of finding ones that don't exist.  Worse, we like to use the patters of the past to predict the future.  3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, therefore 9 must be prime.      I read the enhanced second edition.  I would like any additions to be in a clearly marked addendum or postscript.  Further, it sort of feels like a cop out, to create a book and then add more when the critics have responded.  For example, would \\"The Road Ahead\\" by Bill Gates benefit from a new chapter on the internet?

B001EN71DG|5.0|To present the six episodes is of course a challenge. I will not present them one after another in any order (historical or chronological). I will make a few general remarks. First, why did the last three episodes come first? It was necessary for the suspense to remain intense about the only important element which is that Dark Vader is the father of both Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa, both on the side of the rebellion against the Empire. These three episodes were more naturalistic and they did not need the special effects, not possible at the time, necessary for the conception and shooting of all the artificial and very strange creatures of the first three episodes. The happy ending would have been ruined by our knowing the genetic filiation between the two young heroes and the arch-enemy of freedom and democracy. Dark Vader had to be black and dark right to the end for the surprise effect of his fathering the two young heroes to be effective. Then the first three episodes arriving afterwards in time did not have the same function they can have today when we watch the six episodes in chronological order. They created a frame of reference. It is the demonstration that the Republic can only fall because it is totally engulfed in corruption, red tape bureaucracy, the incapability to take a fast decision and to act promptly, the constant waste of time because of political maneuvering. On the other side, that of evil, swift and surprise attacks and violence are the rule. The Republic has been infiltrated to the top and the Force itself embodied in the Jedi order has been drowned in bureaucratic impotence. Then the dark side of the Force can easily convince and capture those who are suffering from that impotence and are frustrated by the refusal to act straight away. It is also necessary to think that those first three episodes that came last needed a technology that was not available before and that is the technical justification of the inverted order, though then the director plays on it and with it. Some of the scenes of these three chronologically anterior films are absolutely breathtaking and only because they use the full array of computerized effects. The race in the first film is amazing, the underwater world is fascinating and the clones and their war against the strange giraffe human species is phenomenal and were not possible without the late 1990s and early 2000s technology. And the battles would never have been that impressive without these special effects. Then we can wonder about the meaning of the whole series back in chronological order. A Republic dies in red tape bureaucracy and corrupted calculation and is taken over from the inside by the main leader who is an infiltrated putsch maker and his military coup is based on the full destruction of the only protection the Republic had, the Jedi order though this one had been made impotent by the red-tape dictatorship of the democratic Republic. The Empire that takes over is based on effectiveness, swiftness and the absence of any waste of time due to useless discussions. To the point of any decision taken by one man. Then you can speak of efficiency. But that Empire that is going to impose an absolute one-person dictatorship is not able to control the grass roots movements and the local dynamisms of all the planets and peoples of this galaxy. That's what the rebellion against this Empire needs to be effective in its turn. Underground rebellion and resistance. Yet they cannot succeed if they do not re-conquer the Force because the Empire is founded on the dark side of that Force and is embodied in the father of the main heroes and leaders of the rebellion. The Force has to be re-learned by Luke Skywalker in order to be able to face his father and defeat the emperor who is manipulating Luke's father. This Force is the only real defense and conquering power of any resistance against any dictatorship. Without a Force of that magnitude no resistance can succeed.But then the meaning changed completely from that of the last three episodes that came first and could appear as a simple metaphor of the rebellion against a dictatorship, hence a metaphor of the defeat and disintegration of the Soviet Union for one. Later on when the first three episodes that came last were available, the meaning was no longer the same because history had changed in the mean time. The meaning then is that any democracy when it forgets it has to be fast and courageous in its decisions that should refuse red tape and bureaucracy will automatically fall in the hands of potential potentates or dictators. That is a common myth and political theme in the USA: the Roman Empire died after two centuries. Unluckily the Roman Empire was not the Republic of Rome and here Lucas is playing with our references. Are the USA a target of that decay of democracy? Yes indeed. That's the message today of this set of six beautiful films with great actors, even the perambulating carpet.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDBut then the meaning changed completely from that of the last three episodes that came first and could appear as a simple metaphor of the rebellion against a dictatorship, hence a metaphor of the defeat and disintegration of the Soviet Union for one.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Imagine a film about a greedy, ruthless corporation--one which treats its own workers like expendable pawns--which brings about an unprecedented ecological disaster.  Sound timely?  Yeah, this is NOT a biography of BP and the gulf oil spill, this is the plot of Avatar, so it's eerily striking that the film was released in the year before the gulf oil spill.<br /><br />I did NOT watch this film in the theatre so I have not seen the 3-D experience, but this WAS the film that pushed 3-D over the top commercially.  It was such a phenomenon that several TV manufacturers are releasing 3-D capable hardware (initial price range around $3000) and various media content producers are making plans for 3-D content, so in a couple years you may see a lot of DVDs (and movies, and TV) with 3-D capability.<br /><br />I don't want to dwell at length on the plot.  One viewer (who didn't much care for the film) said it was like Dances with Wolves set on another planet.  Seeing the movie, this made sense.  It's set in a future when humanity has developed space flight.  No faster than light \\"warp drive\\" or anything--it takes years to reach the nearest stars, but exploration has revealed a very earthlike planet within reach.  More important, it has a very precious resource not found on earth.  Exactly what it's supposed to be made of and what it's used for were not fleshed out in the movie.  It's dubbed \\"unobtainium\\" and it looks like a metallic ore of some sort.  The problem is that creating large strip-mines also inconveniently means ripping up the planet's ecosystem and even killing the native Na'vi, a tall, slender but strong, blue-skinned humanoid race that live in harmony with their world (the way American Indians are portrayed as living more in harmony with the earth than the white settlers, in Dances With Wolves).  As the film launches, a practical-scientific experiment is underway (here, it starts getting more far-fetched) in which bodies are grown with human donor DNA combined with native Na'vi DNA--then the human DNA donor is supposed to be able to \\"connect\\" with the brain of the resulting body, and therefore live in and travel around the world without special breathing gear--the goal being to find a way to convince the Na'vi to move off an especially large deposit of \\"unobtainium\\"--else the company will simply bulldoze right over them.  This large deposit is inconveniently right under a major home for the Na'vi people.  Our heroes, of course, end up siding with the Na'vi and against the corporation...<br /><br />Almost all the movie is computer-generated (there are probably a few sets, like insides of buildings and ships that had some real backgrounds, but all the outdoor stuff was computer-generated, as were the Na'vi) and ONCE AGAIN, like with Star Wars back in the day, like with the Lord of the Rings films, and like with Ironman on Blu-Ray--this film marks a new pinnacle in computer-generated film footage.  Even without 3-D,but with the high-def available on a good Blu-Ray system, this picture is DROP DEAD GORGEOUS--easily the most beautiful DVD film I have seen on a home system to date.  I think I can get a feel for what the 3-D version might be like, just watching the film on Blu-ray, which just seem sharper and more real and more beautiful than any other CG stuff on DVD before.<br /><br />Yes, everyone's complaining that the studio released a \\"bare bones\\" version here--no special features.  Yes, the studio is going to milk the film to the max: a re-release in theatre, followed by at least one more DVD release (actually I'm betting that over the life of this product there will be at least 2 more DVD versions).  It doesn't matter.  If you haven't seen the film in the theatre (like me), you're still gonna love it on DVD.  You'll love it even more in 3-D, I'm sure.  In the meantime, this still makes a helluva present for just about anyone who ever watches a sci-fi film.  It's quite suitable for older kids, teens and adults.DNA--then the human DNA donor is supposed to be able to \\"connect\\" with the brain of the resulting body, and therefore live in and travel around the world without special breathing gear--the goal being to find a way to convince the Na'vi to move off an especially large deposit of \\"unobtainium\\"--else the company will simply bulldoze right over them.

B001EN71DQ|5.0|To present the six episodes is of course a challenge. I will not present them one after another in any order (historical or chronological). I will make a few general remarks. First, why did the last three episodes come first? It was necessary for the suspense to remain intense about the only important element which is that Dark Vader is the father of both Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa, both on the side of the rebellion against the Empire. These three episodes were more naturalistic and they did not need the special effects, not possible at the time, necessary for the conception and shooting of all the artificial and very strange creatures of the first three episodes. The happy ending would have been ruined by our knowing the genetic filiation between the two young heroes and the arch-enemy of freedom and democracy. Dark Vader had to be black and dark right to the end for the surprise effect of his fathering the two young heroes to be effective. Then the first three episodes arriving afterwards in time did not have the same function they can have today when we watch the six episodes in chronological order. They created a frame of reference. It is the demonstration that the Republic can only fall because it is totally engulfed in corruption, red tape bureaucracy, the incapability to take a fast decision and to act promptly, the constant waste of time because of political maneuvering. On the other side, that of evil, swift and surprise attacks and violence are the rule. The Republic has been infiltrated to the top and the Force itself embodied in the Jedi order has been drowned in bureaucratic impotence. Then the dark side of the Force can easily convince and capture those who are suffering from that impotence and are frustrated by the refusal to act straight away. It is also necessary to think that those first three episodes that came last needed a technology that was not available before and that is the technical justification of the inverted order, though then the director plays on it and with it. Some of the scenes of these three chronologically anterior films are absolutely breathtaking and only because they use the full array of computerized effects. The race in the first film is amazing, the underwater world is fascinating and the clones and their war against the strange giraffe human species is phenomenal and were not possible without the late 1990s and early 2000s technology. And the battles would never have been that impressive without these special effects. Then we can wonder about the meaning of the whole series back in chronological order. A Republic dies in red tape bureaucracy and corrupted calculation and is taken over from the inside by the main leader who is an infiltrated putsch maker and his military coup is based on the full destruction of the only protection the Republic had, the Jedi order though this one had been made impotent by the red-tape dictatorship of the democratic Republic. The Empire that takes over is based on effectiveness, swiftness and the absence of any waste of time due to useless discussions. To the point of any decision taken by one man. Then you can speak of efficiency. But that Empire that is going to impose an absolute one-person dictatorship is not able to control the grass roots movements and the local dynamisms of all the planets and peoples of this galaxy. That's what the rebellion against this Empire needs to be effective in its turn. Underground rebellion and resistance. Yet they cannot succeed if they do not re-conquer the Force because the Empire is founded on the dark side of that Force and is embodied in the father of the main heroes and leaders of the rebellion. The Force has to be re-learned by Luke Skywalker in order to be able to face his father and defeat the emperor who is manipulating Luke's father. This Force is the only real defense and conquering power of any resistance against any dictatorship. Without a Force of that magnitude no resistance can succeed.But then the meaning changed completely from that of the last three episodes that came first and could appear as a simple metaphor of the rebellion against a dictatorship, hence a metaphor of the defeat and disintegration of the Soviet Union for one. Later on when the first three episodes that came last were available, the meaning was no longer the same because history had changed in the mean time. The meaning then is that any democracy when it forgets it has to be fast and courageous in its decisions that should refuse red tape and bureaucracy will automatically fall in the hands of potential potentates or dictators. That is a common myth and political theme in the USA: the Roman Empire died after two centuries. Unluckily the Roman Empire was not the Republic of Rome and here Lucas is playing with our references. Are the USA a target of that decay of democracy? Yes indeed. That's the message today of this set of six beautiful films with great actors, even the perambulating carpet.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDBut then the meaning changed completely from that of the last three episodes that came first and could appear as a simple metaphor of the rebellion against a dictatorship, hence a metaphor of the defeat and disintegration of the Soviet Union for one.

B003ELOQD4|1.0|Completely lacking in brilliance or anything new, Bono and Co. just go thru the motions with their latest \\"Dog and Pony\\" show for another paycheck. This release truly confirms they are this era's most incredibly over rated bands and are mediocre at best.  Having been decades since the release of \\"The Joshua Tree\\", their last brilliant offering, U2 fans have become a hypnotized lot, buying anything that this long, since \\"gone\\" combo churns out for a quick buck. I find this latest endeavor for them yet another round in their perpetual spiral of insignificance. U2 joke of the day: What's the difference between Bono and Jesus Christ? Jesus doesn't walk around Dublin pretending he's Bono.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|Over the years I have seen every single Star Wars film in the movie theater, even the special editions during the nineties, and I can honestly say that I enjoyed them all. But when I saw that they made a  Clone Wars CGI animated movie, I thought to myself, \\"Why bother?\\" So as it goes I didn't bother to see that one in the theater. Recently I began watching all of the old films again starting with episode one to see how well they hold up (I still love 'em.) and so it was that I wanted even more Star Wars to entertain me and soon I decided that I would give The Clone Wars a try.<br /><br />The movie takes place between episodes 2 and 3 and has some familiar characters such as Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Count Dooku, Mace Windu, General Grievous, Senator Palpatine, C-3PO, R2-D2, and Jabba The Hutt. The plot involves the kidnapping of Jabba The Hutt's Son by Dooku and his gang in an attempt to lay the blame on the Jedis in order to cause the Hutt's to join the separatist's movement against the Republic.<br /><br />Upon it's release the movie received many negative reviews some of which compared it to a Saturday Morning Cartoon, which to be honest, it basically is. And of course there is now the Clone Wars TV show that followed it now airing on TV. Yet despite all of that, I still enjoyed the movie a lot. It had it's moments and I really enjoyed the excellent CGI animation and thought the battles and spaceships and scenery and characters and lightsaber fights were all very well done. The only downside that I can think of is the character  Ahsoka Tano, who is a Padawan to Anakin Skywalker. She's an okay character and has some good scenes in the movie, but she's a little too cutesy for my liking. Plus, I have to agree with some previous critic's opinions that it seems a little strange to have Anakin mentoring a Padawan, especially when you know a lot of his history in the prequels. Otherwise, it's a very cool Saturday Morning CGI cartoon movie.<br /><br />I noticed a lot of bad reviews for this movie and I can understand why a lot of people would be turned off by it, but I am not one of them. I can look at this as being a whole different part of the Star Wars universe and enjoy it for what it is. A whole new chapter of CGI animated stories for children to enjoy, and also older teens and adults who still have their inner child within them. I have to admit that my inner child liked The Clone Wars movie a lot and now looks forward to viewing The Clone Wars animated series.this movie and I can understand why a lot of people would be turned off by it, but I am not one of them.

B002R5V7MG|2.0|First, let me say that I admire Gustavo Dudamel's energy and positive attitude towards classical music and his demeanor on the podium and off is always professional. What I can't understand about this performance is his choice in repertoire. I watched this concert when it came on PBS. I do not own the DVD, so I can't comment on the DVD's presentation. I can comment on what I saw and heard that night as I watched this concert, allow me to break it down for you:<br /><br />1. Performance:<br /><br />-This is one aspect of this concert that I am not impressed with at all. One major problem is with the repertoire. A John Adams' piece? I mean is this the best they could do? Apparently, this is the premiere of this work titled \\"City Noir.\\" Quite honestly there was nothing about this work that was interesting. It sounded like a terrible emulation of Gerswhin. It is obviously jazz-inspired, but this just doesn't cut it with me. Dudamel's own conducting is far from convincing in this work as well. He seems overly cautious and his attention to the detail and the inner-workings are not well-defined. \\"City Noir\\" just doesn't add up to much anything. There's nothing for the listener to grab onto. Again, it just sounds like Adams has spent too much time trying to compose something hip and modern without giving much attention to matters of the heart.<br /><br />The Mahler 1st performance fairs a bit better but not by much. The first movement is terribly sluggish. Again, Dudamel is hesitating. Things start to get a bit more aggressive towards the last two movements as if Dudamel has finally found his own niche in the music. If the first movement was given the proper amount of attention, then it would have been an overall fine performance, but Dudamel clearly doesn't demonstrate that much authority in Mahler yet. I'm not sure if he ever will, but right now I don't hear anything remotely interesting coming from his baton in this work.<br /><br />2. Audio quality:<br /><br />-The audio quality is some of the worst I've heard in a modern live performance. It seems rather unfocused and lacks clarity especially in the string section where they almost seem to be drowned out by the other sections, especially brass and percussion.<br /><br />3. Visual quality/videography:<br /><br />-I'm impressed with the visual side of this concert. Everything is clear, the brights, and contrasts are just right. The camera work is also nicely done. It seems to focus more on the orchestra than on Dudamel's facial expressions. All orchestral sections are well filmed.<br /><br />This is a DVD I would not recommend to fans of classical music. The main reason is the performance and the choice of repertoire. In my opinion, Dudamel is most at home in Latin American music. Hopefully, there will be more DVD concerts to come, but I only hope that more attention and consideration is given to the music and the overall performance.d in a modern live performance.

1406303631|5.0|This is my grandson's all time favorite book.  I purchsed this book for my grandson. I am pleased with the book itself as it is a nice size with good clear pictures.  The DVD is the cutest little show and my grandkids both love to watch it.  My only dissappoinment was that the DVD is not a USA video so it will not play on my DVD players. We set our computer to the right setting and the children love the show but they can't watch it as often as they would if it would play on our players.  My grandsons are 4 yrs and 16 months.  I would also like to add that I read this book in my 4 year old preschool class and it is a favorite.  I Highly recommend this book with or without the DVD.
B0009SOFGI|4.0|What can be said? 1st off nice job by Rhino on the remaster & the out takes from the LP or alt mixes. Good product & value. I wished other labels would take heed with how to do a proper reissue. The Stooges debuet was hated by the critics & most liklely anyone outside of Ann Arbor MI. This was a cold slap in the face of everything hippy & groovy. Yes, the times were changing & Iggy was one of it's main catalysts. The Stooges really didnt have it all together & some of the songs were actually written \\"on the fly\\" in the studio (Real Cool Time comes to mind). These guys were in your face DIY way ahead of its time. I liked the vibe that Cale created & they found a \\"sympathetic\\" producer in John Cale. This lp was only a hint at what was to come on thier Fun House. This release is raw but a bit \\"restrained\\" if that is possible. The band was pissed when they couldnt turn up to 11 but that fuzzy sound more than makes up for it. This is a great ground breaking \\"proto- punk\\" album if there ever was one. Buy it now!

B0009SOFFY|5.0|Great job by Rhino 1st of all. Other lables should take a look at how reissues get done right. The original trax remastered as good as digital will allow plus an extra disc of worthy out takes on this wild as hell rock experiment known as \\"Fun House\\". Few bands ever get this good & no I'm not talking about graduating from Berklee (please spare me!). The magic of the Stooges tends to creep up on you & then you are hooked without warning. The Stooges essential magic is thier ability to pummel the living hell out of a riff with Iggy floating in & out of the beat like a cross between Little Richard & Jerry Rosalie of the Sonics. Now, add to that a slight dash of avant-gard jazz sensability to achive total & all out anarchie & you have 1 of the most land mark rock & roll lps bar none. This LP has quite good dynamics from the ominous stomp of \\"Down On The Street\\" to the surreal & drugged out nod of \\"Dirt\\" to the screeching cresendo of \\"LA Blues/monster\\"....This LP will suck you in, wring you out & leave you wondering what hit you. Not to mention the \\"visionary\\" production of Don \\"Louie Louie\\" Gallucci. He basically dismantled the pristine Elecktra Studio in LA, took out most of the sound deadening or acoustical tiles, set up oriental rugs, the bands PA & let 'em rip. Ron Asheton did some minimal overdubs over the basics & that was the album. It 1 uped the 1st album & they really should've have used Mr Gallucci on Raw Power....Sorry Bowie.
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|So, you're a Keane fan are you? Well, I hope you haven't bought the new CD yet...if you have, I'm sorry. Keane's newest release is 8 songs long, clocking in at a whopping 31 minutes. Sure, the Beatles albums were often short and no one would say they weren't great...and there have been recent memorable releases that have barely stretched a half hour...Paper Tigers by Caesars jumps right to mind. However, upon closer look and listen, this Keane CD falls very short of being called a classic. You can start with saying it's really a 7 song CD that clocks in at just under 30 minutes, as track 1, \\"House Lights\\", is a minute and 24 seconds of nothing. \\"Back In Time\\", which follows, is a good song, but nothing that will make you forget standout songs from past Keane CD's. When it's over, it's left your head. That's followed by the official single, \\"Stop For A Minute\\", which sounds extremely promising until guest rapper, K'Naan, sings lines like \\"Baby, you are just beautiful from your crown to your cuticles\\". Sadly, that gem might be one of the better lines and it makes me cringe every time I hear it. I'm certainly not against rap...even if it doesn't quite fit Keane's style...but I am against bad rap. The song \\"Clear Skies\\" follows, and it's easily the highlight of the CD. With hand claps and vivid lyrics, Keane makes you wonder if the ship has been righted and we're set for smooth sailing. But then \\"Ishin Denshin (You've Got To Help Yourself)\\" starts to play and you vomit a little in your mouth. I don't know what guest vocalist Tigarah is singing in Japanese, but if it's as syrupy sweet as the English lyrics, I don't want to know. I skip this song more than any other on the CD, which is saying a lot. Next up is \\"Your Love\\"...another song which makes you think things are headed in the right direction. \\"Looking Back\\", another song with guest vocalist K'Naan, follows and it's not much better than the first he guested on. Lines like \\"hard to separate my past from a rhyme, cause how could you separate milk from lime\\" will leave you scratching your head. Instead of thinking things are going to get better, you start to wonder if this Canadian singer/rapper has some incriminating photos of the guys in the band? Or maybe this is some cruel joke? Did Keane have to finish out a contract? Finally, mercilessly, the CD ends with \\"My Shadow\\"...which ends the CD on a decent note...if you didn't pop it out of your CD player before then.    Bottom line...if you're a big Keane fan, I highly recommend you stay away from this CD, or else you may be scarred for life. If you feel you must own some new music from Keane, definitely download \\"Your Love\\" and \\"Clear Skies\\". And if you can get an edited version of \\"Stop For A Minute\\", minus the rap...go there too. Otherwise...pop Hopes & Fears, Under The Iron Sea, or even Perfect Symmetry into your CD player...you'll be much happier you did.
B001WCN232|3.0|From time to time I do dust off my vinyl of this & spin both sides for a pretty satisfying 70's stones listen. But, \\"Heads\\" is a bit of a let down coming on the heels of the massive rollicking good time known as Exile. If you could put a \\"hangover\\" to music, then this be it. Somber trax like \\"Coming Down Again\\" \\"Angie\\" & \\"100 Yrs\\" are all good in thier way but kinda leave me a bit bumbed out feeling. I think this was also the last for Jimmy Miller as thier producer as well. It really doesnt have the classic ear marks of his production & it feels like the \\"twins\\" were wrestling control from him. This was the begining of the end for them but that is not to say its a bad LP. Its actually pretty good but like I said a bit of a bummer. Silver Train & Star really rock. It's too bad about \\"Star\\" being censored.....Mick said it best re Ed Sullivan's censoring, \\"Its us, then the washing machine, then us....whats the point?\\".....Bravo Mick.

B002ZCY7SW|5.0|I watched the final season of 24 not knowing at the time that it was in fact the LAST season. I thought that Jack was going to be back at least for one more run. But it was not to be. I got hooked on 24 with the fourth season and I've been hooked ever since. A lot of viewer felt that maybe Jack was watered down a bit. Certainly the 4th season brought on a lot of protests from the Muslim groups which caused some rewritting of episodes and scripts. (Buy/see the interviews on the season 4 dvd). Prison Break made a good attempt at the magic and was even added to the Monday night lead in for 24. But it was short lived. 24 broke ground by being gritty and at times graphic. Jack was/is the greatest anti-hero this side of Marvel's Punisher. This last season had Jack finding happiness but then losing it in an instance. He became even darker than at any time during the run of the show. For that moment, Jack was back. But now he gone and worst yet, on the run. From the United States and Russian governments. Will there be a 24 feature motion picture? I sure hope so. If not, we will forever be wondering, What is going on with Jack Bauer and what is he up to? Jack Bauer is now and forever more an American icon. A true patriot. May Jack live on forever on dvd and blue ray.

0802473156|5.0|The author, Gary Chapman, has a wealth of experiences coming from actual marriage counseling. He started by underlining that love begins or should begin at home. Very often in a marriage crisis, a primary key problem or element that was overlooked, a fundamental truth, is that people do speak different love languages. A healthy marriage means the ability to speak the love language of your spouse. He underlined the 5 love languages; words of affirmation, gifts, physical touch, acts of service and quality time. And within each love language comes many dialects or sub-groups.    Within the love language of words of affirmation, comes the dialect encouraging words such as giving verbal compliments. Another dialect is kind words, spoken in a kind tone. In general, all of the dialects have in common the use of words to affirm one's spouse. Additional alternative is to give indirect words of affirmation, which is saying positive things about your spouse when he or she is not present.    If a person's primary love language is quality time, it could mean listening and focused attention with a refusal to be interrupted. A dialect could be a quality conversation with sincere eye contact. Another dialect could also be quality activities, when a couple spends time together doing an activity.    For the primary love language of receiving gifts, for some of us to become an effective gift giver, we may have to change our attitude about money. However, this does not necessarily imply lavish gifts, but could be as simple as gifts of self or presence, which could simply mean being present together with your spouse.    In terms of the love language acts of service, it can be seen as the act of love making requests and not demands. Just like in a parent-child relationship, since the child is young and needs guidance, the parent in this situation, having more experiences and therefore will tend to have more authority, often tends to make demands on the child in order to provide guidance.On the other hand, with request comes choice. Put simply, requests give direction to love but demands stop the flow of love. Therefore a spouse should request for acts of services such as cleaning up the laundry, and not impose this as a demand on the other spouse. In an unhealthy marriage, demand comes from a tyrant spouse and tends to make the other spouse belittled. On the other hand, by making requests, it is more on giving guidance and not ultimatums, affirming his/her worth and abilities. Acts of service could be as simple as making the beds every day, having the meal prepared and ready before your spouse returns home from work, etc.    For the love language of physical touch, love touches may be explicit and demands full attention such as a back rub or sexual foreplay, culminating in an intercourse. It could also be implicit and require only a brief moment such as putting your hand on his/her shoulder.    For all marriages or relationships, to love and to continue loving is a choice. Very often, the initial in-love experience simply happens in the normal context of male-female relationships, un-premeditated. It tends to temporarily meet one's emotional need for love. Our emotions soar with the thought that another person sees us as number one, that your spouse is willing to devote time and energy exclusively to this relationship. For a brief period, however long it lasts, emotional need for love is met. In time, however, we come down from that natural high, back to the real world and this is when problems start mounting. When he/she descends from that emotional high, he/she may start having the natural yearnings of unmet emotional needs. If one is unable to speak the love language of your spouse, eventually all communication channels will break down and the marriage or relationship is unable to sustain any longer.     Simply put, most couples get married when they still have the euphoric feelings of being in love. When these euphoric feelings evaporate sometime after marriage and differences begin to emerge, they often find themselves in conflict. With no positive plan for resolving conflicts, they often find themselves speaking harshly to each other. Harsh words create feelings of hurt, disappointment and anger. Over time, this may result in divorce or infidelity.    In reality, love is not our only emotional need. Among our basic needs are the need for security, self-worth, significance, etc. Love, however, interfaces with all of these. If you feel loved by your spouse, you can relax and feel secured.    Gary relates an actual counseling where a spouse wondered she can ever love her husband after all that he has done to her. Her husband was unwilling to seek counseling and therefore was very much a one-sided request for help and advice. Gary recommended a 6-month experiment where she was the only one who put in the efforts by trying to speak her husband's love languages. Over time, her husband had slowly over this same course of time, started to love her again and begin to learn to speak her love language as well. This is indeed an encouragement for someone who is the only one struggling to keep the marriage alive!    This book is recommended for any couple who desires a healthy marriage and seems to provide possible solutions for a world-wide mounting divorce rates.

0743455967|5.0|I kindled it, started reading it, and devoured it. It was conversational and funny.  The writing advice was poignant, even as it included tips that are not unique - how many ways can one tell others how to write? I was open to instruction and did not carry preconceived notions, so the advice was of value to me.  However, I did the writing exercise only to find out that submissions are no longer being accepted.  So, I will take Stephen's advice and keep writing.  In fact I will keep writing my homework assignment and submit it to AHMM.    Good luck everyone.  Thank you Stephen!
B000021Y7X|5.0|Given the relatively few good concert films that have been made, saying \\"Stop Making Sense\\" is the best of the lot might be akin to being proclaimed the best Shakespearian actor in Greenland. But \\"Stop Making Sense\\" is far better than that. A timeless, stirring, joyful celebration fueled by the relentless energy of David Byrne and the masterful performance of the Talking Heads.<br /><br />Beginning with the stark simplicity of \\"Psycho Killer\\" through the frenetic finish of \\"Cross-Eyed and Painless\\", the Heads are captured at their creative peak by the future Oscar-winning director Jonathon Demme. The film forgoes the boring interviews and needless crowd cutaways that drag down most concert films and begins with the feet of David Byrne who walks onto an empty stage to begin the concert. For the next six songs, the road crew assembles the rest of the set and the songs grow in power. The sound quality is astounding as they used a 24 track digital recorder (something unusual for late 1983) which gave the film a studio-quality sound especially in the bass, something that is lacking in most concert films.<br /><br />The highlights are many, but three that stand out begin with the energetic \\"Life During Wartime\\" where the band jogs in place during most of the song and has Byrne run around the stage at the end. \\"Girlfriend is Better\\" features the most iconic image of the film, Byrne in his famous \\"Big Suit\\" shimmying to the relentless rhythm that builds throughout. And finally the euphoric \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" featuring an unbroken 4+ minute shot of Byrne performing until the climax when the next cut shows the backup singers slowly rising up (a photo exists on the booklet). This combination of image and song still sends shivers up my spine, a unique, powerful moment of cinema.<br /><br />The DVD includes an informative commentary track featuring all the \\"Heads\\" and director Demme. Three bonus songs that were not included in the original theatrical release, a storyboard to film comparison, the original film trailer and most bizarre, a four minute interview of David Byrne wearing his \\"Big Suit\\" being interviewed by...David Byrne, who goes through a variety of changes (Please Mr. Byrne, never dress as a woman again...please).<br /><br />This is an absolute must-have DVD for music fans, not just the Talking Heads ones. A film that captures one of the most creative forces in rock at their thrilling peak with top-notch sound and imaginative cinematography. And the show is just as fresh today as it was when I first saw it back in '84. A testiment to the enormous talent of David Byrne and vision of Demme.iginal film trailer and most bizarre, a four minute interview of David Byrne wearing his \\"Big Suit\\" being interviewed by...David Byrne, who goes through a variety of changes (Please Mr. Byrne, never dress as a woman again...please).

0545123275|5.0|This book has been summarized enough. I just want to add that I love the story of Grace and Sam. They are the epitome of mystical romance and it's been a long time since I've read a book that left me feeling like I knew the characters first hand.<br />I am really looking gorward to the sequel.
030726999X|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is one of the all-time-great action heroes: a ninety-pound child-sized woman who can seriously disable a humongous thug. Covered with tattoos and piercings, she's deeply withdrawn and belongs to a secret club of hackers. We meet her this time in the hospital with a bullet in her head, hip and shoulder, and multiple murder charges awaiting her if she recovers.<br /><br />Journalist Mikael Blomkvist, a brilliant journalist and once Salander's lover, is determined to expose the lies and schemes that have falsely branded Salander a sociopathic killer.<br /><br />Salander's story is intertwined with a sinister group inside the Swedish security police (SIS) called The Section. The SIS has no idea it harbors this ruthless elite within its ranks. The Section built a whole espionage network around Salander's father, Zalachenko, a Soviet defector. Even after the Cold War is over, Zalachenko and the unsavory secrets he knows have to be protected. This involves declaring his daughter Lisbeth mentally incompetent and keeping her locked up as much as possible.<br /><br />It's important to read the first two books in the Millennium trilogy first, so you already know Salander's horrific life story. This book is really the final flushing out of all the nasty people who have persecuted her since childhood and the righting of her wrongs. There's a lot of tricky detective work, and a very satisfying courtroom scene.<br /><br />Now and then the author stops the action to discuss women warriors throughout history. This is his real subject, I think. There are several amazing women warriors in his plot, not only Salander but also a gorgeous giantess of a secret agent, a belligerent woman bodyguard and a tough editor.<br /><br />I loved the Millennium trilogy. The world now has a powerful new cultural icon in the girl who kicked the hornet's nest.
B000UJ48XG|4.0|This review comes a little late seeing as I purchased this CD several years ago. There is something very special about this band and its revival of this type of music. The dynamic of instruments used in each song is also very impressive.    However I cant say this music is for everyone. I tried sharing it with a few other people who felt it wasnt good because you couldnt \\"dance\\" to it. Others told me each song sounded the same.    Granted this is not the type of music to impress your average pop princess so much as it stirs the imagination. If you have ever paused at the sound of Edith Piaf singing La Vie En Rose on a grainy record, feeling as though you were transported back in time to a culture and language you never belonged to... Beirut goes about creating the same sort of magic.    I urge you to watch Beirut's \\"Elephant Gun\\" which sets the stage to a sort of ongoing party thats part circus and part lingerie party. Beirut wants to seduce you the old fashioned way.    In conclusion, this music may not impress all people however it is a refreshing break from all things on the radio.
0316017922|1.0|Gladwell's analyses of various issues from the beginning of \\"Outliers\\" seemed convincing to start with. However, with the \\"ethnic theory of plane crashes\\" he got on to something I actually knew about. I have had 35 years as an international airline captain, working extensively on this very subject for both my own airline and the global pilots' organisations. This chapter revealed that the shallowness of his research can lead Gladwell to sweepingly inept and arguably racist conclusions, resulting from the just the same type of cultural biases he criticises in others.     The \\"ethnic theory of plane crashes\\" starts with a valid and important issue: that the relationship between crew members in an airliner cockpit, communications skills, and workload management are crucial factors in determining whether the outcome of an event is benign or catastrophic. Unfortunately, Gladwell reaches the simplistic and possibly racist conclusion that people from some countries will inevitably make bad pilots and have lots of accidents, because he totally fails to understand that the situations he describes were not solely the result of simplistic \\"national\\" cultures.     In fact the dominant issue is the internal culture of the individual airline, in which \\"national\\" culture is just one of many factors. What is most critical are the procedures that dictate how individual tasks are allocated between the two pilots. This is the responsibility of each airline and is based strongly on its interpretation of the airplane manufacturer's handbook - and historically the major suppliers have been from the USA.     What Gladwell terms as \\"piloting\\" is actually a number of quite different tasks that need to be shared, particularly during the approach to landing when most accidents occur. Gladwell hits this point (without recognising it) when he endorses the attitude of a pilot friend who says \\"when I had a problem, I said to the First Officer \\"you fly the plane\\"\\".   This meant that he (the Captain) could concentrate on the critical tasks of overseeing and managing the flight, and communicating effectively. These are exactly the aspects for which Gladwell criticises the Korean and Colombian pilots. Yet he never asks \\"why didn't the Colombian and Korean pilots do that?\\"     The bottom line is recognising that \\"piloting\\" involves more than just immediate hands on the airplane controls, but strategic planning, communication, and systems management - and one person can't safely do all of them at the same time in an airliner, even if you can in a small plane. Most of the time, being the \\"hands-on pilot\\" is a lot less critical (and prone to error) than the other things.     Gladwell notes that the frequency of accidents (even in the US) is much higher when the Captain is in direct control of the airplane. He is apparently quite unaware that this has been recognised in the airline industry for over 60 years, especially outside the USA. Simply changing an airline's \\"crew co-ordination\\" procedures so that the co-pilot normally flies the approach, preparatory to the Captain making the actual landing, hugely reduces the frequency of the type of accident Gladwell describes, and is widely recommended by major air safety organisations. It is exactly what Gladwell approvingly notes his pilot friend Ratwatte does with his Helsinki medical diversion example. It is widely documented in recommendations after accident investigations, but crucially is not part of the basic procedures provided by the airplane manufacturers, because their handbook only describes how to do the individual tasks. So they will say, for example during the landing, \\"Pilot flying does X, other pilot helps by doing Y\\".     Gladwell's research clearly got as far as a couple of accident reports, but rather than make any deeper analysis of the problem, he much prefers to provide specious detail from voice recorder transcripts. This lets him make his pre-judged national cultural point. If he had dug any deeper, he would inevitably have been asking why these simple procedure changes are still not widely implemented across the entire international airline industry, as they address precisely the issues of power-distance index, Captain-First Officer (cross-cockpit) authority gradient, mitigation in communication, effective Crew Resource Management, and all the other technical terms which he throws around with apparent authority.     Why didn't Gladwell dig any deeper? I suspect it is because his own cultural bias simply told him he needn't bother to look any further. He just assumed that because the US has the lowest ranking of plane crashes by country (to use his rather simplistic approach to accident statistics), simply forcing other cultures to apply an \\"American attitude to piloting\\" will fix problems elsewhere. Unfortunately, it can't and won't work if that is believed to be the only change needed - as Gladwell appears to think.     The fact is that the American airline industry IS generally very safe, and as a direct result provides the model for many other countries. Many US airlines HAVE implemented changed procedures for some conditions, but even the US industry it is not perfect and still needs to make changes. But as Gladwell points out, the USA scores highest for individualism on Hofstede's \\"individualism-collectivism\\" scale. For that reason, American pilots are among the most reluctant in the world to accept the idea that as a normal procedure, flying an airliner in the 21st century should be regarded as a shared task - which is what is ACTUALLY required. Gladwell should be pushing that idea, not just in the \\"high PDI culture airlines\\" whose ethnicity he thinks makes them inherently bad pilots, but in the USA as well - and not only because the nature of aviation is such that much of the world simply follows US practices. Gladwell is not entitled to simply say that an entire nation's aviation activity is unsafe, unless they change their whole cultural backgroundand social etiquette to be more American, which is what he is in effect saying.     Gladwell starts out with an important public safety issue. He makes an initially plausible sounding analysis, but this is actually seriously flawed by his own cultural and other biases. As a result he spirals into some completely improper conclusions, for which he has gained a lot of publicity. Before writing this review I tried to communicate with him, but my messages have not been acknowledged, and I can only conclude that his \\"Ethnic theory of plane crashes\\" is more important to him than actually addressing the issues he's raised. That to me completely undermines the value of anything he writes or says. In the end, this chapter is worse than worthless. We have a high profile \\"intellectual\\" apparently analysing an important issue. Through ignorance he advocates an inappropriate solution, albeit one that will find a ready audience. What is hard to forgive is that by doing so he has made it harder to get the right one implemented. And in the industry he is talking about that will cost lives.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|I found myself really loving this album! It ranges from mellow, to beautiful, to shouting climax with songs like \\"Mr. November\\". The lyrics touch base on interesting relationships that have you empathising with his immaturity or loss, than hating his ego for childish antics.    The lyrics are clever, each song is fresh and something new. It doesnt exactly cater to women like music from John Mayer or Michael Buble. But it's not as apathetic or indifferent as something from Pete Yorn. There is a relatable and even desirable quality about this music.    Overall, I'd highly reccomend Alligator for the range it covers as well as the content.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|This is a fantastic CD.  \\"No place like home\\" is one of the best songs I have ever heard. If you like Devo or just great music,you must pick up this album now!!!!!!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I was shocked to read that these musicians suffered a lot of family deaths, almost all at once, that this album is inspired and dedicated to. The birth of this music comes from a very interesting place... and I dont know if thats what made it amazing and unique or that this band as a whole is bound for stardom.    The energy, the lyrics, the vocals, all of it is powerful and fun. I wasnt impressed with mabye two of the songs for being drawn out or too high pitched. But that should not deter you.    I really love the CD as a whole.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|Once again, Discovery Network thought that the original BBC narrator, naturalist David Attenborough was too \\"intellectual\\" for \\"dumb Americans\\" to relate. Perhaps they presumed that Americans wouldn't be able to understand a man with an accent.     More likely, Oprah demanded the position as narrator. She's an admitted fan of the Planet Earth series, and now has partnered with Discovery Networks to have her own channel. We all know she's a narcissist. She always puts herself on the cover of her own magazine every month, which she named after herself and her TV show, which is also named after herself.    Oprah's voice is abrasively post-menopausal, and she speaks condescendingly, with an irritating monotone, as though she's addressing an audience of unruly children.     Just like the narration, the writing has been hideously dumbed down for the dumbed down masses that Discovery Networks believe Americans to be.     Before watching Life, I was neutral about Oprah. But now, I hold nothing but contempt for the snarky, condescending witch that would have ruined the series if weren't for the availability of the BBC version. I finally understand why so many people hated Oprah for so long.    I don't know about anyone else, but the notion that Americans are too stupid to understand a well-spoken Brit is foolish, and quite offensive to Americans and English alike.     My $0.02
0525423842|2.0|I only kept reading this because I had nothing else on stand-by.  Otherwise, this book would have been easy to walk away from.  Kept thinking that it was so similar to an Encyclopedia Brown mystery, except this story wouldn't end after 5 pages.  It easily could have and I wouldn't have had to be subjected to loose threads, shallow characters, and a thin plot.  (Plus, the use of 'illegal' by one of the child characters to describe his cousin seemed jarring.  My experience with those that are here without papers -I work in public schools - is that they describe themselves as just that:  \\"without papers\\" not illegal.)
B003A4IFGY|4.0|Though there are no songs on Mojo that I would consider instant classics, the album works very well as a whole, maintaining its live bluesy feel. Mike Campbell's lead guitar is heavily featured, which is mostly a good thing. Campbell is my favorite guitar player of all time, and much of that has to do wtih his knack to always play the appropriate solo for any given song. The only time that any problems creep in is when the song seems to be there for the solo(s) rather than vice versa. Still, if you're going to feature any instrument, Campbell's guitar is always a great idea.<br /><br />\\"Running Man's Bible\\" ripples with energy. \\"Good Enough\\" reminds me of The Beatles' \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" with its long coda. \\"First Flash of Freedom\\" is like a sister-song to \\"Golden Rose\\" from Petty's Highway Companion album. \\"Something Good Coming\\" is the kind of beautiful slow song that Petty has perfected over the years . . .<br /><br />But singling out songs doesn't quite get to the point with Mojo, because this is an album that works more as a whole than as individual songs. It's a blues album from start to finish, and (time will tell if this is true) I'd say it's going to take off when performed live. No, this doesn't match Heartbreakers classics from 70s, 80s, and 90s, but it's a consistent, strong, and very enjoyable entry into the latterday Petty catalogue, fitting very well with the Highway Companion and Mudcrutch albums.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I watch alot of series but Breaking Bad takes the proverbial cake. This season we really get down and dirty with Walt going through his divorce and Skylar's anger causing her to react in all sorts of ways. I love the show mainly because it is about good people having to do bad things for different reasons. It makes the viewer really think. There are alot of grim moments this season, it is a grim show overall, always has been, but that is what makes it so genius. Season three is highly addictive and moves quickly with edge of your seat suspense in every epidode. There are never boring moments in Breaking Bad. Not only do we get to really get in Walt's mind, but Jesse gets a more pivotal role this season and I have to say I am glad. Jesse is one of my favorite characters and he has to makes hard decisions as so much is going on in his life. I find myself very drawn to Jesse's character and his turmoil. Walt is a sort of father figure to Jesse and something major happens that really shows the viewer what lengths Walt will go to for Jesse. How their relationship develops is touching at times and frustrating at others.  A new druglord is introduced which gives the show an overall tenseness and of course with Walt's brother in law's involvement it makes for some tense moments as well. The show is not light on violence and never sugarcoats what being a meth cooker would be like. There are all kinds of dilemmas and moral decisons to be considered. All in all it is a high octane season and every time the episode ends you just want more. I found myself crying throughout the procession of this season as there are alot of heavy circumstances. I love this show and can't wait until Season Four. The series finale leaves the viewer hanging so badly that I felt like screaming. Enjoy!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is much more better than the first book.There is much action and emotion. You get sick with the Capital's games.Try to understand what is the real deal all through the book,but I am really sorry about the ending.Not because it is bad.Because it makes you wait and wonder till the next book.
0061122416|3.0|I read this (in under a few hours) after hearing about it a hundred times. I liked the book very much and a few things will stay with me, but as is often the case I felt the hype was greater. Probably would have liked it better with fewer recommendations.<br />It's a fable which is good and not so good. I love lessons that often come from fables but there are elements of this one that feel materialistic. Isn't the ultimate lesson; love is the greatest reward? There were times it felt that hidden treasure was worth the risk of losing soul-mate style love and something about that felt odd (although I did like the way that was explained). Perhaps because the protagonist's lesson was to follow his dream which included hidden treasure, although it seemed that after doing that he could have his real reward which was love, so why can't he just skip to the love? You only get to experience everlasting love after following your dreams? Perhaps.<br />Is it a great fable? Maybe, but I still prefer The Little Prince, Illusions, Peaceful Warrior.<br />I also noticed the author openly talks about some major life secrets and lessons of the universe that are plain to anyone who wants to see by just blurting them out and telling us yet he avoids telling the reader what they really want by the end: the few words that can be written on a single emerald to explain it all. What are those words? Maybe I'm missing something like no words can be written on an emerald or maybe the message is spelled out within the plot, but it felt the author openly gave some appetizers while withholding the presumed entre at his convenience.<br />All in all, a very good tale that reminds us to make every effort to follow our dreams. That part will stay with me, so thank you, Paulo.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought the book,but did not start reading it as a protest until catching fire came out as a kindle version. My friends constantly kept saying I should read it.<br />Then I started reading,but couldn't continue for some time.The book is boring at the beginning,but that is a must in order to make the readers understand the environment and the events that will take place in the book.Once you get passed the boring part,you can not stop reading.I immediately read the second book \\"Catching Fire\\" and that ends worst.I do not know how I am going to wait for the last book to come out.A lot of questions are hanging now.
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|Love the band, but really despise this album.  Keane is from England, so they can be excused if they've failed to realize that rap completely sucks, requires no musical talent or ear for harmony, and is only listened to by criminals and wannabe thugs.
031606792X|1.0|I honestly wanted to like this book.  Really, truly I did.    Like many others I will readily admit that I was swept up in the Twilight craze.  Because we all must admit that beneath a sea of poor characterisation and painful alliteration, a truly interesting story is lurking.  I wanted desperately to care for the characters.  I wanted to see them grow, sacrifice, love, cry, despair, feel.  I trudged dutifully through the incessant, utterly boring angst that is New Moon.  I found my hopes being tentatively raised in Eclipse, wondering if perhaps Miss Stephenie was seeing the light; attempting, albeit a little late, to give her numerous characters some semblance of truly real, three dimensional personalities.      And then I read Breaking Dawn.    Never in my life have I read a more thinly veiled piece of pro-life propagandist absurdity.  Every aspect of the plot made me physically sick to my stomach - every word stuck like glue, refusing to be swallowed.  It sat in an angry, heavy lump at the back of my throat - growing bigger and more repulsive with every word I attempted to digest.  Every plot device, every characterisation, every piece of the beautiful (but shallow) world Stephenie had attempted to build in the previous three novels was utterly and completely decimated by this 754 page piece of badly written fangirl fiction.  Any sensible reader of this series should, like me, take every single chapter of this literary abomination as a personal slap in the face by Ms Meyer herself.    I wish that I was embellishing the truth here, but sadly I am not.    Despite being so painfully long, I could sum up the moral of this tale in a single, disgusting paragraph:  \\"Kids, don't abort your babies.  Babies are super special in every way and anyone with any semblance of a heart would never get rid of their child, no matter what their health, doctors, husbands, friends, family or pre-pregnancy personality say.  If you do have the baby, it'll probably turn out to be amazingly brilliant and talented, bringing joy and the only true love you'll ever know into your horrible existence.  Your life will be perfect, with every loose end tied into a neat little bow.  Don't abort babies! Oh yeah, and no sex before marriage either, that's just plain wrong too.  Marriage first, then dirty, headboard-breaking vampire sex.\\"    And honestly, this is the only discernible, infuriating tone I could gather from the book.  Don't abort, and your life will be amazing.  Don't have sex before marriage, and your first time will be pleasurable and perfect.  Everything Stephenie had ever told us  about who Bella and Edward were was carelessly pushed aside; giving way to two new, impossibly shallow, hulled-out shells.  Suddenly, despite Meyer's repetitive insistence that all Bella cared about in this world was Edward and her life with him, she will effortlessly throw her relationship aside in an attempt to save the half-human, half-vampire baby growing inside her?  Hang on, did I miss some important characterisation here? Point me to something, ANYTHING in the previous novels to assist me in believing that not only would Bella care for anything else beside her love for Edward, but that she would happily turn away from her now-consummated relationship for an unborn, dangerous, painful fetus because she \\"suddenly realised\\" she wanted to be a mother? At 19? Without ever, EVER indicating anything other discomfort and indifference toward children?  And poor Edward, once a brooding, infatuated lover who would do anything at all to protect his Bella now finds himself as nothing more than a cardboard cutout advocate for the \\"perfect family\\" ?  Stephenie, you can't have it both ways.  You can't create square characters and then attempt to force them through round holes.  You can't create personalities that clash with your own morals and standards, then attempt to force them into a mould of yourself at the eleventh hour.    By no means is the blatant pro-life propaganda the only infuriating aspect of this book.  Not only did Meyer attempt to change her main characters to suit her propagandist message, she changed the rules of her OWN world to suit her storyline of choice.  I had been explicitly made to believe in previous books that Vampires could not get pregnant as their bodies are frozen in time and cannot physically change.  How is it, then, that Edward can sire a baby with sperm that is over 100 years old?  For this to happen, 1) The sperm that was in Edward's body at his time of transformation did not turn into venom, as \\"All fluids of the body\\" should, 2) In all those 100 odd years, even considering his proclamations of being a virgin, Edward never once masturbated? (I find this difficult to believe) and 3) That the sperm in his body from when he was transformed (as it must have been, as Vampires cannot 'create' new bodily fluids) somehow managed to survive in his cold, barren body for over 100 years, leaving his body in viable enough condition to impregnate a human girl.  Umm...    This is only one example of the constant inaccuracies dotting Meyer's extremely flawed story.  As a fan to other fans, read Eclipse and end the series there.  Imagine your own ending.  This book is cliched and fanfiction-y at best, an absolute disaster and emotional slap in the face at worst.  Don't be utterly shattered at this literary abomination as I was,  just save yourself the money and unnecessary emotion.   Unless you like to have pro-life propaganda forced down your throat in the form of YA fiction.
B00006IU73|5.0|Having considered myself a person 'in the know' about rock music, imagine my surprise when I recently heard \\"The Creator Has A Mastertape\\", and had never heard  of Porcupine Tree before. WOW, am I glad I heard that song, because it is merely the tip of a truly CLASSIC set of songs that I am really, really glad I happened upon.     All of the glowing words that decribe this CD have already been posted in previous reviews, so I can only add that they are all TRUE! In Absentia is one of those CD's that comes along once every couple of years, and its really a shame I had to wait 8 years to find it.

B002RSDW80|4.0|Julie & Julia is a sweet and well-acted film about the life of French cook, Julia Child. Meryl Streep does a fine job but I was more impressed by Amy Adams. Adams is an actress who can do a little of everything: comedy, drama, rom-com, and musicals - she is that good, her range is incredible. I really felt the connection Julie had with her idol, Julia and all those dishes she had to prepare, how exhausting! This movie was fun and made me hungry, definitely worth checking out, enjoy!
1439153663|5.0|Though this is a book a story about a hard life, the story line keeps you wanting to know what becomes of the characters. And when you think you know how it ends, you find out that it doesn't. I couldn't put it down! I wanted to finish it as fast as a could!
0439023491|4.0|It's been about two and a half days since I picked up The Hunger Games and became completely consumed with these books.  In that span, I have rabidly read both the first and the second novels and, were it possible to do so, I would already be starting on the third.  I'm glad that I came into the series a bit late as I only have to wait until August to find out how the story concludes.<br /><br />Catching Fire is something of a bridge and, as such, contains perhaps a bit less spark (pun intended) than the first.  In all fairness, I'd rate it at 4.5 stars as I enjoyed it nearly as much as the first book, but just not quite.  I have no desire to give the book away, so I'll speak in what are hopefully broad terms here when I say that I thought the biggest problem with this book is that the Capitol just gets too sadistic.  Now, that's not to say that they weren't sadistic in the first, just that their extreme reaction to Katniss and Peeta's subversive victory seems designed to promote their own downfall.  When insurrection is a-brewing, it's perhaps not the best time to be bringing out all of your heavy weapons.  This made me lose faith in the books just a bit because it seems as though President Snow and, by extension, the Capitol are suffering a bit from stupid villainitis, which is an illness that I find particularly vexing.  But maybe that's Collins's intent.  At any rate, it did create some ripples in my suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />However, what I do really like about this novel is that it is more reflective than the first.  While the first certainly makes you think, it also had something of a lurid quality.  I'm not necessarily knocking it as I think that the basic premise called for at least some degree of luridness.  In fact, this in and of itself is enough to make the reader pause and think about the incomprehensible nature of brutal regimes like that of the Capitol.<br /><br />But I digress a bit.  While I was very, very impressed by the first novel, I did find that the violence and savagery of the games got to me after a bit.  It made sense to me that the tributes would more or less break down into a very basic kill or be killed mentality, but it didn't give the reader a very big picture of the world of Panem in and of itself.  This book, on the contrary, does so.  There are particular passages in the book that I found very striking, such as Katniss's reaction to a stylish Capitol liqueur, her encounter with some refugees from another district, and her growing awareness that her own district perhaps enjoyed something of a lack of the sheer brutality experienced by the people in other districts.  There are hints of all of these things in the first novel, but I found them to be much more fleshed out here.  By contrasting the terrible things that are happening in the districts with the attitudes of the people who live in the Capitol, I felt Collins actually did a better job of showing how indifference and ignorance can be almost more offensive than outright brutality.  After all, isn't this a reflection of our own world?  When we're so caught up in what's happening in our own house, it's easy to ignore the atrocities right outside of our door.  This book makes Panem more of a character, which I think is to the series's benefit.<br /><br />As for the love triangle between Katniss, Gale, and Peeta, I'm actually pretty convinced by it.  It's important to remember that Katniss has some very, very good reasons for insisting on not falling in love.  As I read, I often found myself wondering why other people don't think more like her and do their best to avoid bringing children into such a horrifying world.  However, as Katniss shows, sometimes the heart wants what the heart wants.  But what is it that her heart wants?  I can pretty easily see how someone of Katniss's mentality, someone who has been through so much trauma it's a wonder she can get out of bed in the morning might have some trouble disentangling her emotions.  That Gale is her friend cannot be questioned.  But what, exactly, is the nature of her love for him?  That Peeta has been her savior is equally unquestionable.  But does she care for him so deeply because the intense trauma that they survived has engendered a sense of debt in her, or does she love him because he is so clearly a kind and noble person?  These aren't easy questions to answer, and it doesn't surprise me that Katniss seems entirely incapable of answering them at this point in the series.<br /><br />In the meantime, I'll need to try to find something to keep myself occupied until I can finally read the conclusion to this compelling, disturbing, and deeply layered tale.  Collins has crafted a really impressive work of literature and it is one I will definitely be recommending to friends..  That Gale is her friend cannot be questioned.

B002ZG99CC|5.0|I'm from the old school but I prefer the Karate Kid re-make over the original!    I loathe the day that I become \\"old\\" and fear new takes on old art.   It won't happen to me because I keep an open mind; but sadly, many others don't.    In 2010 we get a remake with much better fight scenes and deeper emotions.   The movie is visually stunning and -- what can I say -- simply brilliant!    The audience was captured for 2.5 hours and gave a standing ovation at the end.    Magnificent!!
B00008OE4W|4.0|I saw this first in VHS and loved it. A team of Hackers are hired to break in to peoples business to see if they are as safe as they think. But when the NSA shows up and askes them to take up a whole new job, break into a mathematician's office and steal a little black box. Upon stealing the box the team discovers a secret, this box can hack into any US computer system.<br /><br />Great Movie and worthy of your DVD collection.
0061649694|4.0|I saw the movie before reading the book, so I knew to expect a creepy kid's story.     While not as scary or creepy as I was expecting it to be (I read reviews stating that the book is sooooo much creepier than the movie!), there were a few parts in the book that weren't in the movie and added to the creepiness of the story.     If you like weird creepy kid books, don't miss this one by Neil Gaiman!
B002GSXKN8|4.0|Even though half of these movies are not good, this is still a real find. The two good movies of the mid-era on one disc is both convenient and worth the price by themselves. Really, though, if you can find them both on separate DVDs for about the same money, about the only thing you'll be out is additional shipping and handling. I consider this being less worth the cost for having the later two movies included.    I can't do it! I can't not say anything about Batman and Robin! Its so bad! Its really bad! Its Mystery Science Theater 3000 bad! Its the saddest movie ever made. Not in the sentimental way, not in the tragic way. It just makes me very sad. Batman Forever, while far less bad, is no picnic either. Jim Carrey can be The Riddler, but why is The Riddler Jim Carrey? If you're looking for Riddler, Two-Face, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy and even Bane and Batgirl, you'd be better off trying to find the animated series. Michael Gough's Alfred is the best performance and has the best writing on disc two by a disappointingly wide margin.    That said, Batman and Batman Returns are awesome! Some of Tim Burton's finest reality-based work, well cast. Brilliantly scored. These movies have some of the most perfect Batman music, including the two Nolan movies. And no matter where you stand on Nicholson vs Ledger for best Joker (I like Hamill myself), you've got to admit that on his own merits, Jack makes for an outstanding Clown Prince of Crime. Hes threatening and at the same time really funny in that special Joker way, the way he should be.    Oh, and Keaton was good as Bats.    Should you buy it? Well...about ten bucks for a whole set of movies is pretty much always a good deal, and when that set includes two classics, so much the better. I would say reserve disc two for one of those times you're looking for a movie to mock and tell yourself you only paid for disc one. Nobody should ever pay money for Batman and Robin unless it includes a night with Catwoman afterward.

B002PLALCO|5.0|PINK is wonderful; I am a huge fan of hers. The only critisism I have is that some of the numbers are repeated from the Live in Wembley Stadium, London DVD. She is soo talented, I am amazed she hasn't got more recognition. This is one of the best pop DVDs ever!
0545128285|5.0|J.K. Rowling has done it again! Readers who enjoyed the grand adventures of Harry, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore and the rest of the memorable characters will findTHE TALES OF BEEDLE THE BARD a valuable tome of literature harvested straight from HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS. Remember the book that Dumbledore gave to Hermione, the one that, with great difficulty, she translated into the wizarding fables that help our beloved Trio on their journeys? Now, with never-before-seen commentary from Albus Dumbledore himself, five of Beedle's tales have been made available to wizards and Muggles alike. Enjoy!    On \\"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\\":    People from miles around come to get help from a well-beloved wizard, but when he dies at a happy age, his son inherits everything, including the wizard's calling. The problem is, the son doesn't like the non-magical folk and doesn't want anything to do with them. No visits. No help. No healings. No nothing.    But when village folk begin showing up at the son's door, in need of help, strange things begin to happen, and all the strangeness centers on his father's old cooking pot. If he had his father's character and goodness, he might be able to handle it all, but he, of course, does not. Prejudiced against all non-magical people and desiring only to please himself, his life begins to fall apart, and he must figure out what kind of person he will be if he hopes to survive the chaos.    On \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune\\":    Once each year on the longest day, the enchanted garden lets one person try to drink from the Fountain's magical waters. On one particular year, three witches tie themselves together in hopes of sharing the fortunate blessing with each other, should the garden choose them to enter. Things do not go according to plan, though, as a pitiful-looking knight is pulled into the garden with them. Their difficult journey to the fountain teaches them about the illusion of fair fortune and the joy of real contentment.    On \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\\":    In this, the most gruesome of the five tales, a talented young warlock notices how foolish people become when they fall in love and vows never to fall in love himself. Using the Dark Arts to his \\"advantage,\\" he removes his heart and hides it deep in the dungeon of his castle. Family, friends and indeed the whole kingdom wish him to find love, but he laughs at them all, until the rumors about him begin to spread. After having his heart closed off for so long, it becomes the hairiest journey imaginable for him to learn to love again.    On \\"Babbitty Rabbitty and Her Cackling Stump\\":    A foolish king turns his Brigade of Witch-Hunters loose on the countryside to hunt down and arrest any magical folk. At the same time, however, he puts out an advertisement wanting an Instructor in Magic. Spying the perfect opportunity to make a quick buck, a clever charlatan pretends to be a sorcerer and goes to work for the king. All goes well until someone finds out his secret. In classic form, the foolish king shows us the kind of fear that can be created when the people in power label a certain group as the evil ones in society. Racism and prejudice are soon to follow. As providence would have it, though, someone always rises up who puts the prideful in his place, showing him where he has gone astray and leaving we readers satisfied that justice has won the day again.    On \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\":    When three brothers figure out a way to cheat Death, he pretends to congratulate them by offering them each a prize. The three prizes --- the most powerful wand, a stone with the power to recall others from Death, and an Invisibility Cloak --- lead the brothers down eerily similar paths. Even with such powerful tools, they cannot run from Death. Indeed, it seems no one can.    This tale is showcased in HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, as Harry and Hermione learn that the three prizes are real and that all of wizarding history seemsto center on the hunt for the three items. Without giving any of Harry's story away, the parallels between this tale and the end of Harry's journey intertwine nicely for a pleasing payoff and a strong message.    On Dumbledore's Commentary:    After each of the five tales, Rowling has included commentary by Albus Dumbledore. In these commentaries, Dumbledore sheds light on bits of wizarding history and shows how they help expound the stories' meanings. Readers will enjoy interesting tidbits from Dumbledore's past, stories about Hogwarts and interesting background details about the struggle between The Order and the Death Eaters and the evil practice of creating Horcruxes. Even though events from the past cannot be changed, for this reader, it certainly was great to hear Dumbledore's voice again.    Final Thoughts:    Beatrix Bloxam, an author from Harry and Dumbledore's wizarding world, believes that Beedle's tales are \\"damaging to children, because of what she called `their unhealthy preoccupation with the most horrid subjects, such as death, disease, bloodshed, wicked magic, unwholesome characters, and bodily effusions of the most disgusting kind.\\" I, however, believe the opposite. THE TALES OF BEEDLE THE BARD contains five enjoyable and easy-reading fables that we Muggles will be able to learn from and enjoy. The subjects of the stories are just what people should be talking about, and these tales offer much opportunity for conversation and re-reading.    My thanks go out to Hermione Granger for all her hard work translating Beedle's tales from the ancient runes and to J.K. Rowling for bringing Harry Potter back into our world again, even if for a brief enjoyable moment.
B0013GSQH4|5.0|The product received was exactly as described by the seller.  Quick response and Delivery.  Great seller!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|First I have to say I appreciate Amazon, had a problem and Amazon made it right, though I don't believe it was actually an Amazon problem.    The blu ray Life disks were excellent and David Attenborough was much easier to listen to than the Opera Life series, as I had watched that on the Discovery channel. The BBC version was slightly different, in a good way and both versions had astoungingly great shots. I would have liked Mike Rowe to have narrated this release, however even though David Attenborough is getting on he still did a fabulous job.    The Life series is becoming part of the collection of great wildlife documentaries, the work that went into 'Life' was notable and unmistakably rare footage was provided.
0446569895|5.0|Sure I've seen the episodes of VH1's Behind the Music .. but, little did I know all those stories and rumors were true. I'm still amazed by the fact that Ozzy is still alive with all the drug and alcohol abuse. His wife Sharron is a saint for putting up with his behavior.  It's a very interesting read and it's told through Ozzy's view. Obviously he never took pen to paper .. but, it's really well done.  Maybe one day I'll meet the madman himself .. now that would be something!<br /><br />Steve
6302470021|4.0|Since Casino Royale was not definitely going to be a real James Bond movie, and the makers understood that, they evidently decided to compensate by having so many Bonds in the movie that they made up for it. LOL If you watch this dieing to see a Bond movie, you'll of course be utterly disappointed.<br /><br />If you watch it with the expectation of seeing a 60s zany-style comedy, it delivers in spades.<br /><br />The theme song is just too cool. Herb Alpert at his best.<br /><br />And for a 60s flick, its pretty sexy as well.<br /><br />\\"Have no fear ... Bond is here\\".
B003JYOFIW|4.0|The music on here is as good as anything they've ever done. A great comeback from a legendary band. The only qualm I have is the cover art, which is incredibly dumb and flies in the face of Devo's usual embracement of all things dada. It's a shameful attention grab, but a minor complaint, as the material on the album makes no apologies. 4 1/2 stars.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|If the James Bond franchise had to be rebooted, this was the way to do it.<br /><br />Daniel Craig gives the character a sense of deadliness not sensed since the Timothy Dalton days. As much as I liked Connery, Moore, and Brosnan, and all delivered good performances, none of them seemed like sudden death with a bad attitude. For a government assassin, such an attitude would be helpful.<br /><br />Daniel Craig sells that attitude convincingly. From the very start where he coolly terminates a traitor, to the very end where shoots a foe through the leg when it is clear he didn't have to, you know this Bond is cool about the job of dealing death.<br /><br />The movie itself? I think of it as three movies in one. It starts as an action flick, segues into a cool spy mode with a very relaxed and long lasting poker tournament, and then gets back to the action again.<br /><br />Although this movie does have scenes that remind you of the book, it is not a close cover of the book in the way the first few Connery movies were.<br /><br />Altogether quite enjoyable, and closer to the way I perceived Bond as I read the books than most of the other Bond actors managed.<br /><br />The DVD presentation meets current standards well. The picture is bright and sharp, and the sound quality is outstanding. If you liked this film in the theater, you won't be disappointed with the DVD.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm pretty much an addict when it comes to at home workouts and workout DVDS, so it was only a matter of time until I came across a Jillian Michaels workout.  Although I only use it when I'm short on time, I have to say this is the best quickie workout on the market.  I've always found Jilllian Michael's no-nonsense approach a bit intimidating on the Biggest Loser, but it comes into handy with this DVD.  I've come to learn over the years as a workout video junkie that silly, over-the-top instructors are only amusing in the beginning, than get annoying really fast and can make staying consistent with the program tedious and lackluster.  Jillian has yet to bore me, and breaks up her DVD into 3 levels.  Although I consider myself in good shape and have done the likes of P90x and Insanity, I still find that even level 1 is a good challenge.  For anyone who thinks it is too easy, just add heavier weights to really make the workout effective.  Jillian is a big believer in the 3-2-1 method, which entail 3 minutes of strength training, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs.  Not only has this type of interval training been proven extremely effective, but it makes the time fly fast as you are constantly changing up the exercises.  I have to admire Jillian Michaels for creating something that can help people just starting to exercise as well and for exercise afficionados looking to try something new.  I'll likely give her other DVDs a try if they are on sale as she has already won me over as fan.
1423113381|4.0|I was slightly apprehensive going into reading this book, as I so wanted it to be as good as the Olympians series, which are among my favorite YA books. Happily, I was not disappointed. There are a lot of similarities between this book and the Percy series (connection to gods, humorous situations, lots of action), which reminded me why I love Riordan's writing style and plotting. However, there was enough in this book that was different that I didn't feel I was reading a rehash of a previous work. Carter and Sadie are witty, feisty, and interesting, yet still maintain believability as twelve year old characters (as believable as twelve year olds can be while mingling with ancient Egyptian gods). I am not as familiar with Egyptian mythology as I am Greek, so I really had to pay attention to the backgorund info in this one. But this was not a hindrance to my enjoyment of the book.    As with the Olympians series, the chapter titles are hilarious. I think it a fortuitous sign when I am already laughing at the table of contents. And I loved the brief reference to the gods of Olympus. Looking forward to the next book in the Kane chronicles series (and pretty much anything else Riordan writes).
B003A4IFGY|4.0|Mojo marks a bit of a direction change for Tom Petty and his Heartbreakers.  As noted in coverage of the new album, there's more of an overt blues emphasis on Mojo, and Tom encouraged his bandmates to play \\"looser\\" for these recordings, aiming for more of a \\"live in the studio\\" kind of feel.  The result is a collection of 15 new tunes that sound a bit more rootsy and raw than your average Petty record.  Still, this is not any kind of MAJOR departure.  The group's sound is still anchored in a place that will be familiar to longtime fans.<br /><br />Regarding the blues element, it is most evident on a Zep-ish cut such as \\"I Should Have Known It,\\" and there are several songs that are direct homages to blues masters, especially the opening \\"Jefferson Jericho Blues\\" and \\"Lover's Touch.\\"  But even the less obviously influenced songs have a blues spirit shot through the notes.  That doesn't mean there aren't accessible rock songs on Mojo.  Far from it -- \\"Running Man's Bible,\\" \\"Candy\\" and several others are good old rock 'n' roll numbers that will undoubtedly be concert favorites this summer and into the future.  As far as the band's playing on the album, interviews with Tom had him describing how he pushed Mike Campbell in particular to overcome his usual reluctance for performing flashy guitar solos and let it air out for a change.  We get to hear the results early on, with a zesty Campbell electric guitar solo on the 2nd cut, \\"First Flash of Freedom.\\"<br /><br />This is a great album to listen to, but it doesn't quite have that flow of one amazing song after another that TP/HB masterpieces like Torpedoes or Hard Promises did.  Still, it has many fabulous individual tracks, and I'm sure I'll be returning to Mojo often!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Incredible movie and  all my family and friends have sat and watched in awe and disbelief.  Thank goodness someone made a real life movie that tells it like it is, much of what I already knew and was aware of.    Everyone in America should see this movie and it should be a prerequisite in schools.
0446563048|5.0|We're living in a wonderful period. Not only Internet opened up a lot of opportunities for people to create and grow businesses in a matter of years or, sometimes, months, where previously it took decades, but also these people are able to share their experience, their knowledge and their thoughts and make it quick, in few years after their success, not as memoires 40 years after. This book is one of those treasures.<br /><br />Inspiring story, inspiring life and a lot of things to learn.<br /><br />Must read of the year!

Has anyone figured out what   percentage of the film is  dedicated to showing various  groups of men on the bridge  in stormy weather having  enormous amounts of water  sprayed and splashed on them?  The figure is way to high.    The things that happen are  pretty standard submarine  adventure movie stuff.  - Oh no, we are too deep,  will the submarine be crushed.  - Oh no, there is   a cheap plastic model Destroyer  headed straight for us.    Why go on?    The ending was good,  but hardly worth the investment  of nearly 3.5 hours.    This was a television  mini-series put together  and edited onto a single  DVD as one continuous story.  Perhaps that accounts   for the weaknesses,  but they are weaknesses  nonetheless.  Perhaps the shorter 149 min.  cut is better, although   I have no desire to find out.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Great Video good sound and bonus CD.  on a 1 to 10 its a solid 9
B00005K9LN|5.0|Come on, who hasn't heard of British Steel and who doesn't love it?<br /><br />If you're a metal fan, the odds are you've heard all the songs on this CD and you love them all. I don't think there's something I should say to convince you to buy this CD, I just think this kind of quality music sells itself. I bought it and I would buy it every week if someone were to steal it from me weekly. (or maybe I would have that person tortured and killed - kidding)<br /><br />What's more to say about this work of art? Best album of the best heavy metal band! Buy it, listen to it, love it, worship it. As of now, it is your new shrine. LOL
B002S0OBMS|2.0|Before I invested in a ticket to see this show I decided to buy the OCR. Not much to write home about. Few tunes as melodious as Phantom. One reprise.  Ironic that while they include an insert to get LND ringtones (high tech) the album does not display track titles on a CD player  (low tech). Somewhat of a repeat of the fiasco from the original Phantom CD discs which included only one track per disc.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|I bought this album just after it was released, in 2008. Actually, i pre-ordered it so I could listen to it before the international tour kicked off.<br /><br />I like this album very much, it's very much different from the other Priest albums. I've been a Priest fan for... well, ever since I heard the first Judas Priest song. I love all their albums, from Screaming for Vengeance (I can't really say I love Rocka Rolla, although Never Satisfied is pretty nice) and to Angel of Retribution and Nostradamus. This is a conceptual album, as you might have seen on this site or on others, which means that all the songs are linked through their subject and through their sound (most songs start the way the previous ended). Other than the fact that this is Judas Priest's first conceptual album (and maybe the only one, who knows?), it is very very special due to the packaging. It's superb, vintage-like packaging is worth all they ask for and much, much more.<br /><br />The 2 CDs come in a book. The first CD is inserted near the beginning of the book and the second is near the end. The book has a lot of cool pictures and it also has a description of the album and Nostradamus' life and also has the lyrics for each song(which was to be expected). Everything just looks very nice and very well thought. The only regret I have is that I haven't reviewed this item earlier, maybe I would have helped users make up their mind faster.<br /><br />Overall, it's a must buy! Whether you're a Judas Priest fanatic or simply a metal fan, you must have this in your library. Period!
B000F6IINK|5.0|Handful of Soul was recorded in 2006, but it still stands out as one of the best \\"smooth jazz\\" vocal recordings in years.  Biondi's voice is beautiful, expressive and soulful as it rides and weaves through excellent arrangements and tight instrumental performances - intelligently augmented by a great mix.  Although different in their tone and phrasing, the level of Biondi's performance on this CD reminds me of some of my favorite classic Johnny Hartman recordings.  (I never thought I'd say something like that, but Handful of Soul is just that good.) Handful of Soul is only available at this time at an import price, but it is still well worth the extra few dollars.    Surprisingly, Biondi's later CD, \\"If,\\" seems to stray a bit too far out of his element; his efforts on \\"If\\" to achieve a \\"pop\\" sound make him sound like a less-than-successful David Clayton-Thomas imitator - but Handful of Soul showcases Biondi at his very best, and when he is at his best, there is no one better. My recommendation is to buy this CD, skip the follow-up, If, and wait for Biondi's next effort.
0525423842|3.0|I'm a fan of John Grisham's writing, but his most recent novels have been less than satisfying.  I think this is largely due to the lack of well-developed storylines.  Grisham often plays with interesting ideas, but he never seems to take the time to flesh them out to their full potential.  I read once that it only takes Grisham four months to write a novel, and it shows in the results.  Many of his novels read like well-written first drafts - they're entertaining enough to finish, but are ultimately unsatisfying.<br /><br />THEODORE BOONE: KID LAWYER is Grisham's attempt to write a young adult novel, and it's a decent effort.  The main character and his family are quite likable.  13-year old Boone wants to be a lawyer when he grows up, and often dispenses legal advice to his friends.  It's clear that Grisham is using this book as a device to teach kids about the American legal system.  Throughout the story, Boone delivers a variety of lectures on criminal, family, and foreclosure law.  This sounds boring, but Grisham actually does a solid job of making this material seem relevant and interesting.<br /><br />While I found this novel enjoyable, its main plotline - which involves a murder trial - is lackluster.  This book contains very little action or suspense, and the ending lacks any sense of closure.  In the end, THEODORE BOONE: KID LAWYER doesn't come close to the very best of YA, like the Harry Potter books or Susanne Collins' THE HUNGER GAMES.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give this novel a mild recommendation.  If you're looking for a YA novel with some educational content, this is a decent choice.  But overall I found this book to be another one of Grisham's minor efforts.
B003FMTZOM|2.0|As \\"Bionic,\\" Christina Aguilera's first release in four years, comes to a close with the song \\"Vanity,\\" Christina proudly asks \\"Let us not forget, who owns the throne?\\" with her presumably son chiming in \\"You do mommy.\\" But after listening to the album in its entirety one is only left to wonder, \\"Now which throne exactly are you talking about Christina?\\"<br /><br />It's quite difficult to describe the complete enormity of this disaster. But as the album opens with the title track, Christina proclaims that her moniker is \\"Xtina\\" again, from the Stripped days, which she hauls back and recycles for a reason that is in all honesty anybody's guess. Venturing backwards is never a good sign for any artist, as it screams \\"I'm completely out of ideas.\\" \\"Not Myself Tonight\\" is marginally good at best, but could have been much, much better, with which almost any listener could agree. The juvenile \\"WooHoo\\" is perhaps one of the most oddly placed songs on the album, as its crass reference to oral sex again sounds like it was a track that never made it onto the final cut of Stripped. \\"Elastic Love\\" sounds cool and is catchy for the first thirty seconds or so, but Chrsitina's voice quickly becomes trapped within the song's auto-tuned collapsing beat. \\"Desnudate\\" is mediocre at best and sounds rather dated. \\"Glam\\" is plain old embarrassing as Aguilera blatantly attempts to recreate Madonna's timeless \\"Vogue\\" for a remake of sorts twenty years later, which ends up becoming a complete miss.<br /><br />\\"Prima Donna\\" is one of the better songs on the album as its catchy nature is perfectly paired with Christina's signature vocals. \\"Sex for Breakfast\\" is a sheer hot mess, as she manages to hook you into the song with its sensual R&B groove for about the first minute and a half, before it becomes hysterical, whether intentionally or not. Christina sings about sex as though she is reading from a phone book. Again, it may have been accepted to a degree on Stripped, but as the singer nears 30, its lack of substance is rather frightening. What follows \\"Sex for Breakfast\\" are the requisite Christina ballads, starting with the Linda Perry penned \\"Lift Me Up.\\" The track beautifully showcases her voice, but with paper thin lyrics that are awfully reminiscent of \\"Beautiful,\\" it seems to be on Bionic for purely contrived reasons - and Linda Perry is so 2005 anyway.<br /><br />After the ballads have dragged on to their conclusion, the album picks up again with \\"I Hate Boys,\\" one of the more fun cuts to make its way onto Bionic. Although it sounds like a high school behind-the-bleachers chant in the vein of Gwen Stefani, it is worth the two minutes and twenty seconds it occupies on the album. \\"My Girls\\" is fun and perhaps the most believable song on Bionic featuring a rap by singer Peaches, yet with the vast majority of the other songs on the album, it does not take away an ounce of the album's complete lack of cohesiveness. After the album concludes with \\"Vanity,\\" it is quite easy to realize that Christina's absence on the music scene in the last four years has produced quite a few other pop divas who Xtina tries to desperately catch up to and surpass all in the same felt swoop, yet fails horribly.<br /><br />The saving grace of it all is her beautiful voice which, when given the chance in between the overly thumping beats, sounds as beautiful as ever. As she throws as much garbage as possible against the wall with a slew of producers and hopes something sticks, her stellar voice is lost in the thick of it all. This is a shame, as it represents what \\"Bionic\\" truly is - Christina getting lost in a transparent thigh-high corn maze which ends up becoming a rare misstep in the singer's career.f substance is rather frightening.

B001HN69AY|5.0|This was a very weird but good movie. I love it. But not for people who don't like to see a movie more than once. But if you don't care be ready to watch it more than once. It has very good performances by Heath Ledger, Christopher Plummer and especially Tom Waits loved every minute of it. Very Good buy if you like Terry Gilliam.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|I know I am in the minority when I say I am not a Springsteen fan. I like a few things he has recorded over the years, but his voice always left me pretty cold.<br />I finally listened to \\"Magic\\" today - Bruce has never sounded better. Yes, production values leave something to be desired, but I could not ask more from him - I rated 4 stars. Would have been a 5+ with a better production. I agree - remaster it
B0030U1TLQ|2.0|It always grates on me when all a person has to do is see the word \\"remastered\\" and they immediately spew out the blind praise that it \\"sounds amazing\\". In most cases, that's a very incorrect statement. The two recent Duran Duran reissues are some of the worst I've heard, (and notice the difference between reviews of those CD's on Amazon's UK site compared to here). \\"Disintegration\\" is no exception in the world of bad remasters.    On the plus side, the CD had not been brickwalled and compressed to the point that the dynamics are squashed out. However, it's the re-equalizing that's been done that destroyed it for me. The bass has been WAY too enhanced. My headphones were distorting and thumping, and I've never heard these powerful headphone respond this way. \\"Plainsong\\" also displays very obvious distortion during the crashing sounds if you view the wave file in a program that displays a spectral view. After I listened to three songs from this lousy \\"remaster\\", I sold it on eBay and will stick to the original CD I purchased 21 years ago.    So all of you can praise this release for the supposed improved sound, but as a long time audiophile I can tell you that this CD had not been improved..., unless you consider distorted bass and increased volume an improvement.
0439023491|5.0|Written with the same amount of intensity, excitement, and drive, this highly-anticipated sequel to The Hunger Games does not disappoint.<br /><br />:Spoiler ONLY if you have NOT read the first book::<br /><br />Synopsis: It picks right where it left off in the first book in this young adult trilogy. Katniss won the games, but so did Peeta. Now they are back in the city of Panem, and the government (fondly called the Capitol) is furious as to how both of them tricked them into letting two contestants win. This results in a plan of twisted vengeance that could change not only their lives, but the future of the whole city.<br /><br />Review: This sequel has everything the first book has, so if you liked that one, you would like this too. Truthfully, a part of me actually thought this was better than its predecessor, which is a rarity when it comes to follow-ups.<br />In Catching Fire, we learn more about the main characters, as well as the Capitol, which I thought was really interesting and intriguing.<br /><br />Overall, I think this was used mainly as a follow-up, adding in much needed information that the first book lacked, and as a perfect transition for its conclusion in the final book. A very good one at that. Fans will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Note: Final book will be out on Aug2010.

0385504225|1.0|Warning: This review has a tendency to come off as a biased rant.<br /><br />I'll begin by saying I am a huge fan of Dan Brown and his previous novels. I am so much of a fan that I bought this on its release day, pre-ordered and all. So no, I'm not just hating. If you just want to know what I think about the novel, I'll get to the point; I did not like it.<br /><br />If you are still interested though, I would like to share how I imagined Dan Brown's notes for this book to be like. I'm pretty sure it will look something like this...<br /><br />HOW TO WRITE MY NEXT #1 INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER:<br /><br />1. Start with a renowned expert dying a hideous and morbid death. *next chapter* The phone rings in the middle of the night, waking up our main character, informing him about sudden, shocking, unexpected events that just happened. Our protagonist would then need to take an unexpected flight to nowhere. Once destination is reached, he will then have to face hours of grueling mystery and dangerous adventures, uncover historic secrets, and solve the problem hand in hand with a bunch of random other characters...... or else.<br /><br />2. DESCRIBE DESCRIBE DESCRIBE. (in full detail)<br /><br />- talk endlessly about main character's brooding looks, clothing (turtleneck, Harris Tweed jacket, khakis, and collegiate cordovan loafers), six pack swimmer and water polo abs, and Mickey Mouse watch. (also: talk nonstop about how the other characters' use their iPhones and Blackberry&lt;- very important!)<br /><br />3. Have different variations of these:<br /><br />Character 1: A lot of people don't know but `X' can be seen throughout history.. even famous landmarks and monuments.<br /><br />Character 2: I don't understand what you mean...<br /><br />Character 1 shows Character 2. For a moment there, Character 2 could not grasp what Character 1 meant. And then all of a sudden... *GASP* it dawned on him.<br /><br />4. Talk about Christianity/God/Jesus/Catholicism/Buddhism/Muslim/ancient groups/secret orders/secret cults/science/The Bible, etc.<br /><br />5. Add a beautiful, wealthy, sexy, smart scientist (aka love interest. gender: female) who has ground-breaking secret inventions, research, and experiments that could forever change the course of history!<br /><br />6. Add a villain. Tall, freakish looking, psychotic, bald, and rich. (come up with smarter adjectives ASAP)<br /><br />7. The Ending. Something big. Something crazy. Something drastic. Add a twist. Something inspiring. Anything jaw-dropping.<br /><br />8. One last thing. Add cliffhangers in EVERY chapter. And then make the readers wait for the revelations. They don't have to make sense. They don't have to advance the plot, or count for anything.They just have to be shocking!<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTES: 1.)Write about 500 pages to satisfy my editor's requirements. 2.)

B0036EBARO|5.0|I absolutely love this album. I was disappointed with their last effort. Since I'm a big fan of 80's new wave, I guess my opinion is a little subjective, but oh well, it's still a wonderful album. All the tracks are great. The song \\"I Wanna Life\\" draws from the 80's song Gloria by Laura Branigan. I wouldn't call it a cover, but it does have the same melody and beat as the original song Gloria, and it also takes from the song \\"Too Much, Too Little, Too Late\\" by Johnny Mathis and Deneice Williams. If you've never heard those songs, give them a listen and you'll hear the influence in Goldfrapp's version. I'd have to say this is my favorite album right next to Black Cherry.
0307454541|3.0|For this review, I am not going to be writing my own synopsis.<br /><br />Synopsis: Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch--and there's always a catch--is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. - Dave Callanan<br /><br />Review: I was literally just staring at my computer screen, trying to come up with my own summary for this novel, but obviously had a hard time, and eventually failed to do so. I don't know if it's because the plot is too complicated to tell without giving away too much information, or if I wasn't just into it that much. I guess it's a bit of both.<br /><br />This is an international bestseller, and I see this everywhere I go! (bookstores, Target, Walmart, etc) I guess, in a lot of ways, I can see how this has gained so much popularity and praise.<br />Generally, the book is good.<br /><br />But.. not that good.<br /><br />It is less than expected, especially after hearing many people recommending this book and reading its good reviews. I have to agree though, it is interesting. It also is really rich in intricate details. But like I said already, it just wasn't that good.<br />The novel is long, and it felt like it! It took a while for it to get to the main plot, that by the time it did, I couldn't even tell because of all the other unnecessary subplots. The middle part of the book was the best part, but the ending, like I said about how it started, was also drawn out way too much. The characters also, were not developed well enough, which made it hard for me to connect or relate more to them. Their roles were not believable either. And when I don't care that much for the characters, I tend to not care much about what's going on, what's happening to them, and the situations they are facing.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the author's intelligent writing, I don't know what would have made me kept reading.<br />Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad book. Overall, I guess I would still recommend it, so you can judge it for yourself. It's just that I can think of a lot of other titles similar to this plot and style that would be much better choices than this.when I don't care that much for the characters, I tend to not care much about what's going on, what's happening to them, and the situations they are facing.

Soon enough, she learns to read more and more. But these are dangerous times for Liesel and her foster family, especially when they hide a Jew in their basement. Everything is unexpected and everyone is fearful. As Liesel becomes a full-pledged book thief, during these times, \\"her world is both opened up and closed down.\\"<br /><br />Review: Prior to reading this, I have already heard a lot of great things about this book from different sources; reviews, bookstores, blogs, friends, etc. I must say, it definitely lived up to its hype, and exceeded expectations.<br /><br />This was just such a wonderfully written novel from a very skilled author, who I think, crafted just one of the most unforgettable stories I've read in a while. I have read several stories centered during the Holocaust, but this is my favorite, without a doubt.<br /><br />As heartbreaking as this book generally was, I don't think it would have had the same impact that it had if it was done differently. The message that came along with it, was subtle but strong. It was heart wrenching, but also strangely uplifting at the same time. It made me not only think, but really feel and empathize with these characters I've grown to love and feel attached to. Even after I read the entire thing, and off reading another novel, I would find myself still thinking about the characters and their stories. And it's not that often that we get to find characters like that in books, most especially in fiction, that leave marks or imprints like that in our heads.<br /><br />The Book Thief is just everything a good book should be; original, engaging, inspiring, uplifting, and haunting all at the same time. With wonderful writing, unique narratives, memorable quotes, and the most lovable and unforgettable characters, one thing's for sure, this book is nothing less than amazing. I loved it, and I think that you will love it too.<br />Posted by Jillian at 4:41 PMook is nothing less than amazing. I loved it, and I think that you will love it too.  Posted by Jillian at 4:41 PM
B00030DEQE|4.0|I ordered this item after a lightning storm disabled the built-in ethernet port on my PC (and fried my old wireless router). It arrived fast from the Amazon seller but there was nothing in the box except the card. As an Intel product I expected a CD-ROM and instructions. I installed the card and the PC P&P found the new hardware but no driver. So I went to the Intel web site and after a bit of searching found the driver download file and finally the PC could install it. Unfortunately, it worked only intermittently for me, the PC kept saying it was unplugged, so after the new wireless router arrived I set up the wireless adapter which works more reliably - and no cable for lightning to affect.
030745455X|5.0|This is a sequel to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. And again, for this review, I will not be writing my own synopsis.<br /><br />Synopsis: Lisbeth Salander is a wanted woman. Two Millennium journalists about to expose the truth about the sex trade in Sweden are brutally murdered, and Salander's prints are on the weapon. Her history of unpredictable and vengeful behaviour makes her an official danger to society - but no-one can find her anywhere. Meanwhile, Mikael Blomkvist, editor-in-chief of Millennium, will not believe what he hears on the news. Knowing Salander to be fierce when fearful, he is desperate to get to her before she is cornered and alone. As he fits the pieces of the puzzle together, he comes up against some hardened criminals, including the chainsaw-wielding 'blond giant' - a fearsomely huge thug who can feel no pain. Digging deeper, Blomkvist also unearths some heart-wrenching facts about Salander's past life. Committed to psychiatric care aged 12, declared legally incompetent at 18, this is a messed-up young woman who is the product of an unjust and corrupt system. Yet Lisbeth is more avenging angel than helpless victim - descending on those that have hurt her with a righteous anger terrifying in its intensity and truly wonderful in its outcome. - Source<br /><br />Review: If you have read my review for its predecessor, you would know I wasn't exactly raving too much about it. But I'm happy to say that this sequel turned out much better than that.<br />One of my main complaints with the first one was that the characters were not well developed enough. Here, we get to learn more about them, which I liked a lot. Also, I don't know if I've ever mentioned this before, but Larsson really paints a strong woman in one of his main characters, which I highly respect. I like an author--especially one from the opposite sex--that can see see women as they are, and not be afraid to depict them as that in their stories.<br />Another good thing about this is the pace. It no longer seemed to draw out with unnecessary subplots, but went straight to the point instead. It was much faster to read as well, and much more exciting. There were many plot twists, but none of them seemed forced.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book.

0061777250|5.0|Highly recommended.  And the production information posted on Amazon is accurate.  ----- Here is another excellent entry in the growing literature of doctors writing on the near death experience and arguing for its credibility. -----  Pim Van Lommel writes beautifully and eloquently, drawing on an abundance of  materials with clarity and persuasion.  His observations and conclusions are well worth reading for anyone fascinated by the growing body of evidence that consciousness transcends the physical.  Chapter Ten of the book contains \\"A Comprehensive NDE: (by) Monique Hennequin\\" and is one of the most moving NDE accounts I've ever read.  ---- This book is comprehensive enough to be your first book on the subject, and significant enough to be your latest.  ---- There is no doubt in my mind that NDE research is some of the most important research of our time.  I'm grateful to Pim Van Lommel for this substantive contribution to the field.
0061537969|5.0|I'm one of those people that picked this book up simply because it had a cute looking picture of a dog. When I read the synopsis and found out it actually was about the dog in the picture, I was sold.<br /><br />(really short and simple) Synopsis: Enzo is a dog. On the eve of his death, he tells the story of his human companions and the bond that he has and shares with them.<br /><br />Review: This is one of the best I've read in 2009. It's such a unique thing to do to write a novel from the perspective of a dog. I liked it a lot! It was gut-wrenching, philosophical, funny, sad, and sweet all at the same time. But the best thing about it is how honest it is, talking about the similarities (and differences) between canines and humans. Add in the author's amazing job of making the situations and characters very realistic and also relat-able. And no, I don't think you need to be a dog lover exactly to love this book. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good novel to read
B000MR9D5E|4.0|This is an extremely informative DVD with a lot of content that both adults and kids will enjoy. The photography and quality of the shots are absolute treat to watch, especially if you have a Hi-Def TV. The only thing that I would consider is the repeat watchability of these DVDs - this is a like a great documentary movie, but am not sure how many times I'll watch this unless I'm showing it to other friends and family. I would first consider renting this from a store or online and if you like it a lot, then go about purchasing it.
0312243022|4.0|Synopsis: Virginia Woolf is living in London in 1923, and is beginning to write and work on the now-famous, Mrs. Dalloway. Concurrently, a woman in Los Angeles in 1949, finds herself unhappy after three years of marriage with her husband. Despite this, she is trying her best to be a good wife and a soon-to-be-mother. One day, she picks up Woolf's novel, and begins to read. In it, she finds herself getting lost, as she sees the parallels and similarities between her life and the story. Meanwhile, in present time, there is 52-year-old, Clarissa Vaughan, a self-proclaimed modern version of \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" She is preparing a party dedicated to her former lover -- a poet -- who is now dying of AIDS.<br />This book surrounds three completely different women, leading very different lives and having their own different stories. In the end, they find that their lives are touched and interwoven together across time, by one powerful and important novel.<br /><br />Review: First of all, this, no doubt, has an intriguing premise and offers a unique perspective on things.<br />With clarity and sincerity, the author makes a genuine take on common people, like us, and their ordinary lives, through multifaceted characters. It is really not at all difficult to relate to them, not exactly because of their situations, but mainly for the emotions that they feel and the thoughts that they ponder on. I realize that, everybody feels and thinks about these things. Some, more often than others. And this book, simply, shows that sadness -- that depressing -- side of life, that everybody goes through at one point or another.<br />As for the writing, I thought that the author did a great job showcasing his talent and skill appropriately, by perfecting the book's pace and flow. Also, he made it all work through his poetic but effortless wordplay. It was simple and easy to grasp, but on-point and complex. It also just had the right amount of drama and emotion, without getting too corny, sappy, or cliche.<br />I have to admit though, there were a few negative things about the novel. There were few, but they're there nonetheless. I found that at times, it was difficult to figure out who's narrating. The speaker changes constantly, and their voices are not as distinct the way their personalities are, in my opinion.<br />Also, I have heard a lot from people (friends, family, other reviews) that they did not enjoy this one. One reason is probably because of its dark and \\"depressive\\" mood and atmosphere. Also, another possible reason, would be that at times, there were a few lengthy, and even unnecessary, descriptions every now and then. Some people don't mind the long descriptions, others do.<br />Despite this, I still do recommend it. I also would give it 4 stars -- definitely an entertaining and emotional read, but not \\"You-have-to-read-this-now!\\" sort of great. It is more of a \\"Add-this-to-your-TBR-if-you'd-like\\" kind of good. I guess though, in a way, this is just one of those books that you either like or you don't. Personally, I liked it.admit though, there were a few negative things about the novel. There were few, but they're there nonetheless.

0312370849|3.0|Synopsis: In this novel, the author brings a fiction story based on the 1942 Paris roundups and deportations, where Jewish families were arrested and transported to Auschwitz.<br />Julia Harmond, a forty-five-year-old writer for an American magazine, has been assigned by her editor to cover the coming 60th anniversay of the V&eacute;l' d'Hiv' roundups. While doing this assignment, she learns that the apartment she is planning to move into with her husband was once the house of a Jewish family that were part of the deportation 60 years ago. The more she learns about the family, especially about the 10-year-old daughter, Sarah, who was the only one who survived, the more she learns about her husband and his family's background, France, and ultimately, herself.<br /><br />Review: In this book, the author used an effective method of alternating the past (1942) with the present.The historical plot and storyline makes this compelling, interesting, and intriguing. But even though there were good points, I don't think it was that good overall.<br /><br />It started to lose its appeal by the middle of the book, that it lost me with it as well. There were unnecessary ramblings, and random events that might have been better if they were taken out or edited better. The modern life overshadows the tragedy of the past, making it seem like a book full of rants and complains of a not-so-likable character, suffering from mid-life crisis. (Sorry)<br /><br />In short, the story had great potential. The writing was good, but nothing special. The issues were not used and dealt with efficiently.<br />I just feel that if only it was handled differently by another author, it would have ultimately be a better book. Don't get me wrong, it is not a HORRIBLE book, but it is not GREAT either. Also, I can think of so many other different titles dealing with this storyline and issues that you will find so much better. This one is not so worth it. Personally, if I were you, I'd skip it.

0439023483|5.0|Synopsis: The Hunger Games is a game. A televised reality show for everyone to watch and see. A game where the government picks randomized names of two children from each of the twelve districts in the city of Panem.<br />The rules of the game are simple: kill everyone else or be killed. Only one survives.<br /><br />Review: Sometimes, the plot is only the beginning of a book. More often, it's the characters that hold up a story. With this young adult book, that's definitely the case.<br />Although done before, and the plot is not as original or unique, it's the main characters that truly kept me interested. They were very solid characters, likable, and believable. Because of that, it not only made me empathize and relate to them more, it also kept me hooked and interested.<br /><br />Another big plus for me was the writing and the pace. It never lagged, was simple, and straight-forward; nothing overly complicated or exaggerated. I liked that, because it showed that an author doesn't have to use big, fancy words all the time to create a point. Sometimes, even the simplest of words would suffice, if delivered the right way. I feel like this is one of those books that is the epitome of that idea.<br /><br />Also, I was really into the book the entire time I was reading it, and literally couldn't put it down. I know, it's a cliche to say that, but that is truly the case with this one. Even when I finished the book, I couldn't wait to check out the sequel. Unfortunately, (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), this is a popular trilogy so the library did not have it. I was also far too impatient to reserve it, because the number of holds were crazy! So I gave in and bought a copy of it instead. And I really do think it's worth buying. So yes, I do recommend this book. It's a young adult, fantasy/sci-fi/horror-ish novel, and though I usually tend to stay away from that genre, this one made me actually want to read others in that category.<br /><br />Again, like I said, I do recommend it. So read it, especially if you're in the mood for a really good, intriguing, interesting, well-written young adult book with a really disturbing storyline.especially if you're in the mood for a really good, intriguing, interesting, well-written young adult book with a really disturbing storyline.

142313494X|5.0|I think if you've noticed by now, I really was -- still am? -- a big Harry Potter nerd. I practically grew up with those books. So when the series ended, I started searching for others that would fill that tiny 'void' Harry Potter left. And after a bunch of unfulfilling series to another unfulfilling series, I started to lose hope. Lately though, I have been hearing so much positive reviews from friends and other book bloggers about The Lightning Thief. Finally, I gave in and decided to give it a try.<br />For this review, I will not give a full synopsis. You can find it here though if you'd like to check it out.<br /><br />Actual review: To put it simply; I loved this book.<br />I know this is mainly written for children, tweens, and maybe some YA, but I have to say, I recommend this to adults as well. In fact, this is the kind of book that will be appreciated by any age group. It just goes to show, that if the book's plot, characters, story line, and the writing are entertaining, interesting, and intriguing, there is no such thing as an age limit.<br />As I said, I thought that the story itself was simply entertaining, and actually has substance. I loved that it centers around Greek mythology as well -- definitely original. The main characters are also just so likable. They're believable, and very easy to relate to. As for the twists and turns, I feel as if they are done just right. Honestly, I can't think of any reason how anyone would dislike this book. Add to that the addicting writing that is of Rick Riordan's, and I don't know how anyone can resist this.<br />In my opinion actually, I believe this is the only successful and fulfilling fantasy series after Harry Potter. I loved the fact though, that The Lightning Thief is an entirely different series on its own. It does not try to be a copy cat, which I appreciate, as I can not tell you how many I have read that has tried to do so. I will not mention any names, but if you can think of any, leave a comment and it'll be our little secret. Haha.<br />Overall, I just really enjoyed this first offering of the 'Percy Jackson and the Olympians' series. In fact, right after I finished this, I went straight to Target -- where books are just cheaper -- and bought the second installment, The Sea of Monsters. I can't wait to finish that one as well, and head on to the third.. and the fourth.. and the last. If you have not read it yet, do so soon!<br /><br />Note: I haven't seen the movie, but will, as soon as the DVD comes out.et. Haha.

0061544493|4.0|Victoria Beckham is so fabulous and endearing. I like how her POV came across through this book. It's definitely a light summer/beach or lake read. Most of the tips are fairly common sense and I wish there were more pictures or her in certain styles to illustrate what she is referring to (also a vest is a tank top, which took me a while to figure out). I did enjoy it though and would read more of her books if she came out with more!
1423113381|5.0|Review: Being a huge fan of the Percy Jackson series, I just had to get my hands on this on the day of its release. I have to say, I'm incredibly happy I did so. I'm going to go straight to the point: I LOVED THIS BOOK and I highly recommend it to readers of all ages.<br /><br />Now that I got that crucial part out, it's up to you if you would like to continue reading this review. The truth is, I only have positive things to say about this addicting novel. The only negative thing I can think of is that this is just too incomplete -- it is torture that we have to wait for the next chapter of The Kane Chronicles to come out! Nevertheless, I'm here to explain exactly why I loved it so.<br />First off, there's no doubt about it; Rick Riordan can write. Once again, he does an awesome job combining mythology with the modern world. His wordplay is still as effective, most especially when he gives details, whether they're on the story's settings or on character descriptions. This allowed me to truly have a clear and vivid depiction of what's going on. Also, I appreciated the fact that there was just enough background information on Egyptian mythology, without it sounding like a boring lecture -- this is important, actually, as I certainly don't want to feel like I'm reading a textbook!<br /><br />The main thing that I loved about this though, are the main characters themselves; Carter and Sadie. I love them, because they seem so real -- I was able to empathize, root, and feel for them. I also liked that in the book, they both get to be narrators. I thought at first it wasn't going to work. Fortunately, it did. Having two completely different POVs let me get the entire picture, and get both sides instead of just one. You also really get how distinct the two of them are -- and their personalities -- through their voices. By the end of the book, I felt like I truly had a grasp of what this series is ultimately all about, and who the characters truly are. So overall, I loved this novel because it is well-written, exciting, believable, and is rich with complex and multifaceted characters. It is a series I will definitely be looking forward to.<br /><br />If you are to read this, try to take it for what it is, without high expectations, and you might enjoy it even more ;)<br />Please note also: try not to compare it to the Percy Jackson series, because this is really different, even though it is still about mythology. The characters and their voices are absolutely different. But okay, maybe some of you are still wondering: Was it better than the Percy Jackson series? Hmmm... the truth is, I think I'm just incredibly biased, because Percy Jackson and Greek mythology will always have a special place for me. However, I also can't deny how much I enjoyed and loved this one as well. You decide. For me, The Red Pyramid gets 5 stars.is well-written, exciting, believable, and is rich with complex and multifaceted characters. It is a series I will definitely be looking forward to.

B000TSIK14|1.0|I'm a long time Scorps fan, prefer the 70s Uli stuff but love all the 80s stuff, seen 'em live a dozen times and have my tix to see 'em this summer.  I'm afraid to buy the new CD because of just how bad Humanity Hour 1 was/is.  I listened to the whole thing 3 times just to make sure I wasn't missing something, but I had it right the first time.  It's just tedious to get through, my instinct was to change the station or click to the next track.  Got $3 for it at the used record store, save your money.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|I was lucky enough to win a MOJO listening party in my small town and got to play the CD for about 100 people in our Rock -n- Roll museum before the CD was released. We all agreed it was a departure from their \\"rock -n- roll\\" style but a great venture into the bluesy sound. \\"Don't Pull Me Over\\" has a Bob Marley/reggae vibe to it and one of those tunes that gets stuck in your head. The guitar riffs are fantastic and you can tell the band had a great time making this CD.         Also, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are so loyal to their fans. It was such an honor to have their CD a week before it's release date and be able to share it with all the other fans in the area. You Rock Tom!
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Few shows capture the awkwardness of high school, and not just high school in the nineties.  Anyone who liked the show even remotely should buy this and relive the snark that is Daria.  I think she invented snark.    The bad: Oh MTV, after so long, this packaging is the best you can do?  There's no episode guide.  Every other TV series out there has a freaking episode list in the DVD release.  \\"Daria\\" doesn't even have a list of episode titles.   For fifty bucks, the production company could have done better.  It's just a plain multi-disc case with 6 discs and a letter of \\"get over it\\" regarding the absence of the pop music that was in the original aired versions.      The incidental music is fine, if a little subtle in places. There were only two places I thought where the lack of the original pop soundtrack was a problem.  In one place the lack of it ruined a joke about REM's \\"Everybody Hurts\\" video, which didn't make sense without the song playing. In the other, the incidental music should have been louder and the quiet didn't work for the scene.  That's it.   Only those of us who remember the original music will miss it, and if we wait long enough, age will take its toll and we'll forget about it.
B0002V7O3S|3.0|I looked forward to seeing this movie. Whether or not you believe Walton it is still a good story. The only mystery is why the producers worked hard to reproduce the story as told, but then totally re-wrote what happened in the abduction? It is nothing like what Walton claims to have happened.Look for Walton himself in a cameo in the \\"town hall meeting\\" scene.
B003A4IFDW|2.0|Betty LaVette must be a vampire because she's sucked the life's blood out of all of the songs that she covered on this album.  It really is a stellar line-up of songs but unfortunately they all get this same slow blues treatment that quickly becomes tedious.  I'm all for different interpretations of classic rock songs; some of them can be quite good but this is really just lifeless.
1423101499|5.0|Note: Like all my other reviews for this series, I will not be writing my own synopsis. However, you can read more about it here.<br /><br />Review: I loved this fourth installment to bits! Why, you may ask? Well, I keep saying the same reasons for every PJandO -- there's a ring to it, yes? no? haha -- review I write that I probably sound like a broken record. But that's okay.<br /><br />Reasons:<br />1. Character and plot development is wonderful and effortless<br />2. Rick Riordan's writing is addicting!<br />3. Pace is perfect<br />4. Greek mythology is still very fun and makes everything extra interesting!<br />5. The characters are lovable, likable, relate-able, funny, and just plain awesome.<br />And for the 6th reason -- and this is very important to me, actually: Female characters are portrayed in the way that they should be. No stereotypes. No discrimination. No sexism. None of those!<br /><br />Now that I got that out, I'd like to say that it would probably be nice if I read the last installment already, but actually, I have not. I don't even have the copy yet. To tell you the truth, I'm a little bit reluctant to do so. It may sound stupid, but I really don't want this series to end! Because of this, I am trying to sneak in two other books and finish them. That way, I wouldn't have to read how this wonderful series finishes just yet.<br /><br />If you have not read it yet, pick it up soon please. Even if you end up not liking it, I feel as if the worst thing that could happen to you is that your brain will be filled with random stuff about Greek gods&creatures and you will find yourself in the mythology section of the bookstore, trying to learn some more. Ahem, my friends will point their fingers at me right about now. It may sound funny, but I'm actually not kidding about that last part.
B003HE2B6C|4.0|Listening to this album just makes you happy.  Many people will be hesitant to listen thinking, \\"Hanson? Are you kidding me? MmmBop? No way I'm not listening to that!\\"  Give it a chance!  It's really quite good.  Catchy happy songs that practically force you to get up and grab whoever is closest to you and dance with them, along with a few soulful moving numbers that will bring a lump to your throat.  Face it, Hanson is grown up-- they've been through a lot and this album demonstrates it.  It's worth a listen or two.... or five.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I only went to this film because my daughter wanted to see a movie, we've already seen Shrek IV and Toy Story 3 isn't out yet. I saw the original Karate Kid in the theater, but wasn't excited by it and can't remember it.    The new Karate Kid is gorgeous.    It's a great film about parenting, and the difficulty of rearing children with enough discipline, respect and self-respect to live up to their potential.    It's a great film about what living in China is really like. To me, it felt as if this film was at least as good at showing me Beijing as Slumdog Millionaire was at showing me Mumbai.    It's probably, very subtly, a film about the United States wrestling with China.    And it's a great, great Kung Fu movie. The people who choreographed the fight scenes are AMAZING. I generally hate watching most fight scenes filmed since Captain Kirk bashed a skull over someone's head back in the 1960s. I can't pay attention to most fight scenes well enough to have any idea what's happening.    When I was watching Karate Kid, I was riveted. Word-of-mouth had packed the 600-seat theater I was in completely full, and we were all reacting as if our kid (or, in the case of kids, their own brothers) were the ones fighting.    Sadly, many of the reviews seem to be posted by fans of the original Karate Kid who are angry at the filmmakers for daring to make a new version of the film.  For me, nothing in this film triggered any memories of the original Karate Kid. I think that it's a completely different film with the same basic plot that all kids' sports movies happen to have, not a true remake. I don't think there's any reason for fans of the original Karate Kid to hate this one.
1423113381|4.0|I was pleased with the book it flowed very nicely. I didn't know much about Egyptian mythology like I did Greek. I am learning but think I will do a little research so I don't feel as far behind for the next one. Keep up the good work!
B000V86OKG|5.0|This is a great show. Showtime out did themselves in putting this one on their line up. It is funny dramatic and a real adventure. The only likable serial killer in history!
B003CIG7AE|3.0|I liked, but didn't love, this album by Band of Horses. It has tastes of Fleet Foxes and the Shins, although with fewer hooks and less emotional immediacy (whatever that is- the songs just seemed to have less emotional impact to them). Definitely way better than most of the over-produced packaged \\"indie\\" crap being forced down listener's ears these days. (\\"indie\\" is the new \\"alternative\\", both words being rendered meaningless beyond some A&R/PR hack's high concept).
0446402389|4.0|This is another one of those books that I find myself having a hard time writing a proper synopsis for. But I will tell you the general idea of what Child 44 is about.<br /><br />It is a fiction story written by an incredibly talented and skilled writer, who has set his story in the 1950s, during the time of the Stalinist Soviet Union. He then mixes some aspects of the factual and real case of Soviet serial-killer, Andrei Chikatilo. With these haunting elements, comes a well-written historical thriller, \\"serial killer\\" type of a book.<br /><br />I liked this a lot! First off, I thought that the setting itself was very original. There are other novels set during this time period, but honestly, I can't think of any that was up to par with this one. The best thing about it, simply, is the writing. The flow of words made it also surprisingly easy, despite the heavy topics. And the way he writes his descriptions, details, setting, events, and his characters.. very vivid, believable. Honest and authentic.<br /><br />I won't go on about it more, all I can say is I really liked this book. It is also one of my top choices for 2009. And also, I would recommend this to anyone who loves to read, wants fresh literature, and to those who like historical fiction. Great book.
0446563048|5.0|I was fortunate enough to get an advance copy of this book to read and review.  Unfortunately, once I received it, my life got turned upside down and I was just recently able to read it and give this review.  Having looked back at my life over the past couple of months, I regret that I was not able to read it sooner.  What a great story of a person who isn't at all driven by money, but by the passion of creating something different.     I didn't really realize it until I was about half way through the book, but I am about the same age as Tony and went through college during the same time as he.  While my life and Tony's life went down completely different paths, I can say that his experiences were on par with mine.  From the dot com boom of the 90's and the stories of the Silicon Valley bazillionaires, to the whole dot com bust, this book brought me back to a time when I remember being on the side-lines, wishing it was me that came up with those ideas that wrote the true rags to riches stories of that era that seems so long ago.    Tony was able to apply a lot of his life lessons and philosophies to this book and his life in general that will really make me think twice before going to work, entering a business meeting, and even dealing with my family.  His analogy of how poker is like business, his RAVE experiences, etc., was a fresh new look on life that many people don't pay attention to these days.  Tony was able to ground himself and show that not all powerful CEO's are the money hungry people that the media makes them out to be.  Tony is driven by his passion and not by his desire to get a bigger paycheck.  It was this fresh look on his philosophy that kept me turning the pages!!!

B002VLNB1Q|5.0|never been a fan of John Mayer, never heard any of his songs before buying this album. i bought this album on a whim, because 1. i didnt have anything else to listen to, and 2. i watched him play Heartbreak Warfare on television and he made me late for class because i got sucked into the performance. i must say he did not disappoint at all. It's almost as if he's telling a story with the songs on the album. without an ounce of exaggeration i listened to the album everyday for 2 months straight. definitely glad i made the spontaneous decision to buy it.<br />only problem i have with it is i don't understand why he asked taylor swift to sing 2 lines in Half of my Heart. the song would've been great without her.<br />Edge of Desire is by far my favorite song on this album, it makes me tear everytime i listen to it because there's so much passion and feeling when he sings. i love John Mayer.
B001C09KD0|5.0|I loved this book. Actually, in the very beginning of the book, I wasn't quite sure. She begins the book by describing what she's going through with her husband and I just really was not getting into the book but was certainly going to give it a bit more time. Before I knew it, I didn't want to put the book down and when I did put it down I found myself reflecting on my own life and more often than not, I was coming to some new realization about myself. I have only read this book once, but I have absolutely no doubt that it will be a regular read for me and I'll probably learn more about myself every time I read it. So, I loved it, not only did I laugh and cry with the author, but I learned a lot about myself...I really did not expect that!
0452287022|4.0|This book is a fictionalized story of the woman in one of Vermeer's paintings; Girl with a Pearl Earring. It is considered one of the most well-known paintings of Vermeer, if not the most.<br /><br />The girl in the painting, according to the book, is 16-year-old maid, Griet. She then starts from just serving the family, cleaning the house, doing laundry, and other household chores to becoming Vermeer's assistant.<br /><br />As for every book I have read, I try to write down both the positive and negative things about it. And for this review, I'll start with the positives.<br /><br />I do like the way the author writes, especially her descriptions and attention to detail; they were just right and not over the top. This is true most especially when she describes the landscapes, clothes, and settings. It is almost as if you yourself are actually in that era in Delft, living the life of Griet. This is also true every time she talks about the different uses of the paints and colors. I found them very interesting. Generally, this read is not boring because she writes very well and the concept of the book is mysterious and new.<br /><br />As for the negatives, ::may contain spoilers:: I do have to say that the ending was too abrupt and sudden. There are many loose ends. I also did not like most of the characters except for Maria Thins and Vermeer. The rest of them are either intentionally annoying or unintentionally uninteresting. I did not even like Griet, the main protagonist, at times. Although she was incredibly interesting and alive in this book, her character was overall unconvincing. For me, it was not so believable that a maid that has been said could not speak, write, interpret that well, and has no educational background whatsoever, was able to assist a talented painter by giving such knowledgeable and effective input. Maybe if she just gave little but helpful advices and tips here and there, it would have been more believable. But she was actually giving very, very credible help. But then again, maybe it is just me.<br /><br />THE CONSENSUS: It was a good read; I liked it. But it's the type of book that I probably would not be so enthusiastic picking up and reading over again. It is a fresh take on a mysterious historical painting, mixed with Chevalier's intricate writing. However, if you don't like rushed endings with loose ends left, then this book is probably not for you.in, maybe it is just me.    THE CONSENSUS: It was a good read; I liked it.

B000001FHV|5.0|What happens when you give a lot of drugs to bored desert kids with technical skill oozing from their pores? Meat Puppets.    Much as I love Up On The Sun I'm going with Too High as their best album. It has their best track, the dead gorgeous \\"Shine\\". Kirk's phrasing is perfect on the tricky lyrics. How he's getting those sudden word logjams out so clearly in his drone-drawl is beyond me. The song also begs for a ripping live cover by an ace bluegrass band.    There's plenty else to like. The band let loose their inner ZZ Top (with better playing) on \\"Violet Eyes\\" and \\"Backwater\\", go full honky-tonk on \\"Comin' Down\\".    \\"Things\\" is a grunge 60s Moody Blues track from an alternate dimension I'd very much like to visit.   \\"Severed Goddess Hand\\" is the alternate dimension version of early REM. Not sure I want to visit that one. I like the track but we've got Robyn Hitchcock in ours.    \\"Evil Love\\"'s mix feels off to me; forced. Tasty bass and drum work is wasted on an overall bland.    Great album. A must buy.
030726999X|4.0|For those who had pre-ordered Hornet's Nest and turned to page one when it landed on the doorstep on June 6, what more is there to be done other than frowning and making a sandwich after 200+ Amazon reviews in a week? To purport critically to analyze in some way this third of the Millenium trilogy? A sensible review should probably say to start from the start to get the full feel of this extraordinary character and narrative worth weeks' of fun reading. Literary it is not. A reviewer had doubted that Larsson had actually completed this third volume. Certainly the plot is there, and very satisfyingly so, which is the main thing, and the cliched, so few there were, expressions could have been filled in by an algorithm, which is possibly what occurred. Absolutely enjoyable, thrilling and uplifting d&eacute;nouement. Larsson RIP.

B0036EH3WU|3.0|LOST  A peaceful breeze washes over paradise, sparkling sand against the ocean blue and a clear as glass sky. Suddenly, debris rains down from heaven, a worst nightmare, a plane crash, sailing with the fury of hell in the sky, exploding into the screen and bringing with it a series of characters, whose stories are about to entwine, and lead us on an adventure of hope and sacrifice and love and spirituality, and as all true things have: mystery.  It is no wonder that the show was an overnight success, the first season reigning in enormous critical acclaim, fan interpretation, speculation and praise. The problem, mainly, is the length of the show, and with it, the feeling of `filler.' Dialogue that's drawn out and unnecessary, story arcs that feel `made up as they go along' and irrelevant, instances where you sit there thinking `Well that's just stupid', too much spoon feeding the audience, and really, not enough intelligence for such an expansive premise. Investing so much time in a series, instead you could watch about sixty movies, read twenty novels etc. People started turning off in season two, and based on untangling threads (Walt springs to mind) I know why.   However, by the end, it all seems worth it, you've lived another life, met characters you never would have known, and like most great things, felt a peculiarity, a curiosity, about the wonder of life itself. I can say a lot of negative things about how the show ground along, knowing that it would have been a five star show, no question, if it was perhaps only three seasons with a tighter and more fluid script, but looking back at it as a finished piece of work, it did its job, it told its story, and, for my money, it ended 'pretty' well.  Three and a half stars.
0061703257|4.0|Summary: Shutter Island is a story set at an infamous hospital for the criminally insane. When a patient escapes the facility, investigators Teddy Daniels and his partner, Chuck Aule, are called in to the scene. Faced with confusing uncertainty and unanswered questions, they work their way to solve one of their most difficult cases to date.<br /><br />Review: If you have read Lehane's other book, The Mystic River, or watched the movie version starring Brad Pitt, and loved it as much as I did, I will tell you that Shutter Island is completely different from that one. Though the same in level of good writing, interesting plot, and unpredictable twists, they are completely different in style. Shutter Island is a psychological thriller. And a frightening one at that.<br /><br />The main plot and the characters are fully developed. The dialogues were also entertaining, never boring or dull. The twists in almost every chapter in the book just creates havoc in your mind. The clues are there, but you'll never see them. The ending... I have to say is one of the best unguessable endings I've read in a while.<br /><br />So if you want a fast read that is capable of possibly making your hairs stand or give you chills, then this is the one for you. I recommend it.

0393327345|5.0|I feel like this novel is really everything that is great about the movie and more, almost as if the movie is really just an introduction to the book to incite us into reading it. I think, even knowing some of the big surprises from the movie, they are just presented in a different way that they feel even more powerful in this version of the story.<br /><br />But stepping away from comparisons to the movie, this is an amazing novel. It is exciting, dirty, dark, and fun all at the same time. Palahnuik does a great job of really grabbing the reader's attention and really pulling them into the world he creates and guiding them around an absolutely great story. He does all this while giving the reader just enough detail to keep them engaged and an understanding of what is going on, but at the same time, keeps them in the dark about a lot of elements too. This is what enables him to create the real climax of the story. And even knowing that it is coming, this section of the novel is just amazingly told part of the story.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the description of Project Mayhem and how much detail that we get about it throughout the novel. And the narrative of the Fight Club scenes is also very well told. It is the perfect level of detail that we get a great feeling of being there and just how brutal it is while not getting hung up on it. Some may feel that some of the more brutal and gruesome descriptions in the novel take it a bit too far, but I think it really sets the tone for the novel and really characterizes our protagonist.<br /><br />All in all, this turns out to be a very different story then the movie, and in my opinion a better one. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the movie, and to anyone who has not seen the movie, to pick this up and give it a shot before watching the movie.

B002HREKCI|5.0|Synopsis: Clay Jensen recieves a package on his front porch. But the odd thing was that there was no return address. Curious, he opens the box and found himself looking at a collection of casette tapes, each marked with different titles. Excited, he rushed to listen to the tapes. What he hears is the story of the girl named Hannah Baker-a girl he has had a crush on for as long as he can remember. Hannah Baker, the girl who committed suicide, telling her side of the story, of thirteen reasons why she did what she did.<br /><br />Review: I don't want to get ahead of myself here, but I'll go straight to the point with this one. I loved this book, and I definitely recommend it. Though technically a young adult book, I have to say that I think any reader of any age would appreciate this story. It was honest, thought-provoking, and just simply engrossing.<br /><br />I honestly don't think that I can write a review and do it justice, as I will sound like a broken record, telling you to grab the book and read it as soon as you can.<br /><br />If you're like me, you sometimes get attached to the characters and their stories if the story is really good, and I know I may sound like a total cliche when I say this, but I just did not want to put the book down. In truth, it was because I was just drawn to it, but it was also because I did not want it to end.<br /><br />I won't write a long review for this one, but I must emphasize that this is a MUST READ, no matter how old you are.
0143034901|5.0|What a great book. It has great characters, several subplots, and wonderful atmosphere with narrow cobble stone streets in the fog and rain.

0815411839|5.0|Donald Spoto's biography of Marilyn Monroe is not only captivating, but insightful and throughly researched.  Tracing the distressed Norma Jean's early life to her evolvement into \\"The Monroe,\\" to her troubled adulthood and final days, Spoto presents the facts that surrounded her life in great honesty and detail.  Spoto strings together his research with a narrative that is both truthful and sympathetic, leaving the reader with a very humanistic  and touching portrait of one of the most legendary icons in American culture.    This biography is the most throughly researched biography of Marilyn that I have read, research being the most crucial element of any biographical work to the speculative reader.  Spoto even includes an afterword in which he details how much of the public has been unwittingly and unfoundedly enticed to believe that Marilyn's death was directly related to the Kennedy family.  For any Monroe fan or researcher, Spoto's denouncement of the Kennedy-Monroe conspiracy--and moreover--his proof and research that support this denouncement, is a crucial and unique aspect of this biography, one that seperates it from many of the other biographies about Marilyn Monroe.    While I also recommend Barbara Leaming's biography [[ASIN:0609805533 Marilyn Monroe]] as it contains some information which Spoto's does not (and his like-wise discloses information hers does not), I would recommend Spoto's as a first choice due to the amount of research and sources on which the text is based.    If you are looking for pictures of Marilyn, then look for a pictoral instead.  The pictures inluded in this biography are relevant to the text, but are some of the most commonly seen black and white photos of Monroe.
0143034901|5.0|There has been so much enthuasiastic praise about this english publication of the famous Spanish novel by a talented author, Carlo Ruis Zafon. You know when there is so much hype about a certain book, you usually read in caution, trying to analyze if you are liking the book more and more. And if you end up not liking it the same way others did, then you are just disappointed. However, when a hyped book starts delivering by its every word.. that's when you know enthusiasm is well-deserved.<br /><br />The novel is rare, a little obscure. I can not type out the summary or even the main plot of the book, for it is far too complex for me to do that. I will say, that this is a story of many things; mystery, family, fantasy, love stories, politics, etc. The most important thing when you are reading this is that you take your time. Do not rush it. This book is meant to be understood and taken delicately.<br /><br />It could have been shorter than what it is, and a little bit more coherent at times. It is a bit melodramatic at times, but even then, the important literary elements were served. Honestly though, I didn't really care. The writing was too good to care about those petit things. The characters were memorable, and there were just the right amount of everything. This book is definitely one of those I would definitely recommend, read again, and even buy. Read it!

0312945973|5.0|River God was a hotbed of contradictions for me. I plowed through its first few sections in a pace so sluggish even I was aghast. The introduction by the slave Taita of the young Lady Lostris and the dashing warrior-slash-boyfriend Tanus was not that compelling enough to make me want to stick through. Just a few millimeters thick (or thin, as it applied) into the novel and I tossed it aside, there to gather a film of dust, earning my silent reproach for failing to engage me any better.<br /><br />Then by dint of force - and the fact that I felt ashamed of my purposeful ignoring of \\"A Novel of Ancient Egypt\\" - I opened the pages again and picked up where I left off (right around before Tanus rescued the royal barge from being crushed to bits, just in case someone out there's curious).<br /><br />And that was when I quickly realized the folly of `giving up too soon,' seeing as how the novel reared its contradictory head again. This time, the pace mercilessly picks up - Tanus, commander of the elite Blue Crocodile squadron, saves the Pharaoh's life with humility and aplomb, quickly endearing him to the masses. He would later be granted high honors and entrusted a burden so heavy only a few men would dare envy. Lostris' station in life takes a dramatic change, almost concurrent with the wave of destruction Egypt is about to experience in the hands of the Hyksos.<br /><br />Through it all is the voice of the slave Taita. Humble and obeisant at the outset, but his knowledge and skills in almost all things medicinal, artistic, architectural, and mystical (among numerous other things) make him one of the most valuable `resources' in the kingdom. His arrogance and pride over his not inconsiderable talents is probably only surmounted by the fierce love and loyalty he holds for both Lostris and Tanus. An Egyptian slave he may be in the eyes of the world, but for these two young lovers, he is an ardent friend and companion. And he has saved their hides and solved problems for them more times than any of them care to count.<br /><br />It is through the eyes of Taita that one of the most overwhelming upheavals in Ancient Egyptian history is recounted. Under the sheer might of the Hyksos, the royal court is forced into exile, to brave the lashing currents of the cataracts, further and further south until it reaches Cush to where the Nile forks into the Blue and White Nile.<br /><br />It was during the journey to and the transient settlement into this region that the tattered remains of the court and military of \\"this Very Egypt of theirs\\" fiercely, if painstakingly, shored up and rebuilt its forces, always drawing strength in their vow to one day take back Thebes from the `Shepherd Kings.'<br /><br />What finally made me stay glued to this novel was this journey south. The discoveries and inventions Taita chronicled over these many years of travel were told in an engaging format. He is a man with a bottomless thirst for new knowledge and for unchartered land. His forays into finding the solution to the military's logistical problems are almost always too uncanny for my taste - Smith might as well have said that this eunuch was one of the greatest inventors in Ancient Egypt never to be made known. Taita is practically made the silent founder of various advances in engineering, surgery, and military tactics.<br /><br />If you could get past this too-good-to-be-true list of achievements, the narrative is then very easy to latch onto and enjoy. There are vivid descriptions of flora and fauna. Nail-biting chronicles of skirmishes with man and beast. Endearing anecdotes of the young prince of Egypt as he grows into manhood and takes after his charismatic father. There's romance, valor, camaraderie, and even a dash of dry humor, as well as surprisingly heartrending losses.<br /><br />All of these `told' through the practical, mellifluous, and sometimes dryly caustic voice of the long-suffering Taita, his affection and pride for Lostris and Tanus never flagging. His adoration and nostalgia for the birthplace they had left seeping through the pages despite his wanderlust.<br /><br />Ancient Egypt has never been more vivid, dramatic, and richly-textured. Under Wilbur Smith's pen, it was, at turns, grandiose and flawed. There was the Egypt that was showered with glittering riches and vibrant hues of grandeur. On the obverse, it was riddled with strife, corruption, and poverty. Ostensibly under the whims of the gods, the Nile can spell both doom and prosperity. The lands on either side of it can surrender either limitless bounty or treacherous dangers. Its people can exemplify wisdom and `culture', while also falling pray into greed, arrogance, and prejudice.<br /><br />For all these facets of \\"this Very Egypt of theirs\\", River God stands as one of the most enjoyable (and quite frankly instructive) accounts I've ever had about this great civilization.<br /><br />And to think I almost consigned it to my never-even-bother-to-read-pile.hey had left seeping through the pages despite his wanderlust.

B003CIG7AE|3.0|Like some other reviewers, I really don't have any history with Band of Horses, so I approach this third album with an open mind.  It kicks off with an impressive trifecta of rocking anthems, \\"Factory\\", \\"Compliments\\", and \\"Laredo,\\" but then things quickly wind down from there.  The band has a pleasing enough sound, a California-style brand of folk-rock with echoes of everyone from The Eagles to America to Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young to Fleet Foxes. There's plenty of jangle and tight harmonies to carry the album, but after a while the energy and the interest just seems to flag.
0064407667|5.0|I absolutely adore \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\". I picked up the first book on a whim and devoured the entire series in a month. It had been a long time since I really enjoyed a book series like this. Author Daniel Handler (aka Lemony Snickett) brings the much needed absurd in this mock-goth book series. The world of these books is rich, fun and extremely dreadful (but entertaining).<br /><br />The tone and form of the book are unique, so don't try to compare it to other series. This is a set all on it's own. It's always fun to read and see how the Baudelaires will cope with their situation.<br /><br />I also love that, unlike most kids' stories where the children lose their parents, the Baudelaires actually have to deal with their grief. They never seem to \\"just get over it\\" or have a short cry and it's done. As Lemony Snicket said, \\"\\"It is useless for me to describe to you how terrible Violet, Klaus, and even Sunny felt in the time that followed. If you have ever lost someone very important to you, then you already know how it feels, and if you haven't, you cannot possibly imagine it.\\"
1423101472|5.0|Note: Like all my other reviews for this series, I will not be writing my own synopsis. However, you can read more about it here.<br /><br />The Last Olympian is the final book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians, and as I have said -- over and over again -- I love this series and I am sad that it is over. This is one of those books that I find it hard to part with. This might sound a bit crazy, but this is a kind of story that showcases characters so believable and realistic, that I feel as if I have been reading about them all their lives. Rick Riordan finds a way to paint them vividly -- and with such great justice. Speaking of Rick Riordan, as usual, he delivers once again. The writing and pace are perfect. The perfect balance of humor, wit, and action are maintained and are still there. The story itself is still as intriguing, exciting, and mind bending as it always has been.<br />And though I'm not usually a fan of battle scenes, -- as I always find it a bit challenging to get into them -- I'd have to make an exception for this one. With this action-packed series, I was pleasantly surprised that I found those to be one of the best and most enjoyable parts.<br />Simply put, The Last Olympian is a great book! It is written just as good as the other four, and maybe even better. This ending, as well as the others, starts off incredibly well, rises on top just right, and ends perfectly. It is now one of my favorites, and again, I will give it 5 stars; highly recommended! Now that I'm done with the whole thing, one thing's for sure; I'm definitely going to miss Seaweed Brain.

B000SMWUPS|4.0|I searched high and low for a cupholder for my Uppababy Vista 2010, and I stumbled upon this one.  I read all the reviews on Amazon and I'm so glad that I purchased it.  It's less expensive then the cupholder that Uppababy offers, and it's so much nicer!  I love the fact that it can hold 2 drinks (one for me and one for my hubby- or later on, my baby's sippy cup!), and I like the storage compartment in the middle- great for putting snack, keys, cell phone, sunglasses, whatever!  It even has a small zippered compartment that's barely visible from the pictures.      Great product for the price.  Haven't had any problems with it.  I would give it 5 stars if there was a mechanism that would make it not sway when I'm going over some bumps or onto the sidewalk, but overall, I'm greatly satisfied.
1416550550|5.0|Synopsis: In 1913, a dock master and his wife discovers a four-year-old girl stranded and left alone on a wharf in Australia. She doesn't remember anything about herself, or her past, and all she carries with her are a few of her personal items, kept in a white suitcase, with a book of fairy tales.<br /><br />In 1975, when the girl whose name is Nell, grows up, she goes back to England, where she tries to solve the mysteries of her lost identity. But this was cut short when her granddaughter, Cassandra, was left in her care.<br /><br />When Nell dies, Cassandra, inherits the mystery and questions of her grandmother's past, and decides to finally put together all the pieces to solve the mystery of their origins.<br /><br />Review: Don't let the fact that this book has close to 700 pages scare you off, because if you do, you will miss out on a really good old-fashioned, mysterious story filled with memorable and believable characters.<br /><br />Before I continue with the praising, I do have to say the biggest challenge with this one would be the constant shift to the past, present, and in between. The transitions was not as smooth as I would have liked them to be, that at times the decade jumping got confusing. However, it was something that I learned to be accustomed to. Despite this though, I'd still give it five stars and would still definitely recommend this book!<br /><br />Now to continue on with the praising: I thought the stories intertwined well and the subtle clues were pretty clever. It was definitely intriguing, suspenseful, original, and was extremely well-written. The setting I thought was wonderful, and the right amount of romance, mystery, Gothic-like vibe, and family stories were all nice touches. The ending, as well, was worth the long read, as it was unfolded in such a wonderful and compelling fashion.<br /><br />Definitely one of the BEST books with great writing that I've read this year. The cover looks nice too, just in case you're thinking of getting it. :)
B0016H97LY|4.0|This is the first book I have read about Steve Jobs and I am glad that I did. It is helpful if you are not reading to learn about Steve Jobs but to walk away with some good ideas for your own business, especially about design thinking. The only part I didn't like were the \\"Lessons from Steve\\" part. You can skip them since they do not add much to book, yet break the flow of reading. I recommend this book if you are looking for a fresh approach to business.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|This album is a return to what Tom Petty does best.  Rock, Roll with some Rhythm and Blues.  His last efforts were a bit slow and a bit depressing.  Guitar riffs are good with memorable momentum. Running Man's Bible makes your legs wanna shake a bit like Elvis's Pelvis. Trip to Pirates Cove catches your attention on open, ready to hear a fable as it slowly drifts you away. Candy, well you immediately know by the title it is going to be upbeat and it is, sounding like it was written in New Orleans, \\"I don't drink a coca cola, but I sure like a ol' moonshine\\".  \\"No Reason To Cry\\" is a bit too slow for my taste and it is to me a weak song, unless your into listening to it drinking moonshine in the middle of the night over a campfire.  \\"I Should Have Known It\\" is a strong blues based song with a strong opening guitar riff with a strong solid Rock tempo, reminds me a bit of Led Zeppelin.  \\"U.S 41\\" borrows some Paul McCartney vocal pitch change but it has strong Southern Blues Roots.  \\"Taking My Time\\" sounds like something Robin Trower would have played on guitar, but has a strong slow beat that sounds colossal and again, southern blues.  \\"Let Yourself Go\\" has a faster blues beat that adds a harmonica riff now and then along with a steady beat.  \\"Don't Pull Me Over\\" sounds almost Reggae in it's tempo but it is Tom's Vocals that are recorded to give the impression that he is like a ghost, especially when he slowly sings \\"Don't Pull Me Over, I Got Mouths To Feed\\".  \\"Lovers Touch\\" is strong Blues that gives a very laid back relaxing mesmerizing tempo. \\"High in The Morning\\" is another Rocker and Blues combination and a Great Song. \\"Something Good Coming\\" makes you want to hear the story behind the music, somehow the mellow style makes you want to know about what is coming, it is very very deep emotionally and Beautiful at that.  \\"Good Enough\\" again is blues, however it epitomizes the entire emotion and sound of the album.  \\"Little Girl Blues\\" is a fast paced Blues Rocker.  Tom Petty does a great job as a story teller and has come out with a fantastic album.  So my advice.  Buy the Entire Album not just a song or two if you like Tom Petty or Eric Clapton.Tom Petty does a great job as a story teller and has come out with a fantastic album.  So my advice.

B003RS1V1E|5.0|First, let me say that I don't think anybody has created a bad guy as realistic as the one on this show.  If you've read that evil can be essentially a banal characteristic, that is certainly true of this villain.  Gus, the villain, meets with Walt after Walt has gone against all of his wishes.  He'd like to kill him but it is truly like killing the goose which laid the golden egg.  Gus forces Walt to take the former lab assistant and obviously plans on killing Walt as soon as as the other guy can cook meth.  I loved it at one point where Gus was insulted that anyone could think he would kill a child as part of his drug empire's dealing. It is obvious he will kill anyone who gets in his way but he has views of himself which imply he has certain good characteristics left in his nature.  He doesn't. So it comes down to this: Gus is now Walt's and Jesse's enemy.  How can they survive him?  That is the crux of the concluding episode and obviously will be the opening of season 4.<br /><br />This is one of the very best shows on tv and it should do very well on the Emmys.  Cranston deserves every Emmy he is winning for playing Walt.
0679746048|3.0|This is a memoir written by Susanna Kaysen; a woman in the late 1960s who was sent to a mental institution and diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder.<br /><br />First of all, let me say that I have never read a memoir as honest, raw, and straight to the point as this one. It started out well. The writing was well written, but even after this book, I have to say that I don't really know anything about the author at all. She left a lot (too many) stuff out.<br /><br />The good thing is that it's an interesting story overall, and the fact that it's non fiction makes it even better. It was readable and at times, even thought-provoking. The bad thing is, personally, I found it just to be too flat for my taste.<br /><br />However, I just watched the movie the other day, and loved it! I was never really a huge fan of Angelina Jolie (except in 2008 film Changeling), but this one definitely changed my mind about her. In fact, everybody's performance in this film was great. This made me laugh, get scared, be bothered, and even cry in one particular scene in the end. Awesome movie, okay book, great story.
0375842209|5.0|I loved this book (in the way you can love a sad story).  The way it was written, the narrator, was very different to what I have read before.  I loved the imagery, the use of color.  I cried the last 20 pages.  A very worthwhile read!  Highly recommended!

B002SJIO5E|5.0|We ordered this and shut it off cause in the beginning it looked boring and stupid and I didn't know what the content was, but months later I still had the DVD and put it on since we had nothing else to watch and WE LOVED IT.  The movie was very thoughtful on issues and the creatures were fascinating along with the content of the story.  It's a totally cool movie that leaves you thinking and never drained in confusion and it's sensational without making you brain fried from special effects.  10 stars to the creators. ouivalerie
1439102813|5.0|Synopsis: Alice Howland is the epitome of a successful woman. She is a cognitive psychology professor at Harvard and a world-renowned expert in linguistics. She is married to a successful husband and has three grown and independent children. But in one unexpected and terrifying diagnosis, she is forced to adapt to the changes in her life -- and her relationships -- forever.<br /><br />Review: I just finished this book less than an hour ago, and I have to tell you the truth, I am still sitting here, left completely heart broken by its story.<br />I will try not to make this a long review, so I will get to the point: This is a book you have to read. It is a haunting story -- a poignant portrait of Alzheimer's.<br />I can't even begin to explain to you, how I have always felt that Alzheimer's disease is one of the worst illnesses to have. With Alzheimer's, it's as if you have no choice with your own life anymore. You lose your mind -- everything about it; memories, feelings, thoughts, knowledge. You forget how to do basic things from urinating to finding the bathroom in your own home. You forget how to read. You forget how to write. You forget what you just said a minute ago. You even forget how to speak. Over time, the person with this harrowing disease will wake up not even remembering their own name, who their loved ones are, how old they are, where they are, among many other things. Though there are medication to help for the progression to slow, there is no cure. I can only hope that someday, there will be.<br />Still Alice by Lisa Genova is a book that had to be told, and one I highly recommend everyone to read. It is a heart wrenching and unforgettable story that is written to call for awareness.
B00004YX39|3.0|I bought Gaucho on vinyl in 1980. However, as I spent a fortune duplicating my record collection on CD, including buying each of the first six by Steely Dan, I steered clear of Gaucho. It really wasn't even a conscious decision. I didn't see it in the rack and say to myself \\"um, don't have that. Oh, yes I remember, I never really cared for it in the first place. So, no\\". It was more like Gaucho was something by, say, REO Speedwagon - a CD I wouldn't buy even if I has unlimited resources. However, I was at a friend's house some time ago and he played his newly acquired Gaucho CD. Liked it, Bought it. It then sat in a CD rack until now. When I went to play it, just minutes ago, I discovered that I had never even removed the plastic wrapping!<br /><br />As I sit here, several years later, listening again to this recording I rather think that my initial 1980 assessment was correct. On the positive side, Gaucho is as well-recorded and played as one could possibly want. There are a couple of great songs (Babylon Sisters, Glamour Profession). On the negative side, it is very close in style and content to Aja yet it never quite stacks up. With thousands of records to choose from the question I ask myself is why would I take this CD off the shelf rather than Aja? In a wine context it is a tasty Aussie Shiraz - a great blast right off the top - but tiring rather too quickly, while Aja is well-aged Bordeaux - perhaps a little more subtle and definitely more complex, and delicious to the last drop.<br /><br />One final note - Gaucho fails for me because I absolutely loved Steely Dan and after an absence of three years I expected more. After all, the band had rarely stood still throughout its brief but illustrious career. I didn't want a reprise of Aja. On the other hand, had Gaucho been a record released in 1980 by an unknown band as its debut I would have been mightily impressed.<br /><br />Well, it is now late 2013. I was driving yesterday and the next cd that I grabbed was Gaucho. Popped it in the player and within ten minutes was thinking to myself \\"what exactly don't you like about this record Philip?\\" Babylon Sisters and Hey Nineteen get the enterprise off to a cracking good start. Glamour Profession is pretty damned good. And then along came a trio of songs that is for me the least interesting three consecutive songs on any of Steely Dan's first seven records. The music is undeniably slick, well produced and played. However, I find it empty, the lyrics lacking the duo's usual sharpness and humour, the music, ever so cool, but lacking feeling.aucho.

0446563048|4.0|I spent the last two years in Happy Valley, PA (Penn State, of course) working toward my MBA at the Smeal College of Business. There, the [...] case study is required reading. Zappos runs its business with a counterintuitive, culture-centric strategy. I wanted to understand where he came up with such a gutsy strategy; Delivering Happiness gives a interesting perspective of Tony's influences and life events in a well-written, relaxed tone. The book is not about the latest/greatest/newest way to approach management; rather, it's about a slight paradigm shift.      Written as three distinct parts, the book takes the reader through different phases of Tony's life. A common theme is that he didn't want or like to do what other people were doing. He needed to find ways to make things better or easier, or to find a way to fill a need. There were many junctures where Tony could have stayed with the status quo and had a perfectly comfortable life. Rather, the way he approached his life was to not just move along with the crowd; this translated to his willingness to see beyond traditional economic reasoning.  What I found most interesting about Tony's Zappos story was the long-term focus on both people and relationships.  I am personally a big believer in relationships; business should be a marathon, not a sprint (a favorite cliché). Arguably, it's the \\"sprint\\" mentality that has caused the current economic and political situation our and other countries face.     Combine the willingness to do more for the customer with empowerment and you get a potent combination that has made Zappos the success that it is.  One final, and perhaps subtle, twist that Tony throws in the book is about people.  Rather than thinking that people are a major asset to the company, he points you to thinking about the human development and employee pipeline as the true asset.  That's a powerful thought.  The book is not without some drawbacks, however.  There are details that the reader would be finewithout and other sections where I was left craving more.  For me, the eventual transaction with Sequoia and the resulting relational dynamic was very interesting; I would have loved it as an entire chapter!    All in all, for me, the book is appealing because it challenged conventional wisdom (innovation), examined the early Zappos' team believing deeply in what they were creating (determination; courage), and got me thinking about the science of happiness and what drives people.  It is a very worthwhile read.
B001EN1R3Q|5.0|This is by far Motley Crue's best album, deffinatly their heaviest sounding. I don't want to put too much personal opinion in here, so I'll stick to what is true. Vince Neil did a good job singing on this album, but, he sounds the same on every album to me. Mick Mars did a lot of good guitar work on heren nothing that really sounded bad. Nikki Sixx did a lot of good bass work and wrote great lyrics as always. Tommy Lee was at his his best as far as studio work here. The whole ablum sounds great, and I never get bored of listening to it.
006176759X|3.0|This book is about reality TV show star Jane Roberts. It focuses on the life in LA; parties, cute boys, everything. It sure sounds like a semi autobiographical by the author, The Hills' very own Lauren Conrad.<br /><br />First of all, I used to watch The Hills. I do like Lauren, and like the fact that she does not try so hard to be somebody else just to fit in. But when I heard she was writing a book, of course, I was skeptical. After having followed her on The Hills, I have never heard of her aspiring to be a writer. I did give her the benefit of the doubt though, and borrowed this from the library.<br /><br />First off, there are good points. It is very straight-forward, almost as if a friend is just having a conversation with you. It is quite interesting, if you like reality TV shows. And if you are a fan of The Hills, then you will enjoy this even more.<br /><br />However.. and there are a lot of howevers, the topic has been done too many times before; A girl who moves out, goes to a different city, and moves in with a close friend, experiencing new and exciting things. Also, not only is the writing pedantic, it also quite confusing. The resolution was not done well, if the ending of the book was even a resolution.<br /><br />I would never think of purchasing this book, probably will never read it again, and most likely won't recommend it at all. But it was a fun way to pass time. Light, but can be engaging if you try to get into it. If you are going to read this, try to take it for what it is.
0894803123|5.0|I bought this book back in the 1980s when it was first printed. It's so dog-eared and has food spills on it from years of use, I decided to buy a fresh copy. Homemade ice cream, for me, used to be a complex, time-consuming endeavor before this book. Ben and Jerry share their recipes and ice cream tips, which are absolutely simple to make. No cooking required. But let's address the raw egg issue and how I solved it.    I read several comments about the raw eggs called for in the recipes. Since the 1980s I always made this ice cream with raw eggs and no illnesses. Maybe I'm just more paranoid as I get older, but I didn't want to use raw eggs this time. But I didn't want to leave the eggs out, as I think they are essential to the consistency of the ice cream. And I didn't want the hassle of cooking the recipe. My solution was using pasteurized shell eggs.    I read some reviews here and elsewhere and found that you can purchase pasteurized shell eggs. A company called Davidson's makes them. They're not easy to find in the Bay Area where I live, but there was one store (Bristol Farms) that sold them in San Francisco. I bought a dozen there.    Also, I read another comment in which the person called Ben and Jerry's and was told that they could use Egg Beaters in place of raw eggs. I've never used Egg Beaters for anything, but have seen them in my grocery store. They are eggs that have been cracked and pasteurized and put into a little carton. I couldn't find any \\"plain\\" Egg Beaters in my grocery store that didn't have seasoning in them, so I went with the Davidson's pasteurized shell eggs. They come in a container just like regular shell eggs. They ARE regular shell eggs, but they've gone through some process to eliminate bacteria that could make you sick. When you crack them, they are raw, but they are okay to eat raw. Davidson's has a web site ([...]) which will reassure you.    With this raw egg issue out of the way, I want to say that this is the perfect ice cream book, especially if you're a fan of Ben and Jerry's and you like homemade ice cream.    By the way, they have three basic sweet cream recipes. Two of those don't even require eggs; and many recipes incorporate the sweet cream base, such as Strawberry, Peanut Butter, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, etc., and you can choose which sweet cream base to use. I like the sweet cream base that uses the raw eggs, but that's my personal preference. However, I just made the sweet cream base with the condensed sweetened milk, and it was quite good.     This book could use an update to include the flavors that were created over the last 20 years. But with some imagination, you can adapt some of them to match. For example, Chunky Monkey was not formulated when this book was written, but there is recipe for Banana ice cream. I made the banana ice cream and added 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/2 cup chocolate chunks. Ta-da! It is almost identical to Chunky Monkey.     They also have some flavors that we might not have seen in the store, such as Maple Grape Nuts, Strawberry Coconut, Banana Peanut Butter, Beer Sorbet, Oreo Mint Cookie using chocolate ice cream, and a lot of others. They also have three recipes for chocolate ice cream: Ben's Chocolate, Jerry's Chocolate, and Light Chocolate.     The simplicity of the recipes are what make this such a great book. Milk, cream, eggs, sugar and whatever other specific flavor ingredients needed. Mix 'em up and pour into the ice cream maker. A couple of recipes require you to chill the cream mix for a little while (Ben's Chocolate, for example), but most of them are mix the ingredients, pour into the ice cream maker, and 20-30 minutes later you've got your ice cream.     These recipes are darn good. This gourmet ice cream is rich and tastes like a real professional made it.     One note: They say to add your chunks (Heath Bars, cookies, chips, etc.) about 2 minutes before the ice cream is done. My ice cream maker [[ASIN:B00000JGRT Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice-Cream Maker, White]]  doesn't like the big chunks--larger than a chocolate chip, so I add them after the ice cream finishes. The ice cream is usually still soft enough to use a big plastic spoon and stir in the chunks before putting into the containers, which I also bought from Amazon [[ASIN:B00381DIR0 Plain White Pint Size Frozen Dessert Containers]].     This is a user-friendly book, which is entertaining and has silly illustrations. But the recipes are no-nonsense as far as working exactly as expected. Some of my favorite recipes are Oreo Mint Cookie (using either vanilla or chocolate ice cream--and I use Newman's Oreo-like cookies), Banana, Strawberry, Orange Cream Dream, Ben's Chocolate with almonds, Peanut Butter, Vanilla Malt and Butter Pecan, to name a few. I have not tried the Coconut yet, nor have I tried the sorbets. I also experimented with using some Girl Scout Cookies--breaking up the Peanut Butter sandwich cookies and putting them in sweet cream. Yum.    Get yourself some pasteurized eggs (if you are concerned about raw eggs), and have fun making ice cream. Someone mentioned that this book, along with an ice cream maker would make a good gift. I agree. Good stuff!!
B00004YTIQ|2.0|I was hopeful about this item. We had a pool cover before but it did not stay in place so the fact that this had draw string really seemed perfect. Well we have only had it for a couple of weeks and it is already ripping all over. It is really cheap and is a waste of money because it's not going to last through the summer. I love the draw string idea. If it was only thicker and made out of a better material it would be great. But it's not and I would not buy again.
0316010669|3.0|The subject is good, not new. Many times experts can thin slice the available information can decide in a blink of a second . What qualities make them so good? or the other way around-what they missed?     I think the experience that counts when thin slicing, making decisions in split seconds. But what about when the timing of the decision is not crucial? Law enforcement officers on patrol vs. Getty's Kouros    Does the first impressions e.g. first decision, has impact when reconsidering the case again? How much bias do we have? Can the 'gut feeling' be changed?
0375846735|4.0|This is the final book of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. As I have mentioned in The Subtle Knife review, nobody can deny that Pullman has such a huge talent in capturing a reader's attention through his engaging characters and the very intriguing and interesting plot. I would definitely recommend this series to others.<br /><br />Having said that, I think I should mention it that though this was meant to be a work of fiction; subversive literature, there are definitely hidden agendas and meanings here and there about Christianity and the like. But before you think, C.S. Lewis, I'll say now that Philip Pullman is actually quite the opposite. Though both writers are extremely talented, they have such different hidden meanings and agendas.<br /><br />Truthfully though, even if there is so much controversy to this trilogy, I really didn't mind. Why? Because it was a good story. It was exciting, strange, and unique. I loved the characters of Will and Lyra most especially. Although there are some loose ends and less than satisfactory conclusions, I still consider it ONE of the great fantasy books around. That seemed to be enough for me.
B002CLBJPK|1.0|This copy of the movie contains all the scenes that were deleted from the original movie, and they were cut for good reason. Normally I like seeing deleted scenes, but these scenes actually changed the movie. The original cut is great, but the deleted scenes ruined it, I wish I had bought the original.

B002DD46P2|2.0|Just like the second movie, this album score is a disappointment.  The score is nowhere near as good as the first movie, reflecting the actual movie.  I went against my better judgement and bought, you shouldn't make the same mistake.
014241543X|5.0|Synopsis: Mia and her family has just been in a terrible and fatal car accident. In an instant, she finds herself -- her physical self, at least -- at the hospital, as doctors and nurses struggle to keep her alive. While in a coma, she reminisces about the key events and stories in her life, as she tries to figure out what to do with herself. Soon, she realizes that what she ultimately has to do, is to choose and make the biggest decision in her life: Should she stay or should she go?<br /><br />Review: If I Stay tells an original story through such a unique point-of-view. I don't think I've ever read a book like this before; plot-wise. And I have to say, this is one novel that deserves a 5-star rating. It is raw and honest, inspiring and sobering, heartbreaking and uplifting all at the same time.<br />First of all, I loved the main characters, and truly felt for them. I found that none of them fell into any of the character cliches that we all dislike so much. They were all believable and likable -- especially Mia herself, her best friend, Kim, and her boyfriend, Adam.<br />Aside from the characters, I also loved the overall flow of the story. I liked how it showed Mia's memories and her present life. I liked that the story took place in the course of just one night. It really gave emphasis on how heavy the events were as the hours went on.<br />I also kind of liked the fact that it was a very fast read, with just 196 pages. Like I already mentioned though, I think the flow helped a lot with the pace. I was never bored, and in fact, I literally could not put the book down. I know that's such a cliche thing to say, but it's definitely true for me.<br />Overall, I liked this book a lot. It is quite bittersweet, but I think that it just wouldn't have the same impact and feel to it, if it was done differently. That being said, this is one novel I'm glad I picked up, and one that I highly recommend.
B002JVWR54|5.0|Whedon made the conceivable plausible with this Sci-fi action series.  While Season 1 did seem to get a little redundant, thanks I hear to the Fox Execs micromanaging the series, in Season 2, Whedon was given full reign and the story took off and grew from there. The conspiracy at the end (prior to the futuristic episodes) and plot twist were very well done.  Unfortunately, by the beginning of Season 2, many had already abandoned the show due to some of the redundancy of Season 1.  And Fox, being INFAMOUS for cancelling GREAT science fiction shows on Friday (ex. Firefly, Sarah Connor Chronicles, etc.) of course did what they do... move a show geared towards 20 & 30 Somethings to Friday primetime (when MOST 20 & 30 somethings are away from home) and then cancel the show. With the invention & popularity of the Tivo, LIVE viewership numbers are outdated and an unrealistic tally of actual viewers.  Anyway, it was sad to see the show get hacked up at the end.  It seemed like the last few episodes, after the cancellation announcement were incoherent & edited out of sequence or they just tried to cram too much in to finish up the concept or something along those lines.  I'm sure that we have FOX to blame for that too.  Well, I'm hoping for a missing episode or 2 and some extras to explain the disfunctionality at the very end of the season.
0393075966|5.0|In \\"Freefall\\", Joseph Stiglitz presents a lucid, compelling and damning indictment of the U.S. financial system and he does so in terms the non-specialist can easily grasp, both intellectually and emotionally. Stiglitz is supremely qualified to analyze the \\"Great Recession\\", given his unparalleled record of accomplishment in the economic sphere.  The story Stiglitz tells is so aggravating and infuriating that, perhaps in another time and in another place, it would have provoked mobs to run through the streets with guilty heads pulled from the feed-trough and mounted on pikestaffs.<br /><br />In brief, \\"Freefall\\" presents the still unfolding tale of The Great Recession, the sad series of events foretold by the incendiary combination of greed, hubris, cavalier disregard of financial realities, negligence, magical and ideological thinking that seemed (and still seems) to pervade the American financial industry, the consumer society and the community of business and academic financial experts who advise them.  According to Stiglitz, memory is short and, by the time Ronald Reagan (himself a child of the Depression) assumed office, the lessons of the Great Depression were largely forgotten (or dismissed as dusty antiquities).  The regulatory legislation of the Depression years (such as the Glass-Steagall act, which separated consumer from investment banking) was undermined (and finally discarded during the Clinton Administration).  Faith in the \\"hidden hand\\" of the \\"free market\\" produced a form of financial myopia that opened the door to the current mess.<br /><br />Stiglitz devotes a considerable portion of the book to discussing and analyzing the ideology of the Milton Freidman/University of Chicago school.  The Chicago doctrine holds that an unregulated market is a  \\"perfect market\\".  This radical economic doctrine became reigning dogma in American governmental and financial circles. This doctrine, when coupled with the natural penchant for short-term gains, created a sense of entitlement to extraordinary salaries and bonuses, uncoupled from tangible accomplishment in the banking/financial classes.  In other words, a sense of entitlement ran rampant through the executive suites.  Eventually, other mechanisms of legislative oversight were degraded, dismissed or unenforced, thereby setting the necessary preconditions for the Recession. Reality remained hidden behind a fog of ideology.<br /><br />While it is understandable (if not necessarily forgivable) self-interest that motivated Wall Street, the role of the U.S. Government is less so.  The Federal Government facilitated the decline in accountability using hidden subsidies, for example, in the form of FDIC coverage, repeated bank bailouts, low- or no-interest loans, favorable tax laws, etc.  A \\"revolving door\\" between the corporate executive suite and the legislative office provided the basis for perpetuating the status quo. Meanwhile, there was a real and substantive decline in wages for the average earner.  When coupled with the unflagging desire to live beyond available means (if only to maintain a prior standard of living) an unmet need was created:  the need for plenty of consumer credit.  This was enabled by aggressive, often deceptive and sometimes frankly false marketing to the American consumer, who was encouraged to borrow, borrow, borrow (against credit cards and home equity) to make ends meet.<br /><br />The rising prices in the housing market were the foundation for this attack on reason and common sense.  The gullible and unsophisticated worker was induced by unscrupulous mortgage sellers into purchasing arcane mortgage packages and then to borrow against home equity (whether it existed or not).  As a result, the American worker ended up in insurmountable debt.  This entire enterprise was predicated on and justified by the fatuous and fanciful notion that there was, in America, an economic \\"perpetual motion machine\\", this in the form of a never-ending rise in housing prices.  The positive feedback loop was reinforced and further lubricated by ridiculously complex schemes for disbursing risk.  To further hide the magnitude of risk involved with these products, they were given AAA ratings by agencies such as Moody's who, in turn, derived their revenue from the very institutions selling the securities!  Banks were highly leveraged and their products, while generating King Midas-like commissions rendered them insolvent in the event of a problem.  In short, a combination of the same, recurring, fantastic and ultimately irrational behaviors that have produced just about every financial debacle were in place to produce a disaster and, as before that happened when, as it always will, the \\"bubble\\" burst.  This time, however, the consequences for the American and world-wide economy were devastating. Still, the bankers made off with fortunes.  There have been no significant criminal prosecutions.  There have been no meaningful financial regulatory reforms.  Public anger is rising.  Citizen confidence in government probity and competence is ebbing.  The financial hogs continue to slurp at the money trough.<br /><br />Stiglitz relates all the above in orderly progression with all the necessary detail but with very little economic arcana and no undefined professional jargon.  In addition to cataloguing the many problems and defining their genesis, he also gives prescriptions for fixing them.  Unfortunately, neither the current (Obama) Administration nor its immediate predecessor (the G.W. Bush Administration) has chosen a rational course for reparing the damage and has done little (or perhaps nothing) to establish the regulatory framework required to prevent the next freefall.  In fact, it their actions seem to reinforce the notion that America is governed by a plutocracy and that our government lacks principled, disciplined, responsible leadership which is capable of restructuring the economy to build the basis for a secure future. As the solutions Stiglitz proffers are so clearly and compellingly stated, one can only speculate on why these have not been adopted or at least candidly discussed (one possible answer:  \\"Follow the money\\").<br /><br />Obviously, the financial crisis is still in evolution.  It seemed at the time Stiglitz wrote \\"Freefall\\" that the \\"freefall\\" was over.  Yet, commercial real estate securities are next on the crisis horizon (2012) and the resolution of the Eurozone conundrum (the Greek component of which was facilitated by Goldman Sachs engineered derivatives) is not yet clear. So, the problems are multifold, complex and enduring:  the consequences of all this cannot yet be fully understood.<br /><br />While there are multiple \\"externalities\\", it seems that the foundational problem lies at the heart of the American social contract:  What is done for the public good? How can the financial system and our system of governance be more responsive to social needs as opposed to personal gain and fealty to special interests?  What do we owe to each other as members of this society?  Stiglitz addresses these larger philosophical issues, mostly by raising the appropriate questions.  Worrisomely, I sense that Stiglitz's concern is that, while history never repeats itself, people always do (to paraphrase Voltaire).edback loop was reinforced and further lubricated by ridiculously complex schemes for disbursing risk.

How can the financial system and our system of governance be more responsive to social needs as opposed to personal gain and fealty to special interests?  What do we owe to each other as members of this society?  Stiglitz addresses these larger philosophical issues, mostly by raising the appropriate questions.  Worrisomely, I sense that Stiglitz's concern is that, while history never repeats itself, people always do (to paraphrase Voltaire).
B0000DBJDM|5.0|The video and sound quality of this DVD is superb.  It is hard to believe that this was recorded and filmed in 1971 and shows the attention to detail both the director and the band put towards the original performance.  The director's cut version is great because you get to see some \\"behind the scenes\\" interview with the original band members.  The performance versions of their classic songs in my opinion are even better that the studio versions.  Of course if you like Pink Floyd then you already know that Echoes in epic, but the performance versions of Careful With That Axe Eugene, Saucerful of Secrets and Set The Controls For The Heart of The Sun are incrediable.  I highly recommend this DVD to any Pink Floyd enthusiast.  I'm just sorry it took me so long to discover it.
0743454537|3.0|I have always had mixed feelings about this one. And I have to admit, this is a bit harder to write a review for. I even have a hard time answering anyone who asks me if they should read this book or not. I usually can't give a straight answer right away.<br /><br />I guess you could say my opinions go both ways. I liked it and did not like it at the same time. There were parts I loved, and others, I didn't so much. First, I'd like to say that My Sister's Keeper actually does have an interesting plot. And overall, it simply has a good story. It's inspiring, heartfelt, thought-provoking, and very believable. Backed up with memorable characters and the author's ability to make you empathize with them and their situations, I thought it was a good read.<br /><br />**slight spoilers**<br /><br />However, and this is a big however, I really wished Jodi Picoult stopped writing and finished the book about 20 pages before the actual ending. That was the one part I did not like at all, which goes back to a friend's question, \\"Should I read it?\\" And as bad as I may feel about it, I tell them not to.<br /><br />It's not that it was bad. It was just very disappointing to have that kind of good build up in the plot and character development, and be let down in the end. So if you prefer a \\"happier\\" ending, please go see the movie instead.<br /><br />**end spoilers**<br /><br />Overall, I sort of liked the book, but was unfortunately, left feeling a bit disappointed.<br /><br />And just to put it out there, I did like the movie better than the actual novel itself. Sorry.
B00362DRNG|5.0|Great collection from self titled album.Different,darker versions of Girls On Film,Planet Earth.You could tell this is 1980/81.Mix of New Romantic,Disco,Funk,especially Simon singing a different tone to songs.DVD with videos I haven't seen in years.CD one with the B sides,why was Late Bar a b side,should have been put on the album.They should kept Tel Aviv the way it was,instead of an instrumental,which I never listen to away.    For all the critics out there,and I do not mean us here in this forum,why diss on DD for being a video band.Hey,they used MTV and MTV used them at the time when music videos were taking off.For the \\"purists\\" who rip DD,I' bet the house if MTV came about in the 70's,all those great 70's bands would have done the same thing.  Record Company:Make a video  70's band:No,we don't do that silly stuff!  R C.Make video,you sell more albums and singles.(wink!)  70's band:where do we sign up!    Duran Duran,keep on making music,and for all those so call bands,you never heard of them any more.Hmmm!    Update:Why wasn't Late Bar or Faster Than Light or Like An Angel put on the album or at least on Rio?I still think a great first album would have been a lot better or would have been a better Rio album.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the best workout video i have ever used. It has 3 levels to choose from and you can modify the exercises until you are strong enough to do them all. All you need is hand weights and 20 minutes! You really do notice a big difference after just a few workouts. I actually felt challenged and i never feel that way from workout videos. I have been doing this video for at least 6 months now and it keeps me strong. My workout partner and i were so inspired from doing this video we started running and have done a 5K and are now working on a 10K. Everyone should try this!!!!
B003A4IFGY|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers and I give this CD 4.5 stars.  Personally, I don't think it's quite as good as Highway Companion, which I think is his absolute best.  Some of the songs are brilliant but there are some throw aways (The Trip To Pirate's Cove, Takin' My Time, High In The Morning).  My favorite tunes are First Flash Of Freedom, Let Yourself Go, Don't Pull Me Over, I Should Have Known It, Something Good Coming, and Good Enough.  It's amazing that Tom Petty can still be so creative after all these years.  Along with Bob Dylan, John Fogerty, Toy Caldwell, and Steve Earle, I think Tom Petty ranks up there as one of the best American songwriters of all time.  This is a very solid CD and it was well worth the wait!
0375836675|5.0|I don't know if I've mentioned this before, but Markus Zusak's The Book Thief is one of my favorite books. Having read the rest of the author's works, I think it's also safe to say that he's one of my favorite authors now. So if you are also a fan, or want to be, I can definitely say this novel will NOT disappoint.<br /><br />Synopsis: I Am the Messenger is about nineteen-year-old, Ed Kennedy. He's just an average, normal teenage guy. A self-proclaimed failure; He didn't try in school, and now he chose a job as a taxi driver because it was the easiest one he could find. In his spare time, he just hangs out with three of his best friends, just lounging around.<br />Until one day, on a seemingly normal trip to the bank, they found themselves in the middle of a robbery. When the robber decided to run for it and attempt to escape, Ed Kennedy decided to chase after him, and eventually, was able to stop him. After this \\"heroic\\" move, everyone thought of him as some sort of savior.<br />Then one day he received something random in the mail; a card--an Ace of Diamonds. On the card, were three addresses, with corresponding times on them. For a while, he was only confused and did not have an idea what to do. But eventually, he started to realize that these cards meant for something more special and more important than he has ever done in his entire life. He was given an important task; to be a messenger, and to deliver \\"messages\\" to specific people. The question is, can he deliver them, and is he capable of doing what is asked of him?<br /><br />Review: I loved this novel so much. I loved the characters, the situations, the writing, the flow, the ending... everything.<br />Though not as good as The Book Thief, I don't think of it any less at all. I feel like the magnitude of Marcus Zusak's writing was the same. The development of the characters (and the plot) were smoothly done, making it very easy for me to empathize with all of them as well as the story itself.<br />And of course, as expected in a story coming from the author, the message to its readers were genuine and real. It didn't seem contrived or forced, and to me, that counts a lot. It's hard to take a book seriously when it becomes preachy in an extremely pretentious way.<br />Obviously, the book is too far-fetched and too \\"fantastical\\" to happen in real life, but I think that the point of it was not to deliver actual reality. I think the point was to to push us to think about other people than just ourselves, and for us to believe that somehow, each and everyone of us is capable of possibly changing the world, simply by doing good and kind things for others.<br /><br />To sum it all up, it is a very good book (my 2nd favorite from the author), is extremely well-crafted, is heartfelt, and is full of meaningful but subtle messages. I highly recommend it.oming from the author, the message to its readers were genuine and real. It didn't seem contrived or forced, and to me, that counts a lot.

B000FVNX2Q|5.0|The HP12c Platinum 25th Anniversary Edition (HP12cPAE) is the 2006 special commemorative limited edition model and the second official upgrade of the original HP12C. The HP12c Platinum (HP12cP version 1.0) has been improved since its released in 2003. Although the HP12cPAE is based on the HP12cP version 2.0,it would has its historical place as the 4th model in the HP12C lineage since 1981 and may be unofficially designated as HP12c Platinum version 3.0.    FIRST LOOK AND FEEL. HP has showcased this upgrade with an overall quality in both the looks and feel department. The \\"new\\" retro-styling and colours of the HP12cPAE closely resembles the exterior of the silver plated HP11C, a made in the 1980s HP scientific calculator cousin of the gold HP12C. As a bonus, HP had made this a special purchase for the fans and new owners by including a nice black 25th anniversary \\"PDA\\" style leather pouch with the HP12cPAE. The overall construction is firm and solid and the improved keypad buttons has a very nice tactile feel indeed.For better viewing, users can now adjust the contrast of the clear LCD display screen.    WHAT'S NEW? Since the HP12cPAE is faithfully and conservatively built on the time-proven functionality of the HP12C, existing users should not expect to see any major hardware and software improvements. However,it is evident that HP had listened to its customers negative feedback on its first half hearted attempt to upgrade the HP12C with the slow HP12cP version 1.0 released in 2004. HP had dutifully responded to its customers negative feedback on the HP12cP v1.0 and and demostrated their wholehearted effort with the HP12cPAE by incorporating all necessary enhancements which could be possibly squeezed into the package to expand the capabilities of the classic HP12C.    HARDWARE ENHANCEMENTS. The current upgrade is 6 times faster than the HP12C as claimed and probably 10 times faster than its slow early release HP12cP when performing certain TVM calculations. The improved speed is now up to par with cheaper products from its competitors. This upgrade has four times more data storage memory which is sufficient for input of up to 80 cashflows or 400 programming steps. With the HP12cPAE, advanced users have a more powerful tool which would enable them to store more keystroke programs into their HP12cPAE, to perform routine complex and customized financial calculations by executing the programs stored in its memory.    THE HP12C NICHE. Potential new users of HP12C series of financial calculators should be aware that the proven form factor of the HP12cPAE is quite a novelty product to get used to. Despite the age of its design, if new users are looking for the unique RPN input method and user programming capability, the HP12C series and the HP17B2 series are the only choices available.    AGAINST THE COMPETITION. It is difficult to compare the user programmable HP12C series against offerings by other manufacturers, simply because no HP rivals has ever managed to produce an equivalent product to challenge the HP12C series. Advanced \\"power\\" users of financial calculators would appreciate that complex financial calculation, such as the Black-Scholes European Option Pricing Model formula could be keystroke programmed and stored into any HP12C series. HP12C, HP12cP (versions 1.0 & 2.0) and HP12cPAE users could recall the program from memory to perform routine computations repeatedly.    WHO SHOULD BUY IT? A fan of the HP12C with some spare cash on hand would probably grab a HP12cPAE off the retail shelf without thinking too hard. From my personal experience, new users to the HP12C series would find that the HP12C actually glows on you and grows with you once you are familar with it.    WOULD IT BECOME A COLLECTOR'S ITEM? Savvy consumers should know that the HP12cPAE is mass produced and sold worldwide as a mainstream consumer product. IMHO, the HP12cPAE would have to be made with real titanium, platinum or gold plated parts and engravedwith unique serial numbers if it were to qualify as a rare collector's item. Only time and actual HP sales quantity would determine if any collector-speculator would profit from an auction sale of a new and sealed HP12cPAE on e-Bay.    WOULD I RECOMMEND IT? Yes, definitely. By improving the on the HP12C, HP has again demonstrated in the HP12cPAE (and HP12cP version 2.0) that with the right effort even a good product design can be improved upon at the matured stage of its product life cycle. Now, there is a real rival for the much loved classic HP12C, and it is no other than its successor,the HP12cPAE. Realistically,it is difficult to keep improving a near perfect product such as the iconic HP12C. Judging by the high industry standard it has set, the HP12C would probably celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2031.    Thank you for reading my enduser review, hope it is useful to you.
0316017922|5.0|This was my first time reading a Malcolm Gladwell book.  I bought it on the recommendation of a friend, and had planned on reading it on vacation.  The only problem was that there was about 6 weeks between when I received the book (ahead of schedule, by the way) and when I planned to leave.  I couldn't resist, so I ended up reading the whole book in about 4 days, and must say it's a great read.  Some people have commented that Gladwell over (or sometimes under) generalizes about his material, and that he is part of a wave of \\"pop-science\\" (at least with the science-related articles) and that his writing for the New Yorker isn't substantial enough to fill out a book.  I must say that I never found myself wishing for more substance, I thought this was a good book, it brings to light many interesting ideas and thoughts.  This book also inspired me to purchase 3 more Gladwell books, and I'm working my way through them now.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Tom Petty and his Heartbreakers still have the mojo to make good music. My favorite track is \\"Jefferson Jericho Blues\\". This song has all members of the band in fine form musically. Scott Thurston sounds good playing the harmonica. Benmont Tench is equally good on the piano. Mike Campbell provides guitar riffs to get me out of my seat and get me going. \\"Candy\\" is a funny song about liking and disliking certain things like turnip greens. \\"No Reason To Cry\\" is the prettiest song on the disc.  Tom sounds so soothing vocally on this track. \\"I Should Have Known It\\" is the best pure rock track on this album.  Steve Ferrone provides a pulsating drum beat on this song. This song pumps me up. It will be good to listen to when I want to get my frustrations out. \\"U.S. 41\\" is a tribute song to all the hard working people out there. U.S. 41 is a highway that runs from Florida to upper Michigan. \\"High In The Morning\\" is a song about how quickly a person's mood can change because of alcohol. \\"Let Yourself Go\\" and \\"Taking My Time\\" are two songs that I personally like. They remind me to relax and slow down when things become too difficult. \\"Running Man's Bible\\" is a song about living life on the road. This song sounds groovy. \\"Something Good Coming\\" is a hopeful song that inspires me to stay positive in life no matter what happens.  I love this new album.
0802798225|5.0|Synopsis: Alex Fuentes is a gang member from the South on the outskirts of Chicago. Brittany Ellis is a privileged and popular girl from the north, who seems to have it all. They are total opposites who will never get along. When they are forced to be lab partners in their chemistry class, \\"the results are bound to be explosive.\\" With stereotypes, impressions, and misconceptions about each other comes a lot of expectations -- hate, pranks, arguments, among many others. But what happens is one that they least expected; they fall in love. Can they break through the boundaries and the walls that separate them both?<br /><br />Review: This is West Side Story and Romeo and Juliet combined in a Young Adult novel. Bad boy and Miss Popular starts off hating each other's guts, and ends up falling in love. Sounds stereotypical? Overdone? Not one bit. Simone Elkeles takes a seemingly \\"overdone\\" premise, and adds a new and modern twist to it.<br /><br />I'm going to have to confess, I'm a bit of a sucker for love stories, and when they're well-told, it makes me love them even more. The story of Alex Fuentes and Brittany Ellis is just what I was looking for. Yes, I loved Perfect Chemistry! In fact, I loved it so much I was able to read this in just one sitting.<br />While this is mainly about their romance, it doesn't entirely dominate the story. There are other important themes covered as well. However, the truth is, the best parts about this book are the romance itself and the two main characters. I love them! They were very realistic and believable, and I was able to empathize with them as if they were my own friends. It's one thing to read about characters, but it's another when you are able to actually care about them.<br /><br />Sure, there were a few cliche lines here and there -- including the epilogue, even though I still liked it haha. I also don't know if I would be able to call this book \\"amazing\\" (define amazing anyway!?) but honestly? I don't really care. It was still good. At the end of the day, I was entertained. I cared about the characters and their story. Sometimes that's all you really want in a book. So as not to make this review any longer, I'm just going to say that I fell in love with Alex and Brittany. Period. If you love YA, I highly recommend this one. 5 stars, most definitely!day, I was entertained. I cared about the characters and their story. Sometimes that's all you really want in a book.

B0000064TT|5.0|If you already own this wonderful album and are contemplating purchasing the remaster, I think you'll be glad if you do. I became aware of the Dixie Dregs late---in the 1990s, after the heyday of vinyl, and have listened to nothing but the anemic original CD release for the last two decades. Although I could appreciate the amazing virtuosity of the musicians and the excellent caliber of the writing, the sound of the disc left much to be desired, sounding thin and distant. The remaster brings body to the uninspiring sound of the older CD, giving a rounder, fuller, more immediate impact to the superlative tunes contained on this disc, perhaps the Dixie Dregs' best effort. The price is right and the sound is (finally) up to the high level of the performances.
B001JFZ118|1.0|My issue is not with the movie. Apparently you can only have a dvd copy there are not digital downloads available for this. So i ordered the video wanting to watch it. It took over 14 days to get the movie. I actually ended going to Hastings and buying because it was taking so long. I couldn't cancel the order, I had to wait for it to be delivered, then they want to charge about half of what movie costs to send it back so i kept it. I have ordered many things from Amazon, and have been happy with service from their vendors. I have not been happy with things ordered from Amazon itself. It takes them way to long to ship and deliver their merchandise.
0060512806|5.0|As a non-computer geek type, and a woman to boot, I loved the book.  I wasn't disturbed by the lack of women characters.  After all, the book was about a bunch of guys and what these guys thought.  And these guys actually thought pretty highly of women.  That's one thing I liked about the book. The characters themselves liked all different kinds of people, rarely making judgments based on appearances.  I also liked the digressive nature of the book and the oblique manner of moving the plot forward.  This is definitely not a book to read in a hurry over a summer trip.  And, I was often surprised by what the characters did or thought.  So often, novels are rather predictable with predictable outcomes and characters.  This book is originality cubed.As a non-computer geek type, and a woman to boot, I loved the book.  I wasn't disturbed by the lack of women characters.

B003H8WSLQ|5.0|\\"Blue blood\\" opens Foals new CD and you'd be forgiven for thinking you were listening to Vampire Weekend. The song is groovy Bass- heavy Rock with trilling soukous guitar. Produced this time around by Luke Smith (formerly from Alt Rock band Clor, their debut was produced by TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek), where \\"Antidotes\\" was a more electronic Dance/Rock affair, \\"Total life forever\\" is groovier with a loose feel.<br /><br />\\"Miami' finds lead singer Yannis Philippakis sounding all Robert Smith-like on a catchy midtempo groove. The Dancey title track with chanted vocals sounds like Foals of yore.  The stomping \\"Black gold\\" features choppy riffs and haunting harmonies with a euphoric climax. \\"The future is not what it used to be\\" sings Philippakis in a new found croon.<br /><br />It's tough to pick a standout really, the almost 7 minute-long epic ballad \\"Spanish sahara\\" (with a slow building intro, increasing in tension before exploding into life towards the end), the frantic \\"This Orient\\" (with dizzying guitars), the piano interlude \\"Fugue\\", \\"After glow\\" (starts off as a ballad, leading to stomping Disco-tinged climax), the falsetto sung \\"Alabaster\\" (which starts off elegiac, building to a ballad with crunching/fuzzy beats), \\"2 trees\\" (with a floaty feel), and closing atmospheric ballad \\"What remains\\", everything thrills.<br /><br />As good as their debut was, this is even more ambitious and wide screen. A wonderful head trip!

0312323867|4.0|This was such a great book. Just like Something Borrowed, I couldn't put the book down and had to finish it in one day. I didn't expect to like the book because of my dislike for Darcy, but that changed about 1/4th of the way into the book. Giffin does a marvelous job of building the characters in her books to be so lovable and deep. Now I absolutely love Darcy. This was such an emotional book for me, I even cried 'happy tears'! Another must read from Giffin!
0375842209|5.0|I think others have stolen my words.    Yes, all of the above. Amazing choice of scenario, original choice of narrator, whole heart choice of characters. All I can add is: is very rare that I cry with a book, I cry all the times with movies, but books usually take a lot to make you cry, to transmit the emotions. Zusak is a genius. I loved the book thief and I recommend it a million times, along \\"I am the messenger\\". I am with \\"Fighting Ruben Wolfe\\" I LOVE THIS WRITER.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Im a proud member of the United States Army. I love fitness and working out. I've never been one to be a workout video type of gals. This DVD is excellent. At first I figured pshhh this'll be cake. Not so my friend. I was dripping in sweat before I even got within 10min of the 20min video! I love how each workout pushes you to do a little more! Everytime I felt like giving up, I thought, \\"If someone 300+lbs can do this, well so the hell can I\\"    Each level got more challenging, but I found myself looking forward to the new increase after every 10 days. Each level does get more challenging, but remember you are growing stronger every day that you are shredding! Believe it or not, my favorite level is #3. Know what my favorite move is..walking pushups!! I know, lol I'm a crazy woman!    I definately recommend this DVD to anyone looking to workout. Whether you're a novice or love fitness it will push you! Eventhough it's only 20min do not for a second think that you won't be working every minute of that time! Push yourself and you will be amazed at what you can accomplish!    Hooah,  PFC Cinammon
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Martin Scorsese has given us a film depiction of the inglorious book written by Dennis Lehane. The book was an abrupt turn from the kind of books Lehane had written. The book was a best seller and this film should be right there up with the novel.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an exquisite performance as the Federal Marshall who comes to Shutter Island to solve the mystery of a lost woman patient. Shutter Island is an Insane Asylum for the Criminally Insane, and quite an island it is. Off the coast of Boston Harbor this island is one of your worst nightmares. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner, played by Mark Ruffalo, team up together to solve the mystery. But, what they find is a series of mysteries upon mysteries, and the more they<br />look, the more bizarre the situation becomes. Bit by bit Teddy becomes more involved and caught up in the nightmare of the treatments that are occurring on this island. The anxiety that becomes Teddy becomes our anxiety and the old Nazi captains and the stories of children drowning become more real. Take a ride with Teddy in this insane, mad world. What you will discover is so antithetical to anything you ever believed possible. This is a glorious tale, told with the majesty of Martin Scorsese. The  soundtrack from Robbie Robertson is ominous and stunning.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 06-15-10<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001N44BVQ Body of Lies (Widescreen Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:6305941122 A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies]]

B00278U1W0|5.0|Imagine that Blind Faith had continued.  This DVD gives you some idea of what might have been.  No real surprises but a solid satisfying performance that really gets you thinking what they might have been able to do at the height of their powers.  I do not understand the complaint about SW's guitar playing which I quite enjoyed. The musicianship is all around excellent.     While I did notice an occassional sync issue I have no problems with the audio although I opted for stereo rather than 5.1 on the audio selection.   The hi def video is generally pretty good if not particularly creative.     While I agree that the song selection is not particularly inspired, keep in mind that there is a lot of music here to chose from.  This is a two disc CD set.    A worthwhile addition to the collection.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I believe the script writers did a very good job of capturing the characters in the book.  They shortened the early events of the book, and slightly altered the ending sequence of events, but I do not believe anything was lost.  By shortening the beginning, the movie glosses over her deep attachment to her home.  It also cuts out the explanation of Margaret's relationship to her parents and Mr.&Mrs. Hale's relationship with each other.  (Most of the explanation is from thoughts in Margaret's head, so I'm not sure how the writers could portray it.)  The actors do a good job of acting out these relationships later in the movie, so again I don't believe anything was lost.  The middle of the book and movie are very similar.  The movie ends the same as the book, with a different location for the scenes.  I actually preferred the scene location for the movie over the book.  If you like the book, you'll enjoy this movie.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I will keep this short because quite frankly this this move speaks for it's self.  If you are reading this and you have already seen it, you know what I am talking about.  If you haven't... what are you waiting for!?! Stop reading this review and go buy it!  This special edition comes with a bunch of extras that make it even more worthwhile.<br /><br />Created by Joss Whedon the incredible mind that brought the world \\"Buffy the Vampire slayer\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"Dollhouse\\" and the highly underrated \\"Firefly\\" which led to the creation of this amazing film.  If you haven't seen Serenity yet I would recommend seeing the series first, you do not have to but you will grow to love the characters more first and care more about them.<br /><br />An amazing, creative, imaginative work of art.  It is a science fiction, action, horror, martial arts, comedy western.  Even if you don't love it as much as I do, if you are a film buff you should own this movie.
B003C1QIO6|4.0|Diehards of Tropical Pop music can never get enough of a good thing.  That's why people will line up for miles to see Jimmy Buffet.  He's made a whole career out of \\"Margaritaville,\\" and any elaboration has brought the faithful, clad in Jamaican shorts and comfy shirts, to lean back, relax, and sit in the sun.  Everyone from Kenny Chesney ('No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem') and actor Matthew McConaughey hang out at the beach for their own benefit and for the fans who want to let it all hang loose.  Now there are two ways to work this out:  One is to coast on one's laurels (which really does fits the bill) or reinvent the wheel at some point.  Jack Johnson, who admirably has personified Donovan's \\"Mellow Yellow\\" like none other in recent memory, brings perhaps his most varied and festive luau to date.  As one of the biggest selling singer-songwriters of the past decade, he's decided for the latter, adding electric guitar and piano accompaniment to refurbish his admirable penchant to strum out acoustical licks with sentiments of domestic bliss and utopian wishes without stressing out his laid-back Hawaiian surfer dude sensibilities.  While even the 'Curious George' soundtrack was to the point, endearing, and reached a destination lyrically, his former work seems sketchy in comparison to his latest C.D., 'To the Sea.'    The starter \\"You and Your Heart,\\" the title track, and \\"From the Clouds\\" bring it all back home admirably, but the acoustical \\"My Little Girl,\\" the intricate folk tune \\"Turn Your Love,\\" and the bluesy \\"Red Wine, Mistakes, and Mythology\\" give a more kaleidoscopic musical vision, preventing a rut for the Hawaii-in-the-hammock backdrop of his music.  For the latter, one can't help but think of the kind of accompaniment the Beatles had on \\"Hey Bulldog,\\" without any complaints of copyright infringement.  \\"No Good with Faces\\" and \\"The Upsetter\\" are familiar Johnson, but even these allegedly lesser tracks have a new flair with smooth harmonies (or a double-tracked voice) and smoother licks and new instruments.  (Is that a harmonica I hear on \\"No Good with Faces\\" and \\"At or with Me\\"?)  Perhaps even more than 'In Between Dreams,' Jack has found the right groove and given all casual and faithful fans a reason to tune in once again.  'To the Sea' realizes these promises and shuffles the musical deck of Johnson's already rewarding music catalog.
0684853523|4.0|Stephen King's [[ASIN:0743455967 On Writing]] preaches the value of hard work as the foundation to good writing. With a steady dose of encouragement, he challenges writers of all levels to employ discipline as the key to developing one's craft. He also affirms his disdain of the passive voice and sings the praises of standard writing volumes like Strunk and White's [[ASIN:0205632645 The Elements of Style: 50th Anniversary Edition]] and William Zinsser's [[ASIN:0060891548 On Writing Well, 30th Anniversary Edition: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction]].<br /><br />If you skip the first 100 pages and head straight to the \\"Tools\\" section of the book, you will find distilled guidance on writing fiction. With the exception of his advice to just let the plot happen (something only idiots or geniuses like King should attempt), the book offers useful principles anyone can use. For example:<br /><br />* \\"If you don't have time to read, you don't have time (or the tools) to write.\\"<br />* \\"Until you get [a place of your own to write] you'll find your new resolution to write a lot hard to take seriously.\\"<br />* Set a daily writing goal and don't quit until it's done.<br />* Write what you know, but use imagination.<br />* Describe what you see, but then get back to the story.<br />* Never tell the reader a thing if you can show it.<br />* Good dialogue comes from listening to real people talk--and to how they talk.<br /><br />The book would get five stars if not for a couple of gripes. King used the first 100 pages to recount his life story and--in justification for doing so--his development as a writer. Granted, the memoir offers occasional kernels of wisdom on the craft of writing. But for the most part, the story of King's life betrays the fact that successful horror novelists have little opportunity to publish an autobiography. (So squeeze it in wherever you can.) Also, a writer as gifted as King doesn't NEED to use profanity to make me laugh (that's too easy). But you write what you know.<br /><br />In short, if you don't mind spitting out a few bones, \\"On Writing\\" has some great stuff to chew on.you don't mind spitting out a few bones, \\"On Writing\\" has some great stuff to chew on.
1441412840|1.0|Religious propaganda!  Not the psychological enlightenment I thought I was getting.  As an atheist, I found this book to unhelpful and down right irritating.  I did not receive a scientific book about the brain and it's workings.  The book is an advertisement for Christianity and nothing more.  I prefer not having religion shoved at me needlessly.  It will do nothing to sway my mind.  Save yourself the money and do not purchase this book.  The author has made way more than he should have off of this piece of propaganda trash.
B00006DEFA|5.0|...this film is amazing for many reasons: the music, F. Murray Abraham's (Antonio Salieri's) acting and the art of its costumes, architecture and color coordination... this version includes several scenes that were omitted from its original release (could see why some were originally deleted however, but this is simply a matter of taste and I'm sure some may find that those deleted scenes explain certain things that might not have been completely clear in its original version)... overall this film is wonderful.
0446581348|5.0|I am a firm believer that EVERY woman that wears makeup needs this book. I have recommended it to all my family members and close friends.  Bobbi Brown writes cleanly and gives tips and easy to follow instructions (along with pictures) that really can help anyone from those shy of makeup to aspiring makeup artists.  This book is well organized and a perfect book for those that want to learn the basics or improve their makeup application techniques.
B00081U7HC|5.0|I have to live vicariously through tall, slim, pretty women like Julia. This movie always makes me smile.
B002ZG994U|5.0|I'll admit it, I was never a big fan of the original show. If I remember correctly, they made the point of never killing anybody, so they were forced to live by the merits of crazy plans, and the baddie-of-the-week. Needless to say, unless you were a fan of it as a kid, you don't really have fond memories of the show, and you wouldn't think it'd make a good film, however, under the direction of Joe Carnahan, the concept is taken to its logical extreme, and along the way, awesomeness is given.<br /><br />First off, the casting. Liam Neeson is a myth unto himself now, and the movie plays off of this perfectly. He's a crazy leader, kicking butt, taking names, and making plans. Plus, he just radiates awesomeness. Bradley Cooper is the handsome leading-man type, and that's his character. Granted, by the end of the film he does learn to become a planner, but he's mostly there to look good and crack wise, and I'm fine with that because Cooper does it well. Then there's Rampage Jackson. Since he probably had the hardest role in filling the shoes of a legend, he does pretty well with it. His acting skills are a bit iffy, but he's completely serviceable, he's good for the butt of a joke, and he can kick butt pretty well also. Finally, there's Sharlto Copley, who you may know from District 9. That happened to be his first ever movie role, and he played a largely dramatic part. In his 2nd movie role, he's there for the crazy and the funny. How do I know this? When spinning chopper blades, he sings \\"You spin me right round baby, like a record baby, right round.\\" That's funny and crazy right? Of course it is! The only problem I had with his character though is his accent. Sometimes he sounds like his native South African, sometimes he sounds Southern. But hey, I still love him. Finally, there's Patrick Wilson as a slimy CIA agent. I had not really seen the guy in anything before this movie, but he is such a good actor, and he seems to be having a lot of fun in relishing the ridiculous role. Trust me, there's a scene with Patrick Wilson in an SUV that's just so brilliant on his part.<br /><br />Next up, plot. This aspect is beside the point mostly, but it's still pretty decent in its own right. You'll have a hard time keeping up with its various \\"twists and turns,\\" but you'll get the gist of what's happening, and that's what's really important, since it just serves to take you from setpiece to setpiece. Also, this plot does have holes, so don't be surprised if you get Swiss Cheese instead of Cheddar.<br /><br />Finally, the action. This is really the whole point of the movie, and on this aspect, it really delivers. It's original, it's engaging, it's fun, and it's awesome. Among the highlights? The classic scene of the A-Team \\"flying\\" a tank, and a cargo ship blowing to smithereens, and it's CGI cargo reigning down. I mean, when the whole point of your movie is to get to the action, you have to deliver, and this movie does just that, and then some.<br /><br />Overall, Stuff blows up. Comedic lines are given. The characters are great. The movie is consistently entertaining. What more do you need? It's like the most recent revival of Star Trek in a way. A tired series is given new life with a great cast that adds their own personality to classic characters, action to be had & a plot to accommodate it all. It may not be the great overall film like Star Trek is, but it knows what it does, and it does it well. And really, that's all I can ask from for a movie like this. I, at least, ate it up.<br /><br />Real Score: 4.5/5le. Trust me, there's a scene with Patrick Wilson in an SUV that's just so brilliant on his part.    Next up, plot.

B003IMER2E|5.0|This is an excellent album as I had expected. Two exceptional artistes coming together to produce an album of high lyrical and musical quality. Subject matter was never lacking, even in the fun tracks like \\"Nah Mean\\" and \\"As We Enter\\". This long awaited fusion was well executed and breathed new life into both the Hop Hop and Reggae genres. The two artistes and by extension, genres, complimented each other and the guest artistes added an extra twist to the overall flavor. This is the best album I've heard in a long time. Big ups to all who were involved :)
0385341008|5.0|I finished this book for our book club meeting over two months ago - I still find myself going back to the characters and wishing I could read more.  Definitely a great read and something I recommend.  A beach book, a relaxing book and a book to smile about.  The structure and the writing create the perfect storm of a story that pulls you in so that you feel like you're there just watching it all happen in front of you.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Others have covered this book well, I will just add my endorsement as a reader of classic SF. This novel reads like one from the golden age of sf, it flows well and has original ideas in a familiar style which is much too rare these days. Try it and enjoy.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|The re-mastered EOMS is very well done. The sound quality is so much better than the LP I purchased 38 years ago. It was also 38 years ago this month that I saw the band live (four concerts-two dayz)@ Winterland, San Francisco. All the Stones albums are excellent and unique in their own way. However, Exile on Main Street shows the band going to the next level with non-stop rock, country, blues AND a tres' cool horn section. AND, ten new tracks!    BUY IT!
0345403959|4.0|I loved the Belgariad and Mallorean so naturally this book is one worth reading. This lays the groundwork for everything set in motion during the two noted series. There are some cyclical ideas in the story telling, but I find this to enjoyable since most of life is cyclical. Since this book is essentially a historical account in the series, it makes sense that it has some repetitions, after all human history is repetitive. The best thing about this book was the foundation Eddings orchestrated for the premise of the Belgariad. It was very exciting and pleasurable to read about the beginning of the spiritual mythos that Eddings created in this realm. Learning about the gods involvements with human prior to the cracking of the world was very fun and worth reading. Also, the development of the Belgarath and Polgara characters lends itself to further enjoyment of the Belgariad and Malloeran series'.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Wow.  Someone's actually managed to make an original vampire movie.  I'm not a big fan of vampire stories, I've just seen it too many times.  But this as good as it gets.  Beautifully shot (and great looking on blu-ray), moody, mysterious, emotional.  This is as much a pre-adolescent love story, as anything.<br /><br />An outsider boy, fragile, picked on, and harboring violent fantasies of revenge is befriended by a strange, pale young girl who doesn't<br />seem to feel the Swedish cold.<br /><br />It's a strange and fascinating mix of tones; bloody, gory killings, very sweet, well acted pre-teen romance, and occasional black comedy.  There's also an interesting, complex morality here.  Both our young heroes have deeply violent, sadistic streaks within them.  Yet we root for them, even though some off her victims are truly innocent, and he collects stories about murder like a nascent serial killer.  It grew even deeper emotionally on 2nd viewing.<br /><br />One note re the subtitle controversy - the UK blu-ray has the correct subtitles, and plays just fine on US machines.  At least it did on mine.
B000063DGC|5.0|There have been a ton of great rock guitar players throughout the last 50 years, but none have had more of an impact on me than Randy Rhoads. His complex riffs and mesmerizing guitar solos got me to pick up the guitar in the first place. The skill level he possessed at such a young age is mind blowing. His sound is like what you would hear if Eddie Van Halen and Yngwie Malmsteen's guitars mated and had a baby. More importantly, as fast as he could play, he never sacrificed melody. Some of the most beautiful guitar solos of all time can be found on his only two albums with Ozzy Osbourne. Sadly, this guy was just getting started when he died at the age of 25.<br /><br />If you thought Blizzard of Oz and Diary of a Madman showcased his talents, you haven't heard nothing yet. This live CD fully unleashed his abilites that could no longer be contained. His solos are longer, often superior to the studio recordings, and he even makes a few Black Sabbath songs sound a heck of a lot better.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the band around him is also great and Ozzy's vocals are very solid. The track list is a good mix of solo Ozzy's first two albums and some Sabbath tunes. The only thing is, the audio quality is remastered, but it still isn't that clear. It does give it a somewhat raw sound, which is expected for something recorded back in 1981. Overall, Tribute remains one of my favorite CDs that I have ever owned.<br /><br />Ozzy has had a number of great guitar players (Tony Iommi, Zakk Wylde, etc.) from Black Sabbath through his long solo career, but none have captured that two year span of magic called the Randy Rhoads era.

0345337581|5.0|I have always had major problems remembering names, places and things in general really.  So when it was recommended by a great mentor of mine as a 'must have' book, I thought \\"Why not\\".    From the very beginning when they show you how to 'remember' things, it's been WOW.  It actually makes sense when you think about it - the process that is.  The 'this is how you remember things' process.  AND it's easy once you get into it.  All you have to do is have a crazy, wild and way-out imagination to help you to remember.    I would recommend this to parents who want to help their children to remember spelling words, things, lists, anything.  It would make such a difference in their school lives.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is anyone who wants to expand their knowledge in any area in their life.    Great book - great fun learning.
0691142165|4.0|Under ordinary circumstances, \\"This Time Is Different\\" would be of interest primarily to professional economists and students - but given the timing of its publication, smack dab in the middle of a financial crisis, the book has caught on with a wider audience.<br /><br />Go to a forum about the recent (or current?) financial crisis, and someone will probably brandish a copy in the air as though to say, \\"I read it.\\"  And at a May 26, 2010 meeting of the Fiscal Commission, which has been charged with proposing fixes to the nation's fiscal woes after the November elections, testimony of Professor Reinhart plus her responses to questions took up a goodly share of the 2-1/2 hour televised session.  Ergo, people who are more interested in policy issues than in quantitative economic data may want to read the book just to be \\"in the know.\\"<br /><br />In my case, the clincher was a personal recommendation from a friend who used to play chess with Professor Rogoff (but never managed to beat him).<br /><br />The basic thrust is to summarize and draw conclusions about financial crises from reams of historical data - a very different tack from Niall Ferguson's qualitative survey in \\"The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World,\\" Penguin Press (2008).  (Ferguson praises \\"This Time Is Different\\" in a jacket blurb, by the way, as making \\"a truly heroic contribution to financial history.\\") Be prepared for dozens of tables (data), figures (graphs), and boxes (sidebars), plus discussion thereof in the text - delivered without a lot of ideological baggage (which right away distinguishes this book from most of what has been written about the financial crisis).  Such an approach lends credibility to the central theme, which must be articulated 100 times, that private and public policy makers are prone to forget the lessons of the past and take risks that will eventually backfire based on the assumption that they are smarter or luckier than their predecessors.<br /><br />For readers who would dispense with the historical background and get right to the present day situation, the authors suggest the option of starting with Part V, \\"The U.S. Subprime Meltdown and the Second Great Contraction.\\"  I elected not to do this, reading the book from start to finish, but did skip over some of the tables and figures.<br /><br />Here are some takeaways from the book, which are amply supported by the data presented:<br /><br />1. The basic cause of financial crises is debt, taken on in good times, which cannot be supported when reverses occur and/or lenders lose confidence.  Sometimes the debt is issued by banks and other private firms (banking crisis), sometimes the debt is issued by governments (sovereign debt crisis), and not infrequently the second type of crisis follows the first.<br /><br />2. Banking crises have been experienced over the years by developing and developed countries alike, but until recently it was thought that developed countries had graduated from sovereign debt crises.  It now appears that this conclusion may be wrong.<br /><br />3. The so-called \\"Second Great Contraction\\" is the first global financial crisis of the post-World War II era.  It is necessary to go back to the Great Depression in the 1930s to find an economic crisis of comparable size and scope.  Nevertheless, striking parallels exist between the current situation and lesser country or regional financial crises of the past 60+ years. Notably, the postwar data show that a banking crisis typically results in a big run-up (86% on average) in government debt over the next three years.  (See Figure 10.10, page 170.) No wonder that a sovereign debt crisis often follows a banking crisis, and may yet do so in the current situation.<br /><br />4. Another important insight is a greater role for domestically held debt in government debt crises than had generally been assumed.  Other analysts may have gone astray, apparently, because domestic debt data are harder to come by formany countries than external debt data.  Factoring in domestic debt helps to explain why so many countries have experienced debt crises at what appeared to be manageable debt levels.  Typically, governments are more reluctant to renege on domestic than external debt, for which reason debt crises involving domestic debt tend to be more pronounced and of longer duration.<br /><br />However, the data do not resolve the policy questions - they simply establish that the answers are important.<br /><br />A. As for whether the U.S. government should pull in its fiscal horns or continue trying to stimulate the economy in hopes of promoting a hopefully rapid recovery, the authors say (page 290) \\"the surge in government debt following a crisis is an important factor to weigh when considering how far governments should be willing to go to offset the adverse consequences of the crisis on economic activity.\\"  Well, that certainly settles the question!<br /><br />B. Can future financial crises be avoided, and if so how?  The suggested answers boil down to demanding better data (Moody's ratings, etc., are ranked at the bottom of the spectrum), empowering some sort of international financial institution to ride herd on profligate national governments, and a lot more humility.

0312360258|1.0|I have been avoiding the House of Night books for a long time. I always pick them up when I'm waiting in the checkout line at places like TJ Max and Target, but for some reason something (probably the cheesy jacket copy, or maybe memories of some really atrocious Amazon reviews on these books that I've come across) always holds me back from purchasing. I happened to come across a copy at my local library the other day, however, and finally decided to take the plunge.<br /><br />And now I feel justified in having resisted for so long.<br /><br />I'll start with the one good thing I can say about this book, the first in the House of Night Series (and the last that I will be reading): the myth is interesting and unique. I'm not talking about the concept of a vampire finishing school (sorry, I refuse to type out \\"vampyre.\\" Presumably the authors thought this bizarre spelling might give the book a sort of mysterious, medieval-ish edge, but actually it just looks ridiculous, especially when words like \\"poopie\\" and \\"ohmygod!\\" pop up continually on the same page as \\"vampyre\\"). Sorry...back to the topic. Yes, the vampire myth presented in this book is a unique one; I liked the idea of the Amazons being ancient vampires, of the matriarchal society, the goddess Nyx, all that. It's a creative idea and had a lot of potential.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the allure of the myth was completely overshadowed by the absurd and grating vocab. I realize that as a 24 yr old, it's been a little while since I was in high school, but I have a hard time imagining that the vernacular has changed so much since my teenage years that words like \\"jeesh,\\" \\"poopie,\\" and \\"hell! hell! hell!\\" are now making their way into nearly every sentence a teenager utters. I get that PC Cast is a bit removed from the generation she's writing about, and is trying very hard to make her characters sound their age...but for me, the language seems totally forced, unnatural, and dumb. I really couldn't get past it.<br /><br />Another serious stumbling block for me was the main character and narrator, Zoey. When the book begins, Zoey is dating the high school football captain--yet she continually refers to cheerleader type girls as \\"barbies\\" and makes fun of people for dyeing their hair blond. It doesn't really make sense; usually the football quarterback's girlfriend wouldn't be so surprised and put off by these types of things...even if she chooses to resist them herself. Additionally, from almost the beginning of the book, we're given the impression that Zoey is \\"special\\" - even among vampires, she is somehow superior. For me, this seemed more like \\"telling\\" than \\"showing\\" on the part of the author. Zoey just didn't really have any character traits that seemed all that remarkable. She never really felt like a real person to me. Maybe she is developed more in the next books...I guess I'll never know.<br /><br />The final and perhaps most severe problem I had with the book is that it was extremely boring. Solidly half the book takes place during one day of classes at the House of Night, during which there is absolutely no action. We see Zoey go to drama class, English literature class, fencing class, etc. It's like the beginning of a Harry Potter book, minus the characters we love (or love to hate), the unbelievable creativity, and the exciting feeling that something major is about to happen.<br /><br />To be honest: I made it 2/3 of the way through this, and then skipped to the last chapter. The end was unsurprising, and did not leave me breathless (or even vaguely interested) to find what might happen next.block for me was the main character and narrator, Zoey.

0307454541|1.0|I really don't understand why this book has become such a success. It's dreadfully slow. Page after page containing nothing except what he ate, what chair he sat in, then he moved to sit in another chair, the name of his computer, what book he read before falling asleep. Yawn. And when the plot finally took off (after 300 pages) I realized I was reading a book about disgusting sexual brutality. Too violent. Had to skim large parts that turned my stomach. I've heard that the movie is also disgustingly violent. I also had a hard time with the clunky writing style, probably due to the translation. A lot of my joy in reading comes from the beautiful and/or clever use of words, which this novel completely lacks due to the translation. Skip it.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|LOST has been an amazing ride. Never has a show sucked me in quite like Lost. From the opening episode I knew I was hooked and I never looked back. It has the best writers on the planet and they constantly keep you on your toes as you fall in love with this strange world. I can't even start to explain the amount of depth that this show is made up of. Every episode is important as it adds something new to the mythos of the series and to the characters themselves. At its core Lost is all about it's characters. Seldom does the plot get more spotlight then the characters themselves. This leads to some amazing characters that feel like real life human beings instead of fictional creations. They are all given a fair share of the spotlight through flashbacks that tell their story before the island.     Lost was never a show afraid to take risks. None of the characters were ever safe and Lost took no prisoners as main cast members meet the grave with some regularity throughout the series. It also never became stale as the actual narration theme changed every season which kept the series fresh and new every week. I won't elaborate on how the theme changed, but let's just say that every season had a unique focus. The actors all should receive a lot of praise as there is never a moment where they fail to utterly shock you with their brilliance. After all the writing would be nothing without great actors to bring these characters to life, and bring them to life they did.     LOST was not always perfect though. No series is as season five was a rare point where the characters were thrust into the background as the plot itself set the pace. Lost was always best when it told its story through it's characters. The rest of the series is amazing though. Even season five where it is disappointing it still finds ways to impress you with some stellar episodes mixed in.     Lost constantly referenced previous episodes, which I loved. You felt really rewarded for seeing a connection thatyour family or friends didn't recognize. Also there are a lot of literary referenced throughout the series along with philosophy, mythology and history. It really has a deep framework that it built its story on.     The main argument to the series is the most interesting part of the show. The old science vs religion is a major theme to the series. The main character Jack is a man of science. While another character Locke is a man of faith that believes everything happens for a reason. Seeing these two men argue both points throughout the series is always top notch entertainment. All of the characters evolve greatly from the person they were in the pilot to who they are in the end, but these two have the greatest arcs as both men change to understand each others point in different ways.     Now without giving anything away the series finale was brilliant. Never has a finale finished off a series so perfectly. Yes some of the answers are left to ponder, but that is one thing that makes Lost great. You have to use your brain in order to figure out some of the lesser mysteries, but I assure you there are clues to be found to figure them out. We simply haven't noticed them yet. Lost is a series that has a lot of replay value as you constantly catch pieces of the puzzle that you missed before, and with plots and characters this detailed you won't mind re-watching the series for decades to come.     If you've never seen the series or are just buying it to relive the greatest series of all time I highly recommend the series to fans of serialized dramas. I envy all of you new comers to Lost as you are at the beginning of the adventure. I wish I could relive it for the first time again as it is sorely missed in my life. For the rest of us that have taken the journey already we have to use this set to remember and to let go.    Update: I now have the set and I am blown away. The video quality is amazing and well worth the extra money for the blu ray. The packaging is also cooland filled with secrets of its own. The bonus features look immense and I will update you on the complete running time of the whole set.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|It seems like a well made watch, which seiko is known for. Some reviewers said that they didn't care for the crystal on the back of the watch because it was superfilous. I like it myself. I think it's kind of neat to see how things work. I like the way the date is set. You pull the stem out to the first click and you turn it one way to change the date and the other way to change the day. That way you don't have to turn it through 30 days to get where you want. I also like the fact that it isn't huge. Also the stem is at 4 o'clock and it protrudes very little, by having it that way it doesn't dig into your wrist. A good idea. I am old enought to remember when Timex came out with the first affordable selfwinding watch and loved it. The other good thing is that if you get stuck on a deserted island with no stores you don't have to worry about buying batteries. All in all it seems to be a good watch and has a 3 year garentee.
B003PWJS9Y|5.0|No matter what anyone else says, being in the music industry, I feel they have always had a small circle of formation, musically.  In other words, they haven't had a wide range of genre's added to their catalog.  They are simply Synthpop, New Wave, and Synthrock.  If you look at wikipedia, and other good sources of the band's music, you don't commonly see \\"Rock\\" as their main genre.  A lot of people think because you hear a guitar, it's \\"Rock\\", but that is not necessarily the case.      Overall, this is pure New Wave with a very modern flair.  It brings us back to the 70's, 80's and 90's, but with an up-to-date sound.  My favorite Devo album will always be 'Oh No! It's Devo\\", but this is running a close second.  I was amazed, too, on how smooth the production is on 'Something For Everybody'.  Not to bring up an age factor, but for their ages and what they've been through in the last 30 years, they sound just as good as they did back in the 80's, vocally.      If you are a Devo-ted to Devo, then I highly suggest purchasing this wild, fun and danceable CD.
B00127RAJY|4.0|As a yo-yo workout person about 20 lbs overweight, this was a difficult, but good workout.  I only did it for five days straight, though, and haven't had the stamina to do the full 30 days.  I hope to get back on the wagon soon.  I will say you can definitely feel it working - I was sore the first day!  It didn't even take a full 24 hours like it normally does to feel sore muscles.  Good luck!
B00005ASOI|3.0|I liked the movie compared to later(demons), I think it was more scarier and the music was eerily good. the movie isn't great,but it's better than the later work in my opinion.I could go without the most violent parts,I think besides that and the premise,the movie is good and the acting ain't bad and dubbing ain't so bad either.
B001CLG6RC|5.0|I am an avid Enigma fan and absolutely love this album.  It does take two or three times to get used to the mixes of different types of sounds and lyrics but i listen to this album almost everyday.  If you like Enigma I will be surprised if you do not LOVE this album.  I await new ones since I own ALL of there albums!
B0002XVQNU|4.0|Superhero movies have become one of the highest-grossing genres in the moviemaking business and for good reason.  They provide fantastic escapism and bring the fantasies from the pages of comics to life.  One such film was the 2003 adaptation of Marvel Comic's character Daredevil.<br /><br />Now, I'm sure I'll take some heat for this from fans of the comic, but I've never really enjoyed the Daredevil comics all that much; a red-horned wearing Stan Lee/Marvel rebuttal to DC's Batman.  This kept me from being interested in the comics, but I always enjoy a good superhero movie so I gave the film adaptation of Daredevil a shot.  Like many, I found the product disappointing...but then I discovered there was a Director's cut many claimed to be drastically different from the theatrical release I had witnessed...<br /><br />That is correct.  The Director's Cut is indeed a whole other film that stands on its own as an engaging superhero flick.  I'll just have to summarize both versions without giving away too much- just so you can understand the differences.<br /><br />Theatrical Cut: 2.5/5 Stars<br /><br />This is the version of the film most people have probably seen and found to be severely disapointing.  It clearly tries to follow up Spider-Man with wall-to-wall special effect fights with gravity defying, Matrix-influenced fights.  The only real highlight is Colin Farrell as assassin Bullseye, whose over-the-top antics and remorseless killing make for quite a show.  Matt Murdock's (Daredevil) daytime career as a lawyer who stands for the little-man is totally glossed over in order to increase the action percentage and the Kingpin (played outstandingly by Michael Clarke Duncan) is so underdeveloped and unintimidating that he seems more like a glorified CEO than a prominent crime lord.<br /><br />In its theatrical format Daredevil is a fairly typical superhero movie.  Wall to wall fantasy action with minor character development, but little soul; only good thing to be found here is the soundtrack which features some contemporary songs and a stylish directing style.<br /><br />Director's cut: 4/5 Stars<br /><br />Most of the flaws of the theatrical cut are resolved in this grittier version of the film.  This isn't one of those director's cuts like Alien Vs. Predator where they splatter some CGI blood but the final result still blows chunks.  No, this Director's Cut truly is an alternate cut that bears only a vague resemblance to the theatrical cut.<br /><br />Allow me to list some reasons why this cut is vastly superior to the edition many of you saw in theaters back in '03.<br /><br />1. Character development:  Matt Murdock is developed as a character and a lawyer instead of being simply the man in the red costume.  He is a conflicted individual who doesn't quite know yet what he wants to be; only that he wants to take down crime in whatever manner possible. The Kingpin is shown as a brutal crime boss who rules without remorse.  Electra is cut-back in this version, but this version of the film she really is only a supporting cast member (which I prefer because her character was the weakest part of the theatrical cut, in my personal opinion).  Only character without improvement is the over-the-top Bullseye, but this is for the best seeing as Farrell's character really does work best as a whimsical enigma (Farrell does however get to drop the film's single F-bomb).<br /><br />2. New Scenes:  An entire subplot cut from the theatrical cut involves Matt Murdock represented a drug dealer (Coolio) who has been framed by the Kingpin for the murder of a prostitute.  This entire subplot works in developing a reason for Daredevil to want the Kingpin while in the theatrical cut it turns the hunt for Kingpin a simple revenge story of Daredevil getting angry over his murdered romantic lead.  Because of this the film takes on a new emotional depth.<br /><br />3. Alternate Scenes:  Scenes such as the love scene between Affleck and him in confession have been removed from this cut of Daredevil .  Those tacked on, crowd-pleasing moments that seemed to drag down the pacing of the film have been removed from the director's vision of the film creating better flow along with giving the hero a more tragic story.<br /><br />4. Fight Scenes:  Now, if you hated the Matrix/Spider-Man fight scenes from the theatrical cut I'm sorry to say those are still here.  I liked most of these fights (except the unnecessary one between Matt and Electra in the park which is just worthless filler) but the one that improves the most in this version is the climatic fight between Daredevil and Kingpin.  In the theatrical cut Kingpin is a pushover (in the theatrical cut you might as well turn the film off after Bullseye is taken out).  In the Director's Cut Michael Clarke Duncan takes the opportunity to remind us he was a professional bodyguard prior to breaking into the acting scene.  This is a brutal fight between a David and Goliath that doesn't let you down considering the way the film has built it up.<br /><br />5. Tone:  This film is no Spider-Man.  Action scenes might be similar, but the tone of this Director's Cut makes a fine attempt at following the footsteps as such greats as The Crow.<br /><br />6. Humor:  Even though this cut is far darker than the theatrical cut it also manages to insert a fair dose of brisk humor.  This allows leveling out the tension and making for a more exciting experience.  Action scenes are fun, but without interludes they just become boring, which was a primary problem with the theatrical cut.<br />Now, the Director's Cut is not without faults (hence why I only give it Four Stars).  It still suffers in the believability of its action scenes and the weak performances from Jennifer Garner, but overall it wins my approval.  Does that mean you'll like it?  Well, to put it in perspective I didn't necessarily \\"hate\\" the theatrical cut.  I just found it generic and dull.  Now, if you absolutely HATED the theatrical cut for its unbelievable action scenes, and the presence of Ben Affleck simply for being...Ben Affleck, odds are you will still detest this film.<br /><br /> If you thought the theatrical cut was only a missed opportunity?  I suggest you pick up a copy of the director's cut and prepare to see this film in a whole new light!  It isn't perfect, but it is a magnificent improvement!leasing moments that seemed to drag down the pacing of the film have been removed from the director's vision of the film creating better flow along with giving the hero a more tragic story.      4.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|This product was amazing for the price.Installation was a breeze with the cutout for cooler installation in my cooler master storm scout.Installation took less than an hour total for removal of old one to new installation.Plenty of room,not as big as what ppl are complaining about.It is bigger than a stock cooler but isnt that the point.My idle temps dropped from 29 to 21 and full load whether running prime 95,linx,or intel burn test at full load,my temps never climbed above 50 at a 3.2 oc with turbo enabled.Stock cooler i couldnt run  these tests at overclock as would overrheat at 75 within minutes.Recommend this to anyone before the price goes up.
B003E48AYC|5.0|If you are a fan of Lewis Carroll's classic \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" you will either love or hate this film - maybe some will find an in-between. It really depends on your take of the novel, and how you view it on the screen. In this particular case, Tim Burton was the director selected to put his very particular (i.e. dark) vision on film. The result, as I said, depends on your understanding of the original novel. Having said that, I found the movie to be quite entertaining and colorful, provided with great photography, and with the Burton signature on it.    The film begins with little Alice having a nightmare - one of many --, and being consoled by her loving and understanding father. It turns out that both Alice and her father have great imagination, and he instills in her not to be afraid and follow her dreams. We then fast-forward some years, and we find out that Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is now a beautiful 19-year old young lady. Sadly, her father passed away some years before. We meet her in an elaborated party, when she is about to get engaged to a young man that she dislikes. However, just about when she unwillingly is about to give the \\"yes\\", in front of many guests and relatives, a rabbit calls her attention, and she decides to follow him. The chase makes her fall into a deep hole, taking her to a surreal Underland. Once there, she meets and make friends with a series of characters, including the Cheshire Cat, Tweedledee & Tweedledum, the White Rabbit, and many more. And, of course, there is also the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). Together they will join forces to fight the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and Stayne (Crispin Glover - who else?), her right hand, and return the power to the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), its rightful and generous owner. By doing so, they'll first have to defeat the equally evil Jabberwocky.    As I mentioned earlier, if you are a fan of the original book, perhaps your take on \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" the movie, will be critical. Having that in mind, the film will prove to be good fun for almost all the family. The 3-Disc combo Pack includes a Blu-ray disc, a DVD version of the film, and a digital copy. The excellent Blu-ray disc, in addition to the film, is loaded with extras - some features explore the film's characters (Finding Alice, the Mad Hatter, The Futterwacken Dance, The Red Queen, and more) and other take a look at the making-of the movie (Scoring Wonderland, Stunts of Wonderland, Tea party Props, etc.). The DVD also includes some of these extras. Released June 1, 2010. (USA, 2010, color 109 min plus additional materials). Reviewed on June 15, 2010 exclusively by Eric Gonzalez for [...]
B002W24E0G|5.0|I've just listened to the samples on Amazon and have to say that I am blown away.  This is amazing and sounds like it was recorded 50 years ago.  I can't believe that someone has been able recreate this kind of ramped-up Rock N Roll.  Well Done Mr. Curran.  I am buying it right now!
0439023491|4.0|After reading the Hunger Games (Book 1)  Had to read Catching Fire.<br />We read both books for our book club and will do the third one \\"Mockingjay\\" for our September meeting.  It was unanimous, we changed the books originally selected so we could read this series!<br />Rivoting.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I bought all three books in this series and this one was the first. At the beginning I was worried that I may have made a mistake, it seemed like something I may not have liked. After reading the first several pages I really became interested in this book and by the time it ended I knew that I did not make a mistake at all, it was actually a really good book. I now look forward to reading the other two I have purchased.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|You can watch this in any version you want to.  It is a terrible movie.  It only serves to showcase how bright lights and loud noises can serve an audience.  There is no story there is no point.  This movie is a sin.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|For those of you that gave this all one star, please be aware that there is a separate Season 1, Volume 2 DVD being released: http://www.amazon.com/Glee-Episodes-13-21-Matthew-Morrison/dp/B003RWSC3K/ref=amb_link_353357702_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=product-alert&pf_rd_r=0T4MQ5YB8YD6VG27FM6A&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_p=1266525742&pf_rd_i=B002AMVEF6.     Of course splitting the season up is annoying, but it's typical when there is high demand for a show to be release and when it's known fact that plenty of people will pay for both volumes instead of waiting for the entire single set to be released. Sex and the City did the same thing with their sixth and final season.     Glee itself is an excellent show and the creators, actors, and other workers on the show shouldn't get a bad rap for those in charge of FOX marketing. FOX is going to take every advantage they can of Glee being such a huge hit - it's just the way it works.

B003F3NDP8|3.0|I've been waiting for this to come out so I can see the show in sequence.  The haphazard way that ABC ran this season was a major disappointment especially with all the breaks of a month in between episodes and reruns before the season was completed.  I recommend getting it on DVD which is why I gave up watching it because it was difficult to follow.  If ABC is trying to lose viewers, which they probably have, they did a great job with this series.    I only gave it three stars because the writing wasn't as good as previous seasons.  Besides the erratic broadcasting, the stories were weak compared to previous seasons and the serial killer story dragged on too long.  Of course ABC dragging on with the breaks in between episodes didn't help either.  The quality in Season Six compared to previous seasons was not up to par.  I think the series is losing steam.
B000UJ48O0|4.0|Loved the show...and love this collection of all 4 seasons.  All are in wide screen....and have pretty good quality.  I just wish I could find a set in HD!<br />Only down side of the set ( why I gave it only 4 stars ) is the book the DVDs are packed in.  Its nice and all...just the DVDs don't stay put...they were all over the place by the time it arrived at my door.  None were damaged, but I do see how they could be.
B000NY12CI|4.0|I'd much prefer reading an auto biography or biography than a history text.  Before this book my understanding of Muslim traditions and culture was limited to the press who insist \\"most\\" are not like the horror stories.  Given the actual statistics of honor killings (when recorded/reported), female genital mutilations, domestic assaults, and so on (knowing that these number are only a small count of what is really going on) -- I am no longer sure.  Aayan Hirsi (Magan) Ali paints a picture of what she believes \\"most\\" Muslims believe, especially those who are part of the Brotherhood and the many organizations who feel they are called by God to kill all non-believers (read all non-Muslims).  She explains their intense anger with the Western cultures who give both rights and responsibility to people (especially women).  Most of these Muslims come from corrupt governments and places that are so wracked with violence that people flee to ... the west.  Then they insist on recreating their culture intact within Western countries and continue the same corruptions and abuses.  She strongly advocates that those who flee Muslim countries should be forced to adapt to the languages, cultures and beliefs of the countries where they are immigrating.    Do I agree with her positions?  I don't know.  Was she justified in lying to receive asylum?  I'm not sure.  If what she says is absolute truth, then telling Muslims they must lie in the hard bed which they have made might be appropriate.  I am just not totally convinced that taking an all or nothing stance is ever good, right, or just.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|The contents are wonderful - stng is probably the best series ever to be broadcast on TV    Unfortunately I purchased the complete set used - \\"as good as new\\". The first disc (of 49) is almost unusable (cracks, skips, misses portions). The second disc is slightly better and the third is marginally better than the second. I should know  better than purchased used dvds. Let the buyer beware
0143116738|5.0|This is a life changing read!  I have gone out and bought more as gifts.  I can't express how wonderful it is to read all the stories about others and their passions and how they've listened to their hearts to find themselves in their Element!  Wonderful!
B003DZM54I|4.0|6-19-10 (UPDATE FROM PRIOR REVIEW SEE LOWER CASE BLURB.  CAP LOCKS FOR UPDATE BLURB) Does anyone expect superb music here?  You shouldn't (ACTUALY, AFTER SAMPLING THIS, I THINK IT ROCKS W/A SHOT OF LIQUOR).  This is about as what to expected from Vince and his helpers, (ACTUALY THIS HAS CAUGHT ME OFFGAURD, IT'S A BIT BETTER THAN I EXPECTED).  Hey I'll like it, after all I grew up the Crue, and every other 80's glam band from the 80's.  And, as long as their rockin' I'm happy.....touring that's another story.  Since this single is an original, I have nothing other than it's kinda cheezy (I STILL THINK IT'S A LITTLE WEAK, BUT IT STILL ROCKS).  But I like cover tunes, and so I think this Album will be pretty DAM!G good.  Vince has covered other songs out there on complilations, and I like them....so I'm sure I'll like this release.  THIS ALBUM ACTUALY SOUNDS GREAT!  I'M ALL OVER SPEAKER LEVEL 10 COME TUESDAY MORNING -RELEASE DAY- So, If you were born between 73 and 80....buy this record, you know you want too!
1881273156|5.0|What an answer to prayers!  Gary Chapman lays out the 5 basic \\"love languages\\" in very easy to understand language.  Understanding how to \\"fill the love tank\\" of your loved one is such an important element to any marriage or family, I think it should be taught in schools, churches, marriage counseling, etc.  If everyone was armed with this simple information the world would become a much better place.  We are so much in error thinking we are showing our love adequately to our loved ones.  What an enlightenment!  This will work with/for anyone, even friendships and acquaintences in the work place.  I can't say enough great things about the information this book has brought into my whole family's lives; we're all excited about it!  A great read!!

1423113381|5.0|He's taken kids who could be normal, personality-wise if not in circumstance this time, linked them up with a deity and set them loose. This time, the kids are not children of gods, but the children of former members of a society (of magicians!) dating back to the time of the Pharaohs that is dedicated to serving/controlling the gods of Egypt. Carter and Sadie are more powerful than most because of their lineage, but there is a Harry Potter-esque it-could-be-anyone thing going on that will open up the rest of the series for a lot of interesting sidekicks. At this point in the series there are only a few kids still training in this society, one of whom is already set up as the girl Carter will embarrassingly and awkwardly crush on for probably the rest of the series, but I'm sure Riordan will bring in a whole cast of interesting kids by the end.    The whole story is told from both Sadie and Carter's points of view in, more or less, alternating chapters. I really liked getting to see the story unfold through both of their eyes. The changing point of view didn't bog down the story, really, since everything was still told in sequence with little to no instances of both characters covering the same event. I did wish, however, that their was a bit more of a difference between their voices. When they're actually talking, there is plenty of difference between proper, nerdy Carter and punky, spunky Sadie, but when they're narrating they're not all that different. Every once in a while Sadie, as narrator, gets riled up about something and it's really clear that she's the one telling the story (the name of the narrator is on every page to help with that as well), but for the most part both of them just sound like Riordan.    Something that is mentioned on multiple occasions but is far from a focal point of the story is that Sadie and Carter's father is black and their mother was white. Both of the kids are biracial, but neither of them looks it. They have that mini-me thing going on with their parents: Sadie looks astonishingly like her mother and Carter looks just like his dad. In the beginning of the book, Sadie talks about how, without her mother there, people question her relationship to Carter and their father because she's so clearly white and they so clearly aren't. She talks about how annoying it is, on the few days a year that they get to spend together, that people question whether or not she belongs in her family. This is, of course, complicated because she doesn't feel like she belongs due to the very limited amount of time they are actually on the same continent. Also near the beginning, Carter expresses his envy of Sadie's normal life with their grandparents. He feels hurt and rejected because his grandparents fought so hard for Sadie and not for him. While I was reading, I wondered about that; why did their grandparents only fight for the grandchild that looks like them? There is a magically influences reason for why they only went to court for custody of Sadie, but I didn't feel like Carter really processed that information when he found out. Maybe because he wasn't thinking about it in the same way that I was, he didn't need the cathartic breakthrough that I was looking for. It was enough, for him, to know that without magical influence his grandparents may have fought just as hard to hold on to their grandson as they did their granddaughter. This is all balanced out by Sadie's feelings of abandonment because she was left with their grandparents rather than being allowed on the road with Carter and their dad, so maybe I'm reading too much into the situation.    Family issues aside (and I'm paying more attention to them here than was paid in the book), I love that Carter and Sadie's race was a non-issue. I do wish that both of them had been presented as biracial characters, or that they even saw themselves that way, rather than one white and one black, but I'm glad that this did not pick up elements of a \\"problem novel\\"about a biracial family. It is simply a fantasy book with biracial main characters!      Book source: Philly Free Library

B003INJETO|2.0|I love Pain of Salvation.  Every record they have done has taken their sound and evolved.  That is great.  The problem here, is that for this record they just decided to take everything they have done over the last decade and just throw it away to start in a totally different direction.    Imagine that Daniel (the main guy) wrote some songs, then gave them to Jack White of the White Stripes and said I want you to record this with some help from Muddy Waters and Danny Elfman, but keep the music pretty tame.  Oh, and add a little gospel in there.  This is what it sounds like.    I am all for artists going in new directions, but this really should have been released as a side project under a different name, because it sounds absolutely nothing like Pain of Salvation.    Now, once you get beyond that, there is some good stuff on this record, but it's feels jumpy and not very focused.  Imagine a greatest hits record, but instead of the hits, it's all the stuff that didn't make it onto the previous records.  This is definitely a record you should listen to completely before you buy it.  You may love it, but unfortunately, I didn't.    Edit: Just to be fair, I have listened to the album several more times through, and while it certainly has it's moments of greatness, overall I still think it is not a great record, and certainly not a great POS record.  The sound quality is not very good, the songs seem randomly put together, and the musical qualities are just not up to par compared to their previous releases.  As much as I want to like this record, I just can't get into it.  If they played the exact same songs but just made them heavier with more distorted guitars, I still would find it to be a weak record.
B003FXXNH6|4.0|If a casual fan of B-rate fight flicks were to come across this in the video store having not heard of the franchise, one could easily justify its dismissal.  Typically direct-to-video sequels to direct-to-video movies give fans just enough to barely keep them interested.  The fact that each new film in the series has switched the directions and motives of the main characters, in addition to making the previous antagonist the current protagonist is extremely refreshing.  Add to that some of the best fight choreography, filming, and editing this side of the Pacific ocean and you have a series of films that have increased in quality with each new release!  Director Isaac Florentine has taken his sweet time to give fans what they want to see.  And God bless him for it.  So much art is lost in the pursuit of cash.  I hope other directors are taking notes on his work.<br /><br />Scott Adkins (\\"Ninja\\", \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\") returns as Uri Boyka, former prison fighting champion, who now has a bum knee after his crushing defeat at the end of \\"Undisputed 2\\".  He wants Russian mob boss Gaga (Mark Ivanir, who makes a very welcome return) to enter him in the first international prison tournament where the grand prize is total freedom.  Gaga refuses, knowing of his bad leg and absense from competition, until Boyka absolutely wastes the current Russian champ.  Boyka then packs for the Republic of Georgia and the 8-man elimination contest.  There are fighters from France, Croatia, Brazil, Greece, Korea, America, and the favorite, Columbian born Dolor (Marko Zaror, \\"Kiltro\\"), resident of the host prison.  If the odds were not already stacked against Boyka, prison officials and mob bookies may have a few tricks up their collective sleeve to favor Dolor.<br /><br />The fights?  Awww, yeah!  Adkins has already proven he belongs at the top of the list of current martial arts actors.  I was particularly excited to see Lateef Crowder again after his awesome fight with Tony Jaa in \\"The Protector\\".  He has two fights here, neither of which disappoints!  The casting of Chilean actor Marko Zaror as the lead bad guy is really where the brilliance comes in to play.  I had heard much about his skill from word-of-mouth and youtube clips but I really didn't know what to expect.  He is fantastic, not only in physical skill, but in his character portrayal as well. He speaks excellent English, even to the point where his sly wit comes shining through.  I want to see a lot more of this dude!  He is 6-and-a-half-feet of spin kicking mayhem!<br /><br />This DVD has no special features and for that reason alone is disappointing.  Just a few trailers.  Not even a chapter selection!  I would like to see a lot more stuff with a release like this.  The blu-ray may have more, I'm not sure.  Who cares? This is still the most enjoyable film that I've seen in a LONG time.  I liked it more than \\"Undisputed 2\\" but I can't necessarily say that it's a better movie.  The script is nothing fancy but is more than adequate for fans of this type of movie.  Good character development, especially with Boyka and the American fighter, Turbo (Mykel Jenkins) and a few surprises.  4.5 of 5 and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!<br /><br />2010He has two fights here, neither of which disappoints!

B001C09KD0|5.0|Outstanding job LG. I read some of the reviews below and i never thought this book was just about spirituality. Its interesting when people think their readings are about God how uptight we get.  I took the book to be about LG travels around the world, love, romance, heart break, indecisiveness about life, decisions, and marriage to name a few. Bascially all the uncertainties of the world. I did appreciate that LG learned to fight the thoughts in her mind w/ meditation and hearing from God.  Great books!
B003A4IFGY|4.0|64 minutes in length approximately.  The sound is clean with a slight blending (\\"bleeding\\") of instruments that's one of the trademarks of musicians playing together in one room.  The disc is slipped in,bare,inside the cardboard fold-out holder,which,inside,has a posed,b&w photograph of the group in the studio.  The booklet contains the lyrics to each song,along with recording dates.  There are b&w photos of the group throughout the booklet.<br /><br />That subtle feeling of recording together is Petty's (and the band's) nod to recordings done \\"in the old days\\",when there was a certain sound and feel to rock 'n' roll albums.  This is another indication (another being the live set released a while back) of Petty's mind set of late-straightforward,honest music,played by a band who know their way around.  At this stage in Petty's (and the bands)career,it would be easy to try and sound \\"contemporary\\",or worse,simply rely on past glories.  Instead they have produced an honest collection of real music.  Sitting across from each other seems to have invigorated the band into playing some of their finest music yet,especially guitarist Mike Campbell.<br /><br />This album is full of r&r,blues,country,and anything else (the reggae feel of \\"Don't Pull Me Over\\") they feel like playing-all with that Petty/Heartbreakers sound.  There's even a jazzy walking-bass line underneath the opening guitar salvo,on \\"First Flash of Freedom\\",which,throughout,very subtly anchors  and carries this song.  This track also has the sound and feel (especially the vocals) of Petty's solo album \\"Highway Companion\\",and would fit snugly in that album.  The album is a good balance of up tempo songs (\\"Candy\\") and slower ballads (\\"The Trip to Pirate's Cove\\") that together paint a true picture of this band.  Tracks like \\"I Should Have Known It\\",\\"Jefferson Jericho Blues\\",'Running Man's Bible\\",and \\"U.S. 41\\",among others are full of that bluesy (especially \\"Takin' My Time\\"),r&r sound,that,combined with Petty's images,through his lyrics,show that the band has been re-ignited in the studio.<br /><br />Everyone will have their favorites,but most long time listeners will probably agree that the bands sound and approach has been re-energized.  Maybe it's Petty's stage of life,maybe it's Petty's and the bands reaction to present day music,maybe a combination of things.  But whatever the reason(s)this album is an example,an affirmation,of how basic rock 'n' roll should sound.  With this album TOM PETTY AND THE HEARTBREAKERS are keeping rock 'n' roll alive.  Hopefully the band will continue to play (and record) music like this in the future-but for now,this collection of songs will do nicely.is lyrics,show that the band has been re-ignited in the studio.

1603425381|5.0|First, I am not a crocheter (well, I should say \\"novice\\" and/or \\"wanna be\\").  I knit and enjoy knitting.  But some things are just meant for crocheting, and I think borders is just one of many that fit that category.  And, I found it`s very helpful to have 150 illustrations of how to crochet borders that go around corners.    Most of the borders are shown on 2 pages, facing each other.  There are a few that are continued onto a 3rd page, and then a few that use just one page: i.e. p. 116, 117 & 118 are for border #51; p.119 is for border #52.  Each border is beautifully photographed and the instructions are both written and charted.  And the text and charts are easy to read (well printed and good sized).    And while I prefer spiral binding, the paper stock is quality and the binding is sound enough (so far) to allow me to lay the book out flat... which is probably the reason for the odd size...  It is short and wide. At first glance it makes one wonder why... then when actually using the book and reading a 2-page border, it becomes obvious: it stays open to those 2 pages - well done.    The first 26 pages contain information on \\"Maintaining a Flat Edge\\"; \\"Calculating the Number of Stitches\\"; \\"Adjusting the number of stitches\\"; \\"Crocheting Borders on Woven Fabric\\" (also on Felted Fabric); \\"Reading Crochet Patterns\\" (as well as crochet charts), and more.    There are tips, one being a \\"Note to UK Crocheters\\" about the difference in US vs UK terms.    #1 border starts on p.28; #150 border ends on p.303.  \\"Crochet Punctuation\\" is p. 304-305.  \\"Crochet Symbols\\" are p. 306-307.  \\"Glossary and Abbreviations\\" are p. 308-311.  \\"Index\\" is p. 312-313.  \\"Chart Stitch Key\\" is p. 314-315.    This was just what I was looking for; yes, very pleased.  And, I`m looking to put my crochet needles to work - on some of these borders... and some other items as well... some things are meant to be crocheted.    Good luck.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|This is a very good album!  The band's previous two albums have always struck me as fairly lackluster compared to the energetic and highly creative output of the band in their heyday.  Well, a 20 year break from making albums seems to be exactly what they needed, because Something for Everybody is loud, fun, exciting, and very high energy!  DEVO manages to retain their quirky approach while sounding fresh and new.  They are in top form here, and although the boys are now in their 60s, you'd never guess it listening to this brilliant album.    Something for Everybody is a MUST HAVE for fans of DEVO.  I honestly wasn't expecting to like it as much as I do.  This one's going to stay in the CD player for a while.
0743539478|2.0|I really appreciate that none of the cds had any skips in it, but the fact that the 14th disc, the climax of the book, was from a totally different story, made me feel a little jipped. It seemed like a publishers error but for anyone to sell this product after knowing that, seems a little dishonest. Frustrating to miss a good chunk of the story.
B002YMWPUA|4.0|Personally I do not believe that fighting a cause, political or otherwise justifies any type of violence or terrorism.  From the beginning of the film we are introduced to the IRA prisoner on his check into the prison cell.  Long silences, slow motion camera moves on behalf of all participants in every scene are giving an enourmous depth to this movie.  Scenes from the prison are horrifying.  Prisoners are stripped of clothing, their hair is long, beard uncut for months at the time, their cells are smeared with feces and even their family visits are such horrific displayes of conveying messages that one cannot be indiferrent to the prison conditions and treatment of the prisoners.<br /><br />Everyone is deeply affected by these conditions, not just prisoners and their family members.  Prison guards, prison priest, special forces brought it to squash the last bit of humanity from prisoners are all part of te game.  It is touching to see that the first person to show some level of human compassion is a male prison nurse tending to Bobby Sands, leader who starts hunger strike in order to ensure that prisoner demands are met.  Actor Michael Fassbinder is captivating in his role of the determined 27-year young soldier determined to give away his life in order to gain some humanity in the process both for himself and his fellow soldiers.<br /><br />Not easy to watch at times, this film is definitely thought provoking.  In certain parts of th emovie we can hear portions of Margaret Thacher's speaches that are eerie, considering that it has been more than 25 years since she has been in power as Britain's Prime Minister.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|This is for everyone who bought the volume one dvd. According to [...], Fox will be issuing a ten dollar 'Gleebate' to those who purchased the volume one dvd when you buy the first full season. SO STOP COMPLAINING! Why does it surprise anyone in this day and age that companies are out to get every last one of your hard earned dollars? It's just how it is. It's not going to change. And why would anyone buy the volume one dvd when back in October or November (before the dvd came out) the show was picked up for a whole twenty-two episode season?  You had to see this was going to happen. So there it is. Get your rebate, and be done with it.<br /><br />  Now for anyone who hasn't seen the show, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!? This is one of the best tv shows to come along in a while.I won't go into detail what the show is about, but if you're into drama, comedy, and music this show is for you(the Madonna episode made the season for me). Just buy the dvd on September 14. You won't be disappointed.

B002ZG99CC|4.0|Along with thousands of other people, I was very hesitant about seeing this movie.  I had seen the original after all, and with Hollywood's obsession with remakes, I figured that this one would fall along the way-side like so many others.  Usually when a remake is done, it's best to create anew.  Come up with your own story and make it work.  Usually when remake is done like the original, it nearly always fails.  This is one of those rare times when it doesn't fail.<br /><br />Anyone who has seen the original version will find very few, if any, surprises.  The story is virtually identical.  However, the movie both fails and succeeds in this regard.  I mean, come on, can anyone truly top Daniel's kick at the end of the original film?  Doubtful.  However, one of the things that I loved better about this film, was that it takes place in China.  I felt that this was a slick move by the writers.  But the true strength of this film rests in its performers.<br /><br />Dre Parker's mother lands a job in Beijing, China.  So, they move.  Dre has no idea about where is going despite persistence from his mother to try and learn the language.  Day one shows up, and mesmerized by young Meiying who is an aspiring violinist.  Cheng, the school bully, steps in when he sees Dre becoming friends with her, and here the trouble starts.<br /><br />I'm going to say it right here...Jaden Smith is already an accomplished actor.  This young man has got an incredibly bright future ahead of him.  He holds his own on screen with Jackie Chan and everyone else.  He makes us feel sympathetic to his character's plight.  Unlike Daniel from the original film, Dre Parker is about half the size of the kids who are picking on him.  At first, he tries in vain to put up a fight.  Another area where Jaden excels is in his range of emotions.  There is a touching scene with Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), in which Jaden captures the hearts of the audience, if hasn't done so already.  I'm curious about how much time and training it took for Jaden to demonstrate some martial arts prowess.  I'll just say, for people who haven't seen the film yet, the skill level is high, and you will see some very fast and exciting moves in this film, which frankly, is superior to the original.  However one question must be raised about how quickly a student can absorb all of this knowledge and apply it.  However, is is passable even if questionable.<br /><br />This is the first time I've seen Jackie Chan in a serious role.  His challenge is greater than Jaden's because in the original film, Pat Morita was the heart and soul of the \\"Karate Kid\\" movies as the wise sage, Mr. Miyagi.  This was the one area where I had the biggest doubts about.  Over the years, I've heard people mention Mr. Miyagi in the same breath as Yoda.  That's how much impact he had on the audience.  Mr. Miyagi wasn't just teaching Daniel about martial arts, but also about life, and how martial arts is about achieving a physical harmony and balance.  I must say that Jackie Chan did a respectable job, and even a very good one.  I still prefer Pat Morita, but Chan was very good too.  The same thoughts go into Dre's training...that this isn't just martial arts training, but life training.  We sense that Mr. Han's past has haunted him more than the past seems to have haunted Mr. Miyagi, and this aspect is actually quite touching; especially a scene involving Dre and Mr. Han.  The tragic aspect to Mr. Han's life is explored a bit more deeply than Mr. Miyagi's, which adds depth and a very real human quality to the character.<br /><br />Dre's first, and perhaps only true friend, is Meiying played beautifully by Wenwen Han.  She and Jaden Smith have a wonderful on-screen chemistry that works for the film very well.  There isn't quite the tension that existed in the original film between Daniel and Ali, but then the ages of Dre and Meiying is about 12-years-old.  Part of Dre's education is learning about cultural differences, and one area where he gets into trouble regarding Meiying.<br /><br />The visuals in this movie are wonderful.  The cinematography as we are treated to spectacular views of the Great Wall, some of the dense forests, and mountainous terrain are breath-taking.  Perhaps one of my favorite scenes in the entire film comes when Mr. Han takes Dre to a mountain temple (you'll recognize this as the same one used in \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\") where various Chinese students and masters are engaged in practicing martial arts.<br /><br />As I said, the major drawback for this movie, is that if you have seen the original, you'll be treated to very few surprises.  Even some of the dialogue is the same in some areas.  However, had the original movie never been made, I feel that this film would easily stand on its own feet without being caught in the shadows of the original.  I feel that much of the negative feedback that this movie is getting is unjustified.  It is a fun movie, with great performances, and even touching ones.<br /><br />So, if you haven't seen the original film, or you haven't seen the original film in a while, see this one first.  Without the expectations, you might give this film more credence than you might otherwise.  If you have seen the original many times, just as I have, try not to over-analyze it.  You know the story.  You know the routine.  So, try to simply enjoy it for what it is, rather than what it is not.  As far as remakes go, this is one of the best ones done, in my opinion.  I think you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was at how well done this move is, as well as taking note of a talent on the rise...Jaden Smith.ng Meiying.

B002ZFQD0E|4.0|Janelle Monae is sort of a musical genius.  While I can't claim this album to be a perfect one, for it does contain a few songs I don't care for, and some I don't `get', there is no denying that Monae has constructed a truly innovative, exciting and unique musical experience for anyone lucky enough to hear it.  While I can't give it five stars myself, I must admit that I am really happy to see so many five star reviews from other reviewers.  Janelle Monae is one of those artists who actually deserves a fan base, and so I'm comforted to see that she has one.<br /><br />The album, for me, opens and closes magnificently.  `Dance or Die' may possibly be my favorite track on the album (possibly my favorite track she's ever released).  The alienesque hip-hop influences are signature for her, something that I totally expected after listening to `Metropolis', but she perfected it beautifully.  Her vocals are outstanding, considering the robotic delivery.  She just drips with style.  The closing track, `BaBopBye Ya' brought me to a strange yet appropriate realization; Janelle Monae is a modernized Bjork.  This girl knows who she is and she is prepared to push nearly every envelope (musically) she can.  The closing track is a stunning example of theatricality at it's finest.  The swagger she incorporates into the orchestral arrangement brings to mind a 40's film noir set on a Broadway stage.<br /><br />Yes, this girl can do nearly anything.<br /><br />As a total fan of The Noisettes, `Come Alive (War of the Roses)' is a standout for me.  With razor sharp edges that sound almost as if she were being backed up by System of a Down, this track is infectious and unforgettable.  Switching gears completely, `Sir Greendown' sounds like a ballad from a pre-Motown era.  It is stunning, to put it bluntly.  She swoons like the best of them, calling to mind Paul Anka and Elvis Presley.  Speaking of influences, the gorgeous `57821' screams SIMON AND GARFUNKEL and I must say she does them total justice.  The track has such serene beauty, slow and sweeping and entrancing.<br /><br />I've already spouted off on `Tightrope' back when I DL'd the single, and I still really like it.  Yes, it does seem far less experimental as her other work, more straightforward hip-hop than anything else, but she works magic with it (as does Big Boi).<br /><br />`Oh, Maker' has grown and grown on me, especially when you consider the beautiful message, which sits softly on her beautiful delivery.  It is not a very experimental track, but it has a very distinct charm to it, and Monae's vocals are simply divine.  `Make the Bus' is another track that has grown on me.  It was, initially, one of my least favorites, but its outrageousness has become strangely endearing.  It reminds me a tad of Miko (an artist I kind of hate) but Janelle actually sells this odd breed of pop.  If anything else, it is truly innovative and interesting.<br /><br />With an album that certainly explores multi-directional territories, there are a few songs that get lost in the shuffle due to not standing out quite as well as others.  `Neon Valley Street' is beautiful, but it is also a tad repetitive and forgettable.  `Say You'll Go', while intoxicating, is not a focal point of the album and is easily forgotten.<br /><br />`Locked Inside', `Cold War' and `Wonderland' are catchy and exciting, but they don't have the impact some of the other tracks have.  Of the three, `Wonderland' is my favorite.  It is bouncy and interesting; it just doesn't sell it completely.  I like the idea behind it, and it certainly `stands out' as being one of a kind on the album, but part of its appeal is actually part of the reason I don't think it's great; it can get somewhat annoying.  `Faster' probably should be higher on my list, I just don't really care for it.  It seems kind of like a throwaway to me, but that's just my opinion.<br /><br />And then we have `Mushrooms & Roses' and `Neon Gumbo', two tracks that certainly showrange and uniqueness but also make me raise an eyebrow.  They are just `strange' songs.  These are not tracks to simply listen to, especially `Mushrooms & Roses' (since `Neon Gumbo' plays out more like an intro than a song).  Strangeness aside, `Mushrooms & Roses' is actually pretty interesting, and it is beautifully produced.  I like the song, I just don't think many people will get it (although the astounding amount of five-star reviews proves me wrong in that regard).<br /><br />In the end I must say that this album is very solid and an all around delight.  Like I said, it's not `perfect' but it is certainly one of the more rewarding albums I've heard in a while because it isn't afraid to take risks, and most of those risks pay off big.  I'd give it an objective B+, but a solid A certainly isn't out of the question!hey are just `strange' songs.

B003AO1SVS|5.0|Absolutely a great album in every respect.  If you like one Black Keys song, you'll like them all.  This album is a bit funkier and soulful than their others, but The Black Keys stay true to their sound and put out another fantastic album.  Better than Attack and Release, and as good as Rubber Factory.  I cannot understand how some reviewers are longtime fans of the band, and lament how this is a complete new direction and they lost their way.  Can anyone think a band seven albums in (counting Chulahoma) that have changed LESS than the Black Keys?  Seriously.  Play their albums back to back, these songs belong alongside their earlier ones in spirit and sound.

B003CIG7AE|4.0|I must like this, because I find myself playing it all the time.  But yet, it doesn't seem so great when I think about it.  Somehow, the album creates a sound and mood that is greater than a sum of its songs.  At least for me.  I have both of their other albums, and to me this doesn't sound so different like others suggest.  It may be a bit mellower overall, but is true to their earlier sound to my ears.
B00129JSMY|5.0|I cannot recommend this movie enough.  Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as the main character *and* as the narrator (who constantly breaks the \\"fourth wall\\" and talks to you as if you are watching a movie!  Val Kilmer also delivers a grand performance, as expected, and the scenes with the two of them together (most of the movie) are hilarious!!<br /><br />If you are expecting a plot synopsis, look elsewhere.  I do not spoil movies like this.<br /><br />Essentially, this movie is part film noir detective, part eighties buddy action flick, part comedy.  And it works like a charm!  If you are so inclined after watching the movie, watch it again with the cast/director commentary.  They continue to make you laugh even more in that!!<br /><br />So, buy it.  Watch it.  Love it.  Recommend it to others.  And no, I was not paid by anyone to write this review.  (But I wouldn't say no to some \\"thank you\\" money...  Val?  Robert?  Anyone?) ;-)
B001Q9J4PG|4.0|I come from a background of reading horror, sci-fi, and thriller, but Rainbow Six was the first Clancy Book I've read. I gotta say I liked it. Yes, the characters are all supermen. But I believe it is actually more realistic if a group of people like this existed than didn't. And to say that there was no plot is a lie . . . Although the first half of the book follows a repetitive path. But that's not the reason I give it four out of five. The dialog wasn't much different from character to character--you'll find all characters saying things \\"dubiously\\" quite often, and things like \\"you say so.\\" It seems like I'm being a prick but this is just something that irks me because it makes the characters feel unnatural. You may not be bothered by it.    Besides that little thing, the book is superb. The action is intense, the technology is cool, and the plot is cool, the bad guys have a frightening plan, and the ending is kinda unexpected (won't give it away). And despite my previous remark about the dialog, I still find myself enjoying the conversations the characters have. Great job, Mr. Clancy.    4/5
B002ZG9788|3.0|While the special effects of Clash of the Titans were, by all means, spectacular, the lack of story is a portrayal of what Hollywood is creating to entertain the viewers. The viewers, in a sense, are getting what they wanted from this film, intense action sequences with superb special effects. Seeing that violent battle scenes and special effects are what sell, the makers of this movie decided to scrap any story that could have been made to make room for more excessively detailed monsters and environments. This movie and movies like it (2012, Transformers 2, Ninja Assassin, etc.) had potential (excluding Ninja Assassin) to be smart, well told stories that would 'wow' the audience but at the same time, have some substance so that it could be enjoyed by a wider audience. This movie is one of the reasons I wish Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) and many other directors (Guy Ritchie(Lock, Stock, and Two Smokin' Barrels), Martin Scorsese (The Departed)) would never take a break from there work so that the public could continue (or start, depending on the person) to see that films aren't just a means of entertainment, but a form of art.    This doesn't really have anything to do with what I'm reviewing, so. . .  I didn't really like this film. It had potential, the cast was for the most part good, and its based off a story. I mean, how do you screw up story?    PS- I listed Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie, and Martin Scorsese because they create films that are extremely well done and intellectual, and have lots of violence.
B000S5BUXI|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's from the past decade, but one clearly not for everybody. The instrumentation (guitar, strings, piano, horns) is subtly layered, most of the songs are slower paced, and Matt Berninger sings in a controlled baritone which sounds very similar to The Tindersticks for those familar with that group. The opening song \\"Fake Empire\\" sets the tone for the whole CD and If you listen to the snippet for \\"Fake Empire\\" on the Amazon site you'll geta feel for whole of the CD. Highlights for me are \\"Fake Empire\\", \\"Start a War\\", and \\"Slow Show\\". The only song to me that seems slightly out of place is \\"Mistaken for Strangers\\" which is slightly harsher and sounds a little like Interpol.    Great night time record.

Not only do they think outside the box, they think realistically. Genius in its simplicity. nuff said.
B000059ZIC|5.0|Another true classic, this one, and in very good sound as well. Josef Suk's playing style embodied (or embodies) a nobility and sophistication - in addition to strength and panache - almost ideally suited to Brahms's three violin sonatas. The playing shimmers and glows, and the melodic lines sound almost effortless even though he supplies the requisite smoldering intensity when called for. The tone is round and warm and beautiful and the phrasing magnificently unforced. No need for Suk to deploy artificial tricks (slight acceleration or crescendos) to build climaxes and tension. Quite simply marvelous playing.    Julius Katchen is almost as outstanding, never impassive or reticient but always in perfect attunement to the violin playing - this is superb piano playing in its own right, with poetry and depth aplenty but works additional wonders in partnership with the Suk's magnificent performance. The sound quality is outstanding as well; the transfers are warm and full-bodied - they won't exactly manage to fool anyone into thinking these are modern recordings, but sound quality on the level of the almost glowingly golden hue of these analogue recordings are rarely achieved even today. Urgently recommended if you don't already have it.
B00004BZ16|4.0|ambitious is a word commonly attribute to double albums, which is why most record companies are against it. for one reason or another, bands like the clash and led zeppelin like to break free and just do it, throw it all in pot and see what happens. there are only a handful of successful double albums. on an artistic level, sandanista is a success. it essentially pre dates what strummer and jones were going to do in their respective solo careers, all outside of punk. the clash could only take punk so far, so they give raggae, dub and folk all a go on one rather brilliant album which must be listened to carefully and as a whole. it's all in pieces but the songs stand out for their energy and ingenuity. there are some singles on here too like charlie and magnificent, but really kind of a picasso album with weird brush strokes, here and there, that make you look scratch your head, put your hand on your mouth, until you say 'uh hum.' a true post punk album in the tradition of PIL.

B003C1SPX8|5.0|I couldn't be happier that \\"Alchemy\\" is on DVD at last! Over the years I have worn out two VHS copies, and the CD is among the most played in my library, so I'm thrilled to finally have a shiny new DVD in my hands. Some have criticized the DVD for having imperfect picture quality, and it's true that there are imperfections, the notorious \\"hair\\" on one of the cameras' images towards the end of the show is the most objectionable artifact, and I too wish the picture had been cleaned up a bit, but it is certainly not as onerous as some make it sound. Remember that this DVD is from a single show that occurred at the Hammersmith Odeon in London on July 23, 1983, and was shot on 16 mm film: given the vintage of the footage, I think the image is more than acceptable (though I'm not sure it's worth the extra for the Blu-ray disc) and any imperfections are more than made up for in the quality of the audio track, which is superb.<br /><br />I have always been a huge fan of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler, primarily because of their musicianship. It's pretty amazing that the musical craft was so highly prized that there was a point made to put a note on the cover reading \\"This is a recording of excerpts of one Dire Straits performance, it contains no re-recordings or overdubs of any kind.\\" It is not uncommon for live albums to be tweaked in the studio, and given the complexity of the material here, it's astonishing that the concert is musically flawless.<br /><br />This concert was done at the heights of pre-\\"Brothers in Arms\\" fame, and contains much of their best material. With the much improved sound quality of the DVD (versus VHS) the crispness of the recording is readily appreciated, and people who have watched it on both will notice differences between the two readily (I noticed the biggest difference in Mel Collins' saxophone part on \\"Two Young Lovers.\\") There is nothing to critique on the performances, and I still think of these versions of \\"Telegraph Road\\" and \\"Going Home\\" as the finest ever recorded.<br /><br />The DVD also comes with a couple of extras including the captivating BBC documentary on the exhausted band after \\"Communiqu&eacute;\\" was released. At the time the band was still a foursome and interviews of the original four members are extensive, as is footage in the studio revealing the song development process. I found it especially fascinating to watch how \\"Making Movies\\" progressed from the embryonic form shown here to the final recorded version. Any fan will love to have this feature, and it justifies the cost of the DVD by itself in my estimation.<br /><br />I highly recommend this DVD. Despite some visual imperfections, the music is sublime and more than makes up for any shortcomings in the image, but that's what you should expect from Knopfler and company: the bottom line is always about the music, and overdubs are never required.t ever recorded.

B000026KG7|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the best albums in the history of rock - and there's really no need to qualify this statement by referring to prog alone.   Quite simply, it is an amazing *complete album*, a rare pearl that urges you to sit and listen from start to finish as if it were a single composition rather than a collection of songs. And then sit through it again and again.   In that sense, the bonus tracks are redundant in my opinion, because the album needs to end with the magnificent April - not a second later.

B000SEKO4K|3.0|The Modern Library Shakespeare Complete Works is by far the best Kindle edition available.<br /><br />It has Jonathan Bate's excellent editing of all the plays and poems, with the notes properly hyperlinked, and there are all the notes you need, not to mention excellent introductions to each play.<br /><br />The Kindle version is the only one I've seen (and I think I've looked at almost all of them) that sets verse as verse, sets prose as prose, and<br /><br />1) indents continued lines of verse the right way, so that the continuations are<br />  indented,<br /><br />2) sets prose so that, no matter what size you have the Kindle set at, the prose lines are properly justified, and each of them goes all the way to the right hand margin.<br /><br />3) has full character names in boldface, and boldface stage directions.<br /><br />It's a miracle.<br /><br />As you may know, Amazon crams all reviews of things like the complete Shakespeare together, so that I had to put this rave for the Modern Library Kindle edition right on top of a less favorable review of the Oxford Kindle edition. That unfavorable review follows.<br /><br />----- -----<br /><br />At the price of nearly $30, the Kindle Oxford Complete Shakespeare is a bad bargain.<br /><br />Another reviewer says that many of the lines end with line-numbers, and that these numbers are not in the right hand margin, but right after the last word in the lines, which is confusing and annoying. Then the reviewer takes it back and says he was mistaken. He wasn't. He got it right, except that there are line numbers only now and then, here and there, which means you can't even count on finding the line numbers when you need them, but continue to have all the annoyance of having to disregard them at line ends when they DO show up.<br /><br />It is true also that there are no reverse accent marks (the sign \ over an &#34;-ed&#34; ending) to indicate when &#34;-ed&#34; endings are pronounced to rhyme with &#34;head.&#34; Those marks ARE in the Oxford printed text; in the Kindle version, you can't tell the difference between, say, &#34;inform'd&#34; and &#34;informed,&#34; since both are printed the second way and the mark Oxford uses to distinguish them is in the book, but not in the Kindle version.<br /><br />There are also passages where verse is set as prose.<br /><br />Overall, this edition is better than the complete editions you can get here for a dollar or so, but paying two thousand eight hundred percent more for a couple fewer errors probably won't appeal to many readers.<br /><br />Some day the major companies will develop enough respect for the Kindle that they'll do serious proofreading of their Kindle versions. In the meantime, I figure the price alone will result in an effective boycott of this edition from Kindle customers. It certainly should.<br /><br />P. S. I just downloaded the Tom Corbett Space Cadet series for something like three bucks, and I read the first volume. It was pristine: completely typo free.

193413712X|1.0|I, like other reviewers, am appalled that his travesty of a 'novel' won a Pulitzer.  I felt like I kept waiting....... and....... waiting....... and waiting some more for any type of plot to develop.  Harding tries extremely hard at being an author, it just shows in his pretentious writing style.  He writes endlessly about the nuances of clocks and how to fix them (Unnecessarily long & for the most part irrelevant).  His writing is too wordy & needs to be edited.  Harding also goes off on tangents way too long to describe a specific backdrop. It's the equivalent of somebody talking just to hear themselves talk.  It was perhaps the longest 190 pages I've ever read.  Don't even get me started on the lack of character development.  I had zero empathy or emotional connection to any of the characters, which is disappointing considering this book involved flashbacks to childhood and eventual death.  Long story short, I was very disengaged with this book, move on to the next one if you're considering picking it up.

B003JAD3BQ|4.0|Breaking Bad is amazing. I won't belabor the point. I'm here to discuss the following.  I'm not sure why but Season 3 seems to be recorded lower than the first two. In my house with no background noise, 3 feet from my laptop (a media center type with plenty of speaker power), I strain to hear it. Video player at 100%, laptop volume at 100%, it doesn't even hit 25% of peak level on the sound card. Somebody tell them to adjust it please?
B000063JZQ|4.0|I'll close out my trio of reviews concerning cinematic adaptations of Shakespeare from my college years with one of the most notorious film versions of all, Roman Polanski's adaptation of MACBETH. His first film after the murder of Sharon Tate was heavily criticized for its excessive violence although it's all right there in the text. The film was co-financed by Hugh Hefner which led to two very controversial scenes, naked witches and a nude sleepwalking scene for Lady Macbeth. Now that the shock effect has worn off (Julie Taymor's TITUS is far more explicit), what we are left with is a quality adaptation that really brings out the supernatural elements of the play. Yes, this Macbeth is ambitious, but in this version his choices are the result of dark forces working against him rather than active choices on his part.<br /><br />Jon Finch and Francesca Annis head a cast of solid but lesser known British supporting players who bring the various characters to life. John Stride's duplicitous Ross is especially memorable. When I first saw the film I thought the two Macbeths were perfectly cast from a physical point of view but that both were somewhat underwhelming. I still think that today but then this version is all about atmosphere. It's Hammer Horror meets Shakespeare and I don't have a problem with that. Gilbert Taylor's stunning cinematography (captured on this DVD in the proper aspect ratio) of various locations in Wales, the haunting music by the The Third Ear Band (released as a soundtrack album), and the omnipresent feeling of death and despair make this MACBETH a remarkaable if not especially pleasant experience. Incidentally, I don't know if Sony knows the difference, but that's Banquo on the DVD cover not Macbeth.

I dont know how this work but I noticed that the disc was shipped from Germany and it includes portuguese subtitles what is very good because I'm from Brazil. What I am trying to tell here is that I think Amazon looks for the perfect version of the blu-ray disc to send you depending from where you buy them. Does anyone know if this is true? Anyway, thanks Amazon.

0783226063|5.0|Any time a movie can be made from a book and actually get as close to the story as possible, knowing it can't do page from page, is quite an accomplishment.

It was delivered sooner than expected.  Great job guys.

If you enjoy movies with a strong protaganist, you'll love this movie. If you love seeing Gary Oldman as the bad guy, you'll definitely love this movie. Also, if you enjoy stories of faith... You'll love this movie. It's worth watching at least once.
0307582884|1.0|I actually listened to this book on cd, but it was so painful I barely made it through. I won't even go into the plot, which was fairly nonexistent and mostly withheld for the rest of the series. My main problems were with the over-description and the main character. Seemingly after every sentence, the author would write Thomas' thoughts and reaction, even if it was redundant and annoying. I found myself thinking that the book would be much, much better if whole sections of these commentaries were cut out and made apparent by Thomas' actions or his words. This would have been impossible, of course, because in his head all Thomas did was whine and complain, while when he spoke or acted he was a completely different, confident person who had all sorts of special abilities. It was like he was two different characters that were completely disconnected from each other. On top of this, everything was described in painstaking detail. I remember one scene that went something like this: \\"It was pouring rain. It covered the windows, like a dark beast. The water streamed down, connecting in rivers and running down the glass. Insert metaphor here, etc, etc..\\" On and on and on about RAIN, and that was not even a main point of the scene. The whole book was like this. So, for a horribly annoying bipolar main character and poor writing, this book gets one star.

You should be happy with your performance and feel good about. You need someone to say \\"Great job!\\" - wow, great job!
0792163710|5.0|The DVD transfer is very good and the Technicolor is vivid and clean.  The costuming is authentic and the sets are perfect.  The outdoor locations are a wonder in color.    If you think that a movie made over 50 years ago isn't worth your time, think again.  No Western ever made is better.  Trust me, I have literally hundreds of Westerns in my collection.  The story begins with drifter Shane (Alsn Ladd) riding up to a farm where Joe Starrett (Van Heflin), his wife, Marian (Jean Arthur) and son Joey (Brandon De Wilde) toil to make a farm from nothing.  At first, Shane is perceived as a villian and is told to ride on but when he comes back to aid the family in a confrontation with the antagonists, ranchers led by Rufus Ryker (Emile Meyer), Shane is welcomed and hired to help with the farm.  From there the story unfolds as both a struggle between factions, farmers and ranchers, and a study of a man seeking to escape his past.  We are never told exactly what that past is but it becomes evident that Shane was a gunfighter.    Shane joins the struggle as if the cause was his own.  There is a growing attraction between Shane and Marian Starrett that stays as it should, just an attraction.  Young Joey is anamored with Shane, his confidence and his prowness with a gun.  When Shane goes into town to pick up fencing, he encounters the Rykers and walks away from a fight even after being insulted by Chris Calloway (Ben Johnson).  The rancers continue to harass the farmers, driving one off and bringing doubt and debate to the rest of the group.  When the farmers return to town together to pick up supplies, Shane answers Calloway's challenge with a rousing barroom brawl in which he and Joe seem to get the best of a larger group.  The fight inspires the farmers to press on.  One farmer, Frank \\"Stonewall\\" Torrey (Elisha Cook, Jr.), goes to the bar to drink whiskey.  His new found courage, brought about by the victorious fight scene, leads him to challange a hired gun, Jack Wilson (Jack Palance).  Frank is shot dead.  The tension builds until Joe decides he must go to town to meet Ryker but Shane knows Joe cannot handle the gunfighter.  Shane and Joe engage in one of the best fight scenes you will ever see in a movie.  Shane wins but shakes little Joey's admiration when he hits big Joe with his gun.    The final confrontation between Shane and the ranchers with the gunfighter is a classic with no wasted histrionics or undo hype.  Director George Stevens crafted a masterpiece film which has stood the test of time.  The ensemble cast could not be better and if there are highlight performances, they belong to Jean Arthur and Jack Palance.    Highly recommended for all audiences except the youngest children.
B003CIG7AE|4.0|Great Album! So much of it seems like a natural progression of an artist.      Beautiful sound, lyrics, and melodies.      Some of these reviews are crazy. Who wants a band to produce a copy of the previous work? This stands on it's own.

However, I rated this book as four stars because the ending p*ssed me off. I would rather the book have been longer with a more descriptive ending. Why James decided to end this great story so abruptly is a mystery.

B0024FAR5W|5.0|Good drama and an excellent cast, could not have been casted better.  I would rate this show right up with Battlestar Gallactica, which was another 5 star show in my opinion.    If you like gritty and intense sequences then this is for you. I won't give away any details except this is a show for adults only, language and violence are predominant. All people casted are believable.    Katey Sagal is cast so well in this series. Nice to see her in this type of show, rather than another comedy roll, although their are moments where it is injected perfectly. Ron Perlman is also cast well, good fit for this show.

B000IOM0YM|4.0|If you're a big Kiss fan and don't already own this, there's a few things to know. Like any fan or critic or has reviewed this this information can be found on probably any of their essays as well but being a huge fan of the band I to must voice a little distress with what seems to be a lack of care on the bands part in putting this together. For years fans were waiting for this footage to be released \\"offically\\". 1994's Kiss My Ass along with a few other VHS's they had put out wet appetites for quite a while on vintage 70's Ace/Peter Kiss performances. This first in a 3 part collection attempts to give it to fans of course for a hefty price and even the obvious lure and bait of putting different bonus discs in each set so people would buy all 3 different versions of each set, which is ludricrious.     Anyway, this is by far the best of the 3 as it covers the band in their prime, some of the earliest footage of them playing a small auditorium captures the track Acrobat which msot fans know was the 2nd part to the Love Theme From Kiss off their debut that was scrapped and its pretty cool, albeit the wear and tear of the footage (its 30 years old). The coolest thing on the set is the pre fame Kiss stuff, when they were doing TV appearences. Gene on the Mike Douglas Show (which the Kissing contest stuff edited out, WHICH can be found online) one mark taken away for that, and the complete 3 song performance they did on ABC's In Concert which is great. Seeing Kiss when they were still a widely unknown cult band, low budget outfits, no overblown pyro, is great, it really is the real Kiss. When the music meant the most, the band were playing great and it certianly wasn't mediocre like today's Kiss. With that said, the Cadillac Michigan appearence is there, along with the Alive! Promo clips, a great show on the Hotter Than Hell tour at Winterland in classic B&W, and a great show in early 76, following their breakthrough from the Alive! album wraps up the bands 'early era' nicely.     The success years are covered by their appearence on The Paul Lynde Halloween Special in Oct 76, although there the lipsynced Detriot Rock City and Beth and I believe there is one other short jokey host segment they did that isn't included, which sucks. The best concert here, I think though is the 1977 Budokan show, pre Love Gun. Great sound, great quality, played on a nice system its perfect. Then you get the Don Kirshner Rock Concert clip, and the Love Gun tour show, which is Houston 1977. Now, fans have owned bootlegs of most of this stuff for years, and the reasons they edited footage is really stupid and really knocks alot of resons to get this away. But if you really want this stuff its there. Commentary tracks are sort of enlightning but as usual, Gene and Paul are vague and sort of insinuating when it comes to talking about their other band members. The bonus disc isnt that great, a show from NYC on the Rock N Roll Over tour. There's alot of other cool stuff that coulda been on here, like the TV ad's for Hotter Than Hell, R&RO, and Alive II, the Kiss radio (lol), and the SNL sketch with Steve Belushi, which was all on Kiss My Ass. But if you really want one set, this one is pretty good, and the best of the 3.
0446563048|5.0|It's a fun and easy read that puts onto paper many of the thoughts I've already had in my mind.  And of course, I've learned so much from it too. The funny thing is that I knew nothing about this book or the author at all. The title drew me in and it was just released and at the top of the charts.  So I decided to give it a try and let me tell you... it delivered.    Careers are always on everybody's mind. Is it exactly what you want to do?  Are you doing it just for the money, or for the status, or just because?  This book tells how he became successful, almost lost it all for the company he runs now, and could have never been happier.  He found passion and purpose.  He created a business, a culture, and core values that everybody in the company has grown personally and professionally.    Anybody working for a small business knows the trials and tribulations.  I highly recommend this book to anyone as a great source of inspiration.
B00009W0U4|5.0|What can I say about this movie? Irreversible is a movie to truly test your mind. Any movie that pressures down on any indignities  in life is a masterpiece, in my mind anyway, and Irreversible does just that. A lot of people, not all, would view this movie and think of it as a morbid waste of time. The chicks with dicks, gay sex and beautiful rape scene are a couple of shocking moments of this movie that people might see and crusifie the film soon after. Im not giving any more details away then the few discriptions I just pointed out. If they offend you enough then please dont waste your time and go watch a comedy. You may be better off :).
0385737947|4.0|Dystopian novels are rising on the popularity scale these days. While I think that Hunger Games is a pretty hard book to compare others too, James Dashner's Maze Runner can definitely be on the list of to read under this genre.    What a strange strange world the Glade was, smack right in the middle of a huge maze where teenager boys with penchant for weird lingo lives. I thought I would give up for reading the work \\"shank\\" and klunk\\" so many time! I cringe every time I read it. Is the sure of such words really necessary? Aside from the Gladers choice for curse words and all other important information that you need to know about them mentioned at the blurb the only things that that they can remember are their names and how to do things that keeps them alive from day to day. Each any everyone of them have a chore to do. And they were organized and there is order. Most of the time I keep forgetting that they are kids not adults trying to figure out what they are doing in the maze where doors closed up at night so the monsters called Grievers won't sting them.    I think Maze Runner is one of those books that you would have to develop an acquired taste for. You must embrace the strangeness and chaotic world. I was only really pumped up when Thomas broke the number one rule of the Glade, most especially when Teresa woke up. Don't get me wrong it was not boring and chapters before that part was essential it just felt like too long for me. So when my friend Tina in GoodReads said that her friend gave up after chapter 5, I did not even question it because I almost gave up myself. But the mystery of who the Creators are and the true purpose of WICKED kept me going. And the codes! what is up with that? It was borderline sci-fi at that point and I still don't know how I feel about that but it was really an awesome read.
0307454541|1.0|There were parts of this story that were wonderful. Honestly this is one of the worst books I have ever read. And although if it were written well I would not mind giving it to a teen, since it was not I would not recommend it to anyone.<br />It was a disapointment.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|A generation has passed since Devo's last full album (1990), and two generations have passed since the band's signature smash hit, \\"Whip It.\\" That really puts things into perspective. And the funny thing is, when you listen to this brand new set of songs, it is like they never really left us. This album is a throwback to the synth-pop heyday of the 1980's, but it really doesn't sound that out of place in today's market. The reason is because of the hooks. \\"Fresh\\" and \\"Watch Us Work It\\" are winning tracks, both released as singles. But the catchiness and wisecracking lyrics make for an engaging listen, and the hooks don't wear thin with repetition - this is an album that can be listened to over and over.<br /><br />Growing up in the 1980's, perhaps it is easy for me to appreciate this more than some others. But at the end of the day, this album is a very good one, hands down. It does not matter what era these guys are from. We've seen some oldies but goodies release very good albums in the last few years (Tom Petty, Asia, Peter Frampton, Bananarama, Ratt, Cyndi Lauper, AC/DC, Europe, Prince), so while it is not surprising to me that Devo was capable of creating an album this good, it is a little shocking that they were able to do it after being away from it all for so long. Good for them. This album rocks!
B002ZCDR88|5.0|This album is a lovely compilation of children's poems, to which Natalie Merchant has applied her incredible musical talent to create a score that appeals to both children and adults. While many of the tracks are lighthearted and fun, and all are safe for younger audiences, Merchant also brings out some of the subtly deep, powerful, and thought-provoking elements of her chosen poems.     I thought this album was delightful, and certainly a refreshing change from the usual. I am sure that most of those who love Natalie Merchant's musical style, and appreciate her poetic insight, will enjoy these CDs!
B001AQTWF2|3.0|I was really looking forward to this return of Whitney Houston.  I was disappointed.  I guess we've become used to the diva's ability to soar.  Throughout the album I kept anticipating that golden voice breaking through the clouds to take us up.  It never happened.  Don't get me wrong.  The album is pleasant but not extraordinary.  Million Dollar Bill, For the Lovers and Call You Tonight are fun tracks to take one down the highway.  But there is nothing on the album that touches Houston's former virtuosity.  My biggest disappointment was A Song For You.  When she started I said to myself, OK.  Now she will give us a real interpretation of this classic.  When it degenerated into a disco-type dance number, I gave up.  Has her voice been too abused?  Perhaps the register has been irrevocably lowered.  If this is the case, I think Whitney needs to rethink her material.  Perhaps a new singer will emerge from the ashes.  Whatever happens, hey girl, I will always love you.
0316044695|3.0|While I looked forward to getting a first hand account of Operation Redwing and was intrigued by Luttrell's journey, I couldn't help but be disappointed throughout this book as he put far too much effort into denigrating others and spinning the book into a conservative political rant.  By the end of the book I frustratingly came to the conclusion that Luttrell would prefer everyone to be a god fearing SEAL from Texas, otherwise they aren't worth spit.  This made the whole experience a frustrating read, yet politics aside the story of his team and journey is a fascinating one.  Luttrell is an American hero and his book is worth reading, but if you have half a brain you might want to skip around a bit.
B00005JO20|2.0|Clarification: I enjoy immensely most of Peter Jackson's material. The following does not discount that, merely points to the most in that statement.     Good points:    Peter Jackson directed it. Thus it has excellent use of the epic film style.   Beautiful actress to play the classic damsel in distress, with a solid acting performance to back it up.  For once, excellent serious acting on Jack Black's part.  Solid near flawless computer graphics for every scene requiring it.  Fantastic musical score that seamlessly fit into every scene.  Wonderful lighting.  Beautiful scenery.  Life-like visuals on the ape's part.    So, why 2 stars?    Bad points:    Should have been broken into three seperate movies, one entitled: \\"Before the Island\\", second entitled: \\"At the Island\\", third entitled: \\"After the Island\\". Each would have been a short, but still close to normal length film.  Editing was a serious problem with this film. Given full reign, Peter Jackson seems to not know the meaning of the word: concise. Rambling, repetative, beating the dead horse, chopping the wood after it is already sawdust, these are good analogies for this film. One bug scene was enough, thank you. Two was far past pushing it. Then to have the dinosaur smushing, then the three! T-Rex dinosaur fight with the big ape...and so on.  To clarify once more, I saw this in theatres. I finished my drink rather early on, thus at three hours and five minutes I was a little antsy and thought, I'll wait two more minutes, they should be done shooting the big ape then. Two minutes later, nopeallright havetoleave. Five minutes after that, afraid I had missed the end of this long, agonizing movie, I slipped back in the theatre and saw the planes still buzzing the big ape. I realize the creature is massive, but how many large caliber bullets does it take to knock this thing out?!     So, there you have it. A possibly wonderful movie, with excellent points all around, brought low by seriously bad editing. Then to find out that they extended it for the DVD!
B003JYOFIW|4.0|Good album or not, it's just so amazing to finally have a new Devo album after all these long years. Thankfully, it is indeed a good album. It's not their best work ever, but it's certainly better than Total Devo and Smooth Noodle Maps... and that's all I dared to wish for. It somehow sounds like classic Devo without actually sounding like any of their previous material. (One thing I keep going \\"Oo!\\" at is that Bob's guitar is so dominant in the mix, which almost hearkens back to the first two albums.) It's better than anything on the radio these days, and that's a fact. I'm getting a kick out of their new de-evolved corporate strategy, all of the market testing and whatnot. They didn't just get back together to slap together and spit out a new record; they're genuinely back with us in today's horribly de-evolved world. And it's fantastic. I only wish Alan Myers was back.<br /><br />EDIT: This morning I was listening to Sparks' Whomp That Sucker (1981) and was shocked at how similar some of it sounds to this new Devo. Check out the song 'Upstairs' to hear what I'm talking about.
B003H8WSLQ|5.0|Wow.  How to describe this album.  Much more thought out than the first.  More mellow at times.  Recognizable as Foals, but with a distinct air of cohesiveness and maturation that was not there before.  I'm struggling for comparisons...One thing I like is that the album seems to have been created as a whole album..all the tracks fit and create a sense of meaning to the work as a whole.  It's in the realm of a Talk Talk Spirit of Eden in terms of how all of the tracks fit together.  One possible signpost might be the new Jack Penate album...mines similar territory a bit.  great, great album that will stay with me for a while. Spiritual, deep lyrics too.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|I enjoyed it because I like Medievel and Renaissaince music. I also really love Stings' music-all of it!!!
B003ELOQCK|4.0|This is one of the best U2's dvd. Not as good as slane, but as great as Zoo TV. I think these are the top 3 U2 dvds.      Audio 5/5  Image 4/5 not really HD    Unlike the Elevation and Vertigo show, the editing is not annoying, I actually liked it a lot, gets 2 thumbs up!    If you a are a casual U2 you can't loose on this dvd.  For fans we get the 2 dvd pack, which is really cool.  For die hard fans, you get the $100 set.
B001GM28HO|5.0|This album has her hits and a variety of other songs. I really like it!
6305784116|5.0|I don't review movies very often.  Very, very rarely do I even watch a movie.  But I remember watching this movie when all my kids were little (we had rented it from a movie rental place).  I remembered that it was good, so I therefore recently bought it from Amazon, and just now got around to watching it.  I wanted to watch it with my little granddaughter (even though she's not old enough to care about it yet) and with my kids again, even though they are older.<br /><br />It is a cute little family cartoon movie.  It is the perfect movie to watch with your family.  It is only (I think) about an hour and fifteen minutes.  That is good for me, because I have a HARD time sitting through a movie.  Even this movie, as good as it was, and as short as it was, was hard for me to sit through.  I don't usually pick up on plots.  (I'd much rather be reading a book.)<br /><br />Anyway, this is a cute little cat movie.  I enjoyed it (even though it was hard for me to sit through.)  My little granddaughter was there.  When she gets older, if she likes movies, she can watch it again.  This movie was my movie quota for the next 5 or 10 years.  I probably won't watch another movie for at least another 10 years - or maybe never.  I am now going to my books.  If I don't get back to reading, I will go crazy . . .
0060853972|5.0|...because they somehow end up missing. I suspect some of my friends, but when it's such great book, I don't really mind much, and I just buy a new one. I'm just happy anyone else reads this masterpiece. Yes, it's a masterpiece.<br /><br />I read this a couple of years ago and it still stands in my mind as one of the funniest, most intelligent and downright awesome books I've ever read. It's a wonderful mix of the surreal adsurdities of T. Pratchett and the darker, strange and also absurd of N. Gaiman. It's one potent mix, I tell you.<br /><br />I won't bore you with a synopsis of it, seeing as so many reviewers probably already said it far better than I ever could.<br /><br />I will however tell you that this is the first book I always recommend to people interested in the Fantasy and Sci-Fi genre.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|This show is everything a show should be. The main theme good vs. evil so readily displayed in shows and movies today is shown somehow differently and more powerfully throughout the journey of these characters. When all hope is lost, they still manage to do what is best for the greater good instead of what is best for themselves. You could not have better role models than Richard, Kahlan, Zedd and Cara. It isn't a show that is easy to figure out so it plays on your intellect as well; finally something that helps your brain cells instead of killing them such as many reality tv shows do today. If that isn't enough, then add in romance, not poorly informed teens with sex drives,but adults who have to make tough decisions to put love over sex. If you aren't chopping at the bit yet to watch this show, then the wit of Cara, bonds of true friendship and the handsome/beautiful actors should tip the scale!I give this show two thumbs up and all five stars, everyone should watch this show because in the end it brings people together.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I do not watch tv - really. I own a little 13\\" one with a vcr to play exercise tapes. This show, however, compelled me to subscribe to the series on amazon. The seasons can be purchased in whole or by episode, I think. I am hooked on the story, and bought season 3. It is well worth $1.89 per week to watch on my laptop. The writers and actors have provided the most intriguing series ever!

B002S0OBMS|4.0|My review is nothing compared to the other reviews about the show. Most speak the truth so I dont want to repeat what they are already saying. yes they were helpful  I didn't like the idea of LND but as I listen to other versions of PotO, I realized that I was bashing this show too much just b/c of the idea. KNowing its a sequel to PotO based on one of the worse books that Ive  ever read, to me sounded disastrous. I know its supposed to be independent from the 1st phantom, so I then took the liberty of comparing it to other versions of phantom.  Man, I have no reason to criticize the LND  I listened to the other version called 'phantom' that was said to be better then alws. It wasn't, the music was horrible but it had the same idea.   So, Listening to various versions of phantom, I have to admit that LND was actually pretty good. I now felt more appreciative to ALWs composing in this show. *I was let down on other few shows by him*   I still hate that bathing beauty song. My ears bleed when I hear it.    I think what was odd about the show being based on PoM, you have to read it to understand why I was reluctant.  Apparently in the book, Giry said that raoul gets shot, down there, that prevented him from ever having kids. So it was proof that eriks had a son with christine.  Personally the book was more comical to me that I couldnt take it serious. So when I found out about the show, I questioned if that part would be in it.   The reason I changed my mine was b/c I Listened to a 'phantom phan reviewer' who played most of the other phantom shows and I was amazed how horrible they were. Same plot but horrible.  All in all if the show makes it, I may give it a chance and see it b/c seeing is believing.  Also in a ALW book about his show, he did say that the music in aspects of love were for poto.  Still if you feel you dont want to buy the cd, borrow it and copy it to your itunes or listen to it on youtube.       the minus 1 star is because I hate that Bathing beauty song.
B0012GVKVY|4.0|I actually wanted to give this movie only 3 stars but i'll give the Blu Ray 4 stars. This movie looks incredible in high definition. Most people have already seen this movie a million times. I would still go out and buy this one on blu ray. It is one of the best movies i have seen in the blu ray format. I will admit it is not one of my favorite movies. It's basically just Will Smith running around beating up robots. The story could have been a lot better. However, this is a movie everyone should own on blu-ray. It looks amazing and the story still has enough action to keep you glued to your seat. I give this one 2 ROBOT SLAMMMING THUMBS UP! Buy this one on blu ray now. HOLLA
0545140315|5.0|Be still me Beatle-maniac heart, I'm in love with a book.<br /><br />Why is this a super fab new release? Let me count the ways...<br /><br />1. The BEATLE-rific references.<br /><br />Hello, you know me, right? How could I not fall for lines like this:<br /><br />There was only one thing I could do to ease the pain. I turned to the only four guys who'd never let me down. The only four guys who'd never broken my heart .<br /><br />John, Paul, George, and Ringo.<br /><br />Yep, you had me right there, Ms. Eulberg.<br /><br />2. Contemporary Realism? Who, me?<br /><br />Let's face it. I usually prefer to throw realism out the window when it comes to YA novels. Give me a dash of magic and a smokin' hot supernatural love interest any day of the week.<br /><br />But Eulberg's book sucked me into a 100% vampire/angel/werewolf/fae/zombie/prophecy free world. And I loved it. The characters could have easily been teens I know  facing real life obstacles.<br /><br />3. Sweet premise, savory resolution.<br /><br />When Penny Lane gets her heart broken one too many times, she decides to swear off guys for good. She and her friends start The Lonely Hearts Club to affirm the bonds of friendship and the vow of self-preservation. These gals grow into a force to be reckoned with-they come to redefine themselves sans boyfriends.<br /><br />But...when a non-jerk works his way into Penny's heart, is the club doomed?<br /><br />The author resolves the plot without tying things up with a giant valentine bow. The ending is satisfying without becoming too sweet or too simple. It's just right. And thanks to a pitch perfect protagonist voice, I found myself thinking about Penny long after I'd turned the last page.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|This was not classic Bond it was better. The persona that Daniel Creg brings to the bond character makes James Bond more believable and more accessible.    This Bond knows his job and that's all that counts.  Of course there is a bit of vengance mixed in with his pursuit of the Bad Guys, but saving crown and country are upper most on his agenda.    If a few Bad Guys die along the way, so what they were causing problems anyway.  If Bond has to go off the reservation to accomplish his mission; then he gets a little Mavericky, the best M can do is hang on for the ride.  But she also knows that James will get results, and in the world of super spies that's all that counts.        Award worthy entertainment, a must watch film of the highest caliber.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|The Heartbreakers have evolved distinctly throughout their 30+ years of recording together. Listening to their catalog from the beginning to the present, one travels from an era of short, punchy garage-rock tunes in the 1970s, to the laid-back pop hits of the Jeff Lynne era, to their current period of meditative rock planted firmly in the band's primordial roots.    It's a natural progression, what with Petty's lament of modern music with the Last DJ in 2002, his efforts to keep '60s and '70s-era classic rock alive through his Buried Treasure radio show, the success of last year's Live Anthology, and a rapidly decentralizing music industry that's no longer ruled by the gatekeepers of Top 40 radio. It almost seems that Mojo just... had to be.    If Mudcrutch was Petty's country album, Mojo is his foray into blues recording (sprinkled with a little psychedelia and reggae to taste). Like Mudcrutch, Mojo is freewheeling, high-energy, and upbeat, and prone to a little jam session here and there -- which would have been unthinkable in the days of the neatly-trimmed Full Moon Fever or Into the Great Wide Open. Without a single bad song in the mix, Mojo is a cohesive album you can listen to from beginning to end.    Personally, I am digging latter-day Tom Petty. The band is as good as they've ever been, and each member seems to have increasing freedom to showcase their immense instrumental talents and unrivaled ability to complement one another. Mike Campbell's guitar is on fire through the whole album, and Scott Thurston breaks out of his shell with fine blues harmonica on several tracks.    As a departure from the past musical stylings that made the band successful, Mojo will certainly raise some eyebrows and not be to everyone's liking. Frankly, I think that's a good thing. These guys aren't trained monkeys paid to crank out the same songs over and over again. They're world-class musicians, and they deserve the chance to breathe a little. Play on, boys.
B002ZG997C|1.0|The moral that both my wife and I took away from this movie is that blind devotion to religious symbols (ie the bible in this case) makes people completely miss the point of said symbols (compassion, kindness to our fellow man etc.).<br /><br />In this well made, but morally disgusting, movie the main character refrains from helping people, even to the point of allowing a woman in one scene to be raped, in order to carry his precious religious tome to some people with a printing press.  He is so devoted to the physical object, and what it symbolizes, that he completely ignores the message therein.<br /><br />Further, he wantonly slaughters those who act aggressively toward him, again in the name of his religious zealotry.  What happened to \\"turn the other cheek\\"?  What happened to \\"thous shalt not kill\\"?  Those seem like pretty clear directives to me...but does this character, who supposedly has memorized the entire bible from slavishly reading and rereading it with little to no actual comprehension of it get these simple teachings?  No.  All these teachings conveniently vanish when faced with a threat to his shallow devotion to the symbol.  He even has the nerve to quote scripture AS he's killing.  Unbelievable.<br /><br />In short, as a depiction of hypocrisy and the dark side of religion, five stars!  As the writer and director inteded it, 0 stars for missing the point.
B000SEIDR0|3.0|I love Michael Pollan's writing and agree with so many of his ideas but I had to stop reading because I was developing food issues. I'm reading \\"In Defense of Food\\" instead.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|Bought this because our stroller does not have a tray or cup holder. This is one of the best things I ever bought and wish I had found it three years ago when we had our daughter. Fits cups of every size and has space for two with a zipper pocket for keys or cash. Good buy and very useful!
1595825045|5.0|If you ever wanted to know some of the things that went about in the making of Avatar: The Last Airbender animated series, then this book is for you.  Throughout the book you'll see sketches of characters, environments, animals, etc. not only that you'll get the creators including notes on the sketches.  They even explain about how some of the things came about for the show which I never knew some of the things that went on during the making of the show and blew me away with what I didn't know about this show.  If you think you know everything there is to know about ATLA, then you may not know without having a chance to look through such an amazing behind the scenes look at how this show came about even if it took a while before the show managed to get underway.  I give this show a nice 5 stars out of 5.
030726999X|5.0|Stop the presses! Darn, too late for this. It has been printed and it came out for sale last Tuesday! BIG PROBLEM! I do not know what to do next. When I'm reading it I'm in heaven but inexorably I'm getting close, to paraphrase the text, to the frigging end!<br /><br />I wanted to stop on pg 300 and write this review, now I'm on page 400+ and I cannot contain my excitement and the book has only about 150 more pages. Whoa to me, I'm crying, it has been very very long since I have read a book THIS good! (Doctorow's Billy Bathgate)<br /><br />Pg 374 more or less, only odd even pages are numbered. Exotic, no? So what  about Kungsgatan, Drottninggatan, Olof Pames Gata, Holl&auml;ndargatan, Helsing&ouml;rsgatan. It's me, Mariuxgatan writing Swedish I guess. An unremarkable dude from South Central L.A. not only traveling through Scandinavia (Its Helsinki the capital?) but living though all of these unbelievable alive characters!<br /><br />Man, I know that I'm going to miss them so much - why does this book - this trilogy - has to ever end? I feel that to be with them for the next and remaining 150 pages it's going to consume their tale. But what other choice do I have? Could I be strong enough to quit reading the book right now and console myself with a Louis L'Amour western where the woman are depicted as shallow and featureless as the heroine of this trilogy was supposed to be? Or with the latest book waiting for me on the edge of my bed table, the latest Grisham about this kid lawyer. Will this abate my upcoming suffering? The waxing separation pangs I have felt since pg 1 of this epochal work?<br /><br />Dragon tattooed girl was neither simple nor stupid. She once solved Fermat conjecture about cubed (or higher exponential) numbers and then she goes \\"Oh, I wish I had met this guy (Fermat) in person!\\"<br /><br />I was warned by serious book critics that this last book, The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest was not polished enough, that Stieg Larsson didn't have enough time to work on this latest gem before succumbing to a fatal heart attack due without doubt to an overdose of caffeine. Just to find that au contraire my chere ami, I'm inside the hornets spiral whirlwind, where we see all the aspects of a problem from the perspective of so many remarkable individuals, from a hospital janitor to the PM (Prime Minister) of Sweden. You move from one newspaper office to the police office and then to a monthly publication office, and then to the houses and the bedrooms of the people involved. I have never read a mystery novel that is dissected into so many aspects or characters.<br /><br />And to experience first hand the remarkable open sexuality in that country from the married woman who with her husband complete agreement has a lover with whom she can spend as many nights as she wishes with only one condition, that she would call her husband to tell him she won't be in that night so he won't worry about her? How do I wish I could find a lady companion so open minded myself?<br /><br />In fact this is the crux of the story in three not large enough books, the sexual and otherwise domination of young girls versus responsible open minded sex. The story how deep corruption goes to dominate and abuse young defenseless kids versus open responsible sex.<br /><br />Mr. Larsson I'll tell ya something, you have written a fantastic work, a story that is different than anything else we'll ever encounter in our lives. I just wish it wouldn't end, I just wish I wouldn't have to go back and read the remaining thin pages of your last book. How do I wish you haven't succumbed to your caffeine addiction and written your originally planed 10 books in the series!ng to a fatal heart attack due without doubt to an overdose of caffeine. Just to find that au contraire my chere ami, I'm inside the hornets spiral whirlwind, where we see all the aspects of a problem from the perspective of so many remarkable individuals, from a hospital janitor to the PM (Prime Minister) of Sweden. You move from one newspaper office to the police office and then to a monthly publication office, and then to the houses and the bedrooms of the people involved. I have never read a mystery novel that is dissected into so many aspects or characters.    And to experience first hand the remarkable open sexuality in that country from the married woman who with her husband complete agreement has a lover with whom she can spend as many nights as she wishes with only one condition, that she would call her husband to tell him she won't be in that night so he won't worry about her? How do I wish I could find a lady companion so open minded myself?    In fact this is the crux of the story in three not large enough books, the sexual and otherwise domination of young girls versus responsible open minded sex. The story how deep corruption goes to dominate and abuse young defenseless kids versus open responsible sex.    Mr. Larsson I'll tell ya something, you have written a fantastic work, a story that is different than anything else we'll ever encounter in our lives. I just wish it wouldn't end, I just wish I wouldn't have to go back and read the remaining thin pages of your last book. How do I wish you haven't succumbed to your caffeine addiction and written your originally planed 10 books in the series!
B001VPJYZK|1.0|I bought this item as a birthday gift for a friend who is a big fan. The disc was labeled \\"brand new\\" but it was so defective that it wouldn't play in his, mine, nor four other DVD players. Since it actually came from HOPELINE on Amazon marketplace, I don't know how to get the help I need replacing it because I still want to give the gift. Everything has gotten complicated when it should have been a no brainer.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I absolutely love this show!!! Lots of action, love, and drama. Every episode keeps getting better. Such great actors. I love Damon he's plays such a great role. Damon and Elena can't wait for season 2
B00005JPS8|5.0|this movie is awesome. iron man is one of my favorite superheroes. i love this movie. the origin of iron man is right on the spot. and the villain iron monger played by Jeff Bridges is awesome. hopefully in iron man 3 they will finaly introduce the mandarin. if you have not seen this movie than you should
193413712X|3.0|Just because a book wins a Pulitzer doesn't make it an enjoyable, challenging or informative read.  This book, \\"Tinkers,\\" may indicate an off-year for Pulitzers.    The idea, the concept, is good, perhaps even great, three generations, son, father, grandfather, and their final thoughts and emotions as they face death.    Good idea, but bulky and overwritten.The \\"heart\\" twist at the end, though it is a good one, can't overcome the problems and quirkiness of the book as a whole.    Finished it, but really didn't enjoy it.  That may say something, perhaps even to recommend the book in certain ways.  As hard as it was to read, as often as my mind wandered as I looked at the words, I did finish it.  It kept my attention and interest to that degree at least...but it was hard.    The ending is good, but don't peek. You won't understand it without reading the whole book.
B0018CWESK|5.0|This Movie is awesome. i love this film and all the characters in it. i hope they make a sequel. Van Helsing is a joy to watch so if you have not seen this movie than you should
B00003CX8Y|1.0|This review isn't guaging the quality of the movie it's (It's my favorite Disney film as a matter of fact) this is about the apparantly large amount of bootlegs that seem to be going around for this movie. This will probably sound like a broken record to those who have read the other reviews, but I want to caution you to use descretion when making your purchase. Upon excitedly recieving this item in the mail earlier today, I noticed that something seemed off about the packaging. I tested it with my DVD player, and found that the first disk didn't work properly (but did work for others. I instantly suspected bootlegging, and I went online in order to confirm my suspicians. Indeed, my copy fit all of the specifications of a bootlegged copy.    For your conveniance, heres a list of common features in bootleg copies of this film:    -Fuzzy or indistinguished art on cover, insert, and discs with unusally washed or light coloring (as if it were cheaply printed off). All artwork should be clean and crisp (as is to be expected from Disney)    -Discs only selectivly play, may work for some players, may not for others.    -Actual content on DVD's has similar qualities to packaging, with washed or overly light coloring and fuzzy picture.    -Movie may frequently skip or glitch.    -Inner ring of the discs underside (the side without the design) reads \\"Beaut and the Beast SPECIALEDITION disc 1\\" or \\"2\\" (Intentionally mispelled as printed on the disc). Disney has explicitly stated that they do not print the DVD's name in this location, and only have a barcode. This is the best way of confirming the legality of the product.    I have sent a message to the seller complaining about this, but I doubt I will get a reply. One thing I would advise though is to extensivly check the seller before buying, esspecially how many positive service reviews they have. Looking at this persons account I see he only has 4 positive reviews of four reviews. That should have been a bit a of a giveaway,but I didn't pay attention. I'm lucky though, I only payed $20 for this, some people got ripped off for as much as $50. Overall, very disappointed, and pretty miffed. I guess i'll just wait for the new addition coming out later this year.

B003JYOFIW|5.0|Alright, I've been a Devotee for something like 32 years. But let's not get straight to the heart of the matter. Where does this album fall in the scheme of all things Devo? The first 2 albums were guitar driven uber-nerd and quirky affairs. This is where I first fell for Devo. Freedom of Choice was where the boys had said they wanted to go - a keyboard driven band. Some fans were taken aback, was this a sellout? Yes and no. Devo if you recall had their own corporate anthem in 1979. They were always about pop culture and marketing. More on this below. So we embraced the new Devo. Then came New traditionalists. The first truly lateral step, but still good stuff this. Then came Oh No, It's Devo. Hmm. Love it or leave it, this was where fans began to rift. I still loved it. But alas, I fear the boys had run out of things to say - or perhaps we had really just caught up. Shout had its moments, but from here on the world seemed to be moving by. And so it passed.<br /><br />Now comes Devo 3.0. (we shall never speak of Devo 2.0). A sharply honed purpose driven, lean and hungry new Devo. A Devo with a plan. A Devo shaped and polished by the infamous Focus Group with 88% approval*. Not a \\"reimagining\\", nor a \\"reboot\\", this is Devo for 2010. Sarcastic, witty and angular - this is the Devo we've been waiting for a long, long time. They have something to say and songs to play with an energy I personally thought was lost. Remember, these are the guys that used to do jumping jacks on stage if they weren't doing anything else. And it sounds as if they could do it again!<br /><br />Will this create a whole new legion of Devotees? I don't know, but if you're new to Devo I'd say this is as good a starting point as any - and I never thought I'd say that about any \\"band reunion\\" album. The sound is the same in that you'd spot it a mile away, and yet has the vitality and strength of any newcomer. You'll hear Mark yelping as if it were 30 years ago. You'll hear spastic guitars. You'll hear wild and weird noises and samples.<br /><br />Personal listening impressions?  It's hard to rate or place it compared to previous efforts, but after tidbits like the Wipeouters and Jihad Jerry & the Evildoers I wasn't really prepared to be sucked in like this. Color me surprised. Okay, the album fades a bit in the second half, but not by much; similar to the way Freedom of Choice goes into a bit of cruise control on the second half. But if you're reading this, then just know you'll be sorry if you don't pick this beast up and set it spinning out of control. It has all the elements of the first 3 albums blended together in a foamy frothy mix; it sounds like what Shout should have been 26 years later. The fact that they chose to not include \\"Watch Us Work It\\" (the recent single from the Dell ads) speaks volumes (IMHO) of the quality of songwriting.<br /><br />In the end, it turns out Devo was simply pointing the way for us 30 years ago, and have been waiting for us to arrive; so here we are. Welcome home. See? We told you so.<br /><br />Another reviewer here mentioned not liking the album cover - it wasn't Dada enough. Devo was never really into Dadaism per se, it was all part of their marketing. Devo was ALWAYS about marketing, right after DNA modification that is. Look at the power dome. The Devo Corporate Anthem. No, the cover is about selling it. Gorgeous minimalistic lines, simple use of primary colors. Message received and understood.<br /><br />Don't you want some? Sure you do. It looks good doesn't it? Try a little, you'll like it. Mmmmm, tasty tasty Devo.<br /><br />-Update-<br />There seems to be some confusion on the CD content and song order, so here it is:<br />1) Fresh 2) What We Do 3) Please Baby Please 4) Don't Shoot (I'm A Man) 5) Mind Games 6) Human Rocket 7) Sumthin' 8) Step Up 9) Cameo 10) No Place Like Home 12) March On<br />Songs that didn't make the CD cut are available on MP3 or iTunes.<br /><br />Hope that helps!<br /><br />* Only 88% focusgroup approval because the song order was changed to \\"partnership approved\\" content, meaning Devo and/or WB decided the focus group wasn't entirely correct!, meaning Devo and/or WB decided the focus group wasn't entirely correct!
B002KD0OSS|5.0|I recently bought this record, after listening to all of Leonard Cohen's older records too many times to count,  I would have to say this is my favorite record that I own of his,  with haunting versions of his already released song's and also some off of songs of love and hate which was not released prior to this live performance.  With a beautiful twist on all of the previous songs, it shows Cohen at his best.  Definitely worth the forty dollar price tag.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Great acting and storyline. Definately worthy of owning and sharing with a friend/family member. Apocalyptic tale which dares to touch on faith in an entertaining and believable way. This hard hitting film is brutal and what you would expect in the aftermath of almost complete world anihilation. Although not a religious movie per se, it will appeal to those of us who are christian and follow the bible, not a small feat in todays hollywood. It delivers a clever justice to the antagonist that made me smile. Really tho, does Denzel do bad movies? I've yet to see one.
B0036JU6CY|3.0|This movie is not really a great kung-fu movie.  If you would like to know what I consider excellent martial arts, watch any of the fight scenes in the Matrix, Enter the Dragon, or even Only the Strong.  I suppose I'm a bit more sci-fi and contemporary than the average Kung-Fu fan but I still appreciate the art.<br /><br />Anyway - back to \\"Ninja Assassin.\\"  The main character's abilities are not grounded in any sort of reality.  He is capable of moving at what appears to be light-speed (from shadow to shadow), he can mend wounds in seconds, and generally has martial arts skills that rival... well, anyone.  Every time he gets going with his signature weapon (a curved dagger on the end of a chain whip) you can immediately tell that it's CGI.  Some fight scenes are so fast that you can't really tell who is doing what (which arm comes from which guy and so forth).<br /><br />The character development isn't that great either.  The movie tries to plug in a little human interest back-story about the main character's youthful days as an apprentice to a great master but ultimately you don't care about him as much as they want you to.  He also has very few lines.<br /><br />The female lead is also somewhat bland; she is a reporter who starts in on a story about the main character and his ancient ninja ways.  The acting is somewhat sub-par and you end up not really believing that the characters really care.  They even go as far as to point out that it's \\"ninjas\\" and who would really believe its ninjas in our society.  This concept in itself isn't so bad if the actors pull it off without a hitch - but in this movie they don't quite deliver.  This leaves you the watcher to feel somewhat like \\"If the actors don't believe in this then why am I getting invested?\\"<br /><br />All in all there were some good fights and a few very scinematic scenes so I give it 3 of 5 stars.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Loved it. I found it entertaining and intriguing till the end, which delivers an unsuspected twist. Top notch acting delivering a juicy tale. This is a movie I would watch again. A jewel definately worthy of owning. Perhaps even holds an Oscar nomination.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Great score, terrific voices, meaningful lyrics. With a couple of exceptions,n ot a score I would likely listen to, hum, or sing outloud repeatedly, such as Les Mis, South Pacific, Grease, Phantom, Cats, etc. Nevertheless, well done.
1594488843|5.0|In this book Daniel Pink does an outstanding job at arguing for the upgrade from the operating system Motivation 2.0 to Motivation 3.0. Pink definitely gets the conversation started about how to effectively run our business, schools, and organizations.  I don't know if all his methods are right but I do agree with a lot of them. Pink asks the question is our current carrot and stick operating system of Motivation 2.0 the best way to motivate people in our business, schools, and organizations?       About carrot and stick systems Pink wrote, \\"It suggested that, in the end, human beings aren't much different from horses--that the way to get us moving in the right direction is by dandling a crunchier carrot or wielding a sharper stick.\\" Pink feels that humans are naturally curious and want to work but the carrot and stick systems strangles people's creativity, motivation, and is bad for businesses in the long term. Pinks argument is backed with scientific research and many psychologists' analysis.    Pinks writing is filled with wit, humor, and great examples that makes reading this book enjoyable. If you are a part of a school, business, or organization please read this book. It well get the conversation started about how you can make your workers or students happier and more engaged with their work.

B002PAQETY|5.0|I was first introduced to Stereophonics when I heard \\"Have A Nice Day\\" way back in 2002 on David Letterman.  I've been hooked ever since.  This latest release is by far the most cohesive effort the band has done.  It's got a flow to it that, well, entices you to want to hear more!<br /><br />There are no fewer than at least 3 tracks that could really be added to any radio station playlist.  However, I doubt that this will happen.  Kelly Jones' history with the media might be the killer there.  Who cares!  Those of us whom are fans can still enjoy a band that offers something that is not cookie cutter, mainstream, too popish, yet it is with a style all it's own.  Even if they say Kelly Jones can't sing a lick (ever hear Bob Dylan.....jeeeish, what a voice but, yet it has a certain appeal.) I like his raspy somewhat nasal sound as it fits the music to a \\"T\\".<br /><br />With the release of, \\"Keep Calm and Carry On\\" Stereophonics have made a major leap in showcasing their talent for writing music and lyrics that hit home......And, thanks to Amazon for making it available too.  So far this is the best thing I have heard yet in 2010!
B003E48AYC|5.0|I love this movie! I am such a Wonderland fan. And the fact the Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are in it makes it that much better. =)

B0015AARJI|3.0|Someone at Sony had the brilliant plan to revamp the PlayStation Controller, which is one of the best console controllers I had ever seen in my 30+ years of gaming. It was an awesome controller until someone thought it would be great to cover the joysticks and the 4 trigger buttons with a frictionless surface that makes them very challenging to use or even touch. I don't have sweaty hands, but my fingertips are unable to find purchase on the slick shoulder buttons especially in a firefight online. Holding down R2 or L2 for longer then 10 seconds is extremely difficult if not impossible- the button always slips out from under my fingers! Didn't anyone at Sony notice how badly the controllers handled? Or is their QA so obsequious that it just didn't say anything?    Why did they do this? Was it to add challenge to the gamer by making it purposefully difficult to use the controller (and thereby lower game production costs), or was it to justify someone's ego? Yep, that's probably why. Some suit who equates \\"video games\\" with \\"space invaders\\" thought it might be forward thinking to put their fingerprints on a design, to make a change for the sake of making change. How very proactive.    My solution: covering the 4 shoulder buttons and the two joystick tops with masking tape. It looks very tore up, ghetto and post-apocalyptic, but it provides much more traction for the fingertips. Maybe the executives at Sony will successfully perform a cranial/posterior extraction before the PS4 ships :\    Other than the untouchable shoulder buttons, it's one of the best user input devices on the market.

B001EOOQF6|5.0|People People. RJD has now passed on through the Metal Gates. He was very proud of his work with Sabbath. Yes he did depart with the group over a dispute with Iommi over the LIVE EVIL album and had a successful solo career. But guess what? They reformed in later years and toured together as Heaven and Hell until his death. I have read a lot of reviews about Mob Rules and have to disagree with much of what is written. Take a moment and look at the cover art. Who or what do you think those beings are? If you would seriously listen to the album you would know. E5150 is a coded word. If you change the Arabic numerals to Roman numerals, it translates to the word EVIL. If you listen to E5150, you can feel the sadness and calamity that is reeling it's head toward mankind. The tension builds and then, something horrible happens. Perhaps a nuclear bomb followed by a haunting \\"YES,YES!\\" Whatever does happen, there's no time to figure it out. The intro riff to Mob Rules begins where Ronnie warns us to \\"Close the City and tell the people, that somethings coming to call. Death and Darkness are rushing foward. If you listen to fools, The Mob Rules!!!!! A Mob is defined as 'a large disorderly crowd'. This \\"Crowd\\" is the infected remnant of the disaster of E5150. They want to \\"TURN UP THE NIGHT\\". They don't practice voodoo, they are \\"VOODOO!\\". They give a \\"SIGN\\" and are \\"SLIPPING AWAY\\" from mankind. They want you to slip away also with them and will force you to \\"FALL OFF THE EDGE OF THE WORLD\\" too. I hope I've been helpful in explaining the concept of MOB RULES. If not, there's alway's HEAVEN AND HELL.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a great movie. It really is. What it shows us is the power of joining an caring heart and open mind. The movie tells the tale of how one family came to act upon their faith, and make another person's life better. The acting is great, the dialogue is great, and it was shot very well. It is a real pleasure to watch and will leave you wishing that it was not over. All in all, a very, very good movie. Get it and enjoy!
B00021R7CG|5.0|DVD arrived in excellent time and condition.  It is a real treat to watch a classic movie.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|The Black Keys are still rockin the blues.  I instantly enjoyed and loved this cd.  It has a little more production than the previous CDs but I don't think that detracts from the greatness.  the lyrics and music is as strong as ever.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|This movie definitely flew under the radar and I'm glad I rented it.  While it shares the post apocalyptic United States with The Road, this one is less dark and has more action (for better and worse).       Washington gives another strong performance and has grown tremendously as an actor (he was good early on but is fantastic now).      Highly recommend.
6301334345|1.0|I bought a used VHS that was in horrible condition I could not hear the movie most of the time and the picture moved up and down continually throughout the movie I did not like the movie it was way to much of a downer the history was good but the movie is really long I wish I did not but this movie it was a waste of my money
B003JYOFIW|5.0|This new disc is just jumping all over the place, I can't pick a favorite track, there all tight, the band sounds so energized, I can't believe I'm listening to a new DEVO collection, 2010, gee they<br />finally have arrived and not a min two soon. This music needs to get heard!, finally some new music arrives that has something to say and its so damn much fun and the vocals and sound production, wow... we haven't been here but a moment, NO PLACE LIKE HOME, this spells it out whats happening now,<br />thanks DEVO for kick'n this music up to the present, what a treat!
0060775858|5.0|A classic bedtime story loved by my daughters and, now, my granddaughter.  My most recent purchase was a copy for a friend who has trouble falling asleep.  :o)
0375842209|5.0|I have a general rule about books, especially in the summer: NO SAD STORIES.    I can't handle them. They make me, well, sad. I think about the characters and I get that feeling in the back of my jaw that I don't realize until later is tension until my face hurts. It's just a story, you might say, and I know that, but I'm a feeler. I'm IN the story.    And I might only have a few minutes while eating lunch after the kids have been sentenced to their rooms for quiet time; or those brief few minutes between climbing into bed at night and surrendering to 2-ton eyelids; or poolside, with one eye on the page and one on the water, periodically counting 1-2-3 little red heads. So generally I like to fill those minutes with easy, lighthearted quick reads.    For some reason I seem to have kind of totally forgotten my rule, lately.    Today I read the final pages of \\"The Book Thief,\\" by Markus Zusak. I mean come on, I knew what I was getting into - a book set in Nazi Germany. That's like looking at a version of Romeo and Juliet and wondering if they'll get a honeymoon this time. Please. Starting around fourth grade, I read a bunch of books about World War II, most about Jews in hiding or the death camps. I don't think I had ever read one from the viewpoint of someone actually in Germany. And never as if narrated by Death himself. Sounds like real light read, right? Riiiiiiiight.    And yet, this book grew on me, as I read. Some of these descriptions were the best I've ever tasted. I found myself rereading paragraphs and passages and savoring the combination of words and the style of delivery. I can't count the number of times I thought, \\"How did he write this book?!\\" And then shaking my head in wonder. There is absolutely no way this book could be made into a movie and still preserve the brilliant integrity of the story. I mean, it's DEATH talking.    Even though the narrative is laced with foreshadowing (and outright warning that things will not end well), I read on. It isa charming story. I loved these characters. REALLY loved them. And still I knew I would have to say goodbye. Goodbye as some died. Goodbye to the book as I finished it. Goodbye to SAD BOOKS.    \\"I hate sad books,\\" I thought as I read on and on, trying not to let the swim teachers see my emotion, snapping at my son when he tried to interrupt me to point out a bird. A bird? Dude, I've got Jews walking to Dachau and an old man trying to sneak them dried bread and air raids and Death telling me more will die and you think I'm interested in a stupid bird?!    Yes, I'm definitely done with sad books. But good books! Read this book - it's like going out to eat at some new restaurant and ordering all new food and realizing, with surprise, that you actually quite enjoyed it. Except I don't think I've ever cried over food...

0618918248|3.0|First of all, I do want to say that I have nothing against Dawkins. He is spewing the right type of message; that we need to stop following ancient 5,000 year old texts and dogmas.    The real problem I have is that he wishes to change people into atheists, rather than try and encourage people to try and prove there is a God. He bashes a lot of communities. I personally am not a Christian or a Jew, Muslim, yadda yadda yadda. In my book (that can be found on Amazon) \\"Were Ancient Gods From Other Planets?\\", I show, like von Daniken, that the ancient texts of our day are really extra terrestrial activities (read my book to find out more, compelling stuff).     The real qualm I have with Dawkins is that he would rather have people believing that when they die then its over, rather than having hope of believing that there is something to shoot for. If everyone believes we just die and thats it, then we have the feeling that no one is looking over our shoulders (God) and that creates anarchy.     3/5. An interesting book, but the basis in which it is written on is a bit egocentric.
B000002KNU|5.0|What an awesome, exhilarating debut album!  Every song is great, not a clunker in the bunch.  This is actually my favorite talking Heads album; some of their later albums tend to sound kind of sterile to me, but this record has soul, hooks and a punky New York attitude that won't wait.
B001EO2UJK|2.0|I give two stars for the clarity but, it's been said before, in these mixes there's only one volume for every instrument: LOUD. For example on Foxtrot. The soundlevel of the solo acoustic guitar at the very beginning of Horizons is as loud as the full blown ending of \\"Can utility and the coastliners\\" which precedes it.     And where's the ripping sound of the castration on The colony of Slippermen which should be there between 4.00 and 4.15 minutes? Pure censorship.
0802130208|3.0|I give this book 3.5 stars.<br /><br />Beautifully drawn characters. Lovely writing. Great ideas. I found the story a little bogged down in the middle and almost gave up on it a few times. I persevered but never really got the same high I got when reading the first few chapters. As believable as I found the characters, towards the end, I felt hyper-aware of what the author was trying to do structurally and unfortunately for me this catapulted me out of Iganatius' world and into my own.<br /><br />I think this would work beautifully as a film or serial.<br /><br />And despite my star rating, I think it is a book worth reading.
0316287059|5.0|This book really shows you the tricks to applying makeup to maximize your features, and cover and hide your flaws.. The comparison pictures show it all.. Easy to follow, very informative! A definate must buy!
0385504225|3.0|The story kept me interested but he was quite repetitive. Yes, we got it, 33 is an important number, the masons are misunderstood people, etc etc. The last 50 pages were a snoozefest. I have read all his books and this one is definitely my least favorite. Oh well, maybe his next one will be better.
0061537969|3.0|This was a lovely read - highly emotional, with quick paced doses of love, devotion, courage, injustice, rage and perseverance.  Events unfold through the narrative of a dying dog, completely humanized with a range of interests including watching TV, movie commentary and car racing.  Life-as-auto-speed-race metaphor runs through the book, a metaphor mostly wasted on me but of probable enjoyment for racing fans.  The dog-narrator Enzo shares his occasional politically-correct opinion and uses quite crude descriptions at times, both of which detract from the story flow.  Still, the book's a quick and entertaining read and good emotion jerker - I did snarl along with Enzo at the evil things and found myself dabbing my eyes at the end.

What it most certainly is, however, is entertaining and inventive.<br /><br />The movie starts about 200 years from now with the launch of a ship named \\"Elysium\\" which, at the beginning of the film, has a mission that is not clearly revealed to the viewer and can only be guessed at.  (The mission will be discovered by the two flight-crew members [Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid] who awake from hypersleep to find a ship with many things amiss.)  Key to the story is the fact that hypersleep causes extreme forgetfulness and is achieved by pumping chemicals through a person's body.  That's all I'll say lest I head deep into the heart of Spoilerville.<br /><br />There's a lot going on in \\"Pandorum\\" and, for the most part, the screenwriting, direction and acting get high marks.  One character encountered mid-way through the movie seems to know quite a bit more than he realistically should and seems like an expositional plant placed in the story to explain certain aspects of the film's mystery.  Production values are very good.<br /><br />Of course, there's the suspension of disbelief I had to make with regard to many characters on the ship.  Specifically, I think most people would act more like Bill Paxton's character from \\"Alien.\\"  They would wail, cower in fear, wet their pants, find a hiding spot and stay there (starving to death rather than suffering the alternative), and possibly commit suicide (not that Paxton's character does all those things, mind you).<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1416562605|4.0|Even though I would love to see the historic temples & forts of Rajahstan, I have never really wanted to go to India because of the poverty, dirt, & heat.  This novel is written from the point of view of one man who lives in that non-touristic India which I do not want to see.  The poverty & filth in the book is tangible, yet I couldn't put the book down; the descriptions are necessary to understanding the character's motivations as he climbs from poverty & subservience to freedom & entrepreneurial wealth.  This portrait of life in contemporary India fleshes out the stories in business magazines about India's economic miracle.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|When you see Season 1, you think, \\"Wow, that was good.  There's no way Season 2 could top that or be that good.\\"  Then you see Season 2 and you think, \\"Incredible.  But with all that stuff and all those characters gone from Seasons 1 and 2, there's nothing left to write about.  Season 3 is going to stink and the show's gonna fizzle.\\"  Then you see Season 3 and you're dumbfounded at how this show is able to maintain it's originality and quality. I was.<br /><br />I won't spoil Seasons 1, 2 or 3 for anyone by revealing specific plot points, but in Season 3, there's a new killer in town that must be dealt with and, of course, he/she/it and Dexter cross paths.  In additon, Dexter makes a good friend (his first) and explores his father's code.<br /><br />Dexter's sister, however, is still somewhat annoying.  Likeable, perhaps, but annoying.<br /><br />Michael C. Hall continues to impress.
0143036556|5.0|The problem with reading a 500+ pp book is that you have to write a review that \\"gets it all in.\\"<br /><br />But here we go.<br /><br />Jared Diamond's Collapse (2005) is an excellent book and worth reading. That's particularly true because of the subtitle: \\"How societies choose to fail or survive.\\"<br /><br />Every day on this blog, I talk about economics and politics. I talk about things that we are choosing to do, not the things that Nature does to us, but what we do once Nature has moved. That makes this book particularly relevant.<br /><br />Right, so we get: Wait, I see that the wikipedia article summarizes the book. Great. Go see that for thesis and structure.<br /><br />The main point is that humans -- in terms of population -- have often overwhelmed their environment, until an end of abundance (get it?) leads to collapse. Well, he doesn't say \\"end of abundance\\" (in those words), but that's the jist.<br /><br />Diamond makes the point that this need not happen. We can change our habits to head off the collapse. My favorite example of voluntary destruction took place in Greenland, where the Norse settlers (vikings!) kept to their sheep and cows, ignoring the fish and seals that were nearby. They starved (turning to cannibalism in the end) while the Inuit nearby just cruised along. Strange that they preferred to die like Norsemen than live, but that's what some people do, when they stick to old habits, like...<br /><br />  * Driving cars everywhere<br />  * Water lawns in the desert<br />  * Eating meat<br />  * Overfishing<br />  * Diverting streams<br /><br />You see the point, or was I too subtle?<br /><br />Here's another obvious one. The inhabitants in Chaco Canyon (present day New Mexico) left because of a drought, but they were vulnerable because they pushed the water resources to the limit, to the point where there was no safety margin left. Sound familiar?<br /><br />Some people killed in the Rwandan genocide were killed for land (Hutu-Hutu killings), and that was because the land resources were too meager for the population.<br /><br />Australians over-exploited their land because they paid prices that were proportionate to land of a similar productivity in England. The trouble was that their new land was NOT that productive. Given their purchase prices, they had to work the land hard (high sheep density, etc.), which led to it deteriorating rapidly. They should have paid less -- in proportion to real and sustainable productivity -- and they wouldn't have depleted it.<br /><br />Today, \\"80 percent of Australian agricultural profits come from 0.8% of Australia's land\\" (p 413). That number is astonishing. If true (James? James! Tell us!), it implies that 99 percent of Aussie agriculture is losing money. I reckon that if half of that shut down, the other half might make a profit...<br /><br />\\"Of the 80 claims of `for every tree felled, two are planted' [by wood companies] 77 were unsubstantiated, 3 could be partially substantiated, and nearly all were withdrawn when challenged\\" (pp 472-3). That was for wood being marketed in the US. China, Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia? Fuggetaboutit!<br /><br />Australia (in the chapter is called \\"mining Australia\\") has a deforestation problem, but they cut trees, grind them into chips and export those to Japan, which has PLENTY of forests. The Japanaese process Aussie chips into paper that they sell back to Australia at a 2500% markup. I'd call that neo-colonialism, but I'd be wrong. It's Aussie government policy that allows plantation farming.<br /><br />The best way to get change is to hit the company in their PR. Want to end \\"Blood diamonds\\"? Boycott DeBeers, not Sierra Leone. Want to stop deforestation? Boycott Ikea, not Indonesia. DeBeers and Ikea have done a LOT more to protect market share than these corrupt governments (of corrupt people) will ever do. Thank god for market power!<br /><br />We, 7 billion humans, are NOT going to achieve First World living standards. Therewill NOT be a SUV in every driveway, a flat screen on every-wall and a porterhouse steak on every barbie. The earth's resources (and environment!) are not sufficient. Things will cost more (resources) or run out (environment) before we get to that standard. Time to go for smaller is better in developed countries and population control in developing countries.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I give this book FIVE STARS. I recommend that anyone interested in sustainability, environment, resources, food, and/or public policy read it. Everyone else should as well. We need to understand patterns of failure and prevent them from happening to us. We're already in the middle of many failures, but it's never too late to stop failing.environment!) are not sufficient.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I was woefully out of shape when I bought this DVD. This video is perfection for anyone who wants to get in shape and needs a short but effective routine to do each day. I had been watching \\"The Biggest Loser\\" on TV, and wanted to workout, but never found a routine I could stick to until I found Jillian's 30 Day Shred. The DVD has three 20 minute exercises. They are fast moving, intense, and you will love it! You start at Level 1, and then after 30 days you move to Level 2, and so on. I never expected dramatic results because I didn't believe it could happen while doing a 20 minute workout each day, but the results ARE dramatic and they ARE real. It has changed my life more than I could have believed. I feel awesome!<br /><br />When I started Level 1, I couldn't even do the warm-ups without getting tired and sore. After the first day, my legs were extremely sore, but I stuck with it and continued to workout through the sore time. Your body doesn't start building muscle until 4-6 weeks into a strengthening routine so I didn't expect results until then, but I was really happy to discover that I felt incredibly stronger after 6-7 days of doing the workout even though I wasn't losing weight or gaining muscle.<br /><br />Once you hit the 6 week mark, and have completed the first 30 Days, you will feel amazingly different. You will feel toned, strong, and confident. I only lost 1 pound after 30 days, but I lost 2 inches off my waist. It felt good to feel my pants fit loosly after 6 weeks of this video. I am currently doing Level 2 and I am on day 40 of the 30 Day Shred. My abs are getting tight, my legs and arms are tight, and I just gotta burn off the belly fat with my newly built muscle. There is literally nothing to compare to this workout DVD. You can't get better results in 20 minutes doing anything else including running, swimming, and biking. This is the best all body workout you can do in 20 minutes. Hands down.<br /><br />I have read some reviews where people are concerned about the high impact on the knees. My recommendation is to do the modified versions of the workout by following the girl on the right, and then once you're knees have gotten stronger, move to doing advanced version. If you feel any pain at all, stop, and adjust your movement so you don't feel anymore pain. You can still workout without straining the knees. Do what Jillian says in the video, and take it easy. I was very careful not to strain my knees during the workout, and they've gotten stronger over time so I can stand higher impact moves like jumping up and down. Make sure you have good shoes!<br /><br />Some reviewers have commented about Jillian's personality, and all I can say is that I love that she is so real and encouraging. Her que-ing is right on because just about the time when you feel like you can't do any more, she pushes you to do it with a balance of encouragement and camaraderie. Anyone who is bothered by her no nonsense approach to exercise has personal issues because Jillian is genuine and a great coach. She jokingly condescends but you can tell that she loves what she does and she wants results from you.gh impact on the knees.

B003E48AYC|5.0|This movie was excellent.I'm not a fan of everything Tim Burton creates but in this case it's amazing. Just watch the DVD extras to get an idea just how much effort went into creating AIW.I'm not sure if Disney had this version of Wonderland in mind when they gave this project to Burton.Maybe Disney wanted a live version of their animated Alice in Wonderland,like they did with 101 Dalmations.Regardless,this version of AIW has been given a dark,adult edge.(At least as much as could get by Disney's censors.)The White and Red Queen drop a number of subtle hints as to the VERY adult goings-on in Wonderland. Fortunately, most of those won't spoil the beauty of this movie. What an excellent idea to give Christopher Lee the speaking role of the Jabberwock,even if it's only 3 of 4 lines.Just imagine a version of Wonderland created by Tim Burton & American McGee(of the Alice PC game),hmmmm.

B002ZG99CC|2.0|I really wished there was a remote control to fast forward many boring scenes in this remake. If you have seen Kick-Ass and Ip Man (2008), Karate Kid (2010) would be even BIGGER disppointment!    Kick-Ass' FUN FACTOR completely kicked KK's ass. Like The Incredibles (2004), I just wished Kick-Ass would continue playing another 2 hours or longer, it was a breeze, whereas, I can't wait for KK to end!    Like another reviewer said, \\"Seeing an 11-year-old Jaden kiss that 15-year-old Chinese girl (she looks 15 or older) is at best - weird.\\"    And in terms of kungfu, KK is like kindergarten stuff compared to Ip Man's (2008).    KK has way too many boring scenes and ALL the action scenes are not great, if I knew better, I would have waited for the TV premiere.
B00026ZG10|5.0|Don't ask this film to be subtle. One more film against the jihad danger from Moslem Arabs with many greedy intermediaries in our beautiful western world. An atom bomb is worth a lot on the black market of military equipment. But the film is funny because Cameron makes it so. Schwarzenegger can come out of a frozen lake in a wetsuit but when he gets the wet suit off you can be sure his tuxedo and bow tie underneath are absolutely neatly pressed as well as if they were coming out of the Chinese laundry shop round the corner in Chinatown in San Francisco. There are so many incongruities, over-killings, a horse in a lift, a motorbike jumping from the roof of a skyscraper directly into the swimming pool on top of the next sky-scraper, etc. Luckily the horse is not insane that is forced to run after the motorbike: it refuses to jump and throws our dear Schwarzenegger over who manages to hold the reins and to make the horse back up and save his skin from a very deep fall. That's the only interest of that film. Extreme impossibility. But the last tango in Switzerland is a good mopping exercise with Swarzie's wife being dragged on the floor as if she were the mop mopping it. I just wonder what his vision of a bullfight would be: sweeping the arena with the dead bull? So enjoy the laugh and forget the narrow-minded political discourse that is just proved dumb by the extreme excess of the film, the plot, etc.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID
0307346617|2.0|I guess I'm in the majority, but I really didn't like this book.  I couldn't even finish it.  The style of the book is written in various accounts, but it isn't accounts integrated in to the story...it's just account after account after account.  It's not seamless and I just couldn't get in to it.
B00008WT5E|5.0|Simply put this is the best Bon era ACDC cd you can buy.  Lets face it - they are all great, but for me this one has it.  Sin City? 'nuff said. Gimme a bullet?  Classic with a K. Downpayment Blues? ditto. Rock 'N Roll Damnation?  Get in. They are all totally killer.  This was my first ACDC album, on vinyl, and I took a chance that has been re-payed a thousand times over.  If you are touching a toe in the Pre Johnno 'DC water then this is the one to try. Trust me...I am certainly not  a doctorrrrr... and even Keith Richards agrees with me!  Or was it Cliff...

My favorite is the song with Fergie She has such a strong voice and was totally unexpected also the song with Lemmy was Great. There is not a song on the album that I don't love...
B001AP11KW|5.0|This album makes me feel like a kid just discovering rock-n-roll. Each song is well crafted. When I was sixteen and had my first car, Led Zeppelin II was in the deck on auto-reverse for months. Now the tunes are on an iPod, I'm old and wrinkled, but I don't feel it driving along and grooving to Jack White and company.  Heavy influences of Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, and other assorted guitar gods you'll be trying to remember as the next song grows on you.

B00003CX8N|4.0|Every once in a while, I watch a movie that I have no knowledge of and I've seen no recommendations or reviews. Sometimes it's a fun thing to do. In this case, my wife's mother left a DVD of \\"84 Charing Cross Road\\" (starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins) for us to watch. It's a rather unusual movie. Very old fashioned, I'd say. It's a love story (or at least friendship story) and it involves no sex, violence, passion or things like that. A lady writer and book collector from New York City contacts a book shop owner from London seeking copies of used books. He replies, sends books, and a long-term correspondence begins and runs for several decades. A friendship develops based on a mutual love of books. They become close, exchange gifts, but never meet one another face to face. Interesting story. Somewhat sad, but uplifting at the same time.<br /><br />The movie is well done. The acting is excellent, The New York and London scenes are excellent. My only gripe would be in the formatting. It's put together for the old-fashioned TV set, not the more modern wide screen models. I guess it really doesn't matter that much in that practically all of the movie dwells on shots of individuals. So, how would I rate it? Perhaps 3.5 might be appropriate. Since I can't give a 3.5, I'll round it up to 4. It's an interesting film. Would I recommend it to friends? Perhaps, if they were book lovers. Would I watch it again at some future date? No.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

1572814349|5.0|The artwork in this deck is one of the most beautiful I have seen in a deck. The imagery and symbolism in each illustration helps you understand the meaning of each card. The book that accompanies the deck is helpful. Also, it all fits in a cute little box!
030745455X|1.0|I cannot believe an editor would permit this book to be published. At least 300 pages from the middle of the book could have been capsulized in a couple of paragraphs at most. How many times can we read the same information being discussed by a different set of characters or even the same characters. I cannot imagine why this book is so beloved by so many. I think a good book could be written with the storyline that all who have read this book have gone into a coma by page 400. Now someone use that as a plot line and write an exciting thriller.
0060765488|5.0|I love this series. Loved it even more when I read it as a fourth-grader, delightfully unconcerned with the Christian symbolism, not that it really mattered. My best friend Mark introduced them to me; he truly believed Narnia existed, and come to think of it, how do we know it doesn't? Even now in my 40s, I just don't think the overt symbolism matters much. For me and many others, these books represent a time in our lives when we could willingly suspend our disbelief easily, readily, wholeheartedly. Isn't it sad that, as we age, we often seem to lose that flexibility, that openness?

I can't count the times I've been on the verge of criticizing or ridiculing someone when I feel Atticus Finch tapping on my shoulder: \\"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, ...until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.\\"     Thank God for Harper Lee and her beautiful masterpiece.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|I have loved this movie ever since I was a kid, laughing at all of the funny things that happened to the characters. After watching it at my age now (early 20s) I get more of the jokes and it's even better. I'm glad to own this on DVD and it is widescreen (at least on my Mac Laptop) plus there are behind the scenes features. Favorite, favorite favorite movie of my childhood.
0143034901|4.0|Another monumental book, full of colorful richness and amazing depth. I realize a reader loses the artistic nuances of the original language when he or she reads a translation, but if translator Lucia Graves' remarkable accomplishment is this breathtaking, just imagine the grandeur, the silent wash of beauty that must envelope the reader who is fortunate enough to encounter the original Spanish.<br /><br />One really hates to bid farewell to a book like this.

1416955070|4.0|What a delight to read this treasure after the disappointing \\"Twilight\\" series. Not overly brooding, the book is sharp, contemporary, and edgy enough to appeal to a wider audience than the young adult/teen fantasy fans its cover seems to be beckoning. Its gritty in-your-face stance is a nice departure from \\"Twilight's\\" silly, prolonged bait-and-switch Pollyanna tease-fest. Since I seem unable to stop bashing \\"Twilight,\\" I have to share Stephenie (with an \\"e\\") Meyer's endorsement emblazoned across the \\"City of Bones\\" cover: \\"The Mortal Instruments series is a story world that I love to live in.\\"     Uhh, Stephenie, you couldn't come up with something better than that?! Had you been in my Freshman Comp class way back when, that blurb would've garnered you a low C at best.     Anyhoo, check out \\"City of Bones,\\" especially if you're looking for some clever, meaty, character-driven young adult fiction.
