My new favorite band!  This album will make you a fan instantly.  I will definitely recommend this album to anyone that has ears!  See for yourself!
B008Q0AJA2|4.0|I love everything psychological it just makes you look at things differently. Anything with Jim Carry in it is awesome!

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is great! It forces you to pay attention and think about every move you make. Definitely worth it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was addicting.  Every time you put it down you couldn't wait to pick it up again. It was exciting and there were many cliff hangers throughout the book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another great read! I cannot wait for the next book in this series! Not sure about the ending, but just has me anxiously awaiting the next!
B00BBIAB0Y|5.0|Well it looks like I'm going to spend a lot of money for these books.  I'm hooked and you will be to.

034580404X|5.0|It was more than I expected. I couldn't wait to finish one book to continue the story with the next one. It was well written and always stayed with the storyline.I would read more of the same stories.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I can't stop playing it OMG but I'm trying to see if I can play wit my friends and beat them
B0078XFYDA|2.0|The book is great.  I have the hard-bound version.  The Kindle version is terrible because it leaves out all pictures.
B00BK3MSME|4.0|I wish that Madeliene Peyroux would make more albums. Her voice is exquisite; something in the tone speaks to me. I enjoy both the songs she writes and the songs she covers. This album is covers, and some of the choices at first don't seem to suit her style (Bye Bye Love and Gentle on My Mind were two I wondered about). But she does her magic with them; they are hers.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I got the Feedly app to replace Google Reader and have been very impressed. It's easy to set up favorite categories,  mark entire sections as read, save favorites, and share reads via social media. Feedly is now my must read every day.
B008GBCMHO|5.0|We bought this for our long journey to Disney World.  The kids hadn't ever seen it before and were immediately thrilled with the antics of the cats.  They must have watched it 3 or 4 different times.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|first of all I highly disagree with those of those of you who rated this book three stars or less. second of all as you may already tell this is the first series that i ever  read. third of all this is  definitly the best book I ever read.
B0060CXSR4|3.0|First of all, the kids loved this; however, the writers took a lot of liberty with the story - changing Pocahontas' age, John Smith's background, etc.  I would prefer that the story represented more of the actual story.  It changes history as kids rely on the show for what is true rather than looking back at historical documents.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is fun and exciting. Keeps me interested and it's really challenging!  Great way to pass the time waiting for appointments.
0307352153|5.0|The world is missing the talents of the 20% to 30% introverts and their ways of thinking; especially informative for introverts who live with extroverts.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I've watched this series some 5 times now.  I've learned so much -- history, social mores, the class distinctions, even issues such as eclampsia.  I got pregnant and didn't know about the dangers???<br /><br />And, the acting is superb.  My favorite is Maggie Smith (hard to top her).  I re-run particularly effective scenes and watch how she carefully creates her character.  My absolute favorite scene is where she discovers from Cora that the story about Mary and the Turkish fellow is true.  Oh, please... to be able to act like that!  She's a wizard.<br /><br />If you've not watched this series, you're really &#34;missing it.&#34;  Never let it be said the Brits have never done us any favors!  They gave us Downton Abbey to enjoy!<br /><br />Arwen
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I read most ebooks on my phone now.  Great product, very handy.  Also, easy to download and get started reading.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|the best free game, several people play this game where I work, and everyone agrees that this is a very cool game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A little on the easy side but a nice little time waster and well worth the download!  Hopefully it will get a bit more challenging otherwise I fear it will rehash and get repetitive.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This offering had a great mix of set-up to the Avengers Initiative to its climactic end! Robert Downy's tight wit and Scarlett Johanssen in anything tight is a perfect combo.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King is a master storyteller.  This book held me riveted from page one with great characters and terrific writing.  King builds his setting brilliantly, and everything feels real as you're reading it--yes, even the ghost.  If you're looking for a fun book to entertain you for an afternoon, you've found it.  Buy this, read it, and travel back to the early 70s for a bit of mystery, and characters you can care about.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Easy to use. Clean appearance and no interface issues. would recommend to all who want a quick and easy battery status summary.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|I use it to write myself notes and keep track of information that I used to write down on little pireces of paper and either couldn't find later or couldn't decipher. Now I write a note and it has a date and subject and is legible and I can go back later and add to.
B00D8OHPF8|3.0|Joe is a consistent artist, and a solid album is what I always expect from him. Same Joe, no fillers, and that is a good thing!
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Amazing concept, excellent artwork, challenging yet still completable. Suitable for religious or non-religious people all alike! Keep up the good work!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved this book.  Too much fighting in the first two so all the love and kindness in this one was a great change.  So many new twists and turns to come too.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I liked the movie - great to watch on summer vacation.  I wish they would have had more of the dads as they are the best part of the film!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Definitely Watch this show. It is fantastically frustrating. Just when you think they can't surprise you anymore.... Wham!! Totally hooked.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|Different twist to a zombie plot eating brain gives the zombies memories funny funny funny and the zombie that collects junk and listen to records not a bad movie love with killer zombies
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I loved this game at first until the missions started requiring you to bug everyone you know on Facebook. I am not on Facebook and I have no desire to be, and I really hate when apps penalize you for not logging on to Facebook! There is the option to buy out of these missions, but coins are really few and far between in the game unless you buy them. It's a shame, it really is a cool app.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />With the update of this app, it seems to be much less Facebook-focused and the goals are actually achievable now without Facebook! Gave it two more stars. Also, the new level is really cool.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this show about a very smart guy with a photographic memory who can read any book and understand it.  Then he becomes a lawyer in a big firm.  Pretty good con game here. Or lawyers are all liers and can't be trusted.....
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Not all that interesting.  There are more challenging games out there.  I would not download it again.  Would be better for a child not an adult.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Inspiring and unique, great music, would love to hear more, are they planning a new CD? Hope so much more
B002JVWR4U|4.0|No not quite, but its certainly not close to the worst.  I liked the series pretty well and was happy to get this boxset to watch at my convenience.  I am surprised this series is not more popular on streaming services.
B00BESNKB8|3.0|This was pretty good had a decent sense of humor.  The acting seemed a little stiff but pretty OK action sequences.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|THE best series on tele, bar none!  You won't be able to tear yourself away from watching all 3 seasons in a row!  Can't wait till September '13 for Season 4!
B002NNA9N0|4.0|It was a treat to watch the master-actors in this story.  It took a while to &#34;get into it,&#34; but it was worth it.  Al Pacino was outstanding, as usual, and very funny.  The others were excellent as well, and it was an enjoyable film.
B00BZAJMWG|4.0|Good movie, a little of a rough start but gets much better as it progresses.  Really good acting jennefer was stunning no wonder she got an award for it.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|Lousy script.  You'd have to be hung over to enjoy it.  Every other phrase begain with Fthis, Fthat.  What was the writer thinking.  I was so disgusted with the foul language and lack of comedy until I didn't even try to stay awake.  Go and see &#34;The WhiteHouse&#34; with Jamie Foxx.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Ok, so this book was amazing. TBH, I really liked it, but didn't *love* it until the last 40% or so. By the end of the book, I felt like I was right there, living the life and breathing the air. I love all the characters. I think I would have loved it from the very start if it wasn't for such an awful forward by Anna Quindlen. So I would recommend NOT reading that if you are reading the book. It gives away too much and says something (I won't repeat it in case someone has NOT read this wonderful book) that makes you think less of the book before you have even read it.<br /><br />This book reminds us what is so great about America. How far we have came over the last 100 years. Sadly enough it reminds us as well of what is wrong with this Country and how far we still have to go. I think these types of books are what should be required reading in our schools. Not \\"animal farm\\" and \\"the lord of the flies\\". That's my opinion and I'm entitled to it...just as you are free to disagree with me :-)
B0013ND30W|5.0|bringing me back from my childhood and the countless trips to Disney!  What a great movie-you need to see this movie!
030758836X|5.0|I LOVED LOVED LOVED this book! Oh, did I mention how much I LOVED this book? I don't want to scare anyone, but I saw a lot of myself in some of these characters. Then they just kept getting more and more depraved. Still at the end, even with all of the insane evilness of them, I still see a lot of truth in what was being said. About marriage. About how we take one another for granted. About how you can choose to try in a relationship, or you can choose to walk away. I especially loved how, the more messed up one got, the more the other one couldn't let go. The more they fell back in love with one another....It was amazing to see it happening, and honestly, it was very believable. Amy was kinda off the charts evil and at times hard to believe, but how she chose to believe what she wanted to believe in Nick and him choosing to believe what he wanted to believe in her...well it was very believable. A true co dependence if I have ever seen one! This is like \\"War of The Roses\\" and \\"Fatal Attraction\\" rolled up into one and on speed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait to read more from Gillian Flynn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hot dang, what a story!!!!!!!!
B001AIRUP4|5.0|movie by my fiancé Jazmine.  She asked me if I ever saw this movie.  When she heard that I had never seen it, she brought over her copy and I was hooked! I went out and bought the Blu-ray version.  This is a must for any Disney fan.
159463176X|4.0|This is hard one to review. This book is broken into 9 chapters. All of them are lengthy...some of them are LONG.....They are told by different characters of the novel. They go back in history and forward in history....I have to say, chapters 1 - 4....they were....pure bliss for me....I loved every single word of them. I think I've reread the first two chapters 3 times each already. Chapters three and four have been scanned over multiply times....These chapters had everything I look for in writing. Mystery. Fables. Devotion. Regret. Heartache. Betrayal. Hopelessness. and a beauty that simply made me ache inside....I honestly found it hard to move beyond to the next chapters, it was just THAT beautiful. If this book had stayed on track from those chapters, it would have made it to my all time favorite list.<br /><br />However, something strange happened at chapter 5 and I am still not sure why Hosseini changed direction. It was still great writing. It was still interesting. But the enchantment for me was gone. It was just good writing. The magic was left out...the interweaving of all the elements of the first part of the novel were laid off to the side. We were introduced to more stories. Yes, the narrators of these stories were all related to the main story, but not a part of it. How do I explain....I almost felt like I was reading something along the lines of 6 degrees of separation. I had no problem following along, I just was left wondering why is Hosseini including these narrators? Why are their stories included? That was it for me...they were not part of the story I feel in love with...they were their own stories. Yes, they were connected...but oh so different. They added nothing to the mystery. The added nothing to the enchantment of the first part of the novel. they were simply fillers....The ones that were important to the story were visited way too late in life to really fill in the part of their history I yearned to know of....Others were never revisited at all....Hosseini wrote a novel in the beginning that demanded I become invested in the characters and then completely ignored my need for more! Confused? I was too. Once you read the book, you will hopefully understand what I mean.....<br /><br />this book left me so thrilled with it's words and it's story...yet surprisingly empty and let down at the same time.....
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|This is a true Disney classic!  I saw this movie at Walt Disney World when I was 7 years old.  I totally forgot how much I loved this movie!
0307341550|1.0|**SPOILERS** This is the first 1 star review I have given in longer than I can remember. This book not only made me very uncomfortable, I found it utterly unbelievable. It's rare that I hate a book so much that I actually want to finish it to see if it can maintain it's utter worthlessness throughout the entire book....this one succeeded. I won't waste much time on this review, but will hit the high points of why I hated it....First of all, the mother gave me the creeps. Now I don't usually mind creepy mothers...it's just that this one made the hair on my the back of my neck stand up and I actually felt sick to my stomach and had to turn away from the book at times....then the baby sister....she made the mother look like a saint...and I had no problems figuring out who done it from a very early part. The things that bothered me the most about this book was Camille's behavior. What 30 something accepts drugs and alcohol from a 13 year old? and a sibling at that? why would she sleep with two men within hours of one another, and one that was barely a child at that? What would make a cop allow someone that was being poisoned to go back to the house that it was occurring in? Why would that cop not only allow that poisoning to reoccur, but also do so knowing he suspected not one BUT TWO people of that household to be murdering scums of society? And why would Camille allow someone to continue to poison her after she knew that it was happening? Totally ticked off that Flynn *really* expects me to buy into all of that...seriously?
B001ILFUDM|5.0|the magic of Disney!  This movie was one of my favorites when I was a kid.  It's still one of my all time favorites!
0143034901|5.0|If every book read like this for me, I would seriously find a job that I could hide behind a counter and read all day....This book nourished my soul. It was perhaps the most beautifully written book I have ever encountered. It read like pure poetry that seemed to be written especially for me. A lover's gentle caress that was so intimate that you know it was for meant for you alone. So deeply felt that it must have been written in the stars long before I even existed. This is a book that I have enjoyed so much that I am hesitant to read the second book in the series. If I were 10 years younger, or not so jaded, i would not hesitate to pick up book two....but life has taught me well...I know that oftentimes what we become enamored with often fails us in the end...perhaps is really is better to remember a perfect moment in time instead of trying to pursue it and have reality slam you in the face....yep....I know....I know....but this book ended perfectly for me....so many could be stand alone books are ruined with authors trying to \\"do the right\\" thing...I couldn't bear it if this perfection were ruined...sigh.....
0141975652|3.0|The book's title is intriguing and the author made a good effort at explaining the practical implications of how important signals are confusing with noise in application to a variety of common subjects.  So, for the person with a minimal statistics/math background, this book could be helpful.
0307389839|5.0|So weird...this of course was real life vs Murakami's imagination. I absolutely love how this man can stump me on one single sentence for minutes at a time...I just read them over and over again....this book was not like that....it was pretty straight and to the point....with most of his books I give them 4 stars right off the bat and then go back a month later and bump it up to 5 because, honestly, it sometimes takes me that long to fully appreciate him....yes, a month later, I still often think of the latest Murakami book I have read. It's true...for me, his words become part of me...they seep into my very bone marrow...but for whatever reason, this one got 5 stars right off the bat....why? I am not sure...I just know it deserves it....stupid reason, but there you have it...and really, who knew he could run 60 plus miles in a single day? Who knew he has more albums then I have books? But most of all, I felt a real connection to him after reading this book. I don't write. When I write down my thoughts they start to consume me. I loose control. It is a very scary thing for me. It's why I avoid it when I can...Murakami spends some time in this book explaining why he must run to offset the unhealthiness of his imagination...How you have to go deep inside you to be able to tap your creative vein...if you don't stay healthy on the outside, the inside will take over....me? I just have never learned how to do that...I fear one day I would just bleed out....
B00881VLCE|2.0|but now its slow, glitchy, and not smooth. force closed about 5 times before I finally got the puzzle to open. then I was dissapointed to see that the selection of pieces and dragging them across the bord was much more difficult and not as smooth as it was before. this is a shame because I really loved this app before.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|I have purchased this item and it is really good. It fits in well the kindle. It is really nice and robust looking with elegance. I would recommend adding an elastic strap on the open side to have a tight fit when it is closed.

B005GIS23I|3.0|Bashed Christian faith too much. Stereotyped people of faith as stupid and uninformed. Generally speaking it seemed to have some kind of agenda against any faith in God. Other than that I got a few laughs.

B00913DPW2|5.0|I love this game. But I do suggest you get the wake through. I've had to start this game a third time in order to collect all the items you need to finish the game. When I do finish this game, I plan to download The Haunt 2.

006178480X|4.0|I really do enjoy James Rollins' books. That might be unusual for a woman, but i always feel like i'm on a roller-coaster ride -- and i love those theme parks!  This was a wild ride, one with a number of fascinating parallel stories.I struggled a bit with the dark energy [I missed that science class when I was in college] and so i had some \\"catch-up\\" to do on my own before i understood the \\"wrinkles in time\\" etc. Not sure i understand even now, but the info in the back of the book is quite helpful. i think i might go there first, before beginning the book. I enjoyed the characters -- they evolve throughout the Sigma Force series, and that's interesting to me. Evolution of characters bonds the reader to the them and it's good writing.<br /><br />  Initially, i was a bit confused, maybe because i had a bad cold and was swilling cough syrup, but i went back and re-read from the beginning and summarized [on a small tablet] each of the critical statements that i would need to hold in my head in order to understand the book as things moved forward. That REALLY helped me.<br /><br />  As far as the ending -- I think i understand what Rollins is doing here [an alternate life that is parallel] but i keep wondering if Rachael and Vigor will try to contact Painter and Monk in the \\"other life.\\" then what would happen? I think about that a lot and try to find a way to make it a logical possibility. Maybe that's the problem. It isn't logical.<br /><br />  All-in-all, a very good read. Thank you, once again Mr. Rollins, for a number of enjoyable evenings of fast-paced suspense. We all need a dose of suspense in our lives ...fiction, of course!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|The movie is entertaining I saw it in theaters, but I noticed a lot of pixellation on my 50&#34; plasma tv.  I was connected to prime through my ps3 if that helps anyone.
B001NA6096|4.0|A really remarkable rendition of young live & the conversations that make it happen.  They managed to create a believable 90 minutes of dialog!
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|Saw this movie at the theater - 3D version, no less! I also purchased the DVD to keep at home. I am a true lover of OZ, wish this was a little bit closer or tied in to the original version. Nevertheless, the makeup and costumes were exquisite and I have already watched the movie again twice.
B005723JSQ|2.0|You somehow knew the ending in the beginning. But a fun read. If you want to relax and space out with nonsense and uncomplicated book this is it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|\\"Ender's Game\\" is poignant, science fiction story about a young five year old boy who's torn from his family and enlisted into Battle School because of his brilliant test scores. Because he's the third child in a family and was a participant in a local tragedy at school he'll not be missed by his parents or his jealous bully of an older brother; only his sister Valentine will feel the loss.<br />At Battle School Ender Wiggin, under the watchful eye of his instructors and the military excels at the simulated war games although his brilliance and resourcefulness will create envy and hatred among the other cadets. Only when he develops friendships does the strain of training and the pressure of his loneliness ease and he begins to tolerate the abuse.<br />This is a story of courage, endurance, resilience and friendship with characters that grab the reader because of their realism. Ender Wiggin's a tactical and strategic genius who is being taught to lead humanity in a war against an alien race that twice invaded earth. At times he's ruthless and cunning but sensitive to these traits which are so much a part of his brother's makeup. A bully at heart, Peter Wiggin torments his brother, jealous that he's achieving what he could not. Valentine, Ender's sister is just as intelligent as her brothers and will be manipulated by the army because of her love for Ender and by Peter in his bid for power.<br />In contrast to Bonzo and Bernard who are Ender's envious and spiteful enemies, his friends- Petra, Bean, Dink, Alai- are loyal, trustworthy and supportive. But the sad, heartrending part of the story is that the military isolate Ender from any emotional connection to family or friends which causes him untold suffering as he focuses on their goal; to save humanity from the aliens. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot, although I thought the cadets at five too young for such rigorous training but look forward to reading the rest of the Ender saga.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Light weight, compact, charges quickly and holds a great charge.  Buy two so on long trips you have one in the camera and two charged and ready when needed.  With the huge storge cards these days having plenty of power to shoot through is important.<br />Besides you never know who you might come across that would need a spare.
B0094M2S5A|5.0|OK, one of my all time favorite movies, have seen it many times and would enjoy watching right now. The music is a part of the enjoyment but the actors are just superb....every one. You don't want to miss it....it will become one of your favs too.
B00018D3RI|5.0|Oh man. I loved this show as a kid. My last name is Hutchison so I was also called Hutch growing up. Great show. Great cast. Great car. The package came quickly and as advertised. I recommend it
B007MDB71O|5.0|It is a shame the movie was marketed so poorly. It was truly a great movie. I think it was the best movie of 2012. Yes better than avenger! Not too orginal of a story but considering this book is over 100 years old and inspired many of the movies you have seen in the past makes it original enough. Great special effects and overall great cast and production
B000EAT246|4.0|I was excited to receive this movie I like so much as a kid and it didn't disappoint. Good film which came quickly and wrapped with care. I recommend it
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|I liked it. But i thought it could have ended better. The end was a bit flat and almost messed the whole book up for me. Apart from that though i liked the book. I loved it actually. I laughed out loud so many times my husband began to wonder if i was okay. lolllll. I identify totally with Ifemelu and it could easily have been me. Chimamanda is a wonderful writer and a true star of our generation. I am waiting eagerly for her next and next and next......

B007NESBK2|5.0|I've seen this particular concert in the past through youtube, but it doesn't compare watching it on Blu-ray.  Picture is so clear it's almost as if you're there watching her live.  Absolutely worth the $.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It is very helpful, easy to use and gives a detailed breakdown of all the things needed about the weather.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|Like probably a ton of people, I have some old incan/xenon Maglites around that still work perfectly, they just aren't bright or efficient by today's standards.  Obviously one of those lights is a [[ASIN:B00002N6SN Mini Maglite Xenon]] model.  For 1/2 the price of a new [[ASIN:B000HFBR1O Mini Maglite LED]], this upgrade seemed like a good way to get more usefulness from it.  And it sort of is.<br /><br />The upside:<br /><br />The flashlight is much brighter now than before, and supposedly will go 5x as long on a set of batteries (have not tested that claim).  My old xenon Mini Maglite is more useful than it was before, and I won't spend as much on batteries for it.  It also is an excellent flood light.  The beam pattern is very wide and even, with the center about as bright as the xenon bulb focused down, but with a huge brightness advantage as you go out from there.<br /><br />The downside:<br /><br />The spot to flood feature is basically ruined.  You can turn the head as before, but it makes little difference in the beam pattern.  It's more of a beam optimizer.  Twist it to get a good smooth beam with no hot spots or dim spots.  Twist it more or less than that, and you just get a crummier pattern.<br /><br />The flashlight just can't compare to the new 77 lumen Mini Maglite LED.  With this upgrade, it is about as bright (but with a wider pattern) as the new LED MiniMag on \\"low\\".  They also have similar run times.  Yet the LED MiniMag can be turned much brighter.  And it has a more focused beam and a still-useful spot to flood adjustment.<br /><br />So, at least price-wise, it seems like if you don't use the flashlight enough that battery and replacement bulb costs are a factor, just stick with the old Xenon bulb.  If you do, get the new Mini Maglite LED, and keep the old xenon one as a backup.  But, if money isn't a factor and you just want to make your old trusty flashlight better, this upgrade is great.<br /><br />Oh, the tailcap is ok.  The click is really soft/spongy feeling, but it works fine.  The one I got is O-ringed, maybe they weren't in the past.  I'm on the fence about using it.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|As a hard core sonic fan i was a little skeptical to download this... I've played handheld Sonic ports before and they always are terrible. So when I saw this i decided to stay away.<br /><br />So Sonic's 22nd anniversarry came along and this game went on sale, And seeing as I already had a cashe of amazon coins the kids bought (don't ask... -_-) I decided to download it.<br /><br />Surprisengly this game plays great and almost better than I remember it! The graphics are beautiful and smooth, the music sounds great and the gameplay is solid!<br /><br />A great game for anybody! Definitly worth the money, especially if your a sonic fan! A great way to play sonic on the go!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game. Challenging but not frustrating. My big complaint is that there are not a lot of levels. Over too soon.
B0096DZKZC|4.0|I never would have expected the level of quality i got with this game! Sonic 4 episode 2 delivers everything a sonic fan could want and then some! It's a brand new game that creates wonderful nostalgic feelings. Worth the money and the time! Every sonic fan should check this one out!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Love it every thing about the game but I get ad`s every few minutes . But I can still play for hours.
B008K8U13K|3.0|For a sonic game on the go i really can't ask for a better looking game. i t looks good, it sounds good, it's got everything a sonic fan could want..... except when it comes to the gameplay.... Sonic just moves so fast that the game borders on unplayable at times. It's really kind of disorienting, especially when he ghoes around loops and the camera rotates with him.... Too much of that can make a person nausous. Is it a bad game? no not by any means! It just takes a lot of time and paitence.<br /><br />Also not meaning to nitpick, but I want to play through the game not go through a level select screen everytime i want to go to a new zone. It's tiny things like that that kept me from giving this game a higher score.
B0053TMP24|4.0|The last book was great full of action and thrills, but this book had a few boring sequences. I definitely still recommend you read it though. The beginning and end are still luring for the reader and Mr.riordan does a great job adding bits of humor and mystery in midst of reading . Overall this book was still worth reading and I plan on reading the third book.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|After reading the first two stories from Colleen Hoover I knew I had to give Hopeless a chance. The description was so vague so to say I was shocked at some of the events was an understatement. So many twist and turns that seriously left me with my mouth hanging open.<br /><br />I loved Dean and Sky. They are both two teenagers holding on to their own secrets, one more than the other. There was one point where I felt Sky was acting her age but I couldn't blame her one bit. Dean is one of those kids that's really mature for his age.<br /><br />Overall a really good story. Loved them both from start to finish.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I really enjoyed the book even though I missed the old characters I highly recommend the book<br />I am looking forward to the fifth in the series
1451696191|5.0|This is such a great book and I would recommend it to everyone. I received the book very quickly and in great condition. I'm so glad I bought the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was my first fiction book to read in almost 20 years. I was told about it by a co-worker. Consider me now hooked on fiction. Great writing! Great story! This book has it all - action, romance, drama, etc. I am so glad I read it!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book has an interesting story line, and I felt that the characters were pretty well developed.  I don't want to ruin the story, and maybe I just didn't get it, but I felt that the explanation for why this state of affairs was decided upon was a little weak.  The book did hold my interest for the most part, but it was pretty slow moving in some places.  If you're one who wants action every chapter, you may be a little disappointed.  Overall, I would recommend the book.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|We wanted to watch RED before we see the new RED movie coming out soon. Sooo glad we did. We enjoyed it and are now looking forward even more to seeing the new one. Lots of action and some laughs too. No nudity and little if any profanity which is rare these day.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I have always loved the classic movie, and  have been interested in reading the book for a long time. There is so much more detail and characterization, which is very intriguing to me. I particularly enjoyed learning more about the origins of the Scarecrow,  Tin man,  and lion.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought it as a fathers day gift, and it exceeded all expectations. The price was cheap and the quality was amazing, It was loaded with many special features and you just can't go wrong with having all three of these excellent movies on blu ray!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|For young and old. Great film. Great message. You are never to old to be young. Or perhaps a clear illustrator of why youth is wasted on the young.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think it's a super game<br />And it's kinda like the game temple run<br />And really really really funny =)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have always enjoyed Grisham's books, but this one  is my favorite.  Like it so much it was hard to put down.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Not bad if you like simm type games. I just wish everything did not have to be tied to Facebook all the time.
B003YUQAFM|5.0|so comfortable the only problem was I should of read what was written about ordering a size larger then what I wore.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Amazingly real interaction between the &#34;stars&#34;.<br />A good story that makes you think about the Higher Power in our lives.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I have enjoyed reading and watching the adventures of Mr. Holmes over the years. This series has added to this enjoyment with it's modern version of Holmes and Watson. I plan to watch season two.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I found it gave the reader great insight into a fascinating culture.  It was an absorbing read. I look forward anxiously to his next book.
B0081336FO|5.0|I am now definitely hooked on this show. I thought season one was good, but season two had me chuckling at Holmes and crying with Watson. Bring on season three.
B0084B1T8Y|3.0|I loved the stories in The Jungle Book, but found that they were each too short to  my liking. I think that if the stories had been longer I would have been more  invested in them.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|This app gives you all the information you need and more. The forecast is accurate as well. I would definitely recommend it.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|If you're looking for a good romantic read, here it is. A typical Jane Austen novel, it is told well and just real enough. This is not one of her more memorable books, but still a very enjoyable read.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Although I have thoroughly enjoyed Rod Stewart's Song Book, etc. I missed the old Rod. &#34;Time&#34; will take you back in time because the music is Rod Stewart at his best.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book  is a wonderful ending to the trilogy! I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END!  This series is a must read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is the funniest game ever and asomest game ever.<br />it was all started because a trophy earned every<br />minon should earn something
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a lot of fun on the Kindle Fire.  It is sometimes challenging but also fun.  Makes you think and it helps to have a little patience!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love the cast and the witty writing.  Gabriel Macht has such a George Clooney quality about him and the writing is just terrific.  Definitely recommend this show!
B003EXY1WS|5.0|A great mix of songs. You have original material, covers and you can even hear of some of their songs could of ended up. The Fight and Until the end are worth the price alone if you are a A7X fan. There is are no bad songs here.
B00B7FXZQS|2.0|I've heard so many raves about this franchise, but if you're expecting a resolution to the first three films, you're going to be sorely disappointed.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I really enjoyed this more than I thought. Lots of action and a nice addition to the fairy tale of the childrens version.<br />All though nothing child like about it. Very well done. Would watch it again
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have enjoyed the Downton Abbey series immensely.  It is so well done and has kept my interest throughout each season.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So fun and funny to play to see the minion get hurt its really funny<br />As well as see the cool costumes to unlock in the shop. There are so many to choose from I can't decide.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|It's what I expected out of a mtg game. Wish it was cheaper but it's a good way to pass the time at work.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I have never experienced music like the one found on this cd. Classical music for me had always been too long and I had never attached my emotions to this genre of music. Now I realize that my emotions run deeper and experience great joys and sorrows. I recommend this cd to anyone with an open mind. You'll find yourself pleasantly surprised.
1601254679|5.0|As much as I like playing GM for games these days, it certainly is getting more complicated to take some time to plan and draft adventures before hand. Between work, study and other responsibilities, it is quite complicated to think on gaming sessions as I used to do when I was younger.<br /><br />That's where this book has provided an unbelievable source of inspiration.<br /><br />Paizo has provided hundreds of NPCs, arranging them by main class, but making use of almost all available class variants to date. This means that even when you have several pages of warriors, you really have a great array of different choices. You get NPCs of almost any level and even if you have to provide a NPC on the fly for a session, you can certainly find many different characters you can use of almost any level.<br /><br />The book is usual Pathfinder quality. Almost all NPCs have their own character drawn with very good art. Covers are paper used for the book are of great quality like all other books from Paizo.<br /><br />This is a great tool, one most GMs will certainly benefit from. And for players, it can provide plenty of ideas for different types of characters.
B00CCEHYO2|5.0|For starters I have always loved STS. This is one of my favorite bands of all time and I've loved all of their previous albums. Weightless does not fall short one bit. From start to finish, you can feel the instruments emotions in every song. I was shocked to see that Jordan Eberhardt was no longer their bassist. We was an effing phenom. But the new bassist is just as, if not better. Which is another plus. But yeah, if you like instrumental bands or just great sounding music in general, buy this album! And if you've never listened to STS, check out their song \\"The Great Plains\\" it's mind blowing and the first STS song I listened to way back in 2007 haha.
B0098XY5VK|4.0|I'm not entirely sure what George Bush has to do with this app, except maybe a not too subtle dig at our former president by the developer of the app.  My granddaughter enjoys the game though and it was free.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is an interesting game, like nothing else out there.  A couple times i got stuck and blamed it on the game, but it was me not paying attention.  Definitely download.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|This is one of my regular reads of Sparks novels. I loved the flow of the story and the surprising act at the climax.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is the best game for kindle fire. Basically you are playing Lol gone mobile! This has good graphics but can be sort of light sometimes but overall a Verry good game.
0141197706|5.0|I think the explanation of this book's difference from the others is simply that Austen became emboldened after her success with a previous work to go ahead and characterize some other types from her life's observances. These types exist, the configurations can intersect as depicted and they may have been veiled acquaintances. She also exhibits a fine sense of humor throughout her works that can be delightfully felt in exaggeration among other devices.  I listened to this episode recently, having read it previously and seen one of its video adaptations. Hearing the literal transcript is a refreshing experience for a favorite work and can reveal aspects missed by the eye.  One thing that bore home was that this book certainly contains its share of the inane and inconsequential verbal exchanges absurdly integrated in the customs and manners of the day. It's amazing what can come forth when you get two bags of air together at the same time.<br /><br />While I do encourage listening to these wonderful books, I would recommend a search for later recordings.  The ones I have come across are from the 1980's with a Flo Gibson as reader, who is American and oddly, not very adept at regular female voices.  She is good at infusing that absurd hauteur of speech so comic in these works, but her female voices are not pleasing in the main.  Recorded Books has since added some very fine British and even Scottish voices, like Davina Porter, whom I would very much enjoy hearing for this material.<br /><br />The story of Fanny Price as an underdog who finally wins acknowledgement amidst some ill use and unjustly exalted inferiors is a theme in \\"Persuasion\\" as well, and most of us thrive on it.  Like many others, Mrs. Norris excites much interest and amusement.  Somehow I could see her paired up with Uriah Heep for an even more compounded absurdity.  Like any Austen volume, this one bears regular revisits as there is so much incorporated into it.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love this game it looks so real. But it needed a few more good guns. I totally think all gun lovers should get it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Game's fat. Rely fun and kool and like rely awesome n stuff. I rely like to play it all the time
B007MDB71O|5.0|I am another of the many that did not make it to the theater to watch this movie and regret it. This movie is fantastic. I put it up with great movies like Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings and The Dark Night. Really hope a trilogy is made one day.
B009SPUSN2|4.0|its a great mix and brings back to the sterile and vital areas of GlaDOS halls. A perfect mix for any person of Portal love.
1439102732|3.0|Jodi Picoult is a brilliant writer who always tries to put you in touch with the feelings of people on both sides of complicated issues. Her tone in this book seems to show Christians as grand-standing hypocrites, though. That's why I couldn't give this a rating over three stars.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Amazing book, finished in a day. The ending, was sour. It killed me, and left a lot to still be desired. What happened to sparks?
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Does not work for me at all on the kindle fire. ..Too bad, looks like fun. I have tapped all over to no avail.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|What a great, classic/original movie! Great for a night in, rainy day, or Saturday night movie. Audrey Hephburn is amazing in it and I am so happy with my purchase!
159514188X|4.0|What was fascinating to me about this book is how our actions have profound effects on other individuals, most times without us even realizing it.  I preach this to my students all the time and this book did a nice job in putting that concept into storied form.  The words we say, the actions we do, the interactions we have are rarely inconsequential.  Does this make you think twice about what you are doing?  I know it does for me.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|This app is okay. It cost a lot of money if u want to buy separate air supplies, but otherwise I recommend this app. Especially for young kids and older kids because I'm 14. And I wish I had this app when I was younger. GET THIS APP ITS AMAZING!!!!!! :)
B00821PCJS|4.0|I'm very much enjoying this show. Good special effects, character development. I'm just suprised this didn't get cancelled for being too good.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|My son Brayden plays it a lot and loves it a lot. He begs me to play it. He loves board games.
B00846REIS|4.0|Bare was a fast read.  Seemed like a 50 Shades attempt,and was, just weaker. The story line was interesting enough to enjoy.  If you like sex(y) romance stories with an underlying plot it will hold your attention.  You do have to read the next book,because Bare leaves you hanging.  Then, you need to finish with the next one.  As I said, very fast read, storyline ( in)decent,  very descriptive.  In the end, books were a light summer read.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I love this cute, challenging game! Great graphics, and if you understand temple run, that is how easy it is.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Brings one up close and personal with the tragedy of the Tsunami. This story has a happy ending, and is based on a true story. A miracle.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I thought this one was going to be just a flat documentary book, but after I started the first few chapters, I just kept going and going. The paragraphs are flowing attractively, and the more I read, the more I found the interesting knowledges and ideas within. This is a great true story, and also inspirational one I happened to stumble upon. There are not much sports writings that left me feeling good, energized, intrigued, and eager to try the techniques myself. This one does. I felt grateful and happy for McDougall to be willing to share this good writing.
B000RO9VJK|4.0|I am new to business (an RN previously) so this book gave me a great way to approach our business in a way that makes sure we aren't slaves to our jobs but owners of a successful business.
B00C68JXAW|4.0|Not an official Bond movie, but I had to have it to complete my collection. Not part of Bond 50 collection.
B00BBQXQFI|4.0|Interesting new twist to the fairytales. my 5 year old was captivated. My wife and I enjoyed the movie as well.
B003U69IX6|5.0|We watched together and both enjoyed the film.  Good clean fun for preteen viewer.  Added popcorn and we had a nice night in.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|great game I cant wait for an update I just wish it was easier to get money not the coins the bills
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|Love, forgiveness, understanding, wisdom, and the full range of human emotions bring the characters and the dialogue to life. Regrets, triumphs, aging, and renewal are captured in this well-paced, well-written, and perfectly cast film. Brilliant actors in the evening of their lives bring to life characters in the sunset of their lives and we witness greatness on two levels of reality. You will agree with the character /manager  in the film \\"that our lives are inspired by the lives around us.\\"
0425263916|5.0|good series. I am quite disappointed, however, that Entwined in you was not the end of the story.  Is there a publishing date set for the continuation.
B009MF5BXK|3.0|It is not a bad idea to put a bunch of former stars together in an action film.  \\"Wild Bunch\\" is a perfect example of what can happen when it works.  Of course, when the current bunch made their careers out of glorifying their musculature and the violence of their action vehicles, it is not surprising that Jason Statham ends up as the best actor.  There is an impressive amount of failed facial cosmetic surgery on display, also.<br /><br />This time, the story is not bad, though the over-the-top action can be cartoonish at times.  Arnold and Bruce get more screen time, which is good, Jet Li gets less, and Chuck Norris is added -- all in all, probably a plus up.<br /><br />There are far better action flicks out there, and better takes on mercenaries, and each of these stars has far better films behind them.  The only reason to see this is to see them all together, for what that's worth.
B00CHI5F5S|1.0|Bad. Borrowed from all the great gangster movies. Characters and action unbelievable. Just plain bad. Sean Penn's character was cliche and over acted.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Now we have a third version of Superman 2, to go with the original Richard Lester version and the Donner recut.  This time out, the origin story from Superman 1 takes up a third of the movie (in S2 it was covered in a few minutes of clips from S1), and it's interesting enough.  Superman's Kryptonian and Terran fathers are top tier stars perhaps just a touch short of Brando and Ford, but that's a minor point.  Russell Crowe has an extended role to play that is going to disturb purists, but it's pretty effective.  The rest of the cast is fine, including the new Superman himself, Henry Cavill.<br /><br />The battle with Zod and his confederates is the key element of the film, and the degree to which Zack Snyder turned it into a modern action film in the mold of the Marvel films will determine how the viewer reacts to it.  Warning:  this movie is not about Superman creating and preserving his Clark Kent identity.  He is a suitably conflicted individual, searching for his role in this world, but in the end it's all about his fight with Zod.
B004MYFV0O|5.0|I've been trying to learn to draw off and on for years.  Now, with this book and the undo button on my ipad drawing program, I think I will make it!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie for the whole family! After seeing this movie, we went to see Despicable Me 2 in the local theater
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I read the book and enjoyed it overall.  My only issue was the format of the book. Basically a book of short stories about World War Z with the main character bouncing all over the globe conducting interviews.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I love Mila Kunis. Shes an amazing actress. Michelle Williams plays her role very well to. She plays a good witch really well.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|After reading a lot of disgruntled reviews of this book, I was hesitant to start it.  However, I found it very similar to the first two books and enjoyed it just the same.  Like many other readers, I had not been aware that this wasn't a trilogy until book 3 came out.  Maybe I wasn't as shocked by its lack of ending since I had heard about it by the time I started it.  Now I'm looking forward to the final(??) two books that are still in the works.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|This could have been more--but uninspired writing and shallow character development left it wanting. Didn't Renner see the mediocrity of this project?  Isn't his career going well enough he could have given it a pass?  Frankly, it is just barely a 3-star rating. I can't anticipate ever watching it a second time.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I want to believe that this is all true and am not convinced that it isn't!  We all want to pet a tiger and be able to live alongside of them in peace.  We all want to be able to endure the worse kind of circumstances and survive emotionally as well as physically.  We all want nurturing parents that will give us the tools to survive in this world.  Thank you for this story!
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|I have watched superhero firms for years.  I even own vintage copes of the Iron Man comics from decades ago.  Considering the budget and the popularity of this film I finally tried watching it--and gave up the attempt after about a half-hour.  Why?  It is incredibly shallow, the acting was stilted, the dialogue was weak, and the entire premise wore very thin.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Glad to find this for my phone, but it's still a little buggy and crashes too often.  Especially during sealed play.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Little disappointing that Eva and Gideon's story doesn't actually wrap up here, the way it was supposed to, especially since that was how it was advertised. Now we have to wait AGAIN for two more books? Uggh. Aside from that, I did think it was a decent read.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you only read one Stephen King book...make it this one.  It is his BEST.<br />It opens up so many questions and possibilities.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|this a great game to play for long rides in the car but I think that they should have one more vehicle and it should be a tractor
B003U4UNPK|4.0|This Season kicks it up a notch as John Locke & Jack Sawyer Square off and lead two separate teams through the island: one wants to get rescued and the other wants to stay????? Tune in and find out what is going on in LOST: Season Three.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is fun! The slashing of the fruit can be addictive.  I also enjoy the trivia about fruit that is at the end of game.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Even though I am a grandmother many times over, I love these movies and have watched them over and over.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|White noise....really????  This didnt do anything for me.  It was actually kind of creepy.  I would not recommend at all.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I have always loved these movies.  I bought this one for my daughter and her family. Can't wait to give it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would really recommend it. It is EPICly EPIC. I can't wait until the update comes.<br />IT is truly worth it.<br /><br />By  eagle.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Liked playing this with my 6 year old son. We had fun together and like d that it was free to use.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|What a fun game!  It is fast, entertaining and so hard to put down!!  It has become one of my favorites!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun game to play. a lot of different games to play. it passes the time really well. sometimes there are really dumb games but this is not one of them.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I'm not a zombie lover by far but I enjoyed this book. It is written in choppy, first person accounts of what happened to that specific person. The accounts do not connect together. Some stories are uplifting while others are gruesome enough to give you nightmares. Lots of swearing & difficult language (there is a glossary) or I'd recommend it to high school kids who are reluctant readers.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|The second Dire Straits album does not quite match the magic and consistency of the debut, but it comes close.  Mark Knofler's guitar work is fabulous and the mix is quite good.  The songs are varied, from the Caribbean beat of  &#34;Once Upon a Time in The West&#34; to the rockers of &#34;Lady Writer&#34; and &#34;Angel of Mercy&#34;.  In my view, the group reaches its apex with their third album, Making Movies, but each of the first three of Dire Straits albums are all good, punctuated by Knofler's guitar virtuosity.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|OMG! Uncle Rick you have done it again. What a wonderful book and it ends with a life ruined!!! (Aka) cliff hanger; can't wait for House of Hades!!!!!!!!
B009WUBERW|1.0|WAIST OF TWO HOURS OF YOUR TIME!!  WHY DID THEY EVEN BOTHER TO MAKE A SECOND ONE???<br />FUNNY HOW 5'6&#34; STALONE WAS THE SAME HEIGHT AS EVERYONE ELSE IN THE FILM!! LOL!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|In starting this book there was already a lot of anticipation and excitement since the two books before it were amazing! Gideon did not disappoint here either! He was more relaxed, more playful, and I think he's starting to reveal his inner self a little more as he and Eva begin to tackle life and its curve balls together as a couple.<br />I'm highly anticipating books 4 & 5!!!! Loved this story.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was so waiting for it and loved every minute reading it. I was so glad when I got to the end and realized it was not the end, can't wait for the next one!!!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the show and have since watched season 2 and am watching season 3 now if thought I had to purchase it.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I love the challenge of the game and the ease of play. Each level gets just a little more challenging
B00C33M2EE|5.0|We got the first Piano Guys by donating to KBYU.  We love their music.  This was an awesome deal.  Yep.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|There was something very special about this movie.  Of course, I loved Maggie Smith's performance and the moral is that one is never too old to live, love and sing.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Clint Eastwood, consciously, has created or participated in dozens of films that have defined the word \\"male\\", warts and all. This doesn't mean he ignores women or downplays their role in the world--far from it. But from the spaghetti westerns to \\"The Unforgiven\\", from the \\"Dirty Harry\\" movies to the one being reviewed here, \\"Gran Torino\\", the focus is on men and how they behave (or misbehave).<br /><br />\\"Gran Torino\\" is about a \\"last man standing\\" in a sense. Walter Kowalski (are we supposed to think of Walter Chrysler?) is the last of a generation of white men who supported his family and defined his life in the auto works of The Motor City. But the complexion of the city (pun intended) has changed over the decades. His Gran Torino, which he rebuilt, is his link to the past. How he defends it, and by \\"it\\" I mean everything he has ever stood for, is a polar opposite of the weak-willed young man next door, Thao. In fact, Walt goes out of his way to teach him \\"guy\\" stuff, whether it's guy talk at the barber or buying hand tools (not power tools--important difference) or defending himself against thugs. Walt didn't get this message across to his own son but he tries with Thao, which I thought was important. Walt's continued dispute with Catholicism only emphasizes Walt's sense of rugged, male individuality.<br /><br />Now, Thao's sister, Sue... she's another story. No fear of confrontation for her. She is as in-your-face and brutally honest as Walter. And this is what I meant earlier, when I said that Eastwood doesn't downplay the role of women. Think of Maggie in \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" or Annabeth in \\"Mystic River\\". Toughness is a universal in Clint's world, it just seems that men need to be reminded of it and how to use it correctly. In any event, \\"Gran Torino\\" is a great tour de force, a movie that came out with little fanfare, but a huge heart and lot of grit.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Performances were excellent.  Robert de Nero certainly deserved the Academy Award as best supporting actor, as did Jennifer Lawrence as best leading actress.  The movie revealed the challenges of recovering from a mental illness and I hope that the audience world learned about the circumstances regarding mental trauma.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Really loved this book. It was really a great read hard to put down. Completely different twist to the 2nd book. Wasn't really mad about the end of it.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is an excellent story of growing up from childhood to adulthood and learning that sometimes real life is not a fairy tale.  The movie was beautifully acted and filmed when a boy and a tiger had to survive in each other's company after being shipwrecked.
B003BM374K|5.0|All I can say is that I love it! Watch it now! Must watch! I mean it! Love it!  Yay!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I enjoyed it because the movie fit in as a perfectly entertaining prequel.  James Franco paid a perfect pre-Frank Morgan wizard
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I love this game but it is very difficult to move up levels. It's has become more frustrating than fun. I may delete it.
B00APYKXFS|5.0|Ignore everything else you've read about this game. The rules are simple. Don't get shot. You're the one ship flying up, everything else is flying down, and yeah, all the ships are the same color, but only yours is following the movement of your finger, which should always be moving, so if you can't figure out which is yours, maybe this game is too difficult for you. Also, you only take damage when getting shot. Hence, Do Not Get Shot, as stated earlier. You can run into anything but the red dots, those are the enemy's shots. Collect the yellow dots, which appear in large clusters, to fill a meter to activate Anti-Gravity (special power or something, dunno, I don't pay attention, too busy trying to not get shot). There's plenty of settings you can change (except difficulty, I did not see that option available). But this is NOT an easy game. It is a VERY HARD GAME. If you are easily frustrated by games that do not &#34;let you&#34; make it to the end of the first level, you won't like this. If you like a real challenge, something that doesn't give it to you watered down for a few stages, give this a try. I've been playing it for a few days (not constantly, but a few minutes here, few minutes there), and I've not yet made it to the end of the first level. I'm not even sure if this game has levels, or if it's just &#34;survive as long as you can&#34; style. Which would still be pretty cool. This one's not terrible, if you don't mind being challenged.Just a tip, do not put your finger right on top of your ship, offset it so you can see all around your ship, don't worry, it will still move with your finger.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|This game has the possibility of being a very nice game. I love the graphics and the gameplay &quot;BUT&quot; I get to around level 11-13 and it starts shutting off and it is impossible to get back on. I have even deleted the game and reloaded it because I really like it. Just don't put any real money in it until the bugs are all fixed.<br />,,
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Don't get me wrong I love the sex scenes but she could have skipped some of the sex scenes and gave us more on the story line. Way to much was left unanswered and the way it ended was terrible. I don't see why this series has 2 books left? Tell the story and not have sex every page and this series could be finished in 4 books total. She didn't even elaborate on the important beach scene.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is the best game in the world and I'm giving you a 5* rating hope you keep me updated
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|Really...........<br /><br />...........This is all you got....Come on have you heard the new JayZ..produced by Timbaland and Pharrell and thankfully not you, kanye..thankfully not you. Kanye is awesome, but not on this one..There was some hope here with the beats, but the flow and lyrics was straight garbage...You might have to trade in your Range Rover for the Corolla you bashed in after this Ye..
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show.  I can't wait to view Season 3 to see what happens to Mary and Matthew and the rest of the family.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book read them all! They were all good books and well worth the time you will not be disappointed.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book made me laugh and cry. It makes me want to be a soul that sits up when I die.  Thank-you Markus .
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I love this soundtrack. For me it is one of their best efforts. I highly recommend to others to consider.
B00BTV62KG|4.0|The original Uberjam recording was unlike any \\"Jazz\\" guitar recording I'd ever heard before. I was floored by it's originality. Uberjam Deux actually holds up better if taken on it's own terms without comparison to the original. Though there are similarities, Deux is more streamlined, though not without it's techno/sample flourishes. The grooves are diverse, i.e. R&B, Reggae, Dub, West African, even a Latin flavor on the somewhat techno \\"Torero\\", which features perhaps the best guitar solo on the CD. Despite the diverse grooves, Deux is ironically more accessible than the original Uberjam, and it's the pop/jam band feel of some of the tunes that may put off some Jazz fans who were expecting something more complex (though this isn't \\"light\\"). These are songs that will appeal to a wider audience, and once I accepted them on their own terms, I realized just how enjoyable this release is. It's a fun summer release, and well worth the listen. Personal favs: \\"Cracked Ice\\", \\"Endless Summer\\", \\"Al Green Song\\", \\"Torero\\", \\"Snake Dance\\".
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The coolest actors having fun doing what they love. The beginning the the movie dragged a bit in the true Bruce Willis film set up way but once it got started....  I really enjoyed this film.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the hunger games. I also enjoyed the 2nd book in the series very much! I was excited to start this one and get a conclusion to the story. While I don't mind the ending, seems very realistic to go with the story line, I did have a harder time following this books ending. It seemed rushed and the details didn't all make sense in how they went. While I am glad that I read the series, I do feel that this was the weakest book in the series. It felt different than the other two that came before it. Wile I think it should still be read, it was a longer read than the other two
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This one kept me going right up till the very end. I am always looking for a good story that can surprise me and this more than delivered.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|Takes me back to the concert I was blown away by last summer.<br />these gentleman have not lost anything.<br />Rush Fan forever!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have enjoyed watching my little granddaughter learn to play this fast paced, dangerous game and oh the exitement she goes through trying to make it to a destination and meet each and every catastophic challenge.  She is amazing. I could not make it to the second challenge. This game is for the young at heart with lots of stamina and quick thinking.  Great stuff.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I can't say that I am a huge Tom Cruise fan but this movie truly had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
B00D2BHO44|5.0|perfect game score music. sets you in the mood for slaying the infected hordes. perfect driving music. you can hump to it as well.
B002Z0TPFE|1.0|The acting, plot, and graphics are all horrible in this movie.  Don't waste your money or time as you will regret it.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The acting - beyond superb!  The sets, costumes, etc.... same.<br />But the momentum is just too much (for me).  Too many things happening simultaneously - with the camera spending a couple of minutes here, a couple of minutes there, and back and forth, tracking what I feel are too many intense story-lines at once.  Yes, this is the way life is... sort of... but it feels like the writers got carried away by the popularity of the series and felt they had to amp it up even more.  I enjoyed the first two series more actually... they weren't quite as 'hyper'!  (nor quite as depressing!)
B00000K3UU|5.0|Another Adam Sandler. He's just great! Makes me laugh and I bet he'll make you laugh too! Great movies to watch over and over.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|If you like Plants vs. Zombies then you will definitely like this game. It is harder, more complex, and more fun.
B00AG297GK|4.0|This movie was really funny.  Beware though, if you are offended easily, this movie is bound to offend many people.  It hits on almost if not all things you don't discuss with people in a group setting.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I like this movie. It has a sweet story with a good message. My six year old son loves this movie and the second one too.
B001XUH69Y|3.0|I had never seen this movie.  I found it enjoyable, but only worth seeing once.  I am not sure what the big draw was to this movie.  Nice twist at the end.
B00BG23LYS|3.0|...But this release is rather boring.<br /><br />I must admit though I've only listened to it only 3 times so far so my opinion may change.<br /><br />But right now I'm disappointed that this album is nowhere near as good as their first two.<br />For me the only stand-out track is Poison Apple.<br /><br />I don't regret buying though as a mediocre UNCLE album is better than most other stuff being made today.<br /><br />Newbies~buy Blood Lust first THEN this as it does sound like outtakes or B-sides...at least to me.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app daily on my Fire. It works great and puts the info I want right at my fingertips.  It was also free so that makes it especially great!
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Ordered one for my house and one for another, fondly remember this movie from my childhood. My four year old granddaughter sat and watched it all the way through, good stuff.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I really enjoy Sylvia Day's books.  She is really an interesting writer.  Do not want to put the book down until finished.
B002KKCVT6|3.0|Can't really review this product , the arch support is way too high for my foot, quality looked good. Had to wend them back
0439023513|4.0|Very enjoyable to read but not books to remember for long. I'm glad I read them but would not like for them to influence future choices.
B000J103OI|3.0|It's a good movie, it's not hilarious or something you'd like to see again but it's good to watch once.
0439023491|4.0|As an adult reading teen fiction I was surprised that the three books held my interest - in fact to the degree that reading them consumed my time. They were like a vacation - but soon to be forgotten.
142311339X|5.0|Nonstop adventure from the very beginning!!!  Fascinating way to explain greek mythology and really good story. I'm really looking foward to reading the whole series!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I play magic the card game and this is as close as you can get to playing the game without carrying all those cards. Challenging and lots of fun.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I have to buy the series because I'm one season behind but it's definitely worth it! I love this series so much!!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed the first and think its a well written pacy book with good characters. screw your four more words Amazon
0525478817|5.0|Beautiful story, it had me thinking about it for weeks after I read it! I laughed and cried and laughed some more and I loved it!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This got a bit dark for me at times, I know that's ironic given the theme of the novels but still...
B000LC55F2|5.0|It was unpredicrable and thrilling. You'll definitely want to watch it again!<br />I loved it!!!! Became one of my favorite movies!
B001QOGYFO|2.0|This movie lost my interest the moment the US Marshall lost her fingers due to frost bite.<br />I kid you not.<br />This after she accessed a computer terminal, called up files etc.  How do one do that if you cant move your fingers...better question might be -- how do you not notice it?<br />The story premise is sound and the acting is not horrible.  But even in fiction logic should remain.<br />WaAr
1451696191|5.0|One of the best books i've read and one of my favorites! Both the book and the movie leave you with the same feeling at the end.. it really is beautiful and worth it. You'll want to re-read it over and over again!
B00A8M7H42|5.0|I was a little skeptical about getting this figure at first, but now I'm glad I added him to the collection.  He looks fantastic great detail, his box is slightly bigger then the rest of the figures. Batman fans will love it
0061726834|5.0|At first I thought I wasn't going to be really but as I started reading i couldn't stop and it was all I though about, ypu know what they say! Don't judge a book by its cover! I definetly recommend this book for those people who like romance and dystopian societies
1455526959|4.0|Michael Connelly had gone from a favorite author to a huge disappointment. His last few Harry Bosch books seemed worse then phoned in--it seemed like author couldn't care less about his character with implausible story lines and rushed endings (Nine Dragons, eg.). The Black Box isnt great but a vast improvement.<br /><br />The story about a cold case from the LA riots is well plotted with plausible twists.  There is some puffery about jazz. And harry's relationship with his teenage daughter is an angle I  could have lived without but I suppose it is the author's attempt to humanize a sometimes unlikable cop. The ending isn't Connelly's best, but I always thought he rushed them.<br /><br />It is just such a relief to see the author back with something resembling his stride that i was happy to overlook the drawbacks I mentioned above.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I love the vampire diaries I started reading the books but I think only the first three are the originals so I staryed watching the series and so much better than the books! And I've never said that about a series/movies based on a book i've read
B002C949AE|4.0|Really interesting and informative story about young girls' and women's life in Somalia. The story tells also about difficulties Waris Dirie had and won here in western world. All the story is written well.
B0019HQIGS|4.0|I really liked the concert, John Mayer is one of my favorite singers but it's a bit different.. it's not the type of concert that has fireworks or back-up dancers and that kind of stuff. It's more about the music not the show. I really enjoyed it.
B008NF45S2|3.0|Purchased for the convenience and option to print, after Moto dropped their in-house printer app.  App seems really slow, is issue with app or really the printer? I dunno.  Makes it a real pain when I suddenly want to print from device, usually worth time to load up a real computer and just print from there after the wait and headache of it all.
0142418471|5.0|I laughed so much while reading this! I've read it twice and I still laugh and love it! The part I loved most was david levithan's half.
B0006J28MI|5.0|Great movie doesn't matter how much money you got if you have no friends or family it means nothing this kid was loaded but never had a chance to be a kid a movie for all ages a feel good movie
1423140591|5.0|Between Percy Jackson and the Olympians and Heroes of Olympus I think Heroes of Olympues is more for teenagers because the characters are more grown-up now and there's more romance and drama.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't wait for the new rooms....awesome!  I have the whole family addicted.  Just enough of a challenge to keep it entertaining.
1423140605|5.0|Your mind will be blown at the ending! It is recommended for all ages! And people that love fantasy and adventure!
B00BTHV05M|4.0|Sounds like One Republic.  The singer's voice has a few trademark aspects that make this a band I always enjoy listening too.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love this game.  Mystery games are my favorite type of games to play.  This game has good puzzles, nice graphics, and is a nice blend of hidden object and puzzles.  The story is good, also.  I hope the next installment is just as good.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|I have been a big fan of XX since their first CD came out a couple of years ago.  I have shared my likes for their sound with as many friends as I could and I highly recommend it.
B0031FNYGS|5.0|This Pegasus toy is so beautiful and life like.Its about 6 inches long and 4 inches tall with beautiful sparkly wings and a golden sun symbol on its rear end and on its neck.There's also glitter on the mane and tail and on the hoof fur.I got this Pegasus not  for a child but because I collect horse and schleich  animals.
B00000253N|5.0|Very good deal on this oldie but goody.  Saw him live in Philly last Fall.  Glad to have the memories.
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|YOSSI'' YOSSI'' JUST SEXY! LOVE THAT DADDYO'' AND THE STORY LINE TOO'' JUST SEXY! WE NEED MORE STORY LINES LIKE THIS..
B00A4VGUIG|3.0|It takes a while to figure it out.The first thing you do is give Eddie the bucket.<br /> He does not take it,but a fish sign shows up. My granddaughter gave up at first,<br />  she likes it now.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|It was supposed to be a trilogy, but the number three is just awfull. She lost the story line in order. To sell 2 more books.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Great album, all songs are enjoyable and best price on Amazon! I like that I can buy cheaper on Amazon and still use on my iTunes for my iPhone and iPad.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great puzzles in this game. Wonderful graphics for a unique experience. It keeps you guessing. I would recommend this game.
B00581BQG8|2.0|A couple of really funny moments, but not worth 2 hours of my life. At least now I know not to let my kids watch it when they're teenagers.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Tougher than the other angry bird games to beat the levels to get those third stars.  I've spent hours on the same game and could' t get that third star.
B0097C8XL0|4.0|Sadly yes, me and my husband play this game. It's very entertaining, I think it's good for all ages.....obviously ^_^ and its free, yes you can buy or like things to get more out of the game like characters but it's<br /> not that important really maybe only to kids. Any who it is a great game for fun or passing time.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Good show...not very original, but very entertaining and funny.  Definitely better than all those boring reality shows.  I looks Suits and will watch all available episodes
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mojang has really outdid themselves with Minecraft Pocket Edition. This is by far the best app you will ever purchase for you mobile device.

B00992CF6W|5.0|ALOT of people don't think girls play this, we do, I love this,  but I think the creeper should blow up more often, I've had it since May(it's July) and I've only seen 1 creeper blow up
B001EC0OMM|5.0|All star cast and acting! Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart amd of course the late great Katherine Hepburn. They don't make them like this anymore that's for sure. If you long for the great actors and timeless classic you must get this for your collection.
0596007124|5.0|I had read some other books before about design patterns. Although they were good books, I found the reading a bit dry and they mostly gave the design pattern solutions as-is without too much explanation of the disadvantages of the alternative ways of solving the original problem the pattern was meant to solve.<br />&#34;Head First Design Patterns&#34; book goes deeply and thoroughly into the motivation of each design pattern so it's more easy to understand all of their aspects and the drawbacks of other alternatives.<br />The thorough explanations makes it more easy to remember and understand the patterns.<br />The book is friendly to read and I definitly recommend it to anyone who wishes to understand design patterns.
B0014DW3OS|5.0|Ok , I'm not for violent movies but this was good! Exciting , suspenseful and no pauses! Great acting Ethan Hawk delivers in this film, as well as a host of others to make this movie a gotta have in your collection.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It feels like I have a real horse it should have more things to do on it it will make it more interesting
B008GJV4F2|5.0|Love Jonny Depp too in this wonderfully scripted and acted movie of a quaint little village filled of crazy people, we all lived in one, so it's easy to connect to the people and stories. Judy Dench is awesome in this!
B008469DGY|4.0|a quick swing with a little guidance on the flight of the ball and you can improve your technique, Golf
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Jessica Tandy, Kathy Bates, Mary Louise Parker and Masterson are amazing togther in this southern epic film about friendship and perseverance. The music is also a plus .
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved it! Fantastic acting..psych- social conditions of humans at their worst...Really demonstrates the good and bad of human condition...I will watch again..the casting of this series couldn't been better
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Sometimes I just want fun feel good music that is new to my memories and I don't have to go down memory lane.
0300169787|5.0|I bought this as a present, and the recipient was delighted. This is a gorgeously produced, spectacular oversized catalogue. Though I am not really a fan of Alexander McQueen, I enjoyed looking at this before I sent it!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I just like the way it makes me feel... new and old at the same time and it's not someone just yelling at me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not a huge Sci-Fi reader, but this post-apocalyptic novel is well written and the story will grab you in the first few pages.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Very challenging. I'm Color blind so that part of the game is difficult. Have to get my daughter to help. But cant wait for next set of rooms.
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|Worked on my previous phone, but DOES NOT work on HTC DNA. Will take the picture, trim it, then.... Nothing. Was a really good product.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|have followed Grisham since I picked up A Time To Kill years ago.  Overall, I felt this was an easy read that held my interest and considering that he made it all up out of whole cloth.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Not at all my type of show but I love it.  Fun to see the old technology.  Great characters, great plot.
B004GYY714|4.0|An esas to use application, friendly, you can find all the music that you usually listen too including those old melodies.
B001XUT6AG|5.0|What's really fun about this movie is that it skates on thin ice the characters.  Spock is quoting a Vulcan proverb:  &#34;Only Nixon Could Have Gone to China&#34; and Kirk gets to kiss himself thanks to a manipulative shape shifter on a prison moon.  Meanwhile, everyone is lying through their teeth Star Fleet which is having it's own conundrums.  They don't call it that.  They say &#34;error&#34;, or &#34;choice&#34; but they're still doing it.  But all for a good cause because in the end, it's all about turning the Klingons into partners for peace and by golly, it works.  In any case, it's just fun to watch.  Love it.
B009WGSB9U|5.0|this CD is from the movie of the same name and was supurb which was probably the best foreign film of tgus tear
B00499QUK2|5.0|The BBC has, as of late, been doing a marvelous job of bringing some very excellent entertainment to the telly. And the Sherlock series with Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman is a sterling example. It's smart, CURRENT, savvy and witty batch of stories that set an iconic character in our modern world in the most believable way you can imagine. Highly recommend this!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Update as of August 3. I almost finished the 30 day shred, 4 days left. Although I haven't moved up to level 3 yet, I gotta admit: Jillian is simply THE BEST! I can't stop looking at the mirror and checking myself out. I got definition everywhere, my whole body is slimmer, more toned. All my old clothes that I almost threw out now fit perfectly. Men started to pay compliments to me and the way I look. I have more confidence in myself. I am an actress (theatre) and it's very important for me to look great, especially with all those young and skinny girls coming in. Also I am more athletic now, I can jump and run, and I always hated it.<br />Yes, I ate extremely healthy: mainly organic, whole foods, lots of veggies, no sugar or flower. But I didn't even give up my wine!<br />I am 41 years old, and I was size 12 for a couple of years, and it was driving me crazy. Now I am back to size 10 and keep shrinking! I look 30 and I feel 30, thanks to Jillian.<br />To sum it up: If anyone tells you that you can't tone up and lose weight because of age, metabolism, body constitution, genetics or any other stupid excuse - don't listen. Eat right, do Jillian's exercises, and try to get rid of stress as much as possible - and you will be healthy, slim, energetic, happy and beautiful. Guaranteed! (I am sexy and I know it :) :)keep you posted on the results.<br />BTW, I am 41, 25 pounds extra weight, in and out of exercising throughout my life.<br /><br />***** UPDATE<br />I am on day 15th of the 30 day shred, and I am SO HAPPY!!! Some of the reviewers here are super-fit, and they need to add something more to this routine. I don't! I just use heavier dumbbells, exercise without modifications and stretch way more at the end than Jillian does. And I can see results: I lost weight, I am much more fit, my endurance is much better, I am not sore anymore (couldn't sit down without grinding my teeth until day 10), I actually enjoy the exercise and look forward doing it every day. My clothes fit better. And even my friends noticed the difference.<br />Mind you I am also eating healthy. Nothing with flower or sugar, nothing processed. Your basic Mediterranean diet. Delicious and slimming. Oh, and no eating after 7pm.<br />Overall I am feeling much better, more confident in the way I look. Of course there is much more to go, but I know now that I am on a right track and I will reach my goals. And I won't stop after I reach them, this is a life time change.<br />One very important thing: good form is everything here. It's very intense and fast paced, so it's easy to forget to hold the right form. Always, always make sure you follow Jillian's advice on how to do this right. It's totally worth it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Good keeps track, of your battery how it discharges and what uses it the most and when to charge it.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|good movie for me, it a real story, it is really good actor and really need to see this movie.
B00932A4XE|1.0|Well, it had some star power but the film is so boring that I dropped out of it after 45 minutes
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|This was my first Courtney Milan book and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I was pleased with the quality of the book. It is a romance novel but has a good story line. Wish she would have gone a little more in-depth with the characters but overall I liked the book and will continue in the series.
B002B2ZIES|4.0|Initially only purchased on song.  Back on Black.  Liked it so well that I purchased the whole CD.  A little too easy purchasing off net.  Could get out of hand if not careful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am always bored and tired and needs a break so I lay on my bed and play with my horse if you buy this game you won't regret it
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Great album (how's that for dating me).  Brings back great memories.  Would recommend to anyone, even if your are not a James Taylor fan.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a awesome easy mobile app for kindle fire but the only problem is that it doesn't say your online.... bummer.. but the app is fabulous it's self I love the emojios there's tons!! And the news feed is fine!! Works great love it and its free so Try it out!(:
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|My entire family love the movie.  great story.  A must movie to have to watch over and over..  It's great for when you need a little something to make you laugh.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Everything about this album and era is perfect. Britney was heavily involved in the creative process, even writing and producing. She really made sure that this album was very adult-sounding, infectious, and artistic. EVERYONE knows and loves \\"Toxic\\" of course, and most know the perfect ballad \\"Everytime\\". There are so many good things I could say about every song on this album. \\"Touch of My Hand\\" is my personal favorite by a long shot, but I also love \\"Showdown\\", \\"Outrageous\\", and \\"Shadow\\". The only songs I didn't care for on this album are \\"Me Against the Music\\" (bad first single choice) and \\"The Hook Up\\" (pure filler). Overall this album is cohesive & beautiful.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I have read several of Neil Gaiman's books and this new novella is by far my favorite. He has captured childhood's essence, at least from my 42-year-old recollections, and laid it out in one of the most completing stories I have read in years. The details of the story are beside the point. This is a child's fairy tale meant for adults and my life richer for having read it.
B00CM6ZLG8|2.0|Okay, I'm torn between calling this or Don't Forget her worst album. They're both mostly boring filler. I think the artwork/photoshoot for this album is hideous. The music is even worse. \\"Made in the USA\\" and \\"Without the Love\\" are Demi's two worst songs. \\"In Case\\" and \\"Nightingale\\" are extremely boring ballads with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. \\"Heart Attack\\" is good I guess, but nothing special. \\"Never Been Hurt\\" sounds like a Kelly Clarkson reject and \\"Neon Lights\\" is a screechy, pitchy attempt at trying to stay current within the Top 40 scene. I like \\"Shouldn't Come Back\\", \\"Warrior\\", and \\"Two Pieces\\"; they let us know that Demi has the ability to make a great, interesting ballad/midtempo. My favorites on this album are \\"Really Don't Care\\" and \\"Something That We're Not\\". Now that she's got her 'deep', watered-down ballad album out of the way, here's to hoping she returns to the pop rock sound that she's famous for.
B002MFULQO|5.0|Oliver Stone and the cast retell the story in such a way that you become immersed in the picture.  Costner, Bacon, Jones and Pesci make you believe you were there.
B00DTMCSO2|3.0|This game is really fun!! I think that you will really like it!! Especially since it is the same creator as virtual families 2
B004HY9NKI|4.0|A perfect re-creation of a 70's grindhouse exploitation flick right down to the scratches on the print. In fact, I'm surprised my shoes didn't stick to the floor after watching this movie. It is loaded with gratuitous violence, gratuitous sex, and gratuitous Danny Trejo, so what's more awesome than that?
0575089911|4.0|The cover looks really damaged, it shouldn't been rated as &#34;good&#34;; other than that, it's a great book! (don't judge it by its cover, right? :) )
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Offered right amount of difficulty but not<br />so much to make one quit~ did keep me up past bedtime ~ want more...
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|When I read this book I was staying up all night trying to take in all of the amazing adventures and comedies that it provided.
B00BTHV05M|4.0|Great music by a great band.  Can't go wrong with this CD if your a One Republic fan. I highly recommend.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It was such a great app until they decided to put the upgrade on. I don't even really know how to use the new upgrade. They need to put it back. When they do I will put it right back on my kindle. Please put it back! !!
B005LAII80|5.0|I almost never buy movies but after not watching it in theaters and getting though other means...I wanted to support it. While I'm assuming most of the negative reviews come from older people who dont understand that this is an adult movie this movie is actually really good. If you want a good action flick that doesnt try to appeal to kids then this is it, story is minimal but action and everything else is excellent!<br /><br />BUY THE MOVIE IF YOU WANT A SEQUEL!!!!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I was prepared to dislike this film.  Lee Child's Jack Reacher is 6'5&#34; tall and weighs 250 pounds.  Tom Cruise is, er, not quite that big.  Further, I dislike Cruise' personal life.  Two strikes right off the bat.<br /><br />That said, I was able to suspend my prejudice and really enjoy the film.  It's beautifully done, and while I can't recall how faithful it is to the novel, it is quite a ride.  Try it, you'll like it.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Bought this for my son and he fell in love with the movie as I did when I first say it with my kid brother and niece at the theatres.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|You get so caught up in the story.  It is interesting to see how people lived early in the 20th century.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is one of the very few games in this genre that I really enjoy.  The jibberish speak of the pudding monsters is hilarious. Truly enjoyable.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Great fun, enjoyed watching this program. The story lines are believable, acting is good. It is a good program for adults.
B00BVYU2P2|1.0|This was the dumbest, and most disgusting show. Wouldn't waste my time watching it. I couldn't even watch more than 10 minutes of it.
B000UDNBQW|5.0|Mister Pip is a book that will imprint upon your heart and leaved you change forever. I am still trying to dry my tears because of the courage and wisdom shared in the pages of this book. This book will hold a place in me forever more. I am a person entranced by literature. .
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Compared to the other books in the Crossfire series this one was by far the worst! There are so many things that are brought up in the book that don't make any sense and you don't really care which I guess will make more sense in the next book but to have an entire book filled with that is BORING. Also, such a big event happens in this book and I feel like hardly any time was spent on that. This one was a major flop!
B0050DIWFC|1.0|This captured me from mid point on that I was compelled to finish it.  But I found myself disapointed in the ending .  In my opinion it was too much especially when mom was so unattached for such a long time...then goes overboard without old questions....then the final act.  Ehh
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|this movies is just wayyyyyyyyy too drawn out, took me two days to watch it, could have been a lot better though it did have its funny moments
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I was impressed with the abundance of research and constructive advice on steps we can take as a society and as individuals towards a more equal and respectful world.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|Great movie...a classic and in HD it is even better! Definately worth the money cause the movie never gets old.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My wife and I love puzzles and this is a lot of fun. We are looking forward to more levels.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I just got back from a trip and I used it everyday.<br />The clock worked great and I was never late for an appointment.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|I saw this film at a drive-in in the 70s, back when you could have a picnic on the hood of your car while watching the movie. This is a great movie, and I love to watch it again every so often. This edition has the deleted scenes. It's a must have classic for horror & Sci-fi monster fans.
145210655X|4.0|This was bought my for son (2) and my husband, the big star wars fan. My husband likes the book a lot but our son isn't quite there yet. It's cute pictures about father/son interactions but what dissapointed me is that there isn't a story line. Just lots of different pictures with minimal words that aren't related.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|What more can be said about Star Trek?  I certainly can't hope to add anything useful or new to say about it.  I love Star Trek in spite of its flaws, or maybe because of them.  Revisiting the show via the digital streaming to my Kindle simply renews my enjoyment of the series.  This is the root of the franchise, what started it all.  Whether or not a person appreciates it, Star Trek is a major cultural phenomenon.  I for one am glad it keeps finding new ways to present itself even while I enjoy the original.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|too many french words that were not translated so the meaning of what was said changed. it would have been better if the author had translated some of the french. i did love the twist in the story but I wasn't so sure about the ending.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Playstation controllers have the smoothest quality control.<br />As a Black Ops fan, I notice a very big difference in smoothness compared to other brands of controllers.<br /><br />Smoothness: (1) PS3, (2) 360, (3) aftermarket = blockiest.<br />The Sixaxis control has a shorter burn-in period, but continues to maintain smooth control (in my experience).<br />Dualshock 3 maintains it's perfect amount of stiffness--especially good for FPS gamers.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Universal in nature (no proprietary restrictions)<br />- Smooth<br />- Classic look<br />- It is much improved over the analog version, the PS2's Dualshock 2. Analog is essentially 4-direction arcade stick if used on a PC.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Sure, the controller could be less compacted together joystick arrangement, but precision holds more value.
B005HEQ4XQ|4.0|This season was very good. Really enjoy the cast especially data. Patrick Stewart and Jonathan frakes make a great duo.
B005UD1D62|4.0|I can't help myself.  I'm a 30-something still reliving my Laguna Beach days.  Love Lauren and her books!<br /><br />Read on my Kindle.  It's nice to see e-books without grammatical errors.
1449433251|5.0|I have wanted to buy the hard cover but just couldn't justify the cost. Then the soft cover came out, and I, being an incredible cheapskate, bought that instead. Another advantage to the soft cover edition is that it's split into four volumes, so if the whole family wants to read it you don't have to argue about it.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I don't know why...  The app didn't seem very user-friendly.  I have it on my Kindle but rarely use it.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|the movie was better in 3d then 2d. I say all 3d movies are ok to excellent never bad. I love 3d.it is fun to put on the 3d glasses and watch it.it is fun. if you like 3d like I do buy this movie in 3d and watch the 3d form.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great app!  want to keep playing! can not wait to see more of these puzzles! just need to be persistent and think. out of the box!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really really good game it is very fun and stuff it is like a mix of subway surfers and temple run
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 does not disappoint-- the characters are wonderful and the story keeps you wanting more and more. It's a shame the US has to wait so long to get Downton over here. I would recommend this show to anyone!
B001GA1RFA|2.0|My first read of Green was  &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34;, a truly great book that portrayed two wonderful tragic lovers and a book that is among my very favorites.  I then read &#34;An Abundance of Katherines&#34;.  I just could not find sympathy with the main character and the plot wandered about as the author was seemingly lost.  The end of the book drifted off to a nowhere end. Be sure to read &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; and skip this book.
B003XE1CU2|5.0|These shoes, in all colors and most styles are very comfortable and my favorites. To me, it feels like you are walking on air.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|there has not been a single episode in all 4 seasons that I didn't like!  great writers!  great actors!  great show!  a welcome change from all the reality/trash TV these days.  keep up the good work :).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is a very good cast, the acting is wonderful, it is very will done.  5*****stars Looking forward to Season 4....
B00005O3VC|5.0|Pythons have been part of my life for a long time and this movie is in my top five of all the movies I have ever seen and I love movies.
B00A757EFW|2.0|This game is for children, when I purchased it I remember loving it in my youth, so there is a age limit I feel anyways.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great little brain teasers each level. Must pay attention to details. What happened to just saying it is fun....won't be giving feedback if they tell me how much I must say
B0092S4WLY|2.0|This is extremely hard and you get to frusrated I am on the 2nd floor and opened the door but did not  go up to the next floor, maybe it is just for the youth????????
B00987MQRQ|4.0|Great read for someone looking for something a little dark and different. A little short for my tastes but nevertheless a good read.
0307743659|5.0|I Loved this book, it was so much more than I expected. I feel that it was way better then the movie
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|The graphics are excellent and the weapons are of the period except for the bureau weapons. The games itself is great with some of the scenes repeating themselves with enemies in different places.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|One of the best things on television let alone prime time. Superb art direction and engaging story arc. Love Mads Mikkelsen!
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I did not expect the turn of events in this movie. Which made it even better than I thought!<br />The random cruelty of the characters plus the revenge aspect made the plot quite interesting.
0141439475|4.0|Great novel, ordered this for one of my classes. I purchased a used one with torn edges and notes written in them, but they were useful!
B00C5XBAOA|1.0|Purchased this family set along with the castle and carriage sets (reviewed separately).  The King and Queen do not speak at all, and the others in the set all speak in Sofia's voice.  The characters cannot sit properly and the heads are constantly coming off.  I thought perhaps we got a \\"bum\\" set but reading the reviews it appears that no one is able to get them to work properly and they're just poorly made.<br /><br />My daughter has a big imagination and begged me to let her keep this bundle of junk instead of returning everything for $100 worth of quality, so it sits here in our house to remind me:  NEVER buy on preorder!  Wait, read reviews, and do your homework.  Disney/Mattel don't care about quality anymore.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|only thing missing I think, is the text to speech. Un fortunately, I have the habit of trying to swipe and push the screen on the Kindle. I still prefer the Kindle, but the Samsung Galaxy will do when I forget to bring the Kindle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game was really fun, some challenge to each level. finished this game in one afternoon.  would love to have more soon and would download again!
B00AB7IA1S|5.0|Granted I'm only on level 1, but this app is fun. It's pretty easy to figure out and has a great tutorial. I like that you can zoom in and out and rotate. I'm using the Kindle Fire HD and I'm having no problems with the game rotating. Also the music is nice.
B00C1CO0XS|4.0|Enjoyed the revival of Nat King Cole classics.  George Benson certainly has the smooth voice required to deliver &#34;Nature Boy,&#34; &#34;Mona Lisa&#34; and the other ballads.  The only miss is the opening version of &#34;Mona Lisa&#34; which is preformed by Benson when he was child.  Otherwise, this is fireplace music.
0061980269|4.0|Yes, there is such a thing as summer homework when it comes to Honors Courses.  To give her eyes a break i purchased this copy.  Nice size, but not too big.  What else can i say about a classic?
0802473156|5.0|This product was referred to me by someone who wrote a book and is an author. she asked me to get this book for almost a year until I finally gave in. It was just as promised. Helped me understand my own &#34;love language&#34; along with my husbands.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Entertaining and challenging. Not too difficult. Made it through all 10 levels in just over an hour. Cannot wait for more levels.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I've loved watching this show since the first program. Very pleased all four seasons are part of my Prime Membership. This is one of those programs that you can't guess the end. Extremely family friendly without worry of language or nudity.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was an insightful look into the life of a young woman shuffled through the foster system and the woman who loves her unconditionally.  I felt like I was a part of their lives...always a good sign for a good read!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Book was interesting and held my attention throughout the book. Colleen Hoover is a great writer and i appreciate her work. Looking forward to more of her work.
B00CM9JKQM|2.0|I have been a Queensryche fan since the 206 Records vinyl EP.  I have been a strong advocate of the band since Todd La Torre's recruitment and I am thrilled to see the band embracing their founding roots while moving to the future.  They truly deserve the credit they are receiving for moving forward and the newfound hope in the live shows.  Queensryche has nailed and surpassed everything that is or was Queensryche with this album in the perspective of it having been 19 years since they were themselves. Todd is amazing with old and new original material. The band seems happy and well on their way to (re) building their brand. I truly consider myself fortunate and lucky that my favorite band has returned to their glory. They nailed the songwriting, the arrangements, the recording, the packaging...all ruined unfortunately by Mickey Mouse Mastering somewhere along the way. The disc pops, cracks, distorts, and is so heavily compressed all the space and emotion is completely sucked out of otherwise brilliant music. I have played it now on 3 separate systems - reasonable computer rig, reasonable truck rig, and a reasonable home system as my further revealing mid grade audiophile-ish rig is upgraded. Given Geoff's F.U . wildly publicized and apologetic mastering faux pas one would think someone in the band would listen to a prepress printing for approval. As it stands it is unlistenable in its present form. Perhaps the vinyl is better? Everything about this album is perfect except what matters most - presentation of the music to the listener.  While I will always wish the band well, I also wish that they not continue to produce sonic disasters for their catalog.  If the final product is going to sound like this, why bother?
B008CPZNL6|5.0|You get not only news but other stuff (technology, photography, food, etc) in one apps.  You can get news which you will not find in a major newspaper.  Just try it and you will really, really love it.
B00634GHJA|1.0|I'm not sure if it is the app/program or the kindle, but I can't get the transfer to work.  It is most frustrating!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|what I was looking for in an app. it gives me the weather and it is very helpful for planning my day.
B0053XM7ZU|5.0|as with the first books in this series. Full of suspense and just when you think you know what's coming, something totally different happens. Many of my favourite characters are suddenly gone!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A fun game that is fun to plat yet makes you think at the same time.  It is not too difficult that one cannot figure out the levels but you still can enjoy the challenge.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|from first page to the last. Lots of attention to details and you never know what's going to happen. Excellent read.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Life is beautiful.  Life is tough and does not always have the out come we desire.  Wether reading about it or living it.  I grieved and I rejoiced for the choices  they were each allowed to make for them selves.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I thought this book was exceptional!  I loved the heroes bad boy persona and the valid history behind it. It was well-plotted and well-written. I'm looking forward to reading the next brother's story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so much it's really fun to play when you are bored my little sister enjoys playing my &ldquo;Kendle&quot; as she says and loves to play with the horses in this game
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I must say , first and foremost , I feel this a true representation of the band . I say that because some reviews I read before I purchased were complaining about Henley and Frey were the star attractions . They do appear in this a lot more then the others but consider there contributions . You got Lennon / McCartney Jagger/ Richards Simon / garfunkel you get the point . Henley / Frey are another song writing duo who deserve to tell there story . Second , yes the live show is kinda short and Henley will prolly release the full show for an absorbed amount and ...... I'm buying it . If your a fan you have hell freezes over and other shows on DVD anyway this is just a glimpse in the past of there shows . Buy it you'll like and feel satisfied that they didn't sugar coat anything ......really !!! N
B008MM9630|5.0|This a very cute game wish there was easier quests without diamonds or if it was easier to get diamonds that would be cool
B0000256HE|5.0|It's PF at its best, Delicate Sound of Thunder is one of the best pieces in music and one of my favourites.<br />Love PF, bought this to replace my former album which was stolen.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I really like this game but when I get to the world with sand I die lime rite away there Is something wrong with it so I no longer try the makers of this game should really fix the problems if they want people to keep playing the game other then that I love the game
B007J4T2G8|2.0|James uses the same words over and over to describe her characters that I could predict it. Very redundant and disappointed in this book.
B007EC27QM|4.0|I use this app at work. I like the large face which makes ur easy for me to use. I like the design...very elegant. I also like that you see your history as you do subtotals.
B006GH6IWU|4.0|I had seen bits and pieces of this on TV and wanted to be able to view the whole video.<br /><br />I enjoyed it very much as I like the history of Queen and the diverse personalities of the band members.  Each member contributes to their story with not only talent but intelligence.<br /><br />The ending was difficult to watch but needed.  It's a very good reminder that we all have struggles and must carry on as best we can.  We never know where or how our lives will end.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I was so excited when I saw this game for the kindle cause I played it all the time on the computer. I even have 3 FB acct. So I can play more...<br />I was however saddened when I ran out of hearts and logged into another acct and it wouldn't give me hearts for the other accts like it does on a regular computer. Very disappointing I can only play out my turn on one acct.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Couldn't put the book down once I got into the story.  Great ending.  Sad but good. Can't wait to watch the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this movie so of course I  had to read the the book which  is even better!! I would read it again and again. I deft recommend reading especially if you've seen th  movie is funny to see how th  books differ from and go along with th  movie.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|What an awesome NDE.  His experiences are such a comfort to a Mother that's still here and her son has been in Heaven since 3-21-1988.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great app for horse lovers you can have a horse or have multiple horses but when pop-up ads come up on my kindle fire it takes a little time to get back to the game&middot;
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Couldn't put this down. Was completely immersed in another<br />world, the world of there-not-there, and hated to leave. Magic does exist and Neil Gaiman knows it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A great game with plenty of turns to keep you liking it. Great graphics. I would recommend this to anyone, all ages included.
B005ES0ZKS|5.0|only con( problem) with it is that there are limited color options.<br />very happy with it , will recomend it to friends.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is cool my little sister plays it all the time and me too :D and i love it so muchhh
B0025UHKNS|1.0|Just received my Garmin Forerunner 405CX.  Thought I would write an initial review and then update as I progress over the next few weeks.  So I bought this and a new Schwin AC Performance Plus bike in an effort to get in shape.  Reality is, after a long hard day, yes I come home and like to watch an hour or two of TiVo.  Bad thing is, TiVo is in the bedroom.  I suppose I could move it to the living room, but then I lose on-demand, sucky Comcast cable.  Did I digress.  So I am 5'8, 215 pounds, don't consider myself obese, but according to BMI charts, I am.  I am average, no gut, but apparently, I am overweight.  So I admit it.  Anyway, my partner is really getting tired of me coming home late from work and watching TiVo, so in an effort to make some positive changes in my life, I bought the spin bike, mounted a flat panel TV and now I spin while I watch TiVo.<br /><br />So I am really getting into this.  Feeling good about myself.  Loving the energy.  Starting to see the pounds drop, sadly not the inches, but it is coming.<br /><br />So I got this watch because of it's ability to sync with my MPower console on my bike.<br /><br />Let me tell you, first off, set-up of this, especially on a Mac, was brutal.  Leave yourself 2-3 hours to first, figure out how to replace the ugly plastic band with the sexy velcro bands they send you.  First tip, there are two velcro bands, but you only use one of them once you figure out how to remove the original plastic wrist band.  There are actually two lengths of velcro, but frankly the in my opinion, the velcro is sexy.  So follow the directions to get the straps replaced, hopefully you don't break or lose the pins.<br /><br />Once you get that done, then your on to setting up your profile and your software.  If you are a Mac user, there are two pieces of software you need, 1) The Garmin Ant Agent, and the Ant plugin for Mac.  When you initially login to garmin.com it prompts you to set up the plugin.  But then couldn't find my watch.  Tried multiple times over an hour and a half.  Finally realized that there was additional software to download for my mac, the ANT agent.  Once I did that I tried to connect and it asked for my Garmin Connect login.  Multiple times trying my garmin.com username and password in vain, no work.  Well apparently there is a different login that gets created if you happen to set your login ID for Garmin.com as your email address. That won't work for Garmin connect (which is where you go to review data and dashboards on your training, as well as plan, etc...  So, when you go to Garmin connect, now you click the forgot userID link and it will email you your userid for Garmin Connect.<br /><br />Understand, there are two web sites, garmin.com account manages the account and details about your watch.  Garmin Connect or connect.garmin.com, which is where your data goes.<br /><br />Once I got all that sorted out, I was ready to start my first spin training session.  Well that was another project.  So I set up my plan through Garmin Connect and transferred it to my watch.  Only to find out that target heart rates, etc... don't transfer to the 405.  It apparently has limitations so all that transferred was my interval times.  Now that is just plain useless.  I can't believe Garmin would have that kind of limitation on their high-end watch.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, when I set everything up, Garmin Connect had a section called \\"health\\" that let's you track body fat and a bunch of other health related metrics using a body fat analyzer they recommend.  Guess what though, it is compatible with every Garmin watch but the 405, yet they recommend it.  So I bought that, then found out it wasn't compatible.  Now waiting for it to come in so I can return it.<br /><br />I signed up for a subscription of TrainingPeaks, saw in another review that is better software.  I'll try that and review later.<br /><br />Not sure if I have a lot to learn so I will update this review as I dolearn more about this watch.  But many limitations and will take a little while to figure out. Hopefully I'll get there.  But at first glance, the 405 has some serious compatibility issues with ANT enabled devices, why bother call it an ANT + compatible watch when it doesn't seem to work with half the ANT enabled devices?<br /><br />That said, read somewhere it wasn't compatible with my Schwin MPower Console, but found out it was, just takes a little while (up to 3 mins) for my MPower to recognize the watch.<br /><br />More to come as I embark on my new fitness journey. I'll keep you posted.<br /><br />UPDATE: Returned the Garmin 405 series watch.  Very inferior compared to the 610.  Bought a 610 and love it.  If you are considering one of these Garmin FR watches, go with the 610.  Much better product.  Syncs with all my fitness equipment.  My fat analyzer, my MPower for my AC Performance plus, and much more.  A much better product.  Spend the $100 bucks more for a much better product (the Forerunner 610)
B008XK69S6|5.0|The best kindle fire has to offer I finally found a music player for my fire HD because the default doesn't play my music neither do the other media player apps in the app store but once again I recommend this to anyone with the same problem it's  completely worth it :D
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wow what a great game!This game will keep you very occupied. This game is great for all kids even BABYS!I love this game and no disappointed in this game.Also what's great about it its free.Also its realq
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The headline should annoy most Whovians.  Eccleston brings a toughest to the character that was missing while Piper is simply marvelous.  There isn't a disappointing episode in the season.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The problem with this series is that you get addicted to it very easily. I have watched the series and have enjoyed every episode.
B003NS2T9G|3.0|No one trusts anyone else, we get it.  That seems to be the premise of the entire season and starts to wear by the third episode or so.  Each character does something stupid that imperils the rest and the planet and Captain Jack has to save everyone.  It's not all bad.  It's just nowhere near as enjoyable as Doctor Who.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Somehow our recordings got canceled for several of the season 3 episodes had to watch the first 6 on here to know what was going on awesome Amazon lets you buy just a episode. LOVE I!!!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|This was a dissappointing read.  The main character was portrayed as weak and often stupid.  And there was only one possible ending which was pretty easy to guess.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Just Addicted what can I say had to buy!! Got to be ready for 3 then 4 in Oct.!YAY Love this show
B00CHILW64|4.0|Great Movie! Very intense.  Naomi Watts does a great job as the lead actress, and Ewan McGregor is good as well.
B00445RHKI|5.0|I've found this show during a very difficult period of life. I can count on a strong laugh during every episode.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|find the pieces and solve each room. hope for more levels soon. it took me about two hours to finish the first 10.
1455121932|5.0|Wheat Belly is one of the most vital books, in my opinion, if you are wanting to regain health and make changes to impact it for the good.  A must read!
B005HED11Y|5.0|The quality of the filming is better than I would imagine possible.  The tv's and movie screens of the time never looked this good, so why was this site's shot in such great quality?  Scenes are colorful, and the new animations are tasteful for the era, yet not overdone.
B00D37UQ1K|1.0|I couldn't finish watching this movie. The dialogue with the wonderer was too much. The flash backs were usually a montage of cliches. I think the concept could have been great, but it takes a sharp left from sci-fi to teenage melodrama. It's not even a good teenage melodrama at that. This review is written by someone who loves hardcor sci-fi (\\"Dune\\") and teen movies (\\"I Am Number Four\\").
B00BESFWBY|3.0|Interesting storyline, good photography.  Generally a good movie, but a bit slow moving at times.  Some parts were a little boring and not necessary.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Very good game. It is challenging but not overly so.  Very relaxing. I love the rebuilding the tree. The characters are cute. The game is not really free but it a small charge that is worth it.
030758836X|5.0|This book was amazing! I recommend it to everyone I know. Gillian Flynn is an incredible author and just when you think you have it all figured out she switches it up!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love it. So much fun to play. Love the mystery of what fish will move in next based on my hard work.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|I am a big Taylor swift fan and this album does not disappoint!! I downloaded it so I could hear it right away!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Classic super hero story leaving off where Thor ended and throwing in a few others for a good mix of characters.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|My 2 yo son loves this movie right now and we have multiple copies where ever we go! Super cute movie for kids.
B005W0ARFQ|4.0|You can't go wrong with a Philip Kerr novel if you want a good page turner. A good story well told.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love puzzle games.  This one is both challenging and fun. Its fun getting to put it all together. A great thinking game.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I was surprised to really like this movie.  Its a cornier version of Glee with better music.  There were some moments of lude humor, but that didn't bother me.  Also- Anna Kendrick sings?  What a difference from Twilight!  Love the song &#34;cups&#34;.  If you like funny, cute, musical type movies with a happy ending then this is for you.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'll bet most of you reading these reviews will have heard all of what I am about to say but frankly, I don't care...  When you have read as many BAD books as I have you find yourself wanting to scream out loud and to the world that \\"hey I finally found a really, really, really great book\\" and then you discover your like the last person on earth who hadn't read it - or heard of it? Weird...  My 21 yr. old God-Son laughed when I said I had found a really great book called Enders Game - he looked adoringly and said I was a few years behind...<br /><br />Oh well - I can catch up... :)<br /><br />But seriously - What a treat!!! Although I stayed up late way too many night and was groggy as all the next day those chapters were worth every minute...  There just never seemed to be a good stopping point - nowhere I was willing to say - ok, here is a good boring part, ill put it down and sleep a while... Yeah - didn't happen...<br /><br />Thank you Card - You have found a loyal fan, I'm already onto book two...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not just for children or young adults, this book has a concept and storyline that facinates even the adult mind!<br />Once you start this book, you have to finish the whole trilogy!
B000F8O35U|5.0|This movie is amazing. Saw it when I was little and I still watch it till this day on. By the way, I'm 18 and I still enjoy this movie!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome I never thought that amazon was gonna bring this app to the appstore.really good game I like the minions
1400069807|4.0|What a book. Amazing to see how the corporations trick our minds as well as our bodies in purchasing their products.  Very easy to read, happy I purchased.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. keeps u thinking. i cant wait for more levels to come out. wish I knew that
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As usual, King's writing draws you into the story, and you can't put the book down.  I am an avid reader, and his books are still my favorites after all these years.  He is an incredible author and this book is no exception to the quality of his body of work.
B00ATP24NW|5.0|This is a great album or CD as the kids call it.  The RAdioActive video is awesome.  You will love it.  Cant go wrong with this in your collection
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Similar to bones or ncis where every show there is a problem and they solve it. While I don't usually like that particular format it works well for this show as the break it up well with the character intereaction and plot of the season and or show. Overall good show.
B008XOXGL0|5.0|Without a doubt, this will be a classic album. It sounds very warm on vinyl as well, so I would recommend it over digital.
B0029EDMEG|4.0|Always enjoy Tom Selleck, he plays alcoholic washed out police officer that finds a second chance in Paradise.  Excellent cast and plot keeps your interest.  Also Hallmark movie channel runs the series often so catch it there with commercials or Prime no commercials and enjoy!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I have always enjoyed viewing the Good Wife and I am very, extremely happy to able to get it on my Kindle.  With my busy schedule sometimes I have missed some episodes, Now I can watch them all with no commercials.  Absolutely great.  Anyone who has not watched the Good Wife should-very entertaining and no violence..
1594136238|5.0|When my book club chose this book, I wasn't sure about the subject matter, but boy was I wrong!! What great writing and an insight into the justice system.  I would highly recommend it......and I have!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|*UPDATE*<br />I talked to the support and they didn't know why it was doing this. But once I contacted them, it stopped. I can only assume that it was from the one rate this app popup I had received while not connected to the internet.  As my issue is resolved, 5 STARS!<br />__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Let me start out by saying that I LOVE this app. I use it at work and at home and it is very relaxing, fun and easy to use.<br /><br />Now the reason I rate it 1 Star...<br />I updated the App 2 days ago and now everytime I access the app, it says I need Internet Connectivity to run it.<br />Before the update, I didn't have to have it connected to the internet and it worked just fine. What happened?<br /><br />I use a Galaxy Tab 2 that does not have Data Access so I only use WiFi when I'm able to. I see nothing in the permission on it needing Internet Access, just reading phone status. Please update it or roll it back to the way it was before.<br /><br />NOTE: I can access the app and quickly turn on a sound or 2 that will continue to run after the app has to close. It's extremely annoying to have to open the app, find what you want to hear quickly, let it close out, open it again to find another sound to go with the previous sound and then to have the app close again.
B0058O84G0|4.0|This takes you back to I st world war & gives you a peek in those times in very entertaining manner...without being bogged down by the history...
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Was drawn in from the first page. The author was able to interweave all these rich characters into one story, seen from different aspects, that takes you through the dramatic era of the first world war. I'm on the second book now and highly enjoying it!! It continues on with the offspring of the first book, set in the years before and through the second world war.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Was challenging enough but not too difficult so it was fun. Only giving 4 stars until they get more than ten levels...great free game!
B009D0LBRO|5.0|Okay, maybe not the best game ever, but this game is right up there with the best of them. It's easily one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. I've enjoyed Rayman since the original. I very much doubt I will be abandoning this series anytime soon.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|It's a classic.  My kids are now old enough and they really enjoyed it.  I enjoyed seeing it again.  Love it!
B000TERK14|4.0|A fun CD. I saw them live and had an absolute blast. They certainly know how to carry a show. I'd recommend them.
B009WUBERW|3.0|A fun mindless 1 1/2 hour of entertainment. Just sit back and enjoy many of the older action actors do what most of us know, that anyone in their sixties would never think of doing. I enjoyed it anyway.
B007V65R54|4.0|I don't have much interest in the political ideas contained within the book. That said, when applied to other areas, this book is filled with information about the usage of statistics. Very helpful read if you're into that sort of thing.
B000U6BT40|5.0|The humor and drama and the one with the least IQ is often the smartest. Common sense goes a long way
B002RXMG00|5.0|It's always been a great movie. Anthony Perkins did a stunning job as Norman. CSI would have had a hay day in that bathroom!
B00DM12ANO|4.0|Romeo and Juliet with a science fiction twist. Don't pay too much attention to the physics and just enjoy it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This escape game had just the right degree of difficulty. Graphics were very cool and clues were quite clever. Anxiously awaiting new levels!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I thought Season 2 was raunchy and just plain bad.  Season 2 was really good and back to good morals like in Season 1.
0385341008|5.0|It takes about 10 pages in to get used to the writing style (the story is written as letters), but excellent once you get into it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series. Shows life in England before WWII. Eager for season 4 which begins on January 5, 2014. I would recommend series.
0007105045|5.0|Tree and Leaf takes you to another world that feels strange yet familiar.  Leaf by Niggle is a must read.
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|Ordered for my grandson and he loves it and uses it in conjunction with his other Octonauts to create scenes and situations.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Yep, I was put off by the lackluster trailers, confused marketing and negative reviews so avoided this in the theater. However, when I rented the Blu-Ray to occupy my son on a wet afternoon we both loved the film. A beautifully realized old school fantasy adventure.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I am a big fan of this whole series and this book is no exception - I liked it almost more than her previous psy-changeling novels.
B002LC2DQ4|3.0|I purchased this item because<br />a) I needed one, and<br />b) it was the cheapest.<br />I'm assuming the product, an xD card and an xD card the world around.  When a card is full, and I've squeezed out all the bad shots, keeping only the really important, precous &#34;Keepers&#34; -- I get a new card and archive the old one. My great, great, grandchildren may find them one day.<br /><br />But this one came in a plane plastic business card sized zip-lok baggie, and a plane bubble-pack lined envelope, from CHINA.<br /><br />Oh yes, I ordered it because I had to get the order up over the dollar amount Amazon requires to ship anything these days. They had been holding several other orders 'hostage' because they weren't worth enough. So, basically I was padding the order.<br /><br />THEN I found out that ... this one did NOT qualify because Amazon wasn't shipping it.<br /><br />The card is now in use and works fine, so far as I know. But the description says &#34;Retail Package&#34; which it was NOT. So, Amazon either unintentionally or intentionally misrepresented it.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I hope to share the success of those that went before me. Finally a lifestyle I can live with.<br /><br />Thank you&#34;
B009KUWWW0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I was  transported to the middle ages with a very clear description of the social, economic and religious situations of the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like gameplay of it.its fun but also addicting sometimes.i like the different themes all around the world.miami,paris,new york,tokyo... .
B004XMMSZG|5.0|We have an old Bose SoundDock that doesn't work with newer docked items like iPhone 4 and up, or fancy devices like these.  But we have an adapter <[[ASIN:B00495JZTY B00495JZTY]]> that converts the output so that we can use the DockBoss with the Bose speaker and it works great.<br /><br />We keep it plugged in all the time, and just connect to it when we're ready to blast music from across the room.  We get so much more use out of the SoundDock now that we can connect iPhones, iPads, etc.
B007WPM7SO|2.0|truly boring, long, long, long, longing looks between the lovers, with not much else. Needs more character development and demonstration of behaviors.  That's all.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|The show is well done and the characters are interesting to follow.  Similar to Downton Abbey but different enough to worth watching.
B0000640S1|5.0|on time and in good  work good  and i will like more  to see like that  think you  very much
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These are by far the clearest, most revealing headphones I have ever worn.  The sound is perfectly engineered to pull out individual instruments, push them to the front when they need to be heard, and then push them to the back when they are quiet.  But even when they are  quiet or buried in the mix, they can still be heard if you know what you're looking for.<br /><br />The bass is not great, and neither is the volume or ambient noise isolation (due to the open ear design), but if you're buying these, you're not looking for cheap, commercial sound.  These are excellent for one thing: sonic clarity.
B004UJTG6Q|1.0|I didn't like that book it was too old for me.<br />I suggest not to read until high school or college.
B00AB7IA1S|3.0|downloaded and functions fine on my first gen kindle<br /><br />this is an easy game to figure out (common sense - ship moves direction it is blown) I like that it has a good tutorial / hint system. I also like that it had so many levels to keep you busy, but it is a bit too easy at least through all of the &quot;one &quot; levels - my need to finish things will have me finding out if it gets really hard. my biggest thing is that there is no scoring or 'stars ' - a reason to replay it (better your score) - you finish a level and head to the next.... cute idea but a bit bland overall - I would not pay for this game and am quite glad I didn't.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Saw it in the theaters and had to have it! Beautiful story, great performances. You forget there are subtitles. A+
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|It was a cute movie... pretty slow in the beginning, but it definitely improved after that  Friends said it was &#34;hysterical&#34; or &#34;funniest movie ever&#34;.  I have to disagree.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is very challenging but in a good way. Some you can do in seconds others in minutes. I like the range of the levels and how they time you! The only thing wrong with this app is that the game is sensitive. :(
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This was my go to app for storm tracking in out area. Not any more! Deleted it out. When you all decide to undo your scrappy update maybe then I will come back. I am only giving it one star because it won't let me do a minus!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Ever start reading  book that you like so much that you try to slow down reading it because you don't want it to be over?  That's how I feel about Gone Girl!  It earned its place on the best seller list.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|more levels please..really cool free app that adds unique twist. causes you to actually think and remember ...I would recommend this app
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|So I got this as a gift and I'm really stoked about it, hence writing this review after I've only had the thing out of the box for maybe 45 minutes.  So you know, take this with a grain of salt I suppose.  I can update if anything noteworthy changes in its performance or if I notice something new.<br /><br />I'm really excited to have a proper gaming mouse and actually intend to use it for graphic design and illustration purposes as well.  The only problem I see is that it's kind of large and ever so slightly awkward for my hand.  There are three buttons for your thumb, and I can't really reach the one farthest away from me (which is programmed as CTRL, and I use in my work) without some sort of awkward repositioning.  Don't get me wrong, I CAN reach this button, but awkwardly and it's going to take some getting used to naturally.  I can probably reassign CTRL to a different button, but it would be nice if I could simply reach all three comfortably.<br /><br />But honestly, this is a really nifty, cool-looking mouse, and works nicely for this beginner gamer.  It made a wonderful gift. :D<br /><br />Edit: If you activate sticky keys, this makes the programmable thumb buttons MUCH more practical to use.
1401937519|5.0|This is a true story and great discription of what she saw and felt.  I learned a lot from this book and bought 10 copies and everyone enjoyed ti.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.
B009186JYI|5.0|A fantastic film. Picture quality is outstanding. If you are into the classic Brian Jones era Rolling Stones this film is for you. I can watch it over and over.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|New and different way to the Snow White story.  I enjoyed it very much, wouldn't recommend it for little ones
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and fun. There were only ten levels which was disappointing since I completed in one evening. At least I didn't receive a message requiring me to purchase more levels.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Enjoyed the books and now the movie look forward to seeing the next one.  Recommend it for any one who likes adventure
B0086700CM|5.0|it cool my brother loves this game I like it too my cousins. have it too on the nook we have a kindle fire
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was very challenging and entertaining. Though there were some grammatical errors and missing words in the conversations I still found myself hooked.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I play this on Facebook, so it so nice to be able to do it on my Kindle!!  This game is fun and addictive!  Only con you only get 5 lives a time ;-)
B0091W2PGA|5.0|I really enjoy reading all the different types of books from Harlequin.  These are the types of books I love to read and I really like the series types of books.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|How do you play? No idea. I click on everything. Even solve the horse puzzle. Nothing goes into the boxes on the right. Instructions are not helpful.
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|I need to purchase this software to watch HD movies on my Kindle and my Kindle Fire.  This has been great to watch movies on my Kindle Fire and Kindle.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|this game is boring because you have u have to buy every thing. and when I first got it I thought it was fun it wasn't.
B0049J3QNG|5.0|this dvd arrived quickly and of course everyone loves this movie.  I got it for my 2 year old granddaughter who loves Woody and Jessie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game with some pretty cool puzzles. It becomes tough and all you want to do is get to the next lever. Addicting.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have been looking for a game like this so much since must. I found myself thinking about the game at work. I felt challenged many times. I will play the next one when it comes out!
B003L1ZXM0|5.0|It would be nice if we could all learn to &#34;speak&#34; to our spouses the way we &#34;should&#34;.  Great book.
B0064MGU98|5.0|awesome show cannot wait to watch ALL the episodes! I rewatch every episode and cannot wait for the new season.
B0002NIRIC|5.0|This is definitely the best string care item which you must have in your kit. Easy to use and it is durable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an AWESOME game! What you do is swap left to go left and swap right to go right and swap backwards to do a frontline and swap forward to jump. Try to get as many bananas as you can.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|It is a good product. The DVDs were ok, I could watch the whole concert in a really good quality. I wish I had a blue-ray player to buy a blue-ray of this concert, it must be amazing! I would recommend this product to anyone.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Very powerful science-fiction story, purchased the extended version because it has a segment on it where Paul, his father, the Fremen man, the Mentat and the man who plays Picard on &#34;Star Trek Next Generation&#34; are all sitting together in a room, and 'Picard' plays this guitar-like instrument.  It's really something, and they cut that completely out of the regular version.
B00004Y2QT|5.0|I am a HUGE Prince Fan. I saw this on Pay-Per-View back when it was first aired live and I was glad to get the DVD. Prince is amazing an amazing performer by himself, but he has The Time, Lenny Kravits, Larry Graham, Maceo Parker & people from his band that turn it out. I really enjoyed this concert again.
145211207X|3.0|great for seeing nice color keys but not really reveal overall process of pre production. good book but lack of information I wish
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|My 15 yr old daughter had been asking me to take her to see Cirque Du Soleil for the last few years. However, a $60-$70 ticket is cost prohibitive for a family of 6. I was thrilled when I saw this offered on Amazon. The story is a bit slow in the beginning, but once you get through the 1st 15 minutes or so, the actual circus performances are amazing. My daughters, range in age from 8-15, all sat for over an hour watching.<br /><br />Just to let you know -there is somewhat of a storyline, but there is little-to-no dialogue. If you are Cirque Du Soleil fan or is you enjoy the arialists and acrobats at a normal circus, you will probably enjoy this movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is not what i expected but is fun any way. I like how the levels grow more difficult each round. I think it is great for all skill levels.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A series of inter related characters and their stories. Time shifts backward and forward. As w his other books, provides glimpses into life in Afghanistan both per and post war. Very good read.
B0081336FO|5.0|This show appeals to me on so many levels. The dialogue is great, the pacing excellent, the chemistry between Cumberbatch and Freeman is fabulous. You can't find a better show on TV.
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|Kids loved it! Perfect for a family movie night! Not too scary for the girl but adventurous enough for the boy!
B007PF7MGS|5.0|This is an amazing book for everyone who is seeking for health and an ideal body weight. You can't fail with this program since you'll always be satisfied and happy!
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|Great book, a real page turner , could have ended a few chapters before it did right after the climax..but overall a good read....appreciated the philosophical stuff
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|i really like this show, i wish it had not been cancelled.  i have watched this series more that a few times...lol
B004GJ1XU2|4.0|Every time I see The Big Chill listed to be playing, I'm impelled to tune in.  I love Kevin Kline and also Glenn Close, but most all the actors in it are very good.  And the music is fabulous--Baby Boomers Heaven.  After friends gather at the funeral of a &#34;close&#34; friend who took his life, the film explores the various characters' feelings about the person and life as such.  I always find it interesting, but I have to question how deeply they all were with the friend that died.  They really didn't know him and he is made out to be this very wonderful person, full of life, but obviously he wasn't and none of his friends saw it coming. I think you'll find this film very interesting, I'm still pondering why I do.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I loved the music to this. I don't have a physical copy of this yet because I just recently ordered this. But since I ordered from Amazon, I got the digital copy of the album included for buying it. So I played it on Amazon Cloud Player and it is amazing. The music is epic and incredible. I can't stop myself from listening to it over and over again.<br /><br />I liked it better than The Dark Knight Rises soundtrack. There's just something different about this that makes you love the Man Of Steel soundtrack. Hans Zimmer does a fantastic job at scoring each movie he has done, but I'm completely blown away with this one. My favorite tracks on this album are \\"Flight\\", \\"General Zod\\" and \\"What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?\\"(which happens to be the longer version of \\"An ideal of hope\\")<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I do have the physical copy. I just forgot to update. It is really nice, the booklet and the casing...it is perfect. :) Definitely worth the buy for any hardcore Superman fan.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it  was a good read...Reading the book has encouraged me to actually want to see the movie now!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I have a free weather app on my Kindle HD that worked fine, but I found this one to be better. Worth the money with all the information anyone would need. Highly recommend. Well worth getting.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I realy liked the game it was fun I enjoyed it very very very much because it was fun fun fun so fun
B00C81AVNU|5.0|I was able to relive the show.  I like listening to the songs and thinking about the great story that Lauper, Mitchell, and Feirstein put together from the original movie.
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|Kicking off the album with Provision is awesome!!  Phenomenal album, some truly great new stuff from ABR!  If you liked Leveler you will love this new album!  Favorite song would have to be the single Fault Line.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The only problem with game is the lack of instructions at the very beginning.  At least - little old ladies like me need more insttructions.  Other than that - enjoy playing it.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a delightfully addicting game. Easy to play and relaxing way to spend time. Cute story line and I like the graphics.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have only been playing for 2 days and I'm already hooked.  Great graphics, and if you like hidden objects games then I suggest trying this game.  I might not have tried the game, if it hadn't been for the last reviewer.  Just because there is an option to buy upgrades, doesn't mean you have to.... that can be disabled on your kindle.  It's just like that old saying, &quot;If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you?&quot;  Please rate the game for what it's actually about, so ppl can decide if they want to purchase it too.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|Great movie. Dustin Hoffman's acting was exceptional.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys well written and well acted movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Needs more mobs and spawners and put hard core in there its funer last a couple servers that reaches across the country or world more people will by it oh yay and some cool mods thank
B004VFMCWE|5.0|Finally a Michael Douglas role that highlights his diverse acting skills (I.e. he's not a hot, confident banker). Riveting, great acting and suspenseful movie!
B003QS9TKU|5.0|This is a nice family movie without all the violence. Good for all ages. We watched this movie and it was very entertaining.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this app to an extent. I just wish that it was more of a challenge and each level a little longer.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are okay. could be addictive. You'll love it after a while but there's plenty of things that you can do.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|excelent, this was a gift for someone I know and she love it.<br />it s ok i do not want to write more
1582701709|3.0|Positive thinking helps, morally. But the way it has been interpreted to work through this book, will seldom do.<br /><br />Wishful thinking may motivate a person to strive to work towards the wish, but will not work until the person acts upon it. It is a dumb to say \\"Sit on your big fat a*** and keeping thinking about something and it will come searching for you\\", never , it won't happen. If you have to achieve something, you think about it first, plan on it, keep a positive attitude and ACT upon it until you get it. The secret is ACT, not just THINK.<br /><br />Rich are rich not merely by thinking, but, by virtue of their proper planning and implementing their thoughts. Few others are just lucky to have inherited a lot of riches. Do you think Paris Hilton read the Secret? She is a filthy rich girl not because she thought about getting rich, just because is damn lucky.<br /><br />After all the positive thinking, hard work and action, it finally rests on LUCK.<br /><br />Who in this world wants to think to be poor? Who wants to think to be unhappy? Not a single soul. Everyone wants to be rich and happy. If the logic in this book really works, then no person on this earth should be poor and unhappy.<br /><br />This is a good read to boost your morale but it cannot in any capacity be your guide for success.
B00133KFGW|5.0|The soundtrack is very creative and refreshing!!!  The acting be the boy in the movie, along with the music deserve an A+ rating!!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Super Game, I love the timer version you have to think fast and the puzzles are limitless. Highly recommended free app
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|House of Cards is fantastic. Why? Well, start with a talented director like David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network), or Joel Schumacher (The Lost Boys, Phone Booth, The Client), throw in 2-time Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey (The Usual Suspects, American Beauty), Golden Globe nominee Robin Wright (Forrest Gump, The Pledge), and a slew of other talented cast members. Add to that a razor-sharp script, nail-biting tension, wryly funny moments, realistic situations and drama, and characters that allow each actor to shine, and, well, you have something fantastic!<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is deliciously cunning and pure evil as Francis Underwood. He is an actor that gives consistently good performances (Like James Gandolfini or Gary Oldman), and he is positively riveting here! His habit of breaking the fourth wall brings the audience closer into his tangled web of deceit, lies, and cunning! And it is delicious to behold. Robin Wright gives perhaps her BEST role yet as Francis Underwood's kind but brilliant wife Claire! The rest of the distinguished cast is on par. No faults there!<br /><br />The scripts are very entertaining, and cover a wide variety of subjects. There's humour in here too. Just look at Frank's chillingly realistic onscreen meltdown (\\"You wanna play the vowel game? U - O - I - AN - APOLOGY\\"). The tit-for-tat protests between two rival groups come straight from something you'd see on the news, and make for entertaining watching!<br /><br />On the whole, House of Cards has a lot of strong points! It's perhaps funner than it's British predecessor, and the writing is sharp and strong, the plots realistic, the character's deliciously deceitful, the acting is superb, and the direction, cinematography, and score are all fantastic. It is an underrated show that should get more recognition.<br /><br />But perhaps we should not find it so entertaining; it is very relevant to modern-day American politics, and, while fictional, gives us a chilling look inside the tangled, pitch-black web of lies, deceit, and empty promises that comprise the house of cards of politics today - a scary world where no one can trust anybody else, where the public are played like pawns, and where the most ruthless, cunning, and cold triumph over the weak.<br /><br />P.S. See the BBC British counterpart starring Ian Richardson. It is also excellent and riveting: [[ASIN:B009Z59ZNE House Cards Trilogy Original Remastered]]<br />P.P.S. Suggested MPAA Rating: R-Rated, for strong language and some sexual, drug, and alcohol content.k inside the tangled, pitch-black web of lies, deceit, and empty promises that comprise the house of cards of politics today - a scary world where no one can trust anybody else, where the public are played like pawns, and where the most ruthless, cunning, and cold triumph over the weak.<br /><br />P.S.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I LOVE this game. It starts off way too easy and escalates to pretty hard, it really gets your mind working. Probably the best free app I have ever gotten
B0070YDOT8|1.0|This game would not work for me...kept saying \\"loading\\", but when I opened, I could never get it to work!! Spent at least 20 or 30 minutes trying!!!!!
B002GMSMHS|5.0|The product is just as I expected it. It holds enough pictures and downloads at a reasonable speed. I would recommend it for older cameras.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It was hard at first but I got the hang of it. Oh one other thing it's free so get it now
B00DF0POXA|3.0|The album was okay, but not his best. Three songs worth buying the other five where not. Not worth buying the whole album.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's pretty cool but the energy system in it is the only down fall a lot of stuff are worse than this one in my personal opinion
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a really great game to play! I was definitely stumped quite a few times. It was the best puzzle game I have played in a really long time. Wish it had been longer, so I look forward to the next Room :-)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really fun game gotta download it! My daughter won't stop playing it I recommend this game good pass time game
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Fascinating concept.......my sister recommended it to me.......and I recommend it to all of you.  What if.........and loved the glimpses into the late 50's and early 60's.  Mr. King, you've done it again.
0061122416|5.0|Excellent and involving till the end. One of the most touching books I ever read in my life. I highly recommend it to everyone and especially to everyone who gave up on their dreams. This book will show you the way to your Personal Legend!<br /><br />The Alchemist involved me from the start. I read this book in one sip. Really, when I started I couldn't put it away till the last page. It might look like it's a novel, but if you read between the lines, you will notice that a novel is just a surface. What is really deep in this story is the personal journey to discover yourself and reach your dreams. I love the way Paulo Coelho presented this journey. I love to dream and reach my dreams, so all the stories about somebody having big dreams and achieving them touches me, especially this one.<br /><br />Santiago is the main character of the story. Actually he can represent everyone on the earth who follows his own dreams. He is just a symbol of will, persistence and victory of life. The story tells his journey to discover himself. Actually, he takes the road to follow his dreams which he saw when he was sleeping. The entire journey is a metaphoric transformation to discover yourself. I don't want to tell all the story here, but can say that everyone of us has our own journey in life. The question is do we take the road? Or do we swim with the river?<br /><br />This book made me understand that life consists of the journey to reach the dreams. It's not the end result that makes all the sense. It's the personal journey that makes it really mater. It's the Personal Legend that you create on the way to reaching your goals. Everything in life is really just a hand length away. The question is what length journey you have to go to see those things. You have to be ready to achieve success, otherwise it will pass through. The personal journey makes you ready when it comes. And this book has everything in it what you need to be a champion in life.<br /><br />So, can you read between the lines? Can you see more than just a trip to Egypt? Share your thoughts.een the lines? Can you see more than just a trip to Egypt? Share your thoughts.
0399159347|4.0|My first encounter with Liane Moriarty was with \\"What Alice Forgot,\\" which convinced me that this was an author I had to add to my \\"must get all books by her\\" list. I enjoyed \\"The Hypnotist's Love Story\\" but not nearly as much as \\"What Alice Forgot.\\" Still, when I saw she had a new book out, I knew I needed to get my hands on it ASAP. \\"The Husband's Secret\\" is just as good as \\"What Alice Forgot\\" -- perhaps even better! Intertwining the stories of three women (Cecelia, Tess and Rachel) who are all tied together in ways they are not fully aware, \\"The Husband's Secret\\" grabs you from the beginning and has you turning pages as fast as you can. I read it in two days and handed it over to my friend, who gobbled it up just as fast. What makes Moriarty's characters come alive is that they are so darn real and relatable. Their internal conversations and thought processes feel real and authentic ... and it doesn't hurt that they are often quite amusing as well. Make no mistake, though, this isn't \\"light\\" fiction. Moriarty takes on some big issues in this book -- serious problems that aren't easily overcome. I think what makes her books so good are that she can handle the big serious topics but with a deft touch that doesn't make them depressing and dour. If you're new to Moriarty's books, this is an excellent starting place. If you're already a fan, what are you waiting for? This is a wonderful addition to her ever-growing ouevre and I, for one, am already waiting for her next book.
B00AB7IA1S|4.0|I have a KF HD 8.9\\". No matter what I do the game wants to display the screen upside down.  I may update my rating when I am actually able to view the game in the correct orientation.<br /><br />UPDATE 07/10/2013 - An update was pushed to my device and the app orientation is now correct.  The game play mechanics are pretty straight-forward, but not all that challenging.  Not a bad time waster
B008KYOCA2|2.0|This is a very well laid out calendar. However, I can't seem to figure out<br />How to sync it with my gmail calendar and that is critical for<br />me.
B00AB7IA1S|4.0|From a post I just wrote for Fire dot KindleNationDaily dot com:<br />This app only has an average review rating of 3/5 stars, but I checked out those 1-star reviews myself and found that most of them are complaining about issues I'm not seeing when I play the game myself. For example, many of the 1-starrers say the game loads upside down. On my Fire HD 7\\", the game did initially load upside down, but rotating my Fire 180 degrees solved that problem. I assume those who mention the upside down problem are saying that when they rotate their devices the game turns itself upside down again, making it impossible to play no matter how you rotate your device, but I just didn't have that problem.<br /><br />Another common complaint from negative reviews is that the game isn't challenging enough, or that gameplay isn't varied enough, but that wasn't my experience at all. Granted, I don't tend to play a lot of very complex games, or games that demand rapid reflexes, but to me this game is just as enjoyable as most physics-based puzzle games. It's very similar to the game apps where you try to lay track for trains to get them into their stations without crashing into each other. I like that you can plan out your strategy and fan placements first, then see how it works. And if it doesn't work, you can try again.<br /><br />The only bug I found was that if you're not connected to wifi the first time you start the game, you get an Amazon App Store error that tells you to re-download. I was concerned that this might be a red flag for spyware, if the game wouldn't let me play until I was connected to wifi, but I found that turning on wifi, re-starting the game, and then turning wifi off again worked just fine. The next time I started the game, it loaded with no problems.<br /><br />The graphics are very cute and the game begins with a great tutorial. Also, there are no excessive permissions.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I have waited for months for this book to hit shelves. when I saw the preorder alert hit my Kindle. I purchased it. As I read the first few chapter I felt it lack the spark of the first 2.. Then when I got to last chapter, I already knew it wouldn't end. I thought the end of the book was disappointing.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Weather Channel should have left this app alone! It was clean &amp; easy to use,  now they've messed it up adding pictures. I'm not looking for pretty,  just a straightforward weather app.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|Great delivery and in perfect condition. Ordered for my Dad, it's his favorite movie of all time and we have not been able to find it in any store in DVD form so this was a special treat for him!
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|I had hoped this would finally be the movie that showed us the true character of Abraham Lincoln - and perhaps, at times, it did.  However, the movie only covered a few months of Lincoln's life prior to his assassination in 1865, mostly dealing with passing the 13th amendment.  I would like to have seen an earlier Lincoln as well, had a chance to grow into the characters, vs. being thrust into one particular moment in time as I was.  Daniel Day-Lewis was brilliant in his portrayal of Lincoln, to his credit.  In the end, I was simply left wanting more.
B000002L9Y|5.0|I truly love every song on this CD. Such a great disc for road trips too! Catchy tunes, great harmonies, fantastic CD.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|There is an art to taking metal music and making it melodic without losing its core principle, and no one does that better than Megadeth.  They rock as hard as anyone, and yet the songs are extremely well constructed and flawlessly performed - the musicianship of this band in unsurpassed.  This record is another in an incredible series of releases this band has put forth - they have been firing on all cylinders for several years now.  Highly recommend this record.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The story itself is an easy read, the plot isn't incredibly complicated, and it's good for young adults. The formatting for the Kindle though leaves much to be desired, since there were breaks in the paragraphs where there aren't meant to be any.
B001GKJ2FW|3.0|Movie is good somewhat family friendly. Its almost like a musical Kids like it and Wife like so there you go its a winner
0763657875|5.0|While browsing through a bookstore (some still do exist), I ran across this wonderful book. When I teach \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", I bring in DK travel guides and other visually rich books to give my students a sense of the time and place when Shakespeare wrote. I saw \\"Pop-Up London\\" as a great resource for kids to get more interested in conveying this background information. Upon receiving \\"Pop-Up London\\" the other day, I was even more surprised at how well done this book actually is, not only on an artistic level (the pop-ups are visually stunning), but on an intellectual level as well. If one looks on the back of the pop-ups, there are inside views, descriptions of the buildings, interesting factoids. Other trivia and flaps also abound among the pages, so the Reader does feel like a tourist exploring, roaming, discovering this great city. Can't wait to share this book with my class! I know it will be a hit, and generate further inquiry for them.
B0095P31L6|5.0|If you like animation and you like 3D worlds, join this one for fun and adventure and you won't be disappointed. The characters were thought out and the graphics are some of the best.  Mostly, it's just entertaining - what more do you want?
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I love the TED talks. This app is a great way to have all the TED talks in one place
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Fun and a little over the top, but a great show to.get yourself lost in.  It is easy to become invested invthe characters because everyone can see part of themselves in this show.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. I can't wait to read the last one. If I still taught English, this trilogy would be in my classroom.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome!!!!! Cant wait til next season!!! Must watch for everone!! Darly Dixion is my favorite!!!! Sad to see some others gone!
B002QHH22O|5.0|Love Steel Panther!!!! Saw them in concert in Kc was well worth the trip. Really want to see them in Vegas
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book. Could not put it down. Read it all in one night. Lost too much sleep because of it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a great games for adults an children great graphics and really cute for children this is my first review
B00190OHD6|4.0|Good movie to watch by yourself on a gloomy day. Very much enjoyed the entire cast of actors. Well written.
B00190OHD6|5.0|If you enjoy corny, romantic movies, you will love this one!  And the scenery of Ireland, although not extensive, is spectacular.
B00355L2TU|5.0|She works you out hard and fast.  I love this DVD and I can't wat to get to the other levels.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The characters in this series have become old friends by the second season, and I find myself forgetting that these are professional actors and actresses playing their parts.  This series is so real, the settings so magnificent, and the story so compelling.  The second season keeps me wondering what is going to happen next!  And things keep happening.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I really enjoy this game its a great time passer and if you like puzzles then its perfect for you :)
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|Well written, concise and fun, this is a classic beach read. This novella was just the right length to keep you interested and just short enough to have you wanting more. In fact, I can't wait for book 2 which will hopefully expand a little on the relationship dynamics of the threesome which really seems intriguing but was only sparingly played out in book 1, while of course continuing the bioterror plotline.<br /><br />The stereotypical characters may border on comical, particularly the kids, but make you wonder if the author is half poking fun at them and Hollywood in general. There is a lot to relate to at least with Neil, who tells the story from his POV. His persona of being \\"5 seconds too late\\" and just below his other family members' in intelligence seems appropriately self deprecating and likable. It's always nice to see the under dog come through and that's just what you want to happen for Neil. It will be interesting to see Neil develop as a character in the next books and whether he can incorporate his new found confidence day to day.<br /><br />The bioterror plot line and the bad guys behind the attacks were strong characters although underdeveloped. It left me wondering more about their past. Why did they become terrorists? I also wonder whether the author will incorporate Alice as a secondary character in any of the following books because she is also quite likable.<br /><br />Overall a solid summer read.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|MY SON, 13, LOVES TO PLAY!  I ALSO PLAY OCCASIONALLY, AS A PASS TIME.  I LOVE THE FAST MOVES AND THE SOUNDS!  GOOD QUICK GAME
B000HKW7E0|5.0|If you ever just need to laugh - this is the ticket.  Can't know how many times I've watched it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the recipes I can find as long as lots of misc. ideas, decorating and adorable animal pictures.  Everything is so cool.
0545259096|5.0|I love the characters, the plot,  and the setting. Plus the author wrote the ending to this series in a great way!!
B000WS4PCO|5.0|If you like U2 it is wonderful!!!!  My favorite CD! Listen to it on my commute to and from work.
B000YMQI6E|4.0|Although the ending was predictable, it kept me interested. Great actors! Gosling and Hopkins were great as always. It's a perfect movie for a stay-at-home night!
B008DVJOYG|5.0|I bought this for a gift for my husband.  He is a Springsteen lover and this is one of his favorite CD's. It arrived in a reasonable time and he loves it!!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I love the Disney Classics, and so appreciate that when I receive our family's wish list for the holidays that I can go directly to Amazon to find, purchase and ship directly to the recipient.  This classic film has always been a favorite, and this special edition doesn't disappoint.  I also found that it doesn't matter what format I watch these classics in, the enhancements really don't matter.  The story is the story.  And I love them all.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great writing and never thought I would watch so much PBS--great show and great entertainment.  Really love this series. yea
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Gideon and Eva have so many obstacles in their relationship.  You are always wondering if their love is strong enough- will it withstand all the drama?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|All my friends have been watching and once I started with the first--here I am on the 3rd season--love it
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|Usually I don't think it's fair to the developer to give a low rating to a game because it won't work on the reviewer's device, especially if someone tries to play a Kindle game on a phone. However, I feel justified in giving Kings Can Fly one star when it won't even stay right side up on my Kindle Fire HD 7. Since none of the other reviewers seem to be having this problem, I can only guess that it's some aberration with my device. No matter which way I turn the Kindle, the game flips the other way. Obviously I can't play the game so I don't know if I like it or not.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|First time out for this game, fun but repetitious for us old folks who seem to run the runner into trouble
B008BU75IQ|5.0|It was such fun to rediscover the Clifton Chronicles' characters again.  Each new book in the series increased my interest in the families involved.  I am aleady anxious for the fourth book, but I know it will not be written soon because &#34;Best Kept Secret&#34; was published this year.  I will be disappointed if there is no sequel.
B00004WNTE|4.0|If you already own any Beatles albums, you probably have most of these songs. It's a clean remaster, with a few rarities, but nothing new. If you don't have the albums, I highly recommend it.
B00BJS7104|5.0|love the movie and the convenience of watching it when I get ready and the availability of amazon having such a new film.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After all of the hype I finally broke down and started the series. Yes, it's an easy read and entertaining, but I don't think it's by any means the best book I've ever read.
0817439390|5.0|Great analogies and tips on how to shoot better photos. Really helped me tremendously with my understanding of taking photos.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Very true to the book, it's a great movie. The DVD came in perfect condition and good packaging. Definitely worth buying if you love the book.
B00821OX98|5.0|When the series debuted I had too much going so I let the series pass me by.  Now I'm watching it and so far, only two episodes in, I find it very watchable.  The story has jumped right in, they've touched on some of the things that would probably happen in this scenario - it's believable.  The actors are good, I certainly plan on continuing watching.
B009AMALGM|3.0|I already owned 1-3 so I felt obligated to purchase 4.  It's been done to death now.  They should let it RIP.  Didn't really care for the storyline.  If  you own PA 1-3, you might as well complete the set w/4.  That's the only way you'll find out what happened to the aunt & the baby who were MIA.
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King never disappoints. This is a great summer read and it  was thoroughly entertaining. Written In true King style!
B000W7JWUA|4.0|i would have wanted that the pieces didn't where of carton, but still a really nice game to play. nice Buy
B00ANYJ3NI|4.0|Writen in a conversational style that entertains as well as conveys info that would have otherwise gone over my head. Loved sme of the characterizations.
B009WUBERW|2.0|I love the 80's, but these all you can kill without being killed should be left alone in the 80's or in the Cobra video game..!
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|This CD brought back all the memories of the actual concert I attended in Irvine, CA. They even included the two songs performed by their deceased brother and cousin as a tribute. Nicely done.<br />Our concert had the next generation family members perform and I wish some of those performances could have been on the CD. Now if they would just release a DVD!
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Excellent first read from this author. A bit disturbing , but not surprising given the time and place .  Looking forward the next book of this series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't get enough of this show! and waiting anxiously for next season. Downloading from Amazon was as easy as 1-2-3
1781162646|4.0|Genius idea to print in paperback because it was perfect as a vacation book and easy to read at the beach and the pool.  Nicely written story, a little spooky, but it WAS written by Stephen King!  Great characters ...  As I finished, I passed it on to my husband and my daughter and we all had the same opinion... loved it!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love it especially with my two year old cousin and it is just mind amusing for me when I have nothing to do.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am a newly confirmed Downton Abbey Fan - while I was sad to see some of the characters go - I am intrigued by what can be in store in January when season 4 begins!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I like this and I enjoyed Joss Whedon's touch with it.  If you know his work, you will see his influence.  All the actors did well and the story was pretty coherent.  A good movie to watc with a big bucket of popcorn!
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I enjoy the story line and look forward to the continuation version.  I found it very interesting and fun.  Going back and forward in the program was a little trying until I figured it out.  It kept my attention.
B0062QRTKA|3.0|Semi-interesting format. However,I lost interest pretty quickly. There just wasn't much meat to the game. If you want a distraction, go for it, otherwise, I think there are more interesting time-wasters out there.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|The movie looks as though it had been downloaded illegally. The quality was horrible. Wish I could get a refund.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just got this game and I absolutely love it! It is probably Gameloft's best game! Despicable me 1&amp;2 are my favorite movies so I was sure I would like the game.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|Loved the story and that many of the actors were playing themselves!  Maggie Smith always plays each character with such skill. She is a joy to watch
B00CWY76CC|2.0|great game.  looking for new levels.  cant wait to conquer new rooms. could use a bit more variety in the puzzles but over all fun and addicting game.

B0054LJGWS|3.0|This book has the status of a cult classic, and it deserves it. Although some of the concepts in there are not new (armageddon In a funny view, an old and grumpy but likable man, an angel not so angellical and a demon not so devilish, etc), they are well crafted.<br /><br />The characters feel real, and you can relate to them. And,  as the story unfolds, you will find many funny situations (some are laugh-out-loud funny).<br /><br />I do have some reservations about the some of the final part, though. I guess the authors decided that they should end the book saying something wise, but for the most you get only some superficial moralising stuff.<br /><br />Still, it's an excellent book, and will give some very nice hours of entertainment
B0079R8KXG|5.0|i ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CASE COVER! IT FITS PERFECTLY IN MY PURSE AND BEING AN AVID READER WHO TAKES MY BOOKS EVERYWHERE i WOULD RECOMMEND THIS. iT IS A LITTLE ON THE EXPENSIVE SIDE BUT SO WORTH THE MONEY.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I happened upon Imagine Dragons when I heard a music box remix of their song Radioactive. I hadn't heard of them or their music before then. I tend to pay more attention to bands that are based outside of the United States, but something about the remix grabbed me, so I looked them up on youtube.<br /><br />The lyrics are for lack of a better term, edible. As both a writer and an artist, I love the powerful visualizations and the fantasy quality the their writing has. They use the most bizarre samples too! To me, Tiptoe sounds sparkly :D<br /><br />The songs are personal for Dan Reynolds in particular, and they might not make sense right off the bat. You have to think about them and listen to them a few times to absorb the meaning. I also love every single song, and usually I find at least one song on an album that I need to skip over. I even like Underdog, and I normally don't care for Christian rock songs!<br /><br />Dan's voice is very rich and emotionally moving. There is a lot of live recording on this album. You can tell the drum beats were made with drums, and not a drum machine or recording software. In some places it is obvious they recorded vocals and instruments at the same time, which is hardly ever done nowadays. There is a great deal of skill in being able to record in a studio as a group. They are musicians, not celebrities.<br /><br />Nothing Left to Say is by far the most intense. Definitely the appropriate climax for an album. I can't really describe it, you have to listen to it.
B00BXKKNFS|2.0|I purchased this because no matter what I play it is constantly interrupted. In purchasing thisa I thought it would stop, but it did not. Thank you
B004GWQT5I|4.0|I read the reviews & decided to trust them.  This is a smart, seductive film.  I really thought that this was going to be a very narrow vision, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not always a fan of M Night Shyamalan.  I have to say, I appreciated this film.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I don't like it because you have to purchase items to keep playing.  I'm glad I got it for free.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|We watched seasons one and two in one very long weekend.  Watched it again several months later.  Wonderful.  Not for small childfren.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love how big the calculator is.  I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and it takes up the whole screen.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Outstanding series.  Have now watched all of it twice.  Not for young children.  Acting was terrific and the attention ot historic details was very well done.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love the game but wish it had hints. I never thought that I woiuld down load this game but glad I did.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great fun. Only complaint is the pop up ads after every game. The screen is the smoothest ever.  Would like the option or feature to touch a \\"button\\" and start a new game without having to go to the deck. I'm sure that's on purpose so ads can be forced.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|What a shame the game is so interrupted by intrusive ads that they effect the players score in what could be truly entertaining. The ads are placed in such a way as to become more invasive the further along you get in the game. I contacted the game before writing this reviewing hope they would care enough to correct this of course there was no response. Don't bother getting started.many glitches unable to access parts of the game for days to weeks at a time. Discussion feeds indicate these problems have been longstanding for at least a year. Do not buy gems or coins with real money and use it for gifts as it will disappear without a trace. Unfortunate in what really is a fun game.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It is a fun entertaining game that makes you think. I can't think of any reason not to get it. It is a challenge and it keeps you involved in the game. Have spend a lot of time on it since  I got it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The acting is top notch and the storyline is excellent. Masterpiece Theater does it again! I love shows about this period in time and finding a good one is rare.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I have played magic casually and competitively for years. This app is a great way to learn the game or play with cards you wouldn't normally use. I highly recommend this app.
0679805273|5.0|A classic !!! I  purchase to give to a college graduate.  We all signed it as if it was a year book very special gift.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|used to like this app now not so much preferered the old blue one compared to graphic overload of this update
1781162646|3.0|Don't go into this book expecting a horror story like Carrie or The Shining, because that's not what Joyland is about.  Not that King's written much pure horror in years, which is fine by me because I like his other work much better.<br /><br />Hearts in Atlantis, for example?  I adored it.  Don't go into this book expecting it, either. With that said, there's a lot to like about Joyland.<br /><br />For one, the fact King chose to publish it only as a pulp paperback through a smaller publisher was a really awesome gesture.<br /><br />The carnival setting was also cool, although I was expecting a little more creep factor at first. I think Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury warped my brain for life when I read it in high school.  King presented the carny and its motley cast of characters so well that I fell in love with it almost immediately.<br /><br />I liked the main character, Devin Jones (who prefers to be called Dev), although I couldn't quite connect with him at first.  He was sweet in a 1970's way I'm probably a little too young to understand. Even though I liked him well enough, it took me a while to figure out why I was supposed to care about him as a character.  This is not usually an issue for me with King's protagonists. Fortunately, the supporting characters were strong enough to hold my interest.<br /><br />The story was a nice, easy read, and sucked me in pretty much immediately.  A good bit of it was about the day-to-day life of the carnival and its employees, and the beauty Dev found in it.  When Dev started to get into the swing of life as a carny, I finally got on board with him as a character, because d'aww.<br /><br />There was also a murder mystery subplot involving Linda Gray, whose ghost was said to haunt the carnival.  The characters' efforts to solve the puzzle behind her death were compelling and kept me guessing.<br /><br />Even once I figured out who the perp was, the book kept me engaged with twists and hints that made me doubt my decision, and the question of how Dev was going to solve the case (since he didn't understand the main clue that tipped me off). I enjoyed taking that journey with him, but I had some issues with the way it ended.<br /><br />First, while the story of Linda Gray's murder was handled quite well, the bits about her ghost felt tacked on.  I would have preferred an inconclusive, guess-we'll-never-know sort of resolution over the anticlimactic one that was provided.<br /><br />Secondly, the ending of the book itself felt a little weak to me.  In a scene that should have been emotionally crushing, I found myself wondering what was missing.  I can't put my finger on it, but it didn't punch me in the gut the way I wanted it to.<br /><br />That's more or less my issue with Joyland as a whole.  It kept me going all the way through, but there was some intangible depth I wanted from it that I never quite found.<br /><br />Even so, it's worth picking up, but read Hearts In Atlantis first.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season was very high quality viewing. I did not have any problems while watching. I am very glad this season was provided on Amazon Prime.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is a fantastic product. Simply place the headset into the cradle and it is charges to full capacity in minutes. I am very impressed. This also takes care of 'where did my headset go?' and storage concerns.
0810983915|5.0|My son was so pleased with this couldn't even tel that it was used very pleased with this order I wanna rate this a 100
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A Must read for married or engaged. Highly highly recommend this book for anyone in any family. Wish I'd read it sooner.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is like watching LEAVE IT TO BEAVER!!!! with a British Twist. The acting is marvelous and the storytelling.<br />Jolly Good
1781162646|5.0|This really was a sweet, sweet read. I enjoyed the illustrious characters and how King brought the Carny world to life. The horror creeps up on you slowly but surely. Not to be missed!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's easy it's fun you should get this game I give it five stars get this game before u have to pay for it
B006AX6ONI|5.0|This book allows you to peek at the brain a a very successful business man. Read it carefully and you will learn the real path to success.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing it's very easy but also fun to play its a bit like temple run but better you can unlock boosts and such as a mystery box and the top prize won is 100'000 coins :)<br />Yuri
B00AB7IA1S|4.0|Kings Can Fly is a 'directional' game similar to many railroad games, where you have to direct the traffic from entry to exit.  Why there are multiple balloons, I'm not sure.<br /><br />The developers went to great length to ensure the player is well-tutored, and the overall game is quite attractive.  There aren't any ads, and while I don't like analytics, it is easy enough to get around that by blocking the app with a firewall or other measures.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there seems to be a bug in some of the Kindles where the game is upside down, hence many of the one-star reviews.  I personally think that is unfair; a three-star rating for a bug should be enough in my opinion, and when fixed should be re-reviewed or removed.  We've seen a lot of junk apps that do deserve one-star ratings, and this is NOT in that class of bad app.<br /><br />There are a lot of levels, but not a whole lot of challenge.  It would have been nice to have additional obstacles, goals, and directional tools.  Still, for a buck it's worth it; but if additional content and more difficult levels are included, I think this has a chance at being a five-star game for the 99-cent price point.<br /><br />[As an aside, take a look at this game and Cubimania; both are built on the same engine, but are not the same developer.]
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|I have been a fan of the Die Hard series, and this was just as good as the first,  I like how they have put each member of his familoy into the story.  Is Jack going to pick up where John ends?
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|great.  Not happy with the price on amazon but do like the ease of seeing the shows i want without buying the whole channel system.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Who doesn't remember the story of jack and the beanstalk?  This is a good update to the story.  Saw it in the theatre and enjoyed watching it again.
0143122916|5.0|This story is incredibly revealing. The exposure of concentration camps in North Korea which can be viewed on satellite maps on personal computers is very disturbing. Shin's story is tragic and very educational. His life is a portrayal of human endurance.
B00B2G2RG6|3.0|Good series, interesting topic, good acting.<br />As with most series the story is dragged on.<br />I will watch next season.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Had not seen it before and thought it was entertaining, even for adults. Now I am ready for part 2.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|there will be another one coming out and if there isn't then, I don't like the way this book just ended.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A simply wonderful read with lessons for all. I highly recommend this book! It will brighten your attitude and lift your spirit!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|This game looked fun but there is not enough directions and I could not figure out how to play it.
B002UWH8P6|4.0|I like Sci-Fi and have been a fan of the Stargate series for years. This series took a different path but is still okay.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's addictive!  I can't stop watching.  Really like the dress designs, changing with the times and the furnishings are beautiful.
B0083SBJXS|3.0|I thought this was a decent film, but it was a pretty bland movie. They focused on a small story line and drug it out through the entire movie. Also contained the most mistakes in a film of the summers blockbusters. I am however a minority in not liking this film, so give it a chance.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Nowhere near as good as the Kite Runner.  A disappointment.  I stopped reading it at 50% complete, something I rarely do.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great film! Christopher and Jonathan Nolan do it again! I was worried the film would be just like its predecessor, but it was so different! They are both incredible films and they don't copy each other at all. They are both so original and creative. Hans Zimmer again captures us with his brilliant scores. Definitely one for the collection.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|If you eat food and care about your health: watch this!<br />This was a big eye opener for me. Since I watched this last year (and 2 more times since then), I made changes in the products I buy and I'm still working towards consuming better products and finding ways of removing the middle-man and supporting the local producers.<br />It's hard to walk away from GMO products or brands that abuse animals and farmers, but I'm making progress slowly. I'm buying more local stuff from local farms, which helps them (plus is nice to establish a relationship with the farmer instead of buying veggies from the supermarket where you have minimal human contact).<br />Help yourself, your family, your local farmers and animals, and stop making the big companies even richer at the expense of our health and the lives of humble farmers.
B00C061I3K|3.0|I'm disappointed with Random Access Memories. Not because it lacks anything music-wise; the composition, production, and arrangement on display within the album is masterful. I'm disappointed because Daft Punk promised me a party, but forgot to send me an invitation. The album looks inwards, celebrating the past and itself, leaving me gawking from the outside and longing for a way in. I probably wouldn't be disappointed if it weren't for Homework and Discovery, two albums that brought me along for an incredibly funky ride. RAM is musically sound, but it lacks direction and soul.    The first track that stood out to me is \\"Giorgio By Moroder\\". It's a beautifully crafted track that incorporates Giorgio's monologue over a playful, musical documentary of a song that changes with the story, swelling into a disco-house-orchestral explosion at its climax, then devolving into a modern dance bass line. Yet my experience was slightly diminished after reading the following: \\"The recording engineer later revealed that each microphone was used to represent the different decades contained in Moroder's life monologue and stated that, while most listeners would not be able to distinguish between each microphone, Daft Punk would know the difference.\\" Usually I enjoy little easter eggs like this, but this one just seems kind of random and narcissistic. Like they're making the songs for only themselves. I still really love the track but this will always bother me.    \\"Touch\\" is the focal point of the album. It features Paul Williams lamenting the fact that music sucks nowadays over a behemoth of different sounds, including a meandering trumpet-tuba-clarinet passage, a full-on women's choir, an orchestra for rent, and a pianist who alternates between western saloon and concert hall virtuoso. It's an amazing piece of work to be sure, and it is an extremely effective demonstration of the possible integration between digital (synth, vocoders) and analog (strings, winds, voices). Yet I can't help but feel like the robots are celebrating themselves a) for being able to pull together all these instruments and ideas both skill and money-wise and b) for being different from the garbage on the radio by fusing elements of jazz, funk, and classical music into their electronic music. Yes, I get it, that's why I love you Daft Punk! You don't need to tell me music today sucks, just keep showing me that you're different without being self conscious. Take a page from Giorgio or Daft Punk circa 2001 and bring us the future of electronic funk.    I guess that's not the point of this album. Much like this review, RAM is a critique of the modern state of music combined with a longing/reverence for the past. Yet it just doesn't move me. In the song \\"Within,\\" the robots fail to connect on a deeper level: \\"There are so many things that I don't understand/ There's a world within me that I cannot explain\\" - come on man. \\"Digital Love,\\" \\"Something About Us,\\" \\"Face to Face,\\" and \\"Too Long,\\" weren't exactly shakespearean epics, but these lyrics are just bland and uninspired. \\"Game of Love\\" isn't much better -\\"There is a game of love/ This is a game of love/ And it was you...the one that would be breaking my heart/ When you decided to walk away.\\" Sometimes a singer's voice can convey the emotion much better than the words she sings; unfortunately for us, we get a vocoded robot trying to stir emotions with these pithy lines.    \\"Instant Crush\\" and \\"Doin' it Right\\" could be my favorite tracks on the album along with \\"Giorgio By Moroder\\". Julian Casablancas of the Strokes does a great job of communicating even through his vocoder, and Panda Bear adds a much needed element of human to the end of the album. Pharrell Williams tries to sing with the soul and emotion of 70′s and 80′s soul over groovy if not repetitive Nile Rogers licks, but it's missing energy and feeling and comes off thin and strained. Good music is supposed to move you, physically and/or emotionally, and RAMfails this test on many occasions. It's not something I would groove to at parties, and it's not something I would connect with alone.    Another small gripe is the lack of flow. Almost every song on the album is a self-containing story. The transition from one sweeping epic to the next is minimal. Each song is a complete thought within itself. This makes for a grating, tiring experience. Like reading these sentences. It's hard to understand how the thoughts are connected. Not every song on the album has to be a masterpiece, damnit! There can be no mountains without valleys, and I'm not sure which tracks are which in Random Access Memories.    To sum it up: \\"Daft Punk felt that while current technology allows for an unlimited capacity to store recorded material, the content produced by contemporary artists has diminished in quality. Their goal was therefore to maximize the potential of infinite storage by recording a sprawling amount of elements. The duo pointed to the process as being further inspiration for the album's title, as they sought to make connections out of the random series of ideas.\\" You don't make a well-crafted story out of a series of random ideas and elements. You can polish every little gem as much as you want, but you can't just glue them all together and call it a chandelier. Daft Punk has arranged each jewel in a big, beautiful case for people to admire, but they will go untouched and, ultimately, forgotten.    [...]
B0064MPXFA|5.0|one of those shows you just can't get enough of, watch 2 or 3 episodes a day. Glad there's more seasons
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I did not have high hopes for this hero because this was not my favorite character in the previous novels, but this was fantastic.<br /><br />While you could read alone, I really would suggest the entire series from the beginning.  This is a superb fantasy romance series and as a reader you will maximize impact if read in the correct sequence.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|good movie, didn't want to pay to see in theaters but enjoyed it at the house. Was better than I thought it would be CGI is very good.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|for the sounds, for me anyway.  This is not my favorite background music and match sounds.  That's why I gave it 3 stars because otherwise, Mahjong is Mahjong and I generally like the game.
B005WQ4RP6|5.0|I enjoyed the suspense, like a Hitchcock Movie. Parts of it were a little too violent for me, but I would watch it again. De Niro does an excellent job as portraying a vindictive, crazy lunatic, bent on revenge. I don't know what it is rated, but I would say 18 and over, not PG 13.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|I like it, have not taken the the time to learn how to use it.  Looks pretty cool and the color is good.
B0089LOG02|3.0|Reading the book encouraged me to learn more about a subject I knew nothing about. Some great info on the net including interviews with some of the orphan train kids.
1432794426|5.0|Now this is my favorite book in my collection!!!<br />As a long-time, ardent admirer of Michael Jackson, I am happy that there is finally a caring, truthful book about him. I live in Hungary and Michael Jackson is very popular here. I hope to help advance his legacy in the same positive direction as Dr. Moriarty has done as the author of this book.<br />I hope someday we can meet in person with the author... :)
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I feel in love with movie and this version is great because I can watch on my ipad, regular dvd player, blue ray player. Pretty much any way you would want to watch this movie. Amazon has the best price for the new version ... trust me I checked around I like to hunt for bargans.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Game is great to play. Good buy. Better then subway surfer. I will say get it while it is free.<br />Get it now.<br /><br />.
0553106635|4.0|I was happy with the purchase. The dust jacket was a bit beaten around the edges, but that was to be expected. Shipping was timely and the book seems to be in fine, new, condition. Not mint, but clearly never read. If you have made it to book 3 you probably enjoy the series already so commenting on the plot or characters would do little to assist you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Better than temple run! I think everyone should! get there is a boss battle, different<br />Locations, different minions and much more. :^)

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is an awesome game it is really fun but I wish I could get MC3 and MC2 but this game is awesome especially on multiplayer it is definitely my favorite game on my kindle it is totally AWESOME
B008YRVW0I|2.0|I hardly got started playing when up pops this message for me to buy additional tanks and it will not let me continue with the tank that I was working on.  Nothing was said that this was part of the conditions to purchasing this game.  I am very disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun, you train them compete. I wish I could do this in real life, the horse you get will guarantee be the nicest living being you'll ever meet.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved the game, look forward to more challenges.  Makes you think but don't think too much, sometimes it's ride under your nose.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I'm an aspiring semi professional photographer who was looking for &#34;the next level&#34; of techniques to help me grow.  This book met that desire and so much more! I'll read through it again and again just to keep up my inspiration.  This book should be on your must read list especially if you are just getting started in photography.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really fun. Interesting. And for me has a point where i need to think. If you are lime me, a person who likes to build and design things, than you will like this game.
B000MR1V22|5.0|Incredibly funny, and deeply touching without being sappy. The casting is perfect, and the message truly hits home. I could watch this movie every week, and never tire of it!
B00B22IJXK|4.0|I enjoyed this app alot. Especially since you have a wide variety of features included. My favorite feature was the different picture schemes that you can choose or combine. The one thing i didn't like is the fact that you can't go back on a mistake you made to fix it after you already applied it. Other than that i really liked this app.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are great. The horses are gorgeous and realistic. The game is just so slow, so I took a star of for lack of excitement. I did just start, though, so maybe it gets better.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Keeps me informed,like the details that are given love the video feeds very good graphics like the way they are shown.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|WONDERFUL LOVED THE BOOK CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE 4TH BOOK IS OUT I'VE READ THE CROSSFIRE TRILOGY FIVE TIMES. CAN'T GET ENOUGH SYLVIA DAY YOU ROCK.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is a SEXY SERIOUS book! I love it so much!That I would marry it!It really helps people read!
1451695195|5.0|This was an excellent book! Very inspiring. I'm glad Mr. Alexander chose to share this wonderful miracle with the world.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was very good. It took  me a while but I did it. The challenge was great. I can't wait for the next level to see how it goes. When will the next levels be ready. I can't wait to challenge my mind some more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is crazy addictive. I play it at midnight until my sister tells me to &quot;Stop Kindle-ing&quot;<br />But seriously, I reccomend this. Plus when I lay on my side, Jake or whoever I am playing as, doesn't tip to the left/right.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love this app and it is very fun but it is basically a version of Dragonvale with worse graphics in my opinion although you can only download Dragonvale with Apple products!
B0055PMJMW|5.0|The three stories were great,  but short as you would expect in a short story!<br />Love all his novels, especially Harry<br />Bosch!
0143034901|5.0|I saw this book at my public library and after hearing some rumblings about it thought I would give it a shot. I was completely enthralled with the story, the characters, and the intricacies of the plot. I completely captured by the author's portrayal of Barcelona, fascist Spain, and the Carax story line. This is truly one of the best novels I have read in a long time, and would highly recommend this book. For me it was a story that completely engrossed me, I spent a few long evenings wandering through the \\"Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\" and navigating the streets of post-war Barcelona.  It was time well spent with a great storyteller, and his wonderful characters.
B00280LYHS|2.0|I like how there is so much action in the book but I hated how there were so many deaths like Bekendorfs and Luke's otherwise it was an awesome book series. :) I <3 Percy Jackson<br />(Or as Mr. D would call him, Peter Johnson.) :D
B0018RWD6S|5.0|I read an article a few years back, which made a case for this as the best album ever.  While it was interesting, I kind of brushed it off as just hyperbole from an old time jazz critic. However, as time goes on I find myself listening to this \\"record\\" probably more often than any other in my Jazz collection. For me when I play this it is like being in a trance for the full length of the set.  Coltrane's \\"voice\\" has always been like a siren's call to my ear, as for Hartman I have always felt this by far was his finest hour. Hartman's smoky baritone is completely lifted to a higher level, as it is interwoven with Trane's beautiful tenor play.  The interplay between the two principals is taken to an even higher level by the superb trio playing behind them. The Tyner, Garrison, and Jones version of the Coltrane Quartet was responsible for most of my favorite Trane sessions, a tighter quartet in that era would be hard to find.  If you couple all that with a perfect selection of songs, impeccable arrangements, and awesome interpretations, and you have the \\"perfect recording\\".  I would select \\"Lush Life\\" and \\"Dedicated to You\\" as my favorite tracks but the difference is marginal as all six tracks are outstanding and leave the listener with their own signatures. Finally I read somewhere that tapes of the session have been found and contain alternate takes of all 6 songs, however due to ownership disputes have never been released. Let's hope that can be resolved soon, I would love to \\"get a listen\\" to those takes. All that said maybe, just maybe this is the greatest recording ever............ wherever it ranks it's pretty darn good.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse is an extremely fun game in my opinion. I love the competitions but I think there could be some more mini games like hoof cleaning or something like thar otherwise best game ive ever played.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|Am really enjoying this CD.  Rhianna has what I think is an interesting and great voice that doesn't SCREAM to get the job done.  She has a wide range of stylizing her music.  My fave cut on this CD is Stay. I've watched the video (there are two of them on YouTube), as well.  This is my first CD by Rhianna, though I've enjoyed her music for awhile. I would say this might be considered a good first Rhianna CD if you have none yet. Enjoy!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great way to keep up with my Facebook when I'm away from home. My Kindle Fire gives me quick and easy access so I don't miss a thing!
0375869026|5.0|I read Wonder for ReadALoud in a fifth grade class. It is a great choice for reading aloud. You have to be able to read the &#34;fart&#34; story with a straight face. This part of the story really seems to engage the boys! Also, it's tough not to cry toward the end. The story builds empathy for others is a non preachy form and gives the reader a chance to reflect on the message &#34;choose kind&#34; for ourselves. I highly recommend Wonder.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Love the app .. the kindle fire is where I play this .. normally at night when i'm doing a bit of unwind
B000000OU0|5.0|if you don't already own this CD you must be the last person on earth to hear the reunion tour.
0316227706|5.0|This book will make you laugh out loud.  I bought several copies as gifts for dog lovers.  A great price on Amazon, definitely worth it.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I purchased this cable for my older Kindle. Reasonably priced and works well.<br />Received it via US mail very quickly!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love minion rush so much  that i will die trying to play it and if i am at heaven i will keep on playing it like forever
B00AB7IA1S|1.0|This is stupid all it did was when I held it to we're it was right side up it would flip upside Down do not recommend
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun for awhile. then I just get bored after awhile. still like the game.I would stay this game is better for kids.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really like the series, just hate when some of the characters are killed off. Will recommend to other Zombie fanatics.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I upgraded to the Pro version. It is very accurate and has has some useful features. It announces when your battery is getting low. When charging, it announces when fully charged. This is a great feature for the Fire HD that (inexplicably) has no charge charge indicator light.
B0095GXUDY|5.0|This won't be my most lengthy review ever, but I just want to briefly tell about the book (without giving the ending away) and then just say if I liked it or not.<br /><br />A reporter hears about this kid that survived a shipwreck, and he wants the whole story. So he finds him, and the kid (who is now a forty or fifty year old man) starts to tell the whole story!<br /><br />The first part of the story is when Pi was a young boy, he lives with this family in India, they own a zoo and he knows a lot about animals. He experiments with Christianity and Islam, in spite of his native Hindu religion.<br /><br />Second part of the book is when the boy is a teenager, and is forced by his family to move to Canada and take what animals they did not sell with them. He gets stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger, and he comes to see the tiger as a friend/enemy. The Tiger of course is just a tiger, he's not a supernatural being, he's not a God, he is simply trying to survive this whole ordeal too!<br /><br />The boy and the tiger have many wacky, if not love/hate adventures together, from hunting for fish, to being on an algae island with a species of aquatic meerkats.<br /><br />Read the book first before watching the movie, it will fill in the gaps of what is in the movie.  This is a good book for anyone that loves animals and religion!
1580086810|1.0|I wasted my money on this book. I did not need it at all, and I would not recommend it to anybody.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|For anyone who has seen the original \\"Frankenweenie\\" this one just happens to be an updated version, its 87 minutes long (compared to the original which was 28 minutes).<br /><br />From the same director (Tim Burton), except he wanted to make this animated version longer than the original (which was with real people), but it's still in black and white.  He wanted to add more character development in this one, and he wanted to add more characters to make it into an action packed plot!<br /><br />It's basically the same as last time, Sparky gets run over by a car and is killed, and Victor brings him back to life!<br /><br />However, it doesn't stop with the dog running around and freaking the whole town out which ends up with the town turning into a lynch mob with pitch forks.  It continues with another part of the plot...the science fair!<br /><br />The adults freak out about the substitute science teacher from Eastern Europe (I guess that's where he's from) and word gets out among the kids that Victor brings Sparky brought to life.  The jealous classmates then decide to make better experiments that Victor used to bring Sparky back to life on either their dead pets or just some random dead animals they found lying around.<br /><br />Sadly there is one thing that is missing in their experiments, heart and almost soul!  In some symbolic way (I'm just guessing here) it thickens the plot when the classmates get reckless with their experiments!<br /><br />That's all I have to tell, just watch it and you will be amazed and even lighthearted!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love it  the timer works fine with my kindle and phone The update added more sounds. So  I  definitely would recommend this app to people with children it helps then fall asleep!!!!!!
0316247545|5.0|This is definitely one of the more prized books in my possession. I'vent read too far yet, but from what I've seen so far, it's really slick. The references are great, and the original concept sketches from Lauren Faust are really cool.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I got this game because my friend had it and I liked it. Recently I noticed that the game is going downhill. I had 4 gems, then I got rid of some parasprites and I only had one gem left. It happened also when I closed out of the game and came back with less gems than I had the day before. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think it would be cool if you could be able to pay for a pony that costs a ton of gems (Rainbow Dash etc.) With  A mix of gems and coin bits or with some element of harmony. That would make life easier.<br />Add me: Iamyasaman
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I do not like the updated app.  The old version was easy to navigate and view.  My husbands Fire HD upgraded before mine (Fire) and he didnt like it.  He uninstalled it on his.  My Weather Channel updated and I was so bummed out.  it is uninstalled on my fire also.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|I had seen the movie several years, but my granddaughter wants to watch the new Red 2 movie, but had never seen the first one, so we downloaded for her.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun it's addicting I think it's better then all the temple run games it's fun in Paris and Rome!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|This was the second time that I watched this movie.<br /><br />I still wish that Amazon would put the year that the movie came out in the movie's description somewhere.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Lots of action in this movie from the start. The characters were true to the series.<br />New and old fans will enjoy it.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|It is nice to be able to have an app that allows you to have a stack of different note taking book area for different subjects. A student could take class notes with this app.  Hats off to the creator.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|It gives you an idea on how quickly a virus can spread around the world and how potentially deadly virus can be.<br />Stay safe.
B000HZGBLA|5.0|If you haven't seen Tomb Raider, you have missed out in life.  I love the bond that is supported through the entire action packed movie of Lara and her dead father.  This movie is a MUST to see over and over.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|More difficult to the normal temple run which is great. My 3 year old also enjoys the new temple run.
0345803485|1.0|This has to be hands-down the absolute worst book ever written in the history of books. DO NOT PURCHASE IT! STOP THE MADNESS! Because people like me have idiot moments where we feel we need to check into this book, this author is making MILLIONS off us poor saps. The characters are awful, the writing is beyond atrocious. I mean come on people - out of 20,000 reviews on Amazon, over 25% of them are 1 star. We should know better than to buy this book! And now they are making it into a movie - and people will pay to see it!<br /><br />I am starting a movement, which will hopefully soon be a revolution. Write the publisher Random House and demand your money back. Let them know that you will not stand for this type of awful writing (which shamelessly promotes violence against women as an acceptable form of behavior) ever again!<br /><br />You can find the publisher's address on their website or on my Facebook page. Come like my Facebook page, Fifty Shades of Crap, and share your reviews there as well. Let's send a clear message to any other author or publisher that thinks they can get away with this type of scam in the future that it will not be tolerated!
1616550414|5.0|A book like this for Zelda is more than a few years overdue.  It's comprehensive, revealing, informative and we finally--FINALLY--got our timeline(s).  I could have done with a little less focus on Skyward Sword, but that's to be expected, and not enough to make me downvote it from 5 stars.  If you're a Zelda fan, you need this.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|After a sub-par, near boring season 3 ... they pick up where they left off with season 2.  It quickly becomes a MUST-WATCH-NEXT-EPISODE situation.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I loved this murder mystery.  I look forward to more Maggie mysteries in the future.  Sure keeps stories alive and exciting.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|This game is fun. I only gave it three stars because you only have 6 games a week to play and you have to use your facebook account to even play this game. I don't like having to use other social media to be a part of a game,
0517548232|5.0|This book is the bomb. It's great, awesomely written, and easy for beginners or experienced alike. Get it if you're into econ
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked the levels and the different ways you had to figure out how to open the door. I gave it 4 stars because I felt that the game could have been longer with more levels.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really love this app! I'm so happy my sister introduced it to me, with my fiance working a night schedule it really helps the night fly by! I pin on 2 different devices simultaneously.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is very short but it is awesome! Dav is so cute!<br /><br />Graphics +<br /><br />Story=<br /><br />Game play +<br /><br />Total game time (too beat all of the bosses(2))1 hour -<br /><br />Rating 87%<br /><br />- bad  +good.  = okay
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|From the first page I have enjoyed this book very much.<br />I haven't finished it yet but look forward to the next time I read it.<br />The story writing is really top class.
B007RTUPTS|3.0|It is mostly old American folk songs. Recording was good and vinyl is top quality. A side of NY that I haven't heard before.
0061733199|3.0|The book gives information needed to use in survival skills. If you are looking for an exciting read, this is not the book. Boring, but informative.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Lots of excitment. Sure didn't get sleepy watching all the chase scenes and bloody falls and injuries for both father and son. Just wondered what happened to the Mom!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A good game that is not too difficult. Quite a range of different challenges. Good for a longish train journey!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show I just hope they can continue to keep it interesting. Also hope they stop killing off some of the main charectors.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Now reading the 3rd book of the trilogy and am finding it a fascinating subject with real connotations. Science fiction at its finest and told with skill.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This continues to be a wonderful show.<br /><br />** spoiled alert!**<br /><br />I was sorry to see a few of my favorites depart but it does help further the development of the characters and help keeps the plot moving forward.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I couldn't seem to put this book down, although it is quite gruesome in parts still an overall excellent read.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|ru<br /><br />I love this game I wish there were more like it. I'm uninstalling just to start over. please do some more games like this
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is nice to play right before bed; it's a good way to end the day quietly and sluff off other thoughts of the day with something fun and a little challenging. I feel like it sometimes relies too heavily  on colors to get to the next level, but it's generally a good level of difficulty; it's a challenge, but not too difficult, and I always feel &#34;rewarded&#34; when I find the next clue or go to the next level. Can't wait for more levels!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This one is great... I need more... kept me on edge... loved it! If there is going to be another book, I am not sure if I'll be able to wait for it without losing it :)
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I waited so long for this book to come out and even though I enjoyed it, the ending was really disappointing. With the constant delay in releasing this book I expected more. On top of that, at the end of the book it doesn't even tell you when another book is coming out to complete the story so you are left in suspense.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is long but it is so entertaining it goes by fast. It's great and throws a lot of unexpected punches.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|wow I thought it would be really dumb but I just spent like 10 mind on it best game. good for everyone.<br />my brow loves BEST
B004XQO8VO|5.0|Demolition Man (1993)<br />Directed by Marco Brambilla (the great director of the Alicia Silverstone classic kidnapping rom-com Excess Baggage)<br />Starring Sylvester Stallone (John Spartan), Wesley Snipes (Simon Phoenix) and Sandra Bullock (Lenina Huxley)<br /><br />Before there was SPEED 2, and ALL ABOUT STEVE Sandra Bullock perfected her ability to portray a character conflicted with autism first in the movie Demolition Man.  In it she is the stuttering eqivilent of a female Hugh Grant, and with all the sexual charisma.  Although Sandra is great, what makes this movie classic is the homoerotic love story between Stallone and Snipes, the dystopic Taco Bell future, and the mystery of the three seashells.<br /><br />Stallone and Snipes are arch nemesis (is it nemeseeeeees?).  Snipes is frozen.  In the future, which in this case is 1997, we will freeze our criminals.  Great idea by the way.  Stallone doesn't trust this system.  Therefore, he is frozen too.  Therefore, the two main characters are frozen for centuries.  Wow.  Exciting.  Then, not to spoil it, Snipes is defrosted, and Stallone wakes up and goes on a quest to wipe his ass.  Seriously, a lot of time is spent on his wiping his ass with three seashells(?).<br /><br />Interesting enough the film predicts a world where only Taco Bell exists.  Interesting to see that Taco Bell will survive its beef flavored grissle scandal.<br /><br />I love this movie, and finally figured out how to use the seashells...  Want to shake my hand?
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a very good game and you couldn't possibly make it better. This is the end of my review.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Movie has a good deal of character development for a 2 hour movie.  Characters are believable (though actor ages don't fit the high school theme), and the last 30-45 minutes is good action as well.  There are scenes which are ridiculously unbelievable, but given the subject matter, that's almost a given.  I loved it, and even my wife found it entertaining.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Even if you have been watching the series reading the stories is a wonderful endeavor. I finally figured out how all the characters relate to one another
B00B81B0HC|5.0|I have listen to Night Visions (Deluxe) 3 times and I am so glad I purchased the deluxe version. Great value and one of my favorite songs is included in the bonus section. I have noticed what some other's have commented on with the sound. I have found that if you change you player to handle enhance bass, it makes a huge difference.<br />I grew up in the 80's, so I love their sound. I definitely recommend the deluxe version, especially if it is still on sale for 5.99.
B004GYY714|5.0|I was searching for my favorite independent radio station on my Kindle and Voila! there it was!  Great job, TuneIn Radio!
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Excellent story, great car, and an awesome but moving ending. I love the end, when the entitled granddaughter thinks she's getting the car and she doesn't.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|great series, even better than the show.  more detailed than show.  i picked up on things in the book i didn't in the tv show.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show, it does keep you wanting more despite some of it being boring and drawn out at times. Can not wait for next season.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|Lot's of action that kept it interesting. A great story line.  I wish these books were all made into movies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a great interpretation of the feelings that movies don't show. Wish I wouldn't have watched the movie first.  Great book!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved it all! Read the first book to. Understand this book. I love this series already. I love Ethan wate
B003UY0ZFS|5.0|I first heard this while sitting at a cafe overlooking the Adriatic Sea. Really cool stuff and puts one in a good mood!
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Can't go wrong with Simon Peg and a cast like this one! Great writing as usual. This a great gift for my nephew.
B00BWRKVVS|5.0|Great movie x'2. We are big Disney movie people and this was a great addition to our collection. A must for a Disney collector.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is hands down one of my new favorite shows!!!! I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a whitty show!
B000005ALP|3.0|This was my first full album experience with Eels and, while some of the songs were enjoyable, overall, it just wasn't for me.  Some of the songs were a little repetitive for my taste and it just didn't quite float my boat.  I do have to give credit, however, to some well crafted lyrics and the chill, laid-back mood of the music.  It is all well-constructed, but I think I just wasn't a big fan of the &#34;no-one-understands-me-so-I'm-going-to-write-12-songs-about-it&#34; theme of the album.  But that's just personal taste.  If you're a fan of laid-back, creatively written songs that are, in some ways, off the beaten path, then I would give this album a listen.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I hate that they wait 11 MONTHS before coming out with the next season. it's just not fair. great series
B004S9AK3G|4.0|Like pillars of the earth this is another character rich story of love, betrayal, ambition and survival. Found it a wonderful read and highly recommend. Although there are some similarities to 'pillars of the earth' Ken Folett is still my favourite author
1934429821|4.0|The book is amazing, though there was slight damage to the spine on the bottom of the book. Past that, terrific.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Funniest game ever. The picture did not look fun so I downloaded it and it was awesome. Funniest game ever. (Awesome by the way)
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is one of the best series ever, and with Amazon Prime I get to watch all five seasons in HD for free. That's Amazon and that's why their amazing!
B0050R0XEG|5.0|It's a great buy and build for the price. The details of the van looks just like what it would on the actual van.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think this book is AMAZING!!! And that she should make another book series like this, and my favorite character is Peeta because he is strong and brave.
0312427999|4.0|I like this book and I will read and reread it.  I will even allow others to read it; that's how informative I thought it was.  And it was in some ways a &#34;Shock Doctrine&#34; too.
0634022296|5.0|If you're a Beatlemaniac who loves jamming out to your favourite songs, this one is for you.<br />It is amazing.<br />Every song is in there with very chord written accurately.<br />Fab!
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I wish I had a Gideon Cross for everyday of my life,  one can only wish and hope for some hot and erotic sexual partner to spend the rest of my days with .Got to love it Give me more Sylvia........
B0091REZMW|4.0|Sometimes too easy, but good to pass the time. Not really a plot or storyline, but overall a fun game.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very helpful to let me know when I need to charge my device before it gets to low on charge. Plus its free, free. Doesn't get no better than free.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Loved the sequel to City of Bones. Clare keeps the reader totally engaged until the very end with twists and turns that keep you wanting more!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Fun good happy money free fun great cool awesome job and the lesser banishing words from title or description can your own company is looking for someone who has been in the lesser extent that they as
B004HWYTP4|3.0|I expected better acting from these professionals. They seemed to be simply reciting their lines with minimal effort to really act the parts.
B00065MDRW|5.0|This album holds up very well after all these decades. Lots of interesting textures. Excellent songwriting and performances. A must listen for any prog fans.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is a well written book, about one third of the way through I was having a hard time putting it down. It keeps you guessing about so many different things at once. Read. Enjoy. Reflect.
0140544518|5.0|While they like the story, and think it is funny, my kids ages 5 and 4 don't fully &#34;get&#34; the irony in spite of the fact that they are familiar with the 3 little pigs.
B005JE7XW0|5.0|The best horromedy ever made!  I rarely see a movie that I can stand watching more than once.  I saw this one 3 times with my kids and laughed to tears every single time.  Acting is superb from both Dale and Tucker and the whole thing is hilarious. The expression &#34;these stupid college kids&#34; has now permanently entered my lexicon.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|I was so sorry I rented it.  I turned it off.  It was just a mess and I could not stand it one more minute.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a fun show that the whole family can watch, can hardly wait for season 3 to come out.
0307476073|5.0|It was hard to put it down and even when I had no choice, I could still feel in my body what Strayed endured.  She lost a lot, including an unborn child by choice. Her pilgrimage through Nature carrying her \\"monster&#34 backpack gave her the compass we all need in life to find peace and with it the best way to go on.
1416914293|5.0|I loved it, great book, just make you want to read more. Really fun, and modern, now I want to read the next book.
0545091020|5.0|same review as book 2 - it is used to listen to during a driving trip - last year from St Louis to California and back
B0084AZXKK|4.0|This is a great adventure story that can be enjoyed by adults and younger readers alike.  This is a &#34;must read&#34; book!
0545101417|5.0|I bought it for a driving trip with book 1 and 3 and I was pleased. I will listen again on future trips
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|It was fun to watch just for the adult twist on the fairy tale. The visual effects helped a lot. Very entertaining.
0545101425|5.0|same review as book 2 - it is used to listen to during a driving trip - last year from St Louis to California and back
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is excellent! I enjoyed every minute of it! Too bad it's such a short game. Hopefully there's a sequel coming soon
B00621ENT0|5.0|What a way to wrap up the season.  Not all ends were tied in a neat little bow, which is always nice.  But I even got a little emotional with the last episode.  As with all the seasons, once I started, I wanted to keep watching until I finished the entire season.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|What  I can say - it's a fun thinking game, there are a lot of different shapes to play.  I enjoy it.
B00BESM14U|5.0|A Great, fun high school yet deep movie. The actors were perfect for their roles. Recommend this one for sure.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|May be a little biased, as John Adams is my &#34;favorite&#34; President.  This mini series was done incredibly well & works perfectly from the book.  A must own for the family & history of our great nation.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Love the transformation of Gru.  Very touching.  I think we could still get away from the excessive violence between Gru and Vector in particular, but other than that, it's a great movie for families and other fun loving individuals.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I started reading this after watching the pilot of the tv show.<br />Dialogue driven, well crafted story.<br />Looking forward to the next one.
1451695195|3.0|The fact that a neurosurgeon is able to scientifically eliminate possible reasons for his NDE is worth noting.  I was disappointed that he did not address how, if at all, his NDE affected his day-to-day experiences.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Love it!  The characters are full and rich and the story lines pull you in and make you want more.  If you like any kind of super natural type shows,  you will love this.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I was looking for something different to read and stumbled on this series.  The story was believable and interesting and keep me turning pages to find out what was going to happen.  I have already started on the 2nd book.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Reno, Oldman and Portman and fantastic performances, guaranteed entertainment. Optimum film!!! Chilling performances ... tense film from beginning to end ... Great!!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|A fun and easy game to play with gorgeous graphics and an intuitive and easy to use control sequence. Ive only played a few hours but i already love it. I gave it 4 stars strictly because when you upgrade your weapons you have to wait a couple of hours before you can use them since they are &quot;being crafted by the weaponsmith&quot; and im not good at being patient for an upgrade ive paid for. Other than that love it!
B00594XOZU|3.0|As long as your other friends have kik messenger, it is a great app to have on your device. But, if your friends don't have it, then it becomes an issue.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As always Michael Connelly has done and exceptional job of bringing his characters to life I love Harry Bosch I would recommend this book to any one who likes fast pace mysteries with police procedure mixed in
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great book. Couldn't put it down. Read all three. Is there going to be a second movie?<br />Will read more of your books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Its a good mind challenging game that has you struggling to complete the current level. Some levels are easier than the previous level and others are harder than the one before.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I love having Free Facebook on my Kindle, it keeps me up on what is going on with my FB friends. I still answer and write comments on my computer, but can check on things with my Kindle. I think anyone with love Full Facebook Free.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was unable to find any redeemable qualities in these charcters. Brilliant writing regardless.I look forward to a screenplay.I hope they make good casting choices.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game constantly. It's easy to learn and fun to play. Passes the time , sometimes I forget to put it down.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I have read both day one and day two of this series. This is one of those books which are hard to put down once I start. Rothfuss started out a little choppy on book one with switching tenses and the flow of the story, but by book two had improved immensely. I am a huge fan of sci-fi/fantasy, and generally find it difficult to discover authors who are imaginative and basically well-written. I find myself hoping book three will be out soon.
0425263924|1.0|I could not believe how this book ended after reading the previous two.  They left me anticipating the next book in the series until now.  I feel the author cared more about trying to ensure future earnings than actually producing a story of quality and character.  Although I like the characters the story line has become bitterly stale.  Nothing worse than being lured in only to find the true reason was only to tie you to the next edition.  Ms. Day doesn't even try to hide the fact, how crass.
B0076XIS4O|5.0|Hands down, one of the most interesting and innovative albums in a long time. The vocals are like and airy, but the music is still strong and solid. LOVE this album. Beginning to end
B009MYAQK4|5.0|Paulo Coelho has long been one of my favorite authors. Manuscript Found in Accra, while different than I expected, is a wonderful read, full of wisdom!
B005G6QF8Y|3.0|I got this album as it was recommended by a friend who usually has decent taste. Thile it is not &#34;bad&#34;, it wasn't overwhelmingly good either. A tad bland and forgettable. I'll admit though, I have only listened to the whole thing about 3 times. I was soon bored with it, so now it's kind of just dead space on my harddrive.<br /><br />I do want to give this another shot though. Sometimes, I'm too quick to judge.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Clint Eastwood continues to show that he is at the peak of his storytelling powers!<br />All aspects of the film- directing, acting, music, cinematography does its part!!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I seldom read movie reviews.  I never see eye to eye with the critics.  The cast is superb that is why I got the movie.  It did NOT disappoint.  I laughed so hard.  The interaction was fantastic.  The only problem is when Morgan Freedman died.<br />Get it - it is great
B007PJFIU6|4.0|even the 4 and 6 year old had fun playing it with us...could also be played with adults only, using harder clues of course . So it is a fun game for everyone.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|Fascinating history and insight into Steve Wozniak's life and passions! Profoundly interesting and pleasant to read. Very inspiring. Recommended reading for anyone who's fascinated by electronics, programming, and would like to learn about the birth of the home computer industry.
B007MDB71O|5.0|i really dug this movie. I think its a good flick for the whole fam to enjoy. in short this movie is BALLER!
B000FBJF6Y|1.0|The sound is not consistent and fades in and out.  I'll never purchase anything with WhisperNet until it is upgraded to Audiobooks quality.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Kept me entertained on a rainy day. Even had my hubby helping!<br />Fun and challenging to find clues and solve the puzzles.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Now I see what I missed when I didn't watch this series in the 1970's. Excellent characters and plots make this a timeless series.
0345529057|5.0|Like many others I came to read GOT after watching the show and im so glad I did.  I had so many questions that have been answered now that im reading the books and instead of taking away from my viewing experience, I think reading the books has added dimension for me.  Im hooked!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I stumbled upon this book in a weird way, but long story short this book was something I needed and it was at a critical point of timing in my life/career.  I really enjoyed Jame's insights on the future of business/employment and while it can seem terrifying I think it is very realistic.  Really good read that is also very entertaining with tons of good stories.  As someone who hardly ever reads, books like this want me to do it a lot more!
B00124BNF4|5.0|If you don't know the Talking Heads very well, but want to get into them this album is a great starting point.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|While I enjoyed the season, I felt like the show was just going through the motions and seemed a bit forced.  I can't put my finger on what exactly bothered me about the season, but there was just something missing.  I felt like there was less passion from the characters this season as opposed to the first 2 seasons as well.
B003YOASY2|5.0|This is the album that changed everything. If you don't have it already it is a must to add to your music collection.
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|I love this film and everything in it. The story, the cinematography, the music, the transfer by Criterion Collection, Michel Douglas Performance.. David Fincher made a solid Thriller, very atmospheric. But still more, I love Deborah Kara Unger. Since I saw her in \\"Crash\\", David Cronenberg's movie, I felt in love with her...<br />I recomend this Blu-ray...
B00CRW2066|5.0|This album will probably make you want to jump off the top of a building, but that's what The National is good for. It may be depressing at times, but it's great music.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Much better than I thought. Almost zero chance to get bored while watching the whole series. Started season 2, which is a little disappointing than the 1st one.
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|I know they're getting really old, but that doesn't mean they can't keep making great music. A must have album for any Bad Religion fan.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The 2 men outlined in A HIGHER CALL are true heroes. This book is well written and well worth buying. History buffs as well as those seeking a positive story about impossible circumstances will appreciate it.
0345529057|5.0|Holy crap these books are awesome. There really isn't much more to say about it. You'll want to read them over and over again.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It seems I am not alone in my dislike for the new and unexpected update.  My once loved and easy to use goto weather app is now a pretty, overworked, inconvenient annoyance.  I dont need cute graphics, reward points, and definitely dont need large ads that take over the page.  Honestly it feels as though the weather is an added extra, rather than what the app is actually for.  Sadly I am going to uninstall :(
B001B1CBSQ|4.0|While this is considered by many a classic hip hop album, I have to say that while it has some REALLY GREAT songs it also has some songs that I find myself skipping through. Regardless, it's worth it for the great songs.
B000QCTNIW|5.0|I read this book for continuiing education credits.  A fellow mental healthcare professional had suggested that I read it last year, but was too busy at the time and thought I would get to it later.  Well, later was just fine, since I had a chance to read it slowly and do some research on my own along with the reading.  It was wonderful and I have recommended it to several people since I finished.
B0013DC5B0|4.0|This album is just silly. It's not their greatest, but it's good for the occasional listen and laugh. If you haven't seen the movie you probably should because it will make the album better to listen to.
B002VWNIDG|3.0|It was partly as I expected but lots of things are missing or have changed from the book....  That was a little disapointiing
B005MHI0QM|5.0|I like to read Anne Frank 'porn' or not!, because it too read sexy stuff. Including sexy Mario, sexy Sonic, sexy Kirby and the other video game characters! Nice?
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very clean and entertaining show.  Heard about it from some friends who raved about it.  Glad I took their advice and started watching it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game without being frustrating like all the other escape games I've played. Would love more levels to be made.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Missed this series when it first aired, but started watching it on Amazon Prime because of recommendations of many friends.  Can't wait until Season 4!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It doesn't take long to complete the game, but the concept is great. the puzzles are somewhat challenging, and the artwork is good. the only issue i have is that it doesn't retain the sound settings when exiting the game.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|This is a great Nicholas Sparks movie.  It is a little different than most of his movies because he has added a little mystery with some surprising twists and turns towards the end of the movie that will catch you completely off guard.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is utterly heart-warming, extremely humorous, but also heart-breaking... definitely a must-read<br />I just fell in love with Augustus Waters as well as Hazel
B004P12SSW|5.0|If you like a movie with music and dancing you should like this movie.  It is different from a lot of musicals because the music is from the burlesque era.  It looked like so much fun I tried to find somewhere nearby that actually was based on this type of music.  It also has a great cast with Cher, Christina Aguilera, Kristen Bell and Julianne Hough.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This was an amazingly well written story. I fell in love with the characters and enjoyed the details about what Afgan women have endured through war.  I would highly recommend this book!
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I LOVE THIS KINDLE FIRE HD CASE. THE ORANGE IS A BURNT ORANGE COLOR, WHICH I LOVE. IT JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.
B008220BLG|5.0|Loved it. Saw it at the theater and had to add it to my collection. Great for all ages except very young due to frightening zombies.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|I have been abused in the past by an ex-husband, and the determined psychopathic hatred and vengeance portrayed in the book is very true to character.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|When I read what the movie critics said about this movie, I decided to not see it in the theater.  But after watching it at a friends house, I thought it was a good movie, that holds up well to the original; much better than the second one.
0263234541|3.0|This was a fun read. It is not a complicated story line although there is enough emotional angst to really twist your heart. The two main characters have plenty of emotional baggage, and they use that to justify their cold hearted approach to marriage. I did like that it wasn't the traditional usage of the \\"married in Vegas... now what\\" trope. It wasn't about winning big, or being motivated by money.<br />I think that Ms. Kelly did a fine job creating believable characters with relate-able flaws. There was a tangible connection between them that they both tried to fight.<br /><br />All in all it was an pleasant, light read.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|I liked this movie much better the second time around.  I mainly wanted to see this for the computer graphics, which did not fail to impress.  Otherwise the movie struggles to find a middle ground between being a kids movie and also satisfying enough for adults to watch.  Consequently it falls a little short in both cases.  But it is good casual entertainment.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie, excellent portrayal of the hulk and all the characters are well-played.  Fun, looking forward to more great comic awesomeness!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Not the exquisite storytelling of his earlier works. The characters you want to love aren't developed enough. There are loose ends. Not horrible, but left me disappointed.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Learning to let go of fear and trust in being who you really are. Ss proudly explained in this marvellous story of courage and attitude. A recipe for all of us on how to live our lives. Bravo Anita.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was hooked on this show after hearing Whoopie on the View talk about it. I watched it and I am so hooked I couldn't wait for season 3 to be available on PRIME. Now I cant wait for season 4.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|I'm not sure just why I love this movie, but it's a classic in my collection.  I finally retired my VHS to purchase the DVD.  It's an at-least-once-a-year watch.
B00C70FH7M|5.0|tesseract remains one of my top favs as a djent/metal/progressive whatever band. I got into these guys back before the full length 'One' was released(with all the songs from the EP sandwiched between new songs at the beginning and end. I was a bit bummed that I bought a full length with 70% of the songs being jams I already heard but it all went together well and I was happy. This record is definitely a bit different with a new singer and guitarist I believe, I may be wrong, they've changed ever so slightly. The screaming from the last two releases is gone as with the old singer and this new guy, seems to be someone who has had extensive vocal lessons by the perfect vibrato in his voice and the note changes are fantastic. My one and only gripe with the record is the sax. I'm not a Michael Bolton fan and I would like to keep that stuff as far away from my metal as possible, but with these guys obviously knowing a lot about music, and a lot of bands like these having jazz backgrounds I can't say I'm entirely surprised. I got the chance to see these guys a couple years ago in FL when my band and i were doing a headline tour and some friend(Protest The Hero) were touring with these guys and Maylene and The Sons Of Disaster and were right down the street and they were album perfect. So if they're in your area, GO SEE THEM!! All and all another amazing tesseract release. Keep it coming boys.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|highly recommend this for those who don't like doing math in your head and i am one of them...this is a great item to have....
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is great it is good for all ages. and it is fun to do if you are hoard
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I am very pleased with this app... I downloaded it because I wanted to be able to log-in to my work desktop/server remotely and eliminate the hassle of having to lug around my laptop everywhere. Now I can just take my Kindle Fire with me and if I need to check something, send a file, or get some work done on my free time, it's very convenient. I have no complaints. Not everything is going to be perfect (i.e. if you are logging in from a Kindle Fire, it's not a full PC o/s platform, so you have to get used to scrolling and using the keyboard and making selections, etc.), but I think it's worth it, especially for 9.99. I definitely recommend this product!
B00821OX98|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic series. It's Aliens meets Heroes but better. The characters are deep, the scenes are high tech and the story is immersive. The demographic for this show is actually quite a bit wider than I first thought because of its depth. It is easy to get really sucked into it and feel like you are a part of the 2nd Massachusetts. An absolute must see.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|Yeezus is another great album from Kanye West. The album is a blend of 808 & Heartbreak, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and Graduation, with tracks like Blood on the Leaves, Hold My Liquor, and Black Skinhead. But West is certainly more aggressive and less apologetic this time around. Yeezus is more angry and spiteful than the love songs from 808. The music and the beats are incredible, which is to be expected from Kanye. However the lyrics are so &#34;out there&#34; it's almost impossible to relate to anything he is singing about. Here's to hoping Kim Kardashian breaks his heart and we get another 808 & Heartbreak.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|It's very unclear how to use this app.  I had to read instructions several times and it doesn't work well in darker places.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Love the original cast to &#34;Kinky Boots&#34; even not having seen the play, have seen the film.<br />Great translation from film to musical play.<br />It's the Kinkiest!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love the writing and acting in this show. It is very well done! Hope it continues to be renewed yearly!
B00AB7IA1S|3.0|On my Kindle Fire HD the game is completely upside down... what's up with that??? Just started playing it and don't want to continue holding it at a weird angle just so it doesn't flip on me...
B00992CF6W|5.0|It needs to have a boat and a fishing rod to fish and get fish and then  More DIMANDS and armor
1856697525|5.0|I knew a lot of things from Bass, but this book surprised me. Consistent, complete and elegant. I recommend to all graphic designers and students.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Is a great free game they did well and made it fun . Good job guys. It's extremely addictive .go and get this free app now . And if you are reading to this part of the text u did not listen to me so go get this app!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Google play store is on version 5.00 already what could possibly be taking so long. This ver sion is so pixalated on my galaxy s3 that it is almost no fun to play.<br /><br />Please update soon.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|I've read many of the Jack Reacher books and wondered how the smaller, Tom Cruise, could pull it off.  He did, and did it well.  I'd like to see more.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Not bad.  I've seen worse.  Love Jeremy Iron's character... but then I like anything he is in. nice way to kill time.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I don't think you can get more classic 80s than this.  A true classic.  Highly recommended for a light hearted romping good time adventure.
B00632HWOG|4.0|makes it a lot easier to find my mail and spend less time typing.  Highly recommend it and that's enough
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is very good. The instruction is very helpful, and the guns are historically accurate. The M-1 Garand even has the ping. The only thing I want is for it to have more guns.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|The watch is really very nice, but the second had does not stop when you pull out the crown so you can't set the seconds. I'm a bit of a stickler about setting my watch. I like to set it to the closest second and then see how well it keeps time, so I was disappointed about this lack. Other than that I would give the watch five stars.
B00C70FH7M|3.0|Wow! The HYPE! Now for a more subdued review, unlike some others here! I saw a lot of hype and thought I'd jump on the bandwagon to see if I could realise the same things other people have here. Not to take away from other people's experiences, but this wasn't a special album for me.<br /><br />What I like about Altered State:<br />- I love clean vocals in alternative rock / metal. I think the whole growling stuff can sometimes be unecessary and takes away from the musical experience. I think the vocalist does a fantastic job and if not particularly unique, his vocals are strong.<br /><br />- The lyrics. The lyrics to me, while not particularly metaphysical, metaphorical, philosophical, or powerful, are reasonably well done and they are meaningful. I can associate with them. They are about life and not hatred and that's another thing I look for in mature music.<br /><br />- The musicianship. This was both a plus and a minus for me, as I will describe below. For the positive, the musicianship of course is great. They have created one long concept progressive album which takes the listener through a variety of moods. It perfectly balances hard and soft, never staying in one place too long.<br /><br />- It is a dynamic album. It can be heard from start to finish in almost any setting. You dont need to like metal necessarily to like it.<br /><br />What I did NOT like about Altered State:<br />- There is honestly nothing here I have not heard before. From Dream Theater, Rush, Tool, Karnivool, OSI, Ghost Brigade, to the variety of 'djent' inspired Meshuggah clones that have cropped up in places, this band is not presenting anything new to me that hasn't either already been done or done better. While I don't think Tesseract is anywhere near a Meshuggah clone, I would think those people who find Meshuggah too much to handle turn to Tesseract. I would hesitate to even compare Tesseract to Cynic because they're not as technical. What they are doing is *refining* a known formula - it doesn't necessarily make it so praise-worthy or unique and so I was stumped as to why there was such a fuss about it. Even online reviewers got down on their hands and their knees for Altered State and I could only surmise that most of these people were relatively young and hadn't heard this type of stuff before. Use of the sax was the highlight of this album. (Although just saying that Candiria, the post-metalcore band already did that too, more effectively). So, for me, this is a negative. They do everything really well, but the thing is... I've heard all of it already. It makes a nice album for certain but I don't have the heart to 5-star it, simply because a lot of other people are new to this. It does not give me anything greater than what I could get from a lot of other bands.<br /><br />- Despite all the positives, this band doesn't challenge me. It is very balanced and therefore, it isn't extreme in any particular area. I know I won't get a rush while listening to it and it doesn't lift me up in any particular place, because it feels quite safe. Too safe. There are no areas of this album that make me want to bob my head, that make my heart ache, or really make me want to return often enough. If you can't find a reason to return to it after a few listens, well good luck wanting to return it consecutively for the following years. Make no mistake, I don't dislike it - I just don't think it's special.<br /><br />- Same vocal style throughout. In certain albums by certain bands, the vocalist says something that makes you want to sit up and listen. I don't get that with this album. While the music is dynamic, the vocal delivery isn't. While the content is emotional - the delivery is uniform. I kind of know what's going to be said around the corner. I kind of know what instrument / sound is going to be played in the next bar. It has gotten a bit predictable quickly and that's not an enjoyable thing after the 2nd or 3rd listen.<br /><br />So overall, I thinkAltered State is good. Not great. It will be great for many people new to this genre. I noticed the comparisons some people have made to other bands, and that in itself is quite telling - you see where people's experiences with music are at and why they rate it so highly. For older fans or those who have been exposed to a lot more music, it is just a good album that over time might leave a faint imprint in people's minds but certainly not an irremovable mark. It isn't THAT strong, it's just a good listen, a well produced album that can lead a record label to where they want to be with strong marketing. I would recommend that people who liked this a lot should perhaps try Parallax 2 by Between the Buried and Me and then come back to Altered State for an honest review.<br /><br />For that reason I give it 6.5/10. Well done to this young band, keep it up, but a little too much attention and hype for a band that hasn't moved mountains. Let's see what you produce for your 3rd and 4th albums? Can you challenge the genre and produce something truly powerful? Look forward to it.<br /><br />If you agree or disagree and want to have a discussion about it, feel free drop a comment. I'm open to changing opinions on certain things, just not all.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|A little too gruesome at times but generally well done.  Interesting enough to keep you going.  Enjoy a decent read.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|Evil Dead is really less of a remake and more of a re-imagining of the original. I like that they didn't try to find an Ash look alike or try to re-invent the character. Bruce Campbell is Ash, I don't think anyone would have been able to pull the character off without alienating fans. Evil Dead also brings something to the table that has been missing in horror movies for a while, ridiculous amounts of violence and gore. This is not your PG-13 horror that we have had shoved in our faces lately. This is classic horror with so much over the top gore that you leave the theater and feel like you need a shower. I'm not talking about Hostel style torture porn, this is just ridiculous gore, it passes the point of being &#34;too real&#34; and allows you to have fun with it rather that simply feel uncomfortable.<br /><br />I can totally understand how other fans of the originals might not enjoy that, for them, we still have the originals. Those movies are still there and we can watch them as often as we like. This is just another way to enjoy the fiction.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Everything just fits: The chemistry between the characters, the story, the setting - and there is always a twist ;-)  TV entertainment at it's very best!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Have read Hosseini's books and I consider this his very best. A wonderful must read for all who liked the Kite Runner
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|It was Okay, first half was very slow and not well acted. The last quarter of the movie picked up and was more interesting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I find having this on my Kindle to be super convenient.  Works well and is also very easy to use.
0718178130|4.0|In Graeme Simsion's \\"The Rosie Project,\\" Professor Don Tillman is a brilliant but quirky geneticist. He speaks formally and precisely, is socially awkward, and plans his weekly activities--including exercise, shopping, and meals--in advance. Unsurprisingly, when he was young, his classmates bullied and teased him. Now approaching forty, Don is physically fit, proficient in various martial arts, says exactly what is on his mind (not always a good idea), and has decided that it is time to choose a mate. Instead of looking for dates in the usual way, he designs a questionnaire and distributes it to potential Mrs. Tillmans. He will weed out unsuitable candidates by screening their answers, eliminating vegans, women who smoke and drink too much, take horoscopes seriously, and are mathematically challenged.<br /><br />As an example of Don's tunnel vision, he cannot look at a person without computing his or her BMI (body mass index). He finds it difficult to relax and enjoy the moment--that is, until the profane, impulsive, fun-loving, and chronically tardy Rosie Jarman enters his life. She is everything that Don is not, and to make matters worse, she is a nicotine addict. Yet there are aspects of this woman that Don finds strangely appealing. He agrees to provide expert help when Rosie sets out to identify her biological father.<br /><br />Australian writer Graeme Simsion mines Don's many oddities for laughs. For example, Don gets into trouble when he violates a restaurant's dress code (what's wrong with a Gore-Tex jacket in a formal dining establishment, he wonders?); unwittingly insults women whom he interviews for the role of future spouse; and gradually realizes that love cannot be reduced to spreadsheets, graphs, and statistics.<br /><br />This is a breezy and heartwarming debut novel, but the humor is a bit heavy-handed at times and the plot unfolds predictably. In addition, Don's success as a tenured professor requires a sizeable suspension of disbelief, given his reserved nature and clumsy interactions with the majority of people he meets. However, the author effectively exploits the clash of opposites and demonstrates that, even though Rosie and Don appear to be wildly dissimilar, they are alike in more ways than they could ever have imagined.

B0025WX2YW|5.0|History, costumes, a feel for the period, lots of drama. beheadings and sex. What could be better! I love the whole series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|WOnderful Story line and it's an amazing series, so sad I have to wait until January for the 4th season!!  It hooks you from episode one!!
B00881VLCE|1.0|I rated this a 5 star in the beginning,  but since this app updated it is very difficult to play. Hard to get the pieces to move.  not worth even playing because of how slow it is.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is so much fun, some of the simple stuff can boggle my brain that I have to laugh at myself.  I will be looking for more apps like this. Hours of fun...
B000ION79Y|1.0|Steven Seagal used to be fantastic.  NO MORE!  This movie was so lousy that I honestly don't remember seeing a worst one.  This movie flat out and out stinks!  Don't waste your money or your time.  I am so disappointed.
B004XWLN20|4.0|Like others, I too found that the DVD's are getting rubbed a bit taking them out of the &#34;secure&#34; holders. I plan to only watch this one time and be done. It was a great add to my Superhero collection of DVD's & Blu-ray's! I would give it 5 stars if the container was better. I do like that the DVD's don't fall out if the container if it is tipped over though. As far as regretting the buy or swaying others to just get the series season by season, I'll say this...I had 3 of the later seasons in blu-ray, in my hand at the local store. On sale for under $20 each, too. I put them back, waited, and found this great deal on Amazon! I read the reviews and was aware of the rubbing/scratching. When this set arrived, I held it in my hands and had a big smile on my face! That's how I knew I made the right decision :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The game is awesome I would recommend it to all the people I knew and I have get this game!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoy playing graphics are good  and the game holds my attention,so I had to purchase full game. Buying a game is rare for me game has to be at least a 4 rating to get my cash. Had no problems on my kindle with game just took a minute for my download.  Good game
B005DJREJS|5.0|reminded  me of My so Called life that used to be on ABC.  The only thing that sucks is I have to watch season 3 on mtv.com
B003QP4NPE|5.0|This book is amazing.  It takes technology that is nearly in place today and uses it in revolutionary ways.  It is one of my top books to recommend to anyone who is interested in technology.  If you only read one more book, read Daemon.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Great product!  Love the 24 series...Jack Bauer is awesome!  It's fun to re-watch the seasons...getting ready for the new season next summer!
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|This was fun for an afternoon, but there is no desire to watch this film a second time. Recommend rental only.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved Sylvia's first two books in this series....and she doesn't disappoint with this one.  Hot and sexy love story! Can't wait for the fourth book!
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Karl Urban as Judge Dredd is AWESOME!<br /><br />This is a competent sci-fi movie as well as a great comic book-based story. Even the smallest details in the story are actually very cool science fiction elements. This is like Blade Runner on steroids. The violence is graphic and this is not a family friendly movie.<br /><br />My only regret is that there wasn't a sequel.
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|This is a tight little story with a terrific twist at the end that's worthy of an episode from The Twilight Zone. It tells of a moderately successful actor who recalls his whole career while preparing to watch the Oscars on TV.  The author writes very well, including seamless teasers for his novel, The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club. In this story, that book has already been made into an Oscar-caliber film. It's a clever device by a writer worth paying attention to. And since this short story is free, it's a nice way to sample this author's estimable goods before you plunk down cash for his longer work. Well done, Duncan. Highly recommended.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I figured it out but I still wanted to watch the movie to make sure what happened and to watch the actors.  The portrayals were great and it was an interesting and different murder mystery storyline. I recommmend it.
B00114RKT8|4.0|This is a historical drama that pays detail to historical fact and accuracy, is well produced and evenly paced - well acted that covers the story of abolition of slavery, along with the political mayhem that went with it.
B004A8ZWT2|5.0|Angelina is always good at Everything<br /><br />I had a movie collection of her movies.<br />She is good at all these acting thing.<br />Just love watching her passing in this movie.<br />Also thanks the reseller for the price drop
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found this game to be fun with the right amount of challenge and frustration! Learning with each level. Please design more rooms.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|A good movie! Lots of action and not too unbelievable.  Maybe Jack (or anyone) taking on five thugs and handling them with ease is a little far out. Maybe he's just that good.  The scene at the end of the car chase, where he blends into the crowd, was priceless. Keeping the foul language to a tolerable level was appreciated. Overall, I liked it, my wife loved it and wants to watch it again.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|my grandson 4yr love it simple to use ,great graphics,  love the tilled control and you cant beat the price. Will up grade  thank you
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Household ages are: 12, 38 & 55 and we all felt it worth the watch.<br />FX and color are excellent. The storyline and acting are plausible and easy to follow.<br /><br />Begins in B&W &#34;old format&#34; and grows to widescreen color as the scene transitions into the Land of Oz.<br /><br />This production is not a musical and that was not a negative point for us I only mention it for those who may expect it in light of the original film or the stage production of Wicked.
1469220725|5.0|For the people who didn't like the book, remember its meant to be fiction for entertainment, not reality. I for one looked forward to picking up my kindle every night and really hope that book 4 comes quickly.
B005HJ6MRO|1.0|White screen. White screen. Does anyone else think that the Kindle is slow for firmware updates and fixing problems like this? Ever since buying a Kindle I have been extremely disappointed with the interface. Not to mention they drop the price by $50 bucks just months after I purchased it.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Sweet!  I dislike the end, but oh we'll, I am just a romantic!  The most sweet and romantic book I've read in a long time!  It stays with you!!  I will read it again, and again!
B004TI5N38|3.0|I prefer the King & Maxwell series, but I can see the John Puller novels becoming bigger if the plots were more plausible and Puller himself was a tad more human.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I've probably listened to this album fifteen times in its entirety at this point, and all I can say is that it was worth every ounce of hype. I don't love every song, but it's a great album front to back. I think it's meant to be listened to as a whole. Highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great graphics. Good game to kill some time. Lots of different actions to perform so it doesn't get old fast. Good for all ages.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Vampire Weekend have made another classic rock album. Their first two records were excellent, in my opinion, but Modern Vampires of the City is their masterpiece. It sounds less like a VW record and more like, just, a great rock record. If you like Vampire Weekend, there's no way you'll be disappointed. If you haven't been a fan, this one may convert you.
0425263924|4.0|It wasn't amazing but it wasn't horrible. Most of the reviews are 1 and 2 stars from what I see, but I did enjoy this book. It was kind of slow at parts but in all I think I would buy the fourth book when it comes out. :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i first played this at my cousins it good enough to down load on my ahaha kindle fire andnlet me just say its dang good
B009VB7QQA|1.0|I don't understand what the hype was for. I tried to read the book (kept falling asleep) and watching the movie was almost torture.  It was  ridiculous and this is coming from an individual that likes Sci-Fi, Horror, and history.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Fantasy, mythology, science fiction, action, suspense, thriller, inter galaxy, alternate dimensions, within a modern day contemporary, small town everyday ordinary setting.  I am glad they left hope of a return visit.
B00913P6G0|5.0|OK - I absolutely LOVE this CD!!  All the songs & beats are good.  I'm new to Kendrick and now I'm hooked.  I bump this CD always and when I switch out to a different CD - I always come back.  I just let the whole CD play thru then REPEAT.<br /><br />GET IT - especially if you like West Coast rap and even if you don't.
B003O86FMW|5.0|waiting for it movie! so i read it again and againg , make sure i can remember every line on nov.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I really apreciate adams brown's courage and grace. This is a must and you will be glad reading it. Bet it!
B005HSL626|3.0|Ok for the most part but does not respond at times. My son likes it but gets frustrated that it freezes up or just doesn't work.
B005LAII80|5.0|I don't know why this movie didn't do good at the theater. It was one of the best in 2012.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Solidly made, quality zippers, nice finishing, easily adjustable velcro. I carry a camera body and four lenses with minor peripherals and an Ipad in the outer pocket - still roomy and secure. I almost missed this one due to the reviews saying it was low quality. Perhaps a different factory? Certainly better quality control with this one. The low price scared me as well, but glad I took the chance. I've had too many cases that proved inappropriate.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read these a while back, but I Loved all three books. Finished them in less than five days. Would definitely recommend.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Smart, sad, beautiful, joyous, and wonderfully well-written. Cultural commentary from the inside and out, with romance and relationships threading through. Now I want to read her other books!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched all of the 3 seasons of Downtown Abbey.  It really is done beautifully and you get to know and enjoy the characters.  Each episode leaves you wanting to watch the next one.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|This movie made you feel like you were experiencing the adventure with the the characters in the movie. The special effects were awesome. Are there really giants out there?
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|While many of us do not like to even think about war ( our loved ones being so far away from us protecting America ), this movie really touches one heart; great acting from all characters; rent, or, purchase it today...you'll be glad you did.
B0000549B0|5.0|This movie is one of the best comedies of all time.  I loved it when I was a kid, and my kids enjoyed it when we watched it with them.  Jimmy Stewart at his best.  Great acting by Harvey, too.
0615782043|4.0|With vibrant prose, erotic sensuality, and simple fluidity Revenge Of The Orgasm delivers a mouth watering appetizer on each page.  The writer delivers a rewarding portrait of eroticism and an unrelenting detail of sex and intimacy told in poetic form delivered in story.  A talented story teller with the pen, the presence of a future talented writer is indeed daunting. However, in a world of overly sexualized  books, movies, and etc. Writing erotica comes with a strong sense of stepping outside of the box and fine tuning the craft. It is imperative that the writer not only evokes the carnal senses yet those hidden deep within the mind. I strongly suggest a little bit more of developing poetic form, grammatical formations,  and delivering more than what`s expected of erotica. Arising the carnal flesh is one thing but transporting and stimulating the mind is another. I would highly recommend Revenge Of The Orgasm for lovers of poetry and erotica.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I liked the old version of this app.  It had a clean, easy to use interface.  Today, my Kindle Fire Original got an updated version which froze several times before I uninstalled the app.  The new version comes with an image background making it difficult to see the weather summary.<br /><br />I would give this app negative 5 stars if I could.  Instead, I have installed the free NOAA app.
B0053ZOQMK|4.0|My kids love this movie! Who am I kidding I liked it to, this is a great movie for the whole family!
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I enjoy reading the Jack Reacher book series and Tom Cruise so I wanted this DVD in my collection.  Followed book storyline fairly close to author's written version.
B00992CF6W|2.0|This app is the best app ever but I gave it 2 stars because kindle does not get the update at the same time as everyone else.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|this game looks realllly fun but I have been waiting for 2 days for this game to load and it still isn't half way!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm a fan of this series and enjoyed this one just as much as the other two.  Can't wait for the next one...
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I bought this originally for my phone but then realized it was for the kindle. It didn't say that when I bought it. After I put it on my kindle my grandson loved playing it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I just started watching this and I am hooked.  It's a great show, filled with family matters and law.  I would reccomend to family and friends.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game was not nearly as fun as the original. It was a lot more moving around of the screen and the characters were not as fun.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is a great storyteller. There isn't much message trying to get through here, but the stories she tells are great.
B00275EGX8|5.0|I would recommend that everyone see this movie at least once. It is a great story and i'm trying to get everyone i know to see it.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This game is fun....in fact it's better than just fun...it tests your brain and your eye coordination. Keeps you guessing what your next move is gonna be. I play this kind of game on POGO and really like it so thought I'd give it a try on my Kindle Fire....now the problem is getting it away from the grandkids!
B0094WK9EC|5.0|Just like Until One I love the entire thing. Every single track is amazing and i'm so glad that i spent the money to get the entire album instead of just a few songs of itunes.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this game is the best game I have ever played you destroy things the people who made this game thank you so much you guys are the best
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Its a great and kind of addictive game. Easy controls. (Being all you have to do is move your finger.) Dollar was worth it.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I'm careful about &#34;wasting money&#34; on DVDs but didn't hesitate to buy this movie the day it came out. Entertainment at its finest. I would definitely go for a sequel if done by the same crew.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love this game. You can type in something and it appears right in front of you. And its not like it only has a few listed items. It has almost anything you can imagine. Type in flying rainbow crab. It actually makes it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Despite all the negative reviews about Sylvia Day continuing this storyline, I was extremely excited to find out that more books were to come about Gideon and Ava. This book is a fantastic new story especially if you were a fan of the 50 Shades of Grey story. I can't wait until the next chapter of this love story comes out. I couldn't put it down!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Why would they change? I can't find the weather at all with the annoying picture and all the ads. Give us back the old version of TWC! I have deleted you. Looking for something new that I can see. I hate even giving it a1star.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Good additon to the Marlvel line.  Enjoyed the WW2 action aventure nature of this film.  I would recommend to anyone who enjoys comic book movies.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun! It's great for all ages! 10x better than temple run 2! It's very entertaining! Love it!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|HILARIOUS AND AWESOME! A MUST SEE IF YOU LIKE THE HULK,THOR,IRONMAN AND THE CAPTAIN. NO RESTING WHILE WATCHING THIS. LOVE IT!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun game. Race uphill with a driver who doesn't believe in rollbars. Win points to upgrade the vehicles. Use the gas and brake pedals for control.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Best movie ever, A must see for all families. Funny, adventurous and just all around good. Great fathers day gift.
006114665X|4.0|This book has an interesting history of relationships and rulers in the Balkan states. Then it settles into a very detailed recounting of the events leading up to the start of WWI. Since the purpose is to disprove the previously accepted belief that Germany and Austria-Hungary started WWI, the study of the interactions in the Balkans gets tedious. If you can wade through the material, you would have to agree with the author. However accurate the conclusion, this book makes you long for the writing style of Barbara Tuchman or Doris Goodwin.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I buy Rod's albums and a CDs as soon as they're released!  Always was and always will be my favorite!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I'm so disappointed. This used to be a great app with a layout that was simple, organized, and easy to use. The new layout is terrible. It clutters my screen and is awkward to navigate. The forecast page is especially frustrating because I can no longer see the hourly precip percentages in a simple vertical table. Everything involves tapping and scrolling through flashy oversized icons and time blocks. I originally chose this app over many others for its detailed information, simplicity, and ease of use. The new layout looks more like it was designed for children who want to see pretty pictures than for adults who need a weather forecast.<br /><br />To the developers of this app, please give users an option to use the classic layout instead of this newer one. Seriously, would you please consider doing this? I can't tell you how sad I am that your good service is gone.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|nothing to complain about but the movie is nice but not tremendous. The acting is very good but the plotline is totally expected and clichéd. that said, if you like Maggie Smith, and I do, its always worth seeing her in any film.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Serious fun!  Just when you think you want to give up, there it is!  I am definitely hooked.  Hope this keeps going.
B003L77G6K|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is one of the best comedies on tv, great cast, acting, writing, etc., etc. Jim Parsons steals the show in my opinion.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|No real plot…I was waiting for some things to happened with main characters and only things that was happening was sex and more sex...after couple of chapters of waiting for something (?) I just was going thru the motion of reading the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game.... just needs more levels!!! It only has 10 levels which you can beat in less then an hour.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This is probobly the most interesting one to me.  Something started happening beside sex so that one kept my interest almost to the end.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I just love Temple Run. I own all 4 versions. This one is my favorite!!! It has kept me busy and amused for hours!!! It has great change of scenery so if you get tired of one you just go to the other. A must have!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Bought this one cause I bought the first one....not impresed either.  Again very weak plot, main characters are boring to me.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Although this book took me awake to read, I feel like it was a book I should have read. It was long and sometimes it felt repetitive but in the end everything written made the grand picture of the story. This book had twists at the end, and action and love and everything you can think of. It's a great sci-fi/futuristic read. I approve therefore I recommend!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm so late to this party but I had heard the buzz about this book for a while. Such a great read. So many levels -- in so many ways. It's a political commentary, a society mirror, a touching science fiction novel. What a world Hugh Howey has imagined. Or is he just showing us the near future?
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book has been one of the most inspiring and mind opening books I have read. It is a great read for everyone yound and older but, especially for  those unconventional thinkers.
B008B68IV8|5.0|I have had problems finding these dolls. They are what every little girl want these days. Amazon has made it easier with so many choices. The delivery was so quick and came faster than I thought this was a great purchase.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|I like sonic if you try the game you will love it to.If you just try you are garinted to love it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Only negative , it comes up as download error at times. So it interrupts other websites. The Bible references are great.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this has been fun to play its always a new task to do and the rooms are always changing keeps the game fresh I would recommend to play
B00AMBMF1Y|5.0|Wonderful movie with an all star cast. I really wasn't interested in seeing it at first. Figured it was just another boring sports movie. Clint and company proved me wrong!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It's really awsome,I Iike the fact that you can connect to Facebook with it and the different backgrounds and stuff like that I will highly recommend it to anyone who is an uno lover
0553382152|5.0|I am religious but not a fanatic.  I recommend it to those who have lost a family member for whom they may still be grieving.
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|Frustrating at first because I used the on screen buttons and they suck. Switched to tilt screen and touch for gun, this worked fantastic. The game gets better when you get the chainsaw and the shotgun. Be sure to conserve AMMO!<br /><br />If the on screen controls were more responsive it would get a 5 star.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Sexy bikers, sassy ladies, drugs, guns, alcohol, and a healthy dose of violence. Great show. I wish I would've started watching when it premiered on TV, but now watching on Amazon, I get it with no commercials, so, SOA, FTW!
B0073COMUW|4.0|I have been gradually phasing out my fluorescent bulbs (good riddance) and generally very pleased with the LED replacements.  I've purchased soft white bulbs from Amazon and they have been perfect.  I was hoping this bulb would be the same but perhaps more powerful and &#34;bright&#34;.  The light from this bulb is VERY white and IMO it is harsh.  I initially placed it in a lamp in our family room but soon moved it to a hallway light which is used only occasionally.  My advice is to go with soft white for your living areas and order this one only for areas that you want very bright white light.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|My 4 year old beat me at this game! We both enjoyed it and had a good time playing it together.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Try to watch &#34;Before Sunrise&#34; before you watch this one.  Same characters nine years later...literally. the dialogue is so natural and full of meaning, the scenery is wonderful, and the actors are superb. Can't wait to see &#34;Before Midnight&#34;, the next movie in this series.
B00ATP24SW|5.0|What can i say? Stratovarius has been kicking booty in the Rock world for years! This Nemesis album will only serve to further prove that point! If there is one European Rock/Metal band that is worth going to see live, it has to be Stratovarius. Even the best guitar players, drummers, and keyboard players know that these guys are at the TOP of the music game. Add this Nemesis album to your collection today!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a fun story to read!  Was not disappointed at all. Although obviously predictable, it still stayed fresh and new.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|If you like the classic Thin Lizzy songs, and you love Classic Rock, then this is a perfect album for you. I really have enjoyed the new music that still has a familiar Thin Lizzy soul to it. Well done, Black Star Riders!
B002OKO1GI|5.0|Can watch it over and over. I think I just came to the U.S. when it came out. Brought back memories.
B00BURWSHA|5.0|This is what Whitesnake used to sound like back in the Red haired hottie and the Jaguar car days...and I love that! No &#34;Still Of The Night&#34; epic track that will be played for fifty years, but it is a really good and Rocking album! Burning Rain is a pleasure to listen to. Especially with this new Epic Obsession album. No bad songs to be found, and some Class AAA guitar playing! Nicely done. :)
B001NFNFIK|5.0|I had no idea \\"In the Electric Mist\\" was based on a novel! While browsing my cable provider's on demand offerings I saw the cast listing and thought \\"wow! This could be good!\\" Well, it was beyond good.....I'd even say GREAT!!!.  My adult son and daughter watched it with me and they also shared my enthusiasm for this very fine film.<br />All 3 of us had NO idea \\"In the Electric Mist\\" was based on a book, so I disagree with previous reviewers who think reading the book is necessary to understanding the movie.  Absolutely NOT so!!<br />In closing, if you enjoy intelligent thrillers with an indie feel this flick is for you...I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
B00BHMF578|5.0|My wife and I rented this from Amazon Prime. It is a great movie... a must watch for sure. 5 stars!
B00992CF6W|5.0|play all the time.  can't get enough of this one thank you.  would recommend to friends and colleagues. its great
B001706I5I|5.0|My family and I have a tradition every December to only watch Christmas movies. We have a ton of them in a big Christmas wooden box and we randomly pick movies throughout the season to watch. This is a tremendous addition to the collection!
B00C7KXUOE|4.0|This show is pretty graphic. Great mind twisting drama and plot. Very creative writing. But my wife and I went on a marathon of Hannibal right before bed time for about 3 days in a row. Man I had some odd dreams. Not nightmares, but odd dreams. Great show though. Just don't let it be the last thing you see before you close you eyes.
B00BI745AA|1.0|I know, I'm probably one of the few who hated this movie. I really, really liked the original, but this one... it was incredibly awkward how bad some of these people sing. Not my choice... it was painful.
B00CWVBTUU|4.0|Let me start by saying I'm a Bat Man fan. Bought this on the Roku to occupy my son while I fixed dinner. Started listening, and then ended up sitting down with him to watch. I found my self chuckling at some spots. A lot of inside-ish jokes for DC comic book fans. Pretty funny actually. Got me and my son started on watching other lego stuff. The Yoda Chronicles are pretty funny too.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|My family and I have a tradition every December to only watch Christmas movies. We have a ton of them in a big Christmas wooden box and we randomly pick movies throughout the season to watch. This is a tremendous addition to the collection!
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|Good for the Roku or to rent. Glad I skipped paying box office prices. Didn't hate it. Found it pretty entertaining, but it's not gonna win any Oscars.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|My family and I have a tradition every December to only watch Christmas movies. We have a ton of them in a big Christmas wooden box and we randomly pick movies throughout the season to watch. This is a tremendous addition to the collection!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great app!<br />it works well and is very challenging!I would recommend this app if you are looking for a challenge! makes you think!
B000N0W9WO|5.0|My family and I have a tradition every December to only watch Christmas movies. We have a ton of them in a big Christmas wooden box and we randomly pick movies throughout the season to watch. This is a tremendous addition to the collection!
B004UPALT6|4.0|I laughed more than I feel comfortable explaining here. Bruce Campbell is at his best here and I love him for it. Don't expect a serious horror movie. That was not the goal here.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|If you want to have a good laugh and enjoy the best parts of the movie, watch the previews... it's all there. My wife and I were very disappointed. We LOVE the cast, but it just wasn't all there.
B000I9U76A|5.0|My Daughter And I Love This Movie.  While There Is Mild Violence It Is Not Gruesome.  I Feel Comfortable With My 7 Year old Watching it.
B001UV4XFQ|4.0|I think this is the best of the saga... It is the one with the most action. My wife and I own them all.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like the 1st temple run game. I got this one because it was the 2nd. I like this version better. It was a lot more things that u can do while running. GET THIS APP.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the challenge for my brain each room presents a slightly different set of puzzles wish there were more
B008602KQI|3.0|Read the book if you want the story to make more sense and actually enjoy it. This is an OK watch, but nothing to see twice.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a page turner. Well written with twists and turns, I could not put this book down. The characters are interestingly depicted and the format is a change from the norm.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|If you like to flex your brain muscle... This is a great way to do so! It will make you think...
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It was a very good book. I like both the main charactors . Both of them have serious issues and it is because of what they have been through.
B0044DEAUA|4.0|My wife is not very tech-savy, and she was able to set this up and use it well.  She got very little complaints, and for the price, it is a great value.<br /><br />Giving it 4 starts the charger is a little awkward though, sitting perpendicular out of the piece.  It is concerning one day I will need to replace more then the charger giving this charges in a car where it could easily be bent again.  Charger broke within the first 2 weeks.
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|Arnold rules this remake 30 years later was a joke  . Good god Arnold could still play the role better today !
B005544TRQ|5.0|Enjoy the chemistry of the characters and great writing!  Love the story lines developing.  Keep up the good work.  Yeah.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|Loved it!!!! It is a must see, thought it was gonna be silly but really got into it right from the beginning.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Smart, funny, great writing, great acting...just discovered the show and have watched the first four episodes---really a shame that it got canceled so early.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|It is very different than other shows on TV and I love it. I recommend it to others all the time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so very addicting! i am loving every minute, it really makes you think! a real brain teaser all the way.
B007Z58RLC|5.0|This book has a depth yet clarity that I have not found in old philosophical books in a long time.
B006964E8S|3.0|the John Puller series reminds me of the Lee Child genre, but the character doesn't have some of the flaws (which make it more personal) demonstrated by Jack Reacher.  Entertaining and enjoyable read.
