B00000637V|5.0|I am a Lou Reed fan. Generally, I've always preferred his live performances, CD and DVD. However, without question, this album is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is a top ten album of all time.<br /><br />The emotional content of this album is unparalleled. The orchestration, the music, and the lyrics are virtually unrivaled.<br /><br />I read another review which made reference to Pink Floyd's, \\" The Wall.\\" I love that album; I love Pink Floyd; painful to say, \\" The Wall\\"  pales in comparison to this album. I have to be honest; \\" Berlin\\" is an incredible piece of work.<br /><br />Lou Reed bares it all; \\" Berlin\\" is unadulterated. It's deceptively simple; it's raw and easily accesssible. Maybe, \\" simple\\" is not correct. \\" Berlin\\" is just void of any pretense and bullcrap.<br /><br />It/life just is: pain and suffering intermixed with beauty.<br /><br />I've said enough.<br /><br />I absolutely applaud this piece of work.
6304293321|5.0|Based on a true story, as told by Joy Adamson in her book of the same title, this 1966 film remains compelling today. The movie follows the adventure of a British couple, game warden George Adamson and his wife (Joy, author of the book), living in Kenya in the 1950s, who become surrogate parents for a litter of three orphaned lion cubs. When the mother is shot in self-defense, the Adamsons bring the cubs into their home, planning to turn them over to the Rotterdam Zoo as soon as the zoo is ready to receive them. However, Joy forms a strong bond with the smallest of the cubs, whom she names Elsa, and ultimately cannot bear to part with her. So while Elsa's siblings eventually depart for the zoo, Elsa herself stays with the Adamsons. At first all goes well, but as Elsa grows into a mature lioness, it quickly becomes apparent that she cannot remain with her human family. And so, rather than send Elsa to a zoo and subject her to life in a cage, Joy is determined to do something no one has ever done successfully before - teach a tame lion to survive in the wild, and ultimately set her free.<br /><br />The acting is good, with real-life couple Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna playing George and Joy Adamson (McKenna also narrates the story as Joy via voice-over, pulling passages from the book). There are a few places where the dialogue seems slightly forced, but for the most part it is very sincere. The real star of the show, though, is Elsa herself, actually played by three different lionesses. You can really see the genuine affection between the large cat and her caretakers as they interact. It is magical to watch.<br /><br />\\"Born Free\\" relies on none of the modern-day tactics for holding an audience's attention. There is very little violence of any sort, no gore, no explosions, no sweeping romance, no sex, and as far as I could tell, not even a single swear word. The only fight scene is one between two lions, and the only chases are lions going after prey. Yet the movie maintains the ability to captivate a viewer entirely. It may hold the highest appeal for children, but animal-loving adults are sure to love it, too. I first saw this movie as a kid, but when I recently re-watched it after many years I was happy to find that it remained thoroughly enjoyable. I would warn, though, that very small children may possibly be frightened by the lion attack scene at the very beginning. The attack itself is now shown, but the lion's leap and the victim's scream are. I remember being a little unnerved by this part when I was little, so if you have a very young child, it may be best to watch this scene yourself first to determine whether it's likely to bother them.<br /><br />The one thing that worries me a bit about this story is the fact that the Adamsons actually used gunshots to call Elsa to them. Even at the end of the film, Elsa still displays no fear of either guns or humans. Such a lack of fear can be quite very detrimental to a wild animal, particularly in an area where lions are often shot to protect livestock. I don't fault the makers of the movie at all, since this is based on events as they really happened and the movie couldn't have been filmed differently without altering the story, but it's still a little worrisome.<br /><br />The entire movie was filmed on location in Kenya, and the scenery is gorgeous. Unfortunately, the picture quality is not as crisp as you would see in movies made today. However, it is full color and still quite decent. The sound quality is slightly disappointing. It is occasionally difficult to make out what is being said, but turning up the volume enough to hear the dialogue clearly in turn makes the music a little too loud for comfort. I have no idea if either the picture quality or the sound have been touched up at all in the DVD version, as I only own the VHS, but neither is enough of a problem to interfere with the enjoyment of the movie, and one can easily forgive these things in a movie made nearly four decades ago. On the whole, this is a terrific family film and is just as touching and fun as it must have been when it first came out. And if you're the type that gets a kick out of watching your cats watch TV, this one has the potential to catch their interest as well, as it did mine.made nearly four decades ago.

0393317552|2.0|The Establishment at places like the New York Review of Books and the New York Times Book Review, or indeed, academe in general, has a way of rewarding those who write books which conform to, and confirm, its basic prejudices while penalizing those heretics who do not. Traditionally, it was the Church who fulfilled this role, fighting against one heretical \\"natural philosopher\\" after the next--people such as Kepler, Galileo, Giordano Bruno, Descartes--until, by the turn of the eighteenth century, with hordes of experimental data giving confirmation to scientific theories, it became clear which worldview was out of date, and which current. Nowadays, it is the university system which--with its race, class, gender concerns, and its materialistic assumptions about the nature of the cosmos and the way it works--has become obsolete, and will go on defending its stiffening Image of the universe until the Western Mind simply outgrows it.     But in the meantime, along comes Jared Diamond, credentialed UCLA professor of geography, to lay out this university-stamped and approved vision of history for the rest of us idiots who just aren't savvy enough to keep up with the latest the university has to offer. One thing Diamond--along with his university colleagues--assures us of, is that all peoples are the same. Fundamentally. No one is any smarter, harder-working, more pragmatic, more dreamy and idealistic than any other. Every culture begins, apparently, on every continent, with the same batch of tabula rasa rubes who then set to work to see who can produce the first civilization. The only problem is, they don't have equal access to equal resources. The Australians hunted all their candidates for animal domestication to extinction early on, and so would never have access to draft animals, and along with them, wheeled vehicles to be pulled by such animals. Same thing with the New World, whose aboriginal peoples hunted all their large mammals to extinction just after the end ofthe last Ice Age. No draft animals, no civilization. Sorry. You guys lose. Oh, and writing? According to Diamond, only those societies with food production can produce writing, since they are the only ones who can afford to support a non-food producing elite of specialists; so hunting societies who do not have writing cannot keep records and therefore cannot keep tabs on who owes what to whom. (In Diamondworld, inventions only emerge for pragmatic reasons, never symbolic or ritualistic). Nevermind those examples of writing that Alexander Marshack pointed out on Paleolithic bone and ivory carvings, or for that matter, those geometrical figures that no one can decipher on the walls of Paleolithic caves. And don't trouble me with Marija Gimbutas and her insistence that writing began as coded geometries inscribed on pottery during the Neolithic. (She's one of those heretics).     Hmm. So let's get this straight. All those scholars who remarked on the temperamental differences between cultures, like say, between India as dreamy and idealistic vs. the West as mechanically inclined, are really just bogus. The only reason India ever specialized in metaphysics was because it didn't have access to certain goods and services on its continent, although I have no idea what Diamond thinks those natural resources might be, since India apparently has them all, including the cattle which are so sacred that they cannot be eaten even when people are starving (so much for Diamond's economics). There is no such thing as a lazy tribe in Africa vs. an industrious one. We just imagined those things because we were bigotted white men. And the only reason the West is so Imperialistic is because it originated on a continent and in a place teeming with natural resources and other such geographical advantages that those poor Native Americans or Australian aborigines never had. Hmm.     In Diamondworld, history is entirely determined by environmental forces, not human ones, and so human beings are just there like checkers waiting to be pushed about by natural forces. You know, just like Darwin said about evolution, \\"adapt or die!\\" So, his model is essentially a modernized version of an outdated Victorian model of Progress in which only those societies which accept sensible innovations like food production and animal domestication go on to become big Chiefs of Empire.      One of the major, major failings of this book is that Diamond has no undertanding of the true forces which shape cultures, i.e. ritual, symbol and mythology, or the way in which human consciousness has evolved in different societies to produce different mythologies which envision different ways of what being human is all about. And that sometimes those mythic visions can act as hindrances toward societies adapting this or that technology. But Diamond is a materialist, not a cultural theoretician. He's a good old all American pragmatist with a vision of history which is basically that of a white, middle class suburban man's in which a trip to Albertson's or Safeway is the high point of a day's events.      It's nice to know that the Establishment still awards Pulitzers to those who see in history only economic and materialistic forces. God forbid that they should ever reward someone who sees things like myth and symbol and vision and spiritual agony as the motivating forces. That would be closer to the Truth, and as Nietzsche was fond of saying, the Lie must be protected at all costs, particularly by rewarding those who reinforce our cherished illusions about life, rather than challenging them.  --John David Ebert
B00004XONN|5.0|If you listened to The Bends, OK Computer, and then Kid A, you might think Radiohead suffers from schizophrenia. Three instant classics, yet three albums with no single derrivative. The Bends being an all out rock album, OK Computer being melodic, progressive rock, and Kid A being experimental electronica.<br /><br />Despite the critical acclaim The Bends and OK Computer have garnered, I have to say that Kid A is my personal favourite of Radiohead's. The tracks follow a pace of uneasy lyrics with gorgeous sounding instrumental play. I have very few complaints about the album as a whole. In my opinion, it has one of the strongest starts to a CD in recent years. The eclectic \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\"; the soothing \\"Kid A\\"; one of the most avant-garde pieces I've heard in years, \\"The National Anthem\\"; the creepy \\"How To Disappear Completely\\"; the mysteriously dark \\"Treefingers\\"; and the upbeat anthemic \\"Optimistic\\". Any one of those first six tracks is worth the price alone. \\"In Limbo\\" is the weakest link to the album, but the pace again picks up with the synth-laden \\"Idioteque\\". Two beautiful tracks close out the album, those being \\"Morning Bell\\" and \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\".<br /><br />The lyrics on this album are deep, and it will take several listens to fully understand and be comfortable with, but it is well worth it. All around a rewarding musical experience that is crafted by some of the best in modern music. Never has Radiohead sounded so insipred, or so good for that matter. This is easily the best album of 2000.
0671027387|3.0|Dan Brown may have taken the world by storm with The DaVinci Code, but this earlier attempt at a thriller reveals an immature and formulaic author.  This doesn't mean that the book is without merits.  It is a quick, entertaining read with enough science and technology to appeal to the nerds among us, myself included.  But unlike Michael Chrichton, Brown's diverse forays into different technological areas are set in a basic plot formula that leaves little room for surprise.  In fact, it felt as though I was merely rereading Digital Fortress, albeit with new names and locations.  Even some of the plot twists seemed recycled.<br /><br />Were it not for The DaVinci code, I would have predicted that Brown would go the way of Clive Cussler, an entertaining author who rewrites the same book, over and over and over again.  I liken it to watching a popular sitcom.  The minor plot details change while the story remains the same.  The result is entertaining, and sometimes addictive (as evidenced by the fact that I own every single Cussler novel), but is more of a guilty pleasure than inspired reading.
B000002MFN|5.0|I'm one of the many who think that this album deserved to sell so much more. It sold 2 million but should have sold 10 million. It had no #1 hits when it should have had at least 5. Not so much about sex, it's an intimate album with some of Madonna's most accomplished work. Erotica, Bye Bye Baby, Deeper and Deeper, Where Life Begins, Bad Girl, Thief Of Hearts, Rain, In This Life, Secret Garden are the best songs, and that's most of the album! The other ones are also good. It got a bad rap because of the Sex book and the movie Body Of Evidence. But had those not been around, this album would have been huge because it was talked about by everyone at the time. Buy it, you'll love it.
0312263120|4.0|Ah!  The dangers of being a prolific author are revealed.  Like any artist, no author can be expected to produce brilliance everytime he places pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard).  The careers of most actors and directors are studded with a handful of masterpieces, a bulk of mediocrity and some dismal failures.  Dan Brown is no different.  I would count Digital Fortess as one of his mediocre attempts at fiction. <br /> <br />Do not take this to mean that you shouldn't read it though.  It is a quick, entertaining read that will satisfy most who open it.  Dan Brown explores the surface of cryptology, or codebreaking and the importance of the NSA or National Security Agency.  The story is plot driven, with action, violence, mystery and puzzles to solve.  Just don't expect well developed characters.  They tend to be predictable and fairly one dimensional.  But such prose is unneccessary to the story and does little to detract from what is just what it claims to be, a thriller. <br /> <br />I read Digital Fortress before I read Deception Point, and so that might play into my more favorable review of this novel.  Deception Point is merely Digital Fortress with a different setting, NASA instead of the NSA, and different names.   <br /> <br />If you like thrillers you'll enjoy this.  Just don't expect another DaVinci Code.
B000002MUW|4.0|After Erotica, Madonna obviously needed to lower the dosage. She came back with this album. Working with producers like Babyface, the album is very R&B flavored. At first it was a sales disaster until two songs came along. Secret became a huge hit with a funny premise and Take A Bow, her best ballad ever, and also her biggest hit. The album has sales on par with Erotica but deserved better. Human Nature, Survival, Bedtime Story and Don't Stop are the other highlights, and you can see the response to the lambasting of Erotica in some of them.
B00005JN2X|5.0|It started out like any other night. Cab driver Max (Foxx) picks up Vincent (Cruise) who tells him that he has a few stops to make, and offers him $600 to get him to agree. When a body falls out of the first stop and lands on his cab, Max realizes he is in for more than he bargained for. As it turns out, Vincent is a killer for hire who has arrived in Los Angeles to wipe out five people that are causing some trouble for his employer. Max has just become his personal chauffeur for the evening. Vincent's domineering, confident attitude is enough for the most part to keep Max in line. Gradually dragging Max into the \\"action\\" also serves to make Max an accomplice of sorts. Vincent also serves as a mentor of sorts, telling him that he needs to get off his butt and take action in his life. In the end, this could be Vincent's downfall, if Max can get it together and make a stand.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Collateral\\". While not action-heavy, the action scenes are very effective. The more pervasive interactions between Max and Vincent are gripping at times, as a strange relationship forms between the two. Cruise's Vincent is a bit of a departure for him, but he fills Vincent's shoes convincingly. Foxx as Max is equally effective as his character gradually develops some strength of character.<br /><br />This is not your typical action movie, but if you like a some thought in your movies, you will not be disappointed. This is a gem in the doldrums of the August box office. Check it out.
B00005J6T0|5.0|I really have to say that all the songs on this record are excellent. Of course, the standout tracks are always the hits. Open Your Heart is one of the most quintessential pop songs of all time. I love the Latin flair of La Isla Bonita and the 50s feel of True Blue and Jimmy Jimmy. I've heard White Heat in movies before and never realzed it and I love that song now. Live To Tell is one of Madonna's best ballads and it also is in a lot of movies. Where's The Party and Love Makes The World Go Round are fun dance songs. Papa Don't Preach is serious but another good dance song. Buy this record!
B00004VVND|4.0|Sunday, August 15, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Jurassic Park prequel<br /><br />Crichton mined the idea of a fun park gone awry in this 73 offering, long before dinosaur DNA replication would prove viable.  Richard Benjamin strikes the right chord as a wimp come survivalist guest at the Westworld resort, one of three that offer patrons the opportunity to interact with lifelike robot denizens.  As things are wont to do, it all goes haywire and Richard is stalked by gunslinger Yul Brynner to the death.  Pacing really heats up in the last 15 mins. as Benjamin seeks to evade Yul by running from one abandoned `world' to the next, ultimately ending up in the labyrinths below the parks.  While a bit slow in the beginnings James Brolin and Benjamin capture the feeling of being mischievous boys in an old west playpen.
B00008S2VG|4.0|American Life was following Ray Of Light and Music, two of the most acclaimed albums of Madonna's carrer. It sold 241,000 in its first week and quickly plummeted. Reviews were disastrous. <br />This album is actually good. The best songs are American Life, Hollywood, Love Profusion, Nothing Fails, X-Static Process, Die Another Day, and Easy Ride. Just when the album seems like its about to falter, in comes Die Another Day, a breath of fresh air and it's all good. It's not her best, but it's still very strong and deserved more credit. Thankfully the tour is a massive hit with everyone, so Madonna will stick around. But who said she was going anywhere?
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|Sunday, August 15, 2004 / 2 of 5 / Unappealing Finney<br /><br />While I typically love Tim Burton's work, I found Big Fish to be oddly polarizing.  Snippets of the life and times of the main character when played by Ewan McGregor are much more enjoyable than watching the bulbous Albert Finney `flounder' about in the present day incarnation.  The luminous Jessica Lang languishes in the role of the wife in present day, standing by as a prop while the dispassionately played son tries to synthesize reality and his father's tall tales fed him over the years.  An odd film, and not his usual quirky special way, it just didn't work for me.
B000002NJS|5.0|After the lukewarm reception of Erotica and Bedtime Stories, Madonna took one of her longest breaks. She did Evita and won a Golden Globe for it. But her greatest achievment was on the way. Ray Of Light opened to excellent reviews and sold 4 million copies, her biggest album in nearly 10 years. This was my first Madonna album but not my last. Drowned World, Ray Of Light, Candy Perfume Girl, Sky Fits Heaven, Shanti/Astangi, Frozen, Power Of Goodbye and Mer Girl are the best. That's most of the songs, too! They all rock actually! This is her most mature and important album. It's on Rolling Stone's 500 best ever list and deserves to be! Buy it.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Magnolia is one those rare films that I can watch over and over again and am always moved to tears by the final frame.  This is filmmaking at its brilliant best. <br /> <br />The scenes that stand out and touch me the most are Julianne Moore's emotional ourburst at the pharmacy, William H. Macy's heart wrenching speech of having love to give but not knowing where to put it, the goosebump inducing musical interlude to Amy Mann's touching \\"Wise Up\\" and of course the frogs.  Who can forget the frogs. <br /> <br />Everything about this film is perfect.  THIS is what movie making is about, a film lovers dream.  Top notch acting by a top notch cast, brilliant direction, excellent cinematography, an engaging plot and a perfect soundtrack.  One my top ten all time favorite films. <br /> <br />Brilliant!
B000002LND|5.0|One could say that 1990 was Madonna's year. She starred in the box office hit Dick Tracy. The movie was accompanied by a hit album featuring her smash hit Vogue. Her Blonde Ambition Tour was getting praise all over the world. In the winter of 1990, she would release what many consider one of the most important greatest hits albums ever. The Immaculate Collection covers Madonna's biggest songs of the 80s and a few new ones. Justify My Love is a spectacular song and hints at what was to come. Rescue me is the other new song but it's just as good. Selling 10 million copies, this is one of Madonna's bestselling albums and it shows us the magic she made back then; the magic she still makes now.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I'm not going to beat around the bush or anything.  Put very simply, this is a great story.  Whether or not you end up thinking it's the best one you've had ever read is kind of pointless.  It's still worth the read.  You'll be glad you did and have no regrets.
B000002MY3|4.0|I can remember when Alanis ruled the charts and she still deserved to, by the way. But Jagged Little Pill, while not her best, deserved everything it got. While the hits are the standout tracks, the other songs are also good, like All I Really Want, Right Through You, Not The Doctor, Mary Jane and Wake Up. Your House (the secret song) is haunting. AIRW is the best here, and it really does give you an idea of her style. It sold 16 million and deserved it. Many tried to imitate but none could duplicate this record.
B00000DC10|5.0|When i got this disc, i was not only surprized, i was blown away.. this band is amazing, hardcore to the extreme.. but not your normal hardcore... an they are not punk either.. they can simply be called refused.. pick up songs to fan the flames of discontent aloso.. its heavier and amazing as well..
B000002LGQ|4.0|Madonna's first three albums were, well, cheesy. The songs were good, but something was lacking...oh right! Seriosity. Is that a word? Anyway, Live To Tell and Papa Don't Preach were pretty serious, but Madonna needed to show the world that she could make catchy music with a message. That message came in the form of Like A Prayer. The title track is, of course, the best song, and the video is genius. Express Yourself goes against the Material Girl stance and says that objects don't matter, but talking does. Cherish is a classic. Love Song is forgettable. Oh Father is a look at Madonna's home life that we've never seen before. Till Death Do Us Part is a peek at the collapse of her marriage to Sean Penn. People hate Act Of Contrition, but I think it's a fun and relevant ending to the album. But I won't give it away. Buy the album and see for yourself! This album rejuvenated Madonna's slowing sales and, after selling 4 million copies, it's one of her best works.
0884271536|5.0|`Critical Chain' by Eli Goldratt is now a classic.  It is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn about critical chain project management (CCPM) or simply wants to open their eyes to a different project management approach.  The Socratic approach followed by Goldratt in explaining the CCPM concepts is effective and entertaining.  He finds the right balance between fiction, which prevents you from putting the book down, the theory behind CCPM, and the application of CCPM to development projects (with fictitious yet relevant examples).  This book is a great starting point for those who embark on the CCPM journey.
1400079179|1.0|An utterly worthless book, merely a tepid imitation of<br /><br />Umberto Eco's erudite literary magnus 'Foucault's<br /><br />Pendulum', it attempts to merge the secretive orders<br /><br />of the Renaissance with those of the superstitious<br /><br />dark ages in a pubescent detective approach. The fact<br /><br />is, there were no \\"dark ages\\", with regards to<br /><br />history, the power of the Church and Nation States<br /><br />actually killed more humans and uprooted more nomadic<br /><br />people in the Renaissance (the cause of continous<br /><br />warefare) than whatever occurred since after the fall<br /><br />of the Roman empire. Nothing is so thoroughly<br /><br />unconvincing, except perhaps the unadorned candor and<br /><br />writing style of the monotonous author, who purges<br /><br />every page with excessive description and repetitve<br /><br />action sequences found in a basic high school novel.<br /><br />The book was only created to gratify the audience of<br /><br />\\"city commuters\\", whose grasp on the iconography of<br /><br />history is minimal, and who still gobble this up in<br /><br />the droves at their bland suburban book stores and<br /><br />await the movie and sequel like pithy flies. Truly,<br /><br />works like this signal the death of authentic and<br /><br />extraordinary literature, a sad yet ineffective<br /><br />comment on modern times.
B000286RKW|5.0|Goodfellas is definately the best ganster movie to date! Yes Thats right! Godfather is great, but goodfellas also adds some dark, funny, refreshing material, unlike Godfather. Scarface also greatly overrated ( sorry folks to say that ) is only saved by Al Pacinos' acting. I own all three by the way. You have too, come on now. But the person trying to slip in the note about Raging Bull. ITS NOT A GANSTER FLICK! But a great movie also. I Also own Things to do in Denver when you're dead & King of New York. Two mob flicks that are very good. Check em out. Oh & Casino wasn't as bad as Godfather 3.It's like they had the JAWS syndrome. ( They didn't know when to stop)
0441003257|5.0|\\"Good Omens\\" is one of my favourite books (quite possibly my absolute favourite) and never fails to make me laugh. I must have read it at least 10 times and those little asterisk-marked notes at the bottom of the pages (or the \\"Footnotes of an Educational Nature and Precepts for the Wise by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman\\" to quote the book) have me laughing out loud every time I read them. There's something about the book that is just cumulative - the more of it you read, the funnier it gets. <br /> <br />The story moves along at a quick pace, never lingering too long on anything that could get boring, and the jokes come thick and fast. Yes, many of the jokes are UK-based (especially ones about Manchester and Milton Keynes) but a lot of the humour can be appreciated by anyone. <br /> <br />Sometimes I feel that the middle of the book drags - especially when the chapters involve Adam and his friends, but Aziraphale and Crowley (who must surely be the most sympathetic representation of a demon ever invented) are never far away to provide comic relief from the (when you think about it) quite serious plot. <br /> <br />From the opening paragraph (my God, but when the descriptions of the authors can have you laughing out loud then how can the book be bad?!) to the closing word, this is an excellent and extremely witty book. Well worth buying.
B00004Z1GH|5.0|Fantastic DVD here, and at a great price. You can also find an even more budget-conscious version, but there will be fewer extras.<br />Opinions on this film vary. Die-hard Cronenberg fans sometimes find eXistenZ to be a little lightweight. Especially when compared to more provocative films like Crash or depressing films like Spider or Dead Ringers. <br />On the other end of the spectrum, those unfamiliar with Cronenberg's work may find this movie to be too bizarre! <br />I won't talk too much about the plot, as other reviewers are better at it than I am, but I'll say that it's kind of a game within a game within a game (within a game?). Like a few other films of the day it explores the nature of reality (The Matrix of course is most popular). <br />eXistenZ was actually Cronenberg's biggest budget at 25 million (not including his current project A History of Violence). The special effects are fantastic, and there are some good moments of gore. A couple people get shot in and around the face. Yes, this is a return to his past in many ways, though again, in a slightly more playful manner. <br />There's plenty of extras on the DVD, most notably three separate commentaries and a long (almost an hour, I think) feature about production designer Carol Spier which mostly focuses on eXistenZ but also touches on some of her earlier work with Cronenberg. <br />Definitely worth getting, and an especially good introduction to Cronenberg's work (before moving on to more disturbing pictures like Videodrome and The Brood, and more slow, paced pictures such as Spider and Crash).
0790731479|5.0|It's hard to believe that this movie is over 15 years old, but BEETLEJUICE still is as witty and clever as anything that's come out since. The movie really put a lot of people on \\"the map\\" for good: Tim Burton, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Michael Keaton, and, of course, Winona Rider. Skewing the life/death relationships and putting the whole ghost story convention on its head, there are also other a lot of other issues being challenged: the city folk versus the country folk, folk art versus artsy art, and the house versus the home. And as far as the \\"Rest In Peace\\" concept goes... Fuhgeddabowdit! The dead are stuck in a worse bureaucratic nightmare than the New York City Transit Authority. All this makes for a wonderfully giddy film whose whole is a good as its parts.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I saw this movie last night, it is a very biased documentary, designed to open the eyes of the regular Joe (as myself) to the truth behind all politics (specially US foreign policy)...and I loved it!!! I disagree with many other reviewers, I don't believe Moore is badmouthing America as a nation. I believe this an attack on the system, and the George W. Bush administration (not to mention all of G.W.B. and G.H.W.B. connections to many shaddy deals and unethical businnes strategies). The truth is, having some of the top military forces in the world, this \\"problem\\" could have been resolved with some nifty covert-ops, and not sending thousands of young americans to a country they have no businees being in.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I love this Album, I was a little off by their Marillion.com and other productions, this one is really great, very symphonic rock, this is what Marillion is all about. If you like Marillion this is definitely the one to get. Steve Hogart sounds very good.
B00026YO36|5.0|I am glad to hear Lanegan is back and sounding like himself.  Queens of the Stone Age is an interesting side project, but not my cup of tea.  Another couple years of whiskey and cigarettes has made his voice rougher than before, and his songwriting has grown as well.  The list of guest artists on this CD is impressive but you quickly forget who is playing on what song since the songwriting is that strong, and since he is back to his signature style.  This one is harder-edged than most of Lanegan's solo work, but tastefully so.
B000244EMO|2.0|I enjoy the movie however this package is not worth buying. While the extras are awful I could live with them if something had been done to clean up the film itself. <br /> <br />Sometimes the film gets grainy and the colours wash out and neither has been fixed for this release. <br /> <br />Until they do some restoration I can't think that there is a reason to buy it. The original single disk package should suffice.
B0000DDAU9|4.0|Mastodon: \\"Remission\\": ...Very unique blend of New York hardcore and Georgia progressive metal...easily comparative to Neurosis and Isis though exhibiting notably less developed song structures...a very big and crushing epic sound with plenty of diversity and control...high caliber and very different from the standard metal core fodder...lyrics seem fairly meaningless, but not contrived or typical none the less...basic cookie monster vocals and more guitar \\"chords\\" than guitar solos...tough to describe, but a very worthy and intense CD no less...could be interpreted as mildly thrashy but I would say that all \\"stoner rock\\" comparisons are way off because these guys beat you to death and then give you an epic (though somewhat underdeveloped) instrumental...(warning: the bonus song on the DVD version sounds like a different band and almost ruins the whole disc)...
B000002I7H|5.0|This is not a compilation, but rather an expanded Atlantic edition of Albert King's Stax LP \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" from 1967.  \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" was Albert King at his most inspired, and most influential, too, a blueprint for young white guitarists like Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and even Jimi Hendrix and Joe Walsh. And it's no wonder; it was an immensely strong and unusually varied collection, spanning swaggering R&B, passionate soul-blues, mid-tempo hardcore blues grinds, and smouldering slow numbers.    \\"King Of The Blues Guitar\\" brings together all 11 tracks from the original LP, and combines them with six of King's excellent non-LP singles from the same period, everything presented in the order in which it was actually recorded.  The 1966 sides \\"Overall Junction\\" and \\"Funk-Shun\\" are both instrumentals, and very good ones, too, but both were left off the original \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\". Here they are, though, along with four more late-60s recordings which were cut by King and Booker T & the MGs shortly after the release of the \\"Bad Sign\\" LP.  The half-spoken '68 sides \\"I Love Lucy\\" and \\"Cold Feet\\" aren't really musical heavyweights, but they're good enough, and \\"You're Gonna Need Me\\" and \\"You Sure Drive A Hard Bargain\\" are particularly satisfying, tough blues numbers with a couple of great vocal performances by King. And thsoe horn charts? Perfect!    It must be said that this disc can't quite match the 2001 version of the \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" CD (the digipack) as far as fidelity is concerned, and the digipack edition is notably louder, which is nice, but the difference is nearly as great as some audiophiles claim, and this  is actually an excellent way to get all of \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" and an extra handful of early Stax sides at no additional cost!    This is Albert King at his best, some of the finest 60s blues and soul-blues you'll ever hear. Superbly played and exquisitely arranged, and the addition of the six non-LP singles actually make for an even stronger and bluesier set than the original \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" album.  Highly recommended!
B00005JNEI|4.0|I just saw F911 and had a severe occurence of deja vu.  This is just a recap of Dude Where's my Counrty.  I see what he's trying to do, but I don't think it will make a real difference.  People who hate Bush will watch this movie and it will cause them to hate bush even more.  The people on W's side either A. Won't watch it...or B. Watch it and pick out every bit of controversial information that M.Moore presents as fact.  Michael Moore is the democratic Rush Limbaugh.  He is extreme...he bends facts...presents theories as facts.....but at least he is on the side of good.  But seriously...is the antidote for a rich, self interest pandering, skull n' bones, silverspoonified white guy....a slightly taller, rich, self interest pandering, skull n' bones, silverspoonified white guy?  So Kerry will be more civil with France?!  Who cares?!  I hate all politicians...your vote doesn't matter!  If you like this ridiculous system of goverment then quit complaining!  It's going well for you.  If you hate this country like I do...then leave(I can't because I'm a felon).   Voting is pointless unless you live in a few select states.  And even then...it matters very little.  4 stars because I like the way Michael Moore conveys things and his humorous antics.  Anyone who says M. Moore is doing this for money is a fool.  He speaks from his heart and I believe he is a good man.
B00005AR3G|5.0|I love this film.  It is funny, light hearted, and pays homage to the actual Incan empire.  What I thought was most Ironic is that Cuzco is the name of the old Incan capital and as such the named the Emporer Cuzco in this film.  <br />     Anyone who has had to work in a kitchen or on a wait staff will also love Cronks take in the kitchen as a short order cook.  It is delightful and funny. <br />     <br />P.S.:  The irony is that this was a question on my geography final and I almost doubled over with laughter thinking about the poison.  The poison made especially to kill Cuzco. <br /> <br />Enjoy with laughter: <br /> <br />David
B0001XAPX8|3.0|This story explores two very different characters from opposite backgrounds, both of whom are estranged from their families and suffer terrible losses before finding a degree of contentment with each other.  The Anthony Hopkins character is very intriguing: a man who has reinvented his identity, only to endure the poetic irony of persecution for being who he is not.  The other characters are more one-dimensional and don't quite balance out the story; I wonder whether the book on which this is based is more nuanced.  Despite a good cast, good production values, and some strong scenes, the film feels like a jumble of unrelated episodes that never really meld.  Still, I found it fairly thought-provoking and reasonably engrossing.
B00027JYLC|5.0|Freaks is a powerful movie, one that may even push you to tears.  The reason to this is the fact that the \\"Freaks\\" are for the most part real  human beings who were born with deformities.  These actors were then cast as the circus freaks for this film.  In our ultra sanitized modern day life style we no longer are aware of the past. <br />     People like this existed. <br />     People like this had feelings. <br />     People like this were mercelessly tormented. <br />     Freaks shows us what it would be like living in the 1930's with a deformity such as this. <br /> <br />This movie is an eye opener and a must see. <br /> <br />Safe travels: <br /> <br />David

B00003CXRM|1.0|On 18 Feb  04, at 11:30 p.m., I watched the movie O Brother Where Art Thou.  I watched it played on a DVD medium in surround sound.  This film was produced by Touch stone / Universal pictures with help from Studio Canal and Working Title Productions.  The movie was made in 2000 and stared George Clooney in the title role.  His supporting cast was John Turturro and Tim Blake.  This film was presented in color.<br />  O Brother is a partially modernize story of Odysseus.  In this case the character George Clooney plays is called Ulysses Everett or Everett for shot.  He is on a chain gang and needs to get home.  He convinces his fellow convicts, Pete and Nelson, to escape with him.  Everett says he has stolen a million dollars and needs to get it before the valley he buried it in is flooded.  This will happen in five days, so the unlikely trio races against the clock to get home.<br />  Along the way the encounter several diversions that try to keep them from getting their prize.  First  the jump a train or at least a few of them do.  However since they are chained together they all fall out of the train.  They need to learn to work together, if they are going to make it to the money in time.<br />  Next they meet a blind man on a hand cart.  He prophesizes that they will find a treasure, but not the one they seek.  This causes some dissent among the men.  However Everett is able to keep them together and push them on.<br />  After the encounter with the blind prophet, they run into Pete's Cousin.  Hogwolop turns the three in for the bounty.  The depression is very severe and Hogwolop needs the money to save his farm.  The three are able to escape.<br />  The boys run into a baptism.  Pete and Nelson get saved but Everett decides not to. The two saved boys are ready to call it quits.  I think this parallels the encounter with the lotus eaters.  Instead of physical pleasure, the boys have a spiritual pleasure.  As such they feel that they have been absolved from sin.  Why should they move on?  Everett pushes them.<br />  They run into a black guitar player.  He tells them that they can make some money singing into a can.  They cut a record and this act gets them famous.  Even though the Soggy Bottom boys, as they are now called, do not realize it.<br />  There is an encounter with three women.  When they wake up Pete is gone and the boys think he has been turned into a frog.  Everett pushes them on.<br />  After the encounter with the three sirens they run into a one eyed bible sales man.  Big Ted tricks them into going out into the woods for lunch.  Then he kills the frog that is Pete, beats up Nelson and Everett  and then robs them.  This is a close parallel to the encounter with the Cyclops in the Odyssey.  After several more adventures they meet the Cyclopes again.  This time they defeat him.  First they attempt to spear his eye with a rebel flag.  But in the end they  land a fiery cross on top of him.<br />  There is an encounter with a suitor in the later half of the movie.  This time Everett is not the strong one and he gets his but kicked.  He has to learn that an all out attack is hopeless.  So Everett disguises himself and his buddies to sneak into a political rally and see Everett's wife.  The real reason he escaped from jail.  You find out that there is not treasure.  Everett just said that to get his chain boys to leave with him.  His wife is about to get remarried and he will do anything to stop it.  In the end, the boys get a pardon, the get new jobs, and Everett gets the girl.<br />  As for an evaluation.  I do not like George Clooney.  I think he is an arrogant actor that always seams oily.  As such this tainted my perception of the movie.  But I didn't like it just for Clooney's miserable performance.  No I didn't like it because of all the Yodeling.  I did not care for the time period or the jandra this movie was designed for.  The constant caterwauling was not music.  It was noise.  As such I could not get intothe main part of the story.  Their concept that music can save ones soul.<br />  I am also nit picker when it comes to period concepts in films.  As such I was irritated that a rebel flag was used for the KKK, as their symbol, in the film.  The actual rebel flag was not adopted by the clan until the end of the second world war.  As such it should not have been used at all.  Now IK must say that I thought that their portrayal of the country store was accurate.  It wasn't until the advent of the super market that customers could actually get products themselves off of the shelves.  You needed an attendant.  This was a nice vintage touch.<br />  This is a modern rendition of the Odyssey.  However, except for a few obvious parts, the sirens and the Cyclops, I couldn't make the connection.  If you can compare O Brother Where Art Thou to The Odyssey then by all means you can compare What Dreams May Come to Dante's Inferno .Like I have stated it was a stretch.  Also I just felt the acting was lack luster and the plot was forced.  All types of little things kept happening to the convicts that pushed them along in the right direction and rewarded them.  These are prisoners.  It is hard to sympathize with them.  Yes you learn that they did their crimes for good causes, but the fact of the matter is the movie was glorifying the prisoner.  This upset me.  We have enough problems now a days without some idiot getting an idea that it is okay to be like baby face nelson and go out in a criminal ball of glory.  Morally I was opposed to this.<br />  As for the DVD the features were lacking.  I'm used to tons of extras and this DVD had little to offer.  For $15.00 I expect more for my money.  All in all I was extremely disappointed in both the film and the DVD.  I'm glad I only spent $2.62 to rent it.  Even then I felt cheated.<br /><br />Safe journey:<br /><br />Davidt into the main part of the story.  Their concept that music can save ones soul.

1402545355|5.0|Although I am an avid reader, I occasionally purchase books on CD for those unavoidable long drives.  I absolutely fell in love with the story and with the voice of the reader, Lisette LeCat.  I took the CDs into the house, listened to them every spare moment, and then rushed out to buy the next in the series, Tears of the Giraffe.   <br /> <br />The story and characters are wonderful.  Ms. LeCat's supple and expressive voice makes them even more irresistable.  By all means, read the books if that's what you prefer, but in this case, listening is better.
0060278250|5.0|I read Sabriel in a weeks time... <br /> <br />I read Lireal in three days... <br /> <br />I read Abhorsen in two days... <br /> <br />Nix's books always do this to me. His style is hard to ignore, and his creativity, unsurpassed- at least that's what I think. <br />His latest book was no different. With its heart-pumping action, and a great sense of imagry and plot. This book is easily one of my favourites. Garth Nix never fails to go beyond my expectations when writing his final books -though he's only written two so far-. This MUST-READ cliff-hanger is too good to be literature.
B00008MZ0N|1.0|I knew that a big horrible stench of a movie was coming along when I saw the trailors and heard all of the hype surrounding this movie's release and it was even worse than all of the things I anticipated on this pathetic excuse for a movie. All of the negative things that I use to describe bad movies have been used over a quadrillion times but each one of those quadrillion times perfectly sums up what this movie really is: Trash times a quadrillion.<br /><br /> The acting is utterly horrific and it stars two actors from the bottom of the acting barrel. Vin Diesel (who at least was decent in \\"XXX\\"), and Paul Walker, one of the worst actors I've ever seen. The acting by both of them is like watching house paint dry in humid weather.<br /><br /> The so-called plot which is relatively interesting at best centers around a Los Angeles drag racing gang where they steal special equipment meant to beef up the engines of the racing sports cars to make them go faster and a series of hijackings of semis by a gang of drag racers occurs, an undercover police officer is assigned to find out the culprit of the many hijackings that have been occurring.<br /><br /> This movie is a complete farce in every way. The stunts in this movie are extremely unrealistic even without the thinking cap on. I might come off not being educated about cars on here but come on! Is it possible for any civilian vehicles to go that fast in real life? I mean based on the speed of the vehicles in this movie, even NASCAR vehicles go slower than the ones that are driven in this movie! It would be nearly impossible to have steady control on a car going at such speed on a city street due to the uneven surface (speed bumps, potholes, etc.) and also it would also risk a horrible crash because of the immense difficulty of maintaining control over the vehicle.<br /><br /> One of the worst things about this movie that really ticked me off is how it passes women off as nothing more than sex objects for the masses. It really ticks me off that such utter trash like this that makes women into nothing more than objects for men is so popular these days. Is it just me or was this movie meant to be aimed at the bottom of the barrel of civilization. Unless one was totally brain-dead or as dumb as a dead dodo, this movie is insulting to ones intelligence.<br /><br /> So if the truck-drivers are considered the antagonists in this movie, well all I can say is that I really was cheering for the truck driver who was trying to defend himself with a firearm after a failed heist and also how the movie makes cops into bad guys (and these are not corrupt cops either). Hell, why is it alright to make the `good guys' endanger innocent lives by hijacking semis, threatening bystanders, pedestrians, or treating women like objects or filth like this?<br /><br /> To sum everything up on this review, this movie is everything that makes a movie so horrible to watch. It gives out the worst message that glorifies threatening innocent lives, reckless behavior, and forsaking education and intelligence just for the sake of a stupid sports car (in the movie by the way, they look hideous) or a lifetime of regret should a drag race go horribly wrong. This movie, including the \\"Widescreen Tricked Out Edition\\" belongs in the landfill. Avoid like the Ebola virus.he masses.

0064471837|5.0|This book is easily Garth Nix's best. The fast-paced adventure has everything: Adventure, Horror, Drama, Comic relief, Romance...<br /><br />But what I love about this book even more, is the characters, and the plot. Mogget is my favourite, by far, because he's so different. I mean, who could think of a white, talking cat who seems friendly, but deep down wants to kill you? Obviously Nix did. Another great character was Touchstone, who trapped as a figurehead until Sabriel came to the rescue. One Small error I found in Sabriel's character was that she seemed so distant and strange. Not close and connected to the reader, but that's just my thoughts. Other than that, I loved reading this book. It's a MUST READ for fantasy readers.I love it so much, in fact, that I even considered what a Sabriel film would look like. It would be downright awesome. When I heard that a film was being considered, I couldn't contain my excitement. Of course it's still a long road to make this masterpiece of literature into a book, but I feel that someday we'll be seeing it in a theater.
0671027387|4.0|Oh I liked this. Different to Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code but equally enthralling. A major governmental coverup in the highest echelons of US power has our heroine,the daughter of President Zachary Herney's electoral competitor, Senator Sedgewick Sexton, Rachel, flying from the Arctic to Washington to an offshore Discovery Channel ship in an attempt to reveal NASA's greatest hoax ever. In a manner that is exhilarating in a pure thriller novel that twists, turns and races from its opening political battles to its oil rig-eqsue climax. Delta Force missions, surfing the Milne Ice Shelf, 192 million year old meteorites and an explosive sex scandal all serve up a rollicking novel that keeps the reader hooked from the opening page and never lets go.<br /><br />There are several plotlines with one aim - to unseat the President and force NASA to become a privatised company. One one side is Sedgewick Sexton, being secretly funded by the Space Industry companies with Gabrielle Ashe and NASA's adminisrtator, on the other, Rachel Sexton and Michael Tolland who are racing to disprove the alien life theories that are melting out of the ice. A host of great supporting characters with no one seeming to be who they really are and a conspiracy so vast it has the potential to unseat a President this is one thriller you can't put down.<br /><br />Republished on the back of the author's enormous success with the Da Vinci Code, this early novel shows all the hallmarks of great techno-thriller writing that Dan Brown has now shown. The writing style is not quite a fluid as recent novels, but that is to be expected. What is evident is that the author clearly has the ability to writes a novel that hooks the reader and leaves you wanting more...
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|If you listen to the Devils Night album its about 100x better than this album. This album isnt rap, its pop. D12 is supposibly a \\"band\\" now which their not. They used to be a rap group now their a pop band. There is no goods songs on this album. The only song decent on it is 40Oz. The only song that sounds anything like they used to is keep talking the bonus track. The album is crap and i would highly recommend listening to clips of the songs before u buy it. If you like what u hear then u like pop, and not rap. And probably shouldnt browse in the rap section anymore. All this is, is black people singing pop, so they say its rap. This album sucks period
B000000OUJ|5.0|3 Steps: <br />1 Buy this disc <br />2 Listen to it <br />3 be amazed by GZA's wordplay and similes, deeper meaning, be in awe of RZA's dark beats that exude darkness and griminess, think about the albums mythology, and let it ride into your mind and stimulate. <br />4 after finished with the album listening, you will be thinking about what it said, \\"THE RZA, PHAT TRACKS ON A DISC, RIZZA RAZA RIZZA RAZA SHARP\\" is what i remember the most. \\"FLOW LIKE THE BLOOD ON A MURDER SCENE\\" or maybe \\"PICTURE BLOODBATHS IN ELEVATOR SHAFTS\\" let the endless repetition of the itch to listen to the album again bother you until you are able to listen again. <br />5. repeat steps 2 through 4 and maybe even 1 if you lose your disc.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|NOTE: If you liked 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly'; or 'The Searchers' or 'The Magnificent Seven' - you probably won't enjoy this film.  Nonetheless, even if you have the greatest satelite/cable/TiVo system in the world this MUST be a staple in your DVD library.   <br /> <br />OUATITW (Once Upon A Time In The West) isn't so much a western, as how the Old West was perceived by Italian filmmakers.  You have to prepare yourself for extremely little dialogue, booming sound effects and the somber (albeit brilliant) muscial score.  Let's put this another way folks, OUATITW played EVERY DAY for over 4 years(!) at a movie house in Paris, France - so it was kinda their version of the 'Rocky Horror Picture Show.' <br /> <br />There are dozens of reviews on this (that are far too long),  Simply put - if you find yourself with 3 hours to spare on an overcast Sunday afternoon, treat yourself to this masterpiece.  You MUST experience it in widescreen, you MUST experience it in stereo.  I repeat, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />FURTHER NOTE:  It sells for less than 10 bucks (brand new!) now, its worth every nickel. <br /> <br /> <br />

0312319517|2.0|The Odessa File.  Judging from \\"Avenger,\\" those days are long gone.  Forsyth needs to a) get an editor; b) begin to care about his readers again; c) rediscover a sense of pride in his craft.<br /><br />The narrative never attains any flow, which sharply reduces the level of suspense of this action-packed, yet dull novel.  One problem is that Forsyth seems to think that every character must be introduced with a full-length birth-to-current biography.  That's OK, if you're 15 years old and are just starting out writing, but points to the degeneration of Forsyth's skills.<br /><br />\\"Avenger\\" is a wildly-implausible, sloppy piece of garbage.
B00008YLV2|4.0|If you have a region-free player, rather consider buying the South Korean superbit deluxe edition.  Instead of the commentaries on disc 1, you get fabulous DTS sound. Discs 2 & 3 are identical to this edition but you get a fourth disc with the South Korean edition, being the soundtrack on CD. <br /> <br />The movie itself rates 5 stars.
0425098389|5.0|Although he also wrote several novels featuring the world's greatest fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, it was especially in his short stories that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle perfected the Holmes formula.  And of the five collections of Holmes short stories (about a dozen in each collection), \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" (published in 1892) was the first and is easily the most popular and best of the five. It contains all except one of the five all-time most popular short stories in the Sherlock Holmes canon (A Scandal in Bohemia, The Red-headed League, The Blue Carbuncle, and The Speckled Band), as well as some other gems like The Five Orange Pips.  For newcomers to Holmes, this there is no better place to start than with the dozen stories that comprise \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\".  And for long-time fans, these are old favorites worth reading again and again.<br /><br />Here's a list of the stories in this collection (with the better stories marked with stars):<br /><br />***A Scandal in Bohemia, 1891 - The very first and one of the top five Sherlock Holmes short stories.  After some brilliant detective work involving disguises and acting, Holmes is outwitted by the woman Irene Adler in his quest to help the hereditary king of Bohemia regain a scandalous photograph from her.<br /><br />***The Red-headed League, 1891 - Generally regarded as all-time second best Sherlock Holmes story, this bizarre tale features a pawnbroker who is paid money to join the mysterious Red-Headed League and copy out Encyclopedia Britannica, as part of an ingenious scheme to rob a bank.<br /><br />A Case of Identity, 1891 - Holmes solves the mystery of Mary Sutherland's fiance who disappears on the morning of his wedding, unmasking it as scheme hatched by her greedy step-father.<br /><br />The Boscombe Valley Mystery, 1891 - Charles McCarthy's son seems the obvious murderer of his father after a violent quarrel, so it is up to Holmes to show that the murder has its real roots in the Australian past of the dead man and his landlord.<br /><br />**The Five Orange Pips, 1891 - One of Doyle's personal favorites, this tale recounts the death of two men, both preceded by the arrival of five mysterious orange pips.  In one of his few failures, Holmes connects the events to the Ku Klux Klan, but not soon enough to prevent another death.<br /><br />*The Man with the Twisted Lip, 1891 - A baffling mystery about Mr. Neville St. Clair who disappears from a room into thin air, and a professional beggar who is the suspected murderer.<br /><br />***The Blue Carbuncle, 1892 - Another favorite all-time top 5 Holmes story, as Holmes unravels how a blue diamond ended up inside the goose intended for Mr. Henry Baker's Christmas dinner.<br /><br />***The Speckled Band, 1892 - Universally regarded as the most popular short story in the Sherlock Holmes canon, and easily one of the more suspenseful and chilling.  The engaged Helen Stoner is terrified when she hears the same strange whistling that preceded the death of her twin sister in a locked bedroom shortly before her wedding.

B00005JMUA|4.0|\\"Kill Bill Vol. 2\\" is the second half of a VERY long but VERY good movie by `cult' director Quentin Tarantino. Its distributor, fearing audiences would not sit through a movie over three hours long, decided that it be released in two parts. How this effected boxoffice I do not know. I do know that it is best viewed in its entirety. Movies running this long are rare but hardly without precedent. In 1939 MGM was faced with a similar problem with \\"Gone With the Wind\\", which clocked in at over 3 and  hours. Initially, the studio planned to release the movie in two parts. Ultimately, a decision was reached to release it in the long format, albeit with an intermission. This proved to be a brilliant plan, and the movie went on to become the highest grossing movie of all time.  <br /> <br />In volume 2, The Bride [Uma Thurman] continues to exact her revenge. She continues to hunt down those who will lead her to \\"Bill\\", the man who mastermind the mass murder that occurred at her wedding.  <br /> <br />Tarantino strikes me as a `child-like' director, a boy who is mesmerized by all things related to movies. I mean this in a positive way. He sees things in a way a `child' would see them. So, perhaps, did Orseon Welles, or Mozart, for that matter. Vision is not a thing defined by age. <br />
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather Part 1. <br />The best of the trilogy, its got a great performance from Brando and most of the other guys, its got all the great mob action like the horse head and sleeping with the fishes and a bunch of hits, its got drama a very sad ending, and its definetly the best mafia movie ever, it will never be surpassed. <br />Part 2. <br />My least favortie, but still a very good movie.  It focuses too much on politics, and not enough on the family and the business.  The most interesting parts are the flashbacks with Vito, played by De Niro, all the good mob stuff happens in these parts, everything with Michael is politics this and politics that and im gonna kill my brother whcih was sad but necessary.  Part 1 is the best this one is actually the worst in the trilogy in my opinion. <br />Part 3. <br />Better then part 2, not as good as part 1.  A more dramatic story then part 2 with lots of cool hits, and a sad ending, in fact most of this movies is sad, lots of bad things happen.  It sums up everything very well, and overall is the second best movie of the trilogy. <br />This trilogy is one of the best ever, Part 1 is the best, but the other 2 are still better then any other mafia movie, if you enjoy mafia movies and you dont have this you will wake up with a present from me, or you wont wake up at all.  10 out of a 10.
B000002C2E|4.0|This was one of the first CD's I listened to when I was first exploring Dylan's music, and it was very difficult to get through. I blame mostly myself, but at the time, the music felt too slow ('too much of a drag,' I would've said), and I couldn't warm myself to Dylan's voice. If you only know Dylan through his 60's work and, say, \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" I can say from personal experience, hearing his 90's-era voice can be a challenge. It's a credit to Dylan's phrasing that he makes it work, but to someone green on Dylan, it will be an acquired taste. <br /> <br />Once you get used to the ragged, raspy qualities of his voice, everything starts to fall into place: you learn to appreciate the phrasing, the words, and then the soundscape. This is a very low-key, late night album, and in the right mood and setting, this album will sound incredibly evocative. There's a feeling of restlessness, dejection, cynicism, and desperation that runs through the songs, and under most circumstances, that would be a recipe for disaster, but Dylan makes wonderful music out of these dark, moody colors. I've heard some say the album reflects his feeling of mortality, but I think that's just a minor theme here. Most of the songs are sung like a man who's become detached, and being completely aware of this yet unable to do anything about it. On \\"Highlands,\\" the epic closer, he seems to face up to the fact that he may not 'get it' anymore, feeling out-of-touch, and his muse possibly drying up. Later efforts like \\"Love & Theft\\" dispute this. but through the course of this album, it's very compelling to hear Dylan take stock of himself in this way. <br /> <br />These songs didn't jump out at first, these are low-key songs that take time to really love, and upon repeated listening, you can understand why this CD could be considered a masterpiece. Better than the released versions of \\"Infidels\\" and \\"Oh Mercy,\\" it really was a resurgence this time around. Lanois's production, much darker and moodier than the one he applied to \\"Oh Mercy,\\" seems like a natural fit for these songs, as well. If there's anything here that breaks the spell, it's \\"Make You Feel My Love,\\" which sounds so lyrically out of place and so sappy, you'd wish Dylan had replaced it with \\"Girl From The Red River Shore,\\" which has yet to see the light of day. <br /> <br />Regardless, there are plenty of highlights: \\"Love Sick,\\" \\"Standing In The Doorway,\\" \\"Tryin' To Get To Heaven,\\" and \\"Not Dark Yet\\" are the best. \\"Cold Irons Bound\\" drags on a bit, and Dylan would later do it justice with another band on the \\"Masked & Anonymous\\" soundtrack - that version is a classic. The only other duff track besides \\"Make You Feel My Love\\" is \\"Highlands.\\" 16 minutes long, the first and last parts of the song aren't bad. It's the six minutes in between that bog it down, the awkward story about a waitress who forces the narrator to display his art when he just wants a meal, only to reject his work, and then accuses him of being out-of-touch with women's writing. Pretty sly, if you know Dylan, you know where he's getting at, which is why I feel bad for dismissing it, but the verses are just too clumsy. Some fans really love it the song just for that part, though, so take that into consideration. <br /> <br />A mid-priced disc, it's definitely worth the price. Just give it time to grow on you.
B000000YG5|5.0|A great CD. Sonny Rollins at his best. Probably one of the best sax players ever. A great CD with great drum, bass, and piano solos along with the amazing Tenor solos. Highly recommend it.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|I saw this movie on premiere night, and it was, by far, the most amazing movie of the three!  I loved the computer graphics, and Steve Kloves's screenplay was pretty close to the book.  He left some parts out, or they might just be deleted scenes.  But, overall, I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!!!  Sirius Black was awesome, and Dan Radcliffe portrayed Harry incredibly well! I saw this movie a total of four times in the theater, and I loved it more each time!
0553328255|5.0|These two volumes contain the complete collection of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's adventures of the world's most famous super sleuth, Sherlock Holmes.  For any mystery reader, the Sherlock Holmes stories are must-have classics, with a combination of excellent characterization and ruthless logic coming together in the enigmatic person of Holmes himself.  Watson's analysis of Holmes is insightful: \\"Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero...Botany variable, geology profound as regards the mudstains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco.\\"  What marks Holmes is his ability to perceive the extraordinary in the ordinary.  To quote the man himself:  \\"Life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent ... there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace ...  The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home ... There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.\\"  Like Watson, we readers are frequently amazed at the logical deductions he produces, as Watson humbly confesses to Holmes, \\"When I hear you give your reasons, the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process.\\" Watson is often perplexed as we are: \\"I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes.  Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque.\\"  But perhaps what we enjoy most is the moment when Holmes sits in his chair to unravel the mystery for us.<br /><br />Altogether Doyle wrote four novel-length books featuring Holmes: \\"A Study in Scarlet\\"; \\"The Sign of Four\\"; \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\"; and \\"The Valley of Fear\\".  But the greatest ever fictional detective especially acquired his legendary status through the 56 short stories starring Holmes, in which Doyle perfected the Holmes formula.  Each story is written from the perspective of Holmes' side-kick, Dr. Watson, and can be read independently.  It's in these short stories that Doyle excels.<br /><br />Originally written as five separate collections of about a dozen stories each, the best and most popular collection is the first, \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" (1892), which contains top classics like \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", \\"The Red-headed League\\", \\"The Five Orange Pips\\", \\"The Blue Carbuncle\\", and the story universally regarded as the most popular short story in the entire Sherlock Holmes canon, \\"The Speckled Band\\".  Although not quite as popular, the second and third collections are still very good.  \\"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\\" (1893) has excellent stories like \\"Silver Blaze\\", \\"The Stock-broker's Clerk\\", and \\"The Musgrave Ritual\\".  \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\" (1905) is arguably even better, including favorites like \\"The Empty House\\", \\"The Dancing Men\\", \\"The Prioriy School\\", and \\"The Six Napoleons\\". The last two collections, \\"His Last Bow\\" (1917) and \\"The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes\\" (1927), did not quite live up to the same standards as their predecessors, but are still worth reading.<br /><br />The good news is that in these two volumes published by Bantam Classics you get the works - all the stories Doyle ever wrote about Holmes.  As a reader who enjoys a good mystery story, this remains one of my favourites, and with over 1500 pages of reading, is a worthy addition to any personal library!  Although written in the early 20th century, Holmes' incredible deductions and brilliant detective work is timeless, and will continue to amaze and entertain readers well into the 21st century.<br /><br />- GODLY GADFLYe 21st century.<br /><br />- GODLY GADFLY
B00000JLWW|4.0|From a guys point of view this is still a very good movie, although yes it definetly is one of the biggest chick flicks.  I with held the 5th star because it focuses a little too much on the love crapola and very little on the ship going down and why.  But this is also a movie about survival and in that guys will find it to be a very good movie.  The visuals of the ship and it going down are incredible, INCREDIBLE, some of the best visuals ever are in this movie, it is only surpassed by LOTR in that area.  Its quite long and could have been about a half an hour shorter, they could have taken out some of the scenes when people first get on the boat and some of the love scenes.  Leo and Kate give good performances.  I give it a 8 out of a 10.  Its definetly a good movie, but chicks would probably be the only ones who would watch it over and over.
006072448X|1.0|Lionel Shriver, We Need to Talk About Kevin (Counterpoint, 2003)<br /><br />At various times over the years, I have mentioned the fifty-page rule. That rule is that you give a book fifty pages to get better. If it's still horrible after fifty pages, throw it against the wall, let it slide behind the couch to feed the dustbunnies (cf. last week's review of Museum), and start something else. I used to be the kind of person who would never let a book go until I'd strangled on every last word, so starting to use the fifty-page rule for truly bad novels seven or eight years ago was profoundly liberating. And, really, no matter how bad a book has been, and I've come across some stinkers (cf. last week's review of Museum), I've always held to that rule. If I give a book zero stars, with a few exceptions that truly transcend badness that I actually did finish (cf. review from a while ago of the worst book ever written, Sue Doro's Heart, Home, and Hard Hats), you can rest assured I've choked down fifty pages of it. Until now.<br /><br />Lionel Shriver's writing style (or her main character; the difference, for the purposes of this discussion, is nil) in We Need to Talk About Kevin is so self-obsessed, self-pitying, whining, sickening, and all-around loathsome I could not, under any circumstances, make myself continue after page twenty-four. Were it not a library book, I'd have burned it rather than feed the dustbunnies this possibly lethal dreck. Now, granted, having only made it to page twenty-four, I will admit that it's entirely possible the book does get better. Two things, however, tell me this is not the case. The first is that, while sometimes books bog down in setup before they get to the plot, then take off (the most famous recent example being Neal Stephenson's wonderful Snow Crash), when the problem with a book is the author's actual writing style, I have yet to come across a case where the book gets better. The second is that other reviews of the book, at least those not written by either people who gush over it (and I have little doubt that those capable of ignoring an author's writing style in favor of the plot would get a lot out of this; I just don't understand how a reader can ignore writing style) or those who give every book a five-star review voice much the same complaint. And these are people who forced themselves all the way through, for the most part. Some choice snippets from others include \\"...Eva is the kind of person who... invites being taken down a peg or two...,\\" \\"I just could not like the protagonist... at all,\\" and a subject line reading \\"well written, but has loathsome protagonist.\\" Indeed. Not normally a dustbunny-filling problem, except that this is an epistolary novel. The protagonist's voice is the only one you hear. Three hundred plus long, whining, self-pitying, self-obsessed, annoying pages. Do you have a friend who does nothing but whine and complain about how hard life is? Imagine getting a three-hundred-page typed single-spaced letter from said friend. Would you read it, or skim the first few pages to get the gist, then toss the rest into the trash? Now imagine the letter came from a stranger. Same question.<br /><br />I suggest you apply the same treatment to We Need to Talk About Kevin.

B00005KFUM|5.0|I guiltily admit to seeing Origin floating around and blowing it off for no good reason. Time is Running Out caught my attention and Blackout convinced me. So, yes, my exposure to Origin was working backwards. Seeing how my real Muse love is the quiet Blackout (see Absolution), Origin was a bit hard to swallow. But after arriving to the end of the seven or eight minutes of Citizen Erased I was sold. Repeated listens convinced me this is a great album, some fine rock. The whole thing works well.
B00028HBKM|4.0|With all of the debate of violence aside I was really impressed by the way Mel Gibson stuck almost entirely with the scriptures. Too many times we have endured the pain of too much so-called poetic license. The motion picture industry has allowed the dilusion of too many bible epics in that we would rather have a profit than a true experience. I enjoyed the movie and the violence may or may not be to your liking, but at the time that Jesus was scourged and killed he probabibly endured that much and more.
B00006879E|4.0|Led by the #1 single This Love, and the #3 hit Harder To Breathe, Maroon 5's Songs About Jane could run off a long string of Top 10 hits. This entire disc is chock full of rich, soulful pieces that could dominate the charts for quite some time.<br /><br />  It's rare to hear a band with this kind of talent, doing what comes naturally. This is a band with a great singer that has good range and style, and a sense of soul. It's this sense of soul that dominates the sound here, and makes this record a real winner. With songs like The Sun and Sunday Morning, we get treated to a suave, moody strut that's polished and pristine; at other times, we're served some light funk, or a tender crooning. This record offers an excellent variety of styles. The last act to offer a sound such as this was the impeccable Jamiroquai, and Maroon 5 is just as good here.<br /><br />  When the record kicks off with Harder To Breathe, the band vaults themselves right in your face. With a confrontational vocal track, and an unbelievable groove from the rhythm section of drummer Ryan Dusick and bassist Mickey Madden, one might even be reminded of Rage Against The Machine. Don't get me wrong, the track is nowhere near as heavy as any of the Rage stuff, but it has that same \\"heavy groove thang\\". Unfortunately, they never really return to anything with such a heavy groove. Instead, they write great melodies, that have infectious hooks, with infallible poise. Already riding the #1 success of This Love, it should be just a matter of time before they enjoy the success of radio-ready songs like She Will Be Loved, Must Get Out or Sunday Morning. All of these songs have that instant likeability factor. Must Get Out and Sunday Morning are bright and cheerful, with sing along choruses that are perfect for summer radio play; and She Will Be Loved is just a flawless ballad that sticks like glue. After just one listen, you prepare yourself to be reminded of the hook each and every minute for the rest of the day. That's what Top 40 radio is all about. Everything on this record has a sense of integrity and purity about it also. You get the feeling that this is a group of accomplished musicians that have fostered a passion for the old soul classics of artists like Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye, because their similarities come naturally and unforced. Maroon 5 is a band that is comfortable with their approach to the modern soul sound. Listening to this record, many similarities and influences can be heard. Tangled, and Sweetest Goodbye display a Stevie Wonder sound in some ways; She Will Be Loved, The Sun and Must Get Out have Terence Trent D'Arby tinges; and, Shiver and Not Coming Home have some Prince tendencies. While you hear all of these influences, you are at all times aware of the fact that Maroon 5 is doing what comes naturally to them, and the similarities sound totally unintentional. This is a band with loads of talent, that has no need to be someone else. They sound just fine being themselves.<br /><br />  Well, ...this is the fun part. I have to give you reasons why this isn't a 10. The only thing I can say is, I wish there were a few more heavy groovers like \\"Harder To Breathe\\". When they thump and groove heavy, they do it really well. I'd love to hear a bit more of it. I can also say that some small brass parts may have made a few tracks \\"pop\\" a bit more. Some soulful background vocals, to compliment the fantastic lead parts, may have enhanced their sound, also. But this is really nit-picking. This is a great record.<br /><br />OVERALL RATING:  8<br /><br />For more Dr. Music reviews, visit [...]he day. That's what Top 40 radio is all about.

B000286RKW|5.0|One of Scorcese's best, better then casino, about as good as gangs of new york.  Its funny, its dramatic, its got good mob action, its got great performances, its  got a good story, what more could you want.  Nothing this movie has it all, except the horse head, o well.  9 out of a 10.
B00009W0U4|5.0|Another brilliant risk in cinema that worked and worked well (maybe too well).  With so much Hollywood crap regurgitating onto the screen,  this was a shocking (yet welcome)  change. <br />   I'm not going to comment on the two imfamous scenes (except to say that the director succeeded in pulling them off and making us think)  rather I want to focus on the fact that movies are a changin' and people can't expect fairy tales all their lives.  Irreversible pushes the boundaries of adult content and simulated violence,  but in no way is this film exploitation fare.  The director (in reverse)  takes us through hell and back,  using amazing erratic (and sometimes dizzying)  camera work,  underscored by a brilliant,  repetitious phat bassline,  and as we endure the journey with the camera,  everything slowly calms down (camera,  music score changes,  characters).  I have never seen anything like it and it is by far the most original way I've seen a movie shot before,  and thats the foundation of a harrowingly real experience of degradation and basic human emotion.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I'm not going to rehash what's been said before about Columbus's \\"camera with roots\\" versus Cuaron's \\"camera with wings.\\"  Incidentally, people who thought there was less magic in PoA than the previous two weren't paying attention.  It would never occur to Columbus to put a special effects shot anywhere but center frame.  Cuaron gilds his world with magic; Columbus beats you over the head with it. <br /> <br />What I really don't understand, though, is this outcry for more Quidditch.  I am a huge fan of the books, but I will gladly admit that Quidditch is simply the stupidest sport ever conceived.  Capturing the Snitch is worth so many points that everything that goes on beforehand is meaningless.  In five books and countless Quidditch matches, only once has the pre-Snitch score mattered, and all I took away from that was that the Romanian Qudditch team is really, really bad. <br /> <br />I'd say it's like playing a game of soccer where, at the end of two hours of intense competition, the referree flips a coin to decide the winner, but it's WORSE than that.  It's more like a soccer game where one team is being BLOWN AWAY 14-0, but then some guy from the losing team's backfield who hasn't been paying much attention to the rest of the game notices a shiny quarter sticking out of the mud at his feet, and scores 15 goals for picking it up.  Oh, and is carried off the field on everyone's shoulders and declared a HERO for his excellent... um... eyesight. <br /> <br />Less Qudditch is a good thing if you're not logically challenged.
B0001MDP36|5.0|I would imagine that top calibur producers and actors read these comments.  Nevertheless I don't really appreciate too many movies, because there really aren't very many out there, in my opinion.  Regardless this movie tops my list.  The cinematography is nothing short of amazing and the subject matter is seemingly flawless.  I don't like fictions too much, but this movie is something of a carbon copy of reality.<br /><br />As a college history major, it is hard to imagine what life was like during the 19th century, how people suffered, how they ate and managed their lives.  This movie depicts these issues without sensationalizing for reviews.<br /><br />Also, this movie illustrates human morality.  This movie is like a seminar on such issues as justice, sexuality, war and society in general.  Is there such a thing as ultimate right and wrong?  In a nutshell, what this movie does is depict that human beings are ultimately flawed and that in order to transcend this reality one has to work and struggle very, very hard in life to even achieve the simplest goal.<br /><br />I would like to write more but I am afraid of digressing on boring tangents.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|This movie is talked about by alot of rappers, because they think their cool trying be tough and some actually think Al is cuban.  In truth this movie is not about who is the baddest, who does the most drugs, and kills the most people, this is a real movie a crime drama directed by a good director.  Its got one hell of a performance by Al, who by the way is Italian, and nobody else can deliver the line \\"say hello to my little friend\\" like he can.  Its got some good gangster action, the chainsaw scene and the last shootout.  Its got a good story, its got drama, its got some humor, and some pretty good cinematography like in the riot.  Overall is a very good movie, not one of the best, but its definetly an entertaining experience, i give it a 9 out of a 10.  I would just like to say that rap is terrible and soon i hope it will be gone it is ruining the music industry, and anyone who only likes this movie because rappers think its the hot good needs to be shot.

All in all great CD!
B000002TP7|4.0|\\"Ill Communication\\" is basically \\"Check Your Head 2: Electric Boogalou\\". It follows the same template of \\"Check Your Head\\": live funk and jazz songs, a few hardcore ditties, a little of the Biz and some hip-hop songs thrown in for good measure. And though its never as exhilarating as its predescor, its never a bad record. <br />This time around, there are more rap songs, which is good because they rarely did 'em better. \\"Sure Shot\\", \\"Root Down\\", \\"Get It Togather\\", faturing a funny freestyle from A Tribe Called Quest's Q-Tip, are all funky, with some of the Beastie's best rhymes(best: MCA \\"I gotta say a little something that's long overdue/This disrespecting woman has got to be through/ To all the mothers, and the sisters and the wives anf friends/ I wanna offer my love and respect to the end\\". Kind of an interesting contrast to \\"Girls\\", but everyone's gotta grow up, right?) <br />This records \\"Gratitude\\", \\"Sabotage\\" is one of the groups best songs, a mix of the instrumentals that makes up the bulk of the album, set to a hip-hop beat with a bit of the hardcore aggression that occasionally pops up. <br />And those hardcore songs? Well, you have a skip button, don't you? <br />\\"Ill Communication\\" may not break new ground, but that's not to say that it isn't good. It is. Its a perfect compliment to \\"Check Your Head\\".
B000065TQR|2.0|Sorry, all, but this doesn't deserve the accolades it gets.  If you're really into the hippy-dippy 60's, the psychedlic movement (whoa, man... far out...), this is probably good stuff.  But it's 60's psych-lite, at least from what I could hear.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  There was much better psych out by this time.
B000001IQH|5.0|What is left to say about this ablum, that hasn't been said. ....And out come the wolves is one of the best punk albums out there and is the best punk album of the 90's.  If this doesn't convience you to at-least check this album out, I don't know what will.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet - Firefly rocks, Fox sucks.  I hope there is a very special level of hell reserved for Fox executives who dump brilliant shows such as Firefly in favor of the absolute white trash programming that plagues the network.  And when I hear that they didn't even let the creators air the episodes in the intended order I wanted to stab a Fox executive in the eye with a fork.  They have some seriously dumb people making decisions at that black hole of television programming called Fox. <br /> <br />More importantly than my hate for Fox is my love for Firefly - I just picked up the DVD set on a whim, looking for some good sci-fi, and was blown away by how amazing this show was in it's FIRST 14 EPISODES ALONE.  This show would have been huge had it been given a chance.  The production values are top notch (a rarity for sci-fi considering the costs involved), the writing is across the board from hilarious to sincerely dramatic, and the cast was PERFECTLY chosen.  Awesome cast, they really seal the deal and make you care about the characters. <br /> <br />Can't wait for the movie and even better, can't wait for Joss Whedon to bring Firefly back to it's true home - television.  I hope he does whatever it takes to pry the rights from Fox and goes somewhere a little more foward-thinking (HBO!).  Buy Firefly, but it NOW.
B0002858YS|4.0|2004 has been a gracious one for Rock, many new bands exploding on to the scene, and many cult favorites making their major label debuts have led to a strong year.  Of those afformentioned new bands are the Killers, one of the most refreshing bands to come about in quite sometime.  Their unique mix of 80's new wave and 90's alternative is neither over nor under done, but just right.  \\"Hot Fuss\\" really delievers in a big way, from start to finish it has the potential to be a future classic.  While nothing groundbreaking, it's arguably one of the better albums to come out in the past few years.  If you're sick of everything MTV spoon feeds to the masses, and tired of bland Indie Rock, try this one on for size.
B000002ADT|5.0|Man.. I can't believe that I still visit people's homes and this album isn't in everyone's collection. And other Miles fans talk about 'Sketches of Spain', but for me, KOB is the best. Each song is so classic and is played with so much care... it's like listening to magic take place in front of your face. All tracks were laid out briefly by Miles and the crew before being recorded once in order to capture the human aspects of the playing (I think that maybe one or two songs were laid down twice...but you get the idea, no fooling around with laying a track 10 times over).  <br /> Don't bother to listen to this album if you aren't going to take it seriously though. You owe it to your ears.
630542828X|4.0|This is one of those typical movies in which the greedy lawyer grows a conscience and starts out on a quest to defend the less privileged. But, even though the subject is not new, the way in which the story is presented and the performances by John Travolta, and especially Robert Duvall, make this a pretty good production anyhow.<br /><br />Travolta plays Jan Schlichtmann, a successful lawyer that measures everything in terms of money, including the life of others. For example, the perfect victim / client for him is a white male professional in his forties, while the one that has the least worth is no other than a child! Jan is one of Boston's most eligible bachelors and is having a ball; he believes he is above everyone else and does not care about mundane events or tragedies that other people may suffer. One day though, he receives a call from a client while he is on a radio show on air, and has no other option but to follow through on the case; at least so as to look a little better in the public eye.<br /><br />The case involves kids getting sick, and some dying, due to water wells contaminated with ethylene. Jan knows that since the victims are kids there is no real money in the case, so he is reluctant to take it. But when he is leaving town something catches his eye; the small tannery believed to be the culprit is owned by a huge company with various subsidiary companies, including the producer of Tropicana. From then on, we get to watch a typical David versus Goliath fight, which involves the lawyer with his limited team and funds and the huge corporation with unlimited resources and a very clever lawyer heading its case (Duvall).<br /><br />The film does a great job in presenting the feelings and priorities of those injured by the negligence of a corporation. Often people think that money is everything in a civil trial, but this example shows that that is not always the case. Some of the characters evolve greatly during the story, understanding what is really important and what is superficial. For these reasons, the movie deserves an above average rating.is really important and what is superficial. For these reasons, the movie deserves an above average rating. <br />
B00005JMEW|5.0|Genius, period!  Artistic.  Wait until you see the next up coming movie in theather on Aug 17, 2004 called \\"HERO - Jet Li\\"  If you like \\"Kill Bill\\"... then \\"HERO\\" is going to blow your mind away!
B000021Y77|4.0|'Run Lola Run' is not only entertaining, but also brings up questions about our current assumption that time is linear, that what we do stays in the past. <br /> <br />After the three scenes depicting the butterfly effect, I was left to wonder, what if time really is circular? What if the things that we do today have a dramatic impact on someone else's tomorrow? Can there be multiple realities ocurring at one time, and when coinciding resulting in a form of de ja vu? <br /> <br />'Run Lola Run' was very interesting, and is a great movie if you're in a philosophical mood!
B00008J4P5|2.0|I just don't get it. Yeah, the album is raw and it's ok... but all of the attention that the White Stripes are getting, for me, is a bit undeserved. I think that I bought this album expecting a timeless album from all of the hype. Now I listen to it after about 4 listenings ... and to be honest... it's just a bit tired.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|This album is a HUGE disappointment, mostly due to the fact that this is more of a dance record rather than a pop album. In case you can't tell, I loathe dance music. <br /> <br />I liked some of Britney's earlier stuff. Her catchy pop numbers like \\"Oops! I Did it Again\\" and her ballads like \\"Sometimes.\\" Now Britney takes a turn from all of that to show everyone that she's not a girl anymore. Now she's a woman. But I just don't see that with her overplayed publicity stunts and her wearing revealing clothes. To me, it seems she's more lost than ever (like what rival Christina Aguilera once stated).  <br /> <br />And this album didn't catch my attention like before. Sure, the \\"Toxic\\" video did, but the sound it had... I was like, \\"What the hell is this??\\" I think the strings used in the song aren't needed. The lyrics are good, but I just hate the sound it had. With \\"Me Against the Music,\\" I can't even tell if Britney is actually singing since her voice is basically hidden by the wonderous use of technology these days... then again, it sounds like that throughout her whole album. \\"Touch of My Hand\\" is a lame attempt at trying to provocative like or more than Madonna. <br /> <br />The two songs I actually like here are \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Breathe On Me.\\" \\"Everytime\\" is a great ballad and probably the best song here. \\"Breathe On Me\\" is definately the sexiest song here, even more so than the horrid \\"Touch Of My Hand.\\" And these two songs are the reason for my 2 star rating. Everything else here are just... horrible. <br /> <br />If Britney wants to be taken seriously or wants to be a woman, then she needs to ditch her stripper-like appearances. She could've taken a route like Mandy Moore (who seems more of a woman than Britney... and she's YOUNGER!), but then again, it wouldn't be herself. Well, Britney... I think you'll NEVER be taken seriously. And this is by far one of the worst albums I've heard recently.
B00028HBKC|4.0|I truely believe having this film released and viewed and talked about by thousands of people was a goal set out by our Lord and no matter how bloody and disgusted some people may be by the film, the message was clear.  Jesus died for all of us so that we could have a relationship with the Lord!  Yes there will be critics that say this film wasnt as clear about Jesus's life as some other films, which is true, but it wasnt meant to.  It was meant to show people, assuming they probably knew the story of Christ, Jesus's last few hours.  As a \\"movie\\" I wouldnt necessarily want to see it again and again just because it IS very violent and I personally cannot watch it without not feeling too well.  But the fact that it is out in the public eye and may very well bring MANY people to Christ makes it a wonderful tool.
B000068PQ0|5.0|I didn't listen to this album for a while after I bought it. I read a couple of reviews from people who had similar tastes and took a chance. When I got it I was disappointed at first.  <br /> After putting it on a few more times as background music I got used to a few songs... then a few more... then I started to hear it in my head and it was all over. Just took a while. <br />
B00005M989|5.0|And that's exactly what I did with his album - as I do with all my music.  Love Prince, love the 80's and don't care who knocks me for it!  I thought the album was groovy - fun songs, good memories and sounds pretty damn good next to my Marianne Faithfull, Tom Petty and Linkin Park.  Don't try and analyse this stuff too much, just enjoy!
B00001OH7U|5.0|I like Bowie a lot, but I had never really heard this album until recently.  My friend picked it up a few weeks ago and we had it in his car during a week long trip we took.  It is simply incredible.  It inspired me to write a review.  After the first listen I thought it was interesting.  But after the second, I just couldn't get enough of it.  We must have played the album three times a day.  In fact, I wish I were listening to the opening track, \\"Station to Station\\" right now.  This may sound absurd, but it might be the best 10 minute song I've ever heard.  I've been singing it for weeks.  The second track, \\"Golden Years,\\" is excellent too.  The album might reach its peak on the the third and fourth tracks: \\"Word on a Wing,\\" a ballad with some gutsy singing from Bowie, and \\"TVC15,\\" a brilliant sort of dance number.  I really don't know what to call it.  Track five, \\"Stay,' is a good funk-inspired avant-garde piece.  The closing track, \\"Wild is the Wind,\\" is not written by Bowie.  I thought it was pretty noticeable while listening to the album.  The lyrics try a few too many metaphors.  It sounded sort of forced, and Bowie didn't seem as into it.  It still serves as an entertaining closer. <br /> <br />  In closing, I'll repeat that Bowie's singing is amazing; I'll add that the small number of tracks works well, and that Carlos Alomar's guitar playing is phenomenal.  It never steals the spotlight, but is still intense.
B000002U82|5.0|it's just one of those albums that you keep putting back into the CD player. Whether you own other Pink Floyd albums or not.. you will keep coming back to Dark Side eventually. It's too good. <br /> <br />Let's put it this way... if you are reading reviews on this album, you must have heard it was decent from someone with good taste in music. Combine that with the fact that the album still sells like wild fire all over the world. Now go buy it!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|A hauntingly beautiful CD. Sarah's voice continues to amaze. <br />If I am met by an Angel in heaven, her voice will probably sound like this. <br /> <br />Although less edgier than her previous efforts, Sarah, still writes beautiful lyrics and melodies.The songs are personal and filled with emotion.  My favorites on the CD include Train Wreck, Drifting, Answer and Perfect Girl, although I like them all... <br /> <br />Just saw her live, (she sang everything on this entire CD I believe) and it was the most amazing performance by a female vocalist I've ever seen.. You just have to experience her live to appreciate her awesome talents.
B00005JG6Q|4.0|I remember renting this just a while after its major release and it really blew my mind. I had to watch it a few times as I could not follow the story. I just recently bought the DVD and watched it again for the first time in over 10 years and it's still great. I finally understood it also. It does seem a bit dated now, but it still holds its own. Watch it in the original Japanese with subtitles because the American voices sound really corny. It does drag on at times towards the end especially the \\"2001 space odyssey\\" like acid trip which is a little confusing, but fun to watch. The best scene in the movie is when Tetsou is in the military hospital and the other children pay him a visit. The animation is brilliant, such as a glass cup falling to the floor and Tetsou slipping breaking the glass and cutting his foot on the broken shards. OUCH! I can almost feel it! Yes, The animation is that good. There is also some excellent animation and sound effects in the sewer with the speeder bike like machines. I think anyone who watches this movie, whether an animation fan or not, will enjoy it.
079284131X|4.0|I rented this movie and really enjoyed it.  It had a great mix of eeriness and dark humor.  The story begins as a daranged serial killer is on the verge of death and uses voodoo to transport his soul into a cutesy little doll from a kid's show in the movie. The plot thickens as a woman buys him for her 6 year old son, Andy.  The killer then decides to get revenge on numerous people who did him wrong when he was a man.  There was, to my supprise, very little gore.  A bit of blood but not that much for it's genre.  Only four deaths, so most of the scares come from the hard suspense.  I was on the edge of my seat for a while.  I thought it was very well done for it's time.  I would recommend buying or at least renting.  It's definitely worth seeing at least once.
B00005JLEU|5.0|apparently some of you american audiences don't understand the cultural value anime is to the japanese. anime is not merely a entertainment source for small children (like the ever-laughable mickey mouse), but viewed at the same level as live motion pictures. adults often can be seen, even, on the subways reading manga because it's the only alternate source for \\"adult\\" entertainment. (manga is generally considered adult material, anyway). perhaps that is the reason why there is so much skill and style put into their *art* than many american cartoons because it is not only a cartoon, but a form of artistic expression. <br /> <br />i wonder too, why people would complain about the PG rating when americans gave \\"The Ring\\" PG-13. wasn't this movie \\"disturbing\\" as well? or did i see a different version of it? digimon? please...i defy anyone to explain to me how a \\"plot\\", as it were, like this one would even be considered an influential item in society. <br /> <br />let's see, does a story about disfigured creatures to be used by humans as fighting tools send a more powerful message than a story of the awakening of a young child's lust for life after having experienced the most unfathomable and learning through this the importance of loving one's family and life? hm... difficult decision, i know.  <br /> <br />but of course.. we all have our preferences...only there is a difference between quality and mere paltriness.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|I was more interested with Anna and dracula's brides in the movie because they all were so beautiful. Dracula's brides really amazed me with their evil roles. I wasn't interested in the males because their roles were so boring and so weak. Van Helsing was okay.
1400032717|3.0|Well, the story was a bit weird. I picked up this book because of my friend's recommendation. I found that the leading character, Christopher, was a boy that liked to close his mind and stay in his own world. He couldn't accept things that were different from his styles. Anyway, this book was really special because there were many science and Maths questions inside. Readers can also get involved in the story and solved the problems with Christopher. The plot was quite up-and-down. Our mind could be trained to be more logic while reading. I learned more skills about how to analyse. And, the illustrations were pretty good, simple but clear.
B00000JZC4|1.0|I don't think any other song has made me feel more embarrassed for the singer. 'Nuff said.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I first heard Renee on her show, Still Standing.  I entered a trance as I sat watching her sing.  Her voice is so powerful and rich!  I rushed out to buy the CD right after and played it over and over again in my car before my husband took it to his car.  Great job, Renee
B000001IPL|5.0|The Offspring's third record, 1994's Smash, was the culmination of a decade of hard work, determination, and muscial growth. The band's first two albums, while not very successful commercially, were underground hits and helped the band attract a loyal following. With Smash, The Offspring were able to both please their longtime fans with another slate of catchy, high-energy rockers, and appeal to the mainstream with their three breakthrough singles - the slow, moody \\"Gotta Get Away\\", the Latin-tinger rocker \\"Come Out and Play\\", and the catchy \\"Self Esteem\\". Smash is one of the band's most well-rounded offerings, featuring a diverse collection of rock songs, and the band sounds like a well-oiled machine, with the passionate holler of Dexter Holland, the skillful riffs of guitarist Noodles, and the fast and furious drumming of Ron Welty. Their songwriting skills on the album also seem improved, as they tackle such topics as loss of faith, being an outcast, and road rage with fierce guitar riffs and strong, heartfelt vocals. Here are my thoughts on Smash's tracks... <br /> <br />INTRO (TIME TO RELAX): Good for a chuckle or two, this is just a 15-second or so blip urging the listener to \\"lean back and just enjoy the melodies\\". Good advice, if I do say so myself. <br /> <br />NITRO (YOUTH ENERGY): A kick-ass opener. Energetic, raging guitars, and furious drums. Awesome. <br /> <br />BAD HABIT - This song starts out slow with a cool bass intro but quickly builds to a fist-pumping, expletive-laced climax. A great, fast-paced song with loud, roaring guitars and a catchy chorus. <br /> <br />GOTTA GET AWAY - One of my favorites. Slow and menacing, with haunting vocals and throbbing guitars. One of the best Offspring songs set at a slow tempo. <br /> <br />GENOCIDE - Awesome guitar riffs, an infectious chorus, and a kick-ass bridge make this song another energetic, high-spirited effort. <br /> <br />SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN: Another one of my favorites. I love the vocals in thechorus, the breakneck drumming, and the dark, metal-sounding guitars. <br /> <br />COME OUT AND PLAY (KEEP 'M SEPARATED): The Offspring's breakout single, and for good reason. Loud and catchy, with a classic Middle-Eastern guitar riff and shout-along lyrics. Kick-ASS. <br /> <br />SELF ESTEEM: Another classic. Slow and slightly poppy, with an infectious guitar riff and chorus. <br /> <br />IT'LL BE A LONG TIME: I love Dexter's vocals in this fast-paced, political-themed rocker. The bridge is great, featuring a buildup from slow vocals to fast, raging guitars. <br /> <br />KILLBOY POWERHEAD: A cover of an obscure Didjits song. Catchy guitars and a good chorus, but the lyrics are kind of stupid. <br /> <br />WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU: A pretty good midtempo ska-rock song. I like the \\"He-ey!\\" shouts in the chorus. <br /> <br />SO ALONE: Short, fast, and awesome. I love the blazing guitars in the chorus, and the chants of \\"KILL! F*** OFF! HEY! DI-IE!\\"  are great. <br /> <br />NOT THE ONE - Kind of catchy, but probably my least favorite track. It's just a little too preachy and upbeat for my tastes, but it's not that bad. <br /> <br />SMASH - A spectacular, energetic closer. The lyrics in both the verses and chorus are catchy, the guitars are awesome, and the bridge is just sweet.  <br /> <br />
B0000TB01Y|3.0|I saw this musical in July and got the CD soon after.  While it is enjoyable, it is far from a great musical and certainly doesn't deserve 5 stars.  The Amazon.com review got it right on the head: great story, but the songs get in the way. <br /> <br />Kristin Chenowith and Idina Menzel are in fine form, and have a few standout songs, including The Wizard and I, Popular, Defying Gravity, Thank Goodness, and No Good Deed.  However, some songs are simply not necessary, such as Dear Old Shiz, (the horrendous) Something Bad, and March of the Witch Hunters.  They simply serve no purpose to the story.  Additionally, another problem is that many of the songs have long, unneccesary minute long introductions, which even The Wizard and I and Defying Gravity suffer from. <br /> <br />Whenever KC and IM duet, the sound is pretty good.  Dancing Through Life, One Short Day, and For Good all sound good musically, but have terribly cheesy lyrics.  In fact, For Good's lyrics are downright laughable, but the song is saved by the vocal talents of the leads. <br /> <br />I'm Not That Girl and As Long As You're Mine are okay songs, but in the show that just seem to get in the way.  As Long As You're Mine has the feel of the obligatory love song that can be sung forever at weddings and such.   <br /> <br />All in all, the vocals of KC and IM are what save this CD.  Avenue Q (which is brilliant) completely deserved the Tonys it won instead of Wicked.  As my title says, this CD and musical is good, but it's far from great.
B000002MP2|5.0|Listening to Dookie takes me back to a simpler time in my childhood, a time when my nighty homework was done in a matter of minutes, grades were the last thing on my mind, and the future didn't concern me one bit. This is one of the earliest CDs I can remember listening to - as usual, my oldest brother led the way, buying the CD and playing it for the rest of us at a time when I knew virtually nothing about the music industry (and was content with my ignorance). So it made sense that, ten years after its release, my purchase of Dookie would bring back a flood of memories  from days gone by. The two tracks I distinctly remembered from my youth - Basket Case and When I Come Around - hadn't lost any of their charm, and I was very pleased with the rest of the record. <br /> <br />Plain and simple, Dookie is one of those albums you just have to listen to. It was revolutionary in its time, and its fast-paced punk rockers are a great listen to this day. Green Day had, and still has, a gift for writing simple, instantly memorable pop-punk tracks, and their skill burst into full flower on Dookie. From the opening \\"I declare I don't care no more\\" of the catchy, energetic rocker Burnout to the conclusion of the edgy, angst-ridden F.O.D., Dookie is pure fun. There's nothing complex or shocking to be found here - it's fast, fun, mindless rock through and through.
B000001FE0|5.0|ODESSA,released in 1969,was a 2 LP set,now available on a single compact disc. My late uncle,a huge Bee Gees fan,never owned this album. My copy is second hand,because I got this at a garage sale years ago. The only hit from the album is FIRST OF MAY which would appear on 2001's THEIR GREATEST HITS-THE RECORD. The LP jacket was beautifully crafted. I love the solid red velvet. It was at this point in the history of the group that brothers Barry,Robin and Maurice Gibb carried on as a trio. This would last until Maurice's death in January 2003. There are three instrumental tracks on this album. They are SEVEN SEAS SYMPHONY,WITH ALL NATIONS and THE BRITISH OPERA.
B0001I55SS|2.0|Seems as if the plot for the movie \\"The Black Hole\\" got sucked into the title phenomena. One of the most elegant looking science fiction films from the late 70's, \\"The Black Hole\\" demonstrates that Disney's visual effects department could generate state of the art effects as good if not better than most but they couldn't generated a good script or good acting from the veteran cast.<br /><br /> Disney generated a string of box office flops during the 70's. \\"The Black Hole\\" although it earned back its production cost was another disappointment in a long time of disappointments.

Charles Pizer (Joseph Bottoms), Dr. Kate McCrae (Yvette Mimieux), Harry Booth (Ernest Borgnine) and V.I.N.CENT. (the voice of the late Roddy McDowall) stumble across a missing research vessel the U.S.S. Cygnus at the edge of a massive black hole. When the Palomino is damaged trying to escape the gravitational pull of the black hole, they must dock with the Cygnus unaware that the ship is being commanded by  Dr. Hans Reinhardt (Maximilian Schell). Surrounded by a crew of robots he has designed, Reinhardt's isolation may have driven him mad or, perhaps he was that way all along.<br /><br />Reinhardt has discovered an anti-gravity device that enables the Cygnus to stay within proximity to the black hole without being sucked inside it. Ultimately, Reinhardt plans on taking a probe into the black hole himself and traveling to wherever it might lead. Unfortunately, Reinhardt also has plans for the crew of the Palomino.<br /><br />This new re-release has only a nice widescreen anamorphic transfer enhanced for 16x9 TVs.

B00004XQP4|5.0|This songs on this album are very different from the two-minute, melodic tunes from Dookie, the hard and agressive songs from Insomniac, or even their album previous to Warning, Nimrod, which kind of broke into new territories. Since their Lookout days, this band has done a lot of exploring musically, as opposed to a lot of punk rock bands who have stuck to the pure punk and have repeated themselves. Warning is lighter music, more mature, more positive. Before this album, there have only been three Green Day songs to have acoustic guitars: Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life), Words I Might Have Ate, and FOD (which later turned into one of the hardest, thrashing tunes on the album). On Warning alone, there were six or seven out of twelve songs that acoustice guitars somewhere in the song. This album contains catchy tunes like Minority and Castaway, which probably are the most like classic Green Day, that will have anyone's foot stomping to the beat. There are also five minute pieces like Misery, Green Day's most ambitious song to date (keep in mind American Idiot doesn't come out for another month) which tells a story regaurding a few poor people who end up in (a town?) called misery. Then there are great songs like Blood, Sex, and Booze, Waiting, Deadbeat Holiday , and Church on Sunday which Green Day ahve blended their classic sound with their new abitions to create a new sound which is as enlightening as it is inspiring. Don't buy this expecting some more dookie, but listen to it with an open mind. If you happen to enjoy this more than the Dookie/Insomniac-era Green Day, Shenanigans is a b-side album that captivates Green Day on their lighter side on songs Rotting, On the Wagon, Tired of Waiting for You, etc. that you will probably enjoy. But as a Green Day and Music fan, I must recommend every Green Day album, for any is a great investment and will surely capture your heart in some way, shape, or form.
B00005JMCN|5.0|There are lots of movies that feature horses and dogs and other animals, and sometimes I cringe at them. For me there is a way to do \\"animal movies\\" wrong.  When animals are portrayed as almost human I think it's not only unrealistic, but it's disrespectful to both the animals and to humans.<br /><br />I don't doubt that the great race-horses are absolutely incredible athletes.  I don't doubt that they like to run, perhaps even love to race.  I believe that a racehorse can even be competitive and recognizes that he or she is involved in a footrace and wants to beat those horses running alongside.<br /><br />After that I believe they want a drink of water and a bag of oats and to have their lustrous coats rubbed down.  Seabiscuit gets it right.  The three main human characters are revealed gradually: Jeff Bridges' Charles Howard, a likable man who builds a fortune in the fledgling automotive industry and buys himself a racehorse; Chris Cooper's Tom Smith, a horse trainer who understands horses and even moreso, has faith in them; Tobey Maguire as Red Pollard, a jockey whose family has lost it all in the depression, and almost throws away all of his opportunities as well before Howard and Smith and a horse who really likes to run fast rescue him from life's scrap-heap.<br /><br />These stories are interwoven skillfully and you'd have to be a hard-hearted cynic to not feel the thrill in the climactic race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral.
B0000011P7|5.0|In his first solo album, Ian Anderson set out to make something different from the acoustic guitar/flute music he is known for. He went into the studio with Peter-John Vettese, a young, innovative keyboardist who worked on Jethro Tull's previous album Broadsword and the Beast and Tull's next album Under Wraps. He had no outtakes from previous Tull recordings with which to work. Everything on this album was written from scratch (Vettese co-wrote half the songs). The result was a very electronic album and, clocking in at under 40 minutes, a very quick yet interesting trip through one man's imagination in the emerging computer age. It is even more experimental than what Tull was doing at the time because, alas, Martin Barre does not appear on the album and even Anderson's characteristic flute only emerges occasionally. Think a softer \\"A\\" (which was originally meant to be Anderson's first solo project; the \\"A\\" standing for \\"Anderson\\") and Under Wraps completely dominated by synthesizers. I enjoy the overall sound of this album, but, then again, I am also a big fan of Tull's experimental years of the early 1980s. Under Wraps is one of my all-time favorite albums, and Walk Into Light resembles that album more than any other Tull record. It does not have the same variety of sound as Under Wraps, but each track can stand alone very well though, for the most part, they all have a similar feel. One stand-out track is \\"Made in England.\\" I find myself humming along. It is excellent with interesting lyrics: \\"Watches the democratic process grind its way through the Commons who would pave the streets with England's gold.\\" \\"Fly By Night,\\" the haunting \\"Black & White Television\\" and \\"Toad in the Hole\\" are also very catchy. \\"User-Friendly\\" reminds me of \\"Dot Com\\" from Tull's 1999 release of the same name; both using buzzwords of the day showing that Anderson definitely keeps up with the times. \\"Different Germany\\" is interesting both lyrically and musically. I wonder if a specific experience prompted Anderson to write \\"Different Germany, history repeats somehow. Different Germany, afraid to know you now\\" (written, of course, before the wall came down). At one point, Vettese kicks in with a progressive keyboard part that wakes up the listener. If you do not like Tull's A--Under Wraps material...I recommend listening to them again because those albums are awesome. But, if you know you will never like electronic experimental Tull, you will probably not like Walk Into Light. Fans of early 1980s Tull and/or electronic music, will enjoy Anderson's first, and for the most part forgotten, solo project.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie has been torn apart by all sides, both the right and the left (see Christopher Hitchens' wonderful dissection of it in Vanity Fair), as being factually innaccurate and misleading.  That being said, I think it's great that we live in a country where someone can express their views in such a way.  It's just too bad that so many educated people are putting stock in this garbage.  This is the same man who said last year that Osama Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty!  That's a bold and ridiculous statment.
B00001NFCY|1.0|This is the kind of pretentious, meritless music that is out of date before it is released.  Creed essentially takes the music of the early nineties and dumbs it down for thoughtless teenagers who subsist musically by clenching their fist bringing it down to reveal a determined snarl before they push the nitrous button. Scott Stapp's posing and posturing in Creed's videos resembles a a Power Ranger' parody.  He looks to the sky while the elements are blowing everyhthing else away however he remains indomitable.  His arms are wide open to allow the power of the ages surge through him musically.  There is no novelty or imagination only simple hooks and droning guitars complemented with a self satisfied voice telling the listener his hard won secrets.  Secrets such as \\"can you take me higher...\\" reveal nothing except thoughtless attempts at enlightenment. If you enjoy this style of music and want to go \\"higher\\" revisit some of the bands from the earlier ninties, and avoid this insipid group.
B0000026DJ|5.0|Great album.  See others for more detailed reviews. But for the people that don't know what the sound is on \\"Bullroarer\\" (it is not a slowed down helicopter blade!), the sound is a .... Bullroarer!  It is an aboriginal \\"musical instrument\\" used in some holy ceremonies. It is a flat piece of wood with a string tied to it and swung around the head.
B0000524CY|3.0|lol calm down folks after reading the reviews of this movie on here you would think that this movie was REALLY scary but when it comes down to it i didnt think it was scary at all.. really its just a physchological thriller.. the only parts of the movie that i felt were disturbing is when reagan first gets possesed other than that i thougth that the movie was entertaining but not scary.. i dont see what all the hype around it was though maybe it is because i watched it with so much expectations that i didnt think it was that scary but yeah it is still a entertaining movie to watch a little bit disturbing (not that much) but an ok horror flick
B00009XITP|4.0|I honestly thought that this would be a boring movie, but it proved its worth. The line-dancing scene was my favorite. It was so funny when the grandmother got up and started shaking to the beat! I could not stop laughing! But, they should have given granny a bigger part!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|First of all, Unearth is amazing! This CD is a learning experience to those intending to start a metal band and listen to top quality music. I specially enjoy those E riffs riding through the song with the drum kicks following each note. This reminds me of old Sepultura. But then there are technical parts like the best of Swedish melodic death metal bands style.  <br /> <br />The only flaw, like in most melodic metalcore record in my oppinion ( and I bet you'll disagree with me) is those breakdowns. Damn breakdowns. I hate when the singers think they can sing with clean voice without sounding dumb and too melodic for a band like this one. That was my problem with Slipknot and Killswitch Engage. What I do appreciate in this record is that many of the breakdowns are yelled instead of sung and reminds me a lot of Refused (I know their sound is different). If you're into heavy metal, melodic, nwobhm, thrash, new hardcore or any metal variations you'll probably enjoy this CD as much I did. <br /> <br />One of the few bands which can make breakdowns sound cool and not cheesy or rubbish. A must have, well produced with excellent riffs and distorted vocals in some places which also make the difference. Get it, you'll not regret. I promise.
B00002MZ2C|4.0|RATM takes hard funk guitar and combines it with in your face political lyrics that can make anyone jump out of their chair and move to the music. Even though I do not agree with everything De La Rocha stands for, he still is able to lift a majority of people up and get rocking to the music. I believe that Tom Morellos insane guitar riffs do the more to the music than the lyrics.
0061015725|3.0|This book was entertaining enough. Not as great as Jurassic Park, but still worth reading.  That is if you are like me and know nothing about Nanotechnology.  He tells you just enough so that you are interested and want to keep reading but doesn't drive you crazy with details.  Apparently if you know more about nanotechnology and other technologies that are written about in this book, you may not like the book as much.  But really if you are geeky enough (I mean no offense, by using the word geek) to work with this stuff in real life, then you should read non-fiction and not fiction books dealing with this subject.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Well..After hearing duality on TV i shouldve known what was coming..this is NOT the slipknot i know and love..this is stone sour (even though i do like them)...i hope the next album is slipknot though..
0553801546|4.0|I really liked the Fool's Errand and Golden Fool a LOT. And after reading Golden Fool, I was expecting something to happen between the Fool and Fitz. Something great and unique. But in the end, I thought Hobb didnt really give us what she hinted at so many times in the previous books. I felt duped since she poured so many hints throughout the rest of the previous books.  <br /> <br />Anyways, like many other reviewers here, I am sorely disappointed by the ending. Everything else was great except for the relationship between the Fool and Fitz. This book was supposed to wrap up the mystery. But instead, what Hobb gives us is a box of the same old chocolates. So disappointing.. but go ahead and read it. It's a good book still. Just a tad flat.
0156027321|5.0|I had the great pleasure of listeing to the audio book version (unabridged). I was pleasently surprised by a man reading the text with a small childlike voice in the expected Indian dilect. I was so engrossed I actually took an hour long detour to make sure I heard the ending! Fanstastic!
B000022TSH|5.0|Ok first off I have watched this movie 8 times already and every time I watch it I think of how talented Jack Nicholson is in the roles he plays. He plays his roles out well always. I would recommend this film always. I could never get sick of watching Chinatown always. My name is Dan G and a I have been a fan of Nicholson's since I was 4. The first movie my dad rented was Batman and even though I was young he and I watched it and we both enjoyed it. I know have Batman on dvd. Jack Nicholson always plays interesting roles whether he's the villian or hero he's always got mad talent. Polanski wrote a great script. The plot is just so clever that it leaves you guessing who's in what for what until the end. I saw the sequal to Chinatown and loved it as well. I have both on dvd as well. The script is cool sounding and has a nice feel to it. The characters do their parts well. Jack made me laugh alot. He knows how to be touching and assertive and many other things. As Jake Gittes he really played the part well. he amazed me when I saw this. The film really captures those times well. I give Jack Nicholson thumbs up to this and I clap for him. Go see this movie on dvd or vhs. I wasn't let down by it
0765310015|5.0|Ruled by its ambitious Empress, the Malazan Empire has sent its armies on a wave of conquest with one city-state after another falling. Not by coincidence, the armies most loyal to the overthrown Empire suffer most of the casualties. Former General, and now Sergeant Whiskeyjack has seen his company shrunk to a handful--given one incompetent officer after another. One city stands in the way of Malazan's capture of another continent--and Whiskeyjack and his company are sent to prepare for the Empire's takeover--and to die. The Empire has more weapons in its quiver--because the remaining city, Darnjhistan, has gathered powerful allies of its own. And the gods seem intent on playing a role--something that the Empress definitely intends to head off.<br /><br />Author Steven Erikson creates a complex and powerful world with morally ambivalent forces battling one another. The warren-based spell system is an interesting take on the use of magic and the rich history underlying Erikson's world adds a dimension to the story.<br /><br />I had a hard time getting into this story. The first hundred pages was tough going, with too many characters, most of whom appeared undermotivated and unsympathetic. Erikson's strong writing and the interesting world kept me going. Once the story got to Darnjhistan, however, things definitely picked up. The gods, the mortals, and the godlike powers play their games and it's fascinating stuff. If you like high fantasy, you should give GARDENS OF THE MOON a try.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|This movie has a terrific cast and an interesting story-line. The movie's subtext, however, is troubling.  The characters in this film are, with one or two exceptions, dysfunctional, foul-mouthed, and sex-obsessed. Hollywood (or England's equivalent) may think this is reality, but to most Americans, and I suspect most Brits, it is not. This is a flawed and disappointing movie.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|Subsequent seasons of Six Feet Under have not quite been able to reach the writing, directing and atmosphere that this, the second season, attained.  <br /> <br />The main thrust of this season is on Nate and Brenda's relationship. Spiralling downward and out of control, Brenda (played maginficently by Rachel Griffiths) is perhaps the most sexually psychotic character TV has seen. This one particular storyline kept me anticipating each week's new episode. As Nate (Peter Krause) slowly discovers and puts the pieces together of Brenda's psychosis you can't help be caught up in this web of deciet. The confrontation between Nate and Brenda can only be compared to that of The Soprano's final episode of season four...where Carmella throws Tony out and doesn't look back. Intense, thrilling and just desserts. Simply riveting. <br /> <br />In all a great season of one of HBO's finest. If only season's 3 and 4 (still in progress) could have been this good.
B000244EMO|4.0|I am not going to write what has pretty much been already written about this movie. It's amazing all the way through. All the extras included are great addition that enhance the film. <br /> <br />My one and only gripe is the packaging. It seems Fox is content in putting out theit collector's edition DVD's in this crappy cardboard packaging. The disc tray is not even glued on to the cardboard and as time goes the stickiness of the putty disappears. They did the same thing with the Alien Quadrilogy set. An amazing movie such as this deserves better attention to detail and care in the packaging department.
B00008H2LB|3.0|After the success of \\"Hybrid theory\\",it was obvious that big things were expected from linkin park's sophmore effort.It was always going to be difficult to make an album that would top the first time effort.And to be honest i dont think these guys hav.This album is short,only 37 minutes long.Most of the songs have Mike Shinoda rapping more often then chester sings and it just doesnt feel like a real metal album.it seems as if creativity is lacking and not enough effort was put into writing the songs.However a few songs and the lone fact that this band consists of some talented musicians saves this album.It's still worth a listen for hardcore fans of linkin park inspite of all the above mentioned flaws.
B00006M183|5.0|Admittedly, \\"Ten\\" is Pearl Jam's most influential and important album. But personally, I don't consider it their best. That title would go to either \\"No Code\\", or this masterpiece, \\"Riot Act\\". It didn't contain any huge singles, nor did it put Pearl Jam back into the mainstream, but it's an extremely rewarding listen.    \\"Can't Keep\\" is a chilling, omnious introduction in which vocalist Eddie Vedder sings, \\"I don't live forever, you can't keep me here\\". The mid-tempo accoustic sound is a change of pace from the intensity of other PJ openers like \\"Go\\", \\"Last Exit\\", and \\"Brain of J\\".     Speaking of intensity, \\"Save You\\" is a raucous hard rocker about a selfish quest to save a friend from self-destruction. It's a clear standout, but the numerous f-words doomed it from any radio potential (although it was released as a single, edited).    \\"Love Boat Captain\\" is an soulful, emotional ballad written about the 9 or so fans who died at one of their concerts (in a mosh pit mishap). Despite the serious lyrical content, it's upbeat and powerful, featuring a moving vocal performance from Eddie Vedder.    \\"Cropduster\\" is one of my favorites, if not my favorite on the album. It's an atmospheric hard rocker with great melodies and hooks. It also employs some odd time signatures (6/4, 7/4) which aren't too typical in PJ songs.    \\"I Am Mine\\" was the first single, and the only song that got some radio airplay. As someone else once described it, it sounds like some sort of a pirate ship anthem with its galloping 12/8 rhythm. \\"I know I was born and I know that'll die, the in between is mine..I am mine..\\" is a small sample of some of the poignant lyrics delivered by Eddie Vedder throughout.    After the dark, melancholy folk of \\"Thumbing My Way\\" (another emotionally moving song) comes the experimental \\"You Are\\". It's a very soulful, passionate tune built around a hypnotizing beat.    \\"Green Disease\\" is a rousing new-wave romp that blasts corruption and greed. Then there's the controversial \\"Bushleager\\", a bitter, spoken word rant against our commander-in-chief (as if that wasn't obvious from the title). While some may think Pearl Jam (or any band for that matter) should keep their political gripes to themselves, I personally love it. It also kinda helps if you despise George W. Bush ;)    After the spiritual tribal chanting of \\"Arc\\", the album closes with wistful \\"All Or None\\", which keeps in Pearl Jam's common tradition of ending their albums on an introspective note.    Other standouts on the album include the bluesey rocker, \\"1/2 Full\\", reflective hard rock of \\"Ghost\\", and the eerie & bizarre vibes of \\"Help Help\\".     As I'm sure many others have said, if you're looking for another \\"Ten\\", look elsewhere. It's a great album, but there's not gonna be another one. Rather than contiously longing for the guys to make another big, arena rock album, sit down and enjoy what they're doing now. They still make great, intelligent music, and \\"Riot Act\\" is the epitome of it.    Best Songs: Cropduster, Save You, You Are, Help Help, 1/2 Full, Love Boat Captain.
B00005JN2F|5.0|I'm one of the few folks who never got around to seeing \\"The Bourne Identity.\\" I can tell you, you don't have to have seen it to enjoy the sequel, since there is enough of a quick synopsis to let you know the scoop on what is going on. Bourne and his girlfriend are living out their lives in Goa, India by the beach. They are 2 of the very few white faces in town and stick out like sore thumbs. Even though they've been there quite a while, they haven't even picked up so much as a decent tan to try to blend in. A dubious Russian character plants Bourne's finger print in a conspicuous place after assassinating a CIA informant and the person the informant was trying to buy documents from in Germany. While the CIA tries to track down Bourne, the Russian goes to Goa to finish him off so that it will all look like a good clean tie-off to the intrigue - the film never explains how  the Russian traced him to India - but his blonde hair and blonde girlfriend do stick out there, after all.<br /><br />Are there holes in the plot? Sure - but everything happens so fast, you really don't notice until hours after the movie as you try to absorb everything you experience during the film.<br /><br />The language is not paint-peeling like most films today and there is no nudity or sexual activity. There is a lot of shooting, one person gets strangled to death, another drowns and many many cars get crashed all over the place. The camera play is so on target, you feel like you are in the car with Bourne as cars go zig-zagging and spinning inbetween other cars. I was literally on the edge of my seat during most of this film.<br /><br />The action is stimulating enough to appeal to the low-brow crowd and intellectually stimulating enough as to not put those with higher brain functions into a coma. My heart was beating like crazy during this film, as I felt like I was more of a participant than a viewer.<br /><br />Bourne's character is something else - he is apparently fluent in German, Hindi & Russian as well as English - and perhaps fluent in other languages as well. He is a good shot, an incredible defensive driver, sensitive, loyal, decent, articulate and just an all-around good guy who has been done wrong by many levels of government. Unlike James Bond, who is supplied by Q with the latest in technological gadgets, Bourne can make-do with anything he finds if he has to, and he doesn't have to go bed-hopping to do it. Move over, James Bond, you've met your match!rman, Hindi & Russian as well as English - and perhaps fluent in other languages as well.

B0000027RL|5.0|The early 90's rock scene was dominated by Nirvana and Pearl Jam, two bands that went from no names to superstars in a short period. Pearl Jam's massive success came as a result of their debut album, \\"Ten\\", an album which still remains their most popular and critically acclaimed today. It's also the biggest sounding Pearl Jam album, full of stadium sized rock anthems, blistering guitar solos, and memorable hooks.  More than half of the album received heavy airplay on radio stations, a few of which are still in constant rotation.  <br /> <br />\\"Once\\" is an intense, angry opener written from the point of view of a crazed serial killer. It's actually the second part in a trilogy of songs that Eddie Vedder claimed were thematically linked. The first part is \\"Alive\\", possibly the most popular Pearl Jam song ever. It's a 5+ minute modern rock classic with a powerful, anthematic chorus, and it culminates with an awe inspiring, Hendrix-like guitar solo from Mike McCready. Lyrically, it's a disturbing tale that essentially involves a mother coming onto her son, causing the son to go crazy and start killing people (thus, the story behind \\"Once\\") <br /> <br />\\"Even Flow\\" is another radio staple with fiery guitar riffs, a classic chorus, and another blistering guitar solo. Like \\"Alive\\", it deals with a serious subject (homelessness), but its anthematic qualities completely mask that aspect of it. <br /> <br />\\"Black\\" and \\"Jeremy\\" are two more of Pearl Jam's most popular and beloved songs. The former is a powerful, haunting ballad about lost love. It starts pretty gentle and reaches a moving climax as Eddie Vedder emotionally sings, \\"I know someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky, but why can't it be mine?\\". The song was so personal to him that he refused to perform it live for the longest time. Somehow it became a radio staple, despite never being officially released as a single. The latter, \\"Jeremy\\", is a stadium sized anthem with akiller hook, and a passionate outro. It's based on a true story about a kid named Jeremy who went to the front of his class, pulled out a gun, and shot himself in the head. Cute, eh?  <br /> <br />The second half isn't nearly as \\"epic\\", but I think the songs on it have aged better since they haven't been played ad nauseum on the radio for the past 12 years. \\"Oceans\\" is a serene, gorgeous love ballad in which Eddie Vedder reaches a chill inducing falsetto. Another favorite of mine is the angst-ridden \\"Porch\\", probably the angriest, most intense song on here.  <br /> <br />The album closes with one of Pearl Jam's most introspective songs, \\"Release\\". It's a slow, emotional ballad..so emotional and personal to Eddie Vedder that it's the only song on the album whose lyrics don't appear in the liner notes. <br /> <br />I didn't go through every song, but some other great tunes include the furious \\"Why Go\\", the urgent, epic vibes of \\"Deep\\", and the ominous, brooding \\"Garden\\". Wait, I think that *is* everything now.  <br /> <br />I'm sure reviewing this album is moot, as most people already have it. But if you don't, get it without hesitation. The most popular songs like \\"Alive\\", \\"Jeremy\\" and \\"Even Flow\\" are great..but there's much more to it than them. In fact, some of the best songs on here are the hidden gems in the second half. Really, all 11 songs are excellent. I couldn't say a bad thing about any of them.  <br /> <br />Highly Recommended. <br /> <br />Best Songs: Black, Release, Porch, Oceans, Jeremy.  <br />
0156027321|3.0|Martel is a wonderful writer, no question.  He has constructed an entertaining and magical fable about the survival of a young boy in a very difficult situation!  His writing about animals is simply marvelous, the best I've come across.  It obviously comes from a deep knowledge and love of all living, moving, things.<br /><br />As a philosopher, a critic of religion and the lack of it, i.e., atheism, Martel simply loads the dice for his own version of Pascal's wager, and lets loose.  His views of atheism are simply wrong and crude, and he biases his presentation in the traditional ways of the romantic believer.  At the end, we have a choice of \\"dry, yeastless factuality,\\" and his fable.  \\"Which is the better story?\\" he asks.  Well, some authors, maybe the ancient Greeks, might have preferred the facts as a basis of their stories.  Martel can't even fathom that possibility.<br /><br />Read this book as a vastly entertaining yarn, and a marvelously sympathetic gallery of animal life.  Don't expect anything deeper, unless you're already a confirmed believer in God.
0767803434|4.0|In this age of terrorism, this is an intensely scary film. Imagine Al-Quada doing what these Russian terrorists do on this plane.  Harrison Ford is good in these types of films and gives a very good performance.  The violence was hard to watch, but it is not difficult to imagine this kind of hatred esprecially from Islamic or other militant and closed-minded terrorist groups.   <br /> <br />Hang on to your seats, this is a good one.  <br />

For the first time in my life I felt lucky to be a smoker, as it allowed me to gasp for breath and leave the theater a few times.<br /><br />Why there were talented actors in this syrupy, ludicrous and stomach turning piece of bile is beyond my comprehension.  I can only rationalize it this way: Hugh Grant needed money for another prostitute, Billy Bob Thornton was on something, and Liam Neeson thought it was a parody of a romance film.<br /><br />Did The Blair Witch Project scare you?  Wait till you see this one.
B000092Q4U|5.0|When Lamb Of God starts out its incredible. There riffs are harder then almost anything metal bands are playin now a days. As a band i think theyve improved tremendous amounts from there first two second album. I am also looking forward to there newest album, Ashes Of The Wake. It looks to be better then this. Lamb Of God has to be one of the hardest, metal bands out there right now. the only thing that compares to this cd, is seeing them live. Now thats an experience. But what every you do Go and buy this cd!!!!!!!!!!!!
0061015725|2.0|This is my first review so I'll try and make as much sense as possible.  When I first got this book I was expecting one fantastic novel, whether I got the impression from the hard white cover or the fact that it was a present from my well read uncle I am still unsure. If all this had somehow subconciously raised the hype, then expect this review to be somewhat reflected in how I thought Prey would have been. <br /> <br />To start off I want to describe the characters- not that it they are anything you wouldn't expect.  The general list consists of the a frightened scientist and his big busted loveinterest, a resourceful oriental, a gentle-yet-loud-and-obnoxious-lard (my personal fav), and the reluctant hero with marital problems.  It may sound pretty versitle but trust me each of the characters is nothing but a weathered copies from Chrichtons former novels. They are predictable, most are boring, and Chrichton's idea of character development is having finally chosen between which diaper brand should be bought (literally).  The characters are the biggest flaw in the novel, and unfortunatley this flaw is what brings the book down 1 star. <br /> <br />The plot. Chrichton does a fantastic job in building suspense for the reader before the dilemma is even discovered. If i had not read the preview on the back I would never had guessed at what awaited the hero out in the desert. Continuing on Chrichton does a good job explaining the advanced in nanotechnology. Its amazing stuff.  However the plot suffers a blow towards the end with one unexplained plot hole. Without giving too much away ((THIS MAY BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER)) If each particle cloud is stupid, how would they have the power to actually control a human body- make it say things, do things, and act the way it does if they cant even come up with simple solutions. Hell, if glass looks like swiss cheese to nano particles how did it take them 10 minutes to get into a car? ((END SPOILER)) This little things in the endkept the eyes rolling. - 1 stars. <br /> <br />In the end, the twists are interesting enouph to keep reading on, and trust me there are twists. Chrichton does what he set forth to do. Write a semi interesting book to sell to the Jurrassic park fanbase. And it will inevitably reach the best sellers ect.  However, for a book that will probably not get a sequel, the hanging ending just doesnt seem to fit the rest of the book. And for me the ending is very very important. -1 star. <br /> <br />So if you are looking for a mildly interesting book go ahead and pick it up. It serves its purpose as I stated already- and that is to entertain us-and to add a couple $10 bills in the back pocket on Chrichton's jeans. But hey im not judging.
0061040967|5.0|In the end there is always death. Cohen the Barbarian, a legend if there ever was one, is well aware of this fact of life. Although he still remembers the glorious times when he was a young, potent stallion and still knew where he had put his forsaken teeth, the Discworld has moved on. The days of the Great Adventures are long since gone and nobody believes in heroes anymore. Together with his old friends, Truckle the Uncivil, Boy Willie, Mad Hamish and Vena the Raven-Haired, he decides to finally let go. But when they do, they do with it with vengeance! Returning to the Gods what was stolen in the first place does seem to be a nice and final statement. But what they don't know is that their little statement will end the world, everything and most of all the life of Rincewind. Everyone knows that this must be stopped, because if everything ends Rincewind will have problems finding something to hide behind.<br /><br />Although in fact The Last Hero is quite a short novel in comparison to the other Discworld books, it has all it takes to compete with the best of them. Indeed the appearance of Discworld most qualified anti-hero Rincewind has been known as a guarantee for success. Nevertheless the most appealing part for me was the waterfall of references to modern space travel. What else could lead to such a nice catchphrase as: \\"Ank-Morpork, we have an orangutan\\".<br /><br />To make this episode of the Discworld saga even more wonderful, Paul Kirby took this opportunity to prove that he is the ultimate Discworld-illustrator. If there was ever a guild of Discworld-illustrators, Paul would be they one and only God. In The Last Hero the role of Paul is even more special. He does not only brighten up this Discworld fable, but also adds to the story. Some jokes are purely visual like the testing of the Dragon-driven-space-suit or the architecture of the space ship.<br /><br />Although many joke only reach their full potential if you know something about the Discworld background, it still stays very accessible as a first contact with Discworld.round, it still stays very accessible as a first contact with Discworld.
B00000DC7J|5.0|Piazolla was a master without restrictions . His approach to the tango is more than a simple coincidence . It was a real twist of fate .<br /><br />When Gardel knew about his virtouosity (being a teenager) , he requested the permission to hire him , but this petition was denied by Piazzola ' s father. That request was just the last tour in Gardel 's life . So, when Gardel dies in that no sense and stupid accident in Medellin (Colombia) , Piazzola felt the inner solitude and he decided to transform the tango and carrying it to a top level. He decided to study in Paris with Nadia Boulanger and the rest is story.<br /><br />The Milonga del angel is one of his greatest compositions , but his expressiveness and powerful sense of musicality are out from his own time. Died on 1992 July 5, his name keeps growing among the new music lovers.<br /><br />Since my favorite Piazzola one is Adios Nonino (in memoriam of his recent died father), works such Tangedia or Mumuki are loaded of tragical mood .<br />He composed la balada para un loco (The ballad for a mad )sung for Amelita Baltar his wife in that age.<br /><br />His status as artist has so many virtues that you will be surprised with his rapture inspiration. I was an exception witness when I saw him twice in Caracas in 1977, when Aldemaro Romero a venezuelan conductor and gifted composer invited him for The New Wave Festival playing with the  Caracas Philarmonic Orchestra, one of the best historical orchestras (if not the best) in the story of my country.<br /><br />Enter into Piazzola world and you will be rewarded.
B00003CXCT|4.0|It was the opening weekend in May 1977, when my late father Bob took me to see \\"A New Hope.\\"  It was playing at the local drive-in theater near the Air Force Base I used to live on.  When I was 5 years old near Austin, Texas.  I was scared at the beginning of the film when that huge Star Destroyer ship appeared firing on a smaller ship over the planet of Tattooine.  \\"A New Hope\\" was the very first film I ever saw in my entire life.  It inspired me to become a writer when I became an adult.  I owe a huge debt to George Lucas for inspiring me to create and to write.  I want to shake his hand and thank him for showing me \\"the universe.\\"  I am so excited to own \\"A New Hope\\" as part of the DVD release of the classic trilogy.  I only wish Lucas had made the prequels just as good as the classic three.  What needed to be done with the prequels is to let Lucas write the films but let others direct them.  It made sense fot the classic films, it should have been done for the prequels, at least for Episode II and III.  Finally, may the force continue to be with us for years to come...<br /><br />Please release the unaltered \\"cleaned up\\" version of the middle trilogy on BLU RAY and Ultra High Definition formats in time for the 40th Anniversary, the year 2017...
B00003CXB4|5.0|Undoubtly we are living a new golden age in this genre . Walt Disney Productions reveals an astonishing creative vitality.<br /><br />The lion king is a film in which  ensamble almost to a perfection level all the elements that bcome to the cinema to art category .<br /><br />The film of deep shakesperian roots is apparently a film for kids but it is an adult story .<br /><br />Julie Taymor was the director of this film and became the passport for her to make Titus in 2000 .
B00006CXXU|4.0|This CD is not  a movie soundtrack, but she tries to make it just that.  Christina's resume.  It starts off with an intro you would expect from Miramax. (Chuckle)  And leads to the song I Loved, but could not remeber the name of.  She presents a variety of styles to show that tallent is not necessarily restricted to style.  Only about 4 \\"well\\" know songs.  Still, the combined effort makes it's mark, and I rate this an \\"overall\\" good CD.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill Volume 2 picks up right after volume 1 ends, and so far the Black Mamba has 3 more people on her death list. After watching volume 1, I was amazed at the level of blood and overly exaggerated violence and I expected the same here. Forget that--volume 2 is very different from the first in that the focus is not on the blood and fighting, but on the story as it nears the great climax between the Bride and Bill. I was not disappointed in the difference but I was amazed as much with this volume because of how well it was put together. Questions arising from volume 1 are answered here as we see things such as what led to the massacre at the wedding chapel. Similarly, loose ends from the first volume are cleared up here. At the start, Uma is on her way to find Bill, and then in Tarantino fashion we get to see the events leading up to that point. Anyone who has seen V.1 must see this movie. For those who enjoy the violence the most you may be a little letdown from this movie. I can't imagine that though since it does so much to complete the story. Don't worry though, there is plenty of action and fighting so don't get the idea that Tarantino gets soft on this part. Overall I think most people will be more than satisfied with the second part of Kill Bill. <br /> <br />Video and sound quality are very good on this release, with the obvious negative being a lack of extras. What is here is okay, but supposedly there is a lot more that might turn up on a better edition in the future. I will buy that version when it hits, but until then this is a nice dvd to own for fans of action/Tarantino movies or for anyone looking to see a great movie.
B000286RJI|5.0|Loved it!  I've watched it several times already, and each time it makes me smile.  If you feel the need for revenge, watch this instead.  Better than the first volume.
B00008H2LB|5.0|The first time I listened to Hybrid Theory, I was smitten. I can honestly say I had never, ever listened to anything as catchy or memorable before (and I listen to all genres, including classical, rap, pop, techno and rock.) So, like a lot of LP fans, I was a little apprehensive when I bought Meteora, fearing the \\"sophomore jinx\\". True to my fear, Meteora did disappoint the first two times around. Even though Linkin Park hadn't lost their sound, something seemed like it was missing; I just wanted more of Hybrid Theory. <br /> <br />Fortunately, after listening to Meteora a few more times, the cd grew on me. At first glance, the cd sounds a lot softer than Hybrid. But it makes up for that by sounding a lot heavier, too. In other words, the rap is softer, and the rock is heavier. There are exceptions to this, such as Easier to Run, Breaking the Habit, and From The Inside. They all sound soft in the way that In The End and Crawling sounded soft--soft but hard at the same time. They're kind of funky, for a lack of a better word. You need to listen to them a few times to get used to them, and then a few more times to really appreciate them. <br /> <br />And, like I said before, other songs like Don't Stay, Faint, Lying from You, Figure.09 are more \\"metal\\" than most of the tracks on Hybrid. They just sound angrier than before, and unlike the softer songs, they clicked immediately.  <br /> <br />There are a few odd-balls like Easier to Run and Nobody's Listening, but yet again, Linkin Park still manages to sound like themselves.   <br /> <br />By the fourth listen, I was really getting the hang of Meteora. Once I picked up the nuances, I liked it a lot better than Hybrid Theory. So Meteroa is a little different... thats not a bad thing: it has a lot more maturity and variety...it grows on you and eventually comes to equal, and maybe even surpass, Hybrid Theory.
B0000025F7|5.0|There's been alot of people talking about how they're <br />interest in Michael Jackson has vanished in the wake of his <br />many activities as 'wacko Jacko'.Well people deal with it-this <br />was WAY before that!'Off The Wall' couldn't get any cooler!A <br />tad polished up yes,but VERY cool from classics like the steamy <br />\\"Rock With You\\" (one of my favorite MJ songs) and James Brown- <br />like funk in \\"Working Day & Night\\" and the oddly titled  <br />\\"Burn This Disco Out\\".My favorite tracks on this album are the <br />opening cut \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\"-filled with high <br />energy and Paulinho DaCosta's lightening-paced percussion-there's <br />also a rockin' mini-moog solo in the bridge that's just plain <br />HOT!Then there's \\"Get On The Floor\\",cut in the same steamy <br />cloth with Louis Johnson's thumping bass,BIG,big horns and <br />Jackson panting and heaving his way through much of it. <br />              On the softer side Stevie Wonder's brilliant <br />\\"I Can't Help It\\" is forbodingly romantic in BOTH artist's <br />finest styles while his Paul McCartney cover in \\"Girlfriend\\" <br />is made ever so soulful with the accompanyment of keyboardist <br />George Duke!The only song I'm not too crazy about is <br />\\"She's Out Of My Life\\"-the lyrics are too whiney and sad and <br />the song is pretty sappy-I think Streisand is better at that <br />sort of thing.But even that made Jackson into an al around <br />entertainer who wasn't about to abandon his African American <br />following...yet.The funky groove of the title song and the <br />mild pop of \\"It's The Falling In Love\\" with Patti Austin make <br />'Off The Wall' a well rounded pop album and every song is <br />very memorable and well produced by Quincy Jones!Not a bad seed <br />to be found here as far as I'm concerned! <br />
B00006V9A0|5.0|I love grunge music and what band better to love than Nirvana the Kings Of Grunge these guys have really outdone themselves in thier time they were the biggest rock band around tragically Kurt Cobain left us but his music still lives on and buying this Album proves it how can you forget the high school anthem of Smells Like Teen Spirit or the Rocking In Bloom or the sad emotion behind All Apologies this is a must for any grunge fan
0739313126|5.0|Loved the story.  Could not put it down.  Followed it up with Angels and Demons.  Wish I had read Angels & Demons first.  Either way both were fantastic.
B000001Y2U|3.0|This album is ok it has a few songs on here that a worth a listen but most of it seems filler too me and it doesnt put out as much power as Mechanical Animals does..........I'd say Mechanical Animals is Mansons best this would prob be his 3rd best 2nd being Hollywood anyways this isnt that great of an album stick with Mechanical Animals
014028009X|4.0|This wasn't my type of book but that's just me.  I did read the entire book, however, I personally didn't find this type of read interesting.  But I can say that it would make a great beach read or nothing else to do read.  The writer's writing and style was good.  If this is your type of book, I'd recommend it.
0312305060|3.0|Michael Cunnigham wrote this novel extremely well, each sentance is enticing and outstanding.  I loved how he described nature, the characters and their lives.  Each story keeps you hooked and every passing moment you wonder in the end what will happen to these very confused and lost characters. Very good read.   <br /> <br />The reason I gave it three stars is because of it's homosexual content which I could of done without.
0316666343|5.0|Captivating storyline, superb writing style, and extremely intriguing.  This writer was excellent at providing a fresh story with a fresh point of view.  I look forward to reading other works by this author.
B0000AOV85|3.0|Hey, let me level with you guys.  This DVD is a little over priced for what you get.  The running lenght of the main feature is only 45 minutes and there are a couple of specail features that were not even worth remembering. <br /> <br />However, the little bit of documentry you get is very intresting and well worth watching but once you've seen it once you won't want to watch it again.  Use your money for \\"live at pompee\\" because that can be watched over and over and over.
0395951054|2.0|Mein Kampf is interesting to read, not because Hitler is a great writer but because it gives us a glimpse of what went on in the mind of the man. He has some surprisingly shrewd insights but his plans and ambition are pure dementia. It's very political but his plans for the supremacy of the race and destruction of the inferior ones are clearly outlined and the \\"philosophy\\" behind it simply put: basically, the way of Nature is survival of the fittest and Germans will be the fittest and ANY means will be acceptable to that end.<br /><br />I simply CANNOT believe any reviewer who actually read the book could write, as one did: \\"he never suggested the harming of the handicapped, Gypsies or Jews in Mein Kampf, or in any of his writings.\\"<br /><br />You have to be incredibly blind, incredibly obtuse or incredibly hypocritical to not see the writing on the wall in Mein Kampf. But before 1933, I don't think any one could have CONCEIVED of such ideas actually being carried out in practice.
B000002ADT|5.0|I listen to alot of music (and I am not one of the many people that will give five stars to just anything) and my favorite bands range from: Tool, Radiohead, Pink Floyd, Sigur Ros and the grateful dead.  I always knew I would someday get into jazz but I thought it would not happen until latter on in my life and not to mention I had not found a gateway album... until now. <br /> <br />Kind of Blue is what music truly is to me.  With all of the show-off techinal stuff aside I can tell you that, to me, music is the expresion of ones soul.  It is a great force that can either bring a person to the heights of ecstasy or the depths of depression.  When I bought this album the first thing I did, before actually listing to it, was read the notes on the back of the disk and boy are they right when they state that this album is like it was made in heaven.  To keep the review short I will comment on the two most powerful pieces.  The first is \\"So What\\" which opens with a very memorable and creative intro and glides into a nice rythmn that made me shout with musical joy.  I don't understand the techinal aspects of the song (yet) but I do know that it sounds amazing and will be forever locked in your brain.  The best song on the album is \\"Flemence Sketches\\" which, like most things specail to me, took a couple times to really sink in and last night it finnaly hit me.  I was driving home for work at four in the morning and the sax solo brought tears to my eyes.  Incredible... nothing more needs to be said. <br /> <br />IT'S ONLY TEN DOLLARS FOR GOD'S SAKE
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Just a couple corrections.  Eugene's guitar parts were played by Ry Cooder and Steve Vai.  Ry handled all of the delta blues parts, with Vai contributing Eugene's Trick Bag at the end of the film.  Arlen Roth was Ralph Macchio's guitar coach.
B0000A5A0T|4.0|As it turns out, the ultimate blue train edition was not ultimate. I like the RVG remasters, but I can understand why someone wont like them. I like that these remasters are more on the 'bright' side than on the 'warmth' side. I traded my ultimate edition for this and I am happy I did. This is a masterpiece, but I am taking one star because of Blue Note endless list of reissues of the same material.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I am a fifteen year old teenager living in one of the most liberal states in America. However, I tried to view Moore's piece objectively and independently.  <br /> <br />The movie itself was absolutely brilliant, Moore's witty and clever narrative conveys the message that he tries to bring across to his audience with clarity and humor. His choice of startling and sometimes shocking photos and video clips have a raw, truthful, and real-life feel to it.  <br /> <br />One of my favorite scenes was when Bush was given the news regarding the attacks on the twin towers while sitting in a classroom, reading a storybook titled \\"My Pet Goat\\". He sits there for SEVEN MINUTES, unsure of what to do, making faces and looking worried. How did we ever elect this man to be our Commander-in-Chief? <br /> <br />Moore exposes what he calls the \\"lies\\" of our current administration. He depicts how Bush \\"stole\\" the election in Florida, how Bush went into Iraq only for profits and not for the supposed weapons of mass destruction (what, a few hand grenades?), and how Bush's close ties with the Saudi royal family affect American taxpayers. <br /> <br />I would advise everyone to see it first, before making a pre-bias about Moore or the film itself. It definitely raises some interesting issues and questions, and I think that this country needs a \\"regime change\\" as soon as possible to save the integrity and international respect our country used to have.
B000002UAU|4.0|amid the sun-soaked splendour of sequins, buffoonery and studio chicanery something was wrong in the state of the beatles. this is a Christmas Cake of an album with a slightly sickly centre. <br /> <br />this is paul's album. he is the wizard. anyone wishing to dismiss him as a contrite twee has-been should think again. on the basis of this album alone, paul need never to have proved himself in any way, shape or form again. this is a glorious lovesong to english culture, to the musical elite on both sides of the atlantic and to the sheer bliss of creating and playing music in a studio free to give you whatever it can. <br /> <br />and it shines! the chiming peels of the opening chords of 'Getting Better' to the frenetic drumming on Sgnt Pepper's (reprise)  bring us an album overflowing with optimism and bouncy poppy exuberance.  <br /> <br />beneath this slightly conceited appearance however lies a pool of drug misuse and futility.  lennon, though at his peak, was overdrugged on lsd much of the time and was losing his grip a little.  lucy in the sky with diamonds is a wonderful alice in wonderland style jaunt through a cotswoldian wilderness but it gives in to an easy chorus heavy on reverb and a (by the beatles standards) oversimple chord arrangement.   <br /> <br />harrison, bored with all this psychedelia adds cheery guitar and vocals throughout and a great song - perhaps one of the best on the album - and in subject matter ahead of the others in the band. <br /> <br />but where john and paul work well is in the segueing of the album and the songs 'with a little help...' . 'getting better' , 'she's leaving home' and 'a day in the life' - all effortlessly stoned (well, perhaps not she's leaving home) and bewidered and happy at the same time - what a glorious mix. <br /> <br />musically, the drums and bass are awesome. macca's bass woos in a motown sub-section beneath a byrds and beatlesque harmony and the whole effect of the album is of a giant pastel fruit landing merrily in a dreary world coming alive and screaming 'Wake up and smell the psychedelic coffee' <br /> <br />so a good album and one often overhyped with age - not as good as revolver perhaps - it runs out of steam just over half way through with good morning good morning - but well worth a listen really.
0064471837|4.0|The main character- Sabriel, is tired 9/10 of the entire book. Just wanted to point that out.
B000002J0P|5.0|Full of haunting phrases, air-locked harmonies, folksy finger-picking and chiming guitars, this is an album that stands marginally, but significantly, ahead of all its great neighbours from 1969.   <br /> <br />Firstly, you have to admire the candid nature of much of the lyric matter.  The honesty and passion Stills gives to his compositions is moving when you consider that he was essentially a remarkably gifted 24 year old at the time.  he fills this album with his vision, free from the restraints of buffalo springfield.  you can see the influences of freddie neil and the greenwich village scene - 'You don't have to cry', 'Helplessly Hoping'  to subtler influences such as hendrix on suite: judy blue eyes, motown on the backing tracks for pre-road downs and marrakesh express and folk-rock on 49 bye-byes.  the result is an album virtually flawless musically.    <br /> <br />Yet unlike later albums by CSN, the sound is not overproduced. Part of its charm is an earthiness, a bit like on The Band's Music from Big Pink or Nick Drake's Pink Moon. The result is a musical red wine, a lush, deep and absolutely charming album that veers from moments of absolute greatness (suite: judy blue eyes) to moments of touching simplicity (lady of the island). <br /> <br />David Crosby adds a strength to all the compositions in his singing and perhaps unparallelled knowledge of harmonies.  Listening to Jazz ( Coltrane's A Love Supreme etc), Gregorian Chant and 1950s vocal groups (like the young Brian Wilson) and Classical music had given Crosby a vast pad from which he could pull his musical colours. His 'Guinnevere' and 'Wooden Ships' demonstrate his commitment to conjuring up an aural landscape of mystery, sic-fi, escape and rejection. <br /> <br />Graham Nash, perhaps more than Stills and crosby, is the singer who really makes the album gell in the end.  you can practically hear the joy in his voice, the sense that \\"yes, all those years touring on cold european days are behind me andnow i can be free'. 'you don't have to cry' and '49 bye-byes' are made by him.  <br /> <br />but they all come together and make this era-redefining, generation-affirming and musically-gifted masterpiece. from beginnibg to end a very special album - all the better for the innocence and lack of excess when making it - these are three guys high on the joys of life, love and making music!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I've been waiting for this release since  DVD became a reality. Just the thought of DVD quality is a salivating notion. I can't believe the puritanical self-righteous swipes taken at this release due to the fact that it won't be a certain edition relative to the original theatrical release. I was there for the cinematic debut of a New Hope. I knew nothing about it until the trailers on TV, a week before I saw the film. No film experience has affected me as much. BUT...! That was 1977 film tech. DVD is capable of much better quality than could be displayed from the original release. Peter Jackson said that LotR couldn't be made until 2000 FX tech. Lucas made Star Wars upon inspiration with existing tech, and some of his own invention. The fact is... Star Wars is a project in development! <br />And I welcome the opportunity to see Lucas' original concept further developed and refined as film FX develops. I have purchased many of the VHS versions to reflect upon nostalgically. The only advantage to having the pristine original version on DVD is the convenience of DVD over VHS bulk. I have 5 different copies of Army of Darkness on VHS and DVD. Overkill? Consumerism?  <br />\\"Sticks and Stones!\\" I say, bring `em on!  The fact is ... there still hasn't been another Sci-Fi or Fantasy film experience to equal the Star Wars phenom. More versions allow a new rush on an old subject. <br />Bottom line is that the Star Wars product line isn't complete. Surely the \\"Directors cut\\" will be followed by the \\"Fundamentalist cut\\" sometime there after... and I'll be there in line for that too.  <br />Let George finish realizing his vision and let us enjoy the process. <br />This isn't world diplomacy, feeding the hungry or spiritual salvation... its fun!  <br />If you don't want to buy this release... that's OK. Your time will come. have NO DOUBT! <br />So have pity on we who love variations on theme; we're dehydrating from drooling in anticipation. <br />
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot was 0 for 2 with me.  I very much disliked their self titled and Iowa, but for some reason I knew they had great poteintial.  I liked how they seemed to be very crazy but very structured at the same time.  Joey Jordison was (and still is) one of the best drummers I have ever heard.  I respect and look up to him as a fellow drummer.  Now I wished Corey would grow up and quit rapping which is the main reason I hated Slipknot in the past, and to hear him do less rapping (although its still there) and more singing was a breath of fresh air.  I also liked how they went for more complex song structure and added in some very interesting solos.  One standout factor is the members.  There are nine people in the band and each wears a mask and has his own number.  Lets run through them: <br /> <br /> <br />#0 Sid Wilson (Monkey mask)- Turntables: Slipknots DJ.  He is working less than in previous albums, but when he is scratching it adds a nice touch to the song.  Has built up a rivalry with #7 which usually results in violence on stage. <br /> <br />#1 Joey Jordison (white kabuki mask with black markings)- Drums: Joey is easily one of the best drummers I have ever heard.  He is also the shortest member of the band.  His work in The Blister Exists will blow your mind. <br /> <br />#2 Paul Grey (Pig/Hannibal mask)- Bass: You can't really hear him much, but he is very talented.  I don't think he will ever really get to shine in Slipknot and that is a shame. <br /> <br />#3 Chris Fehn (Pinocchio mask)- Custom Percussion: Chris is half of the percussion team along with #7.  Chris has my favorite mask and he is my second favorite member (Joey being my first) <br /> <br />#4 James (Jim) Root (court jester/demon mask)- rhythm guitar: Jim is the one who leads the more chunky metal riffs.  He is also the tallest member at 6'6 <br /> <br />#5 Craig (133) Jones (Hellraiser mask [the one with the nails sticking out])- Sampling: Craig is probably the weirdest member.  When ever his picture is taken he puts duct tape over his eyeholes so people can't find out who he is.  He also leaves concerts early to protect his anonymity. <br /> <br />#6 Shawn Crahan (clown)- Custom Percussion: Clown is the craziest member on stage. He has fractured knuckles, split a collarbone, suffered slipped vertebrae, bruised his pelvic bone, dislocated a shoulder, gotten a concussion, partially severed a finger, and smashed his head often enough to require 22 stitches.  He also has a custom made titanium drumset which produces an interesting sound. <br /> <br />#7 Mick Thompson (Hockey mask)- Lead Guitar: Mick is the one who lets loose the winding solos you hear every once in a while.  he is the second tallest member at 6'2.  He is my third favorite. <br /> <br />#8 Corey Taylor (leather zombie looking thing): Vox- Finally we get to Corey.  He is VERY talented, but I didn't like him before this album.  He sings very well and he also has a powerful scream and occasionally growl. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I also feel a track rundown is necessary.  (you will find some references to the self titled, but none to Iowa because I feel Iowa isn't worthy of being mentioned with Volume 3.  Self titled was at least listenable.) <br /> <br /> <br />Prelude 3.0- This isn't an \\"intro\\" but mainly what it says: a prelude.  Its pretty mellow with some great drumming during the chorus.  Corey does very nice vocals here although not his best on the album.  Perfect start. 10/10 <br /> <br />The blister exists- Powerful.  Very powerful.  Many other words can describe it like brutal, fast, aggressive, relentless.  It also has a very nice drum break in the middle as well as a powerful double bass from Joey.  10/10 <br /> <br />Three nil- Its hard to follow an act like The Blister Exists, but Three Nil manages to do it in its own way.  Not quite as powerful as TBE, but still very powerful.  It is pretty catchy. 10/10 <br /> <br />Duality- Ah yes.  You've all heard it and you all said \\"THISis Slipknot!?!?!\\".  Well yes it is.  Some rapping from Corey, but not nearly as annoying as his previous attempts.  VERY catchy and radio friendly. but still good.  8/10 <br /> <br />Opium of The People- Generic nu metal.  I don't really like it, but the very nice guitar work and solo brings it up at least 5 points.  I also like the \\"I won't give another soul to you\\" part. 7/10 <br /> <br />Circle- The first acoustic track on the album and not too bad.  Some emotional lyrics and an end with a nice beat.  I like.  9/10 <br /> <br />Welcome- Its a great song but I don't find myself listening to it very often.  I am aware there is some magnificent drumming, but I don't really appreciate it like I should.  7/10 <br /> <br />Vermilion- I'm listening to this song right now.  Somewhat disturbing, but it will grow on you and force you to sing along.  Beware.  This song has a creepy atmosphere similar to Prosthetics on their self titled.  Another cool solo also.  I really like this song.  10/10 <br /> <br />Pulse of the Maggots- The most brutal, powerful, and aggressive song on the CD.  This will undoubtedly be a concert favorite.  It will get you moving. Kickin solo, too 10/10 <br /> <br />Before I forget- Probably the best song Slipknot has ever done.  Words cannot describe this song, and after you hear it you will be speechless.  Truly beautiful.  15/10 <br /> <br />Vermilion pt. 2- This is the best acoustic song on the CD (and there are 3).  Its just as moody as Vermilion minus the heaviness.  Corey really showcases his extreme talent here.  After you listen to this song, it will be very hard for you to say Corey has no talent.  Some great backup vocals either. <br /> <br />The Nameless-  It fails to follow Vermilion in a powerful way, but still a haunting song.  Its obvious that as the CD draws to an end the songs get more and more haunting.  8/10 <br /> <br />The Virus of Life- This is the Scissors of Volume 3. Very emotional ending leading into the closer.  10/10 <br/> <br />Danger- Keepaway- Wow.  Words do not describe it.  It is... just not what a Slipknot fan would expect unless you've heard the rest of the album first.  If you listen to the whole album on your first try you will appreciate this very much.  Otherwise it won't seem as spectacular as it really is.  Slipknot really couldn't have closed the album in any other way.  15/10 <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is definitely worth a try.  WAAAAAY better than their last release.  I look forward to Slipknot next CD although its possible that this is it, and I'm very sad if it is because I never got to experience Slipknot live.

0141301104|5.0|Oh, this book. It's one of the scariest books I've read, and I read it a long time ago. Much like the incredible The Thing movie, I thought that its power would diminish with age.. but having recently seen the Thing, and read Witches, I can say that I was wrong on both counts.<br /><br />It's a scary book, and the humor is the kind of humor that you might get from watching a drowning man fumbling for a stick to keep afloat in a raging whirlpool. In other words, you laugh because laughing is all you can do when you're helpless against the events that are transpiring beneath your nose.<br /><br />And oh, the noses those witches have... long, and curved, and able to smell a dirty child from yards away. The suspense that Dahl builds is incredible - when our protaganist is hiding, hoping that his unwashed body will not attract their attention... *shivers.*<br /><br />I've never seen the movie, and have no desire to.. the book is strong enough. The talk of a mouse's lifespan, the implications for the protaganist... looking back, re-reading this book, I have to say that it's one of my favorite books ever, not just my favorite Dahl ever.
0812548094|4.0|WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS: <br /> <br />If you're looking for a breather from important stuff and just want something \\"fun\\" to read, look no further. No reason that you must read Wizard's First Rule first, just buy this one and dive right in. It's quite self-contained. It has the advantage over the Wheel of Time books in that it is self-contained and does not take hundreds of pages reiterating prior events. For those people who delight in reading action-oriented tales in the vein of Dragonlance, early Shannara works, and others then this is a book in which you will delight.  <br /> <br />WHY YOU SHOULD PASS: <br /> <br />There is quite a bit of violence here as well as a bit of sex. Nothing that kids won't find on the sci-fi channel, but the descriptions are rather more brutal than customary and give a flavor of realism that will give people pause. Maybe keep away from soft-hearted or very young children (maybe also away from children you've noticed tormenting small animals). If you are looking to read a book that will seriously change how you look at the world, pass. You will not find that kind of writing here. This is, as sfreviews.com pointed out, pure (but good) escapism.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Introduced to him in May 2003 by a friend who gave me a sampler of 4 of his songs, I've been hooked since. I've seen (and met him!!!)him in concert at the Chicago House of Blues in August of 2003 (and he gave me the vapors) and then at a in-store performace in November at Borders Books and Music.     I love this guy. I love this album and it bums me that his sales have not been stronger and that his record company resorted to this new format to help boost sales. I wished he put out another album or an EP of new material. 1 new song is not worth another purchase (I have three copies of the first anyway).    While One Tree Hill TV show might help him a bit, we as fans, have to convice the rest of the world that talented singer/songwriters like him, Rufus Wainwrite, jasom Mraz, Ari Hest and Edie Brickell need to be promoted more than the lastest re-tred from Brittney Spears and Jessica Simpson.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I am currently awaiting this motion picture's release on DVD.  I have reservations on movies being made about the Lord Jesus Christ.  All the \\"Jesus\\" movies ever made have been sanitized I believe, with clean, groomed and very much unlooking of people who lived in those lands.  Plus, these movies have been \\"cheesy\\" as well.  I can think of no better word.  Also, how can men begin to capture the glory of Christ, the magnitude of His work (dying so that sinful man can be reconciled to God) and the weight and splendor of His resurrection in a movie?  Mel Gibson has certainly broken free of the old Bible epics on film, and I believe finally made a movie that comes close to capturing the power (and humanity, Jesus was both God and man) of Christ. <br /> <br />I will address the movie both theologically (as a Christian) and cinematically (as a movie lover).  Theologically, Gibson has pulled no punches.  He hasn't crafted a \\"world friendly\\" movie.  That is, as a Christian, Gibson isn't shaking hands with the world in compromise.  He believes it when Christ said, \\"I am the way, the truth and the life.\\" (John 14:6)  While Gibson did include some extra-Biblical things such as Satan's presence in the garden, the \\"demon children\\" (watch the movie) and Jesus' playfully hanging out with His mother for example, I still wasn't troubled.  Gibson remained faithful to the four Gospels.  True, you must know your Bible and the Gospels to follow this film.  For anyone who is a Christian, he or she should have no trouble knowing what is going on at a given time.  If you watch this movie and are totally confused, I hope you would take up a Bible and read. <br /> <br />Cinematically, this movie is nearly a masterpiece.  It was shot near perfection.  The use of color, close-ups and slow motion shots are amazing.  Jim Caviezel does an incredible job, as does all the cast.  The score to the movie is haunting.  From the opening haunting scene in the garden where Christ is in anguish, Gibson hadme.  As a fellow Christian, I thought, \\"Finally someone has come close to getting it right.\\" <br /> <br />The accusations of this movie being anti-Sematic are unfounded.  Many critics have said Gibson rubs are noses in the gore and violence of this film.  The passion of Christ had to have been gory folks, and I grant you, crucifixion was violent and bloody.  Make no mistake, the film is violent beyond compare, but Gibson has captured what it must had been like.  This film is for the mature viewer, certainly.  I can't question all of Gibson's motives.  I pray he sincerely has done this as evangelism, to show the enormity of Christ sacrifice for us who will come to Him.   <br /> <br />Whether you embrace the Christian message of redemption or not, there is no denying the fact this is a powerful movie.
B0000524CY|5.0|I just saw The Exorcist for the first time last night and I loved it.  This is a classic Horror movie with all of the right elements.  This movie shines in the character development of all the major players. We see the gradual decline of the characters metal state as the movie goes on.  The Exorcist forgos grossness (there is still plenty of that!) and becomes a more crebal horror movie that will numb your mind.  This movie is best viewed in the dark around mid-night , the witching hour, to get the full effect.  Beprepared to sleep with the lights on long after viewing this movie.  Remember horror fans expecteding a slasher movie will be dissapointed. <br /> <br />P.S I live only an hour away from the real place were the real life possenion took place!!

But, that doesn't mean I don't like them (I do agree, however, that \\"St. Anger\\" is not there best album). I haven't seen any other band on the planet give as much access & freedom (that includes the Beatles) to a project like this and the results are raw, but,at the same time, mixed. Hetfield, at the film's premiere, said that some of the scenes in the film were tough to watch.<br /><br />These boys have been together since their high school days (if they went to school at all. I'm not sure). The rules the band laid down in the 80's were still solid and in action at the time they started going to therapy. Basic rule being - not to critique one another on their playing or lyric writing (there facial feature reaction to there manager's negative opinion of some of the stuff for the new album is priceless).<br /><br />The bad side is the film is quite long (at a run time of 2hrs. and 20 min., I started to dose during some of the slower spots). Rumor had it that this was orignally going to be either an ongoing televison reality series like \\"The Osbournes\\" or at least a reality mini-series for \\"The Independant Film Channel\\" or \\"MTV\\" (like we really need another one of these!).<br /><br />With the band having the final say for all things \\"Metallica\\", the boys decided to release the footage as a feature length documentary. That's where the other problem comes in. The film itself is in the 4:3 aspect ratio thats appropriate for the regular televison format. When its blown up on the big screen it still has that TV feel to it, with the image not being able to use full advantage of the theatre's widescreen. The film is also shot on video and when blown up on the screen it has a lot of unavoidable grain to it (much like \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" had).<br /><br />As far as \\"Metallica\\" losing money over \\"Some Kind of Monster\\",  that won't happen.

B0000508U6|5.0|With 10 mystic and melodic alternative compositions, Coldplay's debut album \\"Parachutes\\" is without a doubt an album that should be in everyone's car deck rotation.  Compassionate lyrics, soft guitar strums and gentle chorded ivories are just a several elements which labels this album as genuine, contentful and beautiful.  Any avid alternative fan should already have \\"Parachutes,\\" a needed part of anyone's collection.
B00004RD54|5.0|Lou Reed fans remain divided over this one and even Reed himself reportedly declared a strong opinion (against) its artistic validity. Yet it remains amongst Reed's most celebrated and controversial albums.   The reason for this is obvious, or at least it is obvious to any musician listening to it - \\"its the BAND man\\". The rhythm section is a decade ahead of its time, Prakash John blazing a path on bass that many rock (and more than a few jazz) artists were to follow. The arrangements are precisely thought through and well rehearsed, this outfit was tight, and the set is presented as it was performed, with no overdubs [edit 2008: having transcribed the Intro (Sweet Jane) I now believe there to three, perhaps four, guitar parts in this piece, suggesting overdubs to the track].  On guitars hired gun master musicians Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner (also credit Wagner for most of the arrangements) kick Reed's Velvet Underground material into a space Reed possibly hadn't totally prepared himself for. This is pure rock, high voltage rock , raw, totally-controlled-yet-live rock and roll. The terms glam-rock and heavy-metal are simply inapplicable.  The band aside, Reed's contribution is also superb, even powerful, despite his less than prominent level within the mix. Regardless of the contentions of some critics this isn't Lou Reed plus an overpowering backing band, it's a cohesive and sonically democratic ensemble. Whoever originally mixed this concert also understood this essential fact.  It will persist as one of the era's finest live rock recordings.
B000002H6C|5.0|This CD marks Metallicas entrence into the mainstream before the classic 'Black Album' and after the heavy 'Master of Puppets'. Commercialing does not lie here, although 'Black Album' sold in excess of 15 million copies (holy s**t!) this album sold four million within its first year. <br />   The reason why this album sold so much is due to three great songs (possibly some of the greatest Metallica songs) of the eighties. These songs were: <br /> <br />1. One- (ironic), this song is about a soldier after a war and the pain he feels. This is expressed through the softer verses and very heavy choruses. Very complex as this song just keeps getting faster and faster until it reaches the second extremely talented guitar solo (about six minutes into the song). One of Metallica's finest pieces. <br /> <br />2. Eye of the Beholder - A song about someone asking someone else if they have anything in common with them and then giving them some freedom. One of the greatest guitar riffs James Hetfield has ever made serves as the foundation for two of the most different yet talented guitar solos I've ever heard from Kirk Hammett. <br /> <br />3. Harvester of Sorrow - Pure greatness although not as good as the previous two. This was the last single released off of this album and the reason why this album sold two million more copies after the previous singles.  <br /> <br />   There are other great songs on this album no doubt, but I don't have time (or energy) to get into a word by word thesis although I will say tracks 1, 2 and 5 are great and tracks 7-9 are okay. <br />   This is also the first album with bassist Jason Newsted and although he was no Cliff Burton he still was great, the problem is the production was so crappy that you can't even hear Jasons bass playing. If you are metalhead then buy this, even if you are a punk (in which case you suck) then buy this.
B0000017CA|5.0|Whoever said the lead singer sounds like the guy from creed is horribly retarded.  First off they don't sound anything alike and second creed started releasing music after this band's demise, which would make creed sound like acid bath not the other way around. <br /> <br />Well anyways, this is a superb cd.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Why see it? Great actors, great wardrobe, great gun fights, great city, nice story and a really, really badass main character that cancels all emotions when he starts kicking ass. <br />The 4 stars are because at some moments it looks like an Apple TV commercial, and that's just plain dumb...and because he decides to kill 10 fellow humans for doing their job over the life of a Puppy...and that is also dumb. <br />Don't compare it.

1400032717|5.0|I can't recommend this book highly enough.     To be honest, if you have absolutely no interest in or curiosity about autism, it might require some effort; it's a little like reading about the Martians among us, from a Martian's point of view.      I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in writing that presents windows into other ways of thought.  And as a lover of good literature, whose opinion is colored by experience with kids \\"on the spectrum\\", I'm very, very glad to see it on book club and bestseller lists.    Mark Haddon's well-written, sympathetic and wise view of both worlds (autistic and \\"normal\\"), makes this a book that has real social merit.
B00005JN2X|2.0|As I was standing in a rather long line stretching a good length of a big city block outside the theater ticket window, in seeing all the usual casually-clad people lined up to purchase movie tickets, I thought to myself: \\"Most of these people are probably going to see either 'The Manchurian Candidate' or 'Collateral'\\". To be honest, my gut instinct was telling me to purchase a ticket for the former feature. As I reached the ticket window, I inquired to the vendor about a brief synopsis to both films. Upon this vendor's cut-to-the-quick explanation of \\"Collateral\\"'s storyline centering on a kidnapping, hostage situation of sorts, I decided this was the movie I wanted to see, since I thought this type of picture would not disappoint, and deliver a lot of intrigue and physical punch in the process, which these blackmail and espionage style thrillers usually endow upon the viewer. So, after sitting through \\"Collateral\\" for over two hours, I wished I had gone with my first instinct. Featuring a mostly ill-conceived, slipshod plot, combined with an unbelievable, confusing storyline, \\"Collateral\\" stumbles out of the gate, trips up throughout most of the picture, and burns and crashes at the end. To make matters worse, it appears that the overall storyline was written and prepared by a bunch of hung-over, illiterate high-schoolers, which explains Jamie Foxx's character's largely incoherent rambling that rolls throughout most of the movie. As for Tom Cruise's character, it seems that the producers tried to make him into a hybrid between two Clint Eastwood heroes: Dirty Harry and The Outlaw Josey Wales. Adding insult to injury, seeing that Cruise wants to be the ultimate S.O.B. tough guy, and just when one thinks a \\"Go ahead punk, MAKE MY DAY!\\"-type moment will sound from Mr. Cruise's lips, he appears both hesitant and tentative in his execution. When the above verbatim becomes affirmative, it is echoed with a trite and forceful resonance that is likely to make one stand up out of their seat and yell: \\"Blasphemy! Sheer, heaped to the hilt - BLASPHEMY!\\". Seeing that Jamie Foxx is a comedian/comedy actor and not a straight, serious actor doesn't help matters, either. In fact, Foxx's preschool drivel only makes the proceedings excruciatingly worse, leaving himself to wonder what a castastrophic mess he had gotten himself into. Jada Pinkett Smith's appearance is by far the best of the three main actors here, all the moreso making laughingstocks out of both Cruise's and Foxx's subpar performances singlehandedly. With such a high-profile, superstar cast and a supposedly high-octane, fast-paced plot, I thought forking over my hard-earned cash in exchange for a thin, glossy cardboard paper ticket stub as a permanent sort of 'temporary' \\"Collateral\\", would yield a nice return to satisfy my entertainment pleasure. I also thought I'd be \\"investing\\" in some big time dividends as a result. As it turned out, I was taken in by a big publicity sham, and received merely a peanut from my so-called \\"investment\\". It is wise not to waste your precious time or money giving any ounce of attention to a film that truly doesn't deserve it. Avoid forking over any type of \\"Collateral\\" for this dreck at all costs, and view another feature instead. Definitely not recommended.out of their seat and yell: \\"Blasphemy!

Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn are in fine form, and Jeremy Piven is positively evil incarnate as the Dean.

0064407667|2.0|Really 2.5 stars.  Or 2.75.  It's a rather average series, thus far (I've gotten to the third book).  For children, it is probably a very helpful didactic tool regarding vocabulary building and, of course, anything that gets kids away from their Game Boys is a bonus.  However, the series isn't nearly as funny as a Roald Dahl book, nor as clever & involved as a Harry Potter book. It's rather a shame that all of the adult characters are so horribly unreliable & irresponsible (excepting the few who are downright evil & the Judge Strauss character, who is the only positive adult role model as far as I can see).     The series seemed to pick up at the third installment, so I may revise my opinion as the time goes on.  However, regarding the first three volumes, they are unrelentingly average. Much better to read \\"James & the Giant Peach\\" - with its unceasingly clever dialogue, yet horribly nasty grown-ups (if you're into that) or any of Dahl's other books.  Or, if you want to be really traditional, go fo Harry Potter - there's nothing like Rowling for any age group.

B000063DHL|5.0|Somewhere in Time is my favorite album from the best band to ever come out of England. This was a very hard choice to make as Powerslave, Brave New World, and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son came very close.  Iron Maiden have amazed me with their incredible talent and ability to use different elements in their music.  Bruce Dickenson has a great vocal range, and it shows on this album.<br /><br />The album starts off with the title track, which introduced guitar synth from the leads.  This was a risky move by Maiden, but in my opinion, it worked perfectly.  The track, Wasted Years is a good song and I like the chorus.  The song, Heaven can Wait is the catchiest song off of this album, and will be in your head for days!!  (this is not a bad thing) I love the part in the middle of the song the best.  The 2 best songs on this cd are, Stranger in a Strange Land, and Alexander the Great!  Both of these songs are worthy for a spot on a greatest hits list.  The vocals on 'Alexander' are nothing less than amazing, and the guitar soloists are at their best on 'Stranger.'<br /><br />This cd was a great follow-up to Powerslave, and Iron Maiden continue to stick to their roots even today, with their newest release, titled 'Dance of Death.'  I urge all Iron Maiden fans to pay the extra money to see this band live.  Trust me, they are worth it!  Bruce and the rest of their original linup from 'Number of the Beast' are the best!  I saw them live in Los Angeles, CA for their Dance of Death tour.  Please buy their albums, and if Maiden comes close to your city, their live performance is one NOT to be missed.  UP THE IRONS!!

0345457684|5.0|The impressive creativity of author Richard Morgan is readily apparent in his intricate fabrication of futuristic society in his sci-fi techno thriller \\"Altered Carbon\\".<br /><br />Set in the 25th century, mankind has colonized parts of the galaxy under the guidance of the U.N.  Technology has advanced to the point where death is a vastly different entity than it once was.  The essence of humans is stored in the \\"cortical stack\\" a receptacle imbedded at the base of the skull.  The cortical stack could be stored and then inserted within a wide range of different bodies called sleeves.  This represents the ultimate separation of body and soul.  Punishment for criminal acts would result in storage for terms according to the severity of the crime.<br /><br />One such stored individual was Takeshi Kovacs, an ex-U.N. envoy. a chemically enhanced and genetically altered super soldier.  Kovacs, a resident of Harlan's World, a planet some 188 light years from Earth was interred there.  After about 4 years of his sentence, he was needlecast downloaded (transported) to Bay City, formerly San Francisco at the behest of a Laurens Bancroft.  Bancroft was a wealthy CEO of Psycha-sec, a huge genetics based corporation.  Bancroft was known as a Meth, short for Methusaleh, or an aged one.  He had been resleeved many times and was now in excess of 300 years old.  He had officially committed suicide but insisted that he had been murdered.  This was essentially a moot point in that his cortical stack had been resleeved into another body he kept in a storage facility.  Kovacs was paid for and released by Bancroft to investigate for proof that a murder was actually committed.  His reward would result in his freedom and extensive monetary considerations.<br /><br />Kovacs working in a sleeve of a discredited former hot shot Bay City policeman proceeds to uncover clues to solve the crime while surrounded by an unfriendly and uncooperative environment.<br /><br />Morgan's prose is extremely thought provoking but at times confusing.  He should consider introducing a glossary of terms to avoid have to return to previously read pages for clarification.  For an initial offering \\"Altered Carbon\\" sets a very lofty standard for Morgan to attain with his subsequent novels.tremely thought provoking but at times confusing.

B00000JRTX|4.0|This is definitely a film that can be watched over and over again, with a very talented cast of British actors.  James Fleet's Tom actually elicits more laughs from me than Hugh Grant's Charles.  Andie Macdowell has definitely earned the enmity of fans of this British comedy everywhere for the apparent coldness of her character (\\"Hey, aren't the English supposed to be the cold fish?\\").  But Carrie, I believe, is the kind of woman who would sleep with another and still manage to mercilessly seduce and befriend everyone in her way.   <br />The movie, as a now cult hit, is curious in some ways.  The film never explicitly states what Charles' job is. But there are two clues which should not be ignored.  It seems that he is a writer or scholar of some sort, who deals with word origins and etymologies. 1) When he asks Tom to stop the car after the first wedding, he claims he wants to go to the inn \\"The Lucky Boatman\\" because \\"he is looking at English inns or pubs that have 'boat' in their title\\" (not an exact quote). 2) The second clue is given during the -ahem- amorous scene between Charles and Carrie that same night. Andie Macdowell asks Charles where he thinks the word \\"honeymoon\\" comes from, and he replies that it's honey because it's sweet, and moon because that would be the first time a husband would see his wife's bottom. <br />As for the other characters, Tom and Fiona are of course landed gentry (notice the Farmer's Weekly magazine on Tom's little table when he wakes up in the morning in the first scenes of the movie). Scarlett says she's after a job as a sales assistant at a place called \\"Spank\\" that sells rubber products (this is when Charles gets the invitation to Carrie's wedding). I have no clue as to what Gareth or Matthew do, but perhaps they are academics, although Gareth's funeral takes place near a factory. <br />I've always wondered what appointment Charles makes his brother David miss while Carrie is recounting her sexual experiences in the caf.  Thebuilding in the film does not look like a hospital or a bank.     <br />Previous reviewers state that Charles and Scarlett are siblings.  No indication of this is given in the movie; they are simply \\"flatmates.\\"  But Charles and David are of course brothers, and Charles refers to his father's funeral more than once.       <br />
B000050HTO|3.0|Whether or not you agree with the compilers' choice of songs is obviously a question of taste, and very subjective, too. And I'm sure that a lot of people will think that this collection is all good and fine, but despite the high quality of almost every song, I still believe a significantly better \\"essential\\" collection could have been made - and has been made, too.    First of all, this is obviously a collection for relative newcomers rather than seasoned Dylan-fans. Second of all, those newcomers should stick to the original \\"Greatest Hits\\" and \\"More Greatest Hits\\" for the 60s and early 70s material, and hand-pick the best of Dylan's later releases for the rest of his most important output.  There are just too many of Bob Dylan's best songs missing here, especially from the 70s and 90s. \\"Blood On The Tracks\\" is represented by only two songs, \\"Desire\\" is (mis-)represented only by \\"Hurricane\\"...and if non-album classics like \\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\\" and \\"Watching The River Flow\\" shouldn't be on a supposed \\"essential\\" collection, where should they be?    The compilers have opted for songs like \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\", \\"Silvio\\", \\"Everything Is Broken\\" and \\"Tight Connection To My Heart\\", and they are certainly not bad songs, but they could have done much better.  Leave this album alone, and go get the original Bob Dylan compilations, 1967's \\"Greatest Hits\\" and 1972's \\"Greatest Hits volume 2\\" - the one with 21 tracks on two CDs, leading off with \\"Watching The River Flow\\" on disc 1. Or pick up the classic albums \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\", and \\"Blood On The Tracks\\". Those will get you turned on to Bob Dylan much better than this good-but-not-great attempt at making a definitive Dylan compilation.
0553573411|1.0|I've read a good amount of fantasy and I've never come across a book that was as grotesquely misnamed as this one.  I read Assassin's Apprentice and it was a decent read but still too long at 435 pages.  Do yourself a favor if you read also read it: STOP THERE!!  Royal Assassin is 675 pages and I would think that a royal \\"assassin\\" would have a hell of a lot more confidence in himself and his own decision making ability and also would have assassinated someone well before page 550 but that just isn't the case with this book.  When he does finally kill his first victim in the book, it is a lowly guard who is in his way and the author never really says that the guard actually dies, only that he was very incapacitated and might die.  The next time the Royal Assassin kills anyone is nearly 75 pages later and he simply goes on a rampage of killing, not any kind of sneaky assassination.  I think Miss Hobb needs to learn to develop her plots a lot faster, with less talk.  And if the payoff for sludging through 675 pages in her books is always as week as this one was, I wouldn't recommend any of her books to anyone.  I started the 3rd book, Assassin's Quest, (only because I already owned it) and was planning on using it as speed reading practice.  From what I've read so far, Ms. Hobb seems to be using the dialog in Assassin's Quest to explain away all the faults with the second book.  Save yourself some time and money and, if you really must know what happens in this book, go to the Book-a-Minute web site and read what they wrote about this one.  It is very accurate.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums I've ever listend to.  The riffs, the speeds, the lyrics, all the elements of a good metal album come in one in this Metallica masterpiece.  The opening song \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\" is probably my favorite song on the album.  The first time I heard it I couldn't stop listening to it.  Finally I moved on to other tracks, such as For Whom the Bell Tolls, Creeping Death, and Ride the Lightning, and again I was amazed by the genius display of material.  Also, the new and different aim of music Metallica took wtih Fade to Black, with it's mesterious, suicidal sound was definatly a plus for this album and is looked at as a classic in the eys of Metallica fans.  I am also a lover of instrumental jam sessions and The Call of Ktulu is another favorite of mine.  All in all, this album has it all.  If your a lover of speed, thrash, and pure heaviness, listen to this one!!
630460288X|4.0|I just rented this film from NetFlix, and it must be a different version than what some people here have reported receiving, because it does have the commentary by director Marco Brambilla and producer Joel Silver, and the actors still say \\"Taco Bell\\" in it. This appears to be what Amazon is advertising, but not delivering. Why would they go back later and edit out the name of a company, only to replace it with another name which is also owned by the same people? (Pepsi owns Taco Bell and Pizza Hut.) And did they do the commentary over without Silver, or just cut him out? It doesn't seem like it would make much sense with only one of them talking.
B00005JN2F|3.0|I never saw the first movie.  I only saw this because it was the only movie playing at the time I went to the theatre.  It was a good movie, but the talking/dialogue could have been improved.  If my review was only based on action, it would have been 5 stars, but my review is based on the whole movie.  In my theatre the sound went off for about 5 minutes because of something to do with Hurricane Charlie, and the movie didn't really miss much because there was no talking for that whole time.   <br /> <br />The action scenes were great.  The cuts were really good.  The use of a hand held camera was overdone though.  There was also great montages that fit in with the music perfectly in some scenes.   <br /> <br />This movie could be better, but is still very watchable.
B000059H98|4.0|Its like Rocky Horror meets every comic book cliche ever! Loveable and zany charecters, cartoonish and rediculous turn of events, horrible special effects (that only make the movie more hilarious), rediculous acting so cliche that itll make you laugh even if its outa sheer joy or humiliation that your watching it, underdeveloped yet interesting plot.  For a good happy movie thatll just make you smile, get it! <br /> <br />I was throughly entertained for 90 minutes and thats what matters!  <br /> <br />If your not a fan of cult movies or of comic books, then dont get it. -Only reason i wouldnt give it 5 stars is that it doesnt appeal to many people. <br />
B00000DG1R|5.0|If you grew up with Duran Duran as I did then you really need to have this in your collection. <br /> <br />There is a lot of 80's music that doesnt stand the test of time but Duran Duran is an exception. When you listen to the songs on this cd you realize just how great they really were! I can go weeks with this in my cd and love listening to it over and over.  <br /> <br />This is a great compliation as well spanning almost 20 years of music. Every track on here is a treat for the ears!
B0001ZX0PG|3.0|Powerhouse performances by a skilled cast should keep most viewers riveted to Clint Eastwood's otherwise overlong and somewhat predictable neo-noir. The story of three childhood pals who suffer symbiotic personal traumas both as children and later as adults recalls classic noirs like \\"Out Of The Past\\" and \\"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers\\". Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Hardin and Laura Linney inject the film with much more life than the workmanlike script deserves, and these fine actors are well worth spending the time with. We have become accustomed to Eastwood the director's character-driven, leisurely-paced and deliberate way of making films; with certain efforts it has worked beautifully (\\"Unforgiven\\" and \\"Bird\\" come to mind)-but this time out, Clint should have pulled in the reins a bit tighter. What you end up with is an extended episode of TV's \\"Homicide\\"; basically a standard police procedural with better-than-average acting. Worth a look on cable or as a rental, but it would be tough going to sit through this one more than once.
0446608955|3.0|This is an ok book, not great but also not awful. Its a quick read which is good because if it was any longer I would have hated it. <br /> <br />Im not really sure what so many people like about Nicholas Sparks' books, they are predicatable, sappy and a little boring. There must be a lot of young girls reading them. <br /> <br />This story wont hold any surprises and you wont cry very much if at all like it warns you in the beginnnig. I read this while I was pregnant and very emotional and it only made me mildly watery eyed. <br /> <br />That said its still not a bad book. Just not a great one.
B00008EY65|1.0|Can't believe I wasted time watching this schlock! The commercial was intriguing, and that was what brought me in. When will I learn? Cheap, and I mean CHEAP special effects, and the thinnest (literally a comic book) script. For action you can do better, and for special effects there's much better done before and after. Stay away from this waste of intelligence, money and time.
B000003TAB|4.0|This isn't a really essential CD if you are just a casual fan of Nirvana. This CD mixes songs sounding like something of the Nevermind album and the Bleach album. It isn't a great CD but if you want to hear some of their grungier tracks then have a listen to this. I will break the songs down for you.    BEST TRACKS:    Sliver - One of the more popular from this album. Really rocky track and it's been one of my favourite Nirvana songs for a while. Maybe slightly repetative at the end though. 5/5    Molly's lips - This has the sound of the Nevermind album mixed with a really pop-rock sound too. A very catchy track. 5/5    Son of the gun - This song could be my favourite off the album - It has very similar guitar riffs to \\"Molly's lips\\" and it's, again, catchy.    Aneurysm - This takes a while to start off. It kinda has a grungy Nevermind sound to it. Very cool. 5/5    DECENT TRACKS (most of the songs are in this section):    Dive - A hard but slow song, but it does slightly get boring after a while. 3.5/5    Stain - This is very similar to \\"Dive\\" but it's slightly worse. 3/5    Been a son - Same sort of riffs as \\"Stain\\". This track is OK, but it's too short. 4/5    Tunaround - A really just think this is a comedy song. Kurt doesn't sing it, he speaks. 3.5/5    Polly (new wave) - A prefer the acoustic version. The backing for this song is kinda irratating. 3.5/5    Downer - Can also be found on the Bleach album. I don't mind this song, but again it's too short. 4/5    Aero Zeppelin - Everyone likes this one, but it's not really a favourite of mine. The song has more guitar riffs then singing. But the riffs are quite good. 3.5/5    Big long now -  Quite a long track, that does get slightly boring after a while. But I don't mind this one either. 4/5    BAD TRACKS -     Besswax - To me, this song is just really noisy and Kurt's voice songs really horrible. Very grungy track. 1.5/5    Mexican seafood - The same sound as \\"Beezwax\\". This isn't as noisy and annoying as \\"Beezwax\\" but it still sounds pretty terrible. 2/5    Hairspray queen - I just never have paid attention to this song. 1.5/5    So, I'd get this after you have bought their other official albums. Do not start collecting Nirvana with this CD. I recommend \\"Bleach\\" if you like this one.

B000002HMH|4.0|While alot of people bash on metallica for this album because it doesn't give you \\"thrash\\" or \\"metal up your ass\\" who cares. It really is a rocking album.<br /><br />I wonder when it became the fan's choice it what the music was about, because clearly they went a way no one liked, but they enjoyed writing.<br /><br />I write music of all sorts. As a musician you write the way you want to get the song across as. For instance, Mama Said. This was a song originally just a song that James played to himself after his mother died. It was a personal song, made impersonal my this album. People hated them for it cause they thought they were going for country. WTF guys? How in the hell does this song make sense with bleedingly fast riffs? It doesnt, but thats exactly the point with this album.<br /><br />It fuses their talent with what they wanted to write. No song in particular was designed because of the fan, and I admire that. I don't write music for the fans, I write music because it is what I want to write, and clearly the reveiws as of late on this album proved everyone thinks in backwards direction.<br /><br />This album, Re-load, and St. Anger all provide adequate music to listen to. While they aren't uber fast, or face melting in solos everwhere, they are good. Ask yourself, Does Kill em all sound like Ride the Lightening? Does Ride sound like Master? No, and as a true \\"fan\\" of the music you should realize this. They were all different, and good for only one reason, because they can write music.<br /><br />Load befalled the same fate that alot of bands/albums are subject to. While all the head banging talentless sissies are running around saying Metallicas new albums suck, a new generation hears this, eats it up easily and then it passes around becomming everyones say so.<br /><br />People still eat slayer up, and their new album. Even though it sounds nothing like their older stuff. No one said anything derogitory about it, not the media anyway, especially because the media doesnt touch on slayer. They do on metallica and make that album a media blunder.<br /><br />Honestly, If you want to hear good music, and make a judgment for yourself, they have sound clips. And in my opinion, Hetfeild, Hammet, Jason/Rob and Lars do a fine job writing the music, and even continued to to write music the way they want to, which is the way it should be done. Enjoy it I say, for it is a musical masterpeice in its own ways.ly because the media doesnt touch on slayer.

B000286RKW|5.0|This is, simply put, the best movie ever made.  It's well over 2 hours long, but ends way too soon.  The Godfather is a great movie, but falls short of GOODFELLAS.  Congratulations to whomever decided to put out this special edition DVD.  The initial DVD did not do this movie justice.   <br /> <br />Also, shame on the Academy for not giving this movie Best Picture in 1990.  Dances with Wolves was good, but come on.  And how did Scorcese not win Best Director?  Does direction get any better?  Let's hope he continues to make great movies and gets the recognition that he deserves with an Oscar win!.   <br /> <br />
B0000TLA9G|2.0|This album should have been a double disc. How can Estranged, Rocket Queen, Dead Horse, Coma, Out to Get Me, and many, many others not be included. Anyone who just wants to buy a \\"Greatest Hits\\" album from GNR would be be completely shafted. You'd be better off buying all the albums except of course Speghetti Incident.
B000002J09|4.0|This here is the best selling heavy metal album of all time, or so say the people. I wouldn't really call this style of music heavy metal. More like hard rock. Led Zeppelin was a metal band in the 60's, and on their 1976 album Presence, but I don't understand how people can call 'Stairway To Heaven' metal. This album was very influential, influencing hundreds of bands in the 70's, 80's, and even 90's. Robert Plant's fascination with LOTR-esque mytsicism is more prominent on this album then it was on any of the albums before. For example, in 'Battle Of Evermore' he goes singing those mystical lyrics with that little lute thing or whatever it is going on in the background. Overall, this is a great album, but it is NOT heavy metal.
B000286RKW|5.0|DVD addicts, REJOICE!!!! It's finally here. We've been waiting for this Special Edition for how long and we finally got our wish. Goodfellas has to got to be the grand-daddy of all gangster flicks (well, besides the Godfather). Anyways, that flipper deal that they had when they first released it was so annoying especially since the movie wasn't long enough in my opinion for two sides. But it was released when DVDs were fairly new so I guess it's forgivable. Oh yeh, the acting, directing, writing, period music, and everything else is terrific. This has got to be the greatest film ever made. Can't wait for my copy to arrive!!! Buy it!!!!
B00005ABX0|5.0|With the upcoming release of a rerecorded SMiLE album by Brian Wilson I'm hoping that Capitol Records will finally release a SMiLE box set with all the missing pieces left off the GOOD VIBRATIONS box set. <br /> <br />Pieces missing are \\"Barnyard,\\" \\"The Old Master Painter/You Are My Sunshine,\\" \\"Look (Song For Children),\\" \\"Child Is Father Of The Man,\\" \\"I'm In Great Shape,\\" \\"I Wanna Be Around/Friday Night (Woodshop)\\", \\"Holidays (On A Holiday),\\" and \\"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow (Fire).\\" Also an unedited \\"Surf's Up (Demo)\\" and \\"Heroes And Villains (Intro)\\" please. <br /> <br />So Capitol Records, cash in on this project please!
0743490304|2.0|As the title implies, this a story about deception, and as you can probably guess, it's politicians that are doing the deceiving.  Go figure.  The issue at hand is a mysterious space rock that is found deep under the ice of the North Pole by a brand new NASA satellite conducting a scan of the region.  But things are not always as they seem, and the characters find themselves constantly having to escape death as they begin to uncover the truth about how the rock got there.<br /><br />Brown's novels are characteristically fast paced page-turners, and Deception Point is no exception.  There are a few major annoyances I had with this one though, such as when a handful of scientists outrun the USA's elite Delta Force team in the wide open arctic tundra, then are rescued when one of the scientists taps on a piece of ice and magically alerts a secret oceanic listening device to their location.  Entertaining, but it will probably cause you to groan in skepticism - especially when later on in the story, one of the characters urinates on himself to avoid being detected by a school of man-eating sharks.  Yeah- it does get that bad.<br /><br />The storyline is pretty cookie-cutter for the genre- someone's got a secret, doesn't want it revealed, and will go to great lengths to ensure that it is not revealed.  This poses a large problem for the protagonists, of course, who are going to great lengths to try to reveal the secret.<br /><br />The real secret to Deception Point though, is that there is no real secret at all.  If you've read any of Brown's other books, you've pretty much already read this one in one of its other (very similar) incarnations.

076790592X|3.0|I got the impression that this book was trying to make me cry.  Well, it didn't happen.  Yes, the story was touching, and of course Morrie is a loveable person, but the writing is really quite dull and serves only to tell the story and nothing more.  I was therefore unsurprised to learn that Albom is a sports reporter by day.   <br /> <br />I approached this book with high expectations of gaining new wisdom and insight into life, but walked away feeling that I didn't hear any \\"sage advice\\" that I hadn't heard before.  I am assuming interacting with Morrie face-to-face would have been quite a heartwarming experience, as I'm sure it was for Albom, but the gravity of that experience didn't quite translate through this book for me.

0312263120|2.0|I made it my mission this summer to read all of Brown's novels, and having accomplished that goal, I can say without reservation that Digital Fortress is at the very back of the pack.  It was certainly suspenseful, as all of his books are, but the topic of this book was lacking the intrigue, depth, and meaning of his other books' subject matter.  Of course, the debate over balancing national security and personal privacy is an important one, but Digital Fortress falls flat as a social commentary.   <br /> <br />This book is best described as an old-fashioned whodunnit thriller/murder mystery that happens to take place in an ultra-modern setting (the NSA complex).  Meanwhile, as kind of a side-story, you've got a college professor on a wild goose chase through the streets of Spain.  The whole thing just doesn't quite work, but the cliffhangers at the end of each chapter still keep you turning the pages right to the lackluster finish.

B00003CXC7|5.0|I saw Psycho for the first time about two years ago and loved it, but I liked this one even better and that's saying something. James Stewart is wonderful in his confining part as an everyday man who just happens to be dating a Perfect 10 of a woman played by Grace Kelly. And as a number reviewers have already stated, her opening close-up shot is breathtaking. This is my first time seeing her in a film even though I have heard of her beauty many times and man is she amazing to look at! I am a guy in my twenties and have seen more than enough beautiful woman who bare it all these days on film, but Grace Kelly is a classic beauty that captivates me everytime she is on screen fully clothed and all. Sorry, I got a little off track thinking about her. I think almost everyone knows the plot and if you don't go rent or buy it today. I just purchased Vertigo and The Birds today, so let me end this review so I can relax while watching the master of his craft work his magic again.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I first heard \\"Popular\\" while listening to the radio and immediately decided that \\"Wicked\\" was a CD I must own.  This is an incredible CD with amazing vocals, great lyrics, and despite popular belief, perfect orchestrations.  \\"Wicked\\" truly encourages the idea of two sides to every story.  I don't think Broadway can get any better than this CD!  Trust me, hte first time you pop this CD into your player, you won't be able to take it out!
0743455967|5.0|- I have no stomach for homicidal clowns, deranged fans, out of control dogs- or any of the many other beasts King puts in his books. I just hear about them and I don't sleep, which is a pity because reading On Writing gives an awe-inspiring exhibit of King's writing talents and skills. In this book certain beasts drive him: his desire to be a published author; to engage his family; his drug abuse. Through each obstacle his persistence, his ability to listen, learn and improve- and his naked self awareness- are enviable. I read this book because I like to write. I loved this book because attitude and desire rival talent and luck for the top spot on the recipe for a successful life. And King's book screams this.
B00005JMAH|1.0|This movie was awful!  I don't really know how these other people liked it.  If I hadn't read the book, I would have had NO idea what was going on with certain scenes in the movie.  Other things were added that had no business being in the movie.  Maybe it was the director's attempt at humor with some of these things, but failed miserably.  Warner Bros. would do well NOT to hire this director for the remainder movies.  With the first two movies, I felt like I was in a magical place, with this one...it was just a bunch of kids with magic tricks.  Save your time and money on this one...read the book.  It's WAY better.
B000002U9Y|5.0|That last guy is a moron. Or he was trying to be funny. Or he is honestly too stupid to realise that he's...stupid. Anyway, just in case anyone's confused, the album has nothing to do with 'sorcerers' or Harry Potter. At all.<br />Saucerful of Secrets is great. The songs on it, unlike most of The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, are actually catchy. Let There Be More Light is almost like mainstream Floyd, and Corporal Clegg is actually pretty good even with the ridiculous sounds coming from the kazoo. (sounds horrible to say, but the kazoo actually enhances the song). The chanting on the title track is amazing, too. A solid album.<br />You dork.
B00005NGAL|4.0|See.... I've seen Cats, it's a great show. I've seen it a dozen or more times I'm sure. I am.... \\"glad\\" I guess that they decided to transer it to a format that people could view from their own home, although I feel that it was much better live. I agree with the former poster in reference to the removal of one of the performances, it is sad. It's also sad noone will be able to full enjoy the show as I have in the past. That is, now that the show advertised as \\"Now and Forever\\" is gone from the stage. <br />*sigh* Ah well. Buy this now, and hold on to a little bit of history.
B00005JNEI|3.0|This is by far Moore's worst film ever.  It is boring, badly paced, and terribly edited.  I felt that Moore made bad decisions in cutting in left and right.<br /><br />Sadly, I also think this is the best film to get if you want the truth about Bush.  Anyone who thinks this movie isn't factual is a moron. This movie is filled with facts.  Just be aware that they are not ALL of the facts.  Here you will find the facts that haven't been shown elsewhere, in addition to A LOT of Moore's personal opinions.<br /><br />It is a good movie.  It said what needed to be said.  But it could have been a lot better of a film.
B000000OQY|5.0|This is probably my favorite album from them. \\"You're Crazy\\", \\"Patience\\", and \\"One in a Million\\" give me chills every time I listen. These songs are so good. I wish they had done an entire album of songs like this..acoustic, very warm, just belting out the vocals. The live stuff shows how tight they were in their prime, too. <br /> <br />The acoustic songs have an organic, atmospheric quality that they never captured again. A truly great rock-n-roll album.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|As a huge Wizard of Oz fan (both the books and the 1939 movie), I was skeptical about seeing this re-telling of Oz, but by the end of the opening number, I was hooked. The muscial is fabulous, the best I've seen in years, and the soundtrack is great. The leading actresses are perfect for their roles. Go see the show if you're in New York, and buy the soundtrack. You'll love it, and you're little dog will too.
B00006CXXU|5.0|WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THIS ALBUM I WASN'T SO SURE I WOULD LIKE IT BUT IT WAS A PLEASENT SURPRISE. THIS ALBUM SHOWS US ALOT ABOUT CHRISTINA HERSELF HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT SHE WON'T SHARE WITH US! BUT FIGHTER IS A GREAT SONG IT SHOWS SHE HAS A LOT OF COURAGE, DIRRTY TELLS US SHE LIKES TO PARTY AND GET NASTY. GET MINE GET YOURS SAYS SHE LIKES TO MAKE LOVE BUT NOT BE IN LOVE, ONE SONG I THOUGHT WAS KIND OF SAD WAS TRACK 19: I'M OK. I HOPE THAT REALLY DIDN'T HAPPEN TO HER. WALK AWAY IS A SWEET MELODY I LIKE UNDERAPRRICATED TO, I CAN IDENTIFY WITH THAT SONG ANYWAY MY POINT IS WAY TO GO CHRISTINA! ALSO I THINK THAT SHE IS GREAT FOR SHOWING US THAT SHE DOESN'T CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK ABOUT HER!
0812550706|1.0|Throughout the book it is dominated by hatred and violence, it is  a mindless world only abusing and killing prevail, all these happen among small children is even more disturbing. It is not suitable for kids, neither for adults.     Card is a human hater, in his world, children are manipulated to hate each other by adults, to train them to be killing machines, to do that they need first kill each other, the only compassion in this book is from the buggers and for buggers, not for human.     The writting style is awful, the story line is as good as an arcade game's(that's why it attracts kids, for worse), the character just keeps going to other levels to fight other monsters, yet they are all the same, only bigger. This repeats over and over, and all the dialogues are like the sound of scraping metal sheets. In the end, if you have children, try your best to protect them from this book, it is poison.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I can not get enough Gavin, and I was only introduced to his music 2 weeks ago.  A friend of mine asked if I wanted to go on a road trip to a concert...I said yes, might be a fun time and if not the tickets were cheap enough so it wouldn't matter.   Well, she let me borrow her Stripped CD one night, and I was blown away.  I went out and bought it the next day! =)  I find myself belting out the lyrics as I am driving through town, I'm sure I've scared a few people by now, but I don't care!  I love this CD!  It's nice when a songwriter actually has a wonderful voice and is the one performing their msuic.  If you can see him concert DO IT!  He rocks on stage...
B0000797IO|4.0|After watching this movie twice, I still wonder if the title is fitting description of Jennifer Aniston's character, Justine, or rather a big joke. I suppose it can go either way, it just depends on the moviegoer. It's a very good movie, very slow paced and humdrum, which is altogether fitting. The characters are comical, but depressing to watch at the same time.  <br /> <br />Justine (Aniston) is bored with her life, working day to day at the Retail Rodeo and putting up with her stoner husband Phil (marvelously played by John C. Reilly). Then one day she strikes up a conversation with new cashier Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal) and perhaps sees a bit of herself in him. Their relationship grows, though it's more like a weed than a rose.  <br /> <br />Jake Gyllenhaal is fanstastic in this movie. His droopy look and depressed demeanor make his performance intensely believeable. Aniston also delivers, prooving that she's more than just Rachel on Friends. Zooey Deschanel also gives a great perfomance as one of Justine's co-workers, who does little to hide her anger that she has to work at the Retail Rodeo. This is a stellar cast!!Awesome script by Mike White, who also appears in the film as a bible-thumping security guard. Definitely give this one a look see, you won't disappointed.
B00006RINF|5.0|This is an amazing album. It is very different to any other albums I know even though some people compare them to Evanescence I don't think you can. Cristina has the most beautiful vocals and shows how you don't have to have a rocky voice to sing rock music. Andrea totally complements Christina's vocals and they harmonise fantasticly! <br /> <br />Swamped 10/10 - This kind of has an indian hint to it it's so different I love it. The music is fantastic a total change! <br /> <br />Heavens a lie 10/10 - One of the most catchy mainstream songs this is very cool and both vocals fit hand in hand this could be Lacuna Coils real breakthough track! <br /> <br />Daylight Dancer 9/10 - I woudn't say it's gothic but this has a great spooky hint in the back ground it's anoyher fantasic track. <br /> <br />Humane 9/10 - Starts completly diffent maybe even slightly dancy but it soon gets back to the beautifull Coil. This is a much slower track and it's extremly beautiful and Haunting! <br /> <br />Self Deception 10/10 - This is an extremly catchy song and is quite different to the others back to the rock again! <br /> <br />Aeon 7/10 - Not bad but not half as good as the other tracks it's only short though so it's more of an interlude. <br /> <br />Tight Rope 10/10 - One of the best songs the music is fantastic the spooky edge is amazing and the guitars are quite heavy. Once again fantastic Vocals. Outstanding! <br /> <br />The ghost woman and hunter 8/10 - A refreshing change to haer a very sweet mellow track. The song has such a deep emotion. <br /> <br />Unspoken 9/10 - Back to the great stuff another wicked track! With amazing music! <br /> <br />Entwined 9/10 - Great harmonising this shows how well the two singers work together they're fantastic! <br /> <br />The Prophet said 10/10 - I love the heavier edge that Andrea's vocals give the band his work on this song is great! <br /> <br />Angel's punishment 7/10 - This is completly different and maximum points for trying something different this song definatly grows on you probably the heaviest vocally on the album. <br /> <br />Comalies 8/10 - Quite a good ending to this fantastic album although not as catchy as most of the other tracks. The Itallian sonds beautifull though <br /> <br />This is such a different and refreshing album and I definatlly recomend it to anyone looking for something a bit different who's sick of all the bands that sound the same!
1400032717|4.0|This marvelous little book is much more of an accomplished literary work and a fascinating read than might be suggested by comparisons to other works with ostensibly similar subject matter. The narrator of the book, Christopher, is incapable of having true emotional understanding, and in a work of literature that's an incredibly daunting technical problem.  (I would caution against reading reviews that might give away too much of the course of the plot; much of the joy and emotional center in this book is in going through the progression of revelation that we see, while Christopher does not.)<br /><br />The clever way in which Mr. Haddon uses this point of view -- a narrator with no understanding of social cues, lying, metaphor, or context, when all those things are the essence of great fiction (most especially detective and mystery fiction) -- makes for great reading. The book's immediate mystery is a Hitchcockian MacGuffin: who killed the dog is not so much the issue as the circumstances that produced the crime. As Christopher goes through the paces of solving the crime in his own way with his own sense of justice, the layers of circumstance in his life that produced the crime are peeled back onion-like. One can almost take the onion metaphor literally: it becomes more obviously poignant and complex, and the tears may follow with the peeling.<br /><br />This is not truly a book about autism: to the degree that it is, it speaks powerfully to the difficulties imposed on the familiies of the autistic. Comparisons to the one-note \\"Rain Man\\" or the artificial and inaccurate \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" do not do \\"The Curious Incident\\" justice. It is neither a tear-jerker for the sake of being a tear-jerker, nor a tragedy beyond that of circumstance.<br /><br />The book's narraation becomes a sort of \\"black box\\": Christopher is bombarded with irregular incidents in a life where he would be better off ordered, and the way those events are deflected when they come out of his prism move the action along. \\"Curious Incident\\" becomes completely engrossing in a way that would be difficult to imagine if one just mentioned there are nearly random digressions into geometrical proofs, logic problems, existential proofs of the lack of a God, and various other puzzle-solving. Each of these diversions becomes a means of surfacing for air, for Christopher and for the reader.<br /><br />This is a relatively short and easy read given the accomplished literary form, and extremely rewarding; well-recommended.ism move the action along. \\"Curious Incident\\" becomes completely engrossing in a way that would be difficult to imagine if one just mentioned there are nearly random digressions into geometrical proofs, logic problems, existential proofs of the lack of a God, and various other puzzle-solving.

B000003TA4|5.0|Theres many debates as to which is the best Nirvana album, it all depends on what you are looking for if you want something pure and raw - Incesticide, slightly heavier - In Utero but in terms of catchy beats Nevermind wins it hands down. Even 13 years after it's release it still remains fresh and as essential as it did back then! This album is a true masterpiece Kurt Cobain is the last real rock hero and no one in the modern world can compete. <br /> <br />Smells like teen spirit - One of the most well known songs in rock history and well deserved even after a thousand listens this song will never become boring and is still as catchy as hell! <br /> <br />In bloom - Kurt has realy got the loud/qiet thing off to a t in this song it is amazing. It is a mellower song but still has a catchey vibe! <br /> <br />Come as you are - What a song! Nirvana songs never date and this would still explode if it was re-released an amazing mellow track. <br /> <br />Breed - In terms of catchiness I give this song 10/10 who can listen to Breed and not shake their booty. Essential for nights alone when you can dance as bad as you like with no one in sight! <br /> <br />Lithium - The loud/qiet is great again and the catchy mellow beat is still their. Wicked song! <br /> <br />Polly - Probably my least favourite track, but full marks for trying something different. The lyrics make it somewhat haunting! <br /> <br />Territorial Pissings - A full blown 10/10 for this song it rocks probably the most rock on the album it's amazing Kurts voice gets wild in the last chorouses of the song! <br /> <br />Drain You - Another amazing song although not outstanding. Having said that theres not a bad song on the album, still cool! <br /> <br />Lounge act - I love the music to this song it's kinda differnt to the average Nirvana song I love the song because it's different! <br /> <br />Stay away - My second least favourite not bad but not my kind of song the verses let it down! <br /> <br />On a plain- Amazing song mainly cos it brings back good memories. But cool song! <br /> <br />Something in the way - About the times Kurt used to sleep under the bridge, it may not be rocks best ballad but it is an amazing song the lyrics are haunting and so emotional. It always reminds me of how lucky I am! <br /> <br />Overall a fantastic album it realy is worth getting if not already got it. It may be 13 years old but good rock never dates. this is music that will suit evey kind of listener whether it's the mainstream or a real rock fan!
B000059HB7|5.0|rio bravo is one of the great films of our time. John Wayne as the no nonsense sheriff, Dean Martin as his alcoholic ex deputy, and Walter Brennan as his gimpy frontier deputy. Anyone who has seen this movie will tell you that Martin and Brennan steal the show. Unfortunately vetran character actor Ward Bond has a brief appearance in this movie. However it sets up the interjection of Ricky Nelson. Wayne knew box office and was willing to put singers in his westerns, such as F.Avalon in the Alamo, and Bobby Vinton in The Train Robbers, and Big Jake. Some have said Angie Dickinson was not needed in this movie. It probably could've been handled by an older actress, say Maureen O'Hara. However Angie does all right. The script has moments of romance comedy drama and action, but the central core of this movie is the interaction between Wayne, Brennan, and Martin. Even the villans are high quality actors, John Russell and Claude Akins. John Wayne in this movie shows he doesn't have to dominate the film

0375507256|5.0|There are several levels at which one can appreciate David Mitchell's fantastic novel, Cloud Atlas, and like the novel's narrative, they unfold out of each other.  The first level is the novel's construction.  Cloud Atlas is made up of six narratives.  Each narrative begins, is interrupted by the next, and then they resume in opposite order.  Like a child opening a matrioshka doll, the reader delves deeper and deeper into Mitchell's world, and is sent careening back out.  This device might sound difficult or confusing, but it is fascinating, especially as echoes of earlier narratives appear in the later ones.  The book becomes a treasure hunt - an active exploration. <br /> <br />The second level is Mitchell's artistry.  Each narrative is told in a different style - diary entries, letters, a mystery, a farce, an interview, and a tale told around a fire.  Mitchell's ability to mimic each voice is so perfect that it is difficult to credit that he is the ventriloquist behind these six souls.  He captures perfectly the vivid and memorable protagonists (and, in all but one case, narrators) of his six stories.  At turns witty, hilarious and heartbreaking, they remain indelible in the reader's mind, thanks to Mitchell's facility with language. <br /> <br />Up until this point it might be possible to dismiss Cloud Atlas as clever and fun, but Mitchell truly has something to say along with a clever way of saying it.  Mitchell touches on so many themes and ideas in this relatively short book.  Cloud Atlas is a kaleidescopic view of kindness and cruely, civilization and barbarism, enslavement and release.  Through it all, the power of art, of history and of faith endures.   <br /> <br />Cloud Atlas combines three qualities that any devoted reader should be looking for - clever and challenging narrative, excellent writing, and heart.  I highly recommend it to any reader looking for an unusual, thought-provoking book.

B0000AGQ6Z|5.0|After the success of his 1957 hit 'Bridge On The River Kwai', David Lean returned with his 1962 direction of 'Lawrence of Arabia.'  A visual feast in every respect, the film brings out all of the drama and tension that pervaded T.E. Lawrence's    spectacular yet turbulent life.    The film starts at the end of WWI in England with Lawrence's(Peter O'Toole) death in a freak motorcycle accident. After his funeral, various acquaintances give conflicting opinions as to what they thought of the man and his achievements; the film then goes back to Lawrence's obscure origins as a low-ranked officer in Cairo during World War I.  Relieved of his boredom as a map maker/surveyor for military intelligence, Lawrence is sent across the Suez Canal to Arabia to establish contact with Bedouin tribes who might serve as guerillas against the Ottoman Turks.  At first unfamiliar with Arab culture and encountering a somewhat hostile reception, Lawrwence earns the trust of King Faisel (Alec Guiness) and his protege (Omar Shariff).  After a series of successful guerilla operations with the help of another sheik (Antony Quinn) and his followers against the Turks, Lawrence becomes a legendary icon for the Arabs as he seeks to unite their disparate tribes into a single nation.     This is truly another example of Hollywood at its very best.  The sweeping cinematography of the desert, in addition to being a visual feast, provides a strong thematic backdrop for the Arab culture at that time.  In 1914-1918, Arabs (meaning specifically peoples from the Arabian peninsula) were mostly semi-nomadic peoples grouped in clans or tribes with vast territories centered around vital water wells that were more valuable than life itself.  The film accurately shows that only Westerners thought of Arabs as 'Arabs.'  Paraphrasing the character of Antony Quinn's response when Lawrence proposes that all 'Arabs' should be united: 'I know of Hawitat and Hashemites, but Arabs?  I know no such tribe.' The film of course is primarily focused on Lawrence's character; the forces which made him a hero; the bonds he formed; and, how those events changed his life to make him a legend in his own time.  All of this is done by first class acting and the impeccable direction of David Lean.    In conclusion, this is one of the greatest films ever made in which its images speak for themselves.  This is all enhanced by the performance of first-rate actors under the guidance of a talented director.  All of this accompanied by the legendary score of Maurice Jarre (Dr. Zhivago, Frantic, and countless other great films.)  Get only the superbit version as the others don't do justice to the cinematography.  This is a film for everyone's collection.

Never had I heard of a music style that was so energetic, so original, and so utterly irresistable. Dropping everything I was doing at the time, I ended up watching the whole show, and bought his LATA CD the next day. If there is such a thing as music revelation, this was it. I have listened to this CD for 10 years and never got tired of it. I have bought many of his other CDs and went to 2 of his concerts (Tribute and Ethnicity) but none come close to this album... the reason why I gave it a 5!

B0001UL7RY|5.0|No, it's not a revolution in modern rock... Under My Skin, though, is  an excellent commercial rock album, full of youthful energy. The music is not that different from what many other popular artists are producing nowadays, but is certainly far to the right of the bell curve. As for the lyrics, even though they sound odd at times (and make me really believe that a teen-ager actually wrote them), they convey a toughness that I would like to see a bit more widespread among girls today. I'd much rather hear how Avril kicked an idiot would-be boyfriend than groan while listening to another of the innumerable &quot;I luuuuuuuv you&quot; songs so common in pop music.<br />The album also gets better with time, which is always good.
B00003CXD5|5.0|This 1948 masterpiece written and directed by the legendary John Huston is truly one of the greatest films ever made.  The film's unique screenplay and great cinematography, along with  brilliant direction and superb cast have made this film a treasure worth more than gold to audiences worldwide for over 50 years. <br /> <br />Fred C. Dobbs (Bogart)is an American hoboe who's all washed up begging for meals in a small Mexican town.  After listening to the wild tales of an old miner (Walter Huston) in a flea hotel, Dobbs and another young out-of-luck adventurer (Tim Holt) decide to put all their money in mules, gold pans, and guns to join him on a prospecting expedition in the Sierra Madre.  As the characters begin finding gold, they start finding out what they're really worth. <br /> <br />The film's screenplay is unusual in that it primarily focuses on the character of Dobbs who's more of an antagonist in the story.  The film has multiple themes and plots dealing with human nature and what men will do to strike it rich.  The main theme of course is greed: how the presence of riches never seems to satiate once it's within one's grasp.  Other thematic elements that flow from that central theme are similar to Dostoevsky's 'Crime and Punishment' in dealing with the thought process of a man who thinks he's superior to the moral confines of his conscience; how, being morally superior and smarter, one feels that they're entitled to be a supreme judge over others.  Huston's brilliant direction brings these character studies and themes to the forefront with great camera work.  Bringing to life the character of Dobbs is a challenging task for an actor but Bogart does it brilliantly.  The acting of Huston and Holt is also top knotch and makes the film a completely believable and moving adventure. <br /> <br />This is a true cinematic masterpiece that everyone can enjoy.  Its rich themes and piercing character studies educate as well as entertain the audience on the many facetsof human nature.  I strongly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates a great adventure story with moral insight.
B00005JMEW|1.0|When hollywood doesn't know how to capture an audience with anything intelligent or unique, they can always resort to the cheapest and easiest trick in the book.  Just shock the audience.  Show them something more repulsive or twisted than they've seen before.  It's easy to do, and it always buys a few good reviews from people who think anything that shocks them must be art. <br />The fight scenes in this movie are less imaginative than what you can see at home in Alias or Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but they add ridiculous amounts of blood to please the small minded serial killer wannabes out there.  No realism - just characters that never go into shock or bleed to death.  This movie carries on Hollywood's seeming goal of desensitizing the public to any kind of atrocity - perhaps to help make the real atrocities in the world more pallatable for us.  Don't see this film.  I did, and it's a memory I wish I could erase.
B00003CX97|5.0|David Lean (Lawrence of Arabia) directs this 1957 adapatation of Pierre Boulle's (author of 'Planet of the Apes') great World War II novel.  The film still stands as one of the greatest war films ever made with superb direction and an all-star cast that provide deep character studies with all the action and tension one expects from a war story.    Confined to an inhospitable Japanese prison camp burried in the jungles of Southeast Asia, a British POW, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), is subjected to the cruel torture of the camp commander Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) for choosing to stand for principle as to the treatment of his officers.  Saito needs competent engineers and laborers to build a railroad tressle bridge on a tight schedule and, although at first infuriated by Nicholson's stiff upper lip and low opinion of Japanese culture, he begins to exploit Nicholson's ego to compel him to build the bridge properly and on time.  Thinking that he will show the 'inferior' Japanese how much better the English are in engineering, Nicholson becomes obsessed with building the enemy bridge and oblivious to the treasonous implications of such an act.  In the mean time, a cowardly American POW (William Holden) escapes to safety only to be later coerced by the English to return and sabotage the bridge in a commando raid.  Leading the British demolition expert (Jack Hawkins), Holden's character returns to the bridge for the final showdown.    This is a brilliant war film with a plot that's primarily character driven as opposed to action driven: the tension comes from the clash of wills between all of the characters as opposed to a non-stop action clash of arms.  The film also seems to deal with the uncertain consequences of bravery and cowardice in the sense that, although Nicholson at first bravely stands for his principles, he blindly becomes a suppliant to Colonel Saito's plans to finish the bridge.  On the other hand, although Holden's character is the epidemy of cowardice and self-interest, it is he who becomes one of the true heroes of the story.  The film in essence follows the story by Pierre Boulle but, as is almost always the case, the book is better.  In the book, there is no flinching to Nicholson's unrelenting snobbishness and utter stupidity and he does not 'wake up' at the last minute to fall on the detonator: the mission fails. Also, William Holden's character does not exist. There is no American ex-POW guiding the commandos back to the bridge.    This film is very well directed and has great camera work.  Filmed in Sri Lanka, the great cinematography captures every ray of heat and drop of humidity one finds in the dense jungle. The acting is top knotch all the way around. Finally, who can forget the timeless whistling tune sung by the POWs.  This is another great drama that should be in every war film lover's collection.
B000002HPV|4.0|\\"Homogenic\\" is definitely a more focused Bjork album than past efforts. the entire collection maintains it's dark and daring theme infused with plenty of weepy strings and glitchy sweet electronics fusing themselves together. there are some very strange distorted beats on some of these songs that almost overshadow some of the quiet beauty of these songs...but in the end, the quiet beauty wins out. this is by far the most personal of all Bjork's albums and the most dramatic. there are some unextraordinary songs on here (\\"5 Years,\\" \\"Pluto\\") and some instantly classic songs (\\"Hunter,\\" \\"Joga,\\" and the sweeping \\"Bachelorette\\"). but the most beautiful song to me is \\"Unravel.\\" i could listen to this song all day long. it's melody is unusual but very soothing and very sweet. the background music is soft and snuggly and downright gorgeous. it makes my mind think of the way sunshine looks shining through ice. it sounds like alot of the music on the Pop Ambient compilations or groups that are coming out on the german record label Morr Music these days. very sublime. very gentle and sweet.<br /><br />there's an obvious magick and delicate beauty of Bjork's music. she has the power to harness all her outrageous ideas and mold (or allow her producers to mold) those elements and create an amazing sonic masterpiece that stands the test of time. all her albums come highly recommended and i have a hard time trying to tell people who don't own any of her solo albums which one is best to start with, but \\"Homogenic\\" stands in my mind as a landmark album, signaling a new maturity for Bjork and a great place for the newcomer to begin exploration of this fabulous and timeless artist.<br /><br />now...bring on the ungoldy amount of remixes!
B00005JMAH|2.0|I had average hopes for this movie - I was caught in the middle because I had thought that the second movie was too much like the first, but then again, I didn't want it to be too different because I realized that it should have the same feel throughout the series.  Using a relatively untested director worried me, and my concerns were realized.  Like many other reviewers, I thought that the movie was too rushed - in the first two I at least got the feeling that a year had passed during the film, while here it seemed that it all happened in a matter of days.  I too agree with those who were displeased with the apparent editing of the story.  I realize that this is necessary in order to turn a book into a movie (just consider what Peter Jackson did to the LOTR books), and I also realize that the control of that is out of our (the general viewing public's) hands.  However, what possible need existed that called for them to change the location of Hagrid's Hut and the resizing and locating of the Whomping Willow??!!  Somebody ought to have reigned these changes in.  I thought that since Chris Columbus was producing the movie, he might see to that.  Apparently not.  Still, disappointed as I was, I plan to add it to my collection - but then, of course, it would be silly to leave one of seven out, so that's not really a recommendation, is it?
B000002TQB|4.0|the first song, the unescapeably catchy \\"Girls & Boys\\" lunges out of the starting gate with an inspired fusing of the Kinks and electrolash. it's a dazzling display of dancing rythms and snappy singing. things continue to go well into \\"Tracy Jacks\\" and on into the great \\"End of a Century.\\" by the time \\"Parklife\\" was released, Blur was a well oiled machine. having escaped the potential of being a one-hit wonder with their first single off their first album. they expanded upon their intelligent and fabulously catchy british-styled songwriting for their second album (the great \\"Modern Life is Rubbish\\"), but here on \\"Parklife\\" the band sounds more confident in their swagger and their stance. banging out ridiculously wonderful songs like \\"London Loves,\\" \\"Clover Over Dover\\" and maintaining a good sense of the human condition on songs like \\"To the End\\" and \\"This Is A Low.\\" a wonderfully well rounded album that only catapulted their star higher and higher. as with all their albums, the layout of \\"Parklife\\" is both visually stunning as well as clever and kinda funny. no question about it, this album is a winner on all levels.

B000002HH2|3.0|say goodbye to the deliciously demented Sugarcubes, and say hello to Bjork solo pop star! in her old bands it was obvious that there was a mighty strong force brewing in her mind and with her vocals. sometimes her ideas seemed suffocated by her fellow band member's contributions; so thank god that someone had the sense to let her go solo and really explore the outer and inner dephths of her talent. now that she has enjoyed a healthy and high profile solo career for quite some time; it's amazing to take a look back at her past catalogue and examine her progression over the years.<br /><br />and here's the second album...the sophmore slump(?). no, not exactly...but this album took alot longer to grow on me. it seems like there is some kind of transition going on here within these songs, and there are some great great songs on this cd, but as a whole, it can get kind of lost. the album starts off with the very dark and very un-tuneful \\"Army of Me.\\" i'm still surprised that this song has become so popular; not because it's not a great song, because it is...but it's just so \\"out there\\" for a pop song. it sounds more like a military marching pop song (hence the title) than something you'd want to listen to in your car with the windows down. then on to the achingly beautiful \\"Hyper-ballad\\" and \\"The Modern Things\\" which both soar up and down with the orchestrated chorus and gentle electronic treatment. the song everyone knows from this album is \\"It's Oh So Quiet\\" with it's jazzy sound and cutesy lyrics about falling in love. it's a good song but it sticks out like a sore thumb on this album. it sounds like a leftover from Bjork's \\"Gling-Glo\\" album. don't get me wrong, it's a good song...but very out of place on \\"Post.\\" the remainder of the album sort of settles in a snoozy and dreamy song mix with \\"Isobel\\" and \\"I Miss You\\" being nice standouts. there's a  nice homey snuggly feel to alot of the second half of this album that seems to be more organicly coherent than the first half.<br /><br />\\"Post\\" did grow on me the more i listed to it...but of all her solo cd's, this one remains as a somewhat difficult album to fully wrap my arms around. i adore Bjork's artistic vision and i have a hard time trying to tell people who don't own any of her solo albums which one is best to start with, but in my opinion, \\"Post\\" is probably not the best place for a new Bjork fan to begin exploring.<br /><br />now...bring on the ungoldy amount of remixes!st half. <br /> <br />\\"Post\\" did grow on me the more i listed to it...but of all her solo cd's, this one remains as a somewhat difficult album to fully wrap my arms around. i adore Bjork's artistic vision and i have a hard time trying to tell people who don't own any of her solo albums which one is best to start with, but in my opinion, \\"Post\\" is probably not the best place for a new Bjork fan to begin exploring. <br /> <br />now...bring on the ungoldy amount of remixes!
0375507256|4.0|Whether you preferred number9dream or Ghostwritten, Cloud Atlas is the best of both worlds as Mitchell's most ambitious and polished work to date. Instead of the loosely related, chronolocigally concurrent stories of Ghostwritten, Cloud Atlas uses stories that are temporally dispersed, instead of just geographically so, and for the most part Mitchell manages to avoid the biggest fault of Ghostwritten, the stories all have a powerful and recognizable impact on their flanking stories without seeming so contrived it takes away from the story. The story of an American Notary crossing the Pacific in the 1860's has an impact on the story (not just plot-wise, but thematically was well) of a Belgian composer in the 1930's which effects the story of the 1975 story of a Californian investigative journalist who recurs in the next story of an elderly editor in conteporary London who has an influence on the story of a Korean genetically engineered slave in the near future who in turn figues prominently in the central, post-apocalyptic world of young Hawaiian tribesman. (How's that for a run-on?) However, let me sneak in a word on the novel's structure: unline Ghostwritten, in which each story was told in its entirety at once, each story in Cloud Atlas is divided right down the middle into two halves. The first half of each story is told in ascending chronological order. Then, when we get to the post-apocalyptic story, it is told in its entirety before the other five stories finish themselves up in reverse chronological order. Hence, we start in the 1860's, and we end in the 1860's. Each story is nested inside the chronologically earlier ones, and each contain the chronologically later ones inside. This structure is in no way a mere gimmick. Mitchell uses it to produce quite an effect. <br /> <br />During the chronologically progressive first half of the stories, Michell begins to unfold for the reader that what is happening in each story is contributing, seemingly inexoriably, to the bleak future of mankind. Mitchell seems to say that, given the prevalent greed in human nature, that's where we're going to end up, no matter what. Hence, he sets up the theme that figures so prominently in the end of Ghostwritten: the role of human agency in the face of the seemingly contradictory facts of human nature. However, nothing in any of Mitchell's novels is quite that simple. As the stories begin to unwind, we begin to see the role choice has played in all this, and we see the hope for mankind's future that each story's second half produces after the seeming condemnation of the first half of the book. We get to see the impact each character's life has on the lives of the other characters. It's something of a surreal experience to read. <br /> <br />Now, I also said that Cloud Atlas Also includes the best parts of number9dream. While the overall structure and driving force of the novel is descended from Ghostwritten, the novel's lighter, more playful side descends from number9dream. Like Mitchell's second novel, Cloud Atlas is very playful as far as what is real and what isn't. Again, it's up to the reader to decide what to believe and how exactly each episode relates to those other episodes surrounding it, and then what kind of impact that level of reality in that story has on the novel as a whole. It also incorporates the exciting aura of Mitchells narration and language found in number9dream along with philosophical moments that are out of place in the real world, but fit right into the context of Mitchell's novel as such passages often do into the works of Don Delillo. We also get the depth of character in at least four out of these six stories that we get with Eji in number9dream that Ghostwritten didn't have time for. These characters have history, emotion, vulnerability, and the ability to adapt and change. <br /> <br />Is this the greatest novel ever? No. As you can see, I give it four stars. It's amazing, and I wouldn't be saddened to see itget nominated for (or win) the next Booker, but Mitchell has not yet written his masterpiece. Often, he still comes across as heavy-handed, especially in his criticism of colonialism (massive running theme) and human nature. (For him, they are rather blurred together--something he tends to do much more often than many other British Post-Colonialist writers.) Also, occasionally he telegraphs a plot twist, gives us a not-quite-satisfying climax, or wraps up a story a little too quickly. These faults are most evident in the sixth story, but they occasionally become evident in almost every story to some extent with the notable exception of the story of the Belgian composer (this is the story that really ties the whole novel together, and is probably the single best thing Mitchell has ever written). <br /> <br />But overall, I highly recommend this book to previous Mitchell fans-it's definately his most well-rounded book-and I would also recommend this to fans of authors such as Jeanette Winterson, Don Delillo, Salman Rushdie, and others of their ilk. If you didn't much care for either of Mitchell's books, I don't really think this one will change your opinion.
6305291446|4.0|I am a die-hard Halloween fan, but not a die-hard fan of the franchise.  As far as I'm concerned Halloween does not need any sequels and I can do just fine without them, but Halloween II unravels the mystery posed in Halloween (though John Caprenter never originally intended any sequels or plot twists), and Halloween H20 throws in a nice alternative ending to the one we were offered in Halloween II with the supposed demise of Dr. Sam Loomis and Michael Audrey Myers (the Shape).      But H20 has some annoying flaws:  1.  The sound track is awful; it completely lacks \\"atmosphere\\" and is a mix of Psycho, Halloween and Scream, and an odd assortment of orchestral noises and Rock/Hip-Hop that do not mesh well together.  Halloween 1-4 all had excellent soundtracks though Halloween III was more \\"synthetic\\" than any of them.    2.  Unlike Halloween and Halloween II Michael Myers needlessly murders a few people, most of them in the opening sequence.  If you recall the first two films, he killed out of necessity; to eliminate obstacles or to create lures (except in the case of the one girl he killed at the beginning of Halloween II.  He must have been just a little irritated for having been shot by Dr. Loomis).  But as with every Myers sequel since then he just sort of kills for the sake of killing.  3.  The opening scenes had all of the look and feel of the original Halloween, especially with the opening theme of Mr. Sandman.  It was saturated with \\"atmosphere.\\"  Unfortunatley it faded quickly and never returned as the story shifts from Illinois to California.  Halloween and all the other sequels made much better use of shadows and lighting than this one, probably because of light filters or the lack of.  Halloween had a lot of blue effect and made use of a dimmer switch in the scene where Michael seems to materialize out of the darkness behind Laurie.  The same dimmer switch lighting technique was used in Halloween II when Michael faded in out of nowhere and grabbed Janet.H20 did not make the best possible use of \\"atmosphere\\" though it was an admirable attempt.  4.  There were a few annoying plot holes.  Where has Michael been all these years?  How did he drive from Illinois to California in a day and a half--with a stolen car--without drawing the attention of every law enforcement agency in the region?  A photo and newspaper clipping about Laurie's daughter, Jamie, is on Dr. Loomis' wall at the beginning of the movie but no mention is made of her in the story.  What happened to that family history?  It does not line up with the previous three sequels although it does not entirely ignore them either.  5.  There is too much graphic violence of a silly nature (like an ice skate through the head and the girl who is strung up from the ceiling with a light bulb in her carcass).    6.  Michael Myers was not quite so menacing as in the first two movies.  Part of the problem is that the mask lacks character.  The features are much more \\"pale\\" and muted, more like Star Trek's Commander Data than William Shatner.  The wild hair didn't help either.  Also we see Michael's eyes all the time; a minor but important detail.  His eyes were rarely seen in Halloween and Halloween II, thus adding immensely to the concept of personified evil.  Michael's breathing cannot be heard and he does not make the obscure grunting noises he made in Halloween when he was struggling to kill someone.  Halloween II lacked this small but important detail as well.  Although I did not expect a repeat of the first two films, I do think a lot of the details that helped make the first film a huge success and the second one stand up fairly well are consistently overlooked in the other installments of this series.    Here are some of the high points of H20:  1.  We revisit an old character, Nurse Marion, who was in Halloween (the rainy station wagon ride with Dr. Sam Loomis) and also in Halloween II (the ride in the Federal Marshall's car).  2.  The writers put a lot more effort into making a serious horror film.  The filmography is outstanding and the acting is top notch; true cinema, not a cheap cheesy horror rip-off.  3.  Jamie Lee Curtis is the central character once again, and this time she faces Michael head-on and on purpose.    H20 is certainly worth owning and a worthy addition to the Halloween series.  It is the closest return attempt to the original plot and seriousness since Halloween II.  It just lacks the element of creepiness that the old team of Carpenter, Hill, and Cundey were able to create, primarily because the original team had real eyes and ears for effective detail.  The latter teams have just written and filmed stories with very little regard to what puts the creepy in Halloween.     The H20 disk is certainly a fine quality product.  The imagery is sharp, the sound is crystal clear, and the interview with Jamie Lee Curtis, Moustapha Akkaad, and John Carpenter is entertaining enough though not really anything new informationally.  Take H20 or leave it...it really does not matter though it is a fine film.    My actual rating of H20 would be 3 1/2 stars.  Halloween II was much better and offered a completely acceptable end to the series.

Alice Sebold.<br /><br />I have read both Lucky and The Lovely Bones...and literally could not put them down.<br /><br />Alice has a wonderful gift as a storyteller.  With her own experience, she was half way there to being \\"The Lovely Bones\\".<br /><br />Thank you Alice for sharing your difficult memoir. You have done society a service, by telling us how it is when your world is turned upside down by circumstances beyond our control. I would like to have a friend as brave as Alice.  Three cheers for this book and I can't wait for the next one from this Talented, engaging writer.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I just returned from this movie about 20 minutes ago, and I am still in awe over the misuse and abuse of power the US government (Bush n' Co.) has \\"enforced.\\" <br /> <br />Some of the images of the innocent Iraqi citizens and everyday people (like you and I) standing in front of demolished homes burying their own children make my skin crawl. Soon-to-be-ex President Bush's ties with the Taliban PRIOR TO Sept. 11 were exposed as a Taliban leader was given a tour of major US government buildings. <br /> <br />Another sickening feature of the Bush administration uncovered in this film is the deception of the American people with this \\"rainbow\\" of security threats. Fahrenheit 9/11 analyzes the truth behind the red, orange, etc. levels of terrorist alert in order to divert attention from the struggles the US was experiencing in Afghanistan. This magician's show of tricking the audience to look one way while doing something sneaky MUST be stopped! <br /> <br />This film is a very powerful, moving film that made me question my own beliefs, principles and ideas I had prior to seeing this documentary. Indeed, at times during the movie I was embarrassed to be an American, but perhaps there is light at the end of the tunnel in November, so all hope is not lost. I urge ANYONE pro or anti-Bush to see this movie and analyze the other side of the media coin.

B000002JQ6|5.0|Back in 1990, AC/DC put out an album called \\"The Razor's Edge.\\" This album had such fist pumping tunes as \\"Thunderstruck\\" and \\"Money Talks,\\" and like most bands, AC/DC hit the road after its release in order to support it. Little did they know that this tour would give birth to a tremendous live album. <br /> <br />The album takes a look at the greatness of experiencing AC/DC live. The roar of the audience and the nonstop genius guitar work of Angus Young keep heads banging for over an hour. From the sounds of a thunderstorm in the beginning of the album to the roar of the cannon blasts at the end, this album boils the adrenaline to steam. <br /> <br />Although the expanded live album includes more tracks that the standard CD, this album of 12 unbelievable rock tunes includes all the classics. The audio quality of recording is amazing and you will hard pressed to find another live album that has the testicular fortitude of AC/DC Live.
0316666343|5.0|My wife and I lost our 12 year old daughter to a sudden and violent death.  About a year later, a friend recommended this book.  I found it a sensitive, accurate and totally plausible rendition of the grieving process for individuals, families and communities. The choices that have to be made are all present in this book, and the consequences of making them one way or another for everyone involved are laid out clearly and non-judgmentally.  The elements of paranormal in the book are not dissimilar to what many people experience in such a loss. <br /> <br />The book itself is written in a compelling and crisp manner. I highly recommend it.
B000000OQF|5.0|When I was growing up, there was a lot of garbage on the radio. Third-rate hair bands had all but ruined a good genre of rock; that is until August of 1987. <br /> <br />Who could have possibly guessed that Guns N' Roses' \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" would have generated as many sales and attention as it did? From the opening track of \\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" the listener is taken into a roller coaster journey of a band singing as villians, victims, and poets.  <br /> <br />Appetite for Destruction is the cliched rock album in which every track is dubbed \\"a classic.\\" Few can disagree. The band put together 12 tracks that offered something for everyone. The three main songs, \\"Jungle,\\" \\"Paradise City,\\" and \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" each characterise different emotions. Whether it is rage and domination, hope and opitimism, or love and affection, these songs dominated the charts in the late 80s. <br /> <br />As the case with many rock bands, no matter how hard they tried on subsequent albums, G N'R were never able to capture that raw emotion and raw power they performed on \\"Appetite.\\" Mere words do not do this album justice, as it must be listened to in order to be appreciated. Only then will you understand why this album always ranks high on lists of all-time top rock albums.
6304698682|4.0|I agree with one of the previous reviewers (Robert Morris) in his comparative analysis of Pale Rider and Shane.  I would only add that the colors and atmosphere of Shane are much warmer, and the feeling in the film is one of new life and fresh starts, with the homesteading family and the young boy, a child, far from grown, all striving against the cattle ranchers in Wyoming.  By contrast in Pale Rider, it seems clear Eastwood wanted to show a family struggling at the end of their rope, at their last gasp, far from any new beginning.  The child in Pale Rider is a teen girl, about to become a woman and take on the hard life of women in a mining town.  Her mother looks worn out but is probably supposed to be not yet thirty.  The colors in Pale Ride are pale and bleak, the atmosphere snowy and cold and gray, the earth ravaged by the mining operation.  The feeling of Pale Rider is bleak and scary, even though Eastwood saves the day in the end.  Shane is much more upbeat, even though there is the sadness of the hero riding off alone in the end.
B0002DB52M|5.0|There is a very good reason Lars Von Trier names his fictional American town Dogville. It behaves very much like a dog. Its very suspicious of outsiders but with a simple tummy rub everyone can be won over and accepted. The film is book ended with the bark of a dog. The dog you see, doesn't exist, he is merely a chalk outline on the floor of a sound stage. Using a minimal amount of props Von Trier creates a town  where everyone is very secretive, yet ironically enough their homes are out in the open for all to see inside.  <br /> <br />Von Trier asks alot from his audience, its up to you to fill in the gaps. Actors close and open doors that simply are not there, but it is your mind that makes it real. In the span of three hour this strange little town will both pass judgement and be judged themselves. Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a woman on the run from gangsters. She ends up in Dogville where she meets a small town of simple town people. The movie chooses to linger and lets you soak in the rich dialogue and accurate performances. Unlike Von Triers previous effort (Dancer in the Dark) this time he lets events happen naturally. Instead of feeling the forced hand of the script making lives miserable, it is characters who act out of instinct that is the driving force through out the movie. They turn from kind to mean very gradually and all the clues are scattered through out nine chapters.  <br /> <br />This Dog has quite a bite and Grace learns this the hard way. The many rich layers of thought have lingered in my mind and I eagerly wish to watch the movie again and catch all the subtle ideas I may have missed the first time around. If there is any criticism in this movie about America, I don't think I would disagree with any of it. I think America is best symbolized by the blind man, who refuses to admit he's blind, and foolishly thinks that no one else has noticed his loss of sight. To criticize the world, is not to disown it, but if we do not admit our loss of sight,than we truly have grown old, stubborn and cold. <br /> <br />Dogville is one of the best films of the year and the first Lars Von Trier film that I truly think works from beginning to end. This is the first in a trilogy, and I cannot wait to see what awaits Grace in the next two films.  I do not give five stars to just any movie but this film has truly deserved it.
0792163710|5.0|I can only echo all the praise from professional critics and plain folks alike for this movie.  I would only add that it is beautiful to look at, especially on DVD, and the music is beautiful also, very memorable tunes.   <br /> <br />The Wyoming countryside and mountains are spectacular and the film really captures a long-gone era in America when land was out there for the taking, after, that is, having been taken from the Indians.  A person could stake a claim, stick to it and that was that! <br /> <br />I also loved the way the director takes his time in many scenes, for example when the villains are waiting in the bar for the final showdown, and when Shane is slowly riding toward them.  Nice, easy pacing, not overwrought.  The commentary track had some interesting revelations about Jean Arthur, the way the mountains were filmed, and the way the animals were trained for the film.  All neat stuff attached to a masterful piece of entertainment that has heart and depth.
B00008EY65|3.0|Big grouchy-face Ron Perlman as a reluctant superhero summoned from the outer reaches of hell by the Nazis? I mean, how could you not like \\"Hellboy\\"? True, the sucker is flat as a wafer and could've done with a Gary Busey cameo, but still... Del Toro manages a similar trick here to the one he pulled on \\"Blade 2\\", conjuring up a comic book spectacular that's simultaneously deeply crappy and oddly loveable. No fab FX - in fact, nothing particularly memorable at all - but, Lordy, give Big Ron a few choice quips and a big red rubber mask the size of Odin and you've got a winner. Tip: they do here.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|What can you say about R.I.P. this album is a masterpiece, one of the best heavy metal releases ever! This ain't Korn, Manson or any of that other crap thats &quot;In&quot; now a days. This is Megadeth! There's not much more that I can say that wasn't said in the review already. I just doubled my Megadeth cd collection by getting all the remasters and I don't regret it one bit! It sounds so much better remastered, it's like buying a new cd.
B00008J4P5|4.0|oh, man. these guys are great. i just love 7 nation army. such a catchy song. their whole album is great and i recommend you go buy it right now if you like bleusy rock music. its hard to believe that its a two person band.... can you even call that a band? but it doesnt matter, cuz they play better than a lot of other bands out there. the only reason why i give it 4 stars is because Meg's drumming isnt as good as it should be on some songs. also, i think they should have someone else that could play bass guitar along with Jack. GO BUY THIS CD NOW, OR ELSE STOP READING THIS REVIEW! I SAID STOP READING! YOU'RE STILL READING! GO BUY IT!
B000003TA4|5.0|There's not much to say about this album that hasn't already been force fed to the general public for the last 13 years, but here's my commentary, so to speak. I've seen it in many \\"Best Albums\\" lists, be it by a famous publication like Rolling Stone, or some seemingly insignificant user of the internet's home page. The thing is, this album is inescapable in terms of it's public exposure.  <br /> <br />I was a little late in my discovery of this album, being only 6 when it was released. And I admittedly thought nothing of it until my teens. Which is why I write this review; people only just discovering this album have a hard time, as they have been exposed to an innumerable amount of bands which copy Nirvana's style. It's hard to forget everthing you've heard and think of this as the be all and end all of modern records. But for me, it's the quality of everything here that makes it so special. Sure, there have been countless amounts of bands trying to copy the sound of this album, but none of them have come close to re-capturing it's finnesse in terms of an overall package. <br /> <br />It's one of those rare albums that you can listen to all the way through and still have a hunger for more. It still sounds good after 13 years (as my father constantly reminds me), and it is still obvious why it is held so highly in everyone's regard.  <br /> <br />I love this album, and if I met someone who didn't, I'd strongly question thier taste in music.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I love this movie. But ofcourse it didn't have everything that the book had, but it was close enough. I love Daniel Radcliffe in this movie (ofcourse I love him in every movie that he's in). I think it had some surprising parts, and a couple of scary parts. It's just amazing to see the HP cast grow up so quickly. This movie is definitely a keeper (what I call a movie that's good enough to buy).
B0002IU988|5.0|Just a bit of background - I didn't catch onto Creed until the spring of 2000 when songs like Higher and With Arms Wide Open hit the airwaves.  Just so you don't think I simply follow whatever is popular at that moment, I can honestly say I will listen to ANY kind of music out there, by which I mean hard rock, rap, pop, jazz, classical, country, anything, you  name it.  I just happen to love guitar and appreciate good guitar playing when I hear it especially. <br /> <br />After being front row at a Creed show in the summer of 2000, I became a fanatic.  The only thing that bothered me was how cautious the guitar playing was in Creed (cautious yet completely and perfectly effective).  I always felt that Tremonti was holding back so much, I just knew he had more talent than was being used in Creed.  Listen to Pity for a Dime off of My Own Prison and Stand Here With Me off of Weathered.  Those were actually my two favorite Creed songs - because of the guitar solos.  All I ever wanted to hear though was what Tremonti really could do. <br /> <br />Like some others I was bummed when Creed \\"broke up,\\" then I realized that in fact, whether they said it or not, what really happened was that they simply reunited with bassist Marshall and replaced Stapp with another singer.  At that point I wasn't really concerned with who the singer was, I was just curious what the new band would turn out.  Or should I say, what Tremonti would do... <br /> <br />Wow.  That's all I can say.  Wow.  If you like guitar, this belongs in your collection.  Myles Kennedy is, in my opinion, an adequate singer, I think they could have done better.  But hell, I could be the lead singer in this group and my horrible voice still wouldn't overshadow the tremendous guitar chops that Tremonti finally displays in this album.  And I'd heard in an interview on the Alter Bridge site that Tremonti might even actually be *still* holding some tricks up his sleeve for an upcoming Alter Bridge album.  Buy this.  If you like guitar, a la Zakk Wylde, Eddie Van Halen, Jimi Hendrix even (does the opening of Broken Wings remind anyone else of him?), you won't be disappointed.  Tremonti belongs in the ranks with those guys.  He goes through so many styles, sounds, etc. in this album, it's simply amazing.

I can't really think of much to say about this movie, but just that it's cool. That's all I can really say to describe this movie. It is not boring, or anything either. You will be entertained the whole time!
6305131090|5.0|Ken Russell was a controversial, daring and bold director of modernism back in the late 60's and through the 70's. His films were disturbing to watch for many and so crammed with bizarre symbolism that it appeared to be inspired by hallucinations triggered by drug abuse. The horror film \\"The Devils\\" from 1971 was about witchcraft, Satanism and the Black Plague in early Renaissance France in which Vannessa Redgrave played a blasphemous nun. \\"Tommy\\" was a rock opera depicting the drug cultre and rock of the 70's. Lisztomania was a bio epic with a bizarre comic book twist on the life of pianist and composer Franz Liszt. Of all his films, Mahler is Russell's most restrained and most beautiful. It has minimal twists and bizarre symbols, except for the appropriate sections - the opening in which Mahler is dreaming of his wife as a struggling creature in a cocoon, witnessing his own death and his wife dancing over his grave and taking on lovers and the silent movie \\"The Convert\\" about Cosima Wagner converting Mahler from Jew to Catholic. This scene is hilarious as Cosima Wagner plays a Nazi dominatrix forcing him to eat pig (Still Kosher ?)making a parody of Wagner opera and the scene concludes with their singing of The Ride Of The Valkyries.  <br /> <br />The true meat of the film is the music being used for the right scenes. Even an allusion to Visconti's version of A Death In Venice by Thomas Mann is made early in the film. There are many fine moments in the film. Among them is the scene in which Alma, Mahler's wife, buries her husband's 10th Symphony Score or perhaps something else that was never discovered to the romantic strains of Wagner's Liebestod from Tristan and Isolde. Cosima Wagner is the villain in the film, portrayed as a seductive, dark, mysterious temptress. Mahler did in fact convert to Catholicism simply to get the job of conductor of the Vienna State Opera. Anti-Semitism was a popular movement during this time and Cosima Wagner, the widow of the late Richard Wagner, was notoriously Anti-Semitic. Another powerful scene is Mahler explaining Heaven and Hell, angels and demons to his two daughters. Illustrations by Gustav Dore are depicted. Also moving is the scene towards the end in which Alma protects her daughters from a coming storm and from the allure of the evil Cosima Wagner who apparently has already bewitched Mahler. The conflicts of the film are two: Mahler and his inner conflict. He was Jewish, betrayed his faith to gain fame as conductor (He was the lead conductor of the world next to Arturo Toscanini in the Metropolitan Opera of New York City during the 1908-1910 seasons.) His obscession with Death, his fascination with the natural world and the loss of children's innocence, hence his work for voice Songs On The Death Of Children. The music here from the symphonies is well done and conducted by Bernard Haitink. It is a beautiful if bizarre film.
0671799320|4.0|Yergin does a great job in writing an informative AND easy to read book.  There is little technical jargon to get in the way of the story he tells.  \\"The Prize\\" is not onlyinformative,it is also entertaining, especially the cast of characters, ranging form Rockefeller to Bush the Elder (there is a great picture of G.W. Bush as a little boy standing next to his father at an unveiling of an oil facility).  There are a few problems, however.  First, although it is already over 800 pages long, the book deserves to be longer.  More on the Soviet experience in oil, and a focus on pre-Saddam Iraq and other oil producers outside the Persian Gulf would have been welcome.  Second, as other reviewers have mentioned,it would be great to see an updated edition come out.  The world has changed a lot since the end of Gulf War ( I think the book ends before the collapse of the USSR, but I may be wrong) and I would be very intersted in reading what Yergin has to write about it.  Third, while Yergin does discuss many aspects of the international oil scene,it seems to me that his account focuses on the Anglo-American experience a little too much.  This stems partly from the pact that America and Britain were the power players in oil for so long, but it would still be nice to see how the oil drama played out elsewhere in the world.  My final issue with this otherwise wonderful book is has to do with politics and economics.  It is obvious that Yergin was trying to write a \\"fair and balanced\\" account of the history of oil.  However, as someone who has been influenced by free-market economics,it is difficult for me not to point out the relationship between oil companies and governments.  Whether it is Mexico nationalizing oil wells or New Dealers suing American oil companies for practices the New Dealers themselves encouraged, \\"The Prize\\" tells a story of various governments using every method, fair and foul (usually foul), to pump ,pun intended, oil comapnies out of as much money as possible.  The most obivous examples are the nationalizations of oil companies' property in the Middle East,Iran, Mexico,and Venezuela.  This is not meant to defend the oil companies as angels of all that is good: they too engage in political rent seeking when it promised more money or power.  But, it becomes very easy to see towards the end of the book who really calls the shots in the oil industry.  All in all,\\"The Prize\\" is entertaing and informative and makes a great summer read
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Ok, first:  I understand why some think of this as trash, and I even understand why some find it unintentionally funny.  This isn't great art, and in the best conceptions time-travel is full of logical fallacies. <br /><br /> <br /><br />However, I'm still giving this four stars.  (I'd give it 3.5 if Amazon would let me).  Why?  Because I was riveted!  never bored, holding my breath, hoping for a good outcome.  Maybe it was a little more sombre than it needed to be (did we really have to include pedophilia, dog immolation, mom-and-baby murder and quadraplegia??  wait, I left out prison rape!) and at times even with my \\"skeptic\\" lights off I wanted to chuckle at some of the bizarre consequences (kind of like a photonegative of It's a Wonderful Life, where Donna Reed without George would be... a librarian!  the end of the film is a little bit over the top in how much better things will be if...) <br /><br /> <br /><br />BUT.  I go to the movies (or rent them, in this case) for ENTERTAINMENT.  Not for enlightenment (and the add-ons are pretty lame; the \\"documentaries\\" about chaos theory include about 3 talking heads speaking in generalities.  Steven Hawking it ain't) <br /><br /> <br /><br />And I found myself WITH IT all the way.  Wishing against wish that he'd just Get It Right this time.  Wondering what next?   <br /><br /> <br /><br />I actually loved that there was some mystery leftover-- that we never do know exactly what happened to his father and grandfather.  (Nor is it ever explained why Evan wouldn't have heard about some of the things he didn't remember, but never mind.)   <br /><br /> <br /><br />I found myself still thinking about the movie long after it was over, and had at least one nightmare about it. <br /><br /> <br /><br />any movie that has that effect on me is doing SOMETHING right.   <br /><br /> <br /><br />It's a good thriller for a rainy day!
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|great direction (i love clint) terrific acting.  sean penn is masterful; what an actor!!!  the movie goes deeply into the far reaching affects of early trauma.  the character developmenet in this movie is very very good.  true to life, the movie doesn't have a clean clear, happy, hollywood ending.  it leaves you wondering what direction these peoples lives will take.  maybe a bit too cerebral for some moviegoers who prefer the clear cut characters to wear white or black hats and the guy with the black hat gets it in the end, not these confusing characters with hats that are shades of gray.  this movie is different and i liked it a lot.  i would have given it 5 stars if i'd have felt more uplifted or pleased or something.  more pleasure for the brain that for the heart.
B00000JNJ1|5.0|In the contest of who has sunk lower, Rod or Sting.  I put my vote to Rod simply because he had farther to fall.  THey are both now rock bottom doing the afternoon talk show circuit.  At least Rod never bored us with tales of how he could have sex for 8 hours because of his Yoga practice.  I guess I still like Rod even if he sucks now.  Probably he knows it whereas Sting probably still thinks he is great.  Oh yeah, this CD The FAces \\"Good BOys When They're Asleep\\" is fantastic.
B00006F7S4|5.0|As Beck continues his interest in disastrous cover art, his music just keeps getting sweeter. While comparisons between new male songwriters and Bob Dylan have grown extremely tired at this point, likening Beck's \\"Sea Change\\" to Dylan's \\"Blood on the Track\\" seems particularly appropriate here, even turning up some distinctly Dylanesque lyrics whose tough physical images evoke the shadows of songs like \\"It's All Over Now Baby Blue\\": \\"Leave you here wearing your wounds/Waving your guns at somebody new,\\" Beck croons on about the unnamed object of his distress. While Beck's impressive heritage comes through quite clearly throughout these flawless odes to loss -- Hank Williams, Neil Young, Gordon Lightfoot -- the man nevertheless manages to maintain a necessary artistic distance from these overbearing specters. Vivid and biting language such as \\"You're all scared and stiff/a sick stolen gift\\" or \\"yellow roses in the graveyard/got time to watch them grow\\" evoke an emotional landscape entirely his own.  Hardly \\"overproduced,\\" this album marks a refreshing and radical departure from the overwrought catastrophe that was \\"Midnight Vultures.\\" Tasteful, reserved and vulnerable, Beck's \\"Sea Change\\" confronts the past: both the bruises of its memories and the dreams of its pleasures. Beck's gorgeously desolate vocals float amid an undualting and broken sea of loss, adjustment and strength. \\"Nothing's measured by what it needs,\\" Beck suggests toward the end of the set. Well, that may apply to many experiences in life, but \\"Sea Change,\\" to the contrary, is both the measure and the need, the question and the answer -- the spot in the soul that only a good meal or first kiss hits.
B00005JMAH|5.0|My wife and I both loved this movie. She filled in the things that happened in the book that weren't in the movie, but in truth I don't think the fact that the movie didn't cover all the Quidditch match and a couple other things hurt the movie. My wife agreed and she has read all the books at least twice. If you resolve yourselve to voting negative on movies that don't equal the book, you will be voting negative on every movie ever made. They just can't do the books justice. It is physically impossible. So either stick to only reading books or be forgiving of the imperfection of movies. Now once you realize that you can start enjoying the movies for what they are, a nice rendition of part of the book that you can actually see on a big screen.<br /><br />Put yourself in the directors shoes, you can't make this movie to long or people will get bored. Now you must make it exciting and different from the previous movies, so you leave out things that have all ready been done such as a important Quidditch match. To be honest if I had to sit through a big Quidditch match again I might have walked out of the movie. It isn't that I dislike Quidditch, I just don't see the point of eating up movie time in every Harry Potter movie with a match. I say bravo director for cutting the match out and showing the things that were important and new. Anyone that says this wasn't exciting and fresh, is missing something. The addition of new characters and the new storyline was fascinating to me. I loved how they let me realize what was really going on. After the initial introduction of the chain of events I had my suspicions but it was unveiled to me in a delightful way that did not spoil anything.<br /><br />I loved the creatures added in this movie and the more adult storyline. After all Harry is growing older just like he does in the books. The tension builds like in the previous movies but this story was darker yet stronger than the previous movies. Don't get me wrong each movie has something that makes it special. I enjoy the child like innocence in the first two movies. Although that is no longer present here, it does not mean that this and future movies will not have a different more adult quality that are appealing. Just don't be surprised if the very small children don't enjoy them quite as much. Not recommended for small children since some early scenes will frighten them and not be explained till late in the movie.<br /><br />I realize most children will give me negative votes because they can't possibly comprehend that the movie can't be made exactly like the book. It's the adults that worry me. They should understand an inkling of what goes into making a movie and yet they freely criticize directors and studios as though it would have been a piece of cake to make the movie just like the book. I suggest you pay closer attention. Name me any three movies that are exactly like the books. Now if you somehow managed to come up with three, how many of those were hits at the box office? John Grisham, Thomas Harris, and Michael Crichton are three authors that books and movies are great. We all know though that the movies were not exactly like the books. The movies never are exactly like the books. This movie is no exception to that, and it is still a great movie well worth seeing and owning on DVD.makes it special.

B000056N8X|3.0|I know he was killed in Highlander 2 but this one really needed Connery in it and it shows. He brought a charm to the movies; and I am sure many will disagree with me, he made me want to watch more about his character.  So much so he overshadowed the supposed main character.  I like Adrain Paul. I don't think he carried the movie too well.<br /><br />The film writers and producers couldn't decide who would take the lead.  While not a total waste of time bear in mind it does have some good sword battles so it's not a total loss.  It's 2004 and I doubt there will be another sequel unless a good script comes across the producers' desk.  I do have to agree it was too predictable from the start.  A good audience could tell what was going to happen from one scene to the next.  It was more of an assembly line movie than Highlander 1 or 2.  The villian didn't have so much depth like any of the others.  If you look at any of the others and I can't comment on the third one because I never saw it...The villains weren't just one note.  The first one had very good dialogue and so did the second one.  There's less passion here and more by the numbers.

078322611X|5.0|Ray Kinsella teaches us all a little about how to trust that what God asks us to do is right for us, and that he will take care of us for doing it. Think of that incredible shot with the streams of cars driving into Iowa City to watch a Baseball game of thier dreams; that is miraculous.<br /><br />The work upon which this movie is based is more of a short story and is a great appendix for this movie. The story takes yo to the first meeting of Kinsella and Shoeless Joe, and ends there. The writers of the movie took the wonderful basis of the story and turned it into a full legnth screenplay, by adding more wonderful characters like Doc Gramm and Ray's brother-in-law, and more revelations from \\"the voice\\" (interstingly played by \\"himself\\" as he is credited).<br /><br />Definately a 10 and a great night of entertainment.
B000002AH1|4.0|I bought this on my travels in Leipzig and it has to go down as probably one of the odder CDs I've bought. While I've always enjoyed Miles Davis' work when I'm in the mood - I've never really bought any of his stuff until last year ( you'd have to excuse me on that part since his backcatalogue is rather daunting ). The very fact that half the album is live and half the album is recorded in the studio. How it meshed so well I don't know. The album can be very noisy but also have subdued quiet moments. I suppose if you were to look at it in one light - it's an album of contradictions that sit perfectly with each other. There's not really much else that I can say about this album except that when I am in the mood for this album it has to be listened as a whole because that's the whole experience of it and it would be only tainted otherwise.
B000286RKW|5.0|Let's face it, no mafia/gangster movie is ever going to top the first two Godfather movies, but Goodfellas comes as close as anything can to The Godfather I & II.  <br />It does have advantage Coppola's masterpiece doesn't have, though: It is a true story.  <br />I can't wait to hear Scorsese's and Henry Hill's commentaries. <br />As a gangster movie connoisseur, I gotta go with Godfather I, Godfather II, Scarface (with Pacino), and Goodfellas, in that order. But let's wait and see how the rest of the first season of A & E's Growing Up Gotti goes, and I may have to add it to this list (kidding!). <br />
B00000IQC8|5.0|\\"Clerks,\\" director/writer Kevin Smith's film-making debut, shot after-hours in the convenience store he worked in, on a shoe-string budget, with various friends playing random parts, is pure comic gold. It has struck a chord with so many people (mostly Gen-X slackers) for a reason: it's honest, and unrelentingly hilarious. Shot in completely black & white, \\"Clerks\\" has a down-home, gritty feeling that works well (even if unintentionally) with the tone of the film. The movie revolves around a day in the life of two clerks who also happen to be friends: Dante, who runs the convenience store (Quik Stop), is a self-pitying everyday joe, stuck in a rut. Randall is almost his polar opposite. He runs the video-store next door and although both hate their jobs, Randall seems to find the fun in it, while Dante seems to focus on the drama of everything in his life --from arguing with his girlfriend about school, to pining for a past flame, to simply being degraded on a day to day basis. Most of their time is spent inside Quik Stop, while Randall keeps would-be customers locked outside for half of the day. They anger customers with their foul language (well, Randall does), they close the store to play hockey on the roof (only to return 12 minutes later after losing the ball) and to go to a wake, learn about \\"snowballing\\" and even find a surprise in the employee bathroom. For all of it's vulgar humor, \\"Clerks\\" is very easy to relate to and enjoy, and for anyone who has had a job serving the public, much of what is presented in this movie rings true. This movie is a landmark to not only me, but to every Kevin Smith fan. His great sense of humor and talent for writing interesting dialogue for his characters is all established in this one movie. Not to mention it also marks the debut of the infamous Jay & Silent Bob. If you hate your job, or are finding yourself in a rut, \\"Clerks\\" may be the movie you need to see. The DVD is only satisfactory. The alternate ending is, well, interesting to say the least, and the commentary with Kevin Smith & crew is always interesting -- be sure to keep an ear out for Jason Mewes (Jay) falling asleep during the recording session.sting to say the least, and the commentary with Kevin Smith & crew is always interesting -- be sure to keep an ear out for Jason Mewes (Jay) falling asleep during the recording session.

0679720200|5.0|Camus' character, Meursault, commits a senseless murder and is executed for it.  A Camus fantasy?  Or would a white man really have been executed for killing an Arab (Moor)in N. Africa during what I presume was the late 1930s?  The book first appeared in 1942.  Had the setting been the USA during the same period, Meursault would've probably never even gone to trial.  Maybe this says something about the difference between the colonialists and the racist slave holders in the USA.

We had always hoped for a sequel of movies with the original actors: Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher with R2-D2 and C-3PO.<br />  Instead, George Lucas decided 22 years later to make prequels (the story before the original story we saw in 1977).  So as a result of this, in 1997, the original films were re-issued with the name change of STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE (1977/97) .  THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK now is Episode V (5) and RETURN OF THE JEDI, now is Episode VI (6).  New special effects and footage were included.<br />  The brand new film STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE (1999) (Followed by STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES [2002] and STAR WARS III: REVENGE OF THE SITH [2005]) was a disappointment to me, the excitement just was not there. Special effects are entertaining, but didn't care for the storytelling. I don't like Samuel L. Jackson and I can not stand Jar Jar Binks.<br />  Seeing the story of Yoda before STAR WARS (1977) is interesting to me.  So what is this film about?

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Many people review this show coming from the \\"I'm a Joss Whedon Fan\\" standpoint, so I thought it was time for a different point of view.  I never watched Buffy or Angel.  I was not against them, I just never felt that I should make time to watch it. So when a friend of mine who has never failed in introducing me to great stuff recommended Firefly, I borrowed his DVDs and that was the first time I can remember seeing the name Joss Whedon.  About 5 minutes after the opening credits on Serenity, I was hooked.  The initial battle scene is good and has some dark humor, but it was a moment right after that where I realized this was going to be a great show.  In the very beginning they break into an abandoned spacecraft.  The way they do it is with some sort of gel that, when they shine a laser on it, melts through the hatch.  What got me was that it was completely silent.  No explosions, as there is no oxygen to burn in space, no sound, as there is no air to carry sound.  That made the series for me.  It is apparent that a lot of time and effort had gone into making this show look and feel real.  CGI shots are unsteady not because of bad effects but because its supposed to look like it was shot with a handheld camera.  A new world was created by this show, and unlike many sci fi shows, this one is very believable because it all makes sense and the focus is on the people, not the sci fi. There is never a problem that consists of \\"Tachyons\\" that is fixed by a \\"Beta radiation pulse.\\" (I liked Star Trek, but lets face it, how do you relate to a subatomic particle?)   This is a show that takes place in the future, its not about the future, and that is what makes it so good.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I'm glad the first real anime film I ever watched was \\"Princess Mononoke.\\" I never, or almost never, watch anything animated anymore, so stumbling over this brilliant piece of art was fortuitous to say the least. I'm not usually one to buy into hype, but the blazing blurbs on the DVD cover, trumpeting this movie as the most wonderful piece of anime ever made, did convince me to rent it for an evening. So did the gazillions of praiseworthy comments I subsequently found after viewing the film. The fact that several big shot Hollywood actors-including Billy Bob Thornton, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver, and Claire Danes-provided the voices of the characters almost scared me away from this picture. I figured that the only reason these actors signed on to the project revolved around the idea that the central theme of the movie concerned industrialization versus nature. Well, it probably was the driving force for these actors, but you can look beyond all that and just enjoy the film anyway. And trust me, you'll love \\"Princess Mononoke.\\" Set in medieval Japan, the movie is complex, beautiful, and inspiring.<br /><br />Young Prince Ashitaka runs into a big problem when he suffers a serious injury after battling a frighteningly evil creature outside his small village. The wound, a bite mark on his arm, is incurable according to the village doctor. Ashitaka will eventually morph into a demon unless he can somehow find the elusive Princess Mononoke, a human raised in the wild, who may know how to cure this dreaded disease. Leaving the village is difficult for the young prince because local tradition dictates that he may never return. On his trip into the wilds of nature, Ashitaka runs into a mysterious monk named Jigo, stumbles into a war zone, and discovers a fabulous metal works factory run by the beautiful Lady Eboshi. It turns out that this factory, staffed largely by women, produces guns and ammunition for the samurai armies. Eboshi doesn't limit herself to only dealing with one customer, however, as she is a dedicated capitalist willing to sell armaments to anyone with money. When Ashitaka finally meets Mononoke he discovers that the denizens of the forest are attempting to fight back against Eboshi's machinations. Obviously, Ashitaka must decide which side to take in the battle for the earth. He is torn between giving into his love for Mononoke or battling the humans.<br /><br />\\"Princess Mononoke\\" is much more than a simple action tale, although there are plenty of intense combat sequences. Love plays a big part in the story, between Ashitaka and Mononoke as well as a love for the purity of nature. Malice rears its ugly head, too. Not only is Eboshi filled with odium, but so is Mononoke as she battles the humans destroying the wilderness. It's to the film's credit that it never takes a black or white view of either humans or animals. Each side has an ugly aspect that often emerges in startling ways. The movie eventually seems to say that humans need to forget about dominating nature and instead find their own niche within it. Still, there can be little doubt about where the filmmakers' sympathies lie. All of the greatest scenes in the movie involve Ashitaka's interactions with nature and the animals. The animators pulled out all the stops in presenting a truly magical world. Pay special attention to the wondrous nature god's awe-inspiring transformations and the little forest apparitions that appear to guide Ashitaka through the forest. These scenes constitute the finest animation I have ever seen, animation that should rightfully carry the tag \\"art\\" more often than not.<br /><br />The only problem I had with the film concerned some of the voiceovers. I thought Billy Crudup did a fine job as the heroic Ashitaka. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Claire Danes's work as Mononoke. I continually felt this actress had no conception of her character or how to convincingly vocalize her attributes. I began todevelop a distinct sense of dread every time Mononoke opened her mouth. As for the other American actors, they did an acceptable job. Thornton did better than I thought he would as the voice of the wily Jigo, considering this actor's southern accent, but then again the monk doesn't appear too often in the movie. Only after I watched the movie and returned it did I think about viewing it in Japanese with subtitles. I suspect that would have been a better way to see this film. These criticisms in no way require me to give \\"Princess Mononoke\\" less than five stars.<br /><br />The DVD edition of the film does contain a few extras, including some interviews with the American actors voicing some of the characters, a trailer, and a widescreen presentation. I didn't think animation would use widescreen, but what do I know? \\"Princess Mononoke\\" doubtless appeals to fans of the anime genre, but it should have an equal effect on non-fans. I know I couldn't believe some of the stuff I was seeing in this movie-yes, it's that powerfully beautiful. I wouldn't just watch this one again; I'm thinking about buying myself a copy. That's how much I liked the darn thing. Maybe I ought to start watching more anime in the near future.gan to develop a distinct sense of dread every time Mononoke opened her mouth.

B0000A1RJI|5.0|Shortly after walking out of the movie, I found myself humming the theme without realizing that I was doing it... it was then, I decided that I better get the soundtrack. <br /> <br />Over a year since its release, I still have a tendency to often pull this soundtrack out when looking for something to listen to as I work. It is, by far, one of the best soundtracks that I own (which now total a little over four hundred titles) and is the most memorable. Perhaps this is because the main theme is sewn throughout the entire soundtrack, much the same way the main theme was in the soundtrack for the original SPEED movie or for Indiana Jones & the Raiders of the Lost Ark. <br /> <br />Given a choice of soundtracks for the past five years, I have to say that this is the best one, even blowing away such competition as the Matrix Reloaded Score.  <br /> <br />If you want a soundtrack that is just plain fun to listen to, to close your eyes and picture yourself embarking on a swashbuckling journey of piracy and love, then let this soundtrack be your ticket... but word of warning, mates, you'll soon feel an urge to load the treasure of the movie in your DVD player... so venture at your own risk! <br />
B0002234LS|4.0|Let it be known that Secret Window is as predictable as thrillers get and would usually be a movie I despise. Then why didn't I? For one, Secret Window is very well-made; creepy and effective and wonderfully shot. Johnny Depp is superb as always, and is joined by a great cast, which includes the beautiful Maria Bello, John Turturro, Charless Dutton, and Timothy Hutton. <br /> <br />The suspense manages to build, slowly and steadily, to a very creepy, but predictable and unsatisfactory conclusion. Some may guess the twist long before the end credits, but even so, it's a chilling denouement and guaranteed to keep you in suspense until the somewhat ambiguous ending. <br /> <br />All the performances are solid and the entire film makes an atmospheric use of handsome woodland and lakeside settings. Johnny Depp is an incredibly versatile actor and never disappoints with a performance. John Turturro does a memorable job as the man claiming to be the true author and Timothy Hutton is effective as the man who has stolen the affection of Depp's ex-wife. Mario Bello isn't given much to do but she is perfect as Depp's ex-wife and Charles Dutton never gives a bad performance. All of the proceedings are enhanced by Phil Glass' subtle background score. <br /> <br />Overall, the film is well worth watching if you're a fan of Johnny Depp and enjoy a good mystery with a not so shocking twist.  <br />
B00005JN2F|4.0|I was prepared to not like Bourne II, having been warned of the fast cuts.  But they were so well done that (to me) it made perfect sense.  If any of the incidents depicted were to happen in real life the first thing people would say was \\"It all happened so fast...\\"<br /><br />Matt Damon is perfect for this because he's not cute enough to be a distraction.  Imagine Ben Affleck crashing a car and then dissapearing into a crowd in Moscow.<br /><br />Although the plot is 100% predictable the movie is fun and my 20 minute test came and went (this is when I check my watch).<br /><br />So enjoy.  And let me also reccomend the somewhat less sophisticated The Transporter.  If you're looking for Sophie's Choice, neither of these will appeal to you but but trust me, both pass the 20 minute test easily.

He also does an excellent job in getting the reader to empathize with a fundamentally unsympathetic character--even though I found myself often frustrated and annoyed with Chris in tandem with his fictional caregivers. Not recommended for anyone unsure about having kids!
B000059TEQ|4.0|Contrary to popular belief, Love Story is not based on a novel by Erich Segal. Author Erich Segal wrote the screenplay first, then adapted it into a novel - which was quickly published before the film's release and became a runaway bestseller.      In 1970, Love Story took the nation by storm and made stars out of Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw. By today's standards, the story has been done so often and so much more dramatically, it seems a bit dated. The film has become very overrated over the years, but it still manages to be a sweet, effective love story, just not as tear enducing as some people say.     With that said, I enjoyed the film a lot. The two leads have wonderful chemistry and deliver powerful performances. The haunting theme has gone down in history and is one of the most recognizable in all of film. It is a beautiful piece that lingers in the mind and is very difficult to forget.    While \\"Love Story\\" is certainly a pleasant movie, aside from the tragic ending, and one that I enjoy watching, especially for Ali MacGraw's beautiful smile, it is only slightly above average. It of course coined the phrase \\"love means never having to say you're sorry\\", which sounds good but in fact is worthless tripe. Anyone who knows what love really is also knows the value, the importance of saying \\"I'm sorry\\" when it is warranted. However it is amazing how many people latched on to this phrase, just because it was in a movie.    This is one of the first films, if not the first, of its kind, and spawned many imitators. It doesn't have the effect I assume it had over thirty years ago, but as far as sappy romances go, this is one of the best I've seen. Worth a watch for its classic status and Best Picture nomination alone. Doesn't hurt that it was also the film debut of a young Tommy Lee Jones.
B00005JKQ6|3.0|This is an interesting premise and Burt Lancaster is as usual, superb.  That said, this film is monutmentally depressing, made all the more so by the fact that as things progress they go steadily downhill.<br /><br />Add to this schlockmeister supreme Martin HAMlisch's overpowering score and, well, things can't get much grimmer.<br /><br />What can I say?  Fire up the popcorn and remember things  always appear darkest before going entirely black.
B000000OPZ|5.0|This is definately a pop metal masterpiece, this is a hardrockin album that has many great songs. The music is a very up-beat in songs like Crying in the Rain, Bad Boys, Children of the Night, Straight for the Heart, and very laid back when it needs to be, such as Here I Go Again, Is This Love, and Don't Turn Away. You know the year, 1987, rebellion, sex, drugs, and free love were all very popular to young teens as well as the hair metal bands musical theme, which is the basic concept theme of this album, most of the lyrics written by guitarist John Skyes, who has a very great style of guitar playing, very melodic and very complex, if you want to compare him to Pantera's Dimebag Darell, it's very possible, just in a more laid back form. David Coverdale, in my opinion is a great vocalist, very melodic, and soaring singing that you will hear as well, very comparable to Tony Martin, who was the front man of Black Sabbath at one time. This album contains probably some of the most played hits from WhiteSnake, Here I Go Again is still a big radio hit today in the 2000's, and also Is This Love, very popular among the easy listening of the 80's stations. This a great metal album and is worthy of anyones collection, and I suggest that you stop reading my review and get it now.
B00005NWM3|1.0|This stuff is bad. Just earsplitting noise. Save your <br />money and eardrums.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The outcome of this movie is known to all before they see the movie. The bride will get her revenge and `Kill Bill'. As in many Alfred Hitchcock movies, the suspense is not in the outcome, but how we get there. And, in this movie, the itinerary is well worth the trip. Unfortunately, this means I have to be very circumspect in what I say to avoid giving away any of the key plot points.<br /><br />I've never thought critically about any of Quentin Tarantino's earlier films, so I'm not sure whether this is true of all his movies or just this one, but I get the very strong impression that Tarantino's main directoral influences are Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah, with a seasoning of Akira Kurasawa thrown in for good measure. There are long shots with no dialogue which strongly remind me of similar atmosphere shots in `Once Upon a Time in the West'. Also, like Peckinpah in `The Wild Bunch', there is a strong sense of inevitability in the fate of the band of outlaws lead by William Holden and Earnest Borgnine, and dialogue and scenes are taut with the tension of waiting to see how things will all play out.<br /><br />I sensed the influence of Leone as I was watching the film, and this was confirmed in a big way when I saw that several pieces of music by Enno Morricone for `A Fistful of Dollars' was used in the sound track. This confirms my sense that Tarantino shares with Stanley Kubrick and Woody Allan a great talent for borrowing music from other contexts and using it to good advantage in his movies. I was strongly reminded of scenes from the very 1960's feature length documentary `Mondo Cane' in one scene of `Kill Bill', which was no surprise at all when I saw that a piece of music was borrowed from that 40 year old movie for the scene. I really wonder if Tarantino was just lucky with one audience member, or whether he was really being that subtle in evoking a movie obscure to about 80% of his audience.<br /><br />It has been said in many reviews that the casting of David Carradine as Bill was a stroke of genius, bringing to mind his long run as a character in the TV series `Kung Fu'. I will add that Carradine does very well by the part even without that historical connection. All of the other actors execute their parts equally well, with a special kudo to Darryl Hannah for playing a really quirky scene where a large part of her monologue is read from hand-printed notes neatly written in a 3 by 5 inch spiral bound notebook. This piece of business is a small taste of the constantly different way of doing things that Tarantino pulls off better than I have ever seen it done. He does things which, if other directors try it, they take short cuts, and the business falls flat on its face. Tarantino takes no short cuts with important business. The scene between Hannah and Michael Madsen echos the overall course of the whole movie. You are certain that Hannah's character will double cross `Bud', Bill's brother played by Madsen, but you don't have a clue how she will do it. Her method, when revealed, suddenly seems incredibly obvious in the context of the movie.<br /><br />Unlike the final episode of `The Lord of the Rings', which wraps up a story spanning three movies, `Kill Bill Volume 2' can be viewed with little or no loss if you did not see `Kill Bill Volume 1'; however, one of the things which makes it so much better a movie than Volume 1 is the fact that the central plot of the two movies is resolved, and resolved with much less over the top martial arts scenes than in the first part.<br /><br />`Kill Bill Volume 2' is as good or better than any of his other movies, yet, it may not be as enjoyable to watch as `Pulp Fiction'. Key situations are equally as taut, but in spite of the `graphic novel' inspiration behind `Kill Bill', there is none of the `this is really all make believe' sense you have while watching `Pulp Fiction'. The title, after all, does give away the fact that this is storytelling. The grimness and `film noir' feelingin `Kill Bill' is accentuated by the odd red-green emphasis in the color print which I always associate with the filming of `The Matrix'. It adds to the brooding atmosphere of the movie, but I still don't like it. The recollection scenes in plain black and white are almost a relief to watch. It adds to the movie, but I could do without it.<br /><br />Like `Reservoir Dogs' and `Pulp Fiction', the time line jumps around between the main plot line and flashbacks, but every flashback is very cleverly tied into the explanation of a key plot point. While the technique gives me headaches in the hands of some directors, Tarantino has honed it to a fine edge.<br /><br />A must see movie if you like Tarantino or Peckinpah or Kurasawa or film noir. There is a lot less blood and violence than in Part I, so there may actually be less to put off squeamish viewers.r' feeling in `Kill Bill' is accentuated by the odd red-green emphasis in the color print which I always associate with the filming of `The Matrix'.

B0001NBMBC|3.0|From 1999 to 2002 Slipknot's self-titled debut and \\"Iowa\\" were just about the only two CD's I ever listened to. I would listen to both of those CD's repeatedly before ever giving other CD's a shot. They were amazing, raw, and an all out attack. <br /> <br />Vol. 3 is amazing in some ways but the raw nature to Slipknot is gone. The all out attack has fallen way to a few punches that land heavy but never deliver the knock-out blow. \\"The Blister Exists\\" is the stand-out track of the album, most similar to anything on it's previous work, Slipknot delivers an innovative sound and a mix of Taylor's screams and vocals. Sadly, the album peaks at song #2. \\"Duality\\", \\"Opium Of The People\\" and \\"Vermillion\\" are all very good songs, but they are not what Slipknot could have made. The progression of the band certainly was needed to not make a duplicate of 'Iowa' or 'Slipknot' before it. The total change though,  comes across more as weak more than innovative and the only time the album really hits hard again is #12 \\"The Nameless\\". The first minute of the song is exactly what you'd hear on the first Slipknot CD, ruined or made better (depending on your point of view) Taylor than breaks the song down into a chorus of harmony and verses of thrash and insanity, it's only on this song where Slipknot briefly captures what they are. Slipknot. This is a good CD for it's genre, but it's blends in with the rest of the rock/metal world much more than either of the first two albums. Albums that, looks like will never be touched in terms of raw energy, emotion and drive.
B000002P5R|5.0|I purchased this album when it first came out, while I was in college in Northern California. I had been really into Jimi Hendrix and listened to his albums every night on headphones, how I truly believe they were meant to be heard.  <br /> <br />Most notable on this album is a never-before-heard song called Drifting, which is actually my favorite Jimi Hendrix song, overall. I can't seem to find much history of the song (whether he wrote it or not, for example), but regardless of whether he wrote it or not, the guitar work is absolutely amazing. I don't say this lightly. After the first 1:40 of the song, Jimi goes into 2 full minutes of multiple layers of the most pleasant, relaxing, creative, beautiful guitar work I've ever heard. Panning from right to left, fading in and out, recorded and then added backwards, the whole nine yards. Truly amazing work. Over 7 years later and I still listen to it weekly and discover something new. It's so deep that without a good set of headphones you're missing out.  <br /> <br />Also notable is Hey Baby (New Rising Sun), which leaves me speechless as well.
B00000JGHM|5.0|If you're into crime dramas with star studded lineups then this is the film for you. The plotline itself is pretty basic - cops & robbers, except its cops & robbers starring pacino and deniro. Aside from having one of the greatest shootout scenes ever, the acting from the entire cast is top notch. The characters are presented to us with great depth which explains certain decisions they make as well as the conditions of how they carry out their lives. And of course, the scene with Pacino and Deniro conversing with each other at the diner is movie making history. Overall, pretty awesome.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I am going to come out and say that I had quite low expectations for this film, starring That 70's Show boytoy Ashton Kutcher, and couldn't see much more out of him than the moron he plays <br />on the show, but I was pleasantly surprised by his performance.  I'm not saying that he's the next big thing, but he suited the role (roles?) well. <br /> <br />I am not going to go into depth about the plot, but I will say that the movie revolves around the mishaps that the main character Evan gets himself into as he \\"plays god.\\"  It delves into the world of chaos theory, which states that the inherent instability of the universe makes the prediction of the future too complex to even comprehend slightly, a.k.a. one small thing leads to huge, possibly catastrophic changes down the road.  As one thing leads to another he realizes that he cannot change things for what to him seems to be the better, and continually digs himself deeper and deeper into the mess which he created for himself, until the end of the movie, which the ending(s) I will not reveal.  Sounds simple on paper but when played out becomes slightly more complex then the average Hollywood flick dares to be.  Of course, there are some minor (and major) plot holes, but their only purpose is to keep the plot tangible and if it were to be 100% scientifically accurate, there would be an endless web of events which would simply confuse the viewer.  All in all, the director managed to keep the plot interesting, yet understandable.  Excellent flick.  I give it 5 stars for an excellent cast, interesting plot, and of course, a personal bias; an interest in chaos theory.

B00005JMAH|2.0|First, the positives. <br /> <br />The film is certainly nice to look at.  The trio has also improved their acting skills quite nicely.  And the additions to the cast--Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, etc.--were all fantastic. <br /> <br />But to me, this film was a disappointment.  There were so many things that were left out and/or not explained that I spent the entire time wondering what was going on even though I'd read the book (for the umpteeth time)only the previous week. <br /> <br />No explanation of the Marauder's Map, which is vital to the plot of the book and explains how Professor Lupin (and Sirius Black, for that matter) knows so much about Harry's parents.  The grounds of Hogwarts was completely different from the first two movies.  The kids were dressed in Muggle clothing (which actually wasn't all that bad, although Hermione looked like a Pink Power Ranger).  The script writer gave Hermione all of Ron's lines and made her sound completely out of character.  Ugh.   <br /> <br />I understand that they could not include everything in the book but the things they left out made the movie seem chopped up--or like a puzzle where someone had put the pieces all back in the wrong order and tried to pass it off as the original picture. <br /> <br />I hate to think of the people who had never read the book.  I'm sure they were wondering what the heck was going on most of the time. <br /> <br />Overall, nice to look at, but disappointing for those that like to stick to canon.

This is based on the $84 for the first season.  I have all the episodes on tape.  I will probably purchase the dvds for the sound and picture quality.  But, I'm not stupid enough to fall for this.
B00004R7TP|5.0|I was only one year old when this album was released.  I grew up with Kate, as my parents were avid fans, but never understood her importance until my teens.  Imagine being a toddler, and spinning around to \\"Jig of Life.\\" Kate is the most powerful, and often misunderstood, figures in the modern era of popular music.  Kudos to her for a courageous career!  I hear she's working on another album...?   <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor; make this milestone part of your collection.  If you don't get it the first time, listen more intensely; meditate on it.  Read the lyrics.  You'll figure it out.  Dare I say, God's voice through music?  :)
0812550706|5.0|This is one of the best if not the best Sci Fi novel every written. While the begining of the book is really boring, it more than makes up for it in the middle and at the end. You'll be turning each page wondering what will happen next. The ending is wonderful. I recommend any fans of adventure or Sci Fi go to your local book store this is instance and pick this book up.
0140293469|5.0|Men, when reading this book will be nodding their head and smiling. This is a book that is funny, true to life and hard to put down. Robs interactions with his women, family and work mates are hilarious. Saw the movie before I read the book, loved the John Cusacks worrysome Rob and Jack Blacks irritating one half of the 'Musical Moron Twins'. However its the book that really brings them all to life.
B00000099Y|5.0|This could quite be the definitive album of Rock-N-Roll of our era. It is one of the best albums I havbe ever encountered. Pink Floyd of today is the best way to put it. Superlative!!!! An absolutely perfect album. Unless you like Conway Twitty. An amazing work. It needs to be in you collection if you are in tune to music today. Does for Rock what Hendrix did for guitar. If I could listen to only one album ever again, it would be this one. <br />
B00005LMBK|4.0|Gorillaz' first album 'selftitled' is a blend of pop rock and rap which isn't necessarily a first but they are still original. <br />Most of the songs are really good (why only clint eastwood and 19-2000). Good Lyrics good sound good everything but could be a little better. <br /> <br />NOTE: The intro to M1A1 (Hello, Is Anyone There?) Is actually the intro to the underrated George Romero Classic 'Day Of The Dead'.
0425179877|5.0|This is a well-written account of the space program from the perspective of a mission controller.  The author does a great job of telling the \\"behind the scenes\\" story of each Mercury, Gemini and Apollo mission.  In the end, I was left with a profound feeling of respect for the men and women who worked together using technology that was, by today's standard, ancient to put men on the moon and bring them back safely.  I was also left with a deep feeling of sadness that my children are unlikely ever to experience the awe and pride that we as a country experienced as we watched their achievement unfold.
0385336810|5.0|I loved all of the Becky Bloomwood books so when I found out that Ms. Kinsella had a new book, and a new character I raced out and got the book.  Long story short I couldn't find it here in Bruxelles, so I went and got it from the library and read it in ONE sitting!<br /><br />This was such a fast-paced read and was totally entertaining.  Emma is different from Becky so this was not a carbon copy type story.  In other words it's not like the shopaholic stories.<br /><br />Emma hates to fly and so while waiting for her plane to board she helps herself to a little liquid courage.  The fact that she has just left a business meeting that was less then successful and now has to fret about her job security is not helping.  An airline hostess hears her woes and offers to upgrade Emma to business class.  Emma's life is not going to be the same.  While on the flight the plane hits turbulence.  Combine turbulence with the liquid courage, and one silent, but handsome seat mate and Emma spills all. And I mean ALL!!! She tells all of her secrets thinking that confession is good for the soul if your getting ready to plummet to your death.  Besides he's a stranger.  She'll never see him again!  What does she care that she has spilled the fact that she weighs more then her boyfriend thinks, and that her knickers are the most uncomfortable item of clothing she is currently wearing, because said boyfriend bought them two sizes too small based on the aforementioned weight?<br /><br />Emma couldn't be more wrong.  Monday morning she walks into the office and finds out that her seat mate was actually the owner of the Panther Corp. Now she is faced with Jack Harper and the fact that he knows EVERYTHING!  What's a girl to do?<br /><br />This was a fun read.  Emma and the rest of the cast of characters were great!  Jack is a great hero and this story really had me laughing out loud at the different situations that Emma found herself in.  I'm not generally a fan of chick-lit but Ms. Kinsella an author of this genre that I will automatically pick up!  I highly recommend this latest effort by Ms. Kinsella.  Emma is a character that you will like just as much as you liked Becky! Maybe even a little more. For a fun and easy read you can't go wrong with \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\". Kinsella an author of this genre that I will automatically pick up!  I highly recommend this latest effort by Ms. Kinsella.  Emma is a character that you will like just as much as you liked Becky! Maybe even a little more. For a fun and easy read you can't go wrong with \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\"
B00028HBKM|5.0|I went to this movie reluctlenly after seeing all the hype play out on the news and in the media. I heard both sides of the story. Either it's a Christian propaganda film making the Jews look bad or a wonderful portrayal of the last few hours of Jesus. I heard it was brutal and sadomasochistic and also an accurate description of how the Romans would torture and kill criminals. Regardless of how you may feel going into this film, you can not deny the excellent cinematography, amazing sets and realism this movie portrays. You would have to convince yourself to come out of this movie feeling hatred for the Jews. Nothing shown in the movie made me feel any animosity to anyone including the Jews. The movie pulls you in right away and you actually feel you are their watching Jesus being crucified and I have to admit I did shed a few tears. I could not help it, the movie is that convincing. All this media hype about being overly violent and containing hate towards anyone is flat out ridiculous, and since when does anyone in Hollywood show concern over a violent film especially when they glorify violence, calling it artistic freedom. HYPOCRITES....very pathetic and sad. This movie is probably one of the most realistic movies I have ever seen, filmed brilliantly and was a huge risk for Mel Gibson, remember no one in Hollywood wanted to touch this film until they saw the huge Box office returns. Then they all jumped on the bandwagon. Hollywood = Shallow-wood
B00005JMUA|5.0|A comment crucial to understanding this film is made by David Carradine in the 'making of' documentary included with this DVD: 'Tarantino's movies have never been about the violence or action; they are about the minds and hearts of violent people.'<br /><br />In Volume 2, the focus on character and motivation is stronger than ever, and the Bride's final showdown with Bill - more conversation than combat - is as engaging a scene, emotionally, as the movie's other setpiece, her battle with Elle, is engaging viscerally.<br /><br />But those who say that Volume Two is 'better' than Volume One because of its slower pace and exposition fail to appreciate the entire film. Volume Two is a counterpoint to - and a fulfilment of - ideas created in Voume One.<br /><br />What may be the best evidence of Kill Bill's artistic value is that the Bride's five opponents do not just differ in their strength and combat gimmicks, allowing for more and more elaborate fight scenes; but in their motivations, their attitude toward violence, toward their own happiness and, ultimately, toward their own deaths. Each of them represents a philosophy. Vernita Green is the repentant killer; O-Ren is the megalomaniacal, Caligula-esque nihilist; Budd is a fatalistic, quiet nihilist; Elle is ambitious, cruel and spiteful. Bill is the ultimate philosophy of violence, violence for the sake of violence. The Bride was offered an escape from this world in the form of her child, which she lost, plunging her back into the cycle of death; but of course, as we know at the end of Volume One, her child is still alive.<br /><br />My only complaint is with the DVD, which is fairly sparse on features. Am I the only one who sees a 'special two-disc deluxe edition' coming out in the next few years?
B00014K5TQ|2.0|This movie only proved to me that Macauly Culkin really cannot act. Seth Green blew him away literally. This movie could have been good. It had a very interesting premise (at least to me since I was around during all those crazy Limelight days) but wow Culkin singlehandedly ruined it for me.  <br /> <br />2 stars for subject, set, crazy clubkid costumes and the supporting actors (minus Chloe who also once again played herself--a drugged up moron with no real insight).  <br /> <br />
B00005JNA2|5.0|this is not a sequel to the first movie...  rather, it's a follow-up...  calling it a sequel seems to cheapen it somewhat, it's like spiderman 2 or some dumb-arsed action flick...  ethan hawke and julie delpy are superb, they have such wonderful chemistry together and the dialogues so spontaneous, it almost feels as if they are living in the real world and we are living in a movie...  oh when and when is \\"before sunset\\" coming to dvd?  i NEED it!  and i don't even type in captialized letters for the most part!
B00006WUWQ|4.0|of it's own.  When it started, they just wanted to make a comedey version of James Bond (If you haven't noticed, here's somethings that might spark your memory).  Obviously, they're both Spy's under cover, going on missions, and getting the girl, but here's what you might not have noticed... <br />Bond: The Spy Who Loved Me, Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me <br />Bond: Dr. No, Powers: Dr. Evil <br />Bond: Goldfinger, Powers: Goldmember <br />Bond: Octopussy, Powers: Austinpussy <br />... and those are just a few examples.  I guess my point is, is that some people don't realize it was a rip-off, and despite that, it turned out to be a very funny movie! (btw, I only know so much about Bond because of my little brother, he's a big fan.)
B00005JN2X|3.0|Collateral is a movie directed by Michael Mann (Ali, Heat) and starring Tom Cruise (Rain Man) and Jamie Foxx (Any Given Sunday). Looking at both actors' resumes, I've realized that Tom Cruise hasn't played a role of a villain for as long as one can remember. And Jamie Foxx hasn't been recognized before for being a good actor, not even in a supporting role.  <br /> <br />I understand that Cruise would want to play the role of a merciless cold blooded killer to expand his acting abilities. But honestly, the role of Vincent does not fit Tom Cruise's character. The role would have been great for someone like Brad Pitt or, for an older generation, Al Pacino. Jamie Foxx does not fit in the entire picture, let alone the role of cab driver Max, a role that would have been perfect for somebody like Samuel Jackson. He delivers his lines like somebody reading off of a cue card. The scenes that are meant to be intense, like the scene when Vincent's first victim comes falling out of the window and onto Max's cab, become vague and dull with Foxx's overacting and the loose dialogue.  <br /> <br />Collateral could have been a very good movie if only the director and casting crew would have decided to hire different lead actors. <br /> <br />C-
B0002HTZJI|2.0|I've been a fan of RHCP for a long time, but this is just a really bad album.  <br /> <br />No one can deny that RHCP isn't the worlds greatest live band. Anthony Kiedis is off key almost all the time, he has improved on this record though. John Frusciantes guitar is just annoying and very thin sounding, especially when Flea is playing his thin sounding bass. The album lacks bass, and bottom end. Chad Smith's performance is solid, and Flea does the job, still with his thin sounding bass. <br /> <br />And then there's the setlist! As someone else mentioned, there's only 2 songs from \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\", and none from albums before that. What happened to \\"Me and My Friends\\", \\"Breaking The Girl\\", \\"Suck My Kiss\\", \\"Fire\\", and the master cover of Stevie Wonders \\"Higher Ground\\"? There's way too many songs from \\"By The Way\\", and almost no funk at all. It's a shame. <br /> <br />I looked at the setlist from their 2001 DVD \\"Off The Map\\", and it features a fair mix of songs from their amazing career.
B0002IU988|5.0|I don't buy albums often anymore, and when I heard of Creed's breakup, I was bummed, but being an aging rocker listening to AM sports talk most times, I wasn't overly depressed. However, when I heard \\"Open Your Eyes\\", I thought it was Creed until the vocals and an actual guitar solo, heard the name, found the website, and listened to the cuts: <br /> <br />OH MY GOD! Tremonti with Alter Bridge is destined for my top 5 guitar albums of all time.  He has incredible blending of riffs, power chords overlayed with lightning quick transitions and the solos - I haven't smiled like that listening to solos since \\"Sweet Child\\"!    <br /> <br />Prior personal top 5 guitar albums of all time: <br />(No order) <br /> <br />Van Halen I, Appetite for Destruction, Hemispheres, Rising Force and Blizzard of Oz - It's that good!  I think this may kick Yngwie out.... <br /> <br />I see alot of complaints about Myles, but given that I can't hear him over the incredible MT's shred, It doesn't bother me.  If you have to, tune out Myles and listen to - no kidding - some of the best guitar I have heard in decades.  If you can't tune out Myles, you don't like guitar. <br /> <br />As to Slash in Velvet Underground vs the new Tremonti made earlier, I agree.  I am a huge Slash fan, and thought Tremonti was more melodic than skilled, but I am changed.  Listening to the intro in the title track, sent me to the store to buy this day one - I have NOT been disappointed. <br /> <br />A must own to anyone who plays or enjoys guitar, and if you don't know who Steve Morse is, don't come on with anything about how Tremonti is not one of the new guitar gods....This is some unbelievable stuff!
B00006DEFA|1.0|I don't think this movie is supposed to be regarded as fact, but rather as fiction inspired as fact. <br /> <br />I think this movie is a work of genius, but a lot of people fault this movie for its mispresentation of facts and so forth. (which is why I gave it 1-Star so that you who read 1-star reviews know my sentiments). But that's missing the point of the movie. <br /> <br />It is not \\"based on a true story\\" but is rather (a) a meditation on the genius that is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and (b) the self-destructing power of jealously and self-conceit, which fuels this fictional Salieri. Do not take this movie as fact or try to find facts if you happen to have read up on Mozart in the booklets of your CD collection. <br /> <br />I know a little about Mozart (enough to know that the entire \\"third act\\" concerning his Requiem is almost entirely fictional) but this is not a movie that wants to be a photographed documentary. A lot good, all time classics go far away from what could be called the true facts. <br /> <br />\\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\", \\"Braveheart\\", \\"Shadowlands\\" and \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" to name a few movies that, despite being great in themselves, twist the facts at their leisure. <br /> <br />\\"Amadeus\\" is a good movie and one of the most intelligent. To unjustly deny its greatness due to a few \\"indiscrepencies\\" would be a rather sad event. <br /> <br />5 Stars
B00005JMAH|4.0|I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan. My husband and I took the kids to see this film in the theater and I left horribly disappointed though they all, having never read the books, loved it. It was seriously rushed. The most important part of the book, in my opinion, was not given the attention it needed. The entire telling of Sirius's innocence and Scabber's really being Peter Petigrew lasted all of about 5 minutes when in actuality it was over an hour. Now of course they can't and won't make it take that long it would be ridiculous but they didn't have to rush through one of the most important pieces of the entire plot of the story. There was no explination of Trelawney's prediction or it's relevance. There was no mention of who Messers, Moony Wormtail,Padfoot, and Prongs were. No mention of James being Prongs and the relevance to Harry's patronus beign a stag, which in itself was very downplayed. They completely removed the fact that Ron and Hermione had a huge parting of the ways. The added bits to the time turning section were ridiculous. I can understand wanting to add more of Lupin as a werewolf for dramatic effect but really it could have been done better. \\"Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?\\" This is probably the line that offends me most. They wasted time with trivial things that weren't even in the book instead of putting in actual elements of the story. There was no reason to completely cut out Christmas it was like the whole movie happened in a span of 2 weeks because of this. And in doing so had to put his recieving his firebolt at the end of term. Which of course caused Ron's recieving of Pigwidgeon to be completely removed from they story. Preytell what exactly did he ride through out the rest of the Quidditch season? Since they did show his broom being smashed up are we to assume he rode a school broom which didn't happen? Not to mention they completly cut out Harry meeting Cho scaring the pants off Malfoy and Gryffindor winning the Quidditch Cup. Though Cho will be added in later the moment for Harry's patronus charging down Malfoy is lost. Though the second match is not that missed the last and final match was a rather important victory for Harry. It probably would have only taken an additional 20 minutes of film to show just about all of this since most of it happened around the same time. Quidditch being the exception. This is my favorite of all the books and perhaps I am a little overly critical but it is my opinion.     I did go and watch the movie again and on the second go around I caught things that I had origionally missed. This is definatly a movie that you have to see more than once to really get the whole of the story that they have bothered to tell. This of course is due to the horrible rushedness of the movie. Upon my second and eventual third watching of this film I came to like it much better although the important missing elements and the changed and additional content still do not sit well with me the movie as it is is rather good. Although critical I like the movie and will buy it.     I personally think that the directing of the first two were much better and the feel of the movies were better. Buckbeak was amazing though as was the flying scene and the Quidditch match although I didn't really see the point in making the dementors fly since they didn't. The cold and freezing water were nice touches though brought the feeling alive for the unread audience. Most of my problems with the movie can't be blamed solely on Cuaron though. Most of what I have a problem with are with the screenplay by Steven Kloves. If I had not watched the interviw with Jo speaking about the screenplay I'd never have believed she approved of it. And if i dind't know that he had written the screenplays for the other two movies I would never have thought this work done by the same person. But as long as she's approving then that's all that really matters as it's her work.    The acting was wonderful and I think that Daniel, Emma, Rupert, and Tom are growing very well if their talents and sincerly hope they will continue to take on the rolls throughout. I also sincerly wish that Richard Harris had been able to complete the films as Dumbledore. It's just not the same without him. He was an amazing Dumbledore. Just exactly as I had envisioned him as I read. I am not fond of Micheal Gambon's Dumbledore. Instead of portraying him as an imensely powerful figure who is kind and caring as well as a little mad he portrays him as mostly just mad. Since the screenplay removed most of his \\"fatherly advice\\" and gave it to either Sirius or Lupin he seems to be a person who is just there, a person who not important or powerful.    Although the majority of this review sounds like one giant bash I would like to reiterate that I do like and enjoy this movie. It just took me some time to get over my disappointment. I had been expecting another Chris Columbus film even though I knew the director had been changed. I had expected the film to follow the same feel of the previous two and be as close to text as they had been. It was in this that I was disappointed. Overall it is an excellant movie though it does not tell the story as I would have.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I wonder if George W. Bush understands the irony:  In large part, the rest of the world's antipathy towards us for our unilateral attack of Iraq is what catapulted Fahrenheit 9/11 to this year's Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, thereby adding to the momentum it got upon its US release. <br /> <br />Does Moore show some prejudice in presenting the facts and circumstances surrounding our build up to war against Iraq?  Absolutely.  But you know Moore's bias going in.  Does his movie still deserve the label \\"documentary\\"?  Probably.  Despite the \\"artistic license\\" Moore takes in presenting the facts, the facts are what they are.  Even if you watch this movie with a grain of salt and only believe, say, 50% of what you see, it's still terrible indictment of Bush and his administration. <br /> <br />I remember shortly after 9/11 hearing the story - it was just a vague rumor then - of Bush having sat for a period of time in the classroom where he was reading with an elementary school class even after being told by Andrew Card that \\"America is under attack.\\"  Cynical as I am, I wasn't about to believe that story without proof.  Michael Moore, as sportscaster Warner Wolf would say, \\"goes to the video tape,\\" and there's Bush, sitting in the classroom for fully seven minutes after being told the country was being attacked. <br /> <br />It's interesting to me that although Moore presents documented facts in his movies, the conservative response is always to simply shoot the messenger (i.e. Moore hates America, Moore's a fat, stupid white man).  The lack of any reasoned debate about Moore's work is very telling about the inability of his critics to refute the facts in the movie. <br /> <br />Most touching is the story of the woman who lost her son in Iraq.  She'd been a believer, until she lost her son and found out that we'd gone to Iraq under false pretenses in the first place.  I can't imagine her pain. <br /> <br />Bush ultimately explained the inexplicable seven minutedelay in leaving the classroom by saying that he was \\"collecting his thoughts.\\"  As talk show host Bill Maher has pointed out, that was a helluva time for him to start a new hobby. <br /> <br />See the movie with an open mind and decide for yourself if this man and his cabal should be running the country for the next four years.
6305882592|5.0|I know this film by heart and love the many, many hysterical and memorable scenes--- too many to count.  This film works on all levels and is the perfect cult film.  While both Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are superb, you'll also love the other cast members, especially Vivian Pickles who plays Harold's mother. And the soundtrack is so perfect for this film....as I said, it works all around.  Don't miss it.
B00004S6GL|5.0|There are two types of Elliott Smith songs, Those that are remenicent of his past, which are acoustic and extremely intimate, and those that are well produced to emulate a whole band.  This album mostly contains songs that can be compared to a Beatle pop like quality that is sparsely spread with those infamous acoustic numbers.  I love this album, its exciting to listen to through the arrangements, but most importantly like every other Elliott album you get lost inside his lyrics.  He is one of the most amazing lyricists i have ever run across, his words paint pictures and scenes that we all experience from time to time, this relatability creates a connection to where he can grow and grow and grow on you. <br /> <br />This album is either a hit or a miss, and sometimes if it is a miss it takes a few spins to fully come around and appreciate it's greatness. <br /> <br />The first track starts off with the single, Son of Sam, which it's title was taken from the infamous serial killer back in the day, though smith claimed that the song wasn't about the killer, and more about the evils of man, it still leaves clues to its real meaning.  This song is popy and very fun to listen too his guitar work on this song reflects what the rest of the album is like, superb.   <br /> <br />Another song to take notice of is the song LA.  This song is about the city of LA and how he had to adjust to it once moving there.  The melodies and images he portrays are just stunning as well as his guitar solo. <br /> <br />But there is one song that is worth purchasing the whole album for, and that is, Cant Make a Sound.  This song is perfect in every way.  It starts soft, but strong with Smith and his acoustic guitar, but as the song progresses it gets more and more involved, eventually leading up to a full orchestral ending that will blow your socks off. <br /> <br />treat yourself and get this album, i promise you wont regret it.
B0002IU988|5.0|Just so people can know where I'm coming from, my favorite bands are Metallica, Rage, Tool, Creed, and CCR and I like Korn, Dashboard Confessional, Third Eye Blind, DMB,and Dream Theater as far as i know them.  I like good punk, metal, numetal, classic rock, regular rock, anything with talent and a unique sound. <br /> <br />To move to this band, first of all, I was a fading Creed fan.  I loved \\"My Own Prison\\", \\"Human Clay\\" grew on me very well, but \\"Weathered\\" was a bland, sappy flop in my opinion.  The intensity was gone, and due to bits and pieces here and there i could tell that Mark had great talent and could throw out fast, intense music, but their sappyness was getting to me and I gave up on them. <br /> <br />This band has built so much on what i loved about creed and expanded their musical boundaries.  God are these guys unique.  All i hear on the radio is numetal stuff that can put out a few good songs, but they are so simplistic.  Alter Bridge throws intense, but positive sounding music at you like a freight train.  I love the smile this music puts on my face while i'm slamming my hands on my steering wheel.  it's probably not for everyone, but after hearing enough, korn, godsmack, new metallica, and more repetetive, overly low and simplified \\"mean\\" riffs, this is SO refreshing.  A great mix of melody and intensity. <br /> <br />I guess the best i can compare it to is a mixture of Creed and Dream Theatre (don't get angry yet).  This album reminds me of bits of the song change of seasons (the great higher voice and guitar licks galore).  The singer belts out great vocals for both their heavy and more emotional songs, and that combined with Tremonti on ultra-steroids, this album will give you chills of excitement. <br /> <br />To give you an idea of the songs and how they compare to creed and basically how they sound (the grades i give them are tougher than if I were be comparing this band to other lesser bands): <br /> <br />1: Find The Real; This song leads right into the album with a dissonant, heavy riff that tells you that this ain't creed no more.  This is a song with some anger in it, and i really like it, but for more traditional creed fans(radio creed fans), it might be a little heavy and dissonant. 8/10 <br /> <br />2: One Day Remains; If the first song didn't convince you that Mark is great, or this band for that matter, this one will!  After a brief drum intro, it rips into the fastest consistent guitar Mark's played.  It's constant in your face riffage, but it's the most perfect combination of melody and intensity i've ever heard. Great Song. 10/10 <br /> <br />3: Open Your Eyes;  You've probably heard this on the radio.  It's very Creed-like, but very good still.  The guitar is very well arranged, and it reaches a pinacle at the solo.  Another strong song. 7/10 <br /> <br />4: Burn It Down; This starts out with a quazi-dissonant but very enticing intro, and the vocals come in soft and merky.  It builds slowly, and continues to be a pretty intense song.  This songs vocals really do it for me.  Hard to describe, but this song is great.  The ending solo tops it off well.  8/10 <br /> <br />5: Metalingus; This starts kind of like One Day Remains with drums, and a real heavy but simple riff is the main part of the song, but it's the additions Mark throws in anytime Myles isn't singing that make this song awesome.  Just riffs and licks galore. Really aggressive lyrics and a great chorus are the icing on the cake.  It's so fast and fun, and for all the Metallica fans out there, the end has a very Battery style end.  Just hammering double bass drums and fast low guitar. 9/10 <br /> <br />6: Broken Wings; This is where the album softens up a bit, but god do i love this song, the intro is really interesting. Think Hotel California gone Mark Tremonti.  Then it kicks into its darker tone, till the beautiful chorus.  This song is gonna be considered sappy creed style by some, but the improved guitar, and great vocalspush these otherwise somewhat sappy songs to an intense level.  Creed fans will love this song. 8/10 <br /> <br />7: In Loving Memory; This song starts out with a very intricate little diddy, and it's pretty soft, but it's about Marks mom dying, which ups my respect for this song about 1000%.  It's a subject rarely brought up in music, and i always like that.  It will be compared to With Arms Wide Open, but for some reason it seems a lot more heartfelt and beautiful than WAWO, which was a really annoying song IMO.  A little too Creedy 6/10. <br /> <br />8: Down To My Last; A good song, but after the last 2 being a little too sappy, this gets to be a bit much, but he really has an amazing voice, so it brings the song back a bit. It really has a good song, but i can almost see stapp doing his JC pose. It really has a great solo though, which makes it pretty complete.  7/10 <br /> <br />9: Watch Your Words; And just when you thought this album was going to fade off into sappy songs like \\"Weathered,\\" this metal-ish song comes in.  Not quite as good as the title track or Metalingus, this song is still worth listening to for its great arabian-music riffs mixed with melodic sections.  The vocals fall a bit short though. Still a good heavy song.  7/10 <br /> <br />10: Shed My Skin; When this started I thought it sorta sounded like \\"Lullaby\\" from Weathered, which I really liked.  Then it goes into some distorted melody, and a really great chorus, with fun, moving guitar.  This one has a bit of a Creed sound to it again, but with Marks upped guitar intricacy, it really makes these songs much more enjoyable. 8/10 <br /> <br />11: The End Is Here; This throws some fun arabian licks into an ok song.  Think Carol of the Bells.  Not much to say about it, but it's lacking some of the intensity in some spots, but there is some catchy stuff. The best parts of this song are marks licks. 6/10 <br /> <br />Some people will see some of the same sappiness in some of these songs as some of the creed songs that got flack, but let me tell you, Mark has turned them into dynamic, interesting, heartfelt, fun songs to listen to.  That, plus the harder of the songs are so intense, fun, and fast that you will be wondering what kind of lead weight scott stapp was to these guys. I love it all, definately check it out.
B00005JN2X|4.0|My second Tom Cruise movie.  It was a slow movie.  A few intense moments that you will find yourself cursing underneath your breath, and wanting to help Jamie Fox out of his delimia.  I am not one to watch thrillers because I get a little worked up.  The comic relief was great!  L.A. at night was a perfect setting, peaceful yet decietful. <br /> <br />The movie begins with Jamie Fox preparing for a day at work in his PERFECT tidy cab.  He picks up a few wacky people, and then we meet Foxx's love interest.  Things begin to look up for this underdog cab driver.  Then he gets to accomidate Vincent (Cruise), for the evening.  Vincent offers him $700 dollars fare for the rest of the night, which is all fine and dandy until a dead man falls on his cab, while waiting for Vincents return from one of his stops.  Foxx begins to lose his wits after that, (who can blame him).  Then things begin to get personal, involving a scene with Foxx's Mother in the hospital, and several deaths have been reported throughout the city all night.  The comical relief is classic in this movie, and basically saves it.  The ending is almost shocking, but could use one last dose of comical relief.   If I could only tell you the line I would end it with!! (but I can't!) A good summer flick! ;-)
B000002GFC|3.0|When you listen to Hendrix or the Beatles from this same year, or even a few years before, a couple things stand out. One of them is the shoddy original recording mix of Cream that no remaster seems to be able to fix. There's some kind of distance between you and the music -- a couple inches of sonically muffled noise, and no, I don't mean because their amps were too loud. There is always just a hiss, and the drums always sound like they were off in the distance, with all sorts of crashing and banging into one mike. I can only imagine how good this band might sound if someone had wandered over from the Beatles', Donovan's, Rolling Stones' or anyone else's studio and mentioned, \\"Hey, this guy is a pretty good drummer, why record everything through some cheap garage sound system?\\" Compare the recording quality of, say the White Album to this. Heck, even Zeppelin with its distortion was better recorded. Steppenwolf, too. And, dare I say, \\"Blue Cheer\\"? Too bad. It's not like they couldn't have afforded better recording. They sound way, way behind the times for their time on the recording quality level. <br /> <br />The second thing that ruins Cream is Jack Bruce. His wailing vocals are neither here nor there, and he has some indulgent need to echo the chorus and guitar leads with lots of \\"waah waah!\\" choruses. I guess he was all that back in the day (though how he was \\"the cream\\" with no memorable pre-Cream hits, and just a career abyss thereafter says plenty), but he ruins every Cream song for me. Nowadays everyone thinks Cream is all about Eric Clapton, but it still sounds like they're trying to back some earnest, failing singer. I guess his muffly, willy-nilly basslines are/were the cat's pajamas, but if Eric had sung these songs, brought in a studio bassist and a decent engineer, Cream would have been oh so much better. <br /> <br />Still a rockin' band, I must say.
0446613444|5.0|This book was even tighter in it's execution than Black Echo.  Bosch figures out a series of drug related murders and the puzzle fits nicely.  Connelly jumps expertly from the FBI/Break in caper of the first novel to the DEA/drug murders of the second.  Is Black Ice real?  It certainly seemed to be.  Bosch also continues to grow as character--as do Irving and others.  A superior mystery.
B0001UZZWW|5.0|i purchursed this dvd the other day and it is great the 3-d is alright on the television but much better on the computer.  the 3-d looks just like its in your face sometimes like when the spiders come down and when the fairy comes out.  the movie is great too, the animation is excellant. i would recommened this dvd for everyone.
B00008H2LB|3.0|linkin park exploded onto the rock scene back in 2001 with \\"hybrid theory\\", a joyride through intense lyrics and singing/screaming by singer chester bennington and rhymes, raps and hooks by MC mike shinoda. <br /> <br />with their newest release \\"meteora\\", it's where the first album left off. a strange intro followed into the great introduction track \\"don't stay\\". however, if you were expecting something just a pinch different from these guys, you won't even get that. all the tracks follow the exact same formula as hybrid theory did back in 2001. it's that album all over again. eventually we'll all get bored with their linguistics and music and just forget about them. but i don't want that to happen because linkin park is such a talented group with lots of ambition. <br /> <br />\\"somewhere i belong\\" is rightfully the first single off the album, which is a typical linkin park song. the album takes somewhat of a road that leads them down to redundancy. the subject matter either consists of hating someone for what he/she did to you or hating yourself. not very uplifting now is it? \\"hit the floor\\" is a direct attack on this 'you' character that says you're on top of the world but will fall because of your lies. maybe chester is attacking someone that dumped him or attacked him or maybe he just hates his fans. <br /> <br />the album gets into an instrumental fiasco with \\"session\\", which is cool to listen to. afterwards, it cuts into the finale called \\"numb\\", the third single. the album is only around 40 minutes, but that's plenty of time to destroy everything around you and hate yourself in the same sitting. <br /> <br />the same as their 2001 release, short lived but a nice piece of music to have.
B0002KPHXS|4.0|The film that introduced Ingrid Bergman to American audiences is a beautiful re-make of the Swedish version (also starring Ingrid). Some viewers might find it too \\"over the top\\" dramatically in some places and dated in style but if you can put this aside - it's a real tearjerker. Leslie Howard (who I always found a bit 'weak' as an actor - or maybe it was the characters he played!) fits this role like a glove as the famous husband who falls hopelessly in love with his daughters piano teacher (played by Ingrid). I've seen the film countless times and it still moves me especially in the closing stages. It's very similar in theme to \\"Brief Encounter\\", so if you liked that, you should definitely give this a look especially as it's only relatively short (just a bit over 60 minutes).
B000002KET|4.0|Sabbath Bloody Sabbath finds Black Sabbath continuing to expand their musical horizons which they began doing on their previous release Volume 4. However, where on that album the more experimental tracks were among the strongest songs on the album, it's their trademark heavy riffs which carry this album. This would also be the last strong album the band would record with Ozzy Osbourne as their albums after this contained less memorable songs with each release even as they expanded their sound.<br /><br />The most well known and best song here is the title track, which is not only one of the heaviest songs they've ever recorded but also one of their most influential. \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" was played in dropped D tuning which not only gave the song a gloomier sound but would also be used by many bands several years later when new genres such as grunge and death metal started using this tuning almost exclusively. The tracks \\"A National Acrobat\\" and \\"Killing Yourself To Live\\" are outstanding, each starting out as your typical riff heavy Sabbath songs before gaining momentum and becoming killer jams before ending abruptly. \\"A National Acrobat\\" has more great riffs than many bands write over a single album. Other strong tracks include \\"Looking For Today\\" and \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\", which was later covered by Metallica on their Garage Inc. album. The remaining tracks see the band continuing to expand their sound for better or worse. While \\"Fluff\\" is a decent instrumental, its placement between \\"A National Acrobat\\" and \\"Sabbra Cadabra\\" breaks the album's momentum. \\"Spiral Architect\\" is a decent track which contains strings at the song's conclusion which don't gel with the music. \\"Who Are You\\" is a very lethargic track dominated by  synthesizers, an experiment that clearly doesn't work. The heavy tracks here are all great though and that makes this an essential purchase for the Sabbath/Ozzy Osbourne fan and worth checking out for the more casual fan.

B0000CFW87|5.0|As a person who doesn't normally listen to the \\"opera\\" type of music, this CD absolutely blew me away. It is by far my favorite CD right now. I listen to it everyday.

B000066NW0|1.0|Avril Lavigne does not sing punk music, OK? Just because some 20 year old guys who are payed minimum wage to play punk-like music on their guitars and their drums next to Avril does not make Avril, or her pathetic music, Punk-material. <br />Sk8r Boi? was the 'a' and 'e' keys broken on her computer when she wrote the lyrics, or is the use of the '8' and the 'i' in boy just a cheap way for rich, money-making businessmen who just want to appeal to younger, more naive teens/pre-teens? <br /> <br />REAL punk music is displayed with bands like the Sex Pistols. <br />Punk wannabe pop music is displayed primarily with Avril, and to a far less poor extent, Good Charlotte. <br /> <br />And to the people who have found out that Avril will soon become a country singer/was a country singer; Country cannot fuse with punk. A moron could've figured that out. Music is like a painting and its frame- an abstract picture doesn't blend with another type of frame- at some point it MUST fit. Think about that. <br /> <br />Also, to the slow-minded Avril fanboys who haven't heard real music, I really do not care if you click 'no' under where it says 'was this helpful to you?', because quite frankly, I've argued with fanboys like you who like Britney clones just as much as you, and they come out of the argument sounding like it's the only music that they've heard.  <br /> <br />Oh and by the way- MTV plays all of the cheapest, newest music that appeals to the younger generation, despite lack of actual talent. Now, how many times did you see Sk8r Boi and Complicated being shown daily on MTV?
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Probably the greatest anti-war documentary ever made  ever made, and a testament to the power of narrative!  The genuis is in the presentation: an 80 year old   talking head answering questions from the off-screen  director. Simply brilliant....
B0000C0FJB|4.0|In 2003, the legendary Progressive Rock band Rush released a 3 Disc Set on CD and a 2 Disc Set on DVD covering their 2002 concert in Rio de Janeiro. This review will chronicle the CD release. The background for this concert was that this was the concert recorded on the final night of the \\"Vapor Trails\\" tour. Rush had been on about a 5 year hiatus following the tragic death's of drummer Neil Peart's wife and daughter. The album \\"Vapor Trails\\" marked a reunion for the Canadian rock trio following what would be their longest hiatus as a band. This was the first time Rush had ever played Rio. <br /> <br />The serious Rush fan will probably want to get both the 3 Disc CD Set and the 2 Disc DVD set. The Rio Concert that is on the first DVD is contained on the CD set in its entirety, There are two differences between the CD and DVD: 1) On the DVD set, in addition to the actual Rio concert there is a documentary about the Brazilian shows and Rush called \\"The Boys in Brazil\\".  There are also multi angle views of three of the concerts instrumentals as well as some hidden \\"Easter Eggs\\"; 2) The CD Set contains two \\"Bootleg\\" songs that you won't get on this DVD set - \\"Betweeen the Sun & Moon\\" and \\"Vital Signs\\".  <br /> <br />When you have 28 years of material to perform as well as promoting a new album, it can be very difficult to pick what songs to select.   Rush does a pretty good job at covering their material.   I personally view Rush has having three distinct eras.  Some Rush fans may disagree, but this is how I categorize the music: 1) The Epic Works Era (1974-1980: \\"Rush to \\"Hemispheres\\") - this is a focus on longer more epic songs with a SciFi and Fantasy Influence;  2) The Synth Era (1980-1989: \\"Permanent Waves\\" to \\"Presto\\") -  Rush moves to shorter songs covering a wide range of topics  from History, Sociology, Psychology, and even touches of SciFi and of course Rush makes use of technology and synthesizers to get the sound; 3) The 'Modern' Era (1990 - Present: \\"Roll the Bones\\" through \\"Vapor Trails\\") - Rush moves away from Synthesizers and now incorporates a more hard rock sound.   The Rush in Rio collection covers 29 songs (27 from Rio and two bonus tracks from other shows).  There are 6 songs from the Epic Works Era, 13 songs from the Synth Era, and 10 songs (including 4 from \\"Vapor Trails\\") from the Modern Era - some might argue what songs were picked from what era ( I would have liked to see some other songs from \\"Power Windows\\" , \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" and \\"Hold You Fire\\"), but they did spread the table pretty well. <br /> <br />The big complaint many make about the CD abd DVD sets is the sound quality.  If you read the liner notes, you might think the bad weather caused the bad sound.   This may be true to some extent, but I personally think this recording has an element of realism.   Without watching the performance, you can almost hear how Rush will connect with crowd and do it well.    If there is any argument with the complaint on the sound quality - it could be directed at the first two tracks \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Distant Early Warning\\", but these aren't that bad.  After these songs, the quality picks up and you will truly hear the realistic element I mention. <br /> <br />The nice thing about this concert is that it is presented in its entirety.  The CD recording flows just like the DVD recording that flows as close as anything short of being at the concert.   The first disc contains the 1st half of the concert before the intermission.  The second half following the intermission starts on disc two and finishes on disc three.  The extra \\"bootleg\\" tracks are on disc 3.   While Rush performs many favorite songs (\\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"The Big Money\\", \\"Closer to the Heart\\", \\"Red Sector A\\", \\"2112\\", \\"Limelight\\", and many more) - it is some of the lesser known or older songs that fans might not have heard (recently) in concert that really stand out.  In particular, listen to songs such as \\"The Pass\\" ,\\"YYZ\\", \\"Natural Science\\", and \\"Dreamline\\" and you will see what I mean. <br /> <br />The band gets to showcase with the individual talents.  Neil Peart does an incredible drum solo that pays tribute to the history of percussion called \\"O Baterista\\".   Alex Lifeson and Geddy Lee do a \\"Rush Unplugged\\" acoustic number of \\"Resist\\".   Rush also performs an older song \\"La Villa Stangiato\\" that features Alex Lifeson 'rambling' and showing his sense of humor. <br /> <br />The big drawback of this set is the packaging.  The three disc set was not packaged in a jewel case, but using a cardboard box.   The box for such a \\"special collection\\" opens up and can start to wear and tear rather quickly.  It also is a bit difficult to pull the CDs out of the package, thus the risk for scratching can get higher.  They did this to keep the price down, but I think its a real negative.  Of the CDs, two are close shades grey and one is red.  I think it would have been easier to pick another color besides a shade of gray to make it easier to identify. <br /> <br />The terrific liner notes included in the set called \\"Flying Down to Rio - Leaving Vapor Trails Behind\\". This was written by drummer Neil Peart (a great writer) was originally included in the DVD set, but are also included in the CD set with a preamble on why they also made the CD set. One final note, listening to this CD will give you as good a feel for the concert as the DVD set.   All in all, this is a solid release by Rush and it should keep the fans happy.
B0000CFW87|1.0|Only in this bland and primitive age could anybody have the gumption to mention opera and Josh Groban in the same breath. This syrupy Italo-pop is truly insufferable. I suppose it's great for people who want to seem classy and cultured without having any idea what they're talking about. People who think Andrew Lloyd Webber composes operas. Sarah Brightman fans. Celine Dion fans. Andrea Bocelli fans. Ignorance really must be bliss. Note : Just because it's (terrible) Italian does not make it opera. <br />see : Verdi, Giuseppe. Puccini, Giacomo. Rossini, Gioacchino. <br /> <br />P.S. It's safe to guess that only women listen to this nightmare.
0553278398|4.0|I liked this book, a genuine like. Most hard-core Sci-Fi-ers would probably be disappointed though. Most of the storyline takes place via the three main characters' dialogue, which means there is not a lot of descriptive rambling, nor is there detailed technical workings.  This is the first Asimov book I have read; from it it is clear that Aismov's a philosopher/scientist.<br /><br />The entire book deals with the main character's theory of \\"Psychohistory,\\" which is something akin to a probability/prediction via historical generalizations. As the main character (Hari Seldon - a mathematician) wrestles with developing his theory, the book explores societal issues. The questions that are presented are relevant to learning and education, historical analysis, social & political manipulation, and the aims and purpose of scientific inquiry. However, please do not think that this is a dense book overwrought with esoteric philosophical musing. It is still a quick read. Along with \\"Sophie's World,\\" this would make a great text for Philosophy in Literature courses. The text is really quite tame, PG-rated, if even that, so it would be fine for anyone high-school age and up!<br /><br />Some problems: the characters adapt too quickly and comfortably with new things they are confronted with (particularly words and languages). Hari Seldon, while present constantly, is still a vague and undeveloped character who says some pretty \\"duh\\" things. I think this is because Asimov creates Hari via dialogue and not description. When you finish the book, you don't feel any sort of connection whatsoever with Hari or the other characters.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the last 50 pages have a couple interesting \\"twists,\\" which surprised me. But then, I like being surprised in books - and am open to the possibility. In general, I don't like figuring out the mystery before the main characters do.
6305127646|5.0|This is one of the best movies I enjoy watching time after time. Saw the edited version on TV probably twice and I just had to finally get the DVD. Val Kilmer and Elisabeth Shue definitely have great chemistry and this movie has about a bit of everything from drama to suspense to comedy. It is not to be missed.  <br /> <br />While most of the reviews for this movie are high 4-5 stars, I can't seem to understand why some critics flat out give it 1-2 stars. What a shame... All I have to say is you can't believe everything you read - even this review :)- you have to watch it to know if you like it. <br />
6305127638|2.0|In an attempt to replicate the action-oriented second <br />original cast Star Trek film 'First Contact' is alot of flashy <br />action with little plot.But unlike the high quality 'The Wrath <br />Of Khan' this movie dumbs down the whole idea of Star Trek to such a degree that it comes off as a total vulgar parody!The  <br />dialog is wraught with annoying catch phrases,pointless violence <br />with the usually solid Patrick Stewart acting TOTALLY out of <br />character.The plot about the Borg trying to stop Earth's first <br />faster then light space flight is the only interesting aspect of <br />this film.But it's so poorly written and has such idiodic <br />dialog that no one will care very much! <br />          When I first saw this movie in the theatre is was (as <br />I still am) a STONE Trekker,not a fanatic but a vigilant viewer. <br />But I love it for interesting spaceships,great characters and <br />great social commentary.After I left I found the movie to be so <br />awful that I considered boycotting my favorite sci-fi series! <br />This film will probably please fans of big,dumb action flicks <br />and WWE wrestling but for pure intelligent content this movie <br />is a total wash out.Not worth the time even for the serious fan.

B00000ILBK|5.0|HOLD THE PHONE!!'Star Trek-Insurrection' is a VASTE improvment over the insipidly awful 'First Contact'.It just <br />happened to be made when filmgoers couldn't have cared less <br />about Star Trek.Plot goes-some galactic thugs have located the <br />fountain of youth in the wrings of a planet populated by the <br />Baku,a race of Amish-like people who choose to live without <br />advanced technology.But the thugs,called the S'ona have to remove the Baku from the planet to get what they want.Even so the Federation agree's to help these thugs to it's advantage until Captain Picard and his crew are forced violate Starfleet regulations to have the Baku from destruction. <br />               The movie has love scenes,alot of action and some <br />great special affects but thankfully relies on heavy social <br />commentary about bitterness and forced relocation-a quality <br />the last movie completely skimmed over.And it's lacking in the <br />obnoxiously silly catch phrases from it either!So for a good <br />intruduction to the Next Generation of Trek films I'd be inclined towards this! <br />
B0002I831S|5.0|i am so glad this is going to be available on 3 complete dvd sets. as a child i did not watch sesame street. i watched star trek and understood it. i am now 37 years old and never get tired of the episodes. i cant wait to receive the complete series.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Three reasons to not see the movie are 1)Jake Gyllenhall, <br />2)Sella Ward, and 3) Randy Quaid. Im not sure I spelled their names correctly- but do I care? Absolutely NOT.  All 3 actors are horrible. Theyve got as much depth as actors, as President Bush actually doing a good job running our country. As for the movie itself? The story is as bad as the actors. The only positive thing I can say about the movie are the special effects.  They're great! Very realistic. So if theres any reason to watch this movie, watch it for the special effects. But if your expecting good actors and a good story, you'll surely be disappointed.
B00005NTJM|5.0|Some debut albums obviously suggest what's going to come from a band, while others don't (this doesn't make them any better or worse than the other). Pink Floyd's debut \\"The Piper At the Gates of Dawn\\" contained little if nothing at all that suggested this was the band that would later record the scathing \\"Animals\\" and \\"The Wall.\\" The Who's first album \\"My Generation\\" was full of cheeky insolence but it certainly didn't give a preview to such great works as \\"Quadrophenia.\\" Then again, other debuts make their mark and reveal exactly what a band or artist will sound like at their peak; Led Zeppelin's self-titled debut had enough heavy metal crunch to affirm that they would become the ultimate arena vikings of the 70s; Bruce Springsteen's \\"Greetings From Asbury Park N.J.\\" was an obvious pointer at the anthems-for-the-downtrodden-blue-collar-class that made him famous.<br /><br />And then there's Jethro Tull's auspicious first round \\"This Was.\\" At the time, there had rarely been such gutsy performances from a group making their debut, even in the progressive rock scene. Prog pioneers King Crimson's \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" was still a short while away, and \\"This Was\\" was a landmark recording that gave definite clues as to the uncharted territories that the progressive movements would take listeners to, despite the fact that Tull was obviously heavy into blues roots. But the interpretations of blues and jazz influences here are brave and often challenging, with such standout cuts as `Serenade to a Cuckoo,' `Someday the Sun Won't Shine For You,' and the bizarre, unintelligible `A Song For Jeffrey.' Ian Anderson was asserting himself as an intriguing frontman, and the contributions of the line-up of Mick Abrahams, Clive Bunker, and Glenn Cornick defined this particular era of Jethro Tull, even if they weren't as worldly successful as the next line-ups.<br /><br />\\"This Was\\" is a fascinating debut album, full of promise and originality from a band dabbling heavily in blues and jazz roots while giving the music a brand new sound at the same time.and jazz roots while giving the music a brand new sound at the same time.    <br />
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This film is going to blow your mind to all directions.  Complete different stories were connected by this guy's mind.    It is a must-see in 2004.  You won't regret to spend your $$$ to own this DVD or just rent it.  Try the rent it and own it program and I am sure you will be happy.    This is the firm I had watched 6+ times, and  every time learn something different  -- the third next to \\"Forrest Gump\\" and \\"American Beauty\\".
B0001Z363W|5.0|Ok, a couple of real jackasses have reviewed this album and given it bad reviews simply on the basis of it not being their style. This is a fairly mellow album, but mellow for Zakk isn't the same as mellow for say Sting. So if say Led Zepplin makes your ears hurt, then put this back on the shelf and save your money. On the other hand, if heaviness is your only criterea, then this is not the album for you either. Frankly, I would have prefered more balls out metal album like Blessed Hellride or Stronger Than Death, but Zakk's got more than one kind of music in him and this is a little metal, a little hard rock, and a little country flavor, some accoustic, some piano, its kind of ecclectic. The one thing that stood out the most to me is that Zakk has taken the soloing up yet another notch, there's more speed, more variety, more all around creativity. In some tracks the riffing seems a little uninspired, in others his usual intuitive ability to make simple but really cool riffs shines through. In some places I also do think he's taking the wannabe Ozzy vox a little too far (especially on Houe of Doom). Its not all what I would have asked for, but its really very good from start to finish, very enjoyable and I've got to respect his talent on this album yet again. There is also a remarkable lack of filler for a guy who's so damn prolific. Considering the fact he has released a new studio album EACH of the previous 2 years, I think he did a hell of a job on each of the fifteen tracks here. Lastly, whatever you do, don't listen to that guy who says this is all a mess and complains Zakk only uses penatonic scales, and that its a bunch of macho crap. That last comment especially makes me think he didn't even actually listen to this album, and just doesn't like Zakk on the basis of his being a guy with great chops who isn't a guitar nerd like Malmsteen.
B00003CX97|5.0|This film is a real tour de force dilema . I have always considered this work as a true example of the leadership vision . In a corner we see the single minded leadership of the Colonel (Alec Guiness) who considers a honor concern to build the bridge demanded for the Japanese authority in the camp.<br /><br />But there are other wills who see in this fact the possibility to escape and this commitment will be carried to the last consequences .<br /><br />It is useless to comment it this war jewel , the timeless battle between the epic and the loyalty ; the will against the destiny ; the duty against the freedom .<br /><br />This movie is now part of the cinema story and it is a wonderful example about the leadership means .<br /><br />All the awards this film received were deservedly won .<br /><br />One of the supreme masterpieces of David Lean ; by far, the best brittish director of the XX century.

B000001GQD|5.0|The Tchaikovsky piano concerto was approached for Richter as a imperial concert and not as a simple introspective and romantic work .<br /><br />This idea is extremely remarkable since you muts notice the fact the three first symphonies are deeply imperials , epic and surrounded for the epic majesty and russian pride .<br /><br />But since the four till the sixth , the conception changes completely . We see the man and his inner sorrows and his fears.<br /><br />In this sense the most of the western pianist play Tchaikovsky , as the wounded man tired due his personal tragedy .<br /><br />Richter turns around the clock and reveals Tchaikovsky with the same spirit that we know in his first Symphny , radian and filled with vitality and fierce.<br /><br />The slow tempo does not mean a rendition but a clever statement about a transition between the youth and the mature age . Karajan in this sense did not make any special contributtion in this case . He respected Richter and knew about his special rapport for Tchaikovsky . I mean you will feel the required histamina in the last bars but as a natural consequence of the musical language and not a simple firework exercise.<br /><br />In the case of Rachmaninov , Richter keeps the romantic mood , and he avoids the excesive self indulgence so typical of Rachmaninov .<br /><br />The emphasis turns around another levels , such as the epic nosthalgy for the land he will never see again and obviosuly the hidden homagge to his beloved friend the hypnotist doctor Dahl who rescued him from the alcohol hell .<br /><br />Rowicki was one of the best polish conductors in any age . He understood perfectly this rapture feeling and the key was simply overwhelming .<br /><br />Fundamental issue in your personal collection.

0767827694|4.0|This movie is certainly worth watching. You are taken on a trot through about 400 years of British history from the perspective of the title character who is commanded not to age by Elizabeth I so doesn't. Orlando suffers somewhat as a man and inexplicably changes sex part way through film and has to deal with the unfairness of a patriarchally based system, and always has to deal with the issue of his/her longevity.<br /><br />Quirky and fun, I thought the acting was good, and the cinematography very good. A movie you will talk about after you watch it.
B00003CXGG|2.0|A JAILED CHINESE COP [JET LI] ESCAPES FROM PRISON TO COME TO OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA TO SEEK HIS BROTHER'S KILLER. NOT LONG AFTER HE GETS THERE, HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL [PLAYED BY THE LATE AALIYAH] WHOSE FATHER [DELROY LINDO] HAPPENS TO BE THE LEADER OF A RIVAL SYNDICATE. HAS SOME GOOD MARTIAL ARTS SCENES, BUT OTHER THAN THAT, A MEDIOCRE MOVIE WITH A BAD PLOT. AS I'VE SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE, I'M NOT REALLY A FAN OF JET LI, AND THE ONLY REASON I EVEN TAKE A LOOK AT HIS FILMS IS BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO LOVE MARTIAL ARTS MOVIES. IF YOU DO LIKE JET LI, I ADVISE YOU TO SKIP THIS MOVIE AND SEE THE FIST OF LEGEND, WHICH IS HIS BEST MOVIE.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is excellent. It combines an interesting idea that is enhanced by the cinematographic execution of the narrative. It is a murder mystery with a twist. The movie is played in reverse chronological order with the occasional flash-back (which is a flash-forward in the movie time line) that gives you the perpsective of the hero (Leonard). He suffered a brain injury during a crime and remembers everything before the crime, but after it has no long term memory. He can only recall things that happened within minute or so. This means he has to make notes to give himeself cues and clues as to his current history as he tries to discover who murdered his wife.<br /><br />This is a movie you are going to want watch more than once.

B000068IEU|3.0|If you haven't seen this, don't be fooled by all the hype. It's just not that shocking. Maybe it was in 72, or is if you still live in the 60's, or maybe I'm just desensitised, but it's shock value is totally overrated. It's noteworthy because it's craven's first, and all the uproar surrounding it, but as a fan of true horror I would feel guilty recommending this to anybody looking for a real shocker or a sleaze fick, this is neither. Despite the hype, craven is still a pretty timid director. People compare House on the edge of the Park to this one, saying that was just a ripoff, blah blah...what happened was craven had a good idea but didn't have the stomach to bring it off properly so Deodata tried to correct the situation. Deodata's flick is definitely sleazier, but hey, it's a sleazy subject. Don't make or watch movies that deal with sleaze if you're not willing to include the actual sleaze. In craven's defense, though, he had to deal with the MPAA, so he probably did go as far as he could given the mindset of the time. A quick comparision of the horror elements and then I'm done.  <br /> <br />Both flicks use fear of victimization as the chief emotion to play on, and good horror ultimately leaves \\"decent\\" viewers condoning some inhuman act, thus seeing the villian inside themselves. Both flicks succeed in different ways. Deodata's victimization is more intense and more pervasive, so he definitely succeeds at horrifying the women more than craven does (not that he fails) Deodata, on the other hand, makes the violence and sadism much more arousing, so the decent men come away horrified that it actually turned them on. Craven's victims (the girls) are true victims, since they just get tricked and kidnapped, so that's scarier, but deodata's victims are cruel persons themselves so it becomes a little more difficult to pity them (playing once again on the viewer's inner villian) since they just got beaten at their own game. The turning of the tables, for craven, whenthe parents go to ridiculous extremes of premeditated vengeance, is theoretically more horrifying because you still condone it, but it comes off as comical in the execution, although the peckerwrecker scene is a gem. In Deodata's comeuppance, the former victims are still fighting for survival so their actions are a little more credible and much more easily condoned (a slightly longer leash for the inner villian). Deodata's victims actually provoked their tormentor(at the party anyway, not the poor girl in the car), which plays to most people's inner resentments at having been victimized (psychologically) themselves by an incrowd at one time or another. Deodata gives viewers (at least the males) more freedom to indentify with victims and victimizers alike, while hating them all at the same time, so he stirs up more conflicting emotions than craven, who obviously takes sides with his treatment of it. The scene where Mari is crying as she submits in the woods was very well done and a little more socially responsible than anything Deodata gave us - all his girls did was scream and for some reason tears are just more disturbing - even though she was naked there was nothing sexy about it, which gave me a chance to feel like a goodguy, weakening the horror for me but perhaps intensifying it for female viewers. Craven's one stab at making viewer sympathize with the villians was extremely well done as art - Having just finished raping Mari, Kruger stood there appearing disgusted with himself as she vomited with an emotional singer whining about feeling like nobody wants him. That was the only show of humanity for kruger in the whole movie and the contrast was really powerful. Even Still, rent this one. House on the edge of the park is worth buying, but if can't stomach this one run screaming from park. If you haven't seen either, see this one first to avoid the anticlimax I had when I finally saw this one.

B000002JPA|2.0|I consider myself to be possibly the only person in the entire world who has a thorough mix of prog-rock, death metal, and jam bands in my extensive album collection.  I also always felt like I was late in getting on the Dream Theater Train (of thought?). I listen to everything prog from Yes to Transatlantic, Gentle Giant to Fates Warning, so it should've been a given that I listen to Dream Theater. Nevertheless, until recently I had never heard Dream Theater's \\"Images and Words\\" and only happened to have access because MY MOM owns a copy.<br /><br />As for the album itself, I don't think its the worst thing I've ever heard, I just think it stands on the fence between dramatic and full-on cheesiness.  Of course I expected tons of musical self indulgence amongst the Theater, but I expected to find slightly more variety from such a highly praised band. Possibly the most dissapointing aspect of this album is James LaBrie's unbearingly crooner vocals.  I'm sorry hardcore Theather fans, but Mr. Labrie reminds me a little too much of Michael Bolton at times for me to enjoy.<br /><br />As for the songs themselves, I will say that \\"Images and Words\\" is splintered between a terrible first half and a satisfactory second.  \\"Pull Me Under\\" begins with a nice build up, with fantastic drumming from percussion master Portnoy, but alas the vocals ruin it for me.  \\"Another Day\\", though the 2nd song, is a definate LOW point for this album, as the lyrics and vocals sound as though they should be on an AM-Radio adult contemporary station.  Labrie sounds like he is singing to his daughter, and the saxophone and easy jazz section makes me feel like I'm in a dentist's office.  The next two songs didn't reach out and grab me at all.  \\"Metropolis\\" is an awesome song, and I can see why the decided to expand on that idea.  The dueling keyboard and guitar at the end are a great slab of progressive jamming, and all in all this is the best part of the album.  \\"Under A Glass Moon\\" is cool, although it seems to encompass the same ideas as 'Metropolis'.  All this goodness is sadly forgotten when listening to \\"Learning to Live\\" a song which doesn't stray much from the previous two tracks in terms of musicianship, but the lyrical content and overall cheesiness of the vocals kills it for me. On top of that, \\"Learning to Live\\" goes on way to long and it starts to sound like they should've just turned \\"Metropolis\\" into a 30 Minute song that took up the entire second half of the album.<br /><br />Overall, I can say I've heard a lot worse music than this. The keyboarding of Keving Moore, drumming of Portnoy, and Petrucci's guitar are cool, but I just can't stomach Labrie's vocals.  My biggest conflict when listening to this album is that I it was so highly regarded as a \\"masterpeice\\", and didn't turn out so in the end.  My advice to the hardcore fans of Dream Theater is pick up a copy of Yes's \\"Close to the Edge\\".to encompass the same ideas as 'Metropolis'.  All this goodness is sadly forgotten when listening to \\"Learning to Live\\" a song which doesn't stray much from the previous two tracks in terms of musicianship, but the lyrical content and overall cheesiness of the vocals kills it for me. On top of that, \\"Learning to Live\\" goes on way to long and it starts to sound like they should've just turned \\"Metropolis\\" into a 30 Minute song that took up the entire second half of the album.

B00007AJF9|5.0|Everytime I come upon this movie I fall prey and end up sitting right through to the end. One would imagine it'd jade a bit the fifth time one watched it, but nope.<br /><br />First thing that hooks me up is the fascinating lighting and the camera angles that perfectly complement it. Darkly lit shots of glorious British castles. Impulsive burst of royal dances. Mesmerizing.<br /><br />Next, the grand costumes. Not just grand in fact but gorgeously color coordinated. I suspect they use shots from this film in fashion design courses.<br /><br />Then, the undercurrent of a seductive romance between Blanchett and Fiennes practically sizzles the screen. Much is unsaid, a lot undone. The delight of unrequited infatuations!<br /><br />As though all that's not enough, the film packs a full punch of conspiracies, intrigue, wars without battles, trust, betrayal, religious tirades.<br /><br />Critics lament that it doesn't do justice to history. Well, historical context is seldom a breeze so if you read too much into Elizabeth's rocky childhood (Henry the 8th, her father, was emotionally/sexually quite a convoluted man) then the film seems sparse on intricate detail and its possible effects on the young queen's psyche. Of course.<br /><br />If on the other hand you are willing to forgive the director's decision to refrain from condensing 20 chequered adoloscent years into a 2 hour narrative, and focusing instead on the period of her thorny ascent to the biggest throne of the world in her time, a time when she also fell in love, then this nearly flawless production is a DVD that deserves a proud seat in your collection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The Firefly DVD extra features include a wonderful montage of actor and crew interviews about how it felt to be involved in this project.  This montage is a documentary in itself, about a heroic group of artists struggling with their hope and grief in the face of heartless decisions by evil television executives.<br /><br />But the extra features also give tidbits of information which just make the show that much more enjoyable.  For example:  the camera work was intentionally jerky in places because the aim was to reproduce the cinematic values of the old tv westerns rather than the slick, overproduced space shows we've seen of late.  Joss Whedon's aim was to give it a Western feel--and it works.<br /><br />It works because of the characters.  Though the episodes are occasionally reminiscent of Star Trek (juiced up with that cast-iron Whedon humor), the cast of nine work to make this truly an ensemble production.  And this is not your typical roundup of characters.<br /><br />There is the manly captain, the ass-kicking female warrior, the Xander-like tongue-in-cheek pilot, the suspiciously sophisticated missionary, the handsome fugitive doctor, the rough-and-ready ship's man, the wise harlot, and the mesmerizingly cheerful engineer.  Perhaps the most captivating is River, a teenaged girl who exhibits symptoms of schizophrenia after her super-genius brain has been experimented on by the government.  To what purpose remains unclear, since the show was cancelled.<br /><br />The show may not have been cancelled, but the story lives on in Whedon's _Serenity_, a movie slated to come out in the summer of 2005.  All of the original cast members have been hired for the film, so this single aborted season of Firefly becomes essential viewing for those intending to see the movie.  And I, for one, can't wait.
038533558X|4.0|This is my first Harlan Coben book. WOW, it packs quite a punch. The action is never ending and the plots twists constantly so you never really make up your mind. Ghost was a character I will NEVER forget.  Early in the book, man's inhumanity to woman is upsetting and you dont know where to look.  I had to put it down several times to catch my breath. What a story! What a writer!.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Yes, this is a movie that follows uneven paths at times and yes, Ashton Kucher is no Robert DeNiro (of course after Rocky & Bullwinkle, who would want to be?!?!), but you have to make a choice when viewing this movie as to whether you will allow yourself to take in the story or don't bother and go rent your favorite Vin Diesel movie (Yikes!).  You cannot be shortsighted and one dimensional in your viewing of this film because the best part of it is the underlying question of \\"what if I was never supposed to be born?\\"  Best advice I can give is to watch the Director's Cut.  The theatrical version was toned down to appeal to all the Tipper Gores out there, but you need the hard imagery and dangerous areas to appreciate the depth of the question.  The ending in the Director's Cut almost brought me to tears as images of my own daughter (who is the treasure of my life) ran through my head and how the choices I've made in life led to her being brought into this world.  If you want to like this movie, you defintely will.
B00004T1NA|5.0|Both Lightbulb Sun and Stupid Dream are going to be remastered and re-released in 2005. PT assures that \\"at least one of them, if not both, will receive a DVD-Audio 5.1 surround mix format in addition to the normal remastered CD edition\\".<br /><br />This is a fantasatic CD. Not quite as good as Stupid Dream or In Absentia but a definite must have. So just wait a while until they are re-released instead of spending ridiculous amounts for this CD.
B00005YW4H|3.0|it took me a while to grow accustomed to jone's lilting slightly scratchy voice, but i now consider this cd a must have for relaxing on rainy afternoons. <br /> <br />her voice is very unique and that distinction makes her music (along with the combination of classic and modern repertiore) truly memorable. <br /> <br />although i enjoy the calming effect of this album, i must admit that perhaps that soothing effect stems partly from the fact that jones makes every song sound almost exactly the same.  the monotony is sublime, but i wouldn't buy another album sung by her simply b/c i don't think it would sound any different from this one.
B000148KK2|5.0|WOW... reading some of the reviews for this album here, you'd think Diana Krall has pulled a Miles Davis and started playing with musicians, instruments and rhythms that are completely outside of her regular niche.  No, she has not gone \\"pop\\" at all.  Do you see The Matrix credited as the album's producer?  Do you hear synthesizers anywhere?  Does she have any guest rappers or DJs augmenting her band?  No?  OK, we're getting somewhere.    So, where does this album place among her previous releases?  Well, let's put it this way: if \\"The Look of Love\\" put you to sleep with its insistent sameness -- same tempos, same rhythms, no shifts in dynamics -- then this album will sound a lot to you like her second album, \\"Only Trust Your Heart.\\"  Just like on that album, Diana is backed by a sturdy drummer (unlike her more popular trio recordings).  She also has a bassist and guitarist in her band (no sax this time around, though it wouldn't have hurt).  Also like that album, she sounds vibrant and alive.  No, she doesn't always sound full of zip and energy -- sometimes she's contemplative or melancholy.  When she's not down in the dumps, however, her piano solos are sounding quite stirring and forceful, relative to her previous work of course (she's not trying to be Cecil Taylor, mind you!)    So what about the songs?  Alas, if you are looking to hear her sing songs you have been hearing on and off for decades by many other artists since the dawn of time, you are bound to be disappointed.  \\"The Girl In The Other Room\\" is not an album of old \\"standards,\\" but rather it is a collection of new original tunes and some other tunes interpreted by Diana, tunes that are not traditionally associated with jazz.  But does she ever jazz them up!  Elvis Costello's \\"Almost Blue\\" will be familiar primarily to Costello fans as that moody torch song on his 1982 album \\"Imperial Bedroom.\\"  Here, it is finally cast as it should be: as a jazzy torch song sung by a first class jazz singer (no disrespect to Elvis, I like his version too).  And how about that Tom Waits tune, \\"Temptation\\"?  Well, those familiar with Mr. Waits know that he has always had a touch of jazz in his blood -- just listen to his \\"Nighthawks at the Diner\\" album and dare to tell me that you couldn't imagine ol' Charlie Mingus enjoying a performance like that!  Well, \\"Temptation\\" is finally in the hands of an established jazz artist, and you know what?  It sounds positively sexy as performed by Diana, and dig that bass player!  Christian McBride, right?  Sounds like he's excited just to be in the same room as Ms. Krall.  You can feel it.    I could go on and on about how the title track takes the sound of her trio recordings and casts it in a more thoughtful light, or how touching \\"Departure Bay\\" is, etc.  You'll just have to listen for yourself.  Personally, I think this album is, thus far, Ms. Krall's crowning achievement.  It's heartening to know that she has a far deeper well of material from which to draw than her previous albums indicated.

B0000025D0|5.0|Springsteen delves deeply into the darkness that we all struggle against on this one. Listen to the near gospel howling on \\"Adam Raised a Cain,\\" and you know right away that Springsteen is reaching for nothing less than displaying the personal pain of the human condition. Never one to shy away from putting himself on the line for his music, Springsteen makes a true masterpiece here. Frustration, longing, and all the dark places that can be found in the soul are on display here; he doesn't hide from it or cover it with a wry smile. But he also doesn't allow anyone to give up, you fight it or you accept it, but you don't quit. The band does their part, creating a sound that reflects the emotional content of the lyrics perfectly. It's not his easiest album to listen to, but it is easily one of his best.
B00008EY65|3.0|I went into HELLBOY uninitiated.  I hadn't read the comic but had seen some of the artwork.  Needless to say, I was intrigued by both MIKE MIGNOLA's cool artwork and the spiffy trailer.  The film turned out to be slightly dissapointing.  Not a bad flick, HELLBOY does have decent FX and some interesting characters, however the movie is lacking a flowing plot that takes away from what could've been a cool story.  RON PEARLMAN looks great, but the weak script gives him nothing but cheesy, cliched dialogue.  It's a shame to cast an enigmatic actor like him in the lead and give him so little to work with.  The rest of the characters work fairly the same.  Half fish-half man ABE SAPIEN is about the coolest thing in the film, but all but dissapears halfway through.  There were many elements without full explaination prevalent throughout the picture, which leads one to believe that the comic is much more in-depth than you can adapt to the big screen.  Director GUILLERMO DEL TORO has a great eye, but doesn't know how to bridge together a script with holes.  HELLBOY simply lacks the true engagement of a good yarn.  Which is too bad really, because everything about the production pointed to a hell of a good movie watching experience.
B00027JYLC|5.0|I've seen this film several time over the decades and this was the best viewing ever - why? Because of the hour long documentary that gives us biographies for the various sideshow performers. It gives a deeper appreciation to their lives. David J. Skal enlightens us about them - and also fills us in on the various endings MGM tried to use.  It also touches on why Tod Browning's career ended.  Warners did a great job at giving this film a sense of context with the bonus features instead of just tossing out a barebones DVD.
B000062YAZ|5.0|The speed , the ferocity, agresivity , out of this world!!!!! , Slayers , reign in blood is the most impresive heavy metal album ever made , neither Slayer itself have been able to release onother album such as this masterpiece , the legend is as follows: the tracks recording during, the sessions were so loaded of anger , madness and adrenaline that when album was finished the band members were shock when they discovered that this great album barely reached the 30 minutes duration, but this is a part of this awesome history, and Slayer can be proud since untill the end of this world never will be recorded another album like Reign in blood, sorry for the nu metal bands but their efforts are futile

B000000JO3|5.0|As the above Amazon review states, this is the original gospel according to Ian MacKaye, but it is also more than that: this is the gospel of real punk rock.  Vitrol fueled and seething with everything that made the punk rock movement of the 80's great, Minor Threat's \\"Complete Discography\\" is not only a punk rock masterpiece, but an excellent gateway for new fans of the band.  \\"I Don't Wanna Hear It\\", \\"Seeing Red\\", \\"Straight Edge\\", \\"Stand Up\\", \\"In My Eyes\\", \\"Out of Step\\", \\"Sob Story\\", and \\"Salad Days\\" are some of the best pieces of music to ever come out of the punk scene from one of the greatest bands to ever emerge from the genre.  Just like Black Flag's \\"Damaged\\", Dead Kennedys' \\"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables\\", and the Misfits' \\"Walk Among Us\\"; this is an absolute masterpiece and entirely essential.
B00003CXCT|5.0|WOW.  Where do I start...for one, I am a fan of the original trilogy and am also a fan of the special edition releases in '97 (for no other reason than to see A New Hope and the rest in a packed movie house again).  Too bad that there has been so much damage done to the franchise, not the least of which is the gross myopia of Lucas himself when he defends that awful mess known as Episode II.  I am not going to get into the whole \\"keep your hands off our trilogy\\" debate, because I think that is a waste of time -- the changes are here to stay people.  Unless you have 250 million and the rights to the films, you're stuck with what is out there.  I am relieved that Episodes IV - VI are finally coming to DVD and I personally am looking forward to John Williams on my surround sound system at home.  Now if the changes made in this release are typical Lucas myopia, well that only means I'll be using the skip button a little more than normal.  Out.
B000056N8X|5.0|There are really multiple versions of each highlander movie. Here is a<br /><br />guide.<br /><br />#1 HIGHLANDER (1986)  There are 2 versions of this film. The American version is much shorter and a lot of scenes and flashbacks have been removed. There is one added shot where the bald policeman spills coffee on himself. There is also one line of dialogue added and some slight differences in the soundtrack.  The European version is longer and also available in America. A \\"SPECIAL VERSION\\" which will feature an altered ending and better continuity with the sequels/TV series is reportedly in the works.<br /><br />#2 HIGHLANDER II (THE QUICKENING) (1990) There are 5 versions<br /><br />of  this film.  The first is the theatrical version that played in USA. The<br /><br />Second is European version which has one scene added and a longer<br /><br />ending in which Connor and Louse are transformed into energy or<br /><br />spirits or something and are transported off to Zeist.<br /><br />The third version was the first cut of the \\"RENEGADE VERSION\\"<br /><br />which added about 16 minutes of new scenes. Removed about 5 min.<br /><br />and has a different origin for the immortals. It was only released on<br /><br />home video in pan and scan.<br /><br />The fourth version is the same as the third, but  was in widescreen<br /><br />video.

The second version was released in US<br /><br />by Miramax  as HIGHLANDER: THE FINAL DIMENSION .They added some new optical effects and stock shots from the first movie and also changed some of the dialogue and music. It was also edited to get a PG 13 rating. The third version was an R rated version of the above.<br /><br />Version four Is the same as the original European version but bears<br /><br />the FINAL DIMENSION title and has some of  the same music as the<br /><br />American version.

B000002MG1|5.0|Wow, it seems strange labeling a CD that I bought when it came out as \\"Classic\\", but this will without doubt be one of those that are on the all time collections fifty years from now.   <br /> <br />Automatic is darker than their wonderful \\"Out Of Time\\", but it is more even and shows more skill.  In short add this to your collection!
0553573403|2.0|2 stars because at least the writing was engaging<br /><br />I am almost finished with this tome. At first I thought the book was good, and it was hard to stop reading. The characters were engaging and interesting. But, as the book dragged on and I on I realized that I was being set up for a soap opera in which there was no intention of resolution, only more words and more invented accidents that kept the three story lines going. This is a soap opera, not a novel. It is just wandering through the characters until they are all dead. There is no hint at the resolution because it would not be a masterwork without at least three volumes of at least 700 pages. It seems that the author is getting paid by the word even though the words are readable, which is more than I can say for some recent authors. At least tolkien worked towards something other than wrack and ruin. Read this if you like reading. It has no great redeeming theme other than death comes in many packages. The northern watch episodes are just grim forboding of something that may or may not occur. The desert episode needs a tragedy to connect it back to the main episode. You can see this really early in the book. And the main episode depends on the bumbling of the good guys. Not a very inspiring message. It would be nice to find an author that can write a story with a beginning and an end in the same volume.
0971057907|5.0|I came across this book from visiting John Palmer's web site.  He is nice enough to let you see the entire first edition online.  I admire his willingness to share, and I purchased a copy of the second edition.  Although it is very similar to the online text, it has been updated, and having a hard copy of this excellent reference is a must. <br /> <br />For those wanting to brew and brew right out of the gate, Mr. Palmer starts off explaining every step of the process clearly and in a very straight forward manner.  I found this book to be one of the best organized and clearly laid out brewing guides I've come across. <br /> <br />If you want more information other than just the mechanics of how to brew, it is in here too.  Yeast, malts, hops, water, the boil, fermentation, equipment, all grain, and building your own equipment (and more) are thoroughly covered. <br /> <br />If you can't find this book on Amazon, go to your local homebrew store and pick up a copy.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Slipknot's music is a little different on this album, Corey's vocals are great and different from the past albums, Joey on drums is awesome and fast (In my opinion best metal drummer.) Mick and Jim are giving to their guitars a little Slayer style in some of the songs, probably because of the influence of Rick Rubin. <br />In my opinion this is not Slipknot's best album, but I accept that this is the most melodic and some of the lyrics have a lot passion. <br />* The songs you have to consider in this album are: <br />Duality (1st. Single) <br />Vermillion (Resident Evil Apocalypse Soundtrack) <br />Vermillion Part 2 (It's a great acoustic song and the 2nd Single) <br />The Nameless (Amazing vocals) <br />Before I Forget(Good lyrics) <br />Prelude 3.0 & Danger, Keep Away (Good Intro & Outro) <br /> <br />+ Note: <br />There's is a Japanese version of this album featuring a bonus track, my recomendation to you is to buy it, only if you're crazy over Slipknot (Like me), But if you're new to the band just get the normal US version. Because the bonus track on the Japanese version is not worth the extra money you'll have to pay.
0385720920|3.0|Choke is good.  Not great, but good.<br /><br />If you've read anything else he's ever written, you'll probably think less of Choke than \\"good.\\"  Even now, I'm having a hard time removing myself from my disappointment in order to look at the text objectively.  I keep thinking, \\"He could've done so much better.\\"<br /><br />Palahniuk's prose is a taste to be acquired.  Like mushrooms, sardines, or black licorice, some people like it, some people don't.  No problem there.<br /><br />Palahniuk's stories, however, are all exercises in fringe-living and existential glee (the type of life view that makes you think it's nihilism before revealing itself to be more of a perpetual self-examination).  What all of this intelligentsia means is that Palahniuk seems to be saying that Life Makes Sense, it's just that no one's figured it out yet.  In all of his novels, he searches for even just an iota of this meaning, and in most of them, I would argue, he succeeds.<br /><br />Choke, however, is far too rote and formulaic to reveal anything other than the gears within Palahniuk's brain.  Choke, I think, was written to appeal to the masses.  He still has his off-color and cult-style appeal going for him, but it surrounds a tale so overtly moralistic and (at the same time) moralistically ambivalent that it leaves little to no impression.<br /><br />At heart, the tale is about Victor, who is addicted to sex.  The book is, true to this summation, necessarily graphic and visceral.  Palahniuk's actual prose has lost none of its vinegar and ice here.  It is only the story's progression and eventual resolution that end up playing out like vanilla ice cream.  Sure, sure, sure.  There are bowel obstructions, sloppy sex scenes, and other subversive biological moments, but they culminate in a moment so cliched and trite that you have to wonder if Palahniuk didn't stuff his normally acerbic wit into a Hollywood Fable Factory in order to crank out this entertaining albeit ultimately disappointing Lesson to the Masses.<br /><br />If you want to see Chuck at the top of his game, start with Invisible Monsters or Lullabye.  (For film buffs, Choke is to Palahniuk as Intolerable Cruelty is to the Coen brothers...good, but no great feat.)appointing Lesson to the Masses. <br /> <br />If you want to see Chuck at the top of his game, start with Invisible Monsters or Lullabye.

0553208845|5.0|This is a great book, written by a German, about Eastern philosophy.  I would recommend getting acquainted with the history, religion and philosophy it deals with before reading it, so you'll have a greater appreciation for what's going on.<br /><br />It's pretty much the whole life story or Siddhartha, as he goes on a journey of enlightenment.  Read it and think about your own faith and ideals.
B00000IBDY|5.0|It's been noted that this sole 1968 record by the short-lived UK psych band was one of the best lp's of that era as well as it's always been highly under-rated. I would tend to agree with that opinion. This reissue of the Tomorrow record is really quite nice,with the lp's eleven tracks along with twelve bonus tunes tagged on for good measure. A total of 23 songs. Wow! A truly great psychedelic release to own. The disc's gems are easy to spot, like \\"My White Bicycle\\" (the same tune Nazareth opens some of their gigs with), the timeless \\"Revolution\\", \\"Three Jolly Little Dwarfs\\" and \\"Hallucinations\\". Most of you probably, of course know about Tomorrow's line-up. That it included guitarist Steve Howe (before he joined Yes), heart-throb Keith West on vocals and drummer Twink before he joined up with the Pink Fairies. Sort of a historic record, one COULD say. The extra tunes are about as good as the actual lp. Sort of dug \\"Why\\" and the mono version of the previously mentioned \\"Revolution\\" as well as the three cuts by The Aquarian Age, a side project by Twink and the band's bassist, Junior. Thought the spoken word track, skit, whatever... \\"Good Wizard Meets Naughty Wizard\\" was a gas. To end things, there are four decent Keith West solo tracks. Comes with a beautifully-designed 12-page booklet with PLENTY of cool photos, artwork and info. A must have.
0446310786|5.0|I like this book a lot, not just for its themes of social justice, but also just for its characters.  Atticus is someone everyone should try to emulate, and I love Scout. <br />The movie's awesome too.
0141439734|4.0|This is an interesting book to read, although since pretty much everyone know's what's going to happen, that takes some of the fun out of it. <br />Other than that, it has some good points to think about, good for provoking ruminations on what your own ideas about the goodness/evilness of your own self!
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Interstella 5555 is an amazing production. The combination of the Discovery album and superb animation create a story which needs no dialogue to enhance. The series of videos aired for the Discovery record in addition to those created for the accompanying songs create a movie chroicling the events around an abducted musical group, their captor, and the hero who frees them from their captivity.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Solid, moving, entertaining movie about life, love, and the hard times of the Civil War. The battle sequences are incredibly moving and depict the gore of war in a gritty and realistic fashion. But the majority of the story focuses on Jude Law, a southern patriot stricken by love and Nicole Kidman, bereaved daughter left fatherless and penniless in a merciless, hard-scrabble time in North Carolina.<br /><br />Renee Zellweger steals the show with her brilliant interpretation of \\"Ruby\\"! The critics are silenced as Ruby spits, swears, and melts our hearts in convincing style. Zellweger doesn't portray this character, she becomes her and adds breath and life to this tough-minded, practical, hard-working ragamuffin.<br /><br />Equally riveting is the performance of Natalie Portman as the desperate widow protecting her new-born baby and scraping a living out of a hard-gravel southern farm. Inman visits her and both their lives are forever touched by the encounter.<br /><br />I appreciated the quality of acting, beautiful scenery, and poignant story. Very good film.
B000099T2L|3.0|Okay, the album was good, but let me just do my little criticisms first.    True, this is Beyonce's album, but why does she feel the need to get a lot of guest singers? We've got Luther Vandross, Jay-Z (twice!), Missy Elliot, Sean Paul... are all of these people necessary? Well, I'll admit that Jay-Z was very good on \\"Crazy in Love,\\" but the other people? \\"Baby Boy\\" doesn't even qualify as just Beyonce's track since all she seems to do is sing the chorus. \\"Signs\\" is a brilliant ballad, but is Missy Elliot really needed? Seems like she was just tossed in there for no apparent reason except to be featured on Beyonce's album. Jay-Z was good on \\"Crazy in Love,\\" but why does he need another track? Big Boi and Sleepy Brown in \\"Hip Hop Star\\"?... well, that was actually decent. And Luther Vandross... eh, kinda boring.    There is no need to feature that many people especially on a solo album. That kinda makes Beyonce look like she can't do it by herself.    And the last track kinda bugs me. It's shown as a \\"Hidden Track\\" but it's really not so hidden when it's clearly shown on the back CD cover. Although it's a great song, I can't help but wonder what would happen if her unborn kid turns out to be a girl? Anyone think of that? It just raises questions is all.    Aside from my rants, this is a very good album. Love and sex are the main topics here, but don't expect something like the God-awful \\"In the Zone\\" by Britney. Songs here are more creative and they have upbeat rhythms that you could dance to (some of 'em, that is). Some of the ballads I think are brilliant. \\"Speechless\\" is by far the best track here. A slow tempo, a guitar in background, and Beyonce's soothing voice and yelling \\"Yes!\\" numerous times make this seem like it could be used in a \\"blue movie\\" scene if ya know what I mean. An incredibly sexy track. And who could forget \\"Me, Myself, and I\\"? Another brilliant song that seems more suggestive of woman empowerment. But towards the end of the album, it kinda goesdownhill. It gets... boring.    Beyonce is a beautiful woman. She's got an amazing voice, but she would've done a heck of a lot better had she done the tracks by her self. Yes, the album earned her 5 Grammys, but that doesn't mean this album is THAT good.    These are my favorite tracks off the album:  1. Speechless  2. Me, Myself, and I  3. Crazy in Love  4. Naughty Girl  5. Dangerously in Love 2
B00008EY65|4.0|The movie is based off the comic hellboy, though I have not read hellboy it has been said to be loyal to the original material.  The movie starts in the latter period of World War 2.  The Nazi's feel that they are going to los the war, and are desperately looking for an edge or a weapon to turn the tides.  So an enigmatic figure creates a gate to the resting place of a very HP Lovecraft inspired creature, alien, powerful, and destrucive.  But a Professor Bloom and a a group of American soldiers were there as part of a new paranormal government agency.  They manage to stop this but find a humanoid creature with devil like features, but a complete child.  The professor takes him in and nurtures him to become a hero and an member of his agency.<br /><br />The movie skips forward to modern day times.  Hellboy is an adolescent, but bigger than the average body builder.  He eats insane quantities of food and has a strange affinity for cats, and they cover his room.  Rumors of hellboys existence are all over the papers, but regarded as rumor and local legend by many.  Along with an aquatic pyschic, a woman who can start flames, and more mundane government agents(men in black).<br /><br />The plot is based off the ressurection of the one that opened the portal he came through.  He is paired with the woman he peformed the ritual with, and a strange man who is mostly artificial, a lot of his body parts and movements are a complex set of gears, like a clock.<br /><br />This movie was very well made.  I have to agree with a lot of its critics, the character development was a bit slow, but it was worth the wait.  The acting was top notch, the villians menacing and mysterious, well cast, the good guys quirky and 3 dimensional, and Ron Pearlman shines as Hellboy, a creature trying to pass for human.<br /><br />Hellboy himself is an intersting character.  He goes to the length of filing his horns down to look more human, there is a funny scene of him working on them with a sander, and he doesn't like them looked at.  He has a strange sense of humor from being locked up and having to be kept a secret.  Though he is huge, he is still mentally and emotionally an adolescent, often breaking out of the confines to see his crush.  He likes cats so much that he defends a basket of kittens while fighting an evil monster.  Ron Pearlman doesn't play Hellboy, he is hellboy.<br /><br />The plot is interesting and well paced.  The action sequences were fun and kept things interesting.  The plot exposition is informative without being too wordy.<br /><br />Despite its flaws this is a very enjoyable film.  Appealing to those interested in HP Lovecraft like horror, comic books, science fiction, the occult, and action movies.  I look forward to the sequel, and the cast of strange villians and heroes they will introduce.ed at.  He has a strange sense of humor from being locked up and having to be kept a secret.

0064407667|5.0|As an adult, I picked these books up to see if these would be a good book for my child to read.  And for a elementary children, this is a wonderful book.  The read is relatively quick so they aren't overwhelmed by the thickness and it is still a fun story with characters that you feel terribly bad for. <br /> <br />The prose is perfect for children.  It is easy to read and filled with alliteration.  Best of all, this book goes out of its way to teach vocabulary to children.  Instead of filling the book with long words (for children) expecting the children to look up the words they didn't understand (which they won't), it goes out of its way to explain the bigger words. <br /> <br />This is the story of the Baudelaire siblings and begins right after the death of their parents.  Orphaned, the children are placed into the care of a distant relative named Count Olaf.  It doesn't take long for the children to realize that Count Olaf does not care for the children but only in the fortune that Violet, the eldest of the three children, is set to inherit.  Soon, a scheme is hatched by Count Olaf to take control of the fortune and the only thing that can help the Baudelaire orphans is their wit, wisdom, and bravery. <br /> <br />You are warned at the beginning of the book, and throughout, that this book does not have a happy ending.  It is part right.  The book does not have the best ending, but it doesn't have the worst ending either.  I'll pick up the other books, but it does appear that this book will not leave you hanging and wishing for a different ending.  Actually, I prefer this ending which shows that not everything will go your way which is the norm in life and not the exception.  I don't think elementary school aged children are too young to start learning this, if they haven't already. <br /> <br />If you have young children (grades 2-6) I would highly recommend you encourage them to read this series.  This would be a good step into getting them to like reading.  Harry Potter, while it is a fantastic read, should be left to those who are slightly older and/or better readers than who this book is targetted towards.
0375507256|5.0|Was handed this book by a friend based on the fact that I'd read 'Ghostwritten' and enjoyed. But mainly started reading because I trust his taste on all things of the written word... <br /> <br />And all I can say is that you MUST READ this book. I haven't been able to put down and actually look forward to my morning train ride to work for the chance to open the pages. Give each story a bit of time to get into - as they're all written with such a different style and flavour. And you need to know the characters, which he always gets around to. <br /> <br />Such a fresh voice - thank you England!
B00005JNEI|5.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 has its share of faults but definitely accomplishes one very important thing in the current climate of rightwing information dominance: it systematically picks apart the lies and secrets of the unelected regime of George W. Bush. Among the many facts that cause audience members to gasp when they see this film are: <br /> <br />--The illegal manner in which the Bush team rigged the election in Florida largely by disenfranchising eligible Black Democrat voters. <br /> <br />--The fact that the Bush family has done business with terrorists (namely the bin Laden family) for decades and treasonously allowed the bin Laden family to leave the United States immediately after the attacks of September 11th , before other flights were allowed to resume and before the FBI could question them. <br /> <br />--The fact that far from showing \\"courage and leadership\\" immediately after the attacks of September 11th, unelected President Bush sat in a class room for several minutes reading \\"My Pet Goat\\" to children with a stunned expression on his face.  <br /> <br />--The fact that the Bush regime manipulated legitimate fears of terror among the nation's citizens mostly with bizarre warnings and a meaningless color code system in order to force through a deeply unpopular right wing agenda of social and economic policies that are extremely harmful to all but the most wealthy Americans. Actually, in the long run these policies will destroy them too, they are just too short-sited to realize this. <br /> <br />--The fact that not one congressional leader read the totalitarian provisions of the USAPATRIOT Act before voting for it. Not one. <br /> <br />--The fact that the Bush regime abandoned all but the rhetoric behind the war on terror in order to pursue its pre-election dream of colonizing Iraq. <br /> <br />--The fact that the situation is Iraq is a disaster. We are destroying peoples' lives, and randomly arresting and torturing people there. Our troops are getting killed and wounded in a war that is based exclusively on the lies of George W. Bush and on the aims of right wing zealots and oil companies. <br /> <br />--The fact that American companies flagrantly admit that the war in Iraq is a colonial occupation from which they profit. <br /> <br />--The fact that none of the children of war proponents ever have to risk their lives in this war, only the poor do. <br /> <br />None of this is new of course to anyone who read political biographies and newspapers. The accomplishment of \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is that it captures a lot of publicly available information that has previously been relegated to the back pages of newspapers and brings it into our movie houses and living rooms so that even the most delusional of us can no longer pretend that the Bush Regime is legitimate and that it knows what it's doing.  <br />
B00008PX8P|5.0|What can u say about this peice of work that hasn't aleady been said. In a golden era of music (there were The Stones, The Who, Hendrix, T-rex the list goes on) one band stood out head and shoulders  above the rest and this disc shows why. Unfortunately I was born 10 years too late to see the mighty Zep live but I distintlvely remember being in school one day and wondering why many of the older lads were in a state of shock. Someone told me that some guy called Jon Bonham had died and it was a big deal. Who the hell is Jon Bonham was my first thought. To cut a long story short a week later Zeppelin 2 was spinning on my record player and I was completely blown away, so began my lifelong affair with the band. I've seen Robert Plant live many times since and he is exceptional but I always wondered what the real deal would be like. This DVD goes a long way to answering those questions, ok maybe not as good as actually being there but for a fan like me who never had the opportunity of seeing them live its the next best thing. I literally had goose bumps the first time I listened to it and for me \\"Kashmir\\" at Knebworth is quite simply 8-10 minutes of music Nirvana. It just doesn't get any better than this. Buy it now.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|The Beatles rejected the GET BACK album upon its completion in 1969 and again in 1970.  The project (renamed LET IT BE) then got the Phil Spector treatment, with Paul being kept completely in the dark about it.  Many have called the Spector album shoddy, but most Beatles fans bought it and enjoyed it despite the consensus that it was not top-notch.<br /><br />At one time The Beatles were capable of producing much magic \\"live\\" in the studio--and they had done it often.  But after they quit touring, the lack of playing together eventually took its toll, John admitting that \\"The Beatles musically weren't as together in the last few years.\\"  John also said that these sessions had \\"lousy feeling.\\"  But within the album notes to this new release, marketing mentality strikes once again and, rather typically, attempts to put a spin on these \\"raw and unadorned\\" sessions, saying that this is what the group wanted. \\"Raw and unadorned\\" shouldn't be confused with \\"careless and crude.\\"  The latter two are not what the group was shooting for, but a fair amount of that made it onto the tapes because of their lack of desire to focus on making music.  (Just a few months later they did focus on making music and produced ABBEY ROAD!)<br /><br />I still look at LET IT BE as a compilation of rehearsals; little of it sounds finished.  Though the songs themselves are great, the performances are not, for the most part, of the highest Beatles standard.  Sure, there are many magical moments throughout; but the magic is fleeting, and we are continually reminded of a great producer's absence--George Martin!  These recordings are culled from sessions that, had the proper commitment been there, should have produced a remarkable Beatles album along the lines of what we were accustomed to.  Each attempt at presenting these sessions only leaves me wondering what could have been if George Martin had been allowed to fully produce them.  That said, here's what we get this time around:<br /><br />\\"Get Back\\" is noticeably cleaner than the previous releases.  But this version fades out quickly before Paul's \\"ooo-oo,\\" leaving it sounding truncated--annoyingly unresolved.  Overall, I still prefer the 1969-single version with its very satisfying ending, the version we fans thrilled to for a full year before the Spector LP appeared.<br /><br />The electric piano in \\"Dig A Pony\\" is more prominent here; otherwise, there is not much difference between this account and Spector's.  \\"For You Blue\\" reveals little difference as well.<br /><br />\\"The Long And Winding Road\\" is a different take from Spector's, and, as another reviewer astutely points out, we get lots of rehearsal-like \\"plinky dink\\" playing, unworthy of a finished Beatles song.  It is typical for musicians to play with this type of uncertainty when the arrangement is still in the building stage, and here the uncertain piano fills don't carry the song's emotion between Paul's vocal lines.  The tempo surges at times, and this whole take is pretty much a rough run-through.  Though the combination of orchestra and choir on Spector's version periodically strikes me as being unnatural, I never thought that it transported the song to the world of Mantovani.  In fact, I never realized just how much I love the Spector account until I sat and compared these two versions at length.<br /><br />\\"Two Of Us\\" reveals no significant variation except that it fades out before the guitars stop and before John's whistling goes charmingly out of tune, present on the Spector version.<br /><br />We are given a different rendition of \\"I've Got A Feeling.\\"  It is not quite as hot, matching neither the emotion in the vocals nor the intensity and drive of the performance Spector chose for his album.  I also like Preston's piano line better on the Spector track.<br /><br />Top honors go to NAKED for the better mix of \\"One After 909.\\"  The song really comes alive here.  One very consequential difference is that Ringo's bass drum has punch on NAKED; on the Spector it's pure mud.  The added punch gives the song an infectious--even delirious--drive that it never had before.  Unfortunately, the fade at the end is quick so as not to catch the live atmosphere.<br /><br />This take of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is rehearsal quality all the way; it pales in every respect compared with the glorious single version released in 1969.<br /><br />On Spector's \\"I Me Mine,\\" the strings are heard where, on this new mix, the organ pops through more noticeably.<br /><br />And here, \\"Across The Universe\\" is back to its original speed.  Though the Spector treatment sounds neither preferable nor wrong (John certainly liked it), this NAKED one sounds, well, naked.  I still prefer the original version found on PAST MASTERS VOLUME TWO.  That one sounds closer to the John of early 1968 who made bizarre requests of George Martin, wanting a song \\"to sound like an orange\\" and such.<br /><br />Finally, this remix of the title track brings the organ up front more, we miss the electric piano on the first walk-down before the guitar solo, and the brass is gone.  The new version also omits the third-verse edit found in the Spector version.  But this mix bewilders me:  Is it substantive and worthwhile?  Or is it a run-of-the-mill account, one more from a potentially endless parade of remixes?  George's guitar solo is different yet again.  So what?  If you ask me, the single version (found on PAST MASTERS VOLUME TWO and the SINGLES boxed set) still says it best.<br /><br />Though I still prefer Spector's LET IT BE, I cannot recommend it over this cleaned-up version to all listeners.  Each has strengths; neither is perfect.<br /><br />The album notes assert that this edition reveals how the album was meant to be.  Didn't the Spector album make the same assertion?  So much for promises.has punch on NAKED; on the Spector it's pure mud.  The added punch gives the song an infectious--even delirious--drive that it never had before.  Unfortunately, the fade at the end is quick so as not to catch the live atmosphere. <br /> <br />This take of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is rehearsal quality all the way; it pales in every respect compared with the glorious single version released in 1969. <br /> <br />On Spector's \\"I Me Mine,\\" the strings are heard where, on this new mix, the organ pops through more noticeably. <br /> <br />And here, \\"Across The Universe\\" is back to its original speed.  Though the Spector treatment sounds neither preferable nor wrong (John certainly liked it), this NAKED one sounds, well, naked.  I still prefer the original version found on PAST MASTERS VOLUME TWO.  That one sounds closer to the John of early 1968 who made bizarre requests of George Martin, wanting a song \\"to sound like an orange\\" and such. <br /> <br />Finally, this remix of the title track brings the organ up front more, we miss the electric piano on the first walk-down before the guitar solo, and the brass is gone.  The new version also omits the third-verse edit found in the Spector version.  But this mix bewilders me:  Is it substantive and worthwhile?  Or is it a run-of-the-mill account, one more from a potentially endless parade of remixes?  George's guitar solo is different yet again.  So what?  If you ask me, the single version (found on PAST MASTERS VOLUME TWO and the SINGLES boxed set) still says it best. <br /> <br />Though I still prefer Spector's LET IT BE, I cannot recommend it over this cleaned-up version to all listeners.  Each has strengths; neither is perfect. <br /> <br />The album notes assert that this edition reveals how the album was meant to be.  Didn't the Spector album make the same assertion?  So much for promises. <br />
B00024BHTC|4.0|Before i even speak about the album, i would like to condemn the nitwit who is repeatedly writing one star reviews(the guy who is using words like total and utter crap), and has nothing better to do than to passionately hate a band(and lower the rating of an excellent cd that doesnt deserve it). I have one thing to say to you as a musician myself: i'd like to see you write and orchestrate a record better than the \\"total and utter crap\\" that you are calling this album. NOTE: almost all of the one star reviews are by the same person, who keeps reviewing the same albums(some van halen, metallica, malmsteen, steve vai stuff and this album) over and over again on different names and giving them one stars to lower their average rating.     Enough venting, Once is the furthest thing from dissapointing if you liked their earlier albums. Tuomas Holopainen said they were going to aim for a more orchestral and almost film score feel. Thats exactly what they produced. Century Child touched on it a little, and with this album they went into it head first. I dont feel the songwriting is as strong as it has been in the past(there are a few slight stinkers on this album, Romanticide's verse melody is horribly unappealing, and some of the chorus melodies are a bit predictable and in some cases repetitive, like in the case of Dead Gardens). Particularly attractive songs are Dark Chest of Wonders, Nemo, Ghost Love Score, the song in finnish, and the Siren.     In short, Nightwish fans will not be dissapointed, new listeners should listen to Century Child first. This album is rather experimental when compared to their earlier stuff, especially Oceanborn and Wishmaster, so grab those albums before this one if you havent already.
0792833236|5.0|Raging Bull is not just any film. It is THE best sports movie, bar-none. It also has to be one of the best movies ever made. Martin Scorsese thought that this film would be the last film that he would ever make. Boy, was he wrong. This film sky-rocketed him higher than Taxi Driver - at that time, the pinnacle of his career).    What makes this movie special is that all of the elements fit together snuggly and make a wonderful masterpiece. First of all, De Niro's performance has got to be one of the greatest ever. I'm not just talking about the fact that he gained 50 pounds for the latter scenes (which even that deserved Oscar consideration in itself) but the fact that he WAS boxing legend Jake La Motta. He took on the character and became him. Sadly, there aren't many actors who are notable for the method acting technique - which De Niro studied - anymore, but it works and it makes the performance as great as it can be.    The other elements of the film are top notch. The other actors - Pesci, Moriarty, Vincent - did a superb and memorable job, which highly supplemented De Niro's performance. The editing is picture-perfect, expecially during those multiple-angled boxing sequences. What I admire most about this film is the choice of black and white cinematography. I know it sounds like a turn off for some, but it really puts you into the 40's and 50's period, and the cinematography looks incredible. Even the score was memorable. Scorsese certainly has a knack of enhancing extraordinary scenes with extraordinary music - the opening sequence never fails to bring a tear to my eye.    All the other elements are excellent. The whole film itself should've won all of the Oscars that it was nominated for - it was robbed of the best picture by the bland after-school-special-like-film \\"Ordinary People\\" - but I am satisfied with the Oscars that Deniro and editor Thelma Schoonermaker won.     This is a must see film!
B000002KNI|5.0|To say that this is the best Simon & Garfunkel album will perhaps offend some fans who love their acoustic folk-pop of the late 60s. But it is, and their most accessible, too. Even casual listeners who aren't usually fans of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel should enjoy this terrific live recording.    The concert in Central Park took place a decade after the duo's initial break-up, and Simon & Garfunkel are backed (but by no means overwhelmed) by a full band which includes a subtle, well-used horn section.  They perform numerous S&G classics, and a number of wonderfully executed songs from Paul Simon's solo albums as well. Art Garfunkel adds top-notch harmony vocals to several numbers, and there is barely a weak track on this entire record.  This album is much more lively than their strictly acoustic early outings, and it is the most appealing, enjoyable and immediately accessible item in the entire S&G catalogue.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I won't waste space repeating what respected students of cinema, critics, and film fans have already said, and said much better than I can.  This is simply a remarkable movie--haunting, funny, sad, boisterous, bigger-than-life.  Whenever I watch the scenes of Welles portraying Kane as a young man, running the Enquirer, I get a lump in my throat:  so young and vibrant, totally unconcerned with the conventional wisdom about how movies should be made.  The twinkle in his eyes is his wink at the viewer; he's a magician (Welles literally was) letting you know that you're watching an illusion, and he's almost--but not quite--letting you in on the secret.  The secret, of course, is that all really good magic is mostly stagecraft and patter, and Citizen Kane is almost nothing but stagecraft and patter.  I think that's the secret of its ongoing appeal for me.  I like the fact that you can see some of the behind-the-scenes gizmos that make the trick work, and that it's still astonishing when you see the trick unfold.   <br />The commentary by Roger Ebert for the 2-DVD set is terrific, by the way, despite a few small gaffs (e.g., Kane's friend is Jed Leland, not Jeb).  Don't deny yourself the pleasure of seeing Orson Welles and Gregg Toland, his photographer, pull out all the stops.
B00012BD0S|1.0|This review pertains strictly to the re-release. These new re-releases of the Symphony X disography is a terrible concept. Inside Out records has packaged the music to where there are no individual tracks. Merely one large one. It's a bummer because you can't rip them onto your computer so that you may place any of the individual songs on a \\"best of\\" type CD for you car or Diskman. <br /> <br />Go with the regular release.
B000002L6P|4.0|This, of course, was Madonna's second album.  It featured several smash hits, which are now regarded as '80s pop classics.  You are no doubt familiar with those songs, so there is no need for me to discuss them.  Instead, I will discuss the non-hit songs here.  \\"Over and Over\\" is a terrific song that is the best of the non-singles.  \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" is a cover version of a song by disco group Rose Royce.  I hate this song.  Madonna, however, must like it more than I do, because she released it as a single 12 years later (it flopped).  The rest of the songs, \\"Shoo-Bee-Doo\\", \\"Pretender\\" and \\"Stay\\" are okay songs that don't have much depth to them.  This is really the album that made Madonna a superstar, but her singing and songwriting still had not fully developed at the time.  The best was yet to come.
B000002GXX|4.0|It has been agreed by many, that the Eagles self-titled album was a bit of a dud.  Sure it included \\"Witchy Woman\\" and \\"Take it Easy\\", but the remaining album tracks were quite ordinary. <br /> <br />After that, two more albums were released including \\"Desperado\\" and \\"On the Border\\".  These two albums were an improvement on the first, but not outstanding. <br /> <br />Along comes the \\"One of these Nights\\" album in 1975. WOW, in one word.  This is nothing short of brilliant. The album tracks are just as good as the lifted singles, which is also the case for Hotel california.  What I do like about \\"\\"One of these Nights\\" is that it defines their talents clearly (eg. Journey of the Sorcerer, Hollywood Waltz), opening the way for \\"Hotel California\\".  I never tire of playing this album.  The digital remaster version adds more life to an already excellent soundtrack, and is worth hunting down. <br /> <br />Eagles - have been one of my favourite bands since I was 8.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|As the follow-up to Brave New World, Dance of Death shows that Iron Maiden have chosen to stick with their roots.  Bruce Dickenson uses his awesome vocal range to sing wonderful songs with three legendary guitarists, Nicko on drums, and Harris on the bass.  I bought this album shortly after it was released because I was purchasing tickets to see them live in Los Angeles in support for this album in January.<br /><br />The opening song, Wildest Dreams, is a fun song, but hey, what can ever top intro tracks like Aces High, or The Wickerman??!  Track 3, which is titled, No More Lies, is a great song, with awesome leads.  Dance of Death, Age of Innocence, and Face in the Sand are all of equal calibur, and are good.  For me, the highlight of this album are the tracks, Paschendale, and Maiden's first acoustic track, Journeyman.  Paschendale has so much emotion with lyrics that describe the famous World War I battle. (This song ROCKED live!!)  Journeyman was incredible as a live song, and everyone played with so much passion.<br /><br />This album is great, but it is not as good as some of the classics that were released in the 80s.  The only song that I really do not like at all is track 4, which is Montsigur.  The chorus bugs me, along with how repetitive it sounds.  But, this is my only complaint with the album as a whole.  I enjoyed this album so much more because most of Maiden's live set were songs from here.  It was a beautiful experience, and one that I will never forget.  The concert was a perfect 10 out of 10 performance.  The only other concerts that I have seen that come close are Iced Earth, (Glorious Burden tour) Opeth, and Metallica.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|DONNIE DARKO has gained audience appeal through its DVD release after lukewarm responses at the cinema in 2001. <br /> <br />The film focuses on a teenage boy with psychological problems, and is told through his eyes.  The boy receives messages from an evil rabbit whom is a figment of his imagination. A number of disturbing events occur, but by the end of the film, you are left wondering what is real and what isn't. <br /> <br />Donnie Darko has some merits including interesting performances from the entire cast, and an fairly engaging storyline (but it does drag at times).  Overall, the film is over-rated and only worth seeing to try and determine why it has a cult following.  I'm still figuring out its cult following. Obviously theatre audiences from 2001 agree with me. <br /> <br />DVD SUMMARY - includes many deleted and extended scenes.  Some of these are expected to be included in the impending Director's cut due for release shortly.  Apparently this new Director's cut will improve the film's meaning.  And make it more understandable.
B000002L75|4.0|When I was 14 or 15, I got my hands on this album, and it began a definite musical growth period in me.  Before this, I was mainly a metalhead who indulged videos of freaky haired new-romantics on MTV.  I thought some of the songs were good, but come on....look at these guys!!<br /><br />Listening to the album, minus the image, and hearing Blasphemous Rumours for the first time changed it all.  I really liked the sound effects and production on this album...some interesting \\"organic\\" sounds over the clicky drum machines and synths.  The bottom line is, the songs are good, and even if you don't like this genre, you have to admit that Martin Gore is a good writer. While this band was very fashionable at the time, they weren't just about fashion.
B000000W5F|4.0|The record scores an Almost Great, lose the silly \\"Neighbors\\" and replace \\"Black Limousine\\" with a ballsier blues number and the scale would tip.  This is the last notable record of a great rock and roll band - not coincidentally it came before the massive stadium spectacles and commercialism made them a band who knew they no longer had to work to survive.  Typically, their creative output since has been an insult.     In its best moments - Tattoo You echoes the vitality of \\"Exile on Main Street\\" - the best Rolling Stones record of the 1970s, and \\"Sticky Fingers\\".  \\"Slave\\" rocks a la \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\", \\"Heaven\\" is underrated, and the rest is mostly exciting and subversive also.      I'm writing a review for this 23 year old record because listening to it for the first time in years feels damn good.    In this era when \\"Jumpin Jack Flash\\" is a marketing tool for Chevrolet and Mick Jagger is a Knight for chrissakes, there aint much but the old stuff to get yer ya yas out about.
B0001LJC2K|3.0|not bad, not brilliant - it's been done before, but this one shoots for even grander heights, deeper lows, and more overwrought angst than previous entries. if i was radiohead i'd not be too worried, they're miles beyond this now.   perhaps worth a been-there-done-that smirk or two.  Well worth the coin to see them live, however <br />
0140067477|5.0|Our \\"poised\\" and \\"civilized\\" friend Rob from the west proves a good point: give anyone an inch, and they'll walk all over you.  In this case, the inch represents the Internet and Rob's review is the heal in your face.  His tactless and myopic tirade would make anyone of sound mind want to vomit shards of glass (especially his little jewel about kung-pao chicken, which by the way ISN'T Chinese).  Way to go triumphant, two-dimensional Western ideology!  When it comes to stereotyping, it definitely takes the cake.    This book, by no means, tries to bash or villanize Wester culture.  Hoff just calls it as he sees it, which doesn't make it romanticized rants.  What this book tries to accomplish is to get the reader to acknowledge the importance of simplicity, an idea lost and distorted in our ever-growing megalomanic society.  As Mies van der Rohe put it: Less is more!  Hoff doesn't try to widen the schism between science and spirituality, but instead finds the middle ground in which both are dependent upon each other and ultimately complement one another.  Regardless of what is and what isn't on your reading list, find some room and make time for this book.  It's no Dostoevski, but I'm sure you'll find something in it that'll catch your fancy, so long as you read it with an open mind set.
B00003W8NM|4.0|For a long time I tended to steer away from this DVD when I would see it on the shelf of the video store, and I'm not quite sure why. It may have had something to do with how the film was marketed: It looked like it was about a bunch of guys beating the living crap out of each other in an effort to vent their post-modern frustrations, with some other plot line involving terrorism thrown in.<br /><br />Of course, \\"Fight Club\\" is much, MUCH more than that. Yet to say much more than that would be to, ahem, violate Rule #1 of Fight Club, which is: \\"You DON'T talk about Fight Club.\\" But now that I've decided to take the plunge and watch this film, I've been talking about \\"Fight Club\\" a whole LOT.<br /><br />Here's a film that is stylish, smart, often preposterous, and makes me want to pay a lot closer attention to the career of director David Fincher, because he's a guy with some true artistic vision. Here's a film that, after you've finished watching, makes you say to yourself, \\"Gee, now I'll have to watch it all over again!\\" Here's a film that is equal parts psychological study and anarchist's wet dream. Sensitive moviegoers ought to be warned, though: \\"Fight Club\\" is not for the faint of heart: It is a very violent and provocative adult film. It also has some of the most hysterical OFF-screen sex scenes I've ever heard! If you've been putting off seeing this film, put it off no longer.<br /><br />I'm subtracting one star, only because in our post-9/11 world, some of the subject matter seems to lose its adolescent fantasy charm.
B00000I4XR|5.0|This and the movie DUEL have been the best Steven Spielberg movies that I have ever seen! This movie is funny adventures and has alot of action!
B000286RKW|4.0|Either my copy was defective, or they really missed the boat as there were no inserts of any kind, (booklet, chapter list) included in my case.  A movie of this magnitude (#29 all time IMDb) deserves better treatment than this!
0393324818|4.0|I have little interest in baseball, but I enjoyed this book as a description of business innovation and resistance thereto.<br /><br />Lewis does a good job of reporting what the Oakland A's did better than most competitors. But I'm a bit disappointed by his half-hearted attempts to go beyond reporting the A's methods and analyze why other teams are slow to copy methods which improve scores.<br /><br />One obvious question to ask is whether team owners provide the appropriate incentives for managers to maximize the number of games won. The book hints on page 123 that the answer is no, that the A's payrolls in 2002 were further behind the those of the Yankees than in 1999. But that hint could be misleading, as it only describes an increase in the dollar difference in payrolls, and leaves unclear what happened to the ratio of the payrolls.<br /><br />One theory I came up with to explain resistance to copying the A's methods is the possibility that people view baseball as a means of measuring players skill for some broader purpose than winning games, and that winning by getting more walks seems like cheating because it doesn't reflect the abilities that baseball was designed to measure. Alas, the book provides few indications as to whether this theory explains much.<br /><br />Another theory that I suspect is more powerful is that managers who worked their way up to that job through a career as scouts adopted attitudes that implied scouting is a valuable profession, are unable to reconcile those attitudes with the new methods described in Moneyball, and prefer the worldview that says their career has been productive over a worldview which is more accurate but which implies that they have (at least at times) been ripping off their employers. Mancur Olson reported in his book Power and Prosperity that similar problems cause many private companies to categorically refuse to hire people who worked for Soviet state-run firms in the same industry.
B00005OWEG|5.0|I saw \\"Apocalypse Now\\" when it was first released in the 1970's.  I was impressed with it then, and I'm still impressed with this extraordinary movie.  But, this movie is not the Vietnam War, this is not a documentary on the Vietnam conflict. This movie is to the Vietnam War what \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" is to the Cold War and the threat of an all out Nuclear War, etc.  Both movies are noir satires, dark comedies, surrealistic treks, depicting a mad and crazy world, with laughs and jokes throughout -- in between the blood, gore, and destruction. <br /> <br />You know which movie won the Academy Award in 1979 for Best Movie of the year, and beat \\"Apocalypse Now\\"?  You guessed it, that masterpiece of cinema \\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\".  I think people will be watching \\"Apocalypse Now\\" one-hundred years from now, via some new technology, I doubt anyone will be watching \\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\"then.  \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is a cinematic masterpiece, a tour de force, just like \\"Dr Strangelove\\" IMO. <br /> <br />Buy the DVD and take the trek up the river.  You won't forget it.
B00013RC9I|5.0|I absolutely love this band however I was extremely let down with their last cd. So when I heard that they were coming out with a new one I was hesitant to get my hopes up. Well what a nice surprise! <br />Im not sure they will ever be able to top \\"Moon Safari\\" but this comes close. The music on this cd is classic Air.  <br />Any Air fan should own this cd. If your new to Air start with \\"Moon Safari\\", then I would reccomend \\"The Virgin Suicides Soundtrack\\" and then this cd.
B0001D0FTW|5.0|I thought after hearing Mandrake that (while being a very good album), Edguy was in a dangerous point of becoming stale and repetitive whithin the format and structure of their songs (Rhapsody and Stratovarius).But i am glad to say i was wrong: they evolved.Sure, i was surprised with the new found heavy aproach to the riffs, but latter i was PLEASENTLY surprised. <br />All the song are simple and powerful (don't ask Edguy to become progressive) but with enough variation to be very different from previous works.The song The Piper Never Dies, for instance, is similar to The Pharaoh (found on Mandrake), in that it uses many powerful chorus spread allong the way, but the melodies and riffs are unique to this song and do not copy those found in the latter. <br />The chorus in all of the songs simply soars and strikes a deeply emotional melodic chord. <br />Bottom line: if you like Edguy, this is a sure and very solid buy.If you are yet to discover them, start with Theater of Salvation and then buy this Hellfire Club and then become part of the Savage Union! <br />
0763624292|5.0|We bought this on a driving trip in Maine this summer and our 4 year old just loved it.  Still does now home in CA!  He memorized the story and loves to repeat the story.  Also they have various word and other games related to the story.  You won't regret buying it!
B000000H66|5.0|Can those qualities merge in an album? on individual songs, even? <br />YES.How? Holy cow, don`t ask me!Chuck thought that he could pull it off and he did it! He isolated the melodic factor used randomly in the masterpiece Individual Thought Patterns and made it the dominant factor on Symbolic.But without losing any of the newfound complexity in his music.Sure, in this album you won`t find the Excellent and weirds contributions from Steve DiGiorgio of the past effort and the flasy Andy LaRoque but the rest is still breathtaking.If you are EXTREMELY demanding, you could say that this is weaker than Individual, but if you are like me and can nevertheless appreciate the beauty and complex stuff that are here in huge amounts, you will find this work just as good. <br />S**t! You may even find every other music by other bands lame and powerless, let alone uninspired! <br />
B000002LGQ|4.0|Well I bought this album and loved it.  As always Madonna has an original sound on this particular album.  Many of these songs do seem to have a contemporary/gospel influence to them, but that doesn't mean it isn't great.  I really love this album.  I will rate the songs: <br />1.  Like a Prayer (if not the best on the album) 5/5 <br />2.  Express Yourself (good dance song) 4/5 <br />3.  Lovesong (duet with Prince!!!) 4/5 <br />4.  Till Death Do us part (great 80's dance sound to it) 5/5 <br />5.  Promise to try  (doesn't fit) 2/5 <br />6.  Cherish (love it!)5/5 <br />7.  Dear Jessie (cheesey and out of place) 2/5 <br />8.  Oh Father (great powerful ballad) 5/5 <br />9.  Keep it together (dance song, gets old) 3/5 <br />10.  Spanish eyes (this song is very catchy) 5/5 <br />11.  Act of contrition (more of an outro, interesting) 3/5 <br /> <br />Overall 43/55
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I love this cd!  That should be all I have to say... LOVE IT!  I had the pleasure of meeting Sarah McLachlan in person at a private performance she did in Seattle... Wow, this woman is extremely talented!  She sounds so beautiful in person as well as on the cd.  I love this cd when I'm feeling creative or I need some inspiration.. She is a true artist of our time!  WOW!
B00000K31Q|3.0|Whatever happened to Julia Stiles?  When this movie came out, she and Kirsten Dunst were neck and neck for IT GIRL of Hollywood, and for awhile one would rise up and the other fall, but they had pretty much an even spread.  But now, when I watch TEN THINGS her greatest moment in films, she looks dowdy and the outfits they put her in look horrid.  Meanwhile Dunst goes from good to better roles.  Someone should tell Julia Stiles that with a big face like hers, bangs are better.  And whatever happened to Heath Ledger?  At the time this movie was released, he looked like the next big thing, with a big part in THE PATRIOT, etc, and a bright future.  Now it's like, Heath who?  And starring in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is really going to help his career.<br /><br />Well, all in all, now that THE O C is on TV, why even watch TEN THINGS again?  It's almost the same show, and the girl who plays Bianca here might as well be rehearsing for the part of Summer, and her boyfriend Joey uses the same coy quips as Seth Cohen.  The OC's leads are more attractive than STILES and LEDGER and all in all, it's a more satisfying experience all the way around and at least SUMMER never wore a prom dress as hideous as the one poor BIANCA has to appear in.<br /><br />Years later as I re-read some of my old reviews, I'm mortified by the things I wrote about this film!  Kirsten Dunst doesn't seem like the IT Girl any more than poor Julia Stiles.  Time passes so quickly when you're young and incandescent and the camera's trained its eye on you.  Since I wrote the above, The O.C. came and went, and so did Heath, although he did make his comeback right in a big way before his terrible death by misadventure.  And BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was a great part for him and he handled it beautifully.  So I was wrong everywhere.  And now that he is gone he can watch his performance in this film, 10 Things I Hate About You, from different perspectives, and mourn all the promise shown that we are now bereft of.
B000089RVX|4.0|Evanesence is such an amazing band!  They have combined the cool calming tones of such artists as Enya, or Sarah McLachlan, and combined it with a hip twist of Limp bizcuit, and Tool... They married the two genres beautifully to create something entirely new and original.  Fallen expresses so many emotions it's nearly overwhelming.  I love this cd because I can honestly say that I enjoyed all of the tracks, there was not one more interesting than another, I love that kind of uniform reflection in a cd, or anything for that matter.  This album gave me goosebumps it was so good... give it a shot!
6305910340|5.0|One of the deciding factors I use to determine whether or not I will purchase a DVD is, \\"How many times will I want to see this film?\\"  Well, as far as this DVD is concerned I'm nearing the double-digits in viewings.  This is essentially a Family Film with a great cast of actors such as Laurence Fishburn, Joan Allen, Joe Mantegna, Ben Kingsley, David Paymer, William H. Macy, and a small role by the then virtually unknown Laura Linney.  After that, there are some fine scenes filled with some excellent child acting.  I happen to think any film with good child acting is worth seeing, they are so rare.  The story is well-written and ranges in emotion from humor to borderline outrage and deep-seeded disappointment.  This film actually reminds me of \\"The Color of Money\\" directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Tom Cruise and Paul Newman.  I got a similar buzz from both films.  After I watch \\"The Color of Money\\" I feel an unbridled desire to play pool.  After I watch \\"Searching for Bobby Fischer\\" I need to break out my chess board or play on my chess program.  There is even a shot taken directly from \\"The Color of Money\\" that is used here.  In \\"The Color of Money\\" there is a great camera shot of a huge room that starts with a shot of the ceiling and gradually pans downward to reveal an empty hall with about twenty pool tables set up for play.  In \\"Searching for Bobby Fischer\\" there is a sweeping camera shot that begins with a dark shot of a hallway ceiling then floats through an archway into a huge, empty hall filled with dozens of chess boards ready for play.  This film did get a single Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography, and with shots like those it is easy to see why.  This is a very solid purchase for anyone, chess fans or no.  There are a couple of scenes that bend towards the over-dramatic for the sense of keeping the story thrilling.  Such as the final chess match, which is not what really happened, but it makes for a more entertaining scene.  I know this because the real Josh Waitzkin helped design my chess program Chessmaster 9000 and his championship games are all listed therein.  Minor discrepancies aside, everything about this film is first-rate and altogether superb.  Thank you.

They have combined the cool calming tones of such artists as Enya, or Sarah McLachlan, and combined it with a hip twist of Limp bizcuit, and Tool... They married the two genres beautifully to create something entirely new and original.  Fallen expresses so many emotions it's nearly overwhelming.  I love this cd because I can honestly say that I enjoyed all of the tracks, there was not one more interesting than another, I love that kind of uniform reflection in a cd, or anything for that matter.  This album gave me goosebumps it was so good... give it a shot!

0385659806|3.0|Three points for originality. It seems a bit much, but i am also taking into account some of the complicated maths the author did.<br />There is really nothing wrong with this book. If we are to take the puritanist view that literature should only reflect real life than this book would be wonderful. It reflects (as well as we can know) the life of an autistic boy.<br />But there is nothing really new in it. It has no magic and would seem to appeal more to somebody who gets a distinct amount of pleasure from reading how thier stocks are doing (not that there is anything really wrong with that, different strokes after all).<br />I saw nothing new in it, and nothing that provoked anything new in me. I feel the same as i did before reading it. I find it hard to compare even with the all time childrens classic, &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. That book touched me in special ways.<br />Now, as a disclaimer i am not poo-pooing this book. It is a fine piece of work. But it is important to remember what it is not when reading it. Enjoy it for what it is, which is a novel looking at the way an autistic boy sees the world, and the difficulties that his family has in coping.
B0002I831S|4.0|I haven't seen this set yet, but I would have given this five stars if the shows had been presented in production order (ala the previous releases) rather than broadcast order, since the broadcast order makes little sense, IMHO (and unlike some other shows like \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" and even \\"M*A*S*H,\\" which produced some shows out of order deliberately knowing the broadcast order would be correct).<br /><br />And by the way, to further correct a previous reviewer, despite the disclaimer on the package the original DVD release of \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\" featured the correct music with \\"Goodnight, Sweetheart.\\"  What I would like to know about this set is if Paramount fixed the opening credits music--the wrong version was used on several of the early episodes of the original DVD release.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Easily my favourite film of the year - that groggy, travel-sick sense of dislocation-through-travel is captured to perfection in this. There are too many lovely moments and gorgeous touches to recount in this clever, astute and observant film. The whole cast is superb, but Bill Murray still manages to steal the film. It's his best since Groundhog Day and may he please make many more. A near-perfect movie well worth owning as it is worth re-watching.  <br />
B00005JNEI|3.0|If you begin this film with the undisputed knowledge that Michael Moore has an agenda, and that agenda is hating Bush and getting him out, then you should be prepped to watch this with the appropriate amount of judgement necessary to weigh the facts/opinions he lays out. <br /> <br />A film with an unapoloagetic agenda, I do have to appreciate.  Moore carefully lays out what appears to be very shady goings on in the post 9/11 America, and the Bush administration in general.  I will say that I found some of his arguments and fact gathering very intriquing.  Ya gotta give the man credit for dogged research. <br /> <br />That being said, he is very selective about which facts he reveals, and how he lights them.  For instance...one segment has him talking to Secret Service agents guarding the Saudi embassy.  It would appear that the Saudi's are given special treatment by the secret service.  However...Moore fails to mention that ALL foreign embassies have assigned Secret Service agents.  There are several instances of selective fact statement, so I think it's important to remember that some of his more astounding 'black/white' angles do have decided shades of gray. <br /> <br />What I appreciate about this film, and why I do recommend it, is because it sparked me to do my own fact finding and come to my own conclusion about the arguments displayed in the film.  It made me think, and actually motivated me to find out more about my government, and to help educate myself on my choice for president.  It's a welcome change when a film spurs action, and for that reason, I can recommend this...as long as one doesn't make the mistake of making Michael Moore's Bush administration one's own.
0765301598|1.0|The only good thing about this book is it represents the last in the trilogy. Consistent with the other two in the series, this one is plain awful. I found the House trilogy silly but entertaining. The House trilogy was worth reading for the fun of visiting familiar characters again; even if the writing was weak. The legends trilogy is so bad, it could have been written by teenagers. I also found the short, meaningless chapters quite distracting. It is as if the story threads were so thin, they could only be explored a few paparagraphs at a time before turning to another thread. The trilogy could have easily been condensed into a single novel. Forget about a comparison with the original Dune books, these books are bad as standalones. The characters are one-dimensional without depth and the plot is as predictable as a cheap B-movie. <br /> <br />I hope they make a better effort if they're going to write the sequel to Chapterhouse. I would hate to see the cliffhanger in Chapterhouse ruined because they believe their readers have the attention span of 10-year olds.
B0002234LS|4.0|Secret Window is a film based on a Stephen King Short Story Secret Window, Secret Garden.  Originally, I had read the short story several years ago and was apprehensive about seeing the film, because my memory of the short story was that the twist ending was somewhat difficult to comprehend.<br /><br />However, seeing this adaptation of it was a godsend in helping me appreciate a really good story.  Depp is perfectly cast as the Author who is being terrorized by a man known only as John Shooter, who accuses Depp of Plaigerizing.  Meanwhile, Rainey is dealing with his own demons as well as he works through a divorce he didn't want.  Depp proves he is one of our most prized acting resources as he tries to stay one step ahead of the madman.<br /><br />However, I would add that I found reading the short story with this book was a great help.  The film stayed true to the creepy ending, and actually helped clear some of my confusion regarding the original reading.  And the filmmakers wisely don't veer too far off course in translating this sad tale of lonliness to the screen.<br /><br />Definitely a great buy if you like thrillers, King, or Depp.
B000002OZY|5.0|It goes without saying that Pete Townshend and the Who made in TOMMY an album full of excellent songwriting and productions. I'm particularly fond of the use of acoustic guitar (instead of strings) as the dominating instrument bridging the elements together.    However, the thing that always gets me about TOMMY is how insightful the young Pete Townshend was in the telling of Tommy's tale. Tommy witnesses an event that both scares him and also brings him disillusionment towards adult figures. Psychologically Tommy shuts himself off from the outside world. I don't know how Townshend understood this concept so clearly at such a young age, but he captured one of the most subtle ideas in a way that continues to have real relevance today. There isn't a person alive that hasn't become deaf, dumb and blind to their own painful experiences as a safety mechanism... even if only a small situation that is too painful to face, we all shut down at times, and the Tommy character is an amazing parable for everyday life. Sadly, Tommy also seems to be a parallel for Townshend's own haunted childhood (which included molestation and abuse).    There are plenty of other worthy musical & thematic insights that are encompassed on this album, and many reviewers have already mentioned these. It just goes to show that TOMMY has so much going for it, in terms of lasting appeal and real depth. Don't let pessemistic journalists ruin it for you... TOMMY is an excellent album.
0553382179|3.0|The concept of cleaning and clutter from Parris Island, NC takes the idea of the clean room to its uncommon conclusion - being \\"squared away.\\" Unfortunately, for many women, the idea of being the \\"clean up crew\\" for Marines who tend to dump that task upon unwitting wives to maintain that standard is often unwelcome and more along the lines of maid than house-WIFE. When women are made the chief Squared away keeper, most rebel from early training when their mothers may have required clean rooms. To graduate to the plain or domain of the military standard of being \\"squared away\\" is neither an easy task nor one that most embrace throughout their lives. The solution might exist in the possibility of \\"debriefing\\" men when they leave the military that civilian life will likely not provide the strict lines of cleanliness and de-clutter that was made a part of their lives in the military over which they had full control because they were forced to do it themselves. However clean and clutterless women may have the tendency to be, transferring the impetus from the Corp to their wives is a condition most women are not able to make even if they wanted to, which most don't. The Corp takes cleanliness and clutterless status to an artform that even Howard Hughes, himself, would appreciate. Most women don't share that fetish, however, with Howard, and don't expect to with their husbands.
0060920084|3.0|That old saw, \\"you can never go home\\" has rarely been more in evidence than in this book by then-expatriate Bryson. Having lived England for over a decade, he decides to return to his native Iowa and embark on a hazily conceived cross-country road trip. The \\"road trip\\" is a distinctly American invention, born of the combination of affluence, the interstate highway system, and the size of America. It's usually invoked as a framework on which to build a tale of discovery, and here Bryson intends to rediscover and ostensibly celebrate small-town America. Touching base in Des Moines to see his mother, he sets out to locate a real-life version of the perfect movie-set small towns of his childhood films.<br /><br />He begins the trip with frequent stories about his now-dead father, who would drag the family on horrendous family vacations each summer. Unfortunately, his father merely comes across as a cliche bumbling father, always getting lost, too proud to ask for directions, stingy, and choleric toward the equally cliche kids in the back seat. Thankfully as Bryson moves outside of the zone of his childhood vacations, stories of his father disappear. This allows the meat of the book to emerge&oacute;small town America. And in Bryson's eyes, it's not a pretty scene. It doesn't take long for him to realize that chain stores have spread their tentacles across the land and places that might have once have character are now becoming anonymous assemblages of strip malls and parking lots. Because Bryson's been overseas, he assumes a stunned \\"what happened!?\\" attitude to this transformation. What happened is the inexorable intersection of a capitalist economy with a consumer society, where chain operations enjoy the economies scale that allow them to offer the cheapest prices to the consumer, who naturally responds. Bryson (rightfully) rails against the loss of character and individuality this engenders in communities across the country. Of course, this is a trend that has only increased in the fifteen years since the book first appeared, and there's little end in sight.<br /><br />To be sure, Bryson's account is not meant to be a fair-minded, clinical observation. Clearly intended for a British audience, Bryson is always keen to make a broad generalization, cheap joke, snide jibe, or catty comment about what and who he encounters. While this is sometimes entertaining, it often crosses into sheer mean-spiritedness. A particular target of his is the overweight, which he seems to believe is a uniquely American phenomenon&oacute;rich, when you see statistics suggesting that the British are on their way to passing Americans in the obesity stakes. In any event, there's lots of haranguing about fast food, bad food, scummy hotels, lame tourist traps, and the interchangeability of so many small towns. Eventually, he realizes that the perfect town doesn't exist (although there are three or four he ends up really liking), and he'll have to piece it together in his head from the standout parts of different places.<br /><br />The 14,000 mile, 38 state (he doesn't get to the deep south, the Pacific Northwest, or the upper northeast) trip isn't very useful per se. Anyone who knows nothing about the backroads of America is going to be horrified, anyone who has a bad opinion about the backroads of America will find plenty of confirmation, and anyone who likes the backroads of America (or lives there) will probably be infuriated. Ultimately, much of the book has a kind of distasteful elitist tone to it, when Bryson does stumble across something he likes, it's treated as an unexpected boon that's all the more shocking for being in the hinterland. I've read almost every one of his other books, and for the most part, greatly enjoyed them, but this isn't of nearly the same quality.ased in the fifteen years since the book first appeared, and there's little end in sight.  <br /> <br />To be sure, Bryson's account is not meant to be a fair-minded, clinical observation.

B000000OQF|5.0|This is without a doubt the best album of all time.  No other band can even come close to this album.
B00005JN0A|3.0|Teen films are in a realm of there very own, and this one just doesn't hold up compared to other teen comedies or just comedies in general. At about 85 minutes, Eurotrip moves along quickly using the typical tag lines for maximum laughs, though I didn't laugh much in throughout this film. The things the filmmakers obviously wanted to be funny just didn't work out, some of the crude jokes reminded me of those really bad teen TV shows that use laugh tracks to compensate for an actual audience not laughing at all. <br /> <br />The movie is about a recent high school graduate named Scott (his look and voice bear striking resemblance to Brad Pitt), whose girlfriend dumps him in the beginning because he's too predictable. At an after-grad party, he sees his girlfriend making out with the lead singer of a band played by Matt Damon, which is actually pretty funny especially since Damon has a spike in his chin and attempts to look hardcore. Scott has an internet penpal named Mike, and after a hard night drinking, Scott basically tells Mike to buzz off and never come to America. The next day Scott finds out that Mike is actually pronounced Mee-Ka, a popular German GIRLS name. So he decides he loves her and goes to Europe to apologize and profess his love. <br /> <br />The movie is so hair-brained I could hardly stand it. About twenty minutes in, I wanted it to be over. I did enjoy the appearance of Fred Armison (of Saturday Night Live) who plays a goofy, raunchy Italian guy. A couple things were funny, most were not. I'm sure kids still in high school would enjoy this film, but my advice is to instead check out other teen comedies like Sixteen Candles or American Pie or even Road Trip.

B00003CXCT|5.0|I have to say I totally understand this debate over the altering of NEW versions of the Star Wars Trilogy (episodes 4, 5 and 6). I am truly looking forward to these films in their new versions but I sympathize with those who want their films untouched as they first viewed them. Perhaps in my mind, these may be some of the very FEW films ever made which could stand the updating and restoration... I say that for a few reasons. First of all, the Star Wars films in question depended so greatly on the prequels that have been made in the years since.... also they depend on their \\"look\\", and seen compared to episodes 1 and 2.. and probably the upcoming episode 3, they may not look so great to future Star Wars fans who will instead see them IN ORDER, which most of us DID NOT. To my thinking, if it these were not revamped, they would look weaker and more primitive to future generations caught up with the clarity and tone of the first 3 films.     I TOTALLY agree that to change details of the story might not be wise, and I am not aware to what degree this will be done except for rumour... we all need to actually see them to make a judgement call for how each of us feels about the changes... but if it's simply a matter of cleaning up the special effects (like removing the gray boxes from the spacecraft against the black skies) and making Yoda look more like a living being and not a \\"Muppet\\" I am all for it.     ARTISTS ALTERING THEIR WORKS:   Is it okay for an artist to change his works? Some say NO. Yet in history, classical composers such as Bach, Bruckner, Debussy and many more, often had \\"versions\\" or new \\"editions\\" to change orchestration, orders of movements and even which instrument would take the lead in a concerto. Every art scholar knows that paintings are often painted and repainted by their original creators and sometimes overpainted by other painters many years later. The museums are filled with works that have had faces painted out, figures added, coats of arms changed or painted out and fig leaves added to male nudes. There are even paintings that are painted over other paintings that were already completed. This is more common in art history that you think. Many Italian and Dutch paintings have gone through extensive realtering. Sometimes even an artist would sign his name to another mans painting.... some works by Rembrandt were actually painted by others in his studio. He knew the painting would sell better with his name on it.     These days, many a brand new Harley Davidson with state of the art design is bought by an owner only to be remodelled into a custom chopper to the raves of the magazines and buyers .... and that logic applies to cars, great buildings and other things.     The REAL question is SHOULD motion picture films be altered? My general answer is probably \\"NO\\"... I believe in cleaning them, fixing badly done special effects, reprinting from the original negative, etc... if it does not ruin the integrity and look of the original (just as art museums routinely \\"restore\\" great paintings without a fuss from anyone).... but on the question of adding scenes and altering storylines... that is a trickier question. STAR WARS COULD be the exception for the above reasons and since it is their creator who is doing it. It is well known over the years, he has expended on his original 1977 ideas on these sagas and he wants to \\"right\\" that. This vision may conflict with OUR individual ideas of what these films may mean to us... but since when do individuals agree on what is \\"right\\" or lacking in any given film? I know many a Star Wars fan who hated the introduction of \\"Jar Jar Binks\\", or did not care for other aspects of one of the films upon release. So what is \\"right\\" for \\"Star Wars\\" remains the discretion of Mr. Lucas... the creator of these \\"worlds\\" we have been allowed to visit... and in 1977 he set to film a world he wanted to share with us and now, 30 years later, he wants to evolve that world for generations tobe born long after we are gone while he still can.     I think we need to see what the man will give us in this new set and then judge if it is for us or not. For what it's worth, I DO believe the original theatrical release should be available to those who want them... and the films are so popular, I think both the new versions and the original versions in release will be profitable for 20th Century Fox to have on the market.
0553212737|3.0|Had this story been written in a more contemporary style, my review would have been totally favorable. I found the story to be quite sweet, with great characters and a wholesome storyline.  <br />Unfortunately, this particular style of writing for me, as a fourteen year old, was a tad daunting. I found it slow, with way too many words and descriptions. I found myself often wishing she would just get to the point.I would have awarded more stars if it wasn't so difficult for me to get through.
B000022TSW|4.0|This movie really should appeal to a small subgroup - mature enough to appreciate the rare wisdom in much of its biting satire, but immature enough to also enjoy the coarse, twisted humor. I fit into this subgroup, but I'm not particularly proud of that, come to think of it. <br /> <br />It was a good movie, too bad it attracts so many kids who only get half the jokes in it. This movie, along with most South Park episodes, ridicules hypocricy, conformism, faith, and prudishness. It's the little things in the movie that make the comedy - e.g. a five second clip of Terrance & Phillip that illustrates the banality of rap music, the inspired insanity of casting Saddam as Satan's lover with a fondness for rubber phalluses, the reference to \\"A Clockwork Orange\\". The musical numbers were quite good, in that they were catchy and generally well done. A few things fell flat - I think that \\"the mole\\" and his god-cursing was simply there to make the audience uncomfortable - and I say that as a proud atheist; the ending didn't provide sufficient dramatic resolution. <br /> <br />The major negative is that this movie, like most South Park episodes only ridicules, but does not provide positives. They tear down the bad, but project no vision of a hero. Many people cannot bear sick humor,and this movie has it in spades. I never outgrew flatulence jokes, but many have. This isn't a movie I'd recommend watching with loved ones. <br /> <br />
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|The whole reason I bought D12 World is because I heard My Band on the radio, and it had Eminem in it. I later heard Git Up and thought it was a really cool song, as well. So, I decided to go buy the CD. I usually love most of Eminem's songs, and this CD doesn't disappoint me either, even though it's not just him. I think the others in D12 help make these songs what they are--awesome. I especially love How Come; it's very moving and creative the way they go back and forth--telling two sides of the story.  <br /> <br />Other songs, such as Just Like U, U R the One, and Get My Gun are quite funny, and though I think Eminem is very prominent in it, that's the reason I wanted the CD. The group is hard-edged, and they all work well together, their voices, flow, rhythems--the whole nine yards. I think most fans would enjoy this CD. 5 stars.

B0000630BT|4.0|Well, I find this album to be a lot of fun, but I can only recommend it with some reservations. Simply put, lots of younger metal fans who were, like myself, introduced to the genre through more extreme and serious minded styles will probably have a tough time getting in to this as they may simply find it too cheesy for their tastes. This album is quite cheesy, no doubt about it, with some of the most embarrassing lyrics I've ever heard on a metal album. This bothered me a bit at first, and now I don't really care, but some people may not get over this so readily.(Not to say that black/death/thrash aren't ever overdone, they often are, but in a different way from this album)<br /><br />This is very straightforward stuff. It's not real big on major tempo or tonal changes, with every track other than Night Crawler and A Touch of Evil being a straightforward rocker. Not the most sophisticated album in the world, but this style definitely has it's value, and Priest does it well.(Not to say it's easy to play, but conceptually and structurally it's generally not very complicated or adventurous.) Tipton and Downing are fabulous lead guitarists. When it comes to pure, shredding leads they are some of the very best in the business. However, they're even better when they slow down a bit and get more emotional, most notably on A Touch of Evil. Too bad they don't do so a little bit more, but I suppose it wouldn't really fit this album very well, for the most part. Rhythm guitar is less impressive but still good. As this is speed metal the emphasis is less on varied memorable and crunching riffs and more on simply driving and melodic ones, and they do this very well.(I just happen to find this riff style less intriguing than what you find in most other subgenres) The drumming is thunderously loud, particularly the snare drum, but no in an obnoxious way like on lots of lousy European power metal. Quite a bit of the double bass too, a very powerful and energetic drum performance all around. Halford is an extremely impressive singer, and, more significantly, they consistently write catchy vocal lines and great chorus'. In short, this album has lots of energy and is very memorable in is just a lot of fun. That's enough for me.<br /><br />It's hard to pick out stand out tracks, as it is both quite very consistent and not highly varied. The title track is great, naturally. Lotsa driving intensity and some particularly noteworthy lead work. Hell Patrol is perhaps the catchiest song on the album. Probably my favorite rocker. Between the Hammer and the Anvil is another great rocker, with a bit more atmosphere and the best leadwork on the album, aside from A Touch of Evil. Speaking of which, it's an atmospheric, somewhat balladish song, but it still rocks hard, and Halford gives his best vocal performance. I particularly like the bridge. The only notably weaker part is Night Crawler. The chorus is still cool, but the attempts at atmosphere largely fail on that one.<br /><br />Well thats about it. Good album.e all around.

B00005JLWN|4.0|(Warning: Some spoilers ahead) <br /> <br />The cover of the Equilibrium DVD has a quote that says `Forget The Matrix!'. To be honest, I felt that putting that on the cover might actually backfire. Diehard fans of the Matrix might scoff at seeing Equilibrium because of that quote, thinking there is no way the lower budget Equilibrium could beat it. Others might come in with unrealistically high expectations for the movie, expecting over-the-top special effects, and will probably come away disappointed. Frankly I think that's too bad, because Equilibrium is a great movie in its own right with an original and engrossing story, as well as some pretty darn cool fight scenes. <br /> <br />Equilibrium takes place in a time in which World War III has taken place, and humanity was almost destroyed because of it. Everyone knew that mankind could not survive a fourth war, and so a radical solution was conceived. Since wars were caused by emotional arrogance and intolerance, all emotions should be suppressed to prevent any future conflict. As such everyone one in Equilibrium's world is required by law to take doses of a drug called Prozium every day to suppress their emotions. This law is ruthlessly enforced by a group known as the `Clerics', who hunt down anybody who commits a `sense offense'. The story of Equilibrium revolves around a Cleric named John Preston who accidentally misses a dose of Prozium, and starts being able to feel emotions. John is eventually sent to capture a group of rebels opposed to the current government, but joins them instead. <br /> <br />Many people who have criticized this movie have felt that Equilibrium's atmosphere and characters were too cold. My question to them would be, where have you been the entire movie? The society that was presented in this movie is supposed to be devoid of emotions, so you wouldn't expect people to be acting happy (or angry, or any other observable emotion). Personally I think all the actors in the movie did a great job, with the stand out one being Christian Bale as John Preston. From his uncaring persona at the start of the movie, to when he starts to first feel emotions, to his smiling at the very end of the movie, I could feel what his character was going through. <br /> <br />So how about the film's action sequences? Unlike The Matrix, Equilibrium uses very little computer enhancements or `wire-fu' techniques, but they look just as well done. There's sword fighting, guns ablazing, and bone-snapping martial arts (therefore a little bit of something for everybody). Although admittedly there was one scene towards the end of Equilibrium that seemed vaguely similar to The Matrix's `lobby' fight scene. However, this scene was more of an homage if anything, since it is done and choreographed quite differently. <br /> <br />It's a shame that Equilibrium did so poorly in the theatres, and that it did not get a better promotional boost. Personally I wouldn't have even seen this movie if it was not given two thumbs up on Ebert & Roeper's TV show. Now that Equilibrium is out on video and DVD, this is as good a time as any to go see this movie. With an underlying message about freedom, great acting, and awesome action, what's not to like about it? Forget about the negative comments made by the critics. Go see this movie and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />I give this film a solid 8 out of 10!
B00026W82U|4.0|In a day and age where musical artists come and go and pop acts are a dime-a-dozen, Kings of Convenience are a refreshing change of pace.<br /><br />Beautifully minimal without the copious electronics, overdubbing, and processing that most music goes through these days, it's nice to hear a couple guys and a guitar making great music.<br /><br />When I first heard them, I immediately though of Simon and Garfunkle in terms of their asthetic and songwriting similarities. These guys have a little more pop sensibility about them, as witnessed in tracks like \\"Sorry or Please\\", \\"Love It No Big Truth\\", and \\"I'd Rather Dance With You.\\"<br /><br />Like most great music I come across, I discovered these guys purely by accident. I found a remix of one of their tracks which of course lead me to check out the band's original work. I was immediately impressed with their lyrical, vocal, and musical sensibilities and have been listening to this album non-stop for days.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this disc 4 stars was because there are 2-3 tracks that sound too similar to one another.<br /><br />Check out the samples and you'll quickly see what a refreshing change of pace Kings of Convenience are. They come highly recommended.
B00003CXTG|3.0|**Warning: A few spoilers** <br /> <br />When I saw the first trailer for Pearl Harbor back in late 2000, I thought that it looked damn cool, and it would be one of the movies that I planned to see in the summer of 2001. But, for some reason (I forget exactly why), I never saw it when it was out in theatres. I also never bothered to rent it when it came out on Video/DVD. I guess this is due in part to many of my friends saying it was a bad movie, although a few did say they liked it. I swore that one of these days I would see Pearl Harbor, and decide for myself whether it deserved all of its negative/positive reviews. Now, three years after it was released I caught it on cable TV while flipping through the channels. And what did I think of it? Pearl Harbor sacrifices strong character development for special effects, and becomes a movie that is at best average. <br /> <br />Let me start off by talking about the high points of the movie, the battle scenes. The computer animated fighter planes were well done, and seeing waves of Japanese Zero fighters flying over Pearl Harbor was just plain cool. The attack on Pearl Harbor, as depicted by the movie, is chock full of explosions, guns ablazing, and well-choreographed dogfights. It's the only sequence in the movie that held my attention for any length of time, but I would expect no less from a director like Michael Bay. His resume of movies makes him well suited to vividly rendering tremendous scenes of carnage. Yet, at the same time as I thought how cool the special effects were, I realized that this was a weakness too. <br /> <br />The battle scenes in this movie, specifically the Pearl Harbor attack, are not something that should make us say \\"Yo! That's so cool how the Arizona blew up!\\" These battle scenes should make us focus on how horrible the attack was, and it hindsight, the attack on Pearl Harbor in this movie looked more like a scene from Independence Day, but replaces the alien and jet fighters with World War II era craft. The American planes unrealistically fly only a few feet above the ground, while strafing the Japanese fighters. I couldn't help but feel that this was dishonoring the memory of those who died in the attack. <br /> <br />The characters seemed more like a second thought in this movie, taking a back seat to the battle scenes. The dialogue was often very corny, and the acting itself was pretty stilted on the whole. I've lost count as to how many times Capt. Rafe McCawley (played by Ben Affleck) tells Nurse Evelyn Johnson (played by Kate Beckinsale) she's so beautiful. One would think she would get the point after the first five times. Their romance (and her eventual romance to Josh Harnett's character) looks too forced, as if they are supposed to fall in love simply to advance the plot and nothing else. This movie also, prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, attempts to sledgehammer the point that you are supposed to feel sorry for all the soldiers and civilians. They show tons of scenes of giggling young women, happy-go-lucky men having a beer, and several cheap love scenes. What I don't think director Michael Bay realizes is that since we know about the tragedy to come, there is no need to take such a heavy-handed and redundant approach. Bay appears to think otherwise, and has to constantly reinforce the idea that \\"you must feel sorry for these people.\\" <br /> <br />Lastly, there are a couple scenes in Pearl Harbor that I have to talk about. The first is the scene during the attack when Capt. Danny Walker (Josh Harnett's character) radios that \\"I think World War II just started.\\" When he said that my eyebrows were drawn together, and my hands clenched into a fist. World War II did not start at Pearl Harbor! Countries like Britain, France, and Canada were fighting the Nazis, and the Chinese were fighting the Japanese before Pearl Harbor happened. <br /> <br />The second scene would be during the Jimmy Doolittle raid on a Japanese industrial area. One thing that I (and other critics) noticed was that there were very few Japanese civilians that could be seen in the area. And once the bombs dropped, we saw buildings being blown up, but no screaming Japanese civilians. This is probably because the filmmakers did not want to put too much of a damper on the movie, by making the audience realize that Americans bombed civilians too. <br /> <br />I will admit that I did feel a LITTLE sadness when everybody thought Affleck's character died in Europe, and when Harnett's character died at the end. Other than that, Pearl Harbor the movie is entirely forgettable. My recommendation is that if you want to see a war movie with great drama (and no cheesy love story), coupled with great action scenes, go see Saving Private Ryan (1998). If you want to see a more historically accurate depiction of the Pearl Harbor attack that has little cheesy dialogue, and shows what happened on both sides, go see Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970). Tora! Tora! Tora! has special effects that still hold up even today despite its age, and in my opinion, is a much better film than this 21st century Pearl Harbor movie. <br /> <br />I give Pearl Harbor movie a 6 out of 10.

B00005JN2X|4.0|**Warning: Spoilers ahead** <br /> <br />This movie surprised me. I mean it REALLY surprised me. I didn't know what to expect from this movie. Collateral shows Tom Cruise in what I believe is his first `bad guy' role and Jamie Foxx in one of his few non-comedy roles. But with its tight writing and direction, and great performances by all actors involved, Collateral is without a doubt one of the best movies of this summer, and the surprise sleeper hit of the year.  <br /> <br />The story of Collateral revolves around an assassin named Vincent (played by Cruise) who commandeers a taxi operated by Max (played by Foxx). Vincent forces Max at gunpoint to assist him in assassinating five individuals on his hit list. However, this seemingly simple premise belies an incredibly strong story. If you want non-stop balls-to-walls action, and/or have no patience for movies that `have a lot of talking' then look somewhere else. While there are several scenes of gunplay, the core of this movie deals with the interaction between Vincent and Max. <br /> <br />It is true that, like in most movies, Collateral's most interesting character is the villain. Cruise's portrayal of the character is amazing. As Vincent, Cruise delivers his lines with such ease and confidence, that it's more than worthy of Oscar consideration. Vincent is a person who his incredibly calm considering the profession that he's in. He is also extremely resourceful, as shown when he pretends to be a lawyer telling off Max's boss when he (the boss) wants to take any damages done to the taxi out of Max's paycheck. Vincent also always has something sarcastic (and often funny) say to Max when he begins to criticize what Vincent has done. After Vincent kills of the first person on his list, Max asks why he would kill his victim after only just meeting him. To that, Vincent replies, `What? I should only kill people after I get to know them?'. Vincent then asks Max whether he heard about Rwanda. He goes on to tell Max thousands of people died yet `Did you join Amnesty International, Oxfam, Save the Whales, Greenpeace, or something? No. I off one fat Angelino and you throw a hissy fit.'  <br /> <br />Max himself is also an interesting character, and is surprisingly well-played by Jamie Foxx. He tells people who get in his cab about his intentions to own a limo service and drive around famous people, yet at the same time he projects a sense that this is more of a dream than a real plan, and you feel sorry for him. His character is also one that continuously changes throughout the movie. After the first killing, Max gets scared and has no idea how to deal with Vincent. But as soon as he sees an opening, Max jumps on the opportunity to destroy Vincent's suitcase with his work inside. And when Max has to confront a powerful drug lord while posing as Vincent, he has to force himself to become as cool and collected as Vincent himself. <br /> <br />An interesting thing to note about this movie is, just like Michael Man's other movie Heat, Collateral likes to use a lot of the wide shots of the background. In Heat this was used to good effect to give that movie a more `epic' experience. In Collateral, this wide shot technique is used to give the viewer to stronger `feel' for the city of Los Angeles, as a bustling, busy, and warm (in terms of temperature) metropolis. <br /> <br />If Cruise and Foxx continue to make performances like that in Collateral, I wouldn't be surprised if one day they get an academy award. Hell it's entirely possible for them to get nominated for their roles in this movie. With so many special effect blockbusters out there this summer, Collateral bucks the trend by providing a movie that focuses on strong characters and dialogue, and a few unexpected twists, rather than relying on huge explosions. Collateral is one of the MUST SEE movies of this summer, so don't deprive yourself by not checking it out. <br /> <br />I give Collateral a rock-solid 8 out of 10!
B0002BO0AS|5.0|this has to be my metal-core album of the year, i dont know if anything else thats coming out can beat it...maybe lamb of gods new relase ashes of the wake when it comes out, but wow.....this band and album are amazing.....im glad tehy went more metal with this album, but still kept the breakdowns, they add so much more to the songs. there isnt one \\"bad\\" track on here, but of course, i have my faves.....1, 3,4,5,6,7,8, is usually what i always listen to when i pop this cd in. there others are okay too. if u like hardcore, u are sure to appreciate this, if u like metal, u will apperciate this even more.....best metal-core band there is right here, great live show too
B00005JMFQ|4.0|\\"Love Actually\\" is set in London during the Christmas season. I highly recommend this DVD as a perfect gift for that special someone on your list. Filmed with a talented ensemble cast, it is romantic, upbeat, sometimes irreverent and largely entertaining. If you enjoyed \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" or \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\" you will enjoy this film. By the way, a search on Froogle, Google's bargain sniffing search engine, just now says Amazon has the lowest price on this DVD. Enjoy!
B000002AGN|5.0|I dare say \\"Time Out\\" is easily Dave Brubeck's most famous and most popular recording.  When first released on LP it turned many non-jazz fans onto jazz.  Even those who were never ultimately converted dug \\"Time Out.\\" I had friends who only had one jazz recording in their collections and this was it.  Even after all these years the music on \\"Time Out\\" sounds fresh and inventive.  This is a classic recording and belongs in any jazz collection along with Miles Davis's \\"Kind of Blue\\" and John Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme.\\"  Each is completely different, each is classic jazz!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Despite some real flaws, I could not help but like this movie.  It has a quirky charm that left a smile on my face.
B0002KQNZO|5.0|If aliens from another galaxy landed on earth and asked me \\"what is hard bop jazz?\\" I would hand them this CD.  It is arguably one of the two best efforts by Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers (the other is titled Indestructible).....and that's saying something!  When the title cut was recorded it must have melted down Rudy Van Gelder's studio.  Wayne Shorter's opening tenor saxophone solo absolutely shreds!  If you listen closely you can hear his bandmates cheering him on.....and keep in mind this was recorded in a studio.  Trumpeter Freddie Hubbard and trombonist Curtis Fuller are also on fire.  During Blakey's drum solo he lets out a loud moan as if there was so much emotion even his drums couldn't express it.  The rest of the album is also top notch!  If you can own only one Art Blakey CD make it this one.  If you can own only two make the other one \\"Indestructible.\\"
B00005JNEI|1.0|Talk about \\"Angry White Man Syndrome\\"!  Michael Moore has an extremely skewed perspective on reality.  I don't know if I've ever seen an agrier movie.  The fact of the matter is that the majority of this stuff is all speculative, or in other words conjured up.  He has compiled footage, out of context I might add, in order to lead the viewer in Moore's little warped world.  Yet, he has the gall to call this a documentary. What a great country we live in where any idiot with a camera can make a derogatory & fabricated movie about our Commander in Chief, call it a documentary & get away with it.  GOD BLESS AMERICA!  I hear that this movie is a favorite with Alqaeda.  Maybe Mr. Moore would like to go overseas and hand them a personally signed copy. I'm sure they would be very appreciative.
B00005JN7O|1.0|I tried to give a negative rating but Amazon wouldn't let me.  A friend who works at Paramount invited me to a prescreening here in NYC last Wednesday.  This has to be one of the crappiest movies ever made.  When Paramount employees start walking out, you know it's bad.  I don't know what made Jude Law(who put up a hefty chunk of his own dough to get this film made) think he could pull this off.  This was a horrible film.  Just when you thought it was ending it started up again.  Cheesy dialogue for Law \\"Good Boy Dex\\" over and over.  Paltrow must have given up on her dreams of getting another Oscar.  Do NOT pay to see this film.  Wait for the DVD.  Paramount was supposed to release this film back in April.  Then pushed it to June now seem to have settled with this 9/17/04 release date.  This goes to show that even they know how bad this film is.    P.S.  Jolie in that corny eye patch?  Jeeze!    UPDATE!!!!    9-16-04    I wrote an earlier review expressing how bad I thought this film was. Now for all of you who either see the film tomorrow or over the weekend pay attention becuase this will show how bad this film is. When Paltrow and Law wake up in bed together they ask the Dhali Lama guy \\"Where's out clothes?\\" He replies \\"I burned them\\" or something to that effect. But then in the next scene they're wearing the same clothes that were 'burned'. What kind of HACK is that? Also note Dex's behaivor after they finally find him. Talk about 'Stepford'. The actor must have been upset that he actually signed on to do this film.    Goodnight!
B00023BLXK|2.0|If you saw the first Dirty Dancing, don't even bother watching this one!!  The only difference is the people & the place.  It was VERY predictable!!
B00005JNEI|1.0|In all of his films, Michael Moore misleads and even deceives his audiences in order to enhance whatever point he is trying to make, as anyone who takes the time to actually read anything about the man already knows.  Here, he is at his worst, presenting the wildest conspiracy-nut lore as fact without offering one shred of evidence and deliberatly omitting important facts that do not support his attacks on George W. Bush.  And he is so preoccupied with his crusade against the president that he does not even bother to make sure one claim does not contradict one he made five minutes ago.  Nor does he offer any model of how an administration should conduct itself during a war, or explain how he would have handled the fight against terrorists.  If you think Michael Moore loves America, than you might want to consider that a captured terrorist, Qaidar Faisal, quoted text from Moore's book \\"Stupid White Men\\" during his trial as justification of the jihad against the West.  This kind of blatant propaganda has no place in a democracy, and the fact that so many people embrace it should frighten anyone who loves living in a free country.
6305696071|1.0|The movie breaks itself in the scene where Edward Lewis (played by Gere) decides to have sex with Vivian Ward (played by Roberts), after teaching her a little how to play the piano. A few scenes latter, they're arguing and Lewis says something like, \\"I never treated you like a whore.\\"    He did treat her like one, though. I know I was disturbed, both by the sex and by the arrogance involved. I'm not disturbed by sexual content, but THIS sex scene ruined any empathetic equity Edward Lewis had earned up to that point. He became, in my mind, just another John. Well, not just another John... a John rich enough to retain the services of a hooker for an extended period of time. I haven't had any love for the uber-rich since I stopped watching the Richie Rich cartoon show.     So, from that point onward, it ceases to be simply a brainless romantic comedy, and becomes a study in Stockholm Syndrome masquerading as love. Edward Lewis is revealed as a psychologically manipulative person who is power-tripping on his own obscene wealth, and Vivian Ward is a willing abuse victim who is willing to sell not only her body, but her integrity as well.
B00009XITQ|5.0|ok i gotta admit , <br />when i saw the title \\"What A Girl Wants\\" i imediatelly thought of chick flick and teh thought of skipping it crossed my mind. <br /> <br />but am i glad i didn't, <br />it is a very entertaining and cool movie, <br />with great cast,and a soundtrack that rocks. <br />definitely one of the best comedies (if not the best comedy)of the year 2003.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I was pleasently surprised when I saw \\"Van Helsing\\" in the theaters. After reading all of the bad reviews (save for Roger Ebert, who loved it) I was a little worried that the movie was going to be as bad as everyone said it was. But instead, I was treated to a good summer-action flick with mindless action and lots of explosions. Why can't people just enjoy summer movies? Why do they have to criticize everything? I mean, come one, it's not going to win any Oscars so just enjoy this little piece of brain candy. The best part of the movie was Richard Roxburgh's Dracula. He was so cool! So rent or buy this movie and just have fun.
B00005JNEI|5.0|People may have a range of opinions about Michael Moore, but there is no denying actual footage that somehow never made it to our television screens.  To watch George Bush sit for SEVEN minutes in a classroom, with a deer-in-the-headlights look, after being informed that America was under attack is to know the true essence of the man.  To see him address contributors at a fundraiser as \\"the haves and the have mores\\" is revolting.  Forget Michael Moore---just watch the footage and ask yourself if you can honestly place our nation in George Bush's hands for four more years.
B000286RKW|5.0|What in the world were Warner Brothers thinking?  First they botched the Stanley Kubrick DVD Collection years ago when they released the worst looking video copies ever on DVD.  The VHS versions looked 10X better.      3 years ago they released the first Goodfellas DVD that had the outdated technology of a single layered disc that you had to flip over when the film was half way over.  The visual quality and treatment was average, but nothing great, for a very visually oriented film.      Now, 3 years later and something I've been looking forward to for a long time they release a 2 disc special features DVD for a very well made film.      I'm appalled and saddened to say that this version is the worst treatment to DVD I've ever seen.  You will see bleached out and washed out images that look ghostly.  You will see scratches on the film image (ie, the scene where DeNiro and Sorvino go over to Liotta's girlfriend penthouse to warn him about messing around with his wife) You will see colors that fade and flickers or light that have no purpose of being there.  You will see horizontal lines from time to time that appear out of nowhere.      You will see something that is horrifying to watch and something you can't miss becuase it's so distracting. On the interior shots in the bars or the darkly lit room scenes and there are square pixels all over the place.  This really will distract you.    I own a $3,500 Mitsuomi DVD player that is state of the art. It's a prototype from Japan and it's the best in the world. This player will fix flaws and try to correct them when playing back DVDs.   I also own a Sony Progressive scan DVD player that is top of the line for consumer models.  I played this DVD on both models and same result.  Absolute trash.      The first edition flip side DVD has much, much better quality and that DVD wasn't anything to laud over.      My advice to all of you is if your a big fan of the movie, buy it.  You'll like some of the special features (althoughthey are very very short) but don't get it if you think your getting an upgrade in quality...you're not, you're actually downgrading.  I'm deeply disappointed and very disturbed by this trashy release of a very good film.     Shame on you Warner Brothers.  You ruined a Great Film.
B0000894RZ|5.0|Lisa Stansfield has one of the greatest voices in music, yet with the exception of her debut CD, her musical efforts have not received the commercial acclaim that they warranted on this side of the Atlantic. Thank God for her native UK, as the fans have supported her and allowed her to have a career on her terms. This woman can do it all with a classic R &B voice that is both explosive yet ever so subtle depending on her intent. She can handle disco and heartbreak in the same breath. And for those of you who have heard the soundtrack for \\"Swing,\\" you already know that Lisa can tackle the classics like few in music can.<br /><br />This release more than lives up to its title, something rarely accomplished these days. This collection highlights Lisa's greatest hits in a non-chronological order that in my opinion generally better serves greatest hits collections. Released in 2003, the collection includes her very best from 1989's \\"Affliction\\" through her 2001 release \\"Face Up,\\" along with a live song with G. Michael and the living members of Queen. Although I am generally not a fan of live songs, this one hits the mark.<br /><br />Hearing this collection I am reminded not only how great a singer Lisa is, but how her sound has evolved through the years. In many ways, she seems to be from another era as her best songs are always sleek yet have much grit. It would seem to be a contradictory statement but Lisa's sound stands out because of these apparent contradictions. She is at once a chanteuse in the vein of a much earlier era who also happens to be right at home with the likes of Barry White and other 1970s legends.<br /><br />If you love female singers and have never been exposed to Lisa Stansfield, you should give this collection a shot. If you are already a fan but only remember her from the curly-cued girl who sand \\"All Around the World,\\" you will certainly like what she has been up to since she first hit the scene. In 1997, Lisa released a self-titled CD after a 6-year absence from the music scene that made some noise here in the States, but that release (which also earns 5 stars in my book) should have been a smash. It did well enough for her record company to put out a remixes CD that did quite well. A UK edition of this release has a bonus CD with some of the better remixes of her songs, so if you are interested in those be sure to look for that release as you won't find any of those here.<br /><br />P.S. for hard-core Lisa fans: I just found out via the Amazon UK site that in late September of this year Lisa will be releasing a new CD titled \\"The Moment.\\" It appears that she is no longer with Arista as the site says it will be released Ztt, which may be a German label. I am not sure if it will get a US release, but I am so happy that I happened to run into this while researching some dates for this review. I hope this helps.er a 6-year absence from the music scene that made some noise here in the States, but that release (which also earns 5 stars in my book) should have been a smash.

0060920084|1.0|I had hoped for a humorous look at America but was stunned to find caustic remarks instead.  This reminds me Bill Kaufmann's book Dispatches from the Muck Dog Gazette.  There is no affection for small towns here.  For some reason, the authors of both books find it amusing to bash small towns instead of embracing them for what they are.  I'm barely three chapters into the book and plan on tossing it.  I will not buy another Bill Bryson book again.
0440539811|5.0|It's a dreadfully long monster of a book and I certainly didn't have time to read it, but I've given it a thorough skimming. The authors are utterly incompetent-no sense of style or structure at all. It starts out as a detective story, switches to science----fiction, then goes off into the supernatural, and is full of the most detailed information of dozens of ghastly boring subjects. And the time sequence is all out of order in a very pretentious imitation of Faulkner and Joyce. Worst yet, it has the most raunchy sex scenes, thrown in just to make it sell, I'm sure, and the authors-----whom I've never heard of----have the supreme bad taste to introduce real political figures into this mishmash and pretend to be exposing a real conspiracy. I can't waste time reading such rubbish.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This is a good series.  If I had to describe it I would call it a American Western Sci-Fi show.  Some have suggested it is better then Stargate series.  I don't agree; I found Stargate much more enjoyable!  Some problems existed with Firefly that could have made the show a little more interesting.  First the guns look like old six shooters and make a cheep sound and effect when fired, so much for 500 years in the future!  Second, why are all the Alaince troops wearing Starship Trooper armour???  Did I miss something; is it a spin off in the same universe or something?  Not many of the people writing Firefly reviews have adressed that?  In general I found most of the costume and props cheep looking?  I would have given it 3.5 stars but you can't.  It's too bad that there is very little good science fiction on TV or at the movies.
B00004STPT|5.0|As one of the fellow reviewers said, this is an album where you listen to each song in its entirety and from start to finish. I loved the movie, in part because the soundtrack was so fitting for all of the various parts, from the battle scenes to the emperor's death to the March into Rome to \\"AM I NOT MERCIFUL??\\" to the end...beautiful stuff. Well worth investing in.
B000026OHN|5.0|These are undoubtedly the recordings that appeared on the JVC label in the early days of CD. The performances are unquestionably fine, but the cavernous echo throughout is quite distracting. It is hard to believe that professional audio engineers could have produced such abominable sound. Did they monitor as they went along? I have not heard this RCA incarnation, but I suspect they were unable to do much useful correction. <br /> <br />We can all be thankful that Richter recorded so prolifically. Better to have something from this great artist than nothing. However, he was frequently ill served by his recording engineers. Too bad. With just competent recording, we could have had one of the great WTCs.
B0001Z53C4|4.0|this is a good cd they have 3 hits so far on the cd My Band, 40 oz, and How Come. I think the next one will be Git up.
B000089RVR|4.0|This album really grew on me, and now I love it. The first single really caught my attention with it's honesty. That of course is the wonderful song \\"White Flag\\". I knew I had to have the CD. I actually like this one more than NO ANGEL, I just find I connect with the meaning and depth of this album more than her first one. The songs have a charismatic way of entering my head and staying there. The album didn't blow me away at first, but with each listen I find more I love about it. I can honestly say I like all of the songs on here. They have so far picked great singles. The title track is a very relatable song, a nice ballad with a moving chorus and melody. \\"Don't Leave Home\\" is my favorite though, a moving ballad of devotion. The video was very interesting and cool too. \\"Sand In My Shoes\\" is a nice song with a cool chorus that will stay with you. \\"Stoned\\" is an interesting song with an electronica edge (most of the songs here have elements of electronica mixed with pop) and some interesting lyrics. \\"Mary's In India\\" was not a favorite, but it grew on me. \\"See You When You're 40\\" is a great breakup song, and should be a single. Other highlights include \\"This Land Is Mine\\", \\"See The Sun\\", and \\"Who Makes You Feel\\". I wasn't disapointed at all.
B00005JN2F|5.0|wow.. this was an excellent film! I love the bourne identity and this one topped that!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|WOW! i'm sorry, but did i miss something here?  This movie was horrible.  A normal movie lover, i was bored out of my mind tossing and turning staring at my wall, pausing to go to the bathroom, running downstairs for some food... even fell asleep once.  what a waste of the $15.00 i paid for it.  maybe im missing something but this cheepo shot in tokyo looks like it cost $200 to make, and was a pointless movie.  all in favor that johnny should have won the Acadamy award instead say Aye...
B000002IOY|5.0|Released in 1989, this was a triumph for East Coast thrash band Overkill, who, although never popular in the mainstream (heaven forbid), continue to earn a devoted following in the underground. THE YEARS OF DECAY covers the spectrum of thrash styles: progressive riffing on 'Time to Kill', full-speed assault on 'Elimination' and 'Nothing to Die For', Sabbathy sludge on 'Skullkrusher', and ballad material (the title track). It all comes together on the closer 'E.vil N.ever D.ies', which basically does what 'Damage Inc.' does on Metallica's MASTER OF PUPPETS: reminds you that this band came to thrash. Some listeners dislike the vocals of Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth, but I personally don't mind them. The guitar attack, courtesy of Bobby Gustafson, is what mainly carries the album.
B0000AHRB0|5.0|Jackdaws is another great book by Follett.  The D-Day invasion is looming and the Allies are trying to cripple the Germans in anyway possible.  The hope to cripple a telephone exchange located in France and enlist the aid of the French Resistance to do so.  With time running out and other efforts failing, the Allies turn to Flick Clairet to lead an all women team into Germany to disable the telephone exchange, thus crippling the German communications right before the invasion.<br /><br />Dieter Frank is a German officer working under the authority of Rommell and trying to stop the resistance.  Frank is a smart man who catches many members of the resistance but always seems to be one step behind.  Frank is a somewhat sympathetic character who views duty as the ultimate call, and is great at torturing prisoners, even though he doesn't enjoy it.<br /><br />Set over 10 days, Follett moves along the plot at a brisk pace offering many twists and turns.  Jackdaws is in contrast to another recent novel by Follett, Hornet Flight, which seems to have a more deliberate pace and more character development.<br /><br />The characters in Jackdaws are intriguing, with Flick and her husband in the resistance who might be cheating on her and the American officer Paul Chancellor who falls in love with her.  Dieter Frank also has a French mistress who he saved from the concentration camp and therefore is ultmately devoted to him.  The team Flick brings with her to Germany is an interesting group with an aristocrat, a criminal, a lesbian and a transvestite.  The team members get the least attention by Follett, in spite of their interesting backgrounds.<br /><br />I've read many Follett novels, and all of them have been great, except for the Third Twin.  Follett is a master at putting you in the time period he writes about.  It'll be interesting to see how his next novel \\"WhiteOut\\" I believe, fares since it is set in the present day.
B00005JMEW|1.0|First off, I'm a Tarantino fan. I'm a Tarantino fan. I'm a Tarantino fan. Hmm... sorry... Just have to keep reminding myself of that after seeing this piece of crap. Oh, that's what it is! There is no denying it. It is a big stinking, heaping, load of crap... Sorry Quentin. <br />It is so painfully obvious that because of who he was, Quentin Tarantino was given free reign to do whatever he wanted and what he decided upon was style over substance. For such a talented writer, it is confusing as to how he could write Kill Bill vol. 1. Nothing of his earlier work is present. No humor. No interesting characters. No intelligent dialogue. Heck, there's hardly even any dialogue at all; just a bunch of noise, flashy imagery, and ridiculous amounts of blood.  <br />Then there are those lulls, points where the whole narrative just comes to a standstill. They were so boring it made my head hurt. When the action actually began to take place again, I just didn't care anymore. The movie had already dulled my senses. Even if I did care, the action itself was an exercise in idiocy, especially the ending. I just cannot suspend my disbelief enough to believe that one mortal flesh-and-blood person, no matter how masterful, can slaughter an entire room full of sword wielding martial artists. Oh, and then the one-on-one confrontation between the Bride and O-Ren is still supposed to hold some significance. Give me a break! The bride just killed a hundred people! How does O-Ren, or the audience, even concieve that she has a chance.  <br />Another thing that drove me crazy was the completely out of place anime sequence. I know Tarantino is known for not following a linear form or adhering to conventions, but having a cartoon right in the middle of your live action picture is too damaging. I like anime, but having it coincide within an actual live action movie doesn't work. It's too distracting. By the time the movie returned to the human actors I had become engrossed in the animation and had forgotten all about them.  <br />I wish I had something nice to say, but i don't. I've read other reviews praising the conglomaration of styles; Hong Kong Kung Fu, Spaghetti Westerns, etc. I believe that there's just one style missing however, Quentin Tarantino's. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000CFW87|5.0|A truly amazing CD. This CD is one of the best I've listened to.( Believe me, that's really something.) Josh Groban has beautiful,golden voice that will be remembered along his wonderful lyrics for years to come. Some ar sad. Some are spirit-lifting....a few I'm not even sure what he's saying but the tunes are catchy and I still sing along with him. All of them are hits in my opinion but here's a few to look forward to.. <br />You Raise Me Up( You can also check out the original version performed by the Christian group Selah.) <br /> When You Say You Love Me... <br />Remember When It Rained... <br />Oceano... <br />Al'Improvisso Amore...  <br />
0375756825|5.0|Quite possibly the most interesting and entertaining island novel i've read since Robinson Crusoe. This book defines all pirate tales and hidden caches of treasure. Outstanding!!!
B000099T2L|5.0|i bought this album when it came out and let mesay i was surprised. it was an amazing album although one song gets on my nerves.  the song \\"thats how you like it\\" with Jay Z sucks in my opinion but everythin else rocks.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|As i listened to 'My Band' the first 500 times, i was not real intent on buying this album. However, this isolated example of Hip-Pop is the only such case on the cd. All the other songs are pretty consistent with typical, off the chains D12 rap. While most of the songs are exceptional, \\"Good Die Young\\" is one of the best rap songs of ALL TIME for anyone who has lost a close friend at an adolescent age. D12 clearly understands what true hip-hop should be.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I loved this movie...even more so than the first.  Put them both together [Vol. 1 and Vol. 2] and you have one of the most satisfying compilations of brilliance and talent you could ever ask for.  Tarintino is a genious.
B00005JMCW|5.0|I am 16 year old guy and I am not that big of Lindsay Lohan fan.  Although I did enjoy the Parent Trap b/c that was hilarious, I hated her other movies like Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and that Disney Channel movie Get a Clue.  Not being a big fan of Lindsay was the main reason I chose not to see this movie when it was in theaters.  However, a few weeks ago, my cousin was watching this movie so I decided to watch a little of it and to my surprise I found it to be very funny.  After that I knew I had to see this movie.  I finally caught it on STARZ a few days ago and I loved it.  I found it to be very entertaining and funny.  I have even watched a few times since then and I am still laughing.  It charming, funny, and it made me see a side of Jamie Lee Curtis I have never seen before.  I actually regret seeing this in theaters.  Here is the plot. <br />Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Anna (Lindsay Lohan) Coleman have very frustrating lives.  Tess is a psychologist whose about to get married, yet her job is constantly frustrating her because she is constantly on 2 different cell phones or using a palm pilot.  Anna the daughter seems to be flunking in school, constantly going to detention, and always having to deal with her once best friend-now worst enemy rival in school.  And if that is not enough, both of them are always arguing against each other.  Anna always feels Tess is ruining her life she never listens and barely lets her music with her band.  Tess always feels like Anna acts the way she does because she feels the world revolves around.  But one day a magic spell causes them to wake up in each other's bodies!  Now what are they going to do.  They must somehow find way to switch back because Tess is getting married.  However when living in each other bodies, they both end up learning the difficulties in each other's lives and have a better understanding of each other.  In the end they both learn to have a better respect of each other. <br />Freaky Friday is a funny well-moving film that deals with real life problems.  I know usually guys my age would not care for a movie like this but that is their opinion.  I suggest Feaky Friday to anybody no matter if they're a Lindsay Lohan fan or not. <br />
B000002KIT|5.0|My first copy of this album was a (pirated) copy of a friends album in 1979.  Since then I have purchased it on Vinyl, pre-recorded tape and finally CD.  Even after 25 years it has not grown old!  I still listen to it frequently.  <br /> <br />A great live performance from one of the best rock bands ever.  I only wish I could have seen them live!
B00005JMUA|5.0|Alright... It should be abundently clear that this is a fantastic movie...  I have yet to hear of anyone who \\"didn't like it,\\" and as far as movie experiences go, Kill Bill Vol 2 did not disappoint. <br /> <br />In fact, it had fantastic surprises, turns of events, and overall cinematography, and was just a delightful watch...  I liked it and David Carradine's performance as Bill so much that I went out and bought the complete first season of Kung Fu.   <br /> <br />Kill Bill Vol 2 obviously follows the character played by Uma Thurman, \\"the Bride\\" further down the path to retribution for the murder of her family.  Bill is played in a marvelously sadistic yet serene manner by Carradine, and it's by far the best peice of work I've ever seen him do.  Michael Madson does not dissappoint, nor does Daryl Hannah, and Gordon Liu is scene stealing as the old priest, Pai Mei. <br /> <br />There is little that can disappoint with this movie as it has a great pace, Tarrentino's amazing sense of detail shows through in almost every scene, and the only complaint I have heard from anyone about the movie is that they didn't like that the body count was lower in Volume 2 than Volume 1.  Basically, Volume 1 is a classic revenge movie that explains the characters briefly, with more depth on the specific characters who star in it and a little cameo depth on the characters for Volume 2.  It asks all the questions and leaves you wondering what's going to happen for Volume 2. <br /> <br />Volume 2 answers the questions and also has some great plot twists and things to throw you off the track a bit, and delves deep into the relationships between Bill and The Bride (I'm not giving away her name for the sake of those who have only seen Vol 1...), and is just a marvelous peice of filmmaking...  It's very possibly the best martial arts movie ever made, and as Martial Arts Movies go, I liken Kill Bill Vols 1 and 2 as comparable to how The Godfather Vols 1 and 2 are to Mob movies.  There may besome other great mob movies out there, but nothing quite compares to the first two Godfather movies...  There may be some great martial arts flicks out there, but nothing will ever quite compare to Kill Bill Vols 1 and 2.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The Passion of the Christ in my view was done in amazing detail and deserves wide reconition for it's cinamatic performance. It is not a movie you can say that you enjoyed or liked; but one that has an objective view of the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ and paints the picture like it truely was.  <br />While watching the movie, I was not motivated one bit to have one ounce of hate towards the Jewish people or anyone else for that matter. I did shed tears when watching this--you couldn't help it, the way they portray Jesus willing to suffer so horribly for the sins of man kind--in which is why He was put to death, to atone for us. If anyone should be mad at someone, look at yourself. It was because of US that He died and was crucified, not the Jews.  <br />And just a little side note: If some Christians beleive Jew's are to blame for the death of Jesus...apparently they forget that the Gospels say that HE ROSE AGAIN! So technically, He is not dead but in heaven. Just a thought. <br /> <br />Yes, as a historian I did see some historical inacuracies in clothing styles and the laungage. At the time of Jesus the Romans would not have spoken Latin, but a dialect of Greek that was prevailant at the time. (refer to St Paul's letters for varification) Other than that, Mel Gibson's movie was true to the Gospels one hundred precent and deserves a round of applause for such a great presentation.
0385659806|5.0|Mark Haddon has written a very clever one-of-a-kind novel.  I loved it.  It's thoughtful, surprising, funny, and moving.  Yep, it's got it all.

0385720920|5.0|This book made me a Chuck fan - I had thought nothing could compare to Fight Club and I was wrong - this book was just as great, but a little different.  It explores a very unlikable character through his weird life and mind.  Sex Addicts, Jesus, and Choking what else could you want!
0471267554|5.0|I grew up believing that all the things I was eating are good for me.  Surely white flour products like bread, bagels, cereals (especially coco puffs) are good for me.  All the advertisers told me so.  But reading this book and others by (Melissa Diane Smith, Burton Berkson, Jack Challem etc...) my paradigm changed. This and the other authors give you just the facts, it's well documented, meaning it is the truth.  On April 28 (my weight was 173) my doctor told me my cholesterol was almost 300.  He suggested \\"Crestor\\" to lower it.  Thank god to never took the drugs.  You next questions should be \\"well what is you cholesterol and weight now\\".  Well, after about two months, July 1, my cholesterol was 137 (actually this is to low, but I didn't think it would work so fast) my weight was 153.  My fasting glucose is 79; my Blood pressure is 110/120 over 60/70. I'm 48 and feel like 28. <br /> <br />When I read other comments stating that this author is wrong, misguided and just plain wrong, I just had to write.  Just look at the facts, they speak for them selves.   <br /> <br />I had the misfortune of telling my friends who are on medication that they to can be drug free, feel better, never be hunger, live longer, etc....   they just ignore it and go on doing the same thing.    <br /> <br />Don't be stupid, read this book, follow it for just 3 months, even if you don't believe it to be true.  After the 3 months you will know who telling the true. <br /> <br />shakercuda@yahoo.com <br />
B0000024JA|5.0|Methical brings his 36 Chambers, and surprisingly, the overall feel is darker.  The cover of the album is very fitting, the video for Bring Da Pain correctly paints the picture i imagaine in my mind when listening to the album:  dark, scary!  But hardcore!  I like it, it has a serperate place among solo Wu Tan albums.  Although it is not as good as the counterparts Liquid Swords, or Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, it holds its own as one of the top five Wu Solo albums.  And it has a hip hop classic on it:  I CAME TO BRING THE PAIN HARDCORE TO BRAIN!! this goes out like astralplane.....
B000003S09|5.0|I first heard this from a dub tape a friend had made for me. He had incluled \\"Karn Evil 9\\" by ELP as the first track. I literally jumped the first time I heard \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", it being the second track. For a 16 year old, this meant:keeper! This is a true classic album, if only for the lyrics. Listen closely to \\"Epitaph\\" and you will understand. It sounds like it was made very recently; I hear something \\"new\\" with each playing. And be prepared for the \\"surprise\\" at the end of \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\"...
B000006TRV|5.0|A lot of people think that Dark Side of the Moon is the best album by this particular band.  While the peak as pop stars coincides and is because of that particular album, the artistic peak is The Wall.<br /><br />While self indulgent at times, the basic intimacy and the way the album as a whole speaks to the modern human condition makes this album stand out their best artistic achievement by far.<br /><br />While \\"We don't need no education\\" made a fairly high mark on the charts - the album does not make sense except in its entirety.  The album is a story of common, bad, childhood experiences and the growing alienation of success and adulthood - the emptiness, and triviality of success.  Pink Floyd in the arc of the story - lays the banality and alienation of success bare - it ends up blocking the person from the world and the artist from the audience.  At one point in the album, the artists command the audience to do anything however repulsive (anyone been at a rock concert where the band seemed like they could command the audience to do anything and they would?!).  After alientation is complete, the main character \\"Pink\\" is judged and found guilty.  He has to tear down the wall and live a genuine life a result that is both fightening and liberating.<br /><br />While not the poppiest of their albums, and not their musically best, this is the album which shows their artistic peak and is a worthy addition to someone interested in Pink Floyd.
B000000Y2F|5.0|When two of the greatest jazz musicians of all time get together, one would expect nothing less than sheer brilliance. This album delivers. There is a wonderful playfulness to this album that makes it one of my favorites.
B00005U2LM|1.0|I hate to see WUTANG's name on this album.  The beats are so far away from what Wu Tang is famous for, and the songs need good beats first to be good songs.  I don't care if there is the best verse in hip hop history (which of course is not on this).  YOU NEED GOOD BEATS!!! I can't believe the RZA.  What is he doing in his life that is so much more important than recreating that Wu Tang sound!!  If this is the WuTang of now, I abandon all future efforts by them.   Unless some magic time capsule brings them back to 1993, then they will continue to make this stupid sh**
B00003CXCT|3.0|Is this DVD set the original Star Wars films or the Special Editions released a few years ago?
B000002OX7|5.0|Who's Next is the 1971 masterpiece album for which Pete Townshend and company will be remembered, not Tommy or Quadrophenia.  Of the original nine songs (tracks 1-9 here), no fewer than six were staples of classic rock radio, deservedly so. Until this album, the Who were known primarily for their classic sound of guitars, bass and drums. On Who's Next, it is keyboards which dominate, whether the legendary synthesizer riffs created by Towser on \\"Baba O'Reilly\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" or the wonderful piano added by guest Nicky Hopkins (who also assisted with discs by the Rolling Stones, Quicksilver, and Jefferson Airplane, among others) on \\"The Song is Over\\". \\"Bargain\\" finds Roger Daltry singing at his very best, while \\"Going Mobile\\" is voiced by Pete at his most playful. Perhaps the album's shining gem is \\"Behind Blue Eyes,\\" full of lyric subtlety and texture, an incredibly accurate look into the face of evil. Of the bonus tracks, \\"Pure and Easy\\", \\"Baby Don't You Do It\\", and \\"Water\\" are all standouts; the fact that none of the bonus songs are up to the high standards set by the rest of the album is beside the point, they are all quite good. In sum, Who's Next is the finest album in the band's long and storied career. If Horton, the imaginary elephant created by Dr. Seuss, were a fan of great rock and roll, he would most certainly hear The Who.
B00024BHTC|1.0|Whats this twit on?  People trying to pull down the rating?  Same people slagging off the record?  When people spend their money they have every right to comment pal!  I can't endorse this record, it's just not as good as some are saying.  So Avoid!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|For any Pacino or gangster flick genre fans, this movie is a must own. I wouldn't say its Pacino's best film hes ever been in, but to me Tony Montana was his best role and one of the best film characters in history. Pacino burns up the screen with his trademark intensity and bravado in a way only he can deliver. <br /> <br />The movie itself involves the tale of the rise and fall of a man. Pacino starts out as a Cuban immigrant with nothing and eventually becomes the druglord of Miami. Of course once he makes it to the top the only way left to go is down...and down hard he goes. Tony is the classic anti-hero; hes the \\"bad guy\\" but you can't help but root for him throughout the movie. There's something in Tony's character that anyone can admire whether its his ambition, honesty, boldness...or over the top accent. We are left to realize that Tony's way of life is the only way out for someone of his status to be in his mind a success. Its either living the thug life or breaking his back washing dishes for minimum wage.   <br /> <br />Scarface will strike you with its authenticity and realism in a way most movies can't. It also has some of the most memorable lines and scenes you'll ever see. Just hands down a great flick.
B0000062Y2|5.0|I own both the London Concept Recording with Ian and Murray Head and the JCS movie soundtrack*.  Some people say one is better than the other (usually it is people putting down this soundtrack and praising the original concept version).  I have no idea why so many people hate this recording because I absolutely love it.  Ted Neely is just different from Ian Gillian.  Gillian gives a wonderful performance, and so does Neely.  Gillian has a more hard rock voice while Neely has more emotion in his singing.  You can hear Neely's hurt, confusion, fear, and frustrations.  \\"Gethsemane\\" by Neely is very powerful, and I actually prefer it over Gillian's (I love Gillian- he's not bad at all, I just LOVE Neely).  Carl Anderson is a -wonderful- Judas.  He has such a powerful voice, and you can really relate to him.  I love his \\"Heaven on their minds\\".  All of his solos are wonderful!  You can hear his agony and anger.  \\"Superstar\\" is also fantastic.  Yvonne Elliman is from the Original Concept album, and so is Barry Dennon.  Both wonderful singers!  The Caiaphas is exceptional on this album- his voice is wonderful!  I find the Annas a bit annoying because of the high voice, but I guess it's supposed to be like this!  The only casting I would change is the Herod because he can't really sing!  I highly recommend this album because it is wonderful!  Get the DVD!!!<br /><br />*I actually made my own soundtrack from the dvd because I have heard that the actual cd has bad sound quality- the one I made is the same quality of the dvd and is excellent.
B000148KK2|5.0|...why people aren't giving this one 5 stars. It's a bit of a departure. IMHO it's a little deeper and maybe even darker...but I like the difference. May be the Elvis Costello influence? (I don't understand THAT either...what a waste!)One review I read somewhere said it's not her typical wallpaper music. I disagree with that description, but most of her other stuff has been a little more accessible. I think she's the most consistent and most talented of this generation of female singers/musicians. Still not QUITE Julie London...but in many ways even better. Recommend w/o reservation.
B000059GEH|4.0|The only reason I rented this movie is because I am a Marilyn fan. This movie was really boring compared to her other films. Basically the movie is about three New York models named Shatze (Lauren Bacall), Pola (Marilyn Monroe), and Loco (Betty Grable). They are all golddiggers as well. They rent this really nice lavish apartment. Shatze comes up with a plan that they set up to find eligible millionaire bachelors so they can marry them. And it turns out two of them fall for poor men. This movie has a couple of laughs but overall I found it kinda boring! The costumes were really neat and pretty. I don't condsider this as one of Marilyns best but if your a fan of hers its worth a see!
B00005LC1H|5.0|Come visit the worst-run hotel in the whole of western Europe (well, except for that place in Eastbourne...)<br /><br />In a field with many top contenders, 'Fawlty Towers' remains my favourite of all 'Britcoms' - situation comedies originating on British television.  Fawlty Towers has a cult following decades after the originals aired; it is sometimes hard to believe that there are but 12 episodes, six hours total.  The regular cast is led by John Cleese, veteran of the famous Monty Python comedy troupe, as the irrepressible Basil Fawlty, titular head of the hotel with dreams of class and glory; Prunella Scales is his long-suffering and hardworking wife, Sybil, who recognises that while Basil may think 'the sky's the limit!', in fact, '22 rooms is the limit'.  Connie Booth (Cleese's real-life wife) played the level-headed and sensible, overworked maid Polly, and in a role matched only by Fawlty's own bizarre manner, Andrew Sachs plays the loveable and ever-incompetent Spanish waiter, Manuel (he's from Barcelona...).  Ballard Berkeley makes a regular appearance as the Major, a retired long-term resident at the hotel.  Brian Hall joined the cast for the second season as the not-quite-gourmet chef, Terry.<br /><br />From the very first episode (first aired in 1975) featured a social-climbing Fawlty as perhaps the most rude and insufferable hotel manager in existence, in the resort town of Torquay, on the Channel coast of Britain.  Sybil tries to maintain a reasonable level of service, but Fawlty's snobbishness permits him to be gracious (indeed, excessively fawning) toward those he considers 'worthy', which in this episode turns out to be Lord Melbury, who ends up not being Lord Melbury, but rather a confidence trickster, and Fawlty's revenge scares away the real 'posh' guests, whom Fawlty sends off with the hilarious shout, 'Snobs!'<br /><br />In each of the episodes, there is a crisis - one gets the sense that the life of Fawlty is non-stop crisis, with his wife and Polly forever picking up the pieces, Manuel always complicating things, and the others wandering around in a state of disbelief (or, in the case of the Major, perpetual daze).  The twelve episodes highlight all the things that could wrong at hotel in classic comedic fashion - the institution of a Gourmet Night falls flat when the not-quite-recovering alcoholic chef starts drinking the night of the main event; a guest dies in the middle of the night, and Fawlty tries to slip him out unnoticed; remodelers install and remove the wrong doors; the health inspector unexpected shows up and gets served a bit of rat with his cheese.<br /><br />However, nothing quite matches the kinds of situations Basil can get himself into.  When trying to plan a surprise anniversary dinner for his wife, she leaves the hotel thinking that Basil has forgotten again, and Basil dresses Polly up as a sick-bed-bound Sybil to fool the guests.  When Polly's friends check in for a wedding over the weekend, Basil suspects the group of free sexual expression (highlighting his own repression); this theme is carried over to a glorious extreme in the episode about the visiting Psychiatrist.<br /><br />'How does he make his living?' Basil protests.  'He makes his money by sticking his nose into others' private parts, er, details...'<br /><br />This is also the episode where Sybil finally confronts Basil about his double-sided hotel manner toward guests: 'You're either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrine puff adder,' she declares.  He replies in perfect form, 'Just trying to enjoy myself, dear.'<br /><br />As the psychiatrist will comment near the end, there's enough material for an entire psychiatrist conference.  Indeed there is, as this is slapstick humour with a difference.  Intelligent and witty while utterly chaotic and beyond the pale, one is treated to the moose-head incident and the ingrowing toenail as well as Fawlty's unique form of automobile motivation (how many of us have ever been tempted to whack away at a stalled car with a stick!) and a nice performance of Brahms (his 'third racket', to be precise).  One must not overlook the little details, either, including the ever-changing sign in front (the actual hotel used for the exteriors unfortunately burned down many years after the show), and the fact that the interior and exterior layouts of the building cannot correspond (shades of 'The Simpsons' whose furniture layout changes from scene to scene).<br /><br />It is almost inconceivable that the two series, each of six episodes, were four years apart (1975 and 1979), as they flow rather seamlessly together.  Popular on television networks worldwide, it can be seen variously on BBC America and local public television channels, often during the fund drives, when the most popular pieces are shown.<br /><br />The DVD has various extras, including interviews with Cleese, Scales and Sachs (Booth was not available); there are director's commentaries as well as a tour of the now-abandoned hotel used for the exterior (a rather bizarre piece, that).  The extras are sadly substandard, but the series itself is excellent, and worth having in the digital format.e form of automobile motivation (how many of us have ever been tempted to whack away at a stalled car with a stick!) and a nice performance of Brahms (his 'third racket', to be precise).

Popular on television networks worldwide, it can be seen variously on BBC America and local public television channels, often during the fund drives, when the most popular pieces are shown. <br /> <br />The DVD has various extras, including interviews with Cleese, Scales and Sachs (Booth was not available); there are director's commentaries as well as a tour of the now-abandoned hotel used for the exterior (a rather bizarre piece, that).  The extras are sadly substandard, but the series itself is excellent, and worth having in the digital format.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000A118M|4.0|I don't know why some people seem to think this album is not structured or something. Maybe it's just me but I get the feeling that a great deal of thought went into the overal composition. If you're not used to music that doesn't have a clear cut melody perhaps this isn't your cup of tea. But you can safely disgard most contemporary non-pop music then. <br />I'm more of a contemporary classics listener myself (have been for years) so I guess I'm used to this kind of thing. <br />In fact this doesn't sound so shockingly non-musical or a-melodic to me at all. It's pretty straightforward jazz. <br />I was a little bit dissappointed even with regard to that respect. I thought it would be more different. I liked it plenty the first time but now after a few listens I'm starting to appreciate more of the detail in it. Good stuff ! <br />
B00003CXC7|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best movies ever made. Hitchcock, the master of suspence, has no equal and this is arguably his best movie. Jimmy Stewart is phenomenal, but Grace Kelley is truly amazing, especially to look at. It certainly makes us all wish she had never married and given up making movies. All the other reviewers have talked about all the aspects of this movie but one--the fact that it gives us such a wonderful glance at life in New York City in the 1950s. Granted, it is a very narrow look, but it is one that has kept me enthralled since I first saw this movie more than 25 years ago. See this movie.

B0001AVZA8|4.0|I am in my 40's and I love watching movies with mature actors.    I watched this dvd last night, and I love it. I have been a Diane Keaton fan back to Annie Hall.     I feel I got to know a different Diane this time. A much more mature one. It was refreshing.    I am not a great fan of Jack Nicholson, and I think at the first part of the movie, he was not that great - but he acted much better than I expected.    It was a joy to watch these two excellent actors.    Only bad thing about this movie - it's way too long.
B000W796OM|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN. As the novels progressively become darker, I had assumed that the movie would be darker, too. I also figured that unlike the first two movies, there would be a great deal of detail left out. Other than that I didn't know.<br /><br />My presumptions proved accurate. HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is a much darker movie that its predecessors and there is a great deal from the novel that is left out. However, neither of these two elements really make the movie any less enjoyable. A movie and a novel are two completely different types of storytelling and with a book that's well over 300 pages, there's no way to film the book scene by scene, unless you make a mini-series. Overall, the movie version of PRISONER OF AZKABAN stays faithful to the spirit of the novel. It condenses a few events to speed up the pace of storytelling and it leaves many happenings completely out, but the meat of the story is left intact.<br /><br />In AZKABAN, we find the Harry is just slightly more respected by his Aunt and Uncle. However, in a fit of rage, Harry lets loose a little magic and turns his aunt into an overflated human balloon. Harry knows he's messed up big time and takes his belongings and leaves. He's picked up by a magical bus and eventually finds himself back at Hogwarts. Along the way he learns that one of the most notorious criminals in the magical world, Sirius Black, has escaped from the unescapable prison of Azkaban. That's news itself, but what's even bigger news and something that Harry doesn't learn until later, is that Sirius Black is coming for Harry. Add in some horrifying indifferent magic guards, a few fights with Harry's school enemies, a little time travel, and a few werecreatures and you've got the set up for the best part of the Harry Potter series so far.<br /><br />HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN will probably be the movie that fans of the books will enjoy the least, especially since it leaves out so much detail. However, as a movie, it's probably the best of the bunch. The actors get actually get a chance to act this time around. Unfortunately, that's also the only major flaw of the film. There is so much stuff going on and certain events that have to unfold to keep the continuity of the story going that we don't get to see much character development at all--we're presented with a wonderful cast of characters with a hugely talented cast, but we really don't get to know any of the characters better. Perhaps that will happen as the movies progress.

B00005JNEI|1.0|If you take this as total fact, then I'll gladly sell you the deed to a bridge in Brooklyn that I own.  I love that people say we never should have gone to war with Saddam, that he never posed a threat or attacked us.....WRONG!  I have a big glaring fact to back that up.  Remember back in 1991 when we beat Iraq in the first Gulf War and he signed a treaty with the U.S. and U.N.?  Remember that?  Ok, good.  Now, during the 12 years between that treaty and the launching of the 2nd war, how many times did Iraqi armed forces fire on British and American aircraft in the no-fly zones?  Hmmmmmm?  I seem to recall that the International Rules of Engagement do specify that an act of war is considered when one country commits an attack against another.  So, according to the rules, we had HUNDREDS of reasons to invade Iraq.  This fact is so poorly missed in Moore's distortion of factual truth.  If you watch this film, it does get to you, but it is so anti-Military that this ex-marine did all he could from tearing down the screen.  His interview with the mother who lost her child in Iraq is sad, but here's the thing....HE WASN'T DRAFTED!  HE CHOSE TO GO!  Let me run that by you again, just like I did in 1992, I CHOSE TO JOIN.  Meaning, that as an adult (not children like Moore calls us, an 18 year old may be young, but is still a legal adult) I knew the consequences of joining the military.  I knew that I may have to go to war if the country calls for it.  I'm saddened to see the apathy that permeates our society.  The youth of today have no concept of history, they don't know what it takes to defend freedom.  Telling me, as Moore does in the movie, that Saddam didn't consort with terrorists is like saying that Steven Speielberg never directed \\"Jaws\\".  Shame on Moore for capitalizing on the deaths of my fellow soldiers who removed one of the most BRUTAL dictators next to Adolf Hitler.  Bravo to the soldiers who wouldn't give Moore the time of day.  I just wish in the end that it was I whom he tried to interview.  I'm sure that wouldn't make it into the final cut.
B00007LL7O|5.0|Few CDs, if any, have such a large percentage of songs on it that I love.  You know that feeling?  How many of your CDs do you spend most of your time listening to just waiting for your 2 favorite songs?  I do that a lot.  Not on this CD (or any of Stratovarius's CD for that manner).  The album is about 62 minutes long, also.   <br /> <br />It is important for you to know that I own 12 Stratovarius CDs (Fright Night, T.T., D., Fourth Dimension, E., V., Visions of Europe, D., I., Intermission, Elements 1, and Elements 2), the DVD Infinite Visions, and a shirt for this band.  Only one other band do I own more than 3 albums by.  And that band is Nightwish.  Needless to say, I enjoy Stratovarius a LOT.  About 45 of my about 400 favorite songs are by Stratovarius - far more than by any other band.  Off this album, those songs include Find Your Own Voice, Fantasia (fav. of the album), Papillon, Stratofortress, Elements, and A Drop in the Ocean.  Get that?  2/3 of the songs!  Sorry - I don't find Eagleheart that great.  Its also the least Strato-like song I think they've ever recorded, musically.   <br /> <br />What most people hate about this album is what I love - orchestration, Timo's wailing, 2 epics, and the instrumental Stratofortress.  What I don't like is the no double-bass songs.  Well... at least `not enough' of them.  I know we're never gonna get another Father Time since the band's no more, but it would have been nice to have another song to be similar to that.  It seems that the really fast songs were only on their older albums.   <br /> <br />The funny thing with this album is the atmosphere.  The cover art really does make you feel like you're in the sky!  Just give Elements or A Drop in the Ocean one listen and try to tell me different.  The solos on Stratofortress also give that feeling.  The whole album does, but it's the strongest at the end of the album.   <br /> <br />The albums \\"real\\" opener is Soul of a Vengabond, which I am not too fond of at the time.  Find Your Own Voice is the closest to older Stratovarius you'll hear on the album.  Fantasia's a lot like Mother Gaia and The Power of One in the sense that its like \\"what would our world be like if there were no wars or religion?\\"  Learning to Fly is semi-filler to me, but Papillon is one heck of a powerful song.  Its wicked slow, but in-your-face loud.  Lots of wailing in that song, and in the title track.  I recently looked at the lyrics to Elements (the song) closely - it looks like its simply a guy (Timo) asking \\"why are humans so selfish?\\" and such, and the answer he gets is 8 elements in 2 sets:  wind, water, fire, earth, and then fear, anger, sorrow, joy.  That song should give you chills, even though its not quite as good as it could have been.  I've read that A Drop in the Ocean is Celestial Dream, Part II (from Infinite), but I'm not sure about that.  They're both drumless ballads, but I don't see the relationship.   <br /> <br />Seriously - for any fan of euro metal of any kind (or if you like Rammstein for the orchestration), you just gotta give this album a (2nd, in some situations) try.  As a whole, this is my favorite Stratovarius album.  Visions, Fourth Dimension, and Infinite are in a close 2nd.  Then probably Twilight Time and Destiny.  Episode and Elements 2 are next, and I don't wanna go further than that.   <br /> <br />I hope I helped you in deciding whether to or not purchase this (wonderful) album.  If I helped, please say so!  I have a lot of other reviews (and now, I have my own list here on amazon!), so read them when you get a chance.  Type in \\"Tunnelvision\\" and you should get to the list.   <br />
0783229526|4.0|The only thing I remember thinking about this movie when it appeared in theaters was \\"Why release a film version of this now?\\" Who thought Hunter S. Thompson's seminal novel about drug addiction and Las Vegas would play to a savvy 1990's audience? At least the studio did the right thing by hiring Monty Python member and auteur of the bizarre Terry Gilliam to lens the picture. Outside of Luis Bunuel or Salvador Dali, I can't think of any other artist who could pull off such a wacky, unusual project. Thompson's novel, if you're not familiar with it, recorded the exploits of a journalist (Thompson himself) and his lawyer (Thompson's real life legal eagle) as they descended into one bleak bout with narcotics after another, all while supposedly covering the Mint 400 motorcycle race for Rolling Stone magazine. The novel theoretically details the search for the real America--or at least the American Dream--in the early years of the 1970s. Finding allusions to an ephemeral American paradise is difficult in the extreme in a book chock full of crazed drug abuses because the hilarity of two guys tottering on the edge of insanity again and again tends to obscure any meaningful message. But Thompson did pull it off.<br /><br />Aside from a few scenes, Gilliam's film version largely fails to convey Thompson's fundamental themes. That the movie fails to do so should not surprise the audience. Cinema, after all, must rely on grandiose images and over the top antics to grab attention. Not every film falls prey to bombastic delivery, but \\"Fear and Loathing\\" cannot help itself. There's simply too much weirdness going on, too many metaphysical oddities popping up every few minutes, to worry about elucidating subtler themes. Within the first few minutes of the film, we know exactly what sorts of strange things will unfold. Hunter Thompson (Johnny Depp) and his lawyer (Benicio Del Toro, nearly unrecognizable under all that hair and sweat) roar down the highway on their way to Las Vegas and the Mint 400. Something's not quite right with these two. Their condition probably has a lot to do with the arsenal of narcotics stashed in the trunk of the car. They've got pills, booze, and a host of other powders and tonics designed to keep a person in the twilight zone for the next thirty years. They've even got a jug of ether, the fools. And they're driving. Fast. No wonder that hitchhiker (Tobey McGuire, by the way) decides to flee from the vehicle.<br /><br />And that's the movie in a nutshell. Depp and Del Toro move from one wildly implausible scene to another, hallucinating madly and always an inch away from complete mental and physical breakdown. These two yucks stumble around a casino flipping their lids over the lights, sounds, and strange people they encounter. Thompson sees tables full of people morph into evil looking dinosaurs. The lawyer, locked in the bathroom, ponders dropping a tape player blaring Jefferson Airplane's \\"White Rabbit\\" into the very bathtub in which he sits. This dynamic duo survives many incidents, including car crashes, a day spent at a police officers' convention, and the kidnapping of a local youth. You can imagine what their hotel rooms look like after a few days of such activities-well, you probably can't. Throughout it all, the guys try as hard as they can to maintain appearances. Depp's character provides plenty of voiceovers to help keep the audience afloat in a sea of narcotized blackouts. \\"Fear and Loathing\\" resembles more a giant stream of consciousness bender than a coherent film. What does it all mean? Good question.<br /><br />A scene in the film explains part of the mystery. Thompson, in a reflective mood during a rare moment of actual work on his story, undergoes a flashback where he sees himself at a concert in the late 1960s. He waxes morosely on those lost days when the youth of America thought they could change things for the better. As we all know, nothing really changed. America eventually pulled out of Vietnam, but the flower children grew up and sprouted suits and cell phones. At least a few grew up; many perished as their addictions became too much to handle. Thompson and his lawyer represent the latter stages of the 1960's Counterculture. No one would have thought about using ether or going on two week binges during the Summer of Love, but by the time the early to mid 1970s rolled around, the halcyon glow of yesteryear has turned into a nightmare. These two characters are essentially the living, walking hangover of a bygone age. When you look at the movie in this way, the hilarity drains out of the whole thing quite rapidly. Heck, when you see Hunter Thompson today on a talk show, as I did recently, his shambling, incoherent speech doesn't garner a whole lot of chuckles from these quarters. His condition is depressing, and so is \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\\"<br /><br />The movie's good points include the two principal actors' performances and Gilliam's sure handed direction. Johnny Depp has probably never turned in a bad performance, and he continues his winning streak here as the hectic Thompson. He's got the look, mannerisms, and attitude of the gonzo journalist down cold. Del Toro frightens as the surly, monstrous lawyer. Most of the credit for this intriguing film falls on Terry Gilliam's shoulders; he's always at home creating believable scenes of altered reality, and this movie has more than its fair share. While I think \\"Brazil\\" and \\"Twelve Monkeys\\" are vastly superior to \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\\" Gilliam has yet to disappoint me with any of his films. Give this one a shot if you're up to massive weirdness a metatectonic scale. I recommend reading the book first, though.of Vietnam, but the flower children grew up and sprouted suits and cell phones.

B000002ARV|2.0|Johnny Winter was never really into Rock (being more of a bluesman)but at times he at least pretends to like it. <br />This album is one of those times. <br />Once again Johnny has to rely on Rick Derringer to prop him up,dust him off and get him thru this album. <br />If it wasn't for the solid production skills of Rick Derringer this album might have flopped but Rick pulls it through not only providing Johnny with the title tune but also finding him a drummer(Richard Hughes). <br />Another popular tune was Dan Hartman's Can't you feel it. <br />It seems Johnny was never much of a songwriter. <br /> It's amazing this lp made it to #23 on the billboard charts at the time, even though it never had anything close to a hit single. <br />One wonders though was it Johnny or the success of the then Edgar Winter Group which helped the album along?

But here in the rerelease we get yet the same version of the flick as before with a better picture and not the different soundtrack. Sounds alot like Scarface to me.<br /><br />The audio com's as cool as they are, are not that worthy of repeat listening.<br /><br />SO what else does this \\"new\\" double DVD have? Deleated scenes? No. Uncut version of the film? No. Retarded extras that you would only view once with nothing added to the film? Yup.<br /><br />Waste your money if you want, I smell a 20 year Special Edition waiting in the wings.<br /><br />The only reason to release this now is that Henry Hill is over the hill and may not be around to see that edition.<br /><br />Thanks.

B00005JMUA|2.0|The first film was pretty good, despite the fact that it stars two of the dark horses of the Apocolypse: Lucy Lu and Uma Thurman. This film has 1 (ONE) decent fight scene in it and lots of supposedly \\"intense\\" dialog.  <br /> <br />David Carradine and his phony martial arts pedigree shows up in the middle and at the end of this endurance test of a film to talk......and talk and talk and talk. In fact, the entire film is a blab-fest.  <br /> <br />I'm glad that I did'nt pay serious movie $$ to go see Part 2; Kill Bill should have been one long, good film instead of 1 good film and one bad one. <br /> <br />

B00006L7XQ|5.0|I've been sitting hear staring at this review space for a good twenty minutes now because I'm having a very hard time coming up with words to accurately describe how beautiful, profound and poignant this album is. I was never a fan of Johnny Cash, and up until American Music 4, I had never heard any of his work, but let me tell you, as a genuine fan of music, regardless of time or genre, I can honestly say this last breath of music that Mr. Cash mustered up is absolutely indispensable. Fifteen songs came out of the deepest, darkest depths of this man's soul for his stellar last hurrah, and not a single note of the entire recording goes to waste. Everything is put into every song, and when Johnny Cash goes all in, that means there's going to be a whole lot of something great, and this music he made, whether it be his interpretations of other songs or his own original material, is all magnificent. Danny Boy, Desperado and We'll Meet Again will break your heart. This is definitely a must hear for everyone.
B0002KQNL8|3.0|Dan O' Bannon's original Return of the Living Dead, a sequel/homage to George Romero's genre setting Night of the Living Dead, was loaded with dark humor yet fused with plenty of horror elements and imagination which made it an instant classic.  A few years later, this sequel was churned out, basically following the same formula of the first film minus the horror and black humor.  Stars James Karen and Thom Matthews, both of whom played central roles in the first film, are in this installment as different characters who end up in the same situation with the same results.  There is still plenty of humor abound however with zombies doing ridiculous things that you won't expect (the Thriller zombie at the end honestly had me laughing like an idiot), and this is worth checking out for fans of the first film, but those looking for a horror fix should look elsewhere.  Warner Bros. decided to include a commentary by director Ken Wiederhorn and co-star Thor Van Lingen along with a theatrical trailer, but you'd figure for the list price that a few more extras would have been included.  Typical.
B000000WA2|4.0|Unlike most other reviewers who have probably been following Blur chronologically from the beginning, I came onto them late. The Great Escape was the final album of theirs that I got around to buying, and it's certainly one of their most bizarre and eccentric works, at times offering glimmers of brilliance, and at other moments sounding pretty darn awful. I'm sure my opinions on the growth and progression of Blur over the years are quite skewed considering the order in which I heard their albums (Parklife, Blur, Modern Life is Rubbish, Think Tank, 13, Leisure), but I will offer my opinions on this peculiar recording nonetheless. The Great Escape starts off brilliantly. The quartet of Stereotypes, Country House, Best Days and Charmless Man may be the greatest string of tracks at the beginning of any Blur album. Fade Away and Top Man, however, are just flat out annoying, and obnoxiously bring the zestful and upbeat music to a screeching halt. The Universal sets the ball rolling once again with its lovely, bittersweet, balladry, but again the mood is shattered when the stertorous Mr. Robinson's Quango bores on for four minutes. Thankfully the next three tracks are all very good. He Thought of Cars is a gorgeously dark number that premonishes much of what Blur would later make in the shadows, and It Could Be You is just a thoroughly awesome song, with its anthemic chorus heartily resounding, -All we want is to be happy/In our homes like happy families/Be the man on the beach with the world at his feet/Yes, it could be you-. And as for Ernold Same, I get the feeling that most people find this track an annoyance, but I think it's short, whimsical sameness is rather enjoyable. Globe Alone rocks harder than most other tunes from The Great Escape, but it doesn't do much for me at all. And finally the last three songs, like the first four, are all excellent. Dan Abnormal is extremely catchy, as is Entertain Me, and Yuko and Hiro is a fine, flowery closer to a fine, flowery album. This is not their best by any means, but for true fans, it's still an essential piece of the grand Blur ouvre.
B00027JZ3E|2.0|Joel Schumacher (the man who ruined the Batman film franchise) directed this well known and widely loved film about a mother (Diane Wiest) and her sons Michael(Jason Patric) and his brother (Corey Haim) who move to a new town which just so happens to be inhabited by a tribe of teenage vampires led by Kiefer Sutherland.  Since my youth, I was never fond of the Lost Boys, and watching it today shows how dated the film looks.  Everything about it from it's presentation (the film just has that 80's cheese look) to it's cast (Haim and fellow washed up actor Corey Feldman) is dated and overrated, despite some knockout cinematography.  If you want to watch a superior vampire film, pick up Anchor Bay's release of Near Dark; an unappreciated and underrated vampire flick that was released the same weekend as the Lost Boys but with a better cast, a darker story, and that film hasn't aged a day.  For fans of this film however, Warner Bros. decided to give the film some special features this time around, most of which should be enough to satisfy long time fans.
B00023B1LC|4.0|Am I the only one who noticed that the \\"extra\\" begining and ending are not animorphic and therefore do not fit the main movie which is enhanced for widescreen TV's? Am I the only one who cares? What is wrong with these f****** idiots who put these DVD's together? When I buy the title for the second time because of the extras I expect professionalism in the product. Universal owes me and everyone else who bought this DVD an apoligy and a replacement DVD done correctly. And fire the morons responsible!
B000050FEN|5.0|This film is so much fun to watch. I have seen this film many times, each time a new detail appears. Morgan Freeman is awesome. <br />One of the best thrillers of all time.
B00028HBL6|5.0|Not only did i feel like an eyewitness during the entire movie, but more importantly it put all of my personal sufferings and problems in perspective.  As a believer of Christ for 26 years, this brought me back to my beginnings of my walk with Jesus and my life has been changed for the better.  When i now am tempted to get angry at life or people or going through what i think are severe trials, i remember this movie.  God Bless Mel Gibson for this great work that had to be inspired by God Himself! Yes, it was graphic and i wept sometimes profusely, but it was good for me because we should weep for the price Jesus Christ paid and what He went through for all of us-believers and non-believers alike.
B00005JKN9|5.0|As someone who has read many books on the subject, I really enjoy the way Martin Scorsese tells a story. The visuals are superb. This film depicts a very dark time in the history of our country. I think this is why many give this film a lower rating than it deserves. Don't blame the messenger. Given the recent events in our country, it seems that people are quick to view this type of film as making Americans seem cruel and viscious. However, this is pretty factual and I embrace it as part of the development of this nation.    Daniel Day Lewis is awesome! The only critique is that the studio used the name recognition power of Cameron Diaz and Leo DiCaprio to attract the younger viewers. I felt these two were weak in this type of film. This explaims many of the negative reviews.
0743243307|3.0|I picked up this book expecting another White Teeth, and I was initially disappointed that Monica Ali's story was less cross-cultural and loose-limbed. But soon enough, I found myself intrigued by Nazneen, frustrated by her hapless husband, and eager to see things come to a head. Some things just didn't pan out - the letters from Bangladesh, for instance, though interesting in their own right and a valid counterpoint to events in England, never became essential until the very end. Significant events like Amma's death were buried beneath the detritus of Nazneen's shadow life until late in the novel; as result the last quarter of the book felt like a new story about a familiar character. I would have liked a smoother ramp to the book's exciting conclusion, but complaining about that feels a bit like criticizing life for its odd rhythm. Brick Alley has a natural pace and form that reflect experience more than artifice. In the end, I cheered for Nazneen, her daughters, and her sisters who escape the heavy hands of patriarchy and self-destruction. In some ways this book of liberation reminds me of The Color Purple, but I didn't delight in Ali's voice the way I did in Walker's. That may be simply a cultural difference or an aesthetic choice, but the selections from Tagore, although sententiously recited by Chanu, the husband, ring with a lyricism that was too often missing in the rest of the novel. I enjoyed hanging out on Brick Lane, sampling its curry and checking out the fashions, but in the end I felt like I was seeing a faade more than the real thing.
B00008AWOD|4.0|I've always felt a little bad for Placebo. Slagged early on as clumsy revisionist with little new to add to the glam rock genre, Placebo's critics obviously paid little attention to their records, which have each been progressivly better than the next. And their pinnacle, thus far, has to be \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\". <br />Melodic but never simple, dark without being depressing, \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\" finds Placebo perfecting their infatuation with electronic instruments that they used on \\"Black Market Music\\", but this time they seem a little less in love with beep-beep noises and using them rather to create moods and atmospheres. <br />\\"Bulletproof Cupid\\", which sounds like A.F.I. if they were an instrumental group, gets the blood flowing, but the record doesn't really start until \\"English Summer Rain\\", which showcases the record brilliantly. Synth lines run rampant, but the groups sense of songwritting comes through Brian Moloko's subtle guitar work and androyngeous singing that is finally finding its place with the music. <br />From there on, the record rarely falters, with tracks like \\"This Picture\\", the stunning title track, \\"Plasticene\\", and the intimate \\"Special Needs\\" and \\"Protect Me From What I Want\\" keeping the record on excellent path until its conclusion with \\"Centrefolds\\". <br />The only time Placebo take a misstep is on \\"Something Rotten\\", where the group let the electronic elements take over too much of the music, crafting less of a song and more of a sonic collage. And a pretty weak one at that. <br />But that's a slight misstep(hello skip button). \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\" is an excellent record for a rainy day when all you want to do is stay inside and do nothing. Hell, \\"Sleeping With Ghosts\\" is just an excellent record.
B0000524CY|5.0|Let's face it, after four sequels,many rip-offs(Abbey), and even spoofs (Repossessed,Scary Movie 2) The original 1973 thriller,The Exorcist is still the scariest movie ever made. <br /> Although the shock value has dimmed over thirty years,no movie has ever given us the shock that this movie has.And for all it's gore (the pea soup,360 degree neck turn,The Crucifix \\"scene\\"), it is essentially a brilliently told tale of good versus evil.
B000000OUW|5.0|first and formost, the review written by 'Thor' from NY, must be considered to be one of amazons most hilarious,(albeit for all the wrong reasons!) reviews i have ever read, as i write this review i still have a tear in my eye as i have not been able to stop laughing at the childish and musically immature comments made by this ignaramous. <br /> <br />1.ManowaR rule <br />2.ManowaR rule! <br />3.they still rule. <br />And as far as 'amaturish musicianship' goes, you should check out the so called 'metal' being produced today, fully grown men beating out ear searing vocals that i could match with a few choice farts, and the kind of guitar ability shown by a clumsy child. <br /> <br />This ladies and gentlemen is one Of MANOWARS best, and for that metals best,  And as the reviewer thor pointed out the musicianship is supposedly 'amaturish!' <br />i laugh as i say this because the guitar solo called 'my spirit lives on' on this masterpiece is widely regarded as one of the most technically impressive solos on cd. <br /> <br />This album is brilliant every song a feat of excellence <br />and any who disagree should hold their judgements and go listen to 'louder than hell' again, and really listen, it is true Metal <br /> <br />LONG LIVE TRUE METAL!!!
B0000025YM|5.0|I could never understand the fuss around \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\", this album's predecessor. Surely, it's Judas Priest biggest selling album, and all. But it was so poppy sounding, and had almost no punch at all! Imagine my relief when I heard \\"Defenders of the Faith\\" for the 1st time. My Judas Priest, the band that I loved for their hellish energetics, piercing vocals, and relentless riffing attack, was back! <br /> <br />Even now \\"Defenders\\" stands strong against any competition, and is doubtlessly one of the best JP albums ever, on par with the groundbreaking \\"Stained Class\\" and Rob Halford's goodbye \\"Painkiller\\". The band threw away any poppy influence it might had and put out 40+ minutes of heavy metal classics. Right from the start, \\"Freewheel Burning\\" and \\"Jawbreaker\\" epitomize everything that is great about this music, running at breakneck speed with energy enough to rival an atomic explosion. And the incredible, arguably best JP song ever, \\"The Sentinel\\" adds up to the impression. Judas Priest throw in much variety, and alongside the speedy tracks there are a mid-tempo heavy metal anthem \\"Rock Hard, Ride Free\\", unexpectedly slow \\"Love Bites\\" and \\"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\\", a return to JP's 70s trademark metal-ballad style \\"When the Night Comes Down\\", a stadion-stomper medley \\"Heavy Duty\\"/\\"Defenders of the Faith\\", and a faster \\"Eat Me Alive\\" with some dual-faced lyrics, considering Halford's declared homosexuality.  <br />There's no need to mention that throughout the album K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton once again prove themselves as one of the best guitar duo in metal history, Rob Halford's vocals are in top-form, and the rhythm-section does its job remarkably well with some powerful drumming by Dave Holland. <br /> <br />I won't exaggerate much by saying that \\"Defenders of the Faith\\" is a mandatory album for any serious heavy metal fan. I'd advise to buy the new remastered edition, because its sound quality is better, and it features a couple of nice bonus-tracks/
B000000WJ4|4.0|Yes, I agree with Mr. Jensens review. This one is a mixture. Johnny & Edgar do a duet on 'Please Come Home For Christmas', and strangely enough, Bon Jovi also did the same song almost simultaneously and released it as a single at the end of that same year. Of course, Johnny & Edgar Winter had been doing this song together probably since they were 10 yrs old since there are earlier versions available of them singing it. Definitely a nod in the direction of Charles Brown. Johnnys version of T. Bone Walkers \\"Hard Way' is barnstorming.   There are some points where Johnny appears to be going through the motions, but then he makes up for it with the dynamic slow blues  'You keep sayin'that you are leavin''-  what a gem!  The lyrics are so true to life and humourous.. the guitar work is blistering.     'Check out her mama' is another high point.  You wouldn't be disappointed when buying this one and it's one of the last occasions where you hear JW at full throttle*. It was almost a continuation of Johnnys former c.d. 'Let Me In', and he did really well in keeping the same feel.   **Johnnys next CD would be years later \\" Live In New York\\" on which he sounds heavily medicated and a shadow of his former self.
0316666343|4.0|It's nice to know I'm not the only one who doesn't think Heaven is all angels and harps, but it's \\"MY\\" Heaven and what you make it.   <br /> <br />I loved this book, but wish the ending was different.  Not all crimes are solved, but this would have been much better if Susie's remains were found in the sink hole and the murder solved.  Other than that, it's a 5 star read.   <br /> <br />Still, I recommend reading this book.  I read the entire book in about 6 hours over the period of 2 days.
B0000025AI|5.0|Yeah, Johnny must've been drinking heavily during this recording. It's evident in his slurred lyrics...It's Raining is the song where he sounds totally wasted, although you can get the sense that he is infact quite happy and very relaxed. BUT  all this inebriation actually adds to the authenticity of this c.d.---- Johnny Winter really becomes the archetypal BLUESMAN on this c.d.  His guitar work is quite sparse, no long solos on this one but, nevertheless, the feel on this album is wonderful.   I have to say this also..Johnny must've been VERY, VERY brave to release this album back in 1977. That was a very bad year for the blues, appalling infact...disco music was king. Alot of bluesmen, like Johnny Guitar Watson etc were opting for the commercialism of the disco dance floor. Johnny might've thought of releasing a commercial type rock album , like Edgar was doing. Instead he chose to stay faithful to the blues and I have to admire the determination and resolve of Johnny Winter. Very few would've stayed faithful to the blues. <br /> The last track with Muddy Waters ..Walking Thru The Park...captures Johnny in his element. He was SO happy back then and it filters over into the song itself. I remember seeing them both do this song live at the Capitol Radio Festival, Alexander Palace, London/England in July 1977. Never again to be repeated, sadly!
B00000637V|5.0|Lou Reed, who would have ever thought the guy who wrote Your so viscious I beat you with a flower, could come up with this brillant recording.  If I'm not mistaken Rolling Stone magazine likened this effort to the Beatles, Sgt. Peppers.  Check the archives but I know I'm right. The only hard part of this album is getting thru the opening 30 seconds.  If you can make it that far your on your way to some of the best guitar work and lyrics you've ever heard from a Lou Reed album.  Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner can also be heard on Lou Reed's Rock an Roll Animal and Alice Cooper's \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\".  Which is another highly rated album I'd suggest you get.

6304479689|5.0|Director Robert Abel and producer Pierre Adidge present a marvelous look at Elvis in this documentary, using concert, rehearsal and backstage footage, as well as clips from the early days of his career, and a montage of him kissing his co-stars while \\"Love Me Tender\\" is performed. Excellent use of split-screen techniques are used, and the cinematography is always interesting.<br />Elvis looks in great shape from the neck down, quite trim and with the athletic flexibility to do deep leg lunges, and delivering each song with enormous emotional and physical energy. His face shows much dissipation however, and tells another story; the feeling one gets from this film is of a desperately sad man, a hurting soul, putting a brave mask on for the world. There is also not even a flicker of ego...we see only a hard-working guy, with not a shred of arrogance. He wears his flashy clothes with grace, style and humility, and sings his heart out, and it's a beautiful thing to see.<br /><br />His voice is occasionally wobbly (and the sound quality also has its variables), but for the most part he shines, particularly in the songs with a spiritual theme. \\"Bosom of Abraham,\\" \\"I John,\\" and especially \\"American Trilogy\\" and \\"You Gave Me a Mountain\\" are very moving, and terrific listening.<br />His band is wonderful, and his back-up singers, The Sweet Inspirations and J.D.Sumner and the Stamps Quartet, an added delight.<br />Song list:<br />\\"Johnny B.

B0002I831S|5.0|I would like to reassure Mark Alfred (review of August 14). \\"The city on the edge of forever\\" presented on this DVD boxset is the one with the original music (\\"Goodnight sweetheart\\"). I know this because I own the R2 Season 1 boxset of Voyager. In this boxset there is a bonus disk with two TOS episodes (\\"Arena\\" and \\"City on the edge of forever\\"). I expect they will include the same version on this boxset. <br />So there is no need to send angry letters to Paramount. They DO give us the REAL Star Trek.
0316666343|2.0|When I first got the book and started to read it i thought it was interesting to have the perspective of grief told from the point of view of the person who is dead.. however i think the story would have been better if she had not fell from heaven.. it just confuses and messes up the plot of what is going on with her family on earth and her adjusting to life in heaven..
B00006GO9Q|5.0|Any number of people who (like myself) are neither musicians or theoreticians, so I'll abstain from even attempting to explain why this album is so incredible.<br /><br />Fact is, it's somewhat overlooked as it pre-dates Miles \\"Bitches Brew\\", possibly one of the most loved, respected, and acclaimed albums of all time, but it's more than worth buying for its simplicity and stateliness.<br /><br />In pop music terms, think of it as the Jazz version of the Jesus And Mary Chain's \\"Darklands\\", or Slowdive's \\"Just For A Day\\".  It's far airier than his later fusion/funk efforts (\\"Big Fun\\", \\"On The Corner\\", \\"Live-Evil\\"), and as such, might be a good starting point for those who are unsure as to where they should start first (in regards to 70's Miles albums).

B0002234LS|4.0|Secret Window is based on the book, \\"Secret window, secret garden\\" by Stephen King. It tells the story of a writer named Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp), who is suddenly visited by the mysterious stranger John Shooter (John Turturro) Mort is accused of plagerizing one of his stories and is threatened by Shooter to pay the consequences if he doesn't change the ending. You'll have to find out for yourself what goes on from there... <br /> <br />It is true, that for some of the people who watch this movie, it will be quite predictable, which is really the only downpoint to it. Even if this movie does seem predictable, it is still good. However, I would not have given this film as high of a rating if it wern't for Johnny Depp. He proves to be the great actor that he is, through this movie and makes it something worth seeing.

Read it!
B00001IVOF|5.0|This cd is sick!!!  The beats on many of the songs have that creepy mobb deep vibe, and the lyrics go along with the lyrics.  For the most part, the lyrical flow is amazing.  Prodigy has some really good stuff and Havoc does too.  I'd recommend this album over The infamous, even though the infamous deserves 5 stars too.  Even though this cd is old, it still matches up with some of this years best work.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|There are many great Bob Dylan albums. For some people, it's a hard to find the right one to truly see how brilliant Bob Dylan is; vocally, lyrically, and musically.<br /><br />As a 20 year old, I was intrigued by listening to - Like a Rolling Stone - for the first time. I purchased Highway 61 Revisited and was absolutely floored by it's content. This is the single best album for younger people to grasp hold of Bob Dylan's amazing talent. The songwriting is absolutely amazing. The music differs a lot from his earlier work. This is the first time a full band was hired on, featuring Michael Bloomfield on lead guitar, giving it a full electric sound.<br /><br />My past opinions of Bob Dylan being a Folk Musician were long gone. Bob Dylan is the epitome of Rock & Roll. I now own 13 Bob Dylan CDs now, and my life will be forever changed by them. Bob Dylan grows on you like nothing else. He draws you in, and obsession takes over from there. This album and most Dylan albums are an experience in themselves. They all give you a unique perspective into the personality of Bob Dylan.<br /><br />Bob Dylan is an acquired taste. This music may not be for everyone; but it's a great feeling grasping the intensity of the lyrics, the attitude, and the message that Bob Dylan sends to his listeners.  I hate thinking of all the years Bob Dylan hasn't been a part of my life. I wish I could go back in time to 1965 and see it for myself (like I said above - obsession). It will make you think; then make you think some more; and that's never a bad thing. So get out there and experience the magic for yourself.<br /><br />(key track: Ballad Of A Thin Man)
B0001XAPX8|2.0|not only too much material  trying to cover but wrong casting. <br />Love mr. Hopkins but get real.the back and forth,flash backs  made it seem that the film was more like patchwork. <br />Sort of left unfinished   just seemed not quite able to pull it together.
0062502182|3.0|The Alchemist is a touching story of a young shepherds journey from Spain to Egypt and back again, in search of the 'treasure' which plagues his dreams. Helped along the way by friends, foes, loves, and of course the Alchemist who appears in many forms - Santiago learns important lessons about life and all of it's meaning.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book, however was not inspired as much as I thought I would be (and as much as other reviewers have indicated). I guess you could say that this book is as deep as you want to make it (or you need it to be). Needless to say, it was an interesting read with many likeable characters and intertwined stories.<br /><br />Upon completion of The Alchemist, I tend to agree with fellow reviewer Ioana \\"goioana\\" in that this novel would make a fantastic childrens fable - with pictures included.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this book is a 'must read', but if you have a spare hour or two, give it a go.
B000286RKW|1.0|After already buying this film (a crappy DVD by the way) and a few others (All crappy transfers accept for Mean Streets.) here comes the re-releases. I will never watch another Scorcese film. My money is better spent on real Italian directors like Fedrico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, or Ermanno Olmi. <br />Martin Scorcese joins the rank of Francis Ford Coppola. These are two directors who have based their careers in forever tarnishing the image of Italians in North Amercia. Also two directors that have ripped off their fans with poor DVD's only to later on force them to buy again. <br />Kiss My ass.
0156027321|4.0|The Life Of Pi is an interesting, thought provoking book bound to leave you racking your brains trying to piece the puzzle together.<br /><br />I found the first third of the book though interesting, a bit tedious at times. The only advice I can give is to stick this part out, as the book only gets better and better. The information contained in the first part of the book is an excellent prep for the story that is to follow. Rich with detail, this background provides an excellent insight into young Piscine's life at the zoo, as well as his relationship with his family, and with the many Gods he chooses to adopt.<br /><br />Yann Martel's Life of Pi, is definitley an interesting read - and surely a book you will be discussing with others after you finish!
B00005JMUA|5.0|Tarantino is famous for his unpredictability. <br /> <br />After the violence-heavy \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", came the plot-heavy \\"Pulp Fiction\\", then the character-driven (and, in my opinion, best-to-that-date movie) \\"Jackie Brown\\". <br /> <br />Why, then, has it been such a shock to so many people that \\"Kill Bill Vol. 2\\" has not followed the same template as the excellent original? <br /> <br />Picking up where we left off, The Bride is en-route to actually kill the titular Bill, and fills us in on the events up to that point. Gone is the yellow pleather, gone too are the Manga cutscenes, the Japanese hedonism, the bustling metropolitan cityscapes and the sense of mystery that the original movie had in spades. <br /> <br />But replacing those things are some truly seminal Tarantino moments, like his glorious homage to the characters of  spaghetti-western, a magnificently-concieved Chinese Master, a truly grim buried-alive sequence, and all the missing pieces to the puzzle of \\"Kill Bill Vol. 1\\". <br /> <br />Performance-wise, Thurman as The Bride is back on top form, and is edgy and cool as the woman who is out to reclaim her life. Michael Madsen gives a star turn as prodigal assassin Budd, his laziness and viciousness contrasting beautifully. Daryl Hannah is a joy as the disengaged, violent Elle Driver (her demise is a scene that will go down in Tarantino history as legend) and David Carradine is perfect as the eponymous Bill. <br /> <br />Direction is Classic Tarantino. Whereas Volume 1 relied (some might say a little too heavily) on the \\"Quirky\\" factor, here most of the movie is shot in the desert, and Tarantino's artistry with a camera, as well as the talents of his perfect ensemble cast, are allowed to shine through, ggimmick-free. The fight between Elle Driver and The Bride in Budd's trailer is amazing, as is the flashback sequence in rural China.  <br /> <br />All in all, this truly is a Sequel that is an Equal, and in many ways, outstrips the original in terms of directorial mastery and wonderful performance. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
0671027387|3.0|Deception point was the 3rd Dan Brown thriller I tackled immediately after The Da Vinci Code, then Angels and Demons. Again, I was taken in with the fast paced action, suprising twists, turns and information overload.<br /><br />As always, Brown has awed his audience. This time with high-tech insight into politics, the military, NASA, and marine science. A few parts are extremely far fetched - such as three people not only surviving the attack of Delta Force, but a glacier carve, arctic conditions, a marine volcano, and killer sharks. Sound realistic to you? Suprisingly, these activities have been supurbly written, and seem fairly believable.<br /><br />Brown has a trend when writing to put a spin on the tail end of a novel. I have noticed it is always the person I least expect who turns out to be the villian. This novel is no different in that regard - the audience is kept guessing right to the very end on the outcome. Predictable as it may seem, there are some nice twists, adventures and the occassional cliche to finish it off.<br /><br />Brown's characters are far from normal human beings, but attractive superheroes equipped not only with brainpower required to tackle an elite force of masterminds, but physical strength able to fend off the deadliest military force on this planet.<br /><br />An exciting, interesting read - fast paced, full of action and twists. A nice blend of elements resulting in another fantastic, though far-fetched thriller for Brown.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|Promising!     With a cast like the (normally) excellent Halle Berry, the solid Penelope Cruz, hugely-underrated Robert Downey Jr., and the magnetic and enthralling Charles Dutton (in Cameo), and a solid, original-esque premise unlike much of the bland horror-drivel being released these days, \\"Gothika\\" promised to be a once-off treat for fans of psychological horror and another galvanisation of Ms. Berry's career.    However, thanks to a really uninventive script and some blatant (and highly disjointed) plaigirism, \\"Gothika\\" instead descends to the shameful level of \\"The (new) Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and \\"13 Ghosts\\" in terms of unoriginality and flashy effects masking a very definite potential for excellence.     \\"Gothika\\" deals with Ms. Berry as Dr. Miranda Grey, a clinical psychologist who, after a particularly hard days' work, is the victim of a supernatural encounter on a deserted road. Waking up in her own hospital's care three days later, she is informed that she has murdered her husband (Dutton) and must stand trial for it.     Believing in her own innocence, she is aided in her quest for the truth by Cruz and Downey-Jr., and the movie rolls and trundles along from there.    Performance-wise there's nothing to either praise or disparage. All the cast members, be they famous or no, give a humdrum sort of turn - there's an almost-palpable veil of \\"couldn't-give-a-damn\\" about the whole thing - Cruz doesn't seem very crazy, Downey-Jr. doesn't seem in love, Berry doesn't seem too scared - but this is the fault of a maudlin, lifeless script. The dialog, it seems, is merely there to provide a poor grist for the mill of a myriad of special effects, and this tone unfortunately colours the whole movie.    It is those special effects that have the greates claim to competency here - some lovely camerawork and truly innovative techniques (panning the nape of Berry's neck, watery shower-faces, strobe-lit solitary confinement) abound, but unfortuantely these take over fromthe proposed tension and atmosphere that the storyline hints at, and we're left to sit through some big bright bangs and colourful explosions that negate all sense of horror and drama. A bit like \\"13 Ghosts\\" but without the sense of tongue-in-cheek.    Direction follows a similar pattern - everything is overstated, everything is BIG and HOLLYWOOD - but in a movie about Ghosts, where movies like \\"Ringu\\" and \\"The Others\\" have already shown us that a ghost story is best portrayed with a sense of the Invisible, relying on the audience's imagination to fill in the gaps, this directorial strategem fails miserably, and furthers the sense of Overstatement and Predictability provided by the flashy effects.    On the plus side there are three or four very effective \\"cheap shock\\" moments here, but the ending is so hackneyed (it's a direct lift from \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"The Cell\\"), that very soon we'll all have forgotten about \\"Gothika\\".    I really do hope that Ms. Berry's career can forget about it, too. And \\"Catwoman\\".    Not recommended.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|This 1989 entry in the Star Trek film series was an earnest and noble effort by William Shatner, who directed and plotted the film, to tackle a subject that only he and Star Trek would dare attempt. Unfortunately it's become law in Trekdom to pick apart this film as a turkey of astronomical proportions; consequently a sort of bandwagon phenomenon has developed amongst the cookie-cutter fundamentalist Trekkers who have somehow failed to evolve to the level of independent thought. (They're no doubt still mad at Shatner for telling them to \\"get a life\\"). In fact, it's become such a clich&eacute; to hate \\"Star Trek V\\" that it has become the \\"Spock's Brain\\" of the feature films (but worse).<br /><br />I disagree. While \\"The Final Frontier\\" certainly has its share of flaws -- the story goes over the edge into the realm of goofy camp at times and some argue that the F/X are possibly the least of the feature films -- it remains an entertaining picture. Besides, Star Trek was never about great special effects anyway (disregarding the triumphant \\"The Motion Picture\\"). Star Trek is about people, their joy of living and their grand spirit of exploration; this is what \\"The Final Frontier\\" is all about and it scores high marks in this regard.<br /><br />No other Trek film showcases the character interplay of the Kirk/Spock/McCoy troika to the level of intimacy shown in \\"The Final Frontier,\\" and only \\"The Voyage Home\\" exceeds the joyful energy of the characters displayed here. As far as the spirit of exploration goes, \\"Star Trek V\\" surpasses all other Trek adventures; after all, no exploration is greater than the quest for ultimate reality and the Supreme Creator. As a matter of fact, this picture touches on many important themes: personal pain, healing, faith, family, love, fanaticism, the desire to know ultimate reality (absolute truth), God, false beliefs, loyalty, repentance and forgiveness. Name another film in the series that addresses so many weighty topics and yet remains entertaining.<br /><br />The film was actually doomed with critics and Trekker fundamentalists the moment it was disclosed that Shatner would direct it; the knives hit the sharpening stones well before it was ever released and once the buzz got out that it was a bad film a feeding frenzy ensued. It would have been better received if Shatner had directed the film anonymously and if it were released after \\"Star Trek III.\\" As it was, it came out on the heels of \\"Star Trek IV,\\" the hands-down pinnacle of the feature films. If \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" had come out after The Voyage Home it would have been deemed a mediocre affair.<br /><br />The bottom line is that \\"Star Trek V\\" is a solid and extremely original Trek outing, equal parts amusing, thought-provoking, wonder-inducing and heart-warming; it possesses a wealth of quality scenes and has an interesting assortment of colorful characters who unite together for the ultimate discovery. Its best character is Sybok, played excellently by Laurence Luckinbill. Sybok isn't really a villain at all, but rather a rebel Vulcan who rejects Stoicism and develops a compulsion to heal people and find ultimate knowledge. His mistake is allowing this compulsion to assume the creature beyond the Great Barrier is God, which it obviously isn't. Of course the film would have been more successful if the studio hadn't repeatedly cut the budget the closer it came to completion, thus robbing Shatner (and us) of his original vision. As it is, the climax is serviceable, but clearly missing something.<br /><br />Regardless, \\"The Final Frontier\\" is an entertaining Trek romp, if nothing else, but thankfully it offers more. Personally, I'd pop it in any day before \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" (sssnnnnooooorrrreee). By all means, watch it again for the first time.<br /><br />GRADE: Baining.<br /><br />The film was actually doomed with critics and Trekker fundamentalists the moment it was disclosed that Shatner would direct it; the knives hit the sharpening stones well before it was ever released and once the buzz got out that it was a bad film a feeding frenzy ensued.

B0001BKAEY|1.0|I only gave this movie 1 star because there wasn't a zero stars option.  This is by far the worst ending to an incredibly popular science fiction series ever.  The dialogue is horrible and loaded with cheese.  The plot is worse than stupid, and the theme is convoluted.  The ending is confusing and leaves you more excited about getting back to reality than moved by the film.  It's trash.  Don't buy it.  Ever.
B0000UJL96|5.0|THE STORY: Peace negotiations between the Federation and Klingon Empire are interrupted by the assassination of a Klingon high official; Captain Kirk is blamed and thus he & McCoy get sentenced to an alien mining penal colony.<br /><br />Like many of the original TV episodes which incorporated the important issues of the day into a futuristic space story, \\"Star Trek VI\\" (1991) is a morality play about the wall coming down in outer space, with the Klingons standing in for the Soviets. Nice moral about how radical change can be really scary -- there are some who are able to embrace it and others who have serious difficulty with it. In this case there are adverse reactions on both sides by those who believe they have too much invested in the present state of hostility.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS: Watch out for the ravishing Kim Cattrall playing Vulcan Lieutenant Valeris. She adequately proves that sex appeal is not necessarily about nudity and flirtation, as Valeris is fully clothed and maintains a demeanor of sophistication the entire film. The formal dinner with the Klingons is also a highlight; it's reminiscent of Khan's powerful dinner scene from \\"Space Seed.\\" When the dinner party ends and the Klingons beam away, each Enterprise crewmember shares a fitting exclamation of relief, including Scotty's \\"Thank God!\\" and McCoy's \\"I'm going to go find a pot of BLACK coffee.\\" After everyone says their piece Spock merely looks around and characteristically raises an eyebrow. Kirk meanwhile returns to his cabin to \\"sleep it off\\" and voices his final log entry for the day: \\"Note to Galley: Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions\\" (lol).<br /><br />BEST HISTORICAL QUOTE: As General Chang prosecutes Kirk at the trial he screams out \\"DON'T WAIT FOR THE TRANSLATION -- ANSWER ME NOW!!\\" The writers ingeniously slipped this famous line in; it's a quote from U.N. Representative Adlai Stevenson during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 wherein he drilled Soviet Ambassador Zorin.<br /><br />BEST HOMAGE: It was twelve years before that Shatner uttered his ridiculously criticized \\"Oh my God\\" line in \\"The Motion Picture.\\" Well, guess how he reacts when he meets an intimidating 7-foot pig-skinned alien in the mines? You guessed it.<br /><br />I could go on with the highlights; this is just a taste of the many great scenes/bits.<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: This is the last film in which the entire original cast appear together, and it's a more-than-solid outing verging on greatness; a good chronicling of the events leading up to the Klingon-Federation alliance portrayed in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Although the film lacks the profundities of \\"The Motion Picture,\\" \\"The Final Frontier\\" and \\"Generations,\\" it's a more than satisfying romp -- very involving and fun, highlighted by a nice whodunit scenario. What more could a Trek fan ask for? Needless to say, a fine way to end The Original Series.<br /><br />CRY HAVOK AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR!!elve years before that Shatner uttered his ridiculously criticized \\"Oh my God\\" line in \\"The Motion Picture.\\" Well, guess how he reacts when he meets an intimidating 7-foot pig-skinned alien in the mines?

B0001UL7RY|2.0|Avril has only gone up a half a notch since last time and that's only because she's getting to the part where she writes/co-writes most of her songs, on the second album, instead of on the third or fourth. She's learning that it takes more than flashy studio work and having two older guys pen the songs to make a good album. <br /> <br />Still, even though her lyrics are more personal, the music doesn't really appeal to me; though it is slightly less annoying than on \\"Let Go\\". If you didn't like that album, I'd suggest this one instead and maybe she'll keep learning as time goes buy and turn into a decent artist someday. <br /> <br />One can only hope.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I've read a lot of reviews that say the songs are just like old songs from old bands.  And well, they are, but aparently those old songs were popular and this just proves they still are. It's a formula and Jet is just following it, and it works.  What is bad is when artists try to remake a song that was popular and now it sounds bad, don't mess with the classics.  I like the fast songs best,and the slow songs aren't bad.  I don't listen to them because someone told me they were cool.  I listen because I like it, and that's it.  I had to colorize the cover art on mine though.  The black and whiteness just begged to be filled in.  Don't bash people cause they like a certain type of music and you don't.  Anybody can listen to whatever they want.
B000003TSP|4.0|Although Trip-Hop is the best way to describe Portishead's blend of deep electronic beats and repeating rhythms underneath Beth Gibbons hypnotizing voice. <br /> <br />All at once sounding like an angel and a witch, Beth's voice reaches highs and lows giving off deep emotions that propel the music farther than it could've gone otherwise. This album seems very tense and dreary as if your traveling through someone's horrible yet wonderful dream. <br /> <br />And that's what it is to me everytime I put this record on; a dream.
B00005JNEI|3.0|Nothing can beat the 7 minutes of MY PET GOAT . . which was the best part of the movie. Except for the Aircraft Carrier show and the questionable tactics of the Marine recruiters, the rest appears to be taken out of context to the point that it loses its impact. In particular, the Army is not a Scholarship Fund . . it is a mechanism for fighting wars and why concentrate on those people . . mothers and young people . . . who don't seem to understand this.  I would have liked the picture to be made in a more gentle manner . . . anyone who would be seeing a less overt movie would still be able to figure out its intent. All in all, however, I think its advantages clearly outweigh its disadvantages, and every voting-age American should see it before November.
0316168815|5.0|The Lovely Bones tells the story of Susie Salmon's death, and the lives of her family after the fact, all from the point of view of Susie while she watches from heaven. I simply can not describe the emotional roller coaster that this book is; innocent and sweet in some parts, and terribly dark and depressing in others, this book feels amazingly true to life.
0676973779|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book but did not enjoy the leap of faith that it wanted me to take in the end. Perhaps it is my own scepticism, but I don't ascribe to the idea that life is more fantastic and interesting if there is a God. That is not what I want to base my belief on. Again, it was a fun read, but not one that I got enough from that I would do it again.
B000002J1U|5.0|Even though Led Zeppelin's first two albums were great, to me this is where it really gets interesting.  This album builds on the first two, and then some.  Diverse, yet very consistent -- you have heavy tracks like \\"The Immigrant Song\\", and lighter, toe-tapping tracks like \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\" (I'd be lying if I told you I knew how to pronounce that!).  And then there's \\"That's The Way\\", which I can't even begin to describe...it's just brilliant.  Highly recommended.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie was funny, smart, romantic, and had a great moral. Your  <br />heart is stronger than your brain. Jim Carrey gives one of the best performances of his carrer. If you have not seen it, then shame on you!
B0000027RL|5.0|I don't consider myself a Pearl Jam fan per se, nor am I a grunge fan.  But this album is phenomenal.  There's not a weak song here.  A friend of mine used to call albums like this \\"Tens\\" (meaning, on a scale of one to ten, they scored a ten), which is ironic considering this album is *named* \\"Ten\\".  Fitting.
B00005JMAH|4.0|Now one thing that I had heard from others that had seen the film was that the movie was rushed and honestly I thought it was. The beggining rushed from harry in bed then to Aunt Marge. Honestly I thought that if I hadn't read the books I probably would have been so utterly lost. I felt the begging was going much to fast for my liking. <br /> <br />I was ok as soon as the film started to really get going. I thought that the knight bus scene was somewhat funny. Not side splitting but still funny.  <br /> <br />I loved the more modern feel of the movie and I loved how the camera was flowing and not as choppy as in the first two movies. Most people will disagree with the modernization and less robe wearing but I think that it gave the movie a much more relaxed feeling. The actors didn't seem so \\"robotic\\" which also has to do with how much there acting has improved.  <br /> <br />I noticed that even though Daniel Radcliffe is Harry, Hermione seemed to be more of the star of the film. Personally I think that Emma has most improved in acting. This could also have to do with the more outspoken and vivacious lines hermione was given.I feel that she gave the most believeable performance of the trio. I also loved Ron (Rupert's) quick wit and eagerness to crack a joke which was extremely refreshing in a movie that has such a strong meaning in the series. <br /> <br />I also found myself laughing silently at the awkwardness between Ron and Hermione. It was so funny to watch them bicker and then give eachother a shoulder to lean on. One of my faveorite lines is when Hermione says \\"Do you want to move closer?\\" When hermione and ron are standing in front of the shrieking shack and ron stares at her as if taken aback. Then hermione realizing the nature of what she has said adds \\"To the shrieking shack.\\" The awkwardness was so thick you could have cut it with a knife.  <br /> <br />This movie is the one that I see as the turning point in the series. The actors are no longer small starry-eyed kids but teenagers that have real experince and a better idea of what they want and how they want to provey there characters.  <br /> <br />This movie is also where Professor Trelawney makes one of her most important predictions. This is where Voldemort gets the true power to come back and that is why I feel that so much was weighing ont his film. It is the passageway that will take Harry Potter farther away from the kiddie actions and into more mature darker films. I think that this film does the book enough justice. There was a lot of pressure put on Alfonso's shoulders and I think he dealt well.
B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin's fourth album was (and is) extremely popular, but I like this one even more, which is no small feat.  It has a good mix of song types, from the fast (and then slow) paced opener, \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", to the gentle \\"The Rain Song\\", and on through to the closing song, \\"The Ocean\\", which is, in my opinion, a perfect song.  This is a great album which I recommend even if you're not a Led Zeppelin fan.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I bought this heartwarming movie on dvd and have watched it 2 times already. It's a really touching movie. how he falls in love with her but she doesn't realize it quite yet. It's really touching in many parts. Jack made me laugh alot. It was worth seeing on dvd. Go see it.
0517220784|2.0|I received the hard back and it is too difficult to read (2 columns of print per page of very small print)  I'm going to buy the paperback which looked a lot more reader friendly.
B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta are one of those bands that defy categorization.  The band features two ex-At the Drive in members as well as Flea contributing bass to some parts (don't know which ones, it doesn't say).  Don't expect At the Drive-in, pt. 2 however.  This is something pretty different.  I don't know ATDI too well(though I own \\"Vaya\\" and I like it, so I plan on getting more), but from what  I've heard, this doesn't sound a whole lot like them.  It's more abstract and progressive, and a little harder to appreciate.  I guess the music could loosely be described as progressive-punk-jazz-indie-whatever.  It really doesn't matter.  It's something really original and good.   <br /> <br />\\"Inertiatic ESP\\" is the first real song (the first track just being an intro to it), and it starts the album off in a rocking fashion, with Cedric yelling \\"Now, I'm lost\\"  over some speedy riffs and drumming.  Cedric's vocals may be kinda hard to get into, but I loved them the first time I heard them.  I dunno.  He's kinda wail-y at times, but it's cool.  \\"Roulette Dares (the haunt of)\\"  is one of my favorites on the album, mixing speedier sections with catchy vocals with softer, prettier passages of guitar explorations (and one almost free-jazz-esque part that's really amazing).  There's definitely some King Crimson influence in this one.  \\"Cicatrez ESP\\" is another highlight, a 12 minute long piece with a long synth interlude and lots of cool guitary stuff.  \\"Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt\\" has some of the coolest guitar playing on the album in it's second half;  it really must be heard.  It's like Crimson-jazz.   <br /> <br />This album will probably take a few listens to sink in if you even like it at all, but I give it a high recommendation to those looking for something original and progressive.  Don't expect \\"prog\\" however...As Cedric said on their website, it's progressive, but has much more of a punk aesthetic to it.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Regardless of how I feel about anything Moore does, the political situation or anything else that people want to heap on top of tis film, it is the work of a masterful manipulator. The only point I am going to bring up is his film shot in Walter Reed Hospital. He manipulated the film shot there of actual war casualties who had body parts amputated to make it seem that they were against the war. In several interviews post Farenheit 9/11's debut these people in Walter Reed have been disgusted that they were used by Moore to further his own propaganda when they were proud of what they had accomplished over there and would have done it again. Moore is a Manipulator of information and that is all.
B000002KKX|4.0|Christopher Cross' self titled debut album \\"Christopher Cross\\" marked a return to simplicity as the decade would change from the 1970s to the 1980s.   The 1970s had introduced the hard rock sound as well as the disco sound.   Christopher Cross' album would be filled with what would today be classified as adult contemporary songs.   In some ways, this album was also a sign of things to come for the 1980s - an album that is infused with a keyboards and synthesizers.     This album would go on to be the big hit of the 1980 Grammy Awards.   Some may be critical of the efforts (my Grandfather attended the 1980 Grammys and was not happy that Cross would win all the awards), but most applaud the efforts (including myself - despite my Grandfathers opinion).    Cross and producer Michael Omartian did a lot of right things when putting together this colleciton.   No doubt Omartian knew he had a gem of a songwriter and a gem of a voice in Christopher Cross.   This was something that could lead to big things, but what Omartian did is take out an insurance policy - he surrounded Cross with some outstanding talent to contribute background vocals to the songs on the album.  The names are Michael McDonald (\\"I Really Don't Know Anymore\\" and \\"Ride With the Wind\\"), Don Henley (\\"The Light is On\\") and the late Nicolette Larson (\\"Say You'll Be Mine\\").   There also is a lesser known vocalist named Valerie Carter who does an outstanding job on contibuting vocals to \\"Spinning\\".   There also is a solid studio band - Tommy Taylor and Andy Salmon play drums and bass respectively on all of the tracks.   Rob Meurer contributes keyboards, piano, etc on 8 of the 9 tracks.    Michael McDonald does a tremendous job on his two tracks.   His soulful voice is perfect as he echoes Cross on the chorus of \\"I Really Don't Know Anymore\\".  Meurer's synthesizers will also give this song a very catchy beat.  McDonald is much better known for his background vocals \\"Ride Like the Wind\\".    \\"Ride Like the Wind\\" is an awesome song.   McDonald is used in a similar role as \\"I Really Don't Know Anymore\\" provided the \\"echo\\" to Cross.   In 1982, I remember watching \\"The Great American Bike Race\\" (a transcontiential bicycle race) on ABC Sports.   The person who won that race was kind of a \\"loner\\" character named Lon Haldeman.  They used this song to describe him and I remember how perfect this music was.   Even today I have visions of the \\"loner\\" cyclist when this song is played.    On \\"The Light is On\\", this isn't a song I would expect to hear Don Henley on.  Henley contributes vocals and not any percussion or drums.   Henley's vocals are combined with Cross himself and someone named J.D. Souther.   You won't hear Henley stand out on this song, but I'm sure having someone like him in the studio contributed to great quality this song delivers.   As for Nicolette Larson (the late singer who passed away in 1997 - famous for her hit \\"Lotta Love\\"), she is the perfect vocalist on \\"Say You'll Be Mine\\".   On this track, Larson basically performs a duet with Cross.   She blends beautifully in this song.   Larson doesn't come on to the song til about 1:35 into the song - and she \\"folds\\" into the song beautifully as her role gets more prevalent as the song goes on.   On \\"Spinning\\",  Valerie Carter also plays a duet role - but her role starts much earlier in the song.   \\"Spinning\\" is a hidden gem on this album - it is a very soulful and romantic song featuring some terrific flugelhorn by someone named Chuck Findley.    There are two other songs that are hidden gems on this album.   Both of these songs feature terrific lyrics and terrific music.   The first is \\"Poor Shirley\\" is a song that deals with someone named 'Shirley' that Cross describes as someone who has went through the heartbreak of a breakup.  \\"Minstrel Gigolo\\" is the six minute finale to the album and is the perfect wrap-up song.  In this song Cross takes us the journey of being a star in the music industry.  Since this was a debut album,  Cross probably wasn't writing from experience but rather taking a peek into the future.   \\"Minstrel Gigolo\\" is probably the second best track on the collection.    Besides \\"Ride Like the Wind\\", there are two other popular songs on this album.  \\"Sailing\\" won a Grammy for song of the year and is one of those songs in which the songwriter is able to create a \\"visual\\" from the music.   No doubt, Cross paints the perfect picture of a relaxing day at sea.  I think Cross knew he was painting a picture as he references \\"the canvas can do miracles\\".    The other well known song is \\"Never Be the Same\\" - this song has a catchy pop beat to it.   It's a nice song, but compared to the other 8 tracks it might be the weakest of songs on the collection.    This CD has a nice set of liner notes.  All of the lyrics to the 9 songs contained in the collection are included.   In addition, all production and musician credits are done on a song by song basis.   There are some real good songs included especially from a songwriting and musicianship standpoint, but the one drawback is that this album sometimes wears thin on me pretty quickly.   In other words, after I sporadically play this CD for a day or so, it kind of develops that overplayed feeling.   This isn't a knock of the quality of the work of this album, but more a statement of reality.   A final note - even without the guest vocalists, this album still has a lot of merit. This album still has a lot to offer and there probably is something for everyone on this collection.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I knew something was going to be different when I saw the \\"Duality\\" video before I picked up the CD.  When I finally popped the disc into my CD player, my fisrt thought was \\"how did this Stone Sour disc get in here?\\" <br /> <br />Yes, Slipknot have taken a new turn in their music.  Some people will say they sold out, some will say they are exploring new territory.  I'm going to wait to decide on that until their next album.  This one, however, while it will disappoint the more hardcore Slipknot fans, is still catchy and enjoyable to listen to. <br /> <br />Some of the more notable differences are that Corey almost never screams, leaning more towards yelling and actually singing on this CD.  Also, there's no foul language.  That doesn't really bother me, but it seems a stretch for a band who has done almost nothing but swear on their last two albums. <br /> <br />For the most part, the songs are good, but they are much more conventional.  There are accoustic tracks, one sounding almost like a ballad, and if they were to drop their two extra drummers, they'd still be able to play this album live perfectly. <br /> <br />All in all, I'd recommend this album, but take it with a grain of salt.  The band is starting to sound like much of what else is out there today, which could be good for them in matters of sales and radio play, but not for fans who liked them for their take-no-prisoners, in-your-face music.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I give it 3 stars because regardless of whether the altering done by George Lucas is for the better or the worse the Star Wars Trilogy is still at it's heart. That being said I still can't get over the changes done to Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />I can proudly say I am someone that resisted and never bought the Trilogy with the changes. The alterations done to Return of the Jedi was the primary reason. I for one can live with most of the changes to Star Wars and Empire, but Return was a debacle. Why? Two reasons.<br /><br />The first I miss the Ewok song at the end. It fit with the movie and the era of early '80s movies. Simple. However, the next reason is the real reason I obstained from buying the movie versions. The muppet guy that reminded me of Animal from the Muppets. As I said I never bought them so it has been a long time since I have seen them so I don't remember exactly when he was on the screen. I am sure that those familiar with them know what I am talking about. He is the muppet guy that came thrashing about right smack in the screen way up close. I saw that and my mouth hit the floor. I thought this is 'freaking ridiculous'- only I didn't say freaking. Sorry for the language, but it was that jarring to me. I thought 'what in the h*ll was Lucas thinking.' To this day I crack so hard on that  foolishness. It was quite simply retarded. I find it so inexplicable that it is beyond words.<br /><br />At any rate, I own the originals on Laser Disc in Widescreen THX so I am quite satisfied with them for now. I will eventually transfer them to DVD and enjoy them until Lucas and his company come to their senses and release the originals in DVD DTS/Dolby Digital surround sound and make his ardent fans happy.<br /><br />I would love to hear from others that also found that muppet guy to be the most obnoxious alteration done to the originals.
0765301598|3.0|It was entertaining, and fun to read. However, I found the origin of the Atreides-Harkonnen feud somewhat lacking. I think the problem the authors ran into was making the Harkonnens so honorable that they couldn't think up a good way to start the feud, so we are left with a sub-average explanation. Another quibble I have is that they do not do a good enough job of tying up all the loose ends. <br />*SPOILERS* <br />For example, in the earlier books, one of the Omniuses (Omnii?) had sent copies of itself to as many unallied and unexplored plantes as it could think of. What happens to these probes, except the one that landed on Arakkis, is never explained. <br />Also, near the end of The Battle of Corrin, Omnius broadcasts a copy of himself into deep space looking for something that would receive the signal, download him, and allow him to start anew. Again, we are never told what happens with this. <br />Also, when Gilbertus Albans escapes Corrin with Erasmus's memory core, we are never told what happens to him or the core, beyond the obvious implication that he begins the schools of mentats. <br />Much of the Cult of Serena's anti-technology fanaticism is ultimately not adopted, as we see from the later books where there is a substantial amount of technology. How does this jive with the apparent total victory of Rayna and her cult? <br />Finally, what on earth happens to Vor? The man must have had centuries left to live, and we are left with the idea that he simply spends the rest of his days traveling the galaxy? How does  he establish the Atreides as a powerful family with rule over Caladan? How do the Harkonnen take control over Geidi Prime and become the powerful and violent scourge they were in Paul's day? <br /> <br />I suppose we'll have to be content not knowing the answers, unless, of course, the duo intends to write another series of prequels.
0743454529|5.0|My Sisters Keeper has gotten so many great reviews here I was not sure if I was even going to do one, but figured, why not. This book deserves it.<br /><br />Anna was genetically created for the sole purpose of being a stem cell donor for her sister Kate who was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia. That one time donation turned into several more procedures to help prolong the life of Kate. Now that Anna is 13 we find out that she needs to give up one of her kidneys for Kate. Anna does not want to do it and she wants a say over what happens to her body. She goes to a lawyer, Campbell Alexander, to sue her parents for rights to her own body.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Anna's parents are split on their opinions on this matter. The mother, Sara is a former lawyer herself who has taken on the case to make sure that Anna gives up her kidney. Her father, Brian changes course and surprisingly is supporting Anna. Anna brother Jessy, is also involved in the story but as an outsider looking in because he is the forgotten child.<br /><br />Although there was an ending that I did not like, and made most of the story pointless, it was a wonderful ride getting there. Get your tissues ready, you are going to need them.<br /><br />Jodi Picoult is a hit or miss author for me. Sometimes I like her books  (The Pact and Salem Falls) and other times they do not fare so well (Keeping Faith and Mercy). After reading My Sisters Keeper in about two sittings, I have to say that this is the best book Jodi Picoult has written.<br /><br />I was immediately taken into this story and my heart broke for everyone involved because it is impossible to takes sides when there can be no feasible winner.<br /><br />My Sisters Keeper is also told in varying narratives so that we learn the story from different points of view. I normally am not a fan of this style of writing, but it was done very well, and I had no problem figuring out which person was speaking.<br /><br />In conclusion, I loved this book. It was heartwarming and real and am now looking forward to Picoults next book.to Picoults next book.
1400031354|5.0|I just finished this one and can't wait for the next in the series.  I would not have picked this book out but for the fact that a friend recommended it, and I'm so glad she did.  The characters are different from any I've read about before, and they are very vividly portrayed.  The book is light and a quick read, but that doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile and very enjoyable escape to learn about some new friends in Africa.  It is a gem. <br />
B000002UAX|5.0|This is quite possibly the most diverse album you will ever here to such a high standard. though there is filler here, the album as a whole brims with standout songs with catchy melodies and great hooks. like a distillation of the 60s and effortlessly showcasing their songwriting skills and wearing their influences on their sleeves, The Beatles is an album at once warm and compelling, sad and depressed, whimsical and saccharine, angry and raucous and far out and avant-garde. <br /> <br />McCartney is beginning to creep into his rather twee and madcap style of writing - 0b-la-di and martha my dear would fit in on any of his wings or early solo albums. but he delivers a moving and very folky masterpiece in Blackbird and shows his excllent versatility on songs such as Why Don't We Do It In The Road? and I Will - also both great songs.   <br /> <br />Harrison adds two fillers - savoy truffle and the awful piggies as well as two songs to go to the very top of the beatles' recorded output - long long long and while my guitar gently weeps (of which there is a better acoustic version on anthology 3 which has dated less)  <br /> <br />starr adds a terrible song in don't pass me by <br /> <br />lennon though adds the cream of the music here and dominates the album.snapping out of his drugs for a while he scared his colleagues - he was back and angry and more creative again! happiness is a warm gun, dear prudence, revolution 1, revolution 9, i'm so tired, julia and sexy sadie are all excellent pieces. <br /> <br />in the end this album is a brilliant album. set against their back catalogue however, many of the songs are filler - however charming and intriguing in retrospect.  not that this album would have necessarily have made a brilliant single album either. there are a few too many good songs for a single album. <br /> <br />one can see them fallin apart - like four solo albums with a few brilliant collaborations. and i still prefer it to the awful yellow submarine and excellent but sad in a they're breaking up kind of way abbey road.
B000286S8S|3.0|I can't review the old stuff on this because it is classic!  But the 3 new tracks are nothing special to me.
B000002I6T|5.0|This is going to put a lot of people's noses out of joint but I would venture to say that of all the various CSN/CSNY/solo/CPR/Stills and Young Band/Manassas albums this is the greatest. <br /> <br />Simply put, I think it's a timeless and quite beautiful recording.  Played faultlessly and with utter conviction you can sense the spontaneity and creative frission in the room this was recorded in.  If music isn't ultimately about a bunch of people or a person expressing their deepest thoughts (however that may be) then what is it about? this is great art and is crosby's greatest work - alongside guninnevere, lady friend, everybody's been burned and renaissance fair and triad <br /> <br />i was lying on a hillside in italy two summers ago and i fell asleep in an olive grove as this played quietly on my headphones - as the gentle 'laughing' segued into another song, segueing into the purest, most angelic crosby vocal put down ever - on the exquisite 'traction in the rain' i felt happy and relaxed. for all his faults, you get the feeling that there were times when he really was one of the best songwriters in the world.  often sad and angry and sometimes pensive and thoughtful and even funny, this glorious album demonstates Crosby's versatility and talent. <br /> <br />and 'Song with no Words' onwards is such a great way to bring an album to a close. great harmonies, greta playing and great songs - a well deserved five out of five. please listen and give it a chance. <br /> <br />
B000002UB3|3.0|I often think of this as the album put out to let George Martin know that what they we're going through had nothing to do with him. The Beatles we're in the middle of recording \\"Let It Be\\", but the air was so thick at this point not even a knife would cut through. After almost 3 months of recording they shelved the project because no one wanted to disturb the recordings for mixing and editing. Mind you George Martin wouldn't have starved. He had already made a name as a record producer before the Beatles came along, and after they were gone he would have bands beating a path to his door to produce thier album. It was just that George enjoyed working with the group. So once Paul and John came back from thier honeymoons, and they performed thier now legendary concert on top of Harrod's Department store Paul approached George Martin to see about doing another album. This was the result. I also feel that it was also the Beatles saying goodbye to thier fans. John had already quit the band as he and Yoko Ono had released 2 albums already, and thier now legendary \\"Give Peace A Chance\\" single recorded on thier honeymoon, but Paul would ask John to keep quiet about his quitting. It also would mark the end of the \\"Paul Is Dead\\" fad. The album cover would sport the four walking across the street John in white as the preacher, Ringo in black as the pallbearer, Paul is the corpse he's in black also, but he's barefoot, and his eyes are closed, and finally George is in denim as the gravedigger. On the volkswagen there's a license plate with \\"Paul 28 1f\\". Then later on that year it would hit the cover of time that \\"Paul Is Dead\\", but also it was around the same time that philosopher Sarte would declare that \\"God Is Dead\\" too. Well maybe the rest of the band might have felt that Paul was trying to play God, and keep them together when all they wanted was to spread thier wings, and fly. We already know that Paul tried to be the new leader after Brian Epstien died, and at times he wasimpossible. Anyway with this album I found it to still be as disorganized at the White album, but it was more polished. George would show his prowess as a songwriter by doing the 2 biggest hit songs on the album with \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" which went to number 8, and \\"Something\\" which was number 1. Ringo as always would have a fun song that kids can enjoy with \\"Octopus Garden\\", and they would do something different as they would record a string of songs together which explains why there's 11 songs on one side. They would do the Sun King, Mean Mr.Mustard, Polytheme Pam, and ending it with the infamous \\"She Came In Through The Bathroom Window\\" which I guess was the song they wanted it to be remembered by. They would also do the \\"Golden Slumbers, Carry That Weight, and \\"The End\\" would be the final song in that 3 pack. Those last 2 songs I found ironic as they knew that it wouldn't be long before they would be breaking up, and I can't help, but wonder if they knew that no matter how big they got they would have to be typecast as a Beatle, and with \\"The End\\" it was supposed to be the final song on the album, but after about a minute of silence Paul would sneak \\"Her Majesty\\" a 30 second little number. The rest was different as night and day. \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" I somehow remember hearing it as a kid, and I mean when I was 3 or 4 years old because when I bought this album at 15 I seemed to remember it very well. \\"Oh Darling\\" was a more polished tough sounding 50's love song, and \\"Come Together\\" written by John went up to number 9, and landed John in some trouble as Chuck Berry would file a lawsuit against John claiming he plagurized some words from his 1956 song \\"You Can't Catch Me\\". I don't know what the outcome was, but my favorite song here was the 7 minute \\"I Want You(She's So Heavy)\\". It was the best crafted song on this album, and the long guitar jamming at the end, and the swirly effects gave you the inclination that they were all dead, and finally the abrupt stop. Well 6 months after this album was released The Beatles would be no more.
B000002I6X|3.0|By the time his sophomore set, Stephen Stills 2, was released, Stills had driven the Buffalo Springfield to folk rock highs, joined Al Kooper on the successful collaborative jamming lp Super Session and co-founded and written and performed most of the music for the supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash and (sometimes) Young.  Not long after the success of the Wall of Sound Setphen Stills, Stephen still had a mass of songs to get out. He had a backlog dating back to his jamming sessions with his close friend Jimi Hendrix (many still not released - possibly some of the best 'lost' and certainly more interesting songs to never be released from this era) and many more written on a recent sell-out tour with the Memphis Horns.  What this album represents is a snapshot of Stills at work and play from 1971.  It is a great album but if you want his masterpiece go check out Manassas from the following year. <br /> <br />It is unfair to criticise Stephen over this album as his work rate and output was incredible - he was still only 26 by this album and was admired by, and played with, people like Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones and Joni Mitchell in this year. <br /> <br />So to begin the album, 'Change Partners' is a pretty folk-gospel tune with another of those wonderful tunings by Stills, which gave such charm to Suite: Judy Blue Eyes or the guitar on Mitchell's Carey from her album 'Blue'.  It would not sound out of place on his debut. And great emotional Stills singing on this. <br /> <br />Nothing To Do But Today - great title, nice electric tone on his guitar and sounds like Manassas doin their blues things - runs out of steam at end, which brings us to <br /> <br />Fishes and Scorpions - one of Stills' best songs. Great twelve string work (like Deja Vu titletrack) and excellent Clapton song - one of the great Clapton solos - sounds like Blind Faith. And a resonant great vocal. Sounds suspiciously like a drug song to me (by the sound) and carries on another of Stills' recurring metaphors for women etc in it). <br /> <br />Various songs on the album are self-indulgent though still worth hearing. Bluebird revisited, Ecology Song, open Secret and Sugar Babe are all decent songs but try too hard to carry themselves and fail in the process. And, sadly, lyrically (Bluebird excepted) they are really quite bad. A pity that the perfect 'Bluebird' had to be tainted by this reinterpretation bu then this is 'his' song so he did have the right to do so. Most of these songs have dated badly. <br /> <br />Relaxing Town is a great rocker with more reference to Mayor Daley (like Nash's Chicago) and has a goovy solo. Sadly it has dated again and sounds rather ranting - akin to the acoustic Word Game. But Word Game is a great song and it is not like Dylan though it is similar - this is a cheap shot to say as so many people sang in this style in this era it is not just like Dylan. It's also like Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly, Jim croce etc etc etc etc...  And has a great tune and tuning. <br /> <br />Singin' Call is the best tune in my opinion.  Quietly threatening to steal the show this is a beautiful emotional song and with Stills you can tell when he means what he sings and when he is being a consummate showman.  like the great 'So begins the task' on Manassas this is a lovely song that picks you up and rolls you gently down the river and valleys Stills sings about.  And great crosby singing on the chorus - surely an invention of his (it sounds like it) <br /> <br />So worth buying. Any major critics should really try wriitng like Stills and realise how good he actually is and how these are great tunes. A sadly majorly underrated genius. he should be up there with Young and others.
B00005JMXX|5.0|Fantastic! And all the more believeable in spite of some silly science - no way would the events in the movie happen that quickly when(and I MEAN when) global warming does cause major climate changes, this would take decades, surely . . . BUT . . . extreme weather has happened in the UK this week with sudden torrential downpours and flash floods( a rarity here) and gale force winds at the height of summer - but hey, this is a Roland Emmerich movie. Dennis Quaid plays a JAck Hall, a top, misunderstood climatologist who warms of this happening within 100 years. Politicians naturally misunderstand until it's too late. Then the show takes off with some of the best CGI effects you will see, a monster superstorm with massive twisters destroys LA(I did laugh out loud in the theater when the reporter got toasted by that advertising hoarding on camera, sorry, but that was corny!) and the wall of water flooding New York. Jack Hall's son Sam(Jake Gyllenhall) is trapped in NYC on a school field trip, and as global freezing occurs(due to the shift of the ocean currents, this scientific theory was good), he treks through extreme weather conditions to find him. Jack's estranged wife(Sela Ward) is also in NYC, keeping hospital patients alive; this was also a great subplot showing humanity prevailing in times of crisis. As well as all this, the surviving US citizens are evacuated to Mexico in return for the IMF writing off Third World Debt, you see some spectacular cloud formations from the space station scenes and some scientists trapped in freezing conditions in Scotland doing their best to help out until the bitter end. Altogether, a brilliant movie. I know that there are nitpickers out there who don't like director Roland Emmerich - I have to disagree with them - he's made entertaining movies such as INDEPENDENCE DAY, STARGATE and GODZILLA and also THE PATRIOT, but TDAT ranks as his best; and hats off to him for tackling an issue which will affect everyone one day.
B00013F38K|5.0|A college student noticed that I was a member of a Kung Fu online discussion group.  She asked me to define my \\"warrior code for living\\" based on the Kung Fu series.  Here is the answer I gave her, and I think it serves as a nice review of the show (a show that gets so many stars that clipping for wide-screen still leaves more than 5!). <br /> <br />Dear Karen, <br /> <br />I would like to answer your question by defining my own \\"warrior code for living\\" based on the Kung Fu series.  However I'm afraid that would be to betray the spirit of Kung Fu, in which Caine was anything but a warrior!  :-) <br /> <br />Warriors live for war.  They crave it.  They make excuses to engage in it.  In contrast, Caine was about finding the road around conflict, but being ready for it if all else failed. <br /> <br />In one episode of Kung Fu, a pacifist told Caine:  \\"If a man hits me with a stick, I have three choices.  I can stand there and be hit.  I can hit him back.  Or I can move away.\\"  At this, Caine told the pacifist:  \\"There is another choice.  You can take away the stick.\\" <br /> <br />This just about says it for me.  For years I have seen my position regarding violence as the middle between the extremes.  Be prepared for violence, but use it in return as a last resort. <br /> <br />In another episode, an elder in the Shaolin temple told Caine:  \\"Avoid before check.  Check before hurt.  Hurt before maim.  Maim before kill.\\" <br /> <br />I love Kung Fu! <br /> <br />My philosophy is Libertarian.  It meshes perfectly with the avoidance of extremes mentioned above.  Libertarians, like me, are not extremists: <br /> <br />* We are not anarchists. <br />* But we are not socialists, communists, nor are we in favor any other big government system that uses force to get what its followers want. <br /> <br />Libertarians prefer the force of government only as a last resort.  Only to prosecute real crime, and defend our land against blatant aggression. <br /> <br />My code is to deal honestly with others and only on a voluntary basis. My code is to take responsibility for my existence, and not blame others when I don't get what I want. My code is to avoid the use of force whenever possible. But my code also includes being ready if some bully insists on attacking. <br /> <br />The road to peace is through strength and self-discipline.  America's leaders have the strength.  It's a shame they have no self-discipline. <br /> <br />At an earlier time, America was the proving ground for Libertarian ideas.  Despite America's 3 great mistakes (slavery, women's oppression, and poor treatment of Native Americans), this country proved that peace, freedom and prosperity were possible for every free person.  We led the world by example instead of by force - almost like Kwai Chang Caine. <br />
B00003CWTI|5.0|Magnolia is a brilliant movie. It draws you in and drives you on to its final crescendo. It is well made--from its writing and directing to the numerous stunning performances and the excellent cinematography.<br /><br />Magnolia is about our ability as humans to harden our hearts and walk away from the meaning and truth that can only be found in vulnerable humility. We would rather be our own gods. So we cast ourselves into slavery to all that we cannot master alone.<br /><br />Magnolia presents this through several intertwined storylines. None of them captures the essence of the loss and heartbreak we inflict upon ourselves as well as those of the characters played by Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise. I am no fan of Cruise, but I must say that his portrayal of the estranged son of a dying game show producer (played by Jason Robbards--Moore plays Robbards's wife) is flawless.<br /><br />Magnolia echoes the Biblical plague of frogs from the Book of Exodus. The frogs, and the respite following the frogs, offer us each the chance to soften our hearts and live open and free lives. We need not bow down to false gods-even ourselves.<br /><br />Magnolia was up against stiff Oscar competition the year it came out. We have not seen as worthy of a crop since (American Beauty won best picture that year). The Hours, which came out a few years later and took home the top prize, borrowed deeply from Magnolia's style and form.<br /><br />Magnolia blooms, not just with its artful description of humanity's pain, but also with the hope of better days and the possibility of love and grace being just around the next bend. We need only open ourselves to such things and accept them like the flower does the morning dew. Where pharaoh refused to free the Jews, we must allow ourselves to be set free--out of bondage and into the fearful arms of joy and love.<br /><br />This is a five star movie if ever there was one. I not only recommend Magnolia, I urge you to see it. Harden your heart no longer.eart no longer.         <br />
0062502182|4.0|I'm the type of guy who is always trying to find meaning in everything. I try to love life and use it for good and important endeavors. But like everyone else, I get down and out and wonder why in the world I'm here. What's my purpose on planet earth and how do I go about doing the amazing things God had planned for me to do. The Alchemist is a heck of a first step toward helping find out the answers to those questions. It really is written with an otherworldly purpose in mind. It's a story that will never get old, won't lose inspiration and it won't ever die.<br /><br />It took me two days to read about Santiago, a young shepard who has dreams of travel and seeing the world. On what had the potential of being an ordinary day, he is moved to search for his \\"Personal Legend,\\" the ultimate point of your life, the reason for your being alive. Along with the trials and tribulations that he has to overcome, he learns many lessons about being one with the universe and what it is to be loved by God.<br /><br />This is no ordinary book. This is what you need to read to understand the forces of nature and why we're all brothers with every single one of them.
B000005IU2|5.0|This is one of the few albums that sounds like its album cover. Band members swirling into a murky sea of reddened insanity. This album is raw, brutal, smokey and utterly alive. Whether it's cranked in the car, at home or on headphones in the dark, it feels like you're right there with the band, close enough to throw a broken bottle at Iggy. The recording is a dirty analog masterpiece. If this album was a person it would be a pissed off biker with huge nuts.<br /><br />Fun House is a stripped down rock n roll monster at its absolute finest. The opening riff on the first song kicks it all off. \\"Down on the Street\\" is one of my favorite songs ever. I just sounds so mean and aloof. The way it chugs along then spazzes out drops the listener right into the band's frenzy. \\"Loose\\" and TV Eye\\" are both equally excellent rockers. If I have to pick a song to OD to it would be \\"Dirt\\". \\"Fun House\\" is where it gets a little terrifying. Iggy's spastic clapping and gutteral screams hint at the full descent into madness that is the final track, \\"LA Blues.\\" Oh yeah, I almost forgot, when you listen to \\"1970,\\" smash things.<br /><br />It's one of those albums that makes everyone a little bit cooler for having it.
B00005JN2X|4.0|It is refreshing to see Mann back in action with a refined thriller amidst this summer's goofy spectacles.<br /><br />Only a master like him could capture urban landscapes in all their naked glory (a nocturnal LA so rich in character you can see the city throb), furnish them with a stunning soundtrack that employs bits of silence just as deftly as thumping percussions, and then wrap it all up into a compelling narrative whole.<br /><br />If there's any justice in the world Foxx should have a glorious future. The guy has incredible screen presence, it shows in the many scenes where he  interacts with Cruise. Pinkett's character was developed decently for the short time in the beginning we had to see her, I see a decent competition for Beyonce and Halle Barry.<br /><br />Never mind the odd moment when the plot doesn’t compute (for instance, how does one detective suddenly come upon so much information toward the end of the film?). The pacing is so relentlessly intriguing and the visuals so inventively stylish that you'll forget your gripes with the story.<br /><br />There's even a touch of subtle humor, which rounds off this very tense yet wholesome entertainer. Highly recommended.
0385720920|4.0|This was a good book.  I am new to Palahniuk's works and am not even sure I really like his writing style, but I still have to say that I liked the book.  At some point in the middle of the book I even found it difficult to put it down. <br /> <br />Victor Mancini is a sex addict.  He has a sick, delusional mother that is wasting away in a very expensive home for people who are sick and delusional.  In order to keep her in this very expensive home, he is an Irish indentured servant in 1734 by day, and a patron of expensive restaurants by night.  In these expensive restaurants he pretends to choke, knowing that some hero will come to his rescue and will from then on out will feel responsible for his well-being.  And that is Victor Mancini. <br /> <br />This book is full of dark humor, raw images, and strange plot twists.  Palahniuk makes you see the flaws in every character, particularly in Victor, but the portrayl of these characters are all so honest and real that you can't help liking them, even if he does make them seem like pathetic losers. <br /> <br />Honestly, I'm not completely sure that I understand the book, and Palahniuk's writing is something of an acquired taste (it took me a chapter or two to get a feel for it) but I'd still recommend the book simply because it was an experience.
B000268QB2|4.0|The problem with a band comprised of only piano, bass, and drums is that, unlike a band with a guitar, you can't do much in the way of changing the sound of a piano to make songs more diverse. That makes this album slightly repetitive in some parts. Even little synth sounds and effects that are added help a little, but not much. 'Untitled 1' and 'Bedshaped' are the best examples of piano used creatively here instead of just having a normal grand piano playing straight chords. The synth \\"solo\\" near the end of the song is awesome and it's too bad they didn't use something like that in the climaxes of other songs.<br /><br />Every song on this album is listenable, the only song I tend to skip over sometimes is 'She Has No Time'.<br /><br />The vocals are good, kind of like Steve Wilson (Porcupine Tree) meets Thom Yorke (Radiohead). The problem is in some songs they lack the power that is needed over an instrument like the piano.<br /><br />In the end, this is still a good effort by Keane, but they have a lot more potential as shown by the last 2 songs.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Though I basically disagree with a previous online reviewer calling the movie \\"sickness as art,\\" he does have a point about one important thing: this movie---at least, this installment of the two-part KILL BILL epic---is trash. Pure trash. There is absolutely no depth to any of the characters in this movie, and certainly there is no psychological depth to the plot whatsoever, which is basically a one-dimensional revenge melodrama with a lot of violence and (admittedly gratuitous) gore. Indeed, Mr. Feuless is absolutely right when he says this movie isn't art. I admit it readily: it isn't.   <br /> <br />But then, it never really aspires to be, and it is on its rather lowbrow terms that this movie really should be evaluated. KILL BILL VOL. 1 is basically a superior action revenge flick written and executed with exhilarating high style by the trash-movie connoisseur Quentin Tarantino. It takes a predictable revenge plot---vengeful former assassin is gunned down by four members of her old squad, and after awaking from a long coma she musters up enough energy to go after those who wrong her---and proceeds to imbue the shallow, near-nonexistent plot with all the flourishes Tarantino can dream up, as he indulges in fancy camera shots, witty dialogue, stylized ultra-violence, and even an anime flashback sequence that hardly seems out of place in this particular movie. Sure, it mostly borrows and playfully quotes a lot of old kungfu movies from the '70s (it even uses the theme of the old \\"Green Hornet\\" TV show at one point)...but, of course, that is Tarantino's creative calling card. (It also isn't the usual Quentin Tarantino PULP FICTION-style dialogue-driven movie, but those who expect the same kind of self-conscious talky movie from him every time he makes one should really try to be a little more openminded about the director's attempts to do new films in different styles---it's probably why JACKIE BROWN seemed to get the bum's rush from a lot of people when it was released in 1997.) His sheer unbridled enthusiasm for the history of cinema is just plain infectious, and that energy carries you through KILL BILL VOL. 1. It is purely and unabashedly what it is---a trashy but brilliantly stylish revenge flick---and since Tarantino, at least in this first offering, clearly never aspires it to be anything more than that, one can confidently say that KILL BILL VOL. 1 succeeds magnificently on its own terms---arguably a modern genre classic. Nothing more, nothing less. And apparently not for all tastes, if you have a weak stomach for graphic (but highly exaggerated and surreal) violence and have strong moral values when it comes to the cinema. For the rest of us (and I'm sure Mr. Feuless would probably apply adjectives like \\"barbarian\\" and \\"philistine\\" for the rest of us), this movie is recommended.
B00005JMUA|3.0|I'm afraid I'm going to have to go against the party line regarding KILL BILL VOL. 2: I simply wasn't as satisfied with this conclusion as I was with VOL. 1. If writer-director Quentin Tarantino has one fault as an otherwise truly tremendous filmmaker, it is that, in his immense enthusiasm for his art, he has a tendency to meander, or just to sprawl in general. He is so in love with a particular scene or group of scenes that he can't bear to cut it from the film even though it serves no obvious purpose to the film. The result is that the scenes slow the film's pace down (considerably, in the case of this movie). You had the silly scene in PULP FICTION (an otherwise awesome movie) in which Christopher Walken spent about five minutes speechifying about the history of a gold watch he hid up his ass during Vietnam, and now you have the long section involving Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) in this film. Sure, it's an interesting set of training scenes, with both Liu and Thurman pulling off some nice moves, and Liu makes the most of his juicy part---but did we really have to spend about ten whole minutes exploring this flashback just so we could understand how The Bride (Uma Thurman) could get out of a particularly sticky situation?     But if overlength wasn't bad enough with this film, Quentin Tarantino seems to have altogether abandoned his usual quick-witted, fresh way with dialogue and paced some of the dialogue-heavy scenes---especially the final scenes with Bill (David Carradine) and our heroine verbally facing off---in a such a debilitatingly portentous manner that it literally sucked all the life and wit out of the dialogue. Frankly, I got bored after a while listening to these people talk so SLOOOOOWLY and with so many pauses in between each sentence. What happened here, QT? If this is your attempt at creating \\"atmosphere,\\" then...well, perhaps you've been watching too many movies. (I suppose the overly portentous dialogue style was also present in VOL. 1, but the sheer energy level was too high to notice.)    That is not to discount the many good things about this movie. Tarantino is still much the flashy technical innovator in this film, and he uses almost everything from B&W to the old classic 4x3 frame in this movie. The action scenes are once again dizzyingly, dazzlingly executed, with a particularly memorable fight between The Bride and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) that climaxes with a real doozy. And look, I don't have a problem with this movie trying to be different and more character-driven than the more physically brilliant VOL. 1. It certainly helps that Tarantino still maintains his good touch with actors; his characterizations allow Thurman especially to shine in this movie, and she comes through with a weight of emotion that is startling and occasionally moving. And, of course, David Carradine is a revelation in this movie---as was John Travolta and Robert Forster in PULP FICTION and JACKIE BROWN, respectively---skillfully and charismatically playing a bad guy who turns out not to be as purely despicable as he seems.     It's too bad Tarantino had to be so heavy-handed with the dialogue scenes, so much so that he nearly drowns the actors' performances and muffles the considerable wit of his own dialogue. Some might find the dialogue passages of the movie \\"hypnotic.\\" Unfortunately, I found the lot of them \\"interminable\\" the way they were directed and paced, and thus I must say that VOL. 2 is a fairly steep dropoff from the highs of VOL. 1. Overall I simply can't call KILL BILL VOL. 2 one of Quentin Tarantino's best films.
B0002IU988|4.0|I have listened to this CD about 10 times all the way through and I really enjoyed it. After reading the reviews here, I felt that I could sum up all of the postings in one tag line - \\"Fresh Ears Required\\". It's not Creed...sorry, and Kennedy is not Scott Stapp...sorry. If taken for what it is (an Alter Bridge CD), this is a great CD. Is it heavier than Creed? Yes. Is the singer different from Scott? Yes. Is it worth checking out? Yes.

B00028HBKM|5.0|To all those people who don't like this masterpiece. Wake up and stop believing in fairy tales. This is probably the first time somebody has the guts to show on screen as far as possible how cruel the crucifixion must have been. Some people may think that Jesus was singing and cheering and the surroundings were clean and ...oh wonder...he probably was the first man in the world not bleeding from such terrible pain inflicted to him. Watch this movie with eyes wide open and see how mankind killed its own God.
B000286S8S|2.0|As a huge Van Halen fan, I am always willing to shell out a couple of bucks when a new CD hits the shelves. I picked up the 'Twister' soundtrack for 'Humans Being' alone. You do get quite a few of Van Halen's hits with this double disc, some bonus live tracks, and 3 new tunes. But to be honest, it's not worth the money. The 3 new tunes, just don't have that Van Halen sound, none of the tunes really seem to click. And to make matters worse, these three filler songs are followed by some of the best rock songs ever written, which only shows the new materials weaknesses even more. The live track are fine, but they don't add enough to the album to make it worth the price.<br /><br />I am partial to the DLR era of Van Halen, but I like the Sammy years as well, and while I felt Van Halen 3 was sub-par, I don't see why there wasn't at least one tune from the disk included. Overall this disk is okay, but let's face it, the only reason people are going to buy it is for the new & live stuff. If you don't already own the Van Halen individual albums, then you don't have a rock CD collection. And the new and live stuff just doesn't justify the price. My advice is buy the entire Van Halen catalog of CD's and wait and get Best of Both Worlds when it's under $10 used.
B000002WYT|5.0|This was the first DMB CD I ever listened to, and I admit that it took me years to get over my preconceived notions of the band. I wasn't a big fan of the songs that got radio airplay, except for \\"Crash Into Me\\". And I'd stereotyped the band as \\"frat boy\\" music, based on the types of people I knew who were big DMB fans. Then I finally picked up this CD, and it blew my mind. There's so much more to DMB than what gets played on the radio. They're musically complex, with a surprisingly mature fusion of jazz, rock, and world music. The lyrics to many of the songs are also really life-affirming, especially \\"Lie in our Graves\\", which is one of my favorite songs of all time by any band. I've now listened to most of the DMB discography and each CD has different things to offer. This is the most romantic of them all, and it holds a special place in my CD collection because it was the first one of their CDs I heard. If you've never bought a Dave Matthews CD before and you're considering it, please don't be as close-minded as I was: give this musically interesting group of talented musicians a chance.
B00028HBKM|1.0|This DVD is likely a ripoff! It is completely bare bones and devoid of most extras that DVD's come with. What they are doing is releasing a bare bones version now to capitalise on the people who don't know any better and want the DVD with Jesus on it.  But for a movie that meant so much to Mel Gibson, it's almost certain they withheld all the features for a future version to be released during the Holidays. That includes footage and text that caused much of the controversy in the first place over the film which was cut. I'm not religious at all, but thought the film was  excellent, however I would say hold off on buying this right off the bat. It's more than likely you'll hear an announcement of special edition a few days later.
6305910340|5.0|A cute little boy with a lisp emerges from his toy room to discover that he has masterminded his pawns, kings and bishops by watching a bunch of curbside punks playing chess for money.<br /><br />Thus begins the gripping saga of Searching for Bobby Fischer, based on the story of an actual eponymous boy, currently considered to be the world's most prodigious chess player under 18.<br /><br />Don't let the chess bit scare you if you're not familiar with the game. The focus is less on the game itself (although it sure helps you appreciate matters more) and more on the people, their sentiments, the pressures they bring to bear. It's a tale of human trials and triumph, not a sports movie that panders to a certain segment of the population.<br /><br />And in being so, it probes some very relevant questions. How important are games to our way of life? At what point does the need to win become so important that the game ceases to be a game? Has it become so crucial that we lose sight of the humans playing the game?<br /><br />We don't easily find the answer to all these questions, but exploring the young player's early career and examining the relationship between him and his victory-obsessed father is rewarding enough.<br /><br />As I watch the 2004 Athens Olympics and all the non-game stuff that takes center stage in modern sports, I can only heartily recommend this unsung gem of a film to discerning viewers.
B000002P2V|5.0|This is one of my favourite Who albums because it's got so much musical energy and excitement pulsating all throughout.  It reflects the band's changing musical direction, like it or not; who wants a band or singer to have the exact same style on each and every album?  Most music put out in 1978 was like this, very influenced by New Wave and the dawn of the Punk movement.  And since I love this album so much, I was shocked to discover that the remastering had taken away some lyrics and instrumentation on the songs, like the first part of the chorus in \\"Trick of the Light.\\"  And the songs are linked together thematically, all about the changing nature of music.  The album begins with a jolt of energy and pulls one right in until the final moment, Keith's final moment of glory on his beloved drums before his untimely premature death.  His drumming on the other tracks hadn't been the greatest (esp. on the only track I don't really care for, \\"Music Must Change,\\" where he had to play cymbals because he couldn't master the drumming it required), but on the title track, the closing track on both the original release and the later remaster, he comes back to life with a vengeance, going out in a blaze of glory.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are kinda skimpy in comparison to the great bonus tracks on many of their other albums which doubled their original lengths, and three are just different versions of songs that were already featured, but what we have is really good.  The best ones are the lost verse mix of the title track, \\"No Road Romance,\\" and the band's version of \\"Empty Glass,\\" which became the title track of Pete's real first solo album.  Interestingly, the band version contains the refrain \\"Killing each other, then we jump off a ledge,\\" but by the time the solo album was released two years later, the suicidal line, from one of three known songs Pete wrote during this time period with lines about jumping or falling off of a ledge, one of the others being \\"Love Is Coming Down\\" (a track on this album), had been changed to \\"Killing each other by driving a wedge.\\"  That was a really marvelous selection of a bonus track, on a really marvelous album which doesn't get enough credit.ing Down\\" (a track on this album), had been changed to \\"Killing each other by driving a wedge.\\"  That was a really marvelous selection of a bonus track, on a really marvelous album which doesn't get enough credit.
B00005JMUA|5.0|A minority of detractors have complained that KILL BILL-Vol 2 (and Vol. 1) is derivative.  However, this is Quentin Tarantino and there is a certain stamp and style to this film (and all his films). What is homage is also adding a large amount of originality to a genre.  Both volumes of KILL BILL is an amalgam of spaghetti westerns, kung fu movies,anime, and revenge flicks. The standout performance is, of course, Uma Thurman (as 'The Bride'). She is bent on revenge and wanting payback from those who \\"ruined\\" her wedding day and out to kill the man who engineered \\"the hit\\" on her: Bill (good to see David Carradine in a major movie role). This was a unique performance for Thurman showing off her acting and physical chops, and she should get a Best Actress nomination. Once again Tarantino shows his flair for crisp dialogue, drawn out scenes, and his love of pop culture, television and movies in general. When Uma Thurman as 'The Bride' gets in her 'revenge-and-kill' mode and the theme song from the tv series IRONSIDE (Raymond Burr) blares in the background, it's pure joy. It's ashame Tarantino doesn't do more movies.  However, as one film reviewer in praise of Tarantino's work states (to paraphrase), one has to remember that Tarantino is also a writer as well as a filmmaker.  He writes the films he directs. Therefore, it is a long process between film projects.  It might be a blessing because it makes his films worth waiting for. This reviewer is looking forward to Tarantino's next project.
B0000931QR|5.0|No se puede negar que los cortes promocionales de este disco son comerciales; que estn sobreproducidos y que sus letras son simples y pegajosas. <br /> <br />Sin embargo, a diferencia del grueso de \\"artistas\\" de plstico que escuchamos en la radio y TV, La Oreja de Van Gogh no se ha limitado a hacer un disco con canciones de relleno para promocionar sus singles. Todo lo contrario: creo que este disco est muy bien hecho , sus canciones estn muy bien elaboradas y su calidad musical es muy buena. <br /> <br />Particularmente, me gustan:  <br /> <br />-Geografia: un poco diferente, aunque su melodia parezca \\"English man in New York\\". Me gusta su letra idealista y un poco rebelde. <br /> <br />-La Esperanza Debida: En esta pieza Amaia de verdad se luce con su voz. Me gusta el cambio de balada a rock a media cancin, es potente, los acordes de guitarra en esta parte le dan cierto parecido con U2. <br /> <br />-Vestido Azul: Letra potica y melanclica. Meloda potente y majestuosa; y sin embargo, la meloda y la letra encajan perfectamente. La msica tiene cierto aire, que soy incapaz de  identificar (ser rabe, o tal vez hebreo?), que le da un  toque especial a esta cancin. Una de mis favoritas. <br /> <br />-La paz de tus ojos: Una obra maestra. Introduccin de balada con  piano, letra que transmite su sentimiento de desesperacin. La transicin de balada a rock no podra ser mejor. En mi opinin,   esta es la mejor cancin del disco. <br /> <br />-Nadie como t: Balada romntica bastante convencional, sin embargo, muy bien hecha y conmovedora. <br /> <br />-Historia de un sueo: Muy original, aunque tiene cierto toque  de msica de circo (a lo Cirque du Soleil) muy bonita e interesante. <br />    <br />No voy a comentar \\"Puedes Contar Conmigo\\", \\"20 de enero\\", \\"Rosas     \\" ni \\"Deseos de Cosas Imposibles\\" pues es muy posible que el lector ya las conozca. Adems, prefiero sobre stas las que ya coment. Solo voy a decir que me sorprende que hayan sacado \\"Deseos de Cosas Imposibles\\" como single, pues en mi opinin es la cancin ms debil del disco. <br /> <br />Es una lstima que muchas personas nunca lleguen a escuchar este disco por considerar a LODVG como un grupo pop radiofrmula.

B0000AMRJC|1.0|Scarface, no matter what anybody tells you, is a god-awful piece of garbage. From the ridiculous synth score, to the totally unwatchable and unbelievable violence, to the final stupid sequence of the film with the infamous \\"say hello to my little friend\\" line, this movie is just wretched. Brian DePalma is quite possibly the worst director ever about putting style over substance, and this is his bloated disasterpiece. Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors and even he couldn't save this junk heap. Not to totally throw all the blame on DePalma though, Oliver Stones' awful script is a lot of the reason the film is as bad as it is. When Stone is good he's really good but when he's bad, he's terrible. All of these other reviewers on here must have seen a different movie, or maybe I just missed something about this three hour pile of crap. I don't know, but if you want to see a great mob movie, watch Goodfellas or the Godfather. Not this. Save yourself the trauma.
B000089RVX|4.0|Everybody has their own taste in music, but not everybody has an ear for music. I happen to like this CD a lot, and I understand that some people won't, but to say that Amy Lee can't hold a note? \\"Mare\\", get a clue! Amy Lee has one of the best voices in pop or rock or goth (or whatever label you want to put on it) to come around in a long time. I've seen them live and I was impressed with her talent.
B00005JMUA|4.0|This movie isn't perfect: a lot of the moments in the first third of the movie seem overly long and superfluous; padding needed to build part two into a feature length film.  Although Michael Madsen is excellent in this, he has too many scenes which slow down the pacing and don't build enough character to be important.  Also, the beginning wedding rehersal is far too drawn out and contains suprisingly bad acting from the supporting characters.  BUT--once we get past these slow scenes and unnecessary padding (not poorly done, just uninspired), we reach the golden road of an almost perfect film.  Beginning with Uma's underground burial and the introduction of Pai Mei, the film is utterly phenomonal.  Perfectly paced, expertly shot, and cinematically jaw-dropping.  The last two-thirds of this movie floored me with the level of expertise film making on display.  From the brutal training sequences with Pai Mei, to the shocking fight between the Bride and Elle and the PERFECT final half-hour of dialogue and emotion with the Bride, Bill, and B.B., any film lover will relish the opportunity to watch and rewatch this as a classic.  The final act at Bill's place feels so classic and surreal, it's just very hard to describe.  The wide variety of emotions, from anger and longing to love and regret, combined with fantastic Tarantino dialogue and some quick bursts of action, all come together to create an immortal moment in film history.  At the end of the movie, I was extremely impressed and moved, but I was also annoyed: annoyed at the first third that clogged up the pacing, and annoyed that these two films had to be separated.  If you took the best stuff of both films and combined them, we truly would have an all-time classic on our hands.  As it stands, we have an amazing film caught in the web of some unnecessary scenes.  Get through those, try not to let them bother you, and enjoy some awesome filmaking.
0790729377|5.0|For its high-powered acting more than anything else, Elia Kazan's screen adaptation of Tennessee Williams' stage classic A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE has lived on in movie history. Though Marlon Brando, as Stanley Kowalski, didn't win an Academy Award for his breakthrough performance here, once again history tells a different story from what those old-fashioned geezers at AMPAS imply by their awards, and Brando's performance here has become something of a screen legend (as has the recently-deceased actor himself). <br /> <br />Brando is remarkable, to be sure. He goes down to pre-human levels and dredges up a performance that is terrifying as an unsparing portrait of male dominance and machismo. It certainly set a standard for screen acting (Robert De Niro, in his early years, did a similar kind of acting, to equally electrifying effect). But, for me, Vivien Leigh---who won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance here---really makes this movie as the protagonist of the film, Blanche DuBois. This character is one of the most fascinating and complex characters ever conceived for both stage and screen. How to describe or even interpret her? She is certainly the stark antithesis of the animalistic Stanley, being refined and proper (and a little pretentious) where Stanley is brutish and sloppy. She has had a difficult life in the past, especially regarding romance, and yet she retains her romantic ideals, seeking a tough yet kind man who will whisk her away from her troubles. She is, above all, a magnificently conceived and immensely compelling character, and Vivien Leigh---best known as Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND---brings all of her complexities and contradictions to seemingly effortless life. It's a truly great performance (Pauline Kael considered it one of the greatest filmed performances ever), and her tension-filled scenes with Brando are the high points of the film. Kim Hunter is no less impressive as Blanche's caring sister Stella, and Karl Malden matchesup convincingly with Viven Leigh in their scenes together. (Both won Oscars too, in supporting performance categories.) <br /> <br />Elia Kazan and screenwriter Williams (adapted for the screen by Oscar Saul) haven't quite been able to shed the staginess that often mars many a screen adaptation of a stage work, but that hardly seems to work against this particular film. Besides, who will complain when a screen adaptation is so engrossing and has such classic performances? Blanche's final line will haunt you just as it must have haunted many a theatergoer when the play premiered onstage. A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, to this day, remains a powerful study of shattered dreams and unspoken romantic and sexual desires, as well as a master class in great screen acting. Highly recommended.
B000286RKW|4.0|The movie itself is a favorite of mine, and I was very much looking forward to a decent edition on DVD.<br /><br />There are two commentary tracks on this 2-disc DVD.  The commentary with the real Henry Hill is fascinating, as he watches the film and confirms that much of it is amazingly true to life.  It is really fascinating (and creepy) to listen to someone say something like \\"oh yeah, I remember this, we were driving along and we thought this guy in the trunk was dead...\\"<br /><br />The cast and crew commentary on the other hand rarely speaks directly to the film on the screen.  It is a montage of comments from the Director, Producer, Writer, Director of Photography, and Actors (as well as others).  Co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi's comments are painfully, embarassingly banal and boring.  Lorraine Bracco's comments, on the other hand, are really interesting, in large part because she is one of the few to actually talk about what is being shown on the screen.  For the most part, you could just as well be watching any movie, or a baseball game, while listening to this commentary track.<br /><br />As it happens, I just watched Martin Scorcese's wonderful double-DVD set \\"Voyage to Italy\\" last week, and it is a reminder of how good his DVD commentary can be.  Unfortunately his contribution to the Goodfellas commentary is pretty sparse.
B0000YEEGM|3.0|Like one of the reviewers currently in the \\"Spotlight Reviews\\" section, I never really take the Academy Awards seriously as an indication of quality. It seems like for every worthy, challenging Academy Award-winning movie like AMERICAN BEAUTY there's something like RAIN MAN (which won four major Academy Awards in 1989): a safe, conservative, old-fashioned piece of Hollywood uplift that literally cries out to be showered with Oscars by the old-fashioned people at the AMPAS.    Well, perhaps I'm being too cynical here. RAIN MAN is not a bad movie, by any means. It's an entertaining and occasionally illuminating drama about how an initially selfish jerk (Tom Cruise) becomes a better person after he spends a lot of time on the road with his autistic-savant brother (Dustin Hoffman). Such a movie risks being awkwardly mawkish, but director Barry Levinson avoids such pitfalls most of the time, although the script's lapses into cliched sentimentality unfortunately do stick out like Raymond's autism-induced obsessiveness. And the two performances by Hoffman and Cruise, really, are very good. This was one of Cruise's first serious dramatic roles, and he is never unconvincing in conveying Charlie's changing demeanor toward Raymond. As for Hoffman, who won an Oscar here, he obviously gives the more flashy performance, but he uncannily succeeds in drawing our sympathy for this wholly self-absorbed character. We like Raymond Babbitt, even if we aren't totally sure why. Overall, RAIN MAN is an enjoyable and sometimes genuinely touching movie about a man's change of heart.    But, seriously, how many Hollywood \\"prestige\\" movies have charted a similar thematic trajectory? It's very unfortunate that Levinson and screenwriters Barry Morrow and Ronald Bass were merely aiming for that tired old \\"triumph of the human spirit\\" angle in a movie with an autistic at its center. Raymond Babbitt is a subject that could have made a truly remarkable, shattering cinematic exploration about how autism affects its victim and/or people around him, and what do these filmmakers do instead? Throw the autistic and his jerk brother together in a typical road-trip buddy movie plot (with faint echoes of MIDNIGHT RUN in some scenes), and focus much more on Charlie's change of heart rather than Raymond's fascinating psychological condition. The character here feels less like a real flesh-and-blood individual, more like a device to freshen up a plot and a central theme we've seen many, many times before. The filmmakers blew an opportunity to truly make us understand autism and how it affects people. Instead, we never truly feel for the poor guy at all (despite Hoffman's intermittently successful attempts at bringing us emotionally closer to his character), and that is a real shame.    Look, I am perfectly capable of being truly moved by this kind of uplifting drama. (FORREST GUMP may have been a similar kind of conservative \\"triumph of the human spirit\\" drama, but at least that movie was without pretensions of being something more shattering than that...and it was truly touching to boot.) I'm sure a lot of people will watch this movie and love it on its own rather un-ambitious terms, feel that it is a \\"nice\\" movie, and even be inspired by it. For me, though, I was expecting something a lot more eloquent and haunting than this bland TV-movie-of-the-week treatment of a serious mental illness. This is hardly the definitive cinematic treatment of autism that health classes all over America tout it to be; you'd probably get more illumination from a PBS documentary on the subject than from here. So, for all its mildly moving moments and good performances, RAIN MAN comes as a disappointment, and certainly not the great movie its Best Picture Oscar suggests it is. It sure could have been a lot more than just another Best Picture Oscar winner.
B000294SFW|5.0|I have to confess, I'm not that big of a Motorhead fan and I never have been, with the exception of the Ace Of Spades album. The band just never really hit it off with me on any other release, because it all sounded too similiar beyond that. However, this album has completely changed how I look at Motorhead. Any band thats been going for nearly 3 decades usually loses its classic style or turns into complete crap. It happened to Metallica after only 1 decade, but not to Motorhead.  <br /> <br />Motorhead are hailed as the kings of rock'n'roll metal by many bands today. Metallica is largely influenced by them, and definitely stole their sound from Motorhead for the Kill 'Em All debut. Other bands like Venom and Bathory emerged from the Motorhead mould early on in their careers as well. It is very interesting to see that Motorhead's still going, but how impressive is their latest release?  <br /> <br />Inferno has made me a believer once again. Not only does it have all the heavy, hard-rockin' metal and guitar hooks that the old \\"Ace Of Spades\\"-era had, but its even improved! This is, without a doubt, the heaviest Motorhead album yet, and there's even some amazing shred solos on this CD. A good variety between songs (such as fast/slow paces, key changes, etc) is also a necessity, in which this album does very well. To top it all off, if you get a little bored of 11 old-school metal tracks, the final song on this album is a sweet classic blues tune, unlike any Motorhead I've ever heard before.  <br /> <br />Even though this album hasn't been out for long, I love it. It appeals on so many levels (just check out the awesome coverart), and its all the more impressive since this band has survived well through the fall of many of the bands it has influenced. Any fan of metal, from the classic 80s even to modern heavy metal, should love this CD. If you pick up one Motorhead album at all, get this one!
B00028HBKM|5.0|I just had to pipe in regarding the online reviewer calling the music by John Debney \\"glorious.\\"  The film would have been so much better served to have used excerpts from the St. Matthew and/or St. John Passion by Bach.  Debney's score is good at best, but for a film with such emotional weight, it certainly could have been much, much, much more.  Then again, people probably don't care that much about the music.  But let it be duly noted that I found the score to be above average to average.  Who cares, eh?
B000000H66|5.0|Most fans will hail Death as the original death metal band, but when you ask Death's visionary, Chuck Schuldiner, he would cite Possessed as the influence. Still, Death's impact on the genre can not go overlooked. They brought technical complexity to death metal and remain one of the most creative and innovative bands in the genre.  <br /> <br />Death's earlier albums were much more thrash oriented, but these later ones are quite a stylistic oddity. More towards the modern style of death metal, but with hints of classic heavy metal, progressive, and still some thrash. If you're not a fan of death metal, you might change your mind, were you to consider Death.  <br /> <br />Not only is the music unorthodox for death metal, but the lyrics are some of the most intellectual that the scene will ever know. Chuck Schuldiner is not only a poet, but a thinker, something very rare in metal, especially in death metal. Ironic as it is, most bands in their genre have fallen well below Death's brand of intense, technical and sophisticated music. Which is fitting, since they pioneered the style in a sense, and few bands are ever as good or better than the inventors.  <br /> <br />Since this is much more than just a death metal album, I'd recommend this album to anyone who likes metal at all. Some of Death's earlier albums are not as good or technical as these later ones, so be wary of what you decide upon. But this release truly belongs in the legends, as Chuck is a legend himself among the metal world, for his innovative visions and persistence with Death.
0679745203|5.0|This book is amazing; it is lyrical, poetic, mysterious, complicated and thought-provoking.  Those who have seen the movie only know the story at its surface level (although the movie is indeed fantastic).  The book, more than just a romance, deals with themes of loyalty, patriotism, the nature of war, friendship, loneliness; and that's what I thought of off the top of my head. <br />This book deserves a close, slow reading.  Its language should be savored, its characters pondered, and its themes analyzed.  This isn't a beach read or a sappy romance; instead, it is an intelligent, beautiful book that will stay with you long after you have turned the last page.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Eh, hype-schmype...I avoid reading about what's the next big thing.... though I haven't read reviews about this cd other than here, I would have to say I'll make an exception.  It seems (to me) like it's slowly becoming trendy for frustrated teens/early 20-somethings who are tired of their generation of hip-hop & pop... *shudder*, so am I!!  So, is it such a bad idea for there to be a shift towards nostalgic sounds...particularly the 80's??  Top 40 will come & go & be LONG forgotten... but apparantly 80's sounds are here to stay, & here's proof of it.  Yah, FF is a \\"new\\" band, but they're totally influenced by post-punk, new-wave, etc.  And if it's becoming \\"trendy\\" for certain crowds to like them, well, heh... at least I actually like it this time!!<br /><br />Like a few others pointed out, I'm not sure if they're here for the time being, or if they plan on cranking out more albums... but, for now, who cares.  Should you buy this album?  If you like the single, of course!!  Sucha cool video too... If you want something \\"new\\" that reminds you of several 80s bands you already love, of course!!  Though...I guess it just depends how much it 'grows' on you, if it does, & that I can never predict.  But I've been listening to it for about a month now, & I can't go by too long without hearing it... so, there's another reason, catchiness factor.  It's head-bopping, toe-tapping, feel good music.  The're some depressing undertones (which I never mind at all), such as not getting the girl in 'Take me Out' or 'Auf Acshe', but this is disguised by the beats, which at times can be new-wavish or even disco.<br /><br />As far as the songs:<br /><br />1. Jacqueline - after the acoustic intro, you'd swear you were listening to Joy Division or Southern Death Cult or something like it.<br /><br />2.

B0000669JL|5.0|As many reviewers have posted, Bob Marley's LEGEND may be considered a \\"Best of\\" compilation but I personally consider it more of an introduction the man and his vision.  I originally purchased this CD when it was released nearly two decades back and have recently acquired the new remastered with additional tracks.  Why? This is a CD one will never (or should never) tire of.   <br /> <br />Bob Marley just wanted the world to be a better place to live  and was blessed with the gift of presenting his hopes, dreams and suggestions through music and lyrics.  He believed in respect - both in one's self and of others.  He encouraged positivity amongst our brothers and sisters.  He hoped for world peace.  All of these messages can be found in his music. LEGEND is just the starting point.  How can you not feel good after listening to this collection? <br /> <br />If you've yet to tap into the vision of Bob Marley, this is the CD for you.  The man was not bitter - he was an inspiration to many.  We could use Bob Marley in the world today.
B00028HBKM|1.0|This movie is false advertising. Read the Bible, and you'll know the difference. Secondly, it's unrealistically sanguine.  <br /> <br />This, by the way, was written earlier in someone else's review, as a side note, and after having researched it, I found it to be true:  <br /> <br />\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" presents a distorted view of the gospels. {The movie} supplemented the Biblical gospel accounts with source material from the diaries of a Catholic mystic (Anne Catherine Emmerich's \\"The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ\\")
630522577X|5.0|I first saw this film shortly after it was released on Christmas day, 1964, when I was 14 years old. It captivated me then in a way I have never forgotten; it still does.    For this viewer, this is quite simply the greatest musical ever made. Perhaps Rogers & Hammerstein produced a greater number of high quality musicals than Lerner & Lowe, but this product of genius enjoys pride of place as the all time best.    Call me an insufferable stick-in-the-mud, but I generally do not seek out pure entertainment. I love fine story telling in print or on film as much as anyone else, but I generally look for some edifying content, something that reaches into the human experience emotionally or intellectually. This motion picture is unique among all I have seen in my lifetime where the pure entertainment value is so high, it requires no other qualities to make it completely worthwhile -- to see not just once, but many times.    This impeccable entertainment quality comes from the absolutely ingenious music and lyrics throughout, and the incomparable artistry of the sets and costumes. This movie is a flawless balance of true-to-life characterizations and Cinderella-like fantasy. Every part of this production adds to the effect of enchantment.    Rex Harrison was born for this role, and Marni Nixon's singing voice, supplied for Audrey Hepburn, is out of this world.  Less well known is Bill Shirley, who supplied the singing voice for the one song of Freddy Eynsford Hill (Jeremy Brett).  Others, including Andy Williams, have recorded \\"On the Street Where You Live\\" over the years, but the pace, power, and clarity of Bill Shirley's singing is unequalled.    My Fair Lady is an unsurpassed visual and aural showpiece, show-biz at its best, making good use of the timeless Pygmalion theme, and like other movies using this theme, doing it better than George Bernard Shaw; it is in the movies where one sees this theme treated with romance.    Come to think of it, how can I contend such beauty and artistry is not edifying? I really can't, can I?
B000002JSP|5.0|Led Zeppelin is the band responisble for my passion for classic rock.  About 10 years ago, my first listen to Led Zeppelin IV rusulted in the purchase of many great rock albums to come.  I proceded to purchase all of zeppelin's albums one by one.  By the time I got around to this album, my hopes were not too high as it seems to be their least liked album.  I was in for a pleasant surprise.  This is definately their most underrated album and possibly the best.  The only other zeppelin album that comes close to the power and depth of the sound here is presence.  The only thing dissapointing about this album is that as far as Zeppelin albums go, it is somewhat weak lyrically.  Otherwise, this would definately be my favorite.  Buy this album.  You won't be dissapointed.
014028009X|5.0|Absolutely fab!  As good as the movie!  Nice light reading that will have you laughing out loud.  30-somethings who are single/divorced will appreciate the ups and downs of Bridget and her friends.  Definitely a book for the women!  Love it.  Funny, easy to read, short, and easy to relate to.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|I just couldn't get into this one.  It was trying to be all things to all people, and the reason i like about a boy and most of hugh grant's other movies is because they have a decidely british feel and look.  That's why people like him he's very british and handsome.  We don't want him in a stupid american love story thats why bridget jones diary is so good, its very very british, and thats why notting hill was good hes just the lovable brit, u have to cast him as the \\"lovable brit\\" in a british type of film or u will fail!
B0001FR3IG|5.0|I personally loved the movie, but it wouldn't play in my DVD player. The brand name is RCA. It's... very odd. It says that it's incompatible with it. No matter how much i cleaned the disc or the player itself it always said it was incompatible. Both the disc and the player were bought in the US. And since i've tried to play this movie, it will randomly tell me other DVD's are incompatible, even though they've been played 100 times! Is anyone else having this problem?
B00005LOUP|5.0|I'm not the largest Jim Carrey fan in the world, but this was a role that none other could have nailed more perfectly.  He was funnier than ever in the movie without going for the usual face-stretching antics that he usually reaches for.  I love to take out this movie, at any time of the year, and watch it with my son and he and I both laugh continually throughout this movie. <br /> <br />It is funny, heart warming, imaginative, heavy on the special effects, and tells a decent and gripping story that reminds us all that Christmas is not about presents, but something else instead.  My only gripe is that they don't relate well what that something is, as they focus on the spirit of Christmas and not Christ, but it is still better than a lot of the messages out there on Christmas (which is usually, \\"Buy my product!!\\"). <br /> <br />Watch it and see if it becomes an instant Christmas class for you, too.
B000002G7E|5.0|Wow. I can't say enough about how much I love this album. This is definitely in my top three albums ever, but I must warn you all, these songs will only be appealing to a very small section of the general public. There are copious amounts of feedback on every one of these songs, and most people will probably find this quite irritating. However, for those of you who do not mind an almost unbearable amount of noise, have I got a treat for you. 6 near-perfect tracks that make up the best VU album ever, and are sure to delight Velvets fans. <br />The album opens up with an instantaneous cry of \\"White light\\" as we are launched into a 3 minute barrage of feedback and jagged production. Don't let this take away from the greatness of the title track, \\"White Light/ White Heat,\\" which combines a commercial rock and roll harmony with lyrics about shooting up  heroin (Such an ingenious contradiction!).  <br />Next, the listener is treated to an eight-minute narrative about a young man who males himself to his girlfriend, \\"The Gift.\\" The story is actually quite humorous and I found myself laughing out loud many times. Meanwhile in the background, a beautiful cascade of instruments jams on for the entirety of the track. <br />If you can survive this far, you get to hear what I believe is the best track on the album, and the most extreme song the Velvets ever recorded, \\"Lady Godiva's Operation.\\" This track features a three-way lead vocal of Lou Reed, John Cale, and Sterling Morrison, who really took it to another level with this. Some lyrics are spoken, while most are sang. Noise is used as a leading instrument, and once again feedback is used profusely. <br />Next comes the most commercially accessible song on the album, \\"Here She Comes Now.\\" While it lacks the lyrical depth of what Lou Reed is capable of, the music is enjoyable and its a delight to listen. <br />After that 2-minute recovery period, the all-out musical assault returns from the first second of \\"I Heard Her Call MyName,\\" and refuses to let up at all until 4 and a half minutes later, when the song ends. There isn't much singing on this song, but the guitar freakout more than makes up for that. This is the loudest, fastest, most reckless song on the album, and is only second only to \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" as the most extreme Velvets song. <br />Finally, the album reaches its last song, but don't expect that to mean it's almost over. \\"Sister Ray\\" is a 17 and a half minute straight-up rocker about murder, drugs, transvestites, and everything else your mother told you to stay away from. I can't help but feel its the perfect ending to this wild 40 minute journey that pushes us all to the limit and defines new borders for noise. This album is amazing and I recommend you give it a try. Who knows? After a few plays you may grow to love it.
B00005JKCH|5.0|What else is there to say?  Special effects aside (except that they could have done more with the Green Goblin's mask could have been better), the story is just fantastic.  They stayed true to the real story of how Spider-man came. <br /> <br />I wish the recent rash of comic book related movies would take note.  This is the one that seemed to stick to the original story the most and it turned out to be the most successful movie EVER.  Movies like DareDevil and even X-Men went off the beaten path and didn't do quite as well. <br /> <br />This movie should be the standard that all film maker attempt to achieve as their is something for everybody.  Action, love, good story, feelings, heart, and soul.  Who wouldn't love this movie?  I haven't met anybody who doesn't.

B0001Z52RU|5.0|I saw the Director's version of this awesome film. Ashton Kutcher successfully breaks out of his boy-toy stereotype to deliver a gripping portrayal of his sympathetic, yet ultimately doomed character. Despite appearances, TBE is not original--rather, is the Anthesis of one of the most beloved American movie classics:  \\"Its a Wonderful Life\\".  In IAWL, George Bailey learned how great his life really was due to his effect on all those around him.  In TBE, Kutcher's character comes to the opposite conclusion--despite his best, desperate efforts.  TBE is uncompromising in its brutal examination on how the little things can radically alter the trajectory of our lives.  BTW--something occured to me a few weeks after I saw TBE. It is mentioned several times that the protagonist's three siblings were all stillborn.  Is the implication here that they suffered the same fate as he did?  This is a chilling thought indeed!
B000268QB2|5.0|The first time I heard about Keane was on the radio; I listened to the first single, Somewhere only we know, and I thought it was pretty good so I came to amazon.com to listen to other songs of the album. Two days after that, I bought it. <br />Hopes & Fears is exciting and relaxing, lively and sad. It's unique. Please, if you are reading this, listen to some of those songs before closing the window, you would be losing something incredible. <br />Can't stop know...

B00005JKGZ|5.0|This film, the highwater mark of artistry at the Freed Unit at MGM, deserves the lavish restoration it has received here in this 2 disc DVD version.  It was directed with impeccable taste by Vincente Minnelli; indeed the director exceeds himself by, at times, going beyond taste and exploring the darker sides of the human psyche, especially in the scenes he gives to your Margaret O'Brien, playing the little girl \\"Tootie\\" as no young girl had ever been portrayed in the movies before.  (The great film critic James Agee wrote a beautiful encomium of O'Brien's performance that you can read in AGEE ON FILM.)  It also seems that Minnelli, devoted to Judy Garland, and really a visionary in seeing things in her that no one had previously bothered to locate, invested her with a confidence and a style that really paid off for not only had she never acted better, but she never looked more beautiful, before or after IMHO.<br /><br />Liza introduces the movie, she doesn't look so bad, odd to think she must be ages older than Judy when she died.  On the second disc you get some documentaries and one of them is great because it preserves the comments made by some of the cast members who have passed on, especially Lucile Bremer, who plays Rose, Esther's older sister and who must have died about 8 years ago if I remember right.  Poor Lucile Bremer!  This was her first movie, what a smashing debut and she looks so attractive, if a little strange, and then poor thing made only three more movies for the Freed Unit and then she had to find work in Mexico, the UK, and then right to Poverty Row for the \\"HUMAN GORILLA\\" and her whole career was over a mere four years after it began!  People whispered that she had gotten her MGM contract because she was the back street \\"date\\" of Arthur Freed himself, but actually she was kind of like Marion Davies, you know, maligned but actually when you watch her she's really quite talented and lovely and funny.  Some say she looks kind of like Joan Crawford (hard and cold) and that she moves like a python, but that's fair neither to Crawford nor to the python species.  If you don't like her as Rose, you certainly won't like her in YOLANDA AND THE THIEF or RUTHLESS.<br /><br />But all in all, MEET ME in ST. LOUIS is grand.  Don't miss out on this Technicolor Valentine to three great actresses (and Mary Astor too who sings up a storm in her big number \\"You and I.\\")ord (hard and cold) and that she moves like a python, but that's fair neither to Crawford nor to the python species.  If you don't like her as Rose, you certainly won't like her in YOLANDA AND THE THIEF or RUTHLESS. <br /> <br />But all in all, MEET ME in ST. LOUIS is grand.  Don't miss out on this Technicolor Valentine to three great actresses (and Mary Astor too who sings up a storm in her big number \\"You and I.\\")
B0000TB050|5.0|Whenever I watch this DVD I feel like I am at the concert. before U2 come on stage you can feel the passion from the wall of U2 fans, you can smell the excitement and expectation. Then the place is in utter ecstasy - the opening two tracks are explosive. As always bono pushes the right buttons - proclaiming to the 80,000 fans 'This is our tribe'. The middle of the gig is quite emotional as Bono's Dad who raised him as a single parent from childhood died a few days before. U2 bang out the classics such as Sunday Bloody Sunday when Bono proclaims 'were not going back there' and attacks the IRA, UDA and other so called freedom fighters who murder Irish people regardless of their beliefs. It is an emotionally packed experience brimming with great music and moments. Music DVDs do not get much better than this.
B0000CFW87|1.0|This is dentist office music.  I had the unfortunate experience of having a root canal while listening to this no talent hack.
B00006AW2L|4.0|\\"Aftermath\\" is the first Stones album of 100% original material, and while that's certainly interesting, it is not necessarily a good thing. <br />Many of these songs are great, but there are a number of lesser tunes here as well, and a few good soul or R&B covers like the ones the Stones pulled out of their collective sleeves on their previous records could have replaced a couple of the \\"filler\\" songs and made this an even stronger album. <br /> <br />But \\"Aftermath\\" is still a great addition to anyone's Stones collection. Most of the lesser-known originals on \\"Aftermath\\", such as \\"Flight 505\\", \\"High And Dry\\", \\"Think\\", and \\"Going Home\\" (before it evolves into a long, tedious, psychedelic jam) are very enjoyable, even if they aren't as instantly memorable as \\"Satisfaction\\" or \\"Honky Tonk Women\\". <br /> <br />Remember, though, that the UK version of \\"Aftermath\\" runs more than ten minutes longer than its American counterpart, despite not having \\"Paint It Black\\" on it (singles were usually kept separate from LPs in England in those days). And it has four songs which aren't on this version, and should be preferred.
B00006DEFA|1.0|I've got low level audio gremlins in the soundtack. Lots of wharbling and fade. <br />
B00006AW2S|5.0|Vastly different from the UK edition (which features the same number of songs, but only half of them are the same), the US edition of the Rolling Stones' fourth record mixes originals and cover songs about equally. <br /> <br />Several of the covers are 60s soul tunes, including superb renditions of \\"Mercy, Mercy\\", \\"Good Times\\", and \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\", which swing and groove like you won't believe, and they all rank among the best interpretations of other composers' songs the Stones have ever done. <br /> <br />And the originals are mostly excellent as well. The US edition omits \\"I'm Free\\", \\"Heart Of Stone\\", and \\"Gotta Get Away\\", but includes \\"Play With Fire\\", \\"The Last Time\\", and the all-time classic \\"Satisfaction\\", which was a single release in the UK. (Da-daaa-da-da-daaa...) <br />\\"The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man\\" is a fun, driving blues (the guitar plays the main harmonica riff from Buster Brown's \\"Fannie Mae\\"), and the US edition also features \\"The Spider And The Fly\\". <br />(A number of the tracks which are exclusive to either the US or the UK edition of \\"Out Of Our Heads\\" are otherwise only available on compilation albums, so the serious fan needs both of them, of course!) <br /> <br />This magnificent collection of tough rock n' roll, R&B and soul is one of the best albums of the 60s, and it should not be missing from any serious collection of classic rock music.
B00005JKDR|4.0|I thought the movie was pretty good; however, I would not recomend it for young children. There are a few parts that would scare a child. <br /> <br />After watching the movie, one of my friends children would not want to sleep alone at night. <br /> <br />The movie is cute and I like it, but I do not recomend small children to watch it.
B000002MTU|5.0|Actually play the blues, I mean.  Eric Clapton is taking on the classics here, you see. \\"Blues Before Sunrise\\" (a la Elmore James), \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", \\"Five Long Years\\", \\"It Hurts Me Too\\". Classics one and all. And virtually every one sounds great, much, much better than Clapton's tepid album of Robert Johnson-covers.    If you're relatively unfamiliar with the kind of electric blues that Muddy Waters and his contemporaries played in the 50s, this is certainly a great way to become accquainted with it...the arrangements are excellent, the production is, too, and the sound quality is of course much better than on some 1950s single. And if you're not, well, you should enjoy this fine album anyway. I have a few hundred \\"real\\" blues records, and this one is perfectly genuine and quite gritty, much more so than your average EC-album.    It's obvious that some people will insist on hating this album simply because it's Eric Clapton playing classic blues tunes...he must have as many detractors now as he had fans in the 60s, and not without reason. \\"Me And Mr Johnson\\" was a thoroughly mediocre affair, and \\"Pilgrim\\" was worse than mediocre. But Eric Clapton's playing on \\"From The Cradle\\" is actually some of his best on record for a very long time, and his vocals are (almost) up to the task, although he is obviously straining at times. He is no Elmore James, but he doesn't make a fool of himself, either. And \\"From The Cradle\\" is recorded \\"live\\" in the studio, giving it a more \\"authentic\\" and less over-produced feel than some of Clapton's efforts, which can sometimes seem a little too polished for their own good.     As good as he is, Jim Keltner doesn't quite have the swing of legendary blues drummers like Fred Below and Willie \\"Big Eyes\\" Smith, but he does a pretty good job. Chris Stainton plays fine blues-n'-boogie piano, Jerry Portnoy's harmonica wails, and the songs are well-structured and tight, with only two tracks running longer than five minutes, and most of themclocking in at less than four.  Among the stand-out tracks are \\"I'm Tore Down\\", \\"Motherless Child\\", a scorching \\"It Hurts Me Too\\", the acoustic \\"Driftin' Blues\\", and the best cut on the entire album, a beautiful \\"How Long Blues\\", worthy of the great Leroy Carr himself. Top-notch piano playing and an acoustic slide dobro playing exquisite fills.   And Clapton does his best-ever Muddy Waters-impression on \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\", succesfully reinterprets Eddie Boyd's \\"Five Long Years\\", and shows off his rarely heard slide guitar prowess.    Four-and-a-half stars easy. If you like Eric Clapton at his bluesy best, you should get this supremely well-arranged and beautifully executed album right away. It's really good.   And once you've listened to it, go get the originals (if you haven't already). Most of them are even better.
B000001E3V|5.0|If you're reading this review to help you decide whether to purchase this disc, just stop here and buy it.  This is the finest live blues/rock album available to man.  It was recorded at the peak of Eric Clapton's career, before drugs made a mess of his life, with his best set of songs in hand, at the peak of Rock 'n Roll's most illustrious era.  The only drawback is that he isn't playing with the most accomplished bandmates he ever assembled, but when you're competing with the likes of Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker, and Steve Winwood, what do you expect? <br /> <br />Six of the tracks included on 'Live At the Fillmore' are the same tracks that were originally made available on vinyl in the early 1970's on the 'In Concert' double-LP.  The band played four shows over two nights at the Fillmore East (rumor has it the band was not aware that recordings were being made), so alternate takes of the remaining three songs from 'In Concert', 'Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad', 'Tell the Truth' and 'Let It Rain' are offered on 'Live At the Fillmore'.  I assume this was done to protect the integrity of the 'In Concert' discs, which are still highly valued because the concensus is that the takes of these three songs on 'Live At the Fillmore' are of lesser quality.  Nothing is wrong with the alternate recordings, but the 'chemistry' seems less vibrant than on 'In Concert'.  Small things can be noted, such as Bobby Whitlock's chiming piano on 'Tell the Truth' being much less prominent, but for the most part the discrepencies are intangible, and perhaps a matter of taste.  On the upside, the 'Live At the Fillmore' discs offer 4 songs that are not offered on 'In Concert'.  One wonders what other gems lie in the vault... <br /> <br />The biggest problem you'll encounter with this two-disc collection is figuring out which one to slide into the player first.  Each is a great mix of rock and blues.  On disc one we open with the firry 'Got To Get Better In a Little While' and 'Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad'.  More than their titles are lengthy, with running times of 13:52 and 14:49 respectively.  Needless to say, there is a wealth of wonderful wah-pedal guitar heroics from Clapton on every song.  'Key To the Highway' follows, and along with track 5, a cover of Billy Myles' 'Have You Ever Loved a Woman', wanders into some deep blues territory.  The joyously rocking 'Blues Power' adds another 10:31 of serious jamming, and 'Bottle of Red Wine' closes the first disc out on another 'high' note. <br /> <br />Disc two offers more mid-tempo fare, including 'Tell the Truth', 'Roll It Over', and even the encore, 'Crossroads', which Clapton frequently rides like a jet train.  The only true blues number is a cover of Jimmy Cox's 'Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out'.  'Little Wing', though a great number, is owned by Jimi Hendrix, and so any cover of that is bound to pale in comparison, and Clapton's does.  'Roll It Over' is bound up in funky sensuality, while in contrast 'Presence of the Lord' is high-minded spirituality.  No wonder Eric turned to drugs.  An eighteen minute-plus version of 'Let It Rain' completes disc two, with Jim Gordon offering the requisite (given the year was 1970) drum solo.  Despite all the great songs included here, 'Let It Rain', which reached number 48 in 1972, is the only charting song (and it obviously wasn't this lengthy version) performed. <br /> <br />Derek and the Domino's were short-lived, offering only two albums in the early 1970's, not including their stints with George Harrison on 'All Things Must Pass' and 'The Concert For Bangla Desh'.  Their limited output however is like the flash of a camera.  This moment of illumination should not to be missed, as it is the closest thing to perfection a soundboard at a rock concert has ever captured. <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|Yes, you may think it blasphemous, but it is true...Keane are head and shoulders above the famous Trinity of UK-moodsters.  I am actually not a huge fan of male vocalists anyways, but these guys have really hit the nail on the head.  Sounds like A-ha, ELO and Radiohead gave birth to a beautiful baby. Bands like Franz Ferdinand are getting popular, so I guess it is not a big surprise that VH1 has been playing Keane.  But, this is the real deal, and these guys write amazing stuff.   <br /> <br />Keane's songs are moody, but so melodic and informed with tons of emotion.  I haven't heard anything this good since Casey Stratton's debut. Vocals are superior too.  BUY IT NOW are be sad forever :-)
B0001IN0DA|4.0|Honestly, what can you say about Wrestlemania?  Well hear are a few thoughts on WM XX. <br /> <br />1. The John Cena v. Big Show match - 3 out of 5. Got to give props to Cena.  Put on a heck of a show although it could have been a little more faster pace.  What do expect though wrestling against the Big Show. <br /> <br />2. Rock/Sock Connection v. Evolution - 3.9 out of 5.  Only reason I'm giving it this rating is because I'm sick of the Rock!  I'm surprised the match last as long as it did with three members of Evolution involved.  Sidenote: Ric Flair is still the greatest ring general there is! <br /> <br />3. Christian v. Jericho - 4 out of 5.  I like these guys for one reason and one reason only - pacing!  These two guys can really get you involved in the match.  Plus the ending was a classic! <br /> <br />4.  First ever Playboy evening gown match - I can't even rate this one.  Sorry everyone!  The only thing good that came out of this one was they left the ring.  Sorry Guys! <br /> <br />5.  Interpromotional match - Goldberg v Lesner w/Austin as Special Referee.  In all my years of studying, reviewing, and just loving this brand of entertainment.  I can honestly say this was the biggest piece of CRAP I have ever watched!  If I could give a negative rating for this match I would.  The more I think about it I would actually give the evening gown match a 5 out of 5 if I had just these two matches to rate!   <br /> <br />6.  The Undertaked v Kane - 4.9 out of 5.  If you didn't love the return of the \\"Deadman,\\"  you just don't understand.  The only reason I gave it a 4.9 was I wanted a coffin out there.  Much Respect to the Undertaker for staying perfect at WM. <br /> <br />7.  WWE Champsionship  Eddie Guerrero v. Kurt Angle - 4 out of 5.  What can you say about this match?  Latino Heat showed up to bring the belt back home and \\"Your Olympic Hero\\" came to fight.  This match ranks up there as one of my favorite WM moments and matches.  Props to these 2 Superstars! <br /> <br />8.  Triple Threat  Benoit v. Michaels v. Triple H - 5 out of 5.  The main event at any show should take your breath away and this one did not disappoint.   To see these guys go at like they did in a history making event was huge.  Huge Props to these 3 and Huge Props to Eddie Guerrero for showing unity to his best friend! <br /> <br />Overall I would definetly give this Wrestlemania a 4 out of 5 stars with a slight hestitation about a couple of the matches.  A definite owner for Wrestlemani fans!
B0000027RL|5.0|This album sums up the genre of music I adore.  Pearl Jam, along wtih Nirvana, got rid of that awful hair/pop/metal nonsense and gave the world a taste of something new, GRUNGE.  The minute I heard the song Jeremy, I knew I must find the album that it came off of.  I love this album, I love Eddie Vedder's voice, and I think it's one of rock's most unique voices ever to be heard.  I love the sound Pearl Jam puts out, with their hard riffs, to the more mellow smoothe side of grunge.  Overall, great album, great band, check it out.
B000268QB2|5.0|I am a big fan of Brit pop and Keane definitely released the best CD so far in that category. They have more personality than Starsailor and even the latest Oasis. Yeah, they sound a lot like Coldplay, but the fact that the piano is at the center of their music conveys a whole different mood, not the desperation of Clocks or the sadness of Yellow, but a vague sense of melancholy that navigates through the whole CD. This is a CD you cannot not love. Just the kind of enjoyable, yet smart music we all need in our collections
0679735259|5.0|The style is not for some tastes, but those people may learn about Vietnam elsewhere: there are many excellent straight histories out there.  Parts disorienting, parts addled and charged, all brilliant.  Frequent acronyms to this or that combat unit - ARVN, NVA, etc., sporadic names of military issue and weapons and vehicles.  Spans times and places... there is little continuity, there is little narrative causality: what lead to Khe Sanh?  What was the Tet Offensive?  These questions are beside the point. <br /> <br />Herr gives a story of jangled nerves and madness, the crazy community of grunts who had no idea why they were there.  Vietnam was a complete and utter mistake - it's wretchedly sad to read about it, years later, never having a stake in it.  Vietnam was a disaster, senseless and wasteful, the product of failed ideology and a string of a thousand mistakes, a sinkhole.  This book is not supposed to make sense.  When you were on the ground, getting shelled, getting killed, there was no way it made sense.  It was nightmare and should be remembered.  Michael Herr did his job in helping us remember, often with startling insight, dark clarity, passion, terror, and grim humor.  It is proper there are history books out there with dates and places; it is proper there is also this twisted, tortured book.
0345457684|4.0|This seemed very much like a Mike Hammer pulp fiction story which takes place in an unusual setting. You've got the same kind of grim metaphors (the rain sluiced down from the low grey clouds like warm spit, etc.), interviewing the suspects, and the sorting out of many obscure clues until the flash of intuition strikes. Meanwhile everyone is out to get our hero, who perseveres through sheer determination and the desire for revenge, and everyone gets their comeuppance at the end. Highly formulaic. <br /> <br />But I enjoyed some of the flights of imagination. In one sequence the detective is tortured in virtual reality, but they put him in the body of a woman there because females have more nerve endings or something. Plus he had his period, hehe.
B0002IU988|1.0|Mayfield Four singer/guitarist Myles Kennedy couldn't sing with his previous band (or write good music) so why does he think he can now?  For the review that states he wants to hit the notes... well maybe he does \\"want to\\" but that in no way means he can!  The guy can't sing!  I haven't heard more off key notes, tweaks in the voice, or gurgling since Cherone tried to become the next Halen vocalist.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|I've always liked this band ever since the video of \\"Burning Down the House\\" came out on MTV.  I have the Vaseline in the Sand set, but it's a little too much to listen to in one sitting for me....this looks like a definitive 1-disk set.  Anyone who loves the Talking Heads should get it.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I saw this movie because *everyone* was talking about it.  I was expecting a comedy, like everyone says it is, and I went away feeling stupid.  It made me feel like its movie more geared towards the upper class.   <br />I felt stupid.  I honestly think this is a movie not everyone can apprieciate.  It makes me sad, because its not often I don't like a movie and I wanted desperately to like this movie.  Maybe I was trying too hard to like it.    <br />Overall, it plays like Elephant long scenes, hardly any dialogue, and detailed character protrayal.  Except, I just was bored with this.  There, similarly to Elephant, is simply no plot.  However, that was intended on that film, and it just doesn't make sense with this one.  At least not for me.
B00004TH6O|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age's second album, Rated R, isn't quite as good as their debut or Songs For The Deaf, the third album, but it's still an alright CD. The self-titled debut was much more innovative and groundbreaking than Rated R, and SFTD is much heavier and flows a little better. However, there is a much wider variety of music on here than on either the debut or SFTD, ranging from the hard rock of Feel Good Hit of the Summer and Tension Head, to the instrumental Lightning Song. There's even some humor, especially in Feel Good Hit of the Summer and Quick And To the Pointless. There is some amazing instrument and song-writing here. The songs and my reviews for each:    1) Feel Good Hit of The Summer (8/10): Simple but effective guitar riff. This song is just a list of drugs repeated over and over again, and it's pretty funny, though repetitive.    2) The Lost Art of Keeping A Secret (10/10): After \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\" comes a more serious song. The guitars are much better than the preceeding song, and the bass and drumming is amazing. It's all-around excellent work. A very memnorable song, this is probably my second favorite on the CD.     3) Leg of Lamb (8/10): This song is hard to explain. It has cool-sounding guitars with great vocals and lyrics. It's a little too short, and ends kind of suddenly. It's still pretty good.    4) Autopilot (8/10): Nick Oliveri is on vocals, showing that he's not always a screaming maniac and actually has a good singing voice. This song is good, but it's a little too slow, and nothing really stands out here.    5) Better Living Through Chemistry (10/10): My favorite on the CD. The middle is basically instrumental, and the beginning and end really rock. An excellent song all the way through, with great guitars, bass, drumming and vocals. This song is an epic, and everything about it is perfect.    6) Monsters In the Parasol (10/10): This song has funny lyrics. It sounds like it's about getting high. The guitars are prettysimple, but still sound great. The drumming is also very good. This song never gets old. Unfortunately, the chorus is terrible!     7) Quick And To The Pointless (5/10): Quick? Yes. Pointless? Yes. In my opinion, this song is just filler. However, it's still pretty funny, with Nick Oliveri on vocals, but I still usually skip over it.    8) In The Fade (7/10): A slow, soulful song with Mark Lanegan on vocals. As with \\"Autopilot,\\" it's a little TOO slow, and there's no real high point. I just never really liked this song. It's still well-written, and I'm sure many people will like it.    9) Tension Head (9/10): Very heavy, this song is pure hard rock. It grabs a hold of you and never lets go. The guitars and drumming are amazing, and Nick Oliveri is great on vocals.     10) Lightning Song (10/10): An instrumental song with a 12-string guitar, a piano, and great percussion. Awesome, even though there's no singing. It's a good interlude between the heavy songs \\"Tension Head\\" and \\"I Think I Lost My Headache.\\"    11) I Think I Lost My Headache (8/10): Another heavy song with great bass and drumming. The vocals are amazing, and the chorus is the best one on the whole CD. The only thing about this song I don't like is the end, when just horns play, very loudly, for the last three minutes. It gets pretty old after a while, and it's hard for me to listen to the entire eight minutes and 40 seconds of this song. Besides that, this song is an excellent closer. But who knows, maybe everyone else will like the end.     OVERALL: 94/110, 85.45%    As you can see, although this is a great album, it can't hold a candle to the self-titled debut, which I think is the best CD ever. That's not saying that Rated R is at all disappointing, but it falls a little short. Rated R has more experimentation thatn the self-titled or Songs For The Deaf, and there are still some excellent songs on here. I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who calls him or herself a Queens of the Stone Age fan.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Oddly enough (considering the title I've chosen) I am not going to write a scathing \\"review\\" of something I've yet to see. Instead I'm going to praise the genius behind the original idea that became Star Wars. <br /> <br />There is just something about that 1977 movie that's just indescribable. It's as though it was concieved with superior style and substance. One wonders where the talent that characterized this seminal work of fiction has gone. <br /> <br />When I make such a comment I'm not considering the remarkable achivements in visual imagery that characterize the new Star Wars movies - in my view they are unparalleled. What I'm refering to is the genius that gave us a timeless tale of a struggle between good and evil - which is to be released for the first time in DVD format. <br /> <br />To me it's almost as if the original Star Wars was based on something else other than the story Lucas is trying to peddle now. It wouldn't surprise me to discover that some unsung writer created a magnum opus about war in heaven, to be portrayed in a revolutionary narrative style, only to have it pilfered by Francis Ford Coppella and handed to his protege George Lucas in 1973. Hollywood has always been exploitative of true sources of talent and frequently writer directors come unstuck when those wells dry up (e.g. The Matrix sequels). Please forgive me Mr. Lucas if I misjudge the situation. <br /> <br />Thus there is a discontinuity in the quality of the story, in addition to the fact that the Star Wars Saga is basically being told through the antichrist eyes of a rebellious faction Lucas has wrongly named Jedi (beloved of God). You guessed it. The Emeperor is supposed to be the analaog of God, Anakin (the chosen one, born of the midiclorians) is supposed to be Jesus and I'm sure you can work the rest out for yourself (considering Luke is named Luke). <br /> <br />Nevertheless, these movies make for a unique and exciting series of adventures that retain the merits of the original vision behind them, regardless of any clumsy tinkering that may take place and especially when you comprehend what they are (and were) actually supposed to mean. At least then you can understand why the prequels seem tacked on to the originals. <br /> <br />In any event, watching these movies in French or Spanish could be a useful way for those who know the lines to pick up a new language.
076790592X|5.0|This book is powerful and insightful all in one. It is amazing how Mitch Album, author and acclaimed sports columnist, blends all of the moral lessons that our parents try to teach us into this one piece of art. <br />This one of the best books I have ever read, and the lessons that are learned from it will be taken to the grave with many whoses lives this book has touched.
B00029LNHS|3.0|<br />I heard the Hey Mama song on the radio and decided to buy this CD and listen to the song non stop because I liked it and the radio didn't play it enough. But I was disappointed. The extra tracks version has a sort of watered down version of the song that's not as good as the original version. Also, a lot of the songs on here are too uneventful and inconsistent. To add even more disappointment, the bonus track was just a barely changed version of Let's Get Retarded (they only changed the let's get retarded part to let's get it started) and that's it. The other songs are pretty good, especially Anxiety with Papa Roach. Hands Up is good too but the rest of the songs are kinda annoying. I wish I would've gotten the original version but this is fine for now.
B0000640S3|1.0|Me and Rambo are so much alike, before I ever saw this movie, I would usually say \\"Yes I fired few shots from my ass\\".  I think somebody stoled this phrase from me and I know the guy who did it <br />Rambo. Uncut virsion actually says above line not what they show in the movie.  Oh yeah this movie is so silly, those people who played freedom fighters are so funny and stupid, I like when one of them asks Rambo, \\"What's a football, you play for a food\\"? My answer would be yes you stinking muharajee.  Throughout the movie I just wanted to guide those russian choppers to these \\"freedom fighters\\".  Yeah Rambo is an idiot, this stupid country thinks it could control everybody and act like Rambo as an answer to every problem, listen to what I say to that \\"I fired a few shots from my ass\\". It gets better, when Rambo comes to Afganistan he says I'm no tourist with a straight face, I laughed till I pooped. Throughout this movie I dropped my pants many times to moon those freedom fighters, they can't even build a school but they can run around like goats all day long and fight <br />Those people who play Afganeese look like italians without suits hahahaha.  I liked when russian soldier was dragging one of the afganeese by his hair, it turned out to be a lesson in ethics, the only language those muharajees understand. After, helping those people Rambo deserves a special treatment from russian tanks, russians should of tied his arms to one tank and his legs to another and start driving in different directions, see how tough he is... yes this movie taught us a great lessons - nothing
185984054X|5.0|It would be an interesting exercise to have two people, whose perceptions of the world are at diametric odds with one another, sit down to expound upon their vision of the world.  Picture Karl Marx and Adam Smith knocking back a couple beers at the local pub and you get the picture.  Now, imagine that one of our participants casts herself as pious and sedulous and the other, he is direct, blunt, incredulous, skeptical, and, no doubt, an atheist.  And, he has no qualms about casting aspersions on the motives of a woman otherwise regarded as a saint by most of the (religious) world.  Thus, you have the conflict central to Christopher Hitchens's book The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice.  Hitchens, by turns brutal, incisive, critical, observant, and, above all, unrelenting in his attacks of Catholicism and its most famous adherent after the Pope has slaughtered all sacred cows; Hitchens most certainly is not, to put it pithily, a Hindu. <br /> <br />So what do we have here?  In part an ad hominem attack against Mother Teresa, in part an intellectual exercise in repudiating religion's corrupting influence over the course of man's history, and in part an expose of the ignorant and credulous idolators who lionize Mother Teresa, the book operates as an indictment of her and the religion and god to which she devoted her life.  Indeed, Hitchen's rhetorical style is that of a legal pugilist: he marshals his facts together and uses them, unrelentingly, to take apart the case for the other side.  He effectively demolishes any claim that Mother Teresa's organization takes care of the world's poor.  He illustrates convincingly that, in consideration of several odd affiliations Mother Teresa engineered for herself and her charities, she is at best nave and at worst calculating and mendacious.  To wit, she: (1) took in millions from wealthy crooks like Charles Keating (he of the S&L crisis in the 1980s), (2) affiliated herself with despots (the Duvaliers of Haiti), and (3) acknowledged the authority of the Communists in her native Albania (those famous practitioners of religious freedom).  It seems fair to say that her claims of ignorance about the implications of these affiliations fall flat.  He casts her as a cold and calculating woman whose purpose is to solicit as many donations as possible for her charities, affiliate herself with western politicians (witness Mother Teresa and Hillary Clinton at an adoption center in Washington, DC), and insist that the poor for whom she cares focus on the suffering that is their fate ordained by God.   <br /> <br />All of these descriptions and affiliations would likely be harmless were it not for the connection Hitchens makes between Mother Teresa's work on behalf of her charities (the donations and affiliations she seeks) and the conditions of the various shelters and clinics she runs around the world for the destitute and hopeless.  Despite raking in millions from crooks and from perfectly honest people alike, she refuses to give the sick and dying medical treatment; instead, they are to smile more, to wear their suffering gladly, so to speak.  Medical attention, one assumes, would be prideful.  Instead of using her money to educate poor Indians in overpopulated slums about birth control, she is a fierce opponent of abortion, contraception, and any strain of thought that deviates from the dictates of the Catholic Church on human sexuality.  This is a problem because it is the poor who are less able to afford large families, and it is the dense population of the world's slums that leads to many of the otherwise manageable health risks, which the rich world no longer endures.  Despite a lifelong ignorance of human passion due to her celibacy, she deigns, as do all devout Catholics, to tell others how to handle their sexual lives. <br /> <br />All of these criticisms leveled at Mother Teresa are also criticisms of Catholocism, for Mother Teresa was its most outspoken exponent,outside of the Vatican.  Therefore, per Hitchens, the conniving and calculating way that Mother Teresa worked for her charities, and the lack of palliative care that these charities provided for their clients, is morally repugnant.  Mother Teresa used the ecclesiastical tools of authority and ontological mania to refuse medical treatment for those whose suffering she alleged to be God's will.  Hitchens thus argues that Mother Teresa usurped the authority of her God to pursue her own ends, in which the suffering of those she tried to help was but a mere tool to use in extracting money from the wealthy people of the world who, by dint of guilt, wanted merely to ameliorate the condition of the world's wretched. <br />
B000056HE9|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  It has a wonderful cast, every one of them is so well suited for their role.  It's even entertaining to watch them eat celery!  The Angel choir throughout gives such a hopeful feel and reminds us who we're dealing with.  I love the special effects as well.  Without computers I am sure the film makers had to be very clever to make them work and they were done beautifully.  I watch this every Christmas by the light of my Christmas tree.  Buy it and share it with your family and friends!
B0002DB52M|5.0|I hated this movie.  I almost walked out of the theater early.  I wanted to stick a fork in my eye after the movie was done so that I could make sure I was still alive.  The move reeks of pretentious European intellectualism.  The movie is a ridiculous conceit of minmialism meshed with Brechtian theory about theater.  The director is Anti-American, only slightly less rabidly so than the freakshows in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. <br /> <br />However, the movie is quite original in its execution.  Whatever one thinks of the minimalist style, and whatever one thinks of Brecht's work, it is an interesting approach to use in film, and one which I have never seen before.  Since so few films these days are able to create new methods of telling a story, the film deserves the accolades it has received. <br /> <br />It does, however, reek of aesthete pretentiousness and is best avoided by those who are either not interested in pretentious art-house cinema or who can't appreciate the movie solely based on its fresh approach to telling a story. <br /> <br />Those who will appreciate the movie the most are the intellectual sophisticates and post-modernists who idolize Derrida et al.
B0002IU988|1.0|I was so hyped up for this, and man what a letdown.  Tremonti is excellent, but the songs themselves are very shallow, and have no good hooks.  They lyrics are 3rd rate, and the songwriting is just very stale.  I'm selling my copy.
B00000DLVA|5.0|Nina has me feeling as if we were all growing up with her. In the beginning with \\"Life\\" we heard her in a youthful teenage phase of infatuation and carefree lifestyle. In \\"Gran Tourismo\\" Nina and her band make us feel the angst of the late 20s and early 30s. Her dissolusion with socitey and it's norms come clear. Now with \\"Long Gone Before Daylight\\" we feel as if she's now post-cynical in middle age, come to accept the stuff she can't change, with regrets and old memories. We can hear her baggage and lost loves in her voice. If you're like me you'll never forget her voice.
B000063S6Z|5.0|This album is such a beautiful album. Its very mellow and just kind of swoops in and takes you to place where everything is just groovy. Excellent chill out album. This album is a lot different then his play album, but I for one am glad its not the same. I think its real boring when a artist sticks to the same sound on every album. What fun is that. This album is definitly worth investing in.
B000286RKW|5.0|GoodFellas is a criminal epic that spans three decades while following the dramatic rise and fall of three gangsters through the eyes of one them-Henry Hill (Liotta). Early on, Jimmy Conway (De Niro) tells Henry the two most important rules for a gangster to follow: \\"Never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut.\\" Of course, Henry will break both these rules by the end of the movie. The film depicts their obsessive pursuit of the American Dream, how consuming it is, and how everything eventually turns sours and ultimately devours them. The movie is also about addiction and how it not only draws the characters in but us as well. We become addicted to the power of the film's style and visuals, which shows the seductive allure of the gangster lifestyle: to be able to do anything. And yet, the film isn't afraid to show the flipside-the nightmarish lows that come with the dizzying highs.<br /><br />The first DVD features two audio commentaries with the first being a cast and crew track. Comments from Martin Scorsese, actors Ray Liotta, Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino and Frank Vincent, co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, producers Irwin Winkler and Barbara De Fina, cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and editor Thelma Schoonmaker are edited together for select scenes thereby eliminating any dead air. Scorsese expertly analyzes several scenes (he could have easily done his own track) as he and Pileggi dominate the commentary.<br /><br />The second track, entitled \\"The Cop and Crook Commentary,\\" features the real Henry Hill and former FBI agent Edward McDonald who sponsored Henry for the witness protection program. This is a factual based track that makes one appreciate the authenticity of Scorsese's film.<br /><br />The second DVD starts things off with \\"Getting Made,\\" an excellent 30-minute retrospective featurette that mixes brand new interviews with Liotta, Sorvino and Bracco with older ones from Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci. The featurette acts as a nice companion piece to the commentaries.<br /><br />\\"The Workaday Gangster\\" features the real Henry Hill and examines how authentic the film depicted his life and the lure of the gangster lifestyle. This comes off as redundant after listening to Hill's commentary.<br /><br />One of the more entertaining featurettes is \\"The GoodFellas Legacy\\" which has several famous filmmakers gush about why they love the movie so much and what, in their opinion, makes it a great film.<br /><br />\\"Paper is Cheaper Than Film\\" is a brief look at the annotations Scorsese made to the screenplay that he and Pileggi wrote together.<br /><br />Rounding things out is a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />GoodFellas proved to be a favourite with critics and audiences alike. It became one of Scorsese's most successful and famous films since Taxi Driver. GoodFellas has stood the test of time and its legacy paved the way for The Sopranos with half of its cast alumni from Scorsese's movie. Warner Brothers has finally done this classic movie justice with an excellent two-DVD set.panion piece to the commentaries. <br /> <br />\\"The Workaday Gangster\\" features the real Henry Hill and examines how authentic the film depicted his life and the lure of the gangster lifestyle.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Opinions and understandings of the movie and its message have been somewhat mixed and very controversial. Instead of trying to argue what faith is right, who understands the gospel the best, and how accurate the movie is let's get to the bottom line. The movie has been an over all good thing for a country like ours that is increasingly tolerant of everything but discipline and Christian morality. The movie has inspired people to renew their commitment to God, read and re-read the gospel. It has burned disturbing images into our brains to remind us of his love, what was endured, and what was given for our salvation. Read and interpret the bible according to your understanding of our Lord. God bless Mel Gibson for helping so many move towards a first look, new look, or just another look at the good book and the message of love from Christ our Lord.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|Easily the best Eastwood western ever made. Eli does a great job acting as Tuco and Van Cleef is terrifying as angel eyes. But the thing that makes this movie so good is Leone's directing. His long pan shots and close-ups are so compeling that you can't help love the cinemotography. Easily the best in the trilogy and the best western until Eastwood's masterpiece Unforgiven.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|People criticize this CD all the time because people say it is more pop-punk than their earlier work.  HELLO!?!?!?  Ixnay is poppier than this!!!  The offspring is more of a skate-punk group rather than pop-punk.  Skate punk has more of a straight feel and Pop-punk has a more bouncy rhythm. There is a little pop punk on this CD (She's Got Issues, Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)), some songs with a little pop-punkinfluence, but mostly skate (No Brakes, Staring at the Sun, Americana), a song with a heavy metal-ish intro (Americana), a folk-ish song (Why don't You Get a Job?), an egyptian style rock song (Pay the Man), but mostly skate punk (Have You Ever, The Kids Aren't Alright, Feelings, Walla Wall, End of the Line).  In Short, 5 Skate songs, 3 songs that re skate with a lttle pop infused into their sructure, a song with a heavy metal intro, a folk-ish song, and egyptian song, and 2 pop-punk songs.Those factors added together make one CD that is mostly skate punk with a little pop-punk and diverse other styles.  What's wrong with diversity???  Blink-182 became instantly more popular with their diverse styles following the success of EotS.It just shows how the success of one song can change a band's reputation.  CD highlights include Have You Ever, Pretty Fly (For a White Guy), The Kids Aren't Alright, She's Got Issues and Americana.  The lowlight of the CD is Why Don't You Get a Job, a song that the Offspring thought they would do to have a song that everyone would like.  It's not really a band song, it was just roduced a little sloppily,  Just buy the CD, There is a song n the CD for all musical tastes except classical music.
B00006CXXU|2.0|The singles from this album are pleasant enough:- 'Dirrty', 'Beautiful', 'Fighter' and 'The Voice Within' but it goes down hill from there. The album is too long; if you can write an album of 20 songs that are completely INCREDIBLE then great, but there are at least 10 fillers here. Don't get me wrong; Christina has a good voice, but she tries to hard to be Mariah, Whitney and Celine, and her vocal range just does not extend that high without her resorting to shrieking/shouting most violently. In her quest to be seen as a true vocalist, she does the opposite, making herself to be an obvious wannabe. Her voice is good, and would be better if only she would stay within her range. The out of control voice ruins this album, and with the mediocre songs leaves quite a bad after taste. I'm afraid I would rather listen to a Britney album; Christina has a stronger voice and a better range, but Britney stays true to what she can do well, while Christina is too busy filling her songs with unsuccessful warbling. I am not trying to offend any fans here, so please don't penalise me; I'm just reporting my findings after listening to this album several times.
6304938241|5.0|Screenwriter Hossein Amini has abandoned the dense prose and convoluted syntax of Henry James's most complex and difficult novel and created instead a fresh, emotionally nuanced, and psychologically astute script, nominated for an Academy Award.  With a remarkable cast, breathtaking cinematography (Eduardo Serra), and a soft background score filled with strings, harp, and piano (Edward Shearmur), Director Iain Softley has created a magnificent film that succeeds in being emotionally affecting, intellectually stimulating, and aesthetically rewarding, a film in which every element contributes to a satisfying whole.<br /><br />Remaining true to the story of James's novel, the film introduces Kate Croy (Helena Bonham Carter) as the beautiful but impoverished niece of a wealthy socialite (Charlotte Rampling), bent upon finding her a husband of means, but Kate must sever ties with her opium-addicted father and end her relationship with Merton Densher (Linus Roache), a penniless journalist.  A friend of Kate, heiress Millie Theale (Alison Elliot), invites her to Venice, where Millie insists on living life to the fullest even as she is dying of an unnamed disease.  There Kate introduces Millie to Densher, to whom she is immediately attracted.  Kate desperately suggests to Densher that he pursue Millie, who may, upon her death, leave Densher wealthy enough to marry Kate.<br /><br />Without such a brilliant cast, such a story would resemble the worst of melodramas, but Bonham Carter (nominated for an Oscar as Best Actress) creates in Kate a character so tormented by her love that one understands her deviousness to be the result of desperation.  Alison Elliot creates a Millie whose strength and desire to live life are so strong that her passion for Densher is plausible, and her willingness to go to his room at night becomes a courageous statement, rather than a maudlin gesture.  Linus Roache as Densher is phlegmatic enough that he can be manipulated by Kate, but he shows backbone in his desire to honor Millie and avoids the pitfall of being considered weak.<br /><br />The acting is subtle, understated, and profoundly affecting, with many revealing close-ups, and emotions conveyed through gestures, body language, and occasionally, mere eye contact.  The Academy Award-nominated cinematography, especially in Venice, features individual elements in one scene blending into the succeeding scene, bridges framing action on the canals, and a dramatic use of darkness and light.  The Oscar-nominated costuming (Sandy Powell) adds to the mood and atmosphere, with the music providing an effective bridge between scenes.  Every aspect of the film works, and not a word or gesture is wasted in this quietly presented drama of great power.  Mary Whipplee to honor Millie and avoids the pitfall of being considered weak.

B00005JMUA|3.0|Even though vol. 2 is the continued second half of vol. 1, the two movies don't match up in terms of style. Where vol. 1 is action-packed and over-the-top gory, vol. 2 is restrained, polite, and even a little touching. I was disappointed with the lack of action that vol. 1 so clearly delivered as well as with the revelation of the Bride's name; it added nothing to the story or her character, and I wanted to laugh at their choice of moniker. <br /> <br />Darryl Hannah and Uma Thurman and the Pai Wei-man, however, give amazing performances. <br /> <br />I say don't expect the blood, guts, and violence of the first film, and you might appreciate it more than I did. <br />
6304493681|1.0|What the????? I didn't get this at all. I hate anime movies adapted from comic books.........they always focus more on cramming as much as they can in instead of telling a story.
0688156819|5.0|Is there more to say? It is Tim Burton. It is weird. It requires a sense of humor. And intelligence. If you have neither, or wonder if you do, then pass on this book. If you nodded, then what the heck are you reading reviews for? Buy it.
B000059HAI|5.0|I just watched Tora! Tora! Tora! for about the fourth time, after being away from it for about 10 years. This is done in documentary style, and according to the commentary basically all incidents are true.  <br /> <br />I had a chance to see part of the filming in 1969, on North Cane Street in the town of Wahiawa. We watched with fascination as one scene was shot over and over again. This was a street allegedly in downtown Honolulu. The young man delivering the telegram to Fort Shafter is pulling out of the alley on his motorcycle. Then the camera catches the Japanese zeros flying overhead, signifying that it is too late for telegrams. The person who actually delivered the telegram in his youth was a Mr. Fujimoto, who was on the set as a consultant. Unfortunately, almost the entire sequence was left out of the final cut. <br /> <br />Despite this, both the film and the DVD extras get five stars. The short called \\"Day of Infamy\\" adds to the film and clarifies specific historical points. And the running directors commentary explains the obstacles that had to be overcome in this joint U.S.-Japanese effort, including the different cultural perspectives in how to put everything together. Plus that, it explains many technical details that went into making the film.A valuable resource for amateur and professional filmmakers alike.  <br /> <br />The feature and the DVD extras can be enjoyed at different levels and be revisited over and over. I myself spent over 5 hours in one day going through the whole thing. The film is an excellent supplement to documentaries that use real footage. Definitely an educational experience.
B0002O7XVI|5.0|I went to see this movie at the Odeon Southampton , England , the week it came out . It changed my life and not only re introduced me to Thomas Hardy but also set a benchmark for production values that no movie has ever come close to . <br />There is true elegance in every frame and the movie has a soundtrack to die for . <br />You need to own this DVD . You really do . <br /> <br />Neville Judd  <br />
1577311523|5.0|The Power of Now is a wonderful book that has made for many interesting discussions, particularly regarding how to bring us all into this now moment, where all change, awareness, and choices are made consciously, rather than unconsciously with our egoic minds.  <br />The concepts are clearly given to uproot our unconscious patterns so that we can all live with more inner peace and awareness, rather than projecting into past or future. This is a book where practicing the concepts will make for a life that carries much more inner peace.  <br /> <br />If you have a discussion group, this is one book you will definitely get a lot out of. Highly recommended. <br />
B0002I831S|5.0|For those who have not previously purchased the VHS tapes, the video CD version or the 2 episode per DVD set, this is the best bargain (in comparison) of all of them. Yes, it was irritating to purchase the VHS tapes and then find out the set was burned to DVD, and now it's irritating to find that 15 or so boxes of the 2 per DVD set will be burned to 1 box with 8 DVDs. In 50 years, I'll be irritated that they've been etched onto a 1\\" square chip in DV holographic format with 24 channel sound. But I'll still buy it. And you will too.
B0000026NC|2.0|Having read some of the reviews for this album I went ahead with my purchase. A big mistake. The audio engineers must have been lacking in experience because as much as I like Pink Floyd this is really bad in the sound department. I recently puchased Pulse. A far superior work worthy of five stars. This one you can forget about. Very disappointing.
B0000249ZZ|5.0|Clapton's Les Paul/Marshall combo was revolutionary when this album was released. Some people may prefer the thinner sounding Strat on his solo recordings, but this is the ultimate tone for me, including the SG he played in Cream. Not only is the stereo version on this remastered CD, but original mono mix also appears with some very noticeable differences.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|The Human Stain\\" is an interesting film about the bond between an unlikely couple (played by Nicole Kidman and Anthony Hopkins).  The one thing they seem to have in common is a life of emotional heartbreak, loneliness, and pain.  The film basically tells the story of their lives and eventual coming together through a series of flashbacks.  I did not find these flashbacks at all confusing as some reviewers have.  However, the film is somewhat flawed and lacking.  It has a tendency to drag slightly and never really takes off.  The ending is somewhat disappointing and could have been written much more effectively.  However, the acting performances are outstanding.  I think this is Nicole Kidman's best acting role.  Her performance as an emotionally weakened, unsophisticated woman is outstanding.  Also brilliant are Anthony Hopkins and Gary Sinise (a friend of Hopkins' character who narrates the movie).  And Ed Harris does a good job playing Kidman's psychotic ex-husband.  Despite its weaknesses, this is an interesting film backed by some excellent acting.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Eric Clapton has been introducing the \\"Blues\\" to new audiences for almost his entire life.  Early in his career, he could take an obsure blues song like \\"Crossroads\\" and make it into a rock hit. A number of Robert Johnson's songs were recorded in the corner of a hotel room on ancient equipment. These harsh sounding, yet powerful performances can send chills up your spine. Sadly, \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\" is just plain boring to listen to. The song arrangements stay mostly faithful to the original recordings, but there are too many instruments on them. The band contains some fine musicians, but they sound so polished and lifeless.  Clapton's playing is competent as usual, but it lacks the enthusiam that used to set him apart from all his peers.
B00005JLD4|4.0|This movie, based on a true story, tells the story of three half-caste aboriginal girls.  After being forcibly removed from their families by the Australian government, for integration into white society, they run away and try to return home, along 1200 miles of a rabbit-proof fence.   <br /> <br />Their journey is heart-rending and amazing.  And the epilogue, narrating what happened later in their lives, is even more stunning. <br /> <br />A story that is simulataneously sad and awe-inspiring, it effectively brings this period of Australian history to life and demonstrate's the policy's effect on one family. <br />
B00005JMAH|5.0|It's only fitting.  Prisoner of Azkaban was such a great book, so much better than the first two, so it's appropriate that we get such a great movie out of it.  The first two movies were admirable in their devotion to the story, but they sometimes they tried so hard to include every line from the books that they sucked the magic out of the story. <br /> <br />Cuaron's touch is brilliant.  There are so many brief moments that make the movie so great, like Harry's ride on Buckbeak, one calming moment of pure joy.  Or the shot of the Hogwarts Express from afar with the dementor approaching and Ron's terrified hand on the window.  Or Lupin's (a great job by David Thewlis) many scenes with Harry, particularly the one outside in which Lupin talks about Lily.  Or the several references to time via the clocks.  And with the third book so serious, I appreciated Cuaron's dismissing of cuddliness.  <br /> <br />The acting is notable on two fronts.  One is Daniel Radcliffe, whose Harry is much more subtle and deep than ever before.  But the real treat is Gary Oldman as Sirius, whose portrayal is absolutely perfect.  I love Sirius, as so many others do, and was thrilled to see him get such a portrayal.  As the expected murderer, he's chillingly menacing.  As someone seeking revenge on Pettigrew, he's morally vengeful.  As a friend to Harry about to fly to freedom, he's touchingly caring. <br /> <br />That leads me to my only complaint with the movie, its treatment of the scene in the Shrieking Shack.  It's such a tremendous scene, and so much is revealed, that I believe it should have been given longer treatment.  That way, we would have gotten to see the relationship between Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew to James and seen a more gradual accepting of Sirius's story from Harry.   <br /> <br />But that is ok.  Every other change made, including to dismiss the Quidditch cup, gloss over Ron and Hermione's fight, and give Dumbledore's wisdom lines to Sirius and Lupin, worked great inthe movie. <br /> <br />Even the scenery reflects the proper mood of the story, with most of the scenes set outside in a background of muted grays, browns, and greens.  If the story feels rushed, that's because a great amount of time is spent, as it should be, on the one fateful night that includes Buckbeak's encounter, the Shrieking Shack scene, and the beautiful Patronus.   <br /> <br />Cuaron has produced a masterpiece.  It's a shame he has decided to take a break for movie 4.  I can only hope he comes back for book 5.  It would only be fitting for the two best books to have the two best movies.

6305127646|5.0|This is a highly entertaining prequel to the character of the Saint. It explains why the Saint is the Saint. I was very pleased wwith this film and the Saint is one of my favorite characters of all time. There are a few changes here, but most of them work very well within the prequel context. This is the first movie to eplain how a young Simon Templar began his exploits as a master criminal and became a force for justice. I loved the master of disguise angle of the movie. It's far more extreme in the movie than it ever was in the Saint books, but I'm okay with that. I've never recovered from the literary Saint dressing as a nun! LOL! Good old Simon! The Saint has been a source of entertainment for me for years and this film is no exception. It has a great cast and a adventurous vibe that captures the spirit of my favorite Saint adventures. I am more than a little surprised by the complaints on here about the romantic elements of the movie. The Saint stories were always larger than life. Good does not always triumph over evil in the real world, but that never stopped the Saint. What's wrong with a bigger than life romantic adventure? Why must Simon Templar be an asexual being? He has a heart and should have feelings of love like the rest of us. Those who have a problem with romance may not enjoy this movie, but those who like romantic adventures should give this a try. I like a good adventure/love story and this movie is a delightful one. I also don't understand how reviewers can call this movie \\"trash\\" and then give it 3 stars! LOL! Too many people are too pretentious to admit they enjoyed this. I'm not. Do you love the character of Saint? Do you enjoy romantic adventure movies? Like espionage movies? Give this a try!
B0001ZX0OC|3.0|I'd actually give this film 3.5 stars. In short, it was an absorbing movie that held my interest throughout. That said, I don't think it was quite perfect. <br /> <br />Basically, I thought there was a bit of tension between the film's \\"prestige/artsy\\" aspirations and its more conventional whodunnit structure. I think it was stronger on the latter, and couldn't quite justify its artistic ambitions, though again, I did enjoy the movie. <br /> <br />First, I thought the mood setting elements were excellent. Eastwood convnicingly brings us to a working-class neighborhood loosely resembling the Charlestown section of Boston (which is pretty much completely yuppiefied these days, but I digress). The camera work was utterly suberb, and the dark, brooding musical score set the right tone. <br /> <br />The accents weren't perfect (I say this as a Bostonian) but Hollywood NEVER gets the Boston accent right, so, I don't hold that against the film. <br /> <br />And the acting really was top-notch. Sean Penn was amazingly poweful. Fishburne and Bacon were effective as the cop duo. Robbins thoroughly deserved his Oscar for his deeply moving performance, and Marcia Gay Harden as his wife was also riveting. <br /> <br />I thought \\"Mystic River\\" did have a few plotting difficulties, and that keeps me from giving it 4 or 5 stars. SPOILERS BELOW. <br /> <br />First, I must say I tend to agree with the comments about Laura Linney's Lady MacBeth speech at the end. Perhaps in  the book we're given some clues or justification as to why we should expect such words from her character; but in the film her speech comes  from completely out of the blue, and therefore seems forced, contrived, and inexplicable (so this is one of the moments where the film seems to strive for \\"artsyness\\"). <br /> <br />Secondly, and most egregiously (this is the one place where the film really dissapointed me) is when we learn of Dave's revelation as to what really happened the night of the murder. This just seemed inserted out of nowhere. Yes, we realize he has his reasons for being especially sensitive to the issue of the sexual abuse of children, but it's really not plausibe that the very night where he goes beserk and kills a molester just happens to be the same night his childhood friend's daughter is likewise killed. Again, that may be more the author's fault than the movie-maker's, but I thought it could have been handled with more deftness, so it doesn't have that heavy-handed deus ex machina feel. <br /> <br />Still, the movie was a solid and entertaining effort from Clint Eastwood -- just don't expect Citizen Kane and you won't be dissapointed.
B00000JPYQ|4.0|the 70's.  Any of you who have not heard /listened to UFO, do yourself a favor and try them out.  UFO from Lights Out to Doctor-Doctor to Cherry are in for a treat.  I am so glad that I bought this CD two months back.  It has not left my cd player.  Rock On!
B000002H97|4.0|Looking back on the long and storied career of Metallica, I would see this a turning point for the band.  All of their releases prior to this were staples of any metal fan's collection and rightfully so.  This album managed, at least for me, to keep that spirit alive.  This is Metallica's last great album.  Load, Reload, etc. just do not sound like the old Metallica that I know.  I got a little excited last summer when I heard that St. Anger was to be a return to the glory days of the band.  However, I was fortunate enough to listen to it first, and it obviously does not compare to albums like this one.  If you are just getting into Metallica, take my advice and get their first album and all subsequent albums up to and including this one, and STOP!  You'll be glad you did.
B00005JLR8|1.0|This movie was like Pinocchio on a couple dozen strings.  Everything was stilted, staged and cliche, but I guess that is what America calls \\"magical\\" these days.  (Must be why they all for any marketing and propaganda thrown at them.)  For those who pointed out the glorified bad parenting in earlier posts, I agree whole heartedly.  In addition to the negligence there were other storyline questions:  Why does the daughter have a very small and modern video camera with amazing zooming abilities and a flip screen in a movie that takes place in the eighties?  How can one sell a beat up station wagon and afford ANY apartment in New York City, let alone a top story with tons of space?  Does a ten year old really say something like, \\"I've been carrying this family on my back for the past year.\\"?  Do people really launch into dialogues and monologues reinacting horrific events from their past? <br /> <br />Most of you Kool-Aid drinkers out there are gonna knock me over the head with your bad rating of this review, but oh well.  <br />For the few left whose opinions I value . . . Is it just me, or are we sinking even deeper?
630575067X|5.0|I feel badly for people who liked the older ones and can't warm up to the new movies. The world would be a much darker place without George Lucas and his vision. <br /> <br />Just think of Jar Jar as Princess Lea with a horse face and thrill to the fabulous cinematography and effects.  The next one <br />is even better!  Imagine this one with almost no Jar Jar and no goofy little kid.
B000244EMO|4.0|More than two years after its international release, DVD collectors in the good old U.S. finally get their chance to own the special edition of \\"Predator\\". For some, John McTiernan's directorial debut about a team of commandos being hunted by an invisible alien hunter in Central America was just a cheesy B-movie that earned crediblity simply based on it being a Schwarzennegger vehicle. If you're like me though and you grew up on this one, you probably weren't happy with the previous practically bare bones DVD edition. Is this new DVD worth the wait though?<br /><br />This special edition not only has upgraded picture with an amazing anamorphic widescreen presentation (1.85:1 ratio, for those who want to know). I was honestly quite impressed at how good this movie looks. McTiernan's audio commentary is pretty good as well. The director gives some interesting factoids about his first feature though he is a bit dry at some times. There is also a text track that includes information about the film. The second disc however is where all the best goodies are located. There is a cool new documentary called \\"If It Bleeds We Can Kill It\\" where the cast and crew share all their stories from behind the scenes. This includes both archive footage of Arnold, Jessie Ventura, and many others as well as new interviews with Carl Weathers, Shane Black, and McTiernan. There are also seven indiviual featurettes on the special effects and other things. The most unique of these is one dedicated to Kevin Peter Hall, the late actor who played the Predator and also showed up briefly in the end of the film as a chopper pilot. There is also a deleted sequence from the movie where Dutch is being chased by the Predator. The problem is the scene was never completed and the actual F-X shots of the creature are blue screen captures.<br /><br />I do have a few minor complains with this special edition. None of the original trailers or TV spots were included and the only \\"trailer\\" on here is an ad for Fox's \\"Alien Quadrilogy\\" set. I would also have liked to have seen more info on Jean-Claude Van Damme's work in the film. There is one photo of him with Carl Weathers in the \\"Still Gallery\\" but no mention is made of him anywhere else. For those who are wondering, Van Damme played the Predator during the more athletic scenes that would have been too difficult for the massive Kevin Peter Hall to perform. Despite those small complaints, this is an amazing DVD and well worth the wait.<br /><br />I encourage anyone who has never seen \\"Predator\\" to go pick this one up. With the recent release of the watered-down \\"Alien Vs. Predator\\" movie, you might as well see one of the films that inspired it. If you can sit through a mediocre franchise killer like that, you should at least go back and see the original. As for those who grew up loving \\"Predator\\", it's a no-brainer.d for Fox's \\"Alien Quadrilogy\\" set. I would also have liked to have seen more info on Jean-Claude Van Damme's work in the film.

B00005JMUA|5.0|Unlike the merely violent and often forced Vol 1., Vol 2. so effectively entwines a well-wrought story with thrilling action (including an absolutely terrifying scene of Uma buried alive) that it stands on its own as a great film. Where Tarantino's dialogue in Vol. 1 reached too hard for the director's trademark, gripping exchanges, every scene in Vol. 2 sizzles with all the talent and confidence expected from one of America's premier directors. Gone is the egotism and self-consciousness that overshadowed a potentially intriguing epic the first time around. Here Tarantino elicits stunning performances from all involved: Madsen, Hannah, Carradine and, of course, Uma. Especially worthy of Tarantino's reputation is Carradine's monologue towards the end about the connection between Superman and the average Joe. I think it is interesting to watch two distinct camps emerge from Tarantino's fan base: those who loved the animation and empty gore of Vol. 1 tend to dislike the more chatty and less graphic second installment. While I personally favor the latter, I understand the allures Vol 1. offers to some fans. To me, however, only the second volume holds a candle to \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" or \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"
157270036X|3.0|I have read the book before and love it! I don't really like the CD version though. The reader's fake southern accent makes it very hard to understand. I don't know why they didn't use a southerner to do the reading. When the reader pronounced \\"pecan\\"<br /><br />\\"pee can\\" rather that the \\"pa cahn\\" it made everything else less believable . I had to relisten to the first CD three times to get it. It's a \\"duh\\" thing but when a book is written about the south use \\"real\\" southerners for the audio book.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|first, i would like to say that, im an open minded person thats  why i decided to even try giving slipknot a chance with vol:3, because just maiby they  could sound decent unlike their other albums...All i have to say is that, they still sound like crap and, still can't do one decent song in their whole pathetic career. First, nine people in a damn band ?! With deforming masks, which looks realy retarded and not to mention the production is pretty horrible.Now, slipknot is trying to sound like staind,avril,and ,good charlotte, which is funny to me because, they never realy appeal  as a heavy band in my eyes  but simply a carbon copy of korn & coal chamber mix together. Slayer is on tour with slipknot and, i bet that knot thinks their real metalheads now... Well, sorry to inform  you but who ever goes to slayer shows nowdays are strictly 13 year olds  who loves mtv but if you do see old people that... Then, its just sad. Anyways, slayer used to be good but now they just plain suck, but reign in blood is  still the best album out of slayer !Back to weak slipknot, right ?For people who likes backstreetboys gone  nu-metal and loves trl then vol3 is for you but if actullie love metal then don't even bother with this at all...Trust me! Not recommended

B00028HBKM|1.0|This controversial movie about the final hours of Christ's suffering leading up to his death has received rave reviews from many leaders in the general Christian community, who laud it as a very realistic portrayal of Christ's life, and a thoroughly moving experience.  Being moved by the images, drama, music, and graphic violence of an R rated movie is different than being moved by the gospel.  I want to go on record as a Christian leader who does not share the enthusiasm.  The film's producer, Mel Gibson, is a devout Roman Catholic, and as a devout Protestant I cannot share his passion for this project, for several reasons:<br /><br />1. A ROMAN CATHOLIC MESSAGE<br /><br />a) A distorted message.<br /><br />Despite its claims about authenticity and accuracy, \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" does not replicate the gospel accounts, but presents a distorted view of the gospels influenced by Gibson's Roman Catholic background.  Gibson has supplemented the Biblical gospel accounts with source material from the diaries of a Catholic mystic (Anne Catherine Emmerich's \\"The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ\\")  This is plainly evident in the prominent portrayal of Mary, and the link between the cross and the altar of the mass - important themes peculiar to Roman Catholic theology.  The gospel according to Mel is not the same as the gospel according to Matthew.<br /><br />b) An incomplete message.<br /><br />Secular viewers cannot be expected to understand what they're seeing without a fuller proclamation of the doctrine of sin and salvation.  Little wonder that many non-Christian viewers left the theatre confused.  Is this any surprise?  The Ethiopian eunuch described in Acts 8 had the same reaction when he read about Christ's suffering in Isaiah 53.  When asked \\"Do you understand what you are reading?\\" he answered \\"How can I, unless someone explains it to me?\\"  A cinematic version of Christ's suffering is in itself incomplete without the preaching of the gospel and a call to faith.  It shows *how* Jesus died, but not *why* He died.  Without someone explaining it, is it any wonder that unbelieving viewers do not understand what they are seeing?  Instead of leaving the cinema as new converts, many non-Christians left disgusted at the graphic violence (which many attest is worse than they've seen in any secular movies), convinced the movie was more bloody than spiritual, and questioning the credibility of Christians who normally abhor Hollywood's violence.<br /><br />2. A ROMAN CATHOLIC MEDIUM<br /><br />Aside from the fact that the movie's doctrinal content is questionable, the whole notion of turning the Bible into film form is seriously suspect. It is not only the message that is influenced by Roman Catholic theology, but also the medium.<br /><br />a) Presenting the gospel in film *can* not be done.<br /><br />A movie about Christ's life inevitably includes significant speculation and fiction, and even the best attempts to be \\"authentic\\" will ultimately be a distortion of the Bible. What makes Christ's suffering unique is that it was accompanied by a sense of God's wrath and curse which sinners deserve.  A film might attempt to portray the horror of physical suffering and torture, but it cannot do justice to the spiritual aspect of being cursed by God, which the Bible highlights as the most significant aspect of Christ's suffering.  Translating the gospels into film and doing full justice to God's revelation in the Bible is impossible.<br /><br />b) Presenting the gospel in film *may* not be done.<br /><br />Sola Scriptura (by Scripture alone) is a basic Biblical principle defended by Protestant Churches with their roots in the Reformation.  It is echoed in many of their confessional documents, such as Lord's Day 35 of the Heidelberg Catechism in connection with the second commandment: God \\"wants His people to be taught not by means of dumb images but by the living preaching of His Word.\\" We should not be wiser than God. The meansthat the Holy Spirit uses to work and strengthen faith is the reading and preaching of God's Word, along with the sacraments. Translating the Bible narratives about Christ into the visual images of film ultimately suggests an insufficiency in the Word and Sacraments, and at bottom tries to cater to man's natural curiosity and dissatisfaction with the written Word! Christians should not be surprised to find themselves curious about how this film presents Christ's life, since sinful hearts are naturally not content with limiting themselves to God's revelation and His official means of grace.  Such fascination is precisely the reason for the appeal of all violations of the second commandment. We must however limit ourselves to the official means of grace that the most wise God has ordained to be the food of our soul: the audible preaching and the visible sacraments.<br /><br />Many Christians who are enthusiastic about this movie may be disappointed at my lack of enthusiasm for a project that purports to honour Christ.  But being Biblical is more than just about getting the message right, it's about getting the medium right too. Noble ambitions do not justify the use of methods that are not pleasing to God.  It's surprising that Protestants would uncritically accept a movie that in principle is the contemporary equivalent of a Roman Catholic stained glass window, a cinematic \\"image\\" used in addition to the Bible to teach people the gospel.  Is the Bible really so deficient that we need this?  This is an opportunity to renew a passion for the Word - read and preached - which reveals the living Christ. Ultimately only the Bible must shape my understanding of Christ's suffering, the gospel according to Matthew, not the gospel according to Mel.  If you are looking for greater insight into Christ's passion, and if you want your understanding of Jesus Christ to be based on the Bible alone, then my advice is: don't watch the movie, but read the Book! - GODLY GADFLYthat the Holy Spirit uses to work and strengthen faith is the reading and preaching of God's Word, along with the sacraments.

Ultimately only the Bible must shape my understanding of Christ's suffering, the gospel according to Matthew, not the gospel according to Mel.  If you are looking for greater insight into Christ's passion, and if you want your understanding of Jesus Christ to be based on the Bible alone, then my advice is: don't watch the movie, but read the Book! - GODLY GADFLY/>

B00005JMUA|4.0|You have to admire Tarantino for his unabashed willingness to take chances which, when they come off on screen, don't really seem like chances at all, just his natural cinematic prowess.   <br /> <br />There are the usual Tarantino trappings that infuse all his movies; murder, money, characters following his own impudent way of speaking (you can almost hear Tarantino reciting the club owner's words), and Uma Thurman, who looks like hell and fights like it too.  There are also the Tarantino surprises, the completely unexpected moments that really grab you whether they are brash (plucking out Elle's eyeball) or subtle (being buried alive). <br /> <br />However, the movie is not as energetic or frenetic as the first, certainly not as bloody or violent (although gruesome things happen).  Is it a short-coming?   <br /> <br />Yes: The first movie rampaged for two hours and dropped us all off in Anticipation-Land.  We visited hand-to-hand combat in someone's suburban house, a very bright-yellow truck, Japan's nightspots and ancient settings, and were treated to an introduction of Anime (where the movie really gets its inspiration).  Everything happens briskly, the action is almost, almost wall-to-wall, and the tone is basically, \\"Here I Come.\\" <br /> <br />No: Kill Bill 2 slows things down.  It's almost as if Black Mamba has become more thoughtful about her revenge, and takes more time to contemplate its significance.  One such scene is her and Bill (when they weren't so hostile) in the desert talking about Pai-Mei, the Shaolin master who would instruct Thurman's character.  It's a quiet scene, moody, almost a whisper lost in the commotion surrounding it; and nowhere would it fit in Kill Bill 1. <br /> <br />Perhaps this is why the movies were split up, because Tarantino reached a certain point in Volume 1 and said, \\"Now begins a different kind of movie, still named Kill Bill, but a shade quieter.\\"  Not to say that the movie is slow; but I did get bored in spots, whereas in Kill Bill 1 I was always at least partially riveted. <br /> <br />The ending is spectacularly done, even if it is longer than it needs to be.  All you need to know about the Black Mamba/Bill face-off is that neither one of them leaves their seat. <br /> <br />So now that these two movies are out, they will go down as one of Tarantino's best, and it is certainly his best since \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"  To fans of anime and kung-fu movies it's the movie they've been waiting for.  To fans of Tarantino, you might be thrilled, or slightly miffed.  To other movie-makers, you'll be jealous.  Finally, to film snobs like myself, it'll make a nice weekender viewing. <br />
B000002JOH|5.0|I purchased this album years ago, and I listen to it every week at least. I enjoy every song on this album, more or less.
B000089RVR|4.0|I gave this CD 4 starts instead of 5 because there are a few songs that are too slow and kinda boring, but the CD is good overall. <BR>The Songs...<br />1. White flag: one of the best on the album, really like it. 10/10<BR>2. Stoned: another very good song, the beat is excelent. 10/10<BR>3. Life for rent: this is a nice song, a cool meaning. 9/10<BR>4. Mary`s in india: kinda slow, but it gets better after a few listens, not much music in this song, my least favorite. 6.5/10<BR>5. see you when you`re 40: I still don`t know all the words to this song, but i know some of it and it`s a pretty good song. 8/10<BR>6. Don`t leave home: the 2nd single, and an excelent song! I can`t see why anyone whould not like this song, it`s one of the best on the CD. 10/10<BR>7. Who makes you feel: I really like this song, it`s different then the rest on the album, an easy sing along and just a cool song. 9.5/10<BR>8. Sand in my shoes: This one is a little faster then the rest and it sounds really good, cool music around the middle when she`s not singing. 9/10<BR>9.: Do you have a little time: I love the lyrics in this one, (why do you still run when you could walk with me life will pass you by when you move this quickly) great song! 9.5/10<BR>10. This land is mine: her voice shines here, an awesome song. 10/10<BR>11. See the sun: this song is beautiful, no one could sing it like Dido, another excelent song, Very relaxing. 10/10<br />there`s a hidden track after see the sun, about 2 minutes after and it`s a very nice song/ending, so there you have it, buy the CD, you won`t regret it.
0316666343|5.0|A lot of readers dont know that Alice Sebold was raped when she was in college. I think its amazing that she can write books about something so close to her. I know a lot of readers didnt like the idea of susie and ruth switching places but I'm sure Alice Sebold thought alot about what would of happened if she died that night. Its a very nice thought to come back for a day and be with your loved ones. And even though it may not be realistic it gives hope to some readers. I think Alice Sebold is a fantastic writer and people should take the book for what it is not compare it to something else. If you want a more realistic story read Lucky : A Memoir also by Alice Sebold which is a non fiction story..her story <br />

B000002UAU|5.0|During the summer of '67 I was literally waiting to be drafted into the Armed Forces. I couldn't get a job because of my draft status (1A)...no one wanted to hire someone who they'd lose soon. I purchased this album in May as I remember. I took it home and read the lyrics as I listened. There was no other album that included lyrics that I'd seen previously. I was mesmerized. I would listen over and over again. The visual images conjured up by the music and lyrics was profound (and I didn't even use drugs). In a time where nothing seemed certain, I had The Beatles to depend on. I still judge all music by this album and after never forty years, I still can listen to it and be swept away realizing the past wasn't really that bad because of it. <br />
B0001MDP3G|4.0|The movie is pretty faithful to the book (if you've read the book, you'll understand why I was hoping against hope they MIGHT \\"go Hollywood\\" at the end).  It's beautifully shot and the scenery is gorgeous.  The music adds a lot to the whole setting of the story (Allison Krauss is  not the only musician in this genre, but she's one of the best and perfect for the film), and what a fabulous cast!    This is the best acting I've ever seen from Jude Law-- he should try being guileless more often; when he adds his usual saracastic/cynical expression (I suppose in an attempt to seem witty) he often seems shrill as he did in \\"Wilde\\" and \\"Talented Mr. Ripley.\\"  Here he's very moving, and he even made me cry in one scene where he was missing his love, Ada.    Nicole Kidman is unsurprisingly radiant-- she's such a versatile actress whose talents are sometimes overlooked because of her beauty.  But Renee Zellweger is most impressive.  She is much more than an ingenue, she's a little chameleon.  If anyone has earned the right to Meryl Streep's crown it may be her-- despite her lack of formal training.   She brought tears to my eyes more than once, and my mother used up most of a box of tissues. Philip Seymour Hoffman is, as always, one of the great pleasures of life.       The movie is pretty long and in my opinion takes too long to get started.  There's a long section of bombings and warfare early on that do nothing really but establish what Inman is deserting.  I think a little of this goes a long way.  There can't be too many people who would go to see this film (or rent it) who haven't seen Gone with the Wind or the PBS \\"Civil War.\\"  I'm not saying omit it, but it could be shortened.    Also the book leaps somehow more quickly from episode to episode, and the mythic elements of Odysseus' return are much more clear.  Sometimes in the film if you don't know the book the episodes seem random instead of leading inevitably home.  The film does heighten the role of the antagonist, but I didn't mind that; it's probably necessary for film and even helped the \\"war is hell\\" theme (more than the battle scenes I think).    All in all, this is solid and powerful.  A beautiful weepy with enough explosions and action for the boys, too.
B000286S8S|5.0|Excellent CD's to add to your Van Halen collection if you're fans.  Should have been named Greatest Hits Volume II.  Would definitely recommend to all who grew up in the late 70's and 80's like I did.  Van Halen is definitey one of the best bands ever and I myself prefer the Hagar years to those of Lee Roth.

B000002LVB|3.0|I've been listening to the velvet underground for quite a while now, but for some reason had only ever heard the albums with John Cale. The debut album was a combination of gorgeously subdued numbers occasionally interspersed with sonic adventures that were both painful and exhilarating. Of course, `White light/White heat' is renowned for its extension of this forceful tactic with a title that humorously alluded to the significance of the white noise that the record contained.  <br /> <br />The velvets third album was a masterful effort and certainly their best in my opinion. John Cale's experimentation had leveled out to a perfect medium ground. The downbeat, smooth songs of the album stank of urban cool yet retained a level of modesty that the velvet were not, on any other release, capable of displaying. <br /> <br />So when I finally got a copy of `Loaded', I was, not surprisingly, very curious to hear just what followed this near perfect album. `Loaded' begins and ends with what are perhaps its strongest tracks. `Who loves the sun' is a vital medium paced rocker that swims in the same urban cool and smooth, simple rhythms of the previous record. But admittedly, and disappointing, the majority of the album chugs along without any outstanding moments, and at a monotonously similar pace.  <br /> <br />No doubt that `Sweet Jane' and `Rock and Roll' are vigorous rockers of classic status, and the closer `Oh! Sweet Nuthin' jams out to a typically loose and care free end, but in general the album doesn't feel as exciting as their previous efforts. All of the tracks on the record are enjoyable listens and can't be faulted as solid rock and roll tunes. However, the lack of variety is evident after a couple of complete listens. Medium paced rock and roll song after medium paced rock and roll song give way to the album closer `Oh! Sweet Nuthin', featuring some off key vocals, sitting in front of some reverb soaked (and kinda spooky) backing vocals, and interchanged with some lovely drum and guitar rock and roll jamming. An entertaining yet still unsurprising finish. <br /> <br />In any case, it seems throughout the record that John Cale is sorely missed, and consequently leaves Reed's competent yet relatively unexciting writing skills left to fall a little bit short. Even the rockers don't seem to carry the same frantic energy and enthusiasm that gave songs like 'Beginning to see the light' and 'I'm waiting for the man' their charm. The production is sloppy at times, though this is never a negative point as it seems to give the songs a little more life and spontaneity. <br /> <br />Oh, and `Lonesome Cowboy Bill' is just plain irritating. <br /> <br />Overall Loaded is a vaguely entertaining rock and roll album that's got a reasonable amount of charm, and a couple of classic tunes. As a stand-alone album I think it's a solid collection of rock and roll songs, although a little too fluffy at times. Considering what the velvets had achieved in their previous outings, 'Loaded' comes off, frankly, sounding a little dull. <br /> <br />5.5 outta 10 <br />
B00009MECF|5.0|I saw this today, and I was blown away by Leo's excellent acting and also Mark Whalbergs as well. This movie shows a great example about addiction and in this case it was heroin. If you have seen Trainspotting or Requiem For A Dream then you will like this film, I personally thought it was better then Trainspotting and the acting was better then Requiem For A Dream.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The Wicked soundtrack while utterly amazing cannot hold a candle to the live performance.  The vocals in this musical range from peppy songs like Popular to soaring ballads like As Long as your Mine and amazing songs that test all ranges such as Defying Gravity.  Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenoweth voices are breathtaking as they explore the story of the two girls who grow up to be the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good.  The soundtrack has the ability to be listened to many times without tireing of the amazing performances and brilliantly crafted music by Stephen Schwartz and the spectacular pit orchestra.
B000051VWW|5.0|Love this album, but it's lacking certain things.  No instrumental solos, tempos are consistently too slow.  You know, no hot sax solos, no guitar solos, no drum solos.  What's the matter?  In places where the band should've been kicking, they kill time with noodling long tones or sprinkles of notes, particularly from the keyboard.  The tunes are good and Sade's vocals are fine, but the band seems to be playing inside a straitjacket.  Also, I always hear Sade's music as background in stores, shopping malls, banks, etc.  I hear tunes from all of her albums, except this one.  The band let her down on this one, but probably the decision for them to play softly like this came from the producers.  Why?  And get rid of the drum machine!!!
0553260111|5.0|First off, if you're here reading this because the movie's attracted you, let me say that this book is completely different than the movie both in minor details (Marie is Canadian in the book and German in the movie) and in major plot lines (ah, can't tell you that, can I?). <br />The book is fantastic and (although Ludlum was a producer of the movie version, and therefore must have ok'd it) such a better story than the movie. In it you meet Jason Bourne, a lost man with a lost memory.  You follow him as he looks for and finds clues to his true identity. <br />It's as suspenseful as they come.  This hefty tome was one of those I absolutely inhaled.  I'm a woman, by the way.  If that matters.  I was thrilled, enchanted, excited, and impressed by this book.   <br />There's a reason this book has been such a great seller for all these many years (+30).  It's got the substance and the storyline and the writing power of a good author behind it.
B00005JKNF|5.0|As a mystery, the movie stinks. The murder is pedestrian. The clues are obvious. The denoement is anti-climatic. However, the movie is about the characters and is a period piece. The movie introduces dozens of characters: both servants and their masters. Amazingly, Altman gets you interested in most of the characters. The movie goes between the upstairs people and the downstairs people and how their lives are separate on the surface, but are deeply intertwined. It reminds me of \\"Rear Window\\" a little bit, where the murder is really only a device to introduce the various plot lines.      Altman indicates in the director's commentary it was meant to be seen several times. He also introduces profanity to move it into a \\"R\\" rating. The profanity wasn't obtrusive. I hear more in my work place every day. The goal of the R rating is that he didn't want teenagers seeing it; this movie isn't meant for them. The movie expects the viewer to be observant and to not pick up everything the first time. There is an emotional and a psychological depth to the film.     There is beauty in the details of the film. The sets are spectacular. The wardrobe is amazing. Even the lighting is interesting. Everything is researched: how the servants set the table, how the boots are shined, and how the class system among the servant ranks is almost more rigid than their masters'.     The movie is fun and makes me smile. The director's commentary in the DVD starts off slow, but slowly delivers interesting details. In this day of endless cop movies with silly car chases and explosions, this movie entertains.
B0000636UN|5.0|I have played this CD in my car continuously for weeks! I'm surprised I haven't worn it out yet. I highly recommend it.
6305657939|4.0|As of this writing, Pierce Brosnan may not play \\"James Bond\\" again, so if you are going through withdraws or just want to get over Brosnan as \\"Bond\\" and see him play a bad guy, you can see this remake movie of the 1968 film, \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\".  Brosnan is not \\"James Bond\\" in this one (but the moves are still there), but he is very clever at stealing valuable paintings from the local museum.  He never gets caught and can walk out with out suspicion, so he thinks.  He meets Rene Russo.  He tells her to pick any painting in the museum.  He steals that too.  He also can transfer assets illegally.
B00005JMEW|5.0|The samarai scene between the two ex-assassins was so beautiful I felt emotional.  Honestly, I thought I might start crying.  This movie is beautiful and powerful.  I don't particularly care for all the extra blood that comes literally spurting out of peoples' headless necks.  I'm not a comic book fan by any stretch.  I can, however, relate to the idea of wanting to seek revenge for someone killing my groom, my wedding party, and my baby (unborn, no less). She's a bad bad fighter.  She really is.  The samarai sword scenes are amazing.  I'm a female, by the way, although this comes off as a male movie.  I recommend this flick.  The storyline is good.  The characters are developed.  They are not shallow; they are just quiet. Uma plays off being a stupid American tourist in Japan quite well; she also pulls off the ex-assassin bit very well. <br />It's gory.  Don't watch it with your three year old. <br />
B00005JMAH|2.0|I, too, enjoyed movies one and two much more than number three.  The new director has destroyed the magic.  Hogwarts School is not a muggle inner city school with its sloppiness and lack of respect.  Hogwarts is the best wizard school in the world and should have the airs that go with that title.  I understand that the original castle was sold and a new castle was needed, but did they have to select a castle whose lands were so rocky and hilly?  It looked more like Scotland than England.  There was very little magic and no depth.  This could have been the best movie yet, but the new director blew it royally.  This is the most \\"Hollywood\\" type movie, which I don't think it needed to be.  Unless you've read the book, the movie won't make sense.  Harry Potter books and movies are meant for children, not adults.  Maybe the director should have targeted that audience and not have tried to impress adults with too many special effects and muggle-izations.  For under $20, this movie is worth buying - even if just to keep the collection whole.
B0000AGWJ7|4.0|I got sucked in by music television! I saw Avenged Sevenfold's video on Fuse and I bought this album a few days later.  What a disappointment!  Now, I listen to a lot of music including various genres of metal so I like to think that I'm knowledgeable and capable of making fairly good judgements on artists and albums.  While these boys have potential, their music isn't quite what it should be.  When I listen to it, it simply leaves me hanging, wanting just a bit more than they are willing to give.  Musically, this album is simply tiresome:  boringly clich guitar riffs and a lead singer who insists on singing in a demonic cookie monster scream when his clean vocals are move powerful and gloriously mournful.  Lyrically, they exhibit more originalityy than your average up-and-coming metal band but it certainly does not make up for the musical disappointments abounding.  <br /> <br />You're wondering why I gave this album 4-stars, right? <br /> <br />Two reasons. <br />1) They have potential and I have hope. <br />2) I saw them play at the Vans Warped Tour 2004 and they blew me away.  Their performance was other-worldy.  I will continue to buy their albums--even if their music isn't phenomenal, their live show is inspiring, gothic and it makes it quite apparent that these boys love what they do.  I know that one day soon Avenged Sevenfold will produce the album that I've been dreaming of for them.
B0002IU988|2.0|I have listened to this cd front 1 to 11 about 4 times.  I can honestly say that there are two songs that our tolerable.  I cannot believe they settled for this guy.  I can honestly say after listening to this album the 4th time that I had to rip it out of my cd player and gave it to my wife without a burning a copy.  His voice is annoying and the tone is awful.  I was a huge Creed fan, although, Scott's head got as big as a blimp there is no doubting his talent.  I like the lyrics, music and this would have been an amazing album with Scott or someone who had a mans voice, instead of the constant squill of a karaoke singer.  MT wrote some great songs, great riffs, but wasted his time auditioning and picking this guy.  I predict he won't be on the next album!
B00020HEG6|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the best movie soundtrack I've ever heard of! If you have not bought it yet, you are truly missing out! My favorite song is, undoubtedly, A Window to the Past, because of it's simple beauty. But the whole CD in itself is brilliant! YOU MUST HAVE IT! It really captures what is going on through the film.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I have never written an online review of anything, but when I saw the average for this one was less than five stars, I figured I should add my two cents. This is by far one of the best albums I have EVER heard and I play it all the time! It's extremely romantic, soothing and warm. Take some advice -- buy this and then just sit with someone you love and listen to it. It will be one of the best evenings of your life.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|This is a beautiful soundtrack. I've listened to it numerous times, never piecemeal, but always the entire CD in one sitting. I still find it as fresh and moving as when I first heard it. As is the fashion for epic soundtracks, Zimmer utilizes 'native' elements in his score - in this case, Japanese wind and percussion instruments. He also made use of Japanese vocals - no, not mellifluous humming as in 'Gladiator' - but rather victory shouts or war cries. It is quite effective as it appears at the arrival of the triumphant samurai battle theme. Perhaps this soundtrack's most beautiful quality is the infusion of Zen-like stillness which, coupled with the musical characterization of Algren's melancholy spirit, creates a wondrous cathartic effect. Undoubtedly 'Gladiator' will remain Zimmer's most popular soundtrack. My favorite, however, is \\"The Last Samurai\\".
6305971099|5.0|Halloween 5, The Curse of Michael Myers, picks right up where part four left off. Jaime, Michael's niece, inadvertenly touched him just before the police blew him away in a bed of dynamite. Consequently, his troubled spirit possessed this innocent eight year old girl and forced her to stab her foster mother on Halloween night.<br /><br />One year later, Jaime is a patient in a mental hospital for children. She suffers from nightmares, seizures, and she has lost the ability to speak. What she has been left with is the psychic ability to learn when her psychotic uncle is about to strike again. (He survived the explosion)Jaime's foster mom survived the attack and now she and her husband are off on a holiday, leaving their daughter Rachel behind for a day or so and she is about to join them. Feeling guilty about leaving Jaime, Rachel and her best friend Tina visit her in the hospital with their new dog, a sweet but protective Doberman Pinscher named Max.<br /><br />Back at the house, while Rachel is getting dressed to join her parents, she ignores Max's barked warnings and ends up being a victim of Michael's. Meanwhile, Jaime is participating in a Halloween pageant at the hospital when she gets the feeling that Michael is now after Tina, who is living it up at a high school Halloween party. Tina ends up sacrificing herself to save the little girl, but the chase doesn't end there. Dr. Loomis wants to get Michael home, hoping that will tame some of his rage against his family. And poor Jaime ends up being the bait. Will she survive?<br /><br />Every year around Halloween I try to catch this movie on American Movie Classics. It's not as good as the original, which still has me looking over my shoudler every time I watch it, but still, the story is rich with suspense around every corner. Jaime, unlike her uncle, isn't a mad girl but rather the innocent victim of an unleashed spirit looking to wreak havoc on this small town. My favorite quote comes from one of the characters, \\"They oughta ban Halloween in this town.\\" But if they did, then the movies wouldn't be as much fun as they are.<br /><br />Happy Halloween!aracters, \\"They oughta ban Halloween in this town.\\" But if they did, then the movies wouldn't be as much fun as they are.  <br /> <br />Happy Halloween!
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Which is for the better, I think. <br /> <br />This is the type of album, for me, that I don't think about when I'm not listening to it. When I don't listen, I regret that I bought it. But when I listen, I thoroughly enjoy it. Definitely catchy, in a very fun, bouncy way, as has been said dozens of times here. <br /> <br />This album is not a necessity, but if you don't listen to it that much, it is a treat when you do.
B00004WG2F|3.0|The DVD would get 5 stars because the movie is great, however the picture isn't. Spots of dust (which flash on the screen as white specks) show up in the picture too often for my taste. The studio didn't bother cleaning it up before producing the DVD. Every time a white speck/dot shows up boy does it spoil the experience for me. Don't get me wrong, it's not a constant thing -- but it's enough. I don't know about the rest of you but I expect perfection in this day and age.
0440241413|1.0|I found this book terribly dull and repetitive.  After 100 pages of the \\"heroine\\" trying to convince herself that every 50 pounds (about $100) spent on an unnecessary item is money well spent, I couldn't stomach any more.  I didn't find her rationalizations and lying amusing, just annoying.  She is materialistic and quite an airhead, and I couldn't give a darn about her.  I was looking forward to a light summer read, but in this one, nothing much ever seems to happen, besides her spending money, detailing what she's spent it on, and vacillating between chastising herself for it or rationalizing it.  The other people she interacts with seem to matter little to her, and it makes it hard for the reader to care, either.  I am surprised so many people enjoyed this book so much!
B00006IX0R|5.0|This is my first (and presently, only) album by the Cranberries. The only difficulty this CD poses is a slight barrier to my assimilation of all their CDs - many songs on other albums are already on this CD. That's my biggest problem with compilation CDs. <br /> <br />That being said, I love every song on this CD. I was practically addicted to it when my sister first bought it, and I know she was. It was difficult to go a day without listening to it (I am not one to listen to a CD twice in one day). <br /> <br />The lyrics and music evoke such a distinct feeling; they strangely pinpointed some of the indescribable emotions and ideas (not profound, necessarily, just unusual) I was experiencing at the time we first got the CD. <br /> <br />The songs are haunting and catchy, but what with an individual edge that brings each piece wrenching emotion. <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite CDs. I cannot be objective.
B0000A1RJI|3.0|There is a difference between a \\"Score\\" and \\"Highlights From\\". I was expecting the score to the movie, which this is not.  There are major sections of music missing, and pieces are out of order.  While the music itself is magnificent - powerful and moving - the arrangement leaves too much to be desired.  If you are like me and love to relive a story through music, this CD will disappoint you.
B00000612P|5.0|1971 found Mr. Rodney Stewart in a ridiculously, creative, productive, and not to say lucrative mind. In 1970 he already released two solo albums, which were all but Faces albums in name only, `An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down' and `Gasoline Alley', and one album fully credited to the Faces `First Step'. But 1971 saw the Faces - and particularly their lead singer - shoot to stardom beyond their wildest dreams.<br /><br />First there was their first top thirty album on both sides of the Atlantic with `Long Player'. Then the first single from Rod Stewart's new solo album 'Maggie May' went number one worldwide followed by the release of `Every Picture Tells A Story`, which followed the single to a worldwide number one. This was topped off with another Faces album that again followed the previous album to number one, `A Nod's As Good As A Wink To A Blind Horse'. They crammed all this in while doing hundreds of magical concerts all over the world.<br /><br />To record `Every Picture Tells a Story' Rod Stewart surrounded himself with his mates, wrote two new songs with Faces' mate Ronnie Wood, the title track and album opener, and one with Martin Quittenton, 'Maggie May'. The rest were all perfectly selected covers. Some songs make you want to leap up and hug someone and some will bring you to emotional tears; Rod Stewart lets all his Sam Cooke influences hang out.<br /><br />The title track is brought to a dramatic finale with Maggie Bell of Stone-the- Crows fame in a grand style duet with Rodney.  The chorus lines in 'Seems Like a Long Time' are given a great touch by Madeleine Bell and old `Steampacket' buddy Long John Baldrey as Rodney slows it all down.<br /><br />The version of Arthur Crudup's 'That's Alright' gives a huge nod of affection to Elvis, and Bob Dylan has never been covered better than 'Tomorrow Is Such A Long Time'.<br /><br />'Amazing Grace' lives up to its name with some of the best slide guitar that Ronnie Wood has ever laid down in the studio, and gives great emphasis to Rod Stewarts vocals.<br /><br />Then we get 'Maggie May', an all-time classic. The autobiographical song about a young Rodney Stewart losing his virginity, was given its first showcase on the British T.V. program Top Of The Pops. Rod Stewart, backed by his trusty Faces and various monkey suited roadies, and D.J. John Peel (a non-musician) attempting to look like he could play the wonderful Ray Jackman mandolin solo with all the others mugged up behind him, had a whale of a time kicking balloons into the crowd; none of them bothering to hide the fact that they were only miming to the track. The conservative British Broadcasting Company were not amused, but they won the hearts of a nation.<br /><br />'Mandolin Wind' is played to perfection with Ray Jackman of Lindisfarne, again staring with his mandolin playing.<br /><br />'(I Know) I'm Losing You' is probably the heaviest rocker that Rodney or the Faces ever played and used to bring their stage show to a riotous conclusion. Micky Waller, who plays drums on all the tracks on 'Every Picture', would surely have made a better drummer with the Faces than the rather rigid Kenny Jones; he propels `(I Know) I'm Losing You' along with tremendous power.<br /><br />Tim Hardin's 'Reason To Believe' brings the album to a beautiful conclusion.<br /><br />If you want to hear Rod Stewart singing at his best, this is it.  That was before he disbanded the Faces and got out his leotards to ask you `Don't Ya Think I'm Sexy?' and all the other rubbish he flooded us later in the seventies. But anything is forgivable to an artist that can come out with a slice of perfection like 'Every Picture Tells A Story'. 1971 was a good year indeed.<br /><br />Pranced by Mott the Dog<br /><br />Preened by Ella Crewwn in the studio, and gives great emphasis to Rod Stewarts vocals.  <br /> <br />Then we get 'Maggie May', an all-time classic.

B0002IU988|5.0|The music and the vocals on this recording are fantastic!  I knew that Mark Tremonti could play but, wow. Myles Kennedy is an outstanding singer, what a vocal range.  All musicians grow and evolve as they mature, for Tremonti, Flip, and Marshall the departure of their former front man was exactly what they needed to grow.  Alter Bridge is a wonderful evolution of Creed.
B00005QAPH|5.0|I've been re-watching Fellini's 8 1/2 with all the commentaries... supposedly this is a \\"film about film\\". But, I think, it is a film about love. <br />Even the title, I think is about the women in his life. Throughout the movie the director-protagonist is beseiged by reporters and critics asking about his new film and one of the repeated questions is, \\"Why don't you make a film about love?\\". His friend's neice teases him that he does not know how. <br />Well, I think, this is how this film started- was the story Frederico was trying to tell but, as Guido agonizes to his sister at the rocket launch platform, he has lost his way. He wanted to tell such a simple story, \\"No lies at all. One that would help people bury forever all these dead things we carry around.\\"  <br />     The \\"perfect woman\\" who appears to him at the spa's healing spring and gives him water is the actress later walking through the streets with him as he agonizes over his life. She tells him then that he does not know how to love. <br />Oh, sad heart, sad heart, he is Everyman. <br />We can see the reasons for this as we are taken through his childhood memories, the stark role divisions, the repressive Catholic torture and Madonna/Whore template. <br />His sister is his best connection to his soul from their childhood games of asa nisa masa (ai ni ma) to her adult connection to Spirit being who tells him, \\"You are free-but you must choose And you don't have much time.\\". <br />The actress who plays the director's mistress in the film was actually Fellini's mistress for 17 years. The interview with her is AMAZING!  <br />The ending of the film was changed at the last minute-it was originally going to be the protagonist in a dream-visualization seeing all the women of his life together in a dining car, not the parade ending. Did Fellini chicken out, not wanting to give himself away too brazenly, or did he himself even realize what his film was about???  <br /> <br />1. Grandmother <br />2. Mother <br/>3.Saraghina <br />4. Wife <br />5.Mistress <br />6.Sister <br />7.Friend's mistress (gloria) <br />8. The woman at the Spring <br />1/2. the Next Woman(in the Harem scene he asks, \\"But who are you?\\") <br />------------------- <br />I think, the most important thing in this world is to learn how to truly love. To open ourselves deep enough to share a living dream of love, freedom, creativity, divinity. To learn to live this knowledge of the Soul in real life. <br />Yeah, I think, it's the only Revolution that will save the world.  <br />And, in such a subliminal way, this is what comes across in this film. <br /> <br />

B000005RTG|4.0|no it is not true that Come Taste The Band was dissapointing many Deep Purple fans,.....you do not understand the Mk IV line up - Purple Musical evolution. I 'm the one who love this album so much,....Tommy Bolin was a unique replacement for Blackmore in 1975 and brought a new blood and new style in the Purple body. One cannot blame him because he was not Ritchie Blackmore.  <br />The songs like You keep on moving, Lady luck, dealer, this time around- owed to G are damned good. If you are listening to ON THE WINGS OF RUSSIAN FOXBAT 1976 - DP MK IV live album,...you will be stunned by the pretty performance the band did in 1976. <br /> <br />PS: only fool rock fans who are saying Come taste the band is a bad one! cheers deep purple dramatician and fans J Utama
B00003CXDB|1.0|I didn't like this movie. It was VERY dull and confusing, and it was nearly impossible to relate to, sympathize with or understand any of the characters. The acting was pretty good, but overall I just couldn't wait for the movie to be over!
B00004ZAV3|2.0|the songs are not new, but remastered again and again! it is a fact that McCartney and Ringo Starr still need money from all Beatle fans!! They always make their \\"Compilation Best of\\" for almost every two years. How many Beatles recordings will be remastered continuerly again? I said WHAT A MONEY MAKER!!! <br />PS:  <br />Deep Purple one the greatest Hardrock contemporary on earth is on the studio again by producing their new album BANANAS. The Purple new album has composed most of good songs and freshing sounds....Deep Purple is also an old band like Beatles and Stones, but they always produce new LPs and albums for their fans. As a result the PURPLE new album BANANAS got many good critics....see the reviews of BANANAS!!!

0385720920|3.0|Oh yeah...the inside is really good too.<br /><br />Vic is a nutcase sex addict. You don't have to be a nutcase to be a sex addict, but he pulls it all off pretty well. He's a player in a Civil War reenactment troup and a med school drop out. But once in awhile he meets other sex addicted females for a little give and take. When he's not doing these things, he's faking choking to death in various eating establishments to get a little attention. As a result of his exploits, the people who end up saving him are somehow duty-bound to send him money every month in probably the most unrealistic and impossible to believe side points of the book.<br /><br />Aside from that, Chucky has put together a thoroughly readable piece that has some really nice subplots and the occasional twists and turns. I liked it a lot and if you're a fan of the writer, you will like this book better than most of his others.
B000001FZK|5.0|It's always nice to see a rather sub-par band reinvent themselves into a great band, but this feat is a rare find. Sure, people always mention Radiohead, but they only had one \\"poor\\" record to their credit (Pablo Honey). More recently, Silverchair was touted as having abandoned their \\"kiddie grunge\\" schtick, but the results were more admirable than actually good with their record Diorama coming off as sort-of a schmaltzy Soft Bulletin.  <br />Talk Talk on their other hand started out as a bad synth-pop band. They really weren't that good. Like, I have a soft spot for synth-pop (Depeche Mode, Soft Cell, Human League, etc.), but the old Talk Talk material was just so derivative and unengaging that it made Duran Duran seem rather forward-thinking. <br />But somewhere around Spirit Of Eden, Talk Talk became a different band entirely. And by Laughing Stock, they were incredible. The best part, though, was just how good they had become. This wasn't just an admirable work; this was brilliance on its own terms. Laughing Stock was, and still is, a wholly beautiful, original, and timeless master-stroke from a band that overhauled their old sound for something that fell between the lines of jazz and what would become post-rock. <br />The record is a subtly building one; one that skirts dangerously close to being lethargic, yet is much too powerful to ever fall victim to laziness. The opener \\"Myrrhman\\" is an almost ambient-like piece complete with quiet horns and a lack of percussion. Mark Hollis' vocal stands out immediately as incredibly soulful and expressive, a trait that would work to the band's advantage. <br />Tracks such as \\"Ascension Day,\\" \\"After The Flood\\" and \\"New Grass\\" stake out territory to be futher explored by the 90's post rock scene, serving as a template for the ground bands like Slint and Tortoise would explore. The loud guitars in \\"Ascension Day\\" and the atonal noise in \\"After The Flood\\" are introduced in the least pretentious and self-concious manner. Fora band that was once geared towards exploiting the popularity of Duran Duran and their ilk, the use of jarringly abrasive touches more suited to bands like Sonic Youth is startling, but it never feels out-of-place. <br />Laughing Stock is an album's album, a piece that needs to be listened to in one sitting. It takes patience and attention to reap its rewards. The best things about Laughing Stock though is that it's not a band finding genius in comparison to its past work, but a band finding genius on its own terms, divorced from the missteps of their past.
0743424425|5.0|One of the best from the stable of the King.
B000002UAR|5.0|I think the only thing more annoying than overrating the Beatles is underrating them. Really, you're not being that original or shocking by claiming to \\"hate\\" The Beatles. And it's one thing if you just don't like them, but you should still hold appreciation for them simply because they are probably responsible in some way for the existence of your favorite band. A lot of the one-star reviews I've seen here seem simply haphazard, as if the reviewers were writing off The Beatles before even listening to them. And it takes more than one listen to a record like Revolver for it to sink in for people like me spoiled by frequent advances in rock music. But really, to write this off as \\"pop garbage\\" is like writing off Louis Armstrong simply because of the stylistic advances made by jazz musicians like John Coltrane and Charlie Parker. Yes, I know \\"pop\\" has negative connotations in this modern world, but not all \\"pop\\" refers to dreck mass-produced by some talentless CEO. And The Beatles were proof-positive that pop music could be a forward thinking genre. And it's much better than any of that self-important prog-rock nonsense that came about in the 1970's. <br />I'm not saying you have to think that The Beatles are the best band of all-time, but to not give them a fair chance is just ridiculous and narrow-minded. And in fact, I like Rubber Soul better than Revolver, and The White Album might be my favorite Beatles record. But even these young ears can recognize Revolver as being a brilliant album.
B0001V6ZJ8|4.0|The characters and plot of Huston's 1952 ground-breaker can't be confused with  Nicole Kidman's 2001 contrived schlock, nor will this revived classic be to everyone's taste.  It's strictly an art-house product, though it earned big bucks in '52 and much critical acclaim.  Like many Huston works, it refuses to become dated. Still, in hindsight, Ferrer's Toulouse-Lautrec is a brilliant but oddly remote portrayal (an odd mix that characterized Ferrer). The real Lautrec was an artistic  outlaw of his day, a complex, talented, intractable rebel whose work was often considered pornographic (if only those critics could see Nicole's movies!) but who helped change 19th century sensibilities and even invented new printing processes. I think Ferrer plays him a little hard, but many might disagree.  The editing seems rushed and choppy (having been finished mere hours before the film's debut); Suzanne Flon's playing of Myriamme flatly steals female honors from Colette Marchand, who wildly overplays Marie Charlet.  Zsa Zsa Gabor's singing is flagrantly dubbed -- but \\"Bubbles, Bangles\\" is still a hauntingly lovely tune.  Flaws aside, this movie has many seriously brilliant moments.  Contrary to most Hollywood bio's of the era, Huston's Lautrec is unsanitized and unglamorous.  The color is simply terrific, with many shots worthy of a gallery showing.  Huston flaunted Technicolor's usual rules, creating images the way artists use paint, though the result often looks more like Matisse than Lautrec. I noted a bit of flicker in some sequences, visible on 3 DVD players.  But few films approach the immersive color of many M.R. images, originally processed in British Technicolor.  Some  disappointments: with so much fascinating history behind the film's crew and the story's real-life characters, the only extra is a poorly rendered trailer.  Some  segments of audio are distorted.  And the script wasn't all that great (though it easily trounces the 2001 insult).  Not Huston's best film, buta landmark that seldom fails to fascinate and which is essential to every film buff's collection.
B000002AP1|5.0|Listening to Raw Power makes me hate the garage rock-revival scene. It all sounds so safe and so carefully calculated, thus completely losing the amaturishness and spontaniety that made garage rock so lovable. Raw Power is garage rock torn apart and reassembled in the most haphazard way possible. And that's a compliment. It's the first punk record: abrasive, uncomprimising, dirty, violent, and unpretentious. Iggy Pop alternates between a nasal drawl and a jagged bark. Ron Asheton's guitar completely obliterates everything in its path. This is what rock n' roll was meant to be, and it has everything that rock lost when it became a marketable commodity. It's sloppy and filthy and perfect. You know that a record has to be great when even a \\"ballad\\" like \\"Gimme Danger\\" rocks harder than the entire output of most modern punk bands.
B00005JLSE|2.0|Despite the fact that Richard Gere was able to successfully contort himself into an acceptable musical performer, 'Chicago' was and remains a prime example of how to glorify superficiality into a money-making product (and Gere's character can testify that this formula really works!). Populated with characters no one could like, the musical's stage success was based almost entirely on the songs and Fosse's ingenious choreography. Having seen both the original and its revival on the New York stage, I must say that the film is a huge disappointment (and that doesn't count the so-so video quality or the strained treble on audio).  Some of the original music was deleted (why?).  Worst of all, every one of Fosse's brilliant dance designs has been ruined with frenetic MTV-style cross-cutting, annihilating every movement rhythm and Fosse's seductive mix of garishness and pointed subtlety. This is strictly a musical for those who haven't seen great musicals, particularly those who haven't seen how accomplished movie-musical directors photograph great dance numbers (Check 'Kiss Me Kate' or the unedited 'Begin the Beguine' production number near the end of 'Broadway Melody of 1940' to see how it's done).  As they usually say about Hollywood adaptations of great stage musicals, the original was better.

Then I found out that FOX was airing all the episodes out of order, and that made me more confused, and mad.  Fox network was off their nut the way they treated this brilliant show.  It's just, well, shiny!  The commentaries are funny and enlightening, as are the extras.  I do wish there were more commentaries, but I'm thankful for what I've got.  This is what TV should be.  Buy the DVD!!  Set your clocks for April 2005 for Serenity the movie!!
B00023B1LC|3.0|Who is Jason Bourne? And more importantly, will you care by the finale of this limp action flick? Starring Matt Damon as a guy with no past and no identity, \\"The Bourne Identity\\" strives to be a thinking man's action flick and only ends up being another mediocre shoot-'em-up, with Damon's earnest performance as one of the few highlights.<br /><br />A man (Matt Damon) is found floating in the ocean, and is picked up by a rickety fishing boat. He has no memory of who he is, or why there are a couple of bullets lodged in his back. He sets out on a journey to find out who he is, uncovering a gun, the name Jason Bourne, and a lot of money in Zurich. Unfortunately, very deadly people seem to creeping out of the woodwork to kill him.<br /><br />He picks up a rather clueless traveller (Franka Potente), who agrees to drive him to where he wants to go. (Why doesn't he drive himself?) But as Bourne keeps uncovering clues about his past, he learns that his past is as an assassin -- and it seems to be his old boss who now wants him dead, gone and forgotten. Only Bourne doesn't plan to go down without a fight. (Or a sequel film)<br /><br />Don't worry, James -- \\"Bourne Identity\\" doesn't threaten the Bond franchise. It feels like a bunch of loosely strung-together action scenes with a lot of cinematic flourishes. \\"Wow! Check out THIS cool scene!\\" director Doug Liman seems to be constantly saying. But unfortunately it makes for a rather dull action flick -- and definitely not a smart or suspenseful one.<br /><br />The scriptwork and direction are pretty mediocre. Liman adds little to the proceedings, although some of the camerawork -- such as the car bumping down a staircase -- is fairly thrilling. Unfortunately, he uses his little tricks too often, and soon you'll be craving something a little slower and more complicated, rather than a string of action flourishes.<br /><br />And the script itself feels half-baked. More character development and \\"quiet moments\\" between action scenes would have brought everything to life. But the few moments of character development are hurried, so we can see Damon beat up a few more thugs. Suspense? Not much at all -- the Bourne identity is painfully obvious.<br /><br />Matt Damon does seem to be giving it his best as Bourne. While his acting is so-so, and his character feels incomplete, he does look like he's giving it his all. Franka Potente is forgettable as the token love interest; all Marie does is go to bed with Bourne, and react to every crisis by tottering around with her eyes and mouth wide open. And Julia Stiles fans had better not blink, or they might miss her role.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Identity\\" strains to be a smart, sexy, tightly-wound thriller, but only becomes an an average wad of summer shoot-'em-up brain candy.

B000286RKW|5.0|Like a lot of other users, I was thrilled to hear this was finally out on a decent DVD and got it immediately. Two things to note, however, in response to claims that Martin Scorsese was trying to cheat people by releasing the film twice: <br /> <br />1) Releasing a DVD is not the director's decision, it's the studio's. It's naive to believe he orchestrated releasing it twice. <br /> <br />2) When the first DVD was released, technology was nowhere near what it is now. If you learn anything about DVDs you will realize that they are constantly finding ways to fit more and more material in less physical space, meaning you can fit a lot more movie and extras on a single disk than you used to be able to. <br /> <br />Also, anyone who thinks Scorsese hurts the image of Italians has never seen MY VOYAGE TO ITALY, where he offers a true treat of clips from his favorite Italian films by the masters. The man loves movies, and makes great ones. I've never met anyone who thinks Italians are killers or thieves because of Mob movies.

B000002LK1|5.0|1990 marked the release of Depeche Mode's Violator, the record that contains the band's most successful, chart-climbing singles (\\"Personal Jesus,\\" \\"Enjoy the Silence\\") and made DM a household name. This record isn't their most groundbreaking, but contains the band's best songwriting of its career and has consequently become THE quintessential synth-pop masterpiece.<br /><br />Anyone who owns some of DM's other albums will tell you that, despite extremely impressive overall quality, not every song is perfect. There are usually a couple filler songs, half-ideas, or just plain failed sonic experimentations per album (fortunately, the better songs on the albums almost totally eclipse their weaker moments). Violator, however, is the exception. Every song is perfect, and the album works as a cohesive whole unlike any other DM record.<br /><br />The album starts with the groovy, danceable \\"World in my eyes,\\" moving on to the moodier, love-struck-but-cautious \\"Sweetest Perfection.\\" \\"Personal Jesus\\" is one of the album's big hits, and it's easy to see why. The infectious guitar line layered over the song's synthy atmosphere makes for an evilly catchy single that marked a whole new sound for DM at the time. The album's lush, gorgeous, drumless centerpiece \\"Waiting for the night\\" slowly adds layers of synths and effects to its stark beginnings, steadily building, but never climaxing. It instead opts to quietly fade, serenely ending what is perhaps the most memorable track on the album. \\"Enjoy the silence\\" is the album's other big hit, as well as DM's most successful single to date. \\"Policy of truth\\" has got to be the catchiest, most anthemic song on Violator, while the almost creepy \\"Blue Dress\\" and the album's darkest track \\"Clean\\" take you on a roller coaster of emotions before ending the ride that is Violator.<br /><br />If you're new to Depeche Mode, Violator is a perfect introduction for neophytes. If you consider yourself a fan of bands such as the Cure, the Smiths, New Order, or even Duran Duran, Violator is absolutely essential.s, New Order, or even Duran Duran, Violator is absolutely essential. <br />
B0002KVUKM|5.0|As a \\"classic Horror\\" fan who grew up in the '60's, I really expected very little from this movie....other than \\"billion dollar\\" special effects. Well...that was delivered and so much more. My two teenage sons loved this movie and so did I. The characters portrayed were done so with skill and articulation...the story line was effective and and \\"to the point\\". The special effects were amazing but did not overtake the story being told. I am looking forward to the release of this DVD...as are my kids! It will be a welcome addition to our collection of \\"monster movies\\". I'm sure Mr. Karloff himself would whole-heartedly approve.
0380789035|5.0|I give this book the highest praise I can imagine - I felt like a kid discovering Zelazny's world of Amber as I read it.  I'll be checking out Gaiman's other novels.  Highly recommended.
B00005JKCH|5.0|When I was a kid, I was a regular viewer of the Spiderman cartoons on TV.  I thought the whole \\"secret identity superhero\\" thing was just too cool for words.  Well, here I am a quarter century later, and behold! my favorite comic book hero has hit the big screen.<br /><br />Now, I'm not normally a big fan of comic book movies, and in fact this one (and its sequel) are the only ones I have watched.  I don't want to be like some reviewers and read too much into this movie.  I doubt the producers were all that concerned about delving into Peter Parker's psyche as they were in just telling a good story.  They have definitely succeeded on the latter count!<br /><br />I think this movie is a wonderfully entertaining adaptation of the comic books and cartoons I loved as a 12 year old boy.  Sure, the serious afficionado can find some details to quibble over, but overall I was very impressed with the way the Spiderman legend was brought vividly to life.  I especially enjoyed the way the actors were made to look just like their comic book counterparts.  Even better, the outlandish story lines from the comics were actually imbued with an air of -- dare I say it? -- plausibility.  In short, it's everything I had hoped for in this kind of film, and then some.<br /><br />For all you \\"serious\\" movie critics out there who want to overanalyze this movie, just get over yourselves!  This was intended to be pure fun and fantasy, and it was definitely that.  It's a wild ride from the beginning to end.  Enjoy it!  I certainly did.

B00008EY65|4.0|Let me preface my review for these \\"critics\\" out there trashing this movie. I'm into sci-fi. I'm a huge fan. VERY HUGE!!!  I also think that if you're not a true fan of a particular genre, you shouldn't rate a film, book, CD or anything else.  The fact that you can generally find fault with things you don't have a background in doesn't qualify you as a critic -- it only makes you an opinionated idiot!!  Probably, the same opinionated idiot that recommended \\"Moulin Rouge\\" for all those Oscars!!  And that movie sucked -- and that's MY idiotic opinion!!!<br /><br />Having said that,  I know this wasn't a perfect film. The storyline got lost at times and some of the plot development went through the cracks. But I didn't go to see this movie for the cerebral meaning of life. I didn't go see this movie expecting 8 Academy Award nominations.  I went to see a sci-fi movie with a lot of action and destruction, a like-able hero and a hate-able villain, and wisecracks and killing and, if it happened, a plot where all would be resolved in the last frame. I got that with this movie.  If you expect to see more than that, then you're going to be watching the wrong movie.<br /><br />All the elements worked for me in this movie. As I said, the plot and storyline had some gaps.  But, as with any adaptation, it's hard to fill in all the blanks in the scope of a 90-minute movie. Some things won't be covered. It's like all the intricacies of Peter Parker/Spiderman . . . there's a lot the movie can't explain the first time around. A lot of blanks were filled in the second movie.  But you really had to have some background in the comic book for full effect.<br /><br />I had no background in the Hellboy comics (I haven't read the comics in 30 years), so I went into this cold. But I warmed to it very quickly.  The sardonic Hellboy could only be played by Perlman -- who is lucky not to have developed a latex allergy for all the characters he's played in makeup.  The amphibian hero was excellent for comic relief, but didn't have much camera time . . . maybe if there's a sequel, he'll get to show off more.<br /><br />Rasputin made an implausible villain, but the actor did a reputable job of being loathsome. It's always fun to beat the Nazis, so this was a pretty good premise.  Not too believable, but that's why it's called science FICTION!!<br /><br />Overall, I give this high marks for the entertainment factor. If it lags in a few areas, it still hits the mark for action and destruction and all the stuff that makes for a good action hero flick.  Even when the hero is sarcastic and ill-tempered.<br /><br />My Closing Message To The Critics:  Get this movie and some popcorn and enjoy it for what it is -- not for what you want it to be.excellent for comic relief, but didn't have much camera time . . . maybe if there's a sequel, he'll get to show off more. <br /> <br />Rasputin made an implausible villain, but the actor did a reputable job of being loathsome.

B0002TT0NW|3.0|If you want to see a good movie, this is one to see.  If you want to see a movie recreation of the 3rd book in the Harry Potter series, do not waste your time.  This movie has everything that a big blockbuster movie has... great acting and phenomenal special effects.  However its attempt to follow the book are very lacking.  There is one scene that was not in the book and I am still wondering why it was added to the movie because it does nothing for the story.  The sequnce of events in the book was very different than in the movie. <br /> <br />I did like the movie for it own sake.  However, I was very disappointed since the first two movie followed the books very closely, that this one did not. <br />
B0002KVUKM|4.0|A Word To The Critics: If you're not into the genre, don't rate the film. This movie was panned so badly by every conceivable movie critic (except Ebert), it's a wonder anyone went to see it at all.  The only people qualified to comment on how good/bad a movie is should only be done by people who enjoy that kind of movie. It was very obvious that the same boring people who thought \\"Moulin Rouge\\" was the best thing since \\"The Piano\\", should not go see a horror movie. They don't have a background to judge it.  They should leave that sort of thing to the people who get into it --- like me!! <br /> <br />I love a good horror movie. Especially a good vampire/monster movie. And when you have more than one . . . all I need is a bag of popcorn, a superlarge drink and some Milk Duds and my afternoon is set!!  This was not Oscar material, but it was a great vampire/monster movie.  I made it a point not to watch too many ads so I'd be genuinely surprised at the characters and the developing plot line. <br /> <br />I have a great many gay friends, so I feel at liberty to say this next statement. Dracula was a flaming queen.  I was left to wonder which of his minion was the \\"father\\" of all those bat babies. It surely wasn't him. All he needed was some blue eye shadow and a gown and he surely would have passed as queen of the ball.  I think a stronger Dracula presence was needed in the film --- of course, in casting, why wouldn't you have a more unassuming Dracula character, deceiving in his fopishness, while stronger and more ruthless than anyone could imagine?  Why not indeed.  So maybe it was a good choice after all. <br /> <br />The vampire brides were deliciously wicked. I think they were actually the highlight of the film.  When the first bat babies started dying in mid-flight, the girls' expressions and agony were comic yet tragic. I literally loved seeing them suffer!! The Frankenstein monster was a great pick as well.  He showed great humanity through the makeup. <br /><br />Of course, the stoic Jackman made a picture perfect Van Helsing. All business, no nonsense at first -- and then they humanize him after his wolfman encounter.  Very effective characterization.  In fact, each character (except Dracula) seemed custom-fitted to their roles. I sort of expected a dreary overcast backdrop for most of the movie, but was pleasantly surprised to see plenty of light so the CGI effects could be shown with maximum intensity and clarity.  It was good stuff. The transformation sequences were excellent;  some of the best of recent memory and on a par with \\"The Mummy\\" and \\"X-Men\\" effects. <br /> <br />In all, you get what you expect with this flick and more. But if you go in looking for the existential meaning of the inner core of humanity, forget it. This ain't that movie.  If you want to see a vampire movie with a twist or two, a werewolf movie with at least one plot line developed, a Frankenstein movie that doesn't degrade the intent of the original and a vampire hunter movie that doesn't disappoint, then you can get all four movies in one with this one. <br /> <br />Why 4 stars instead of 5??  Because it's hard to develop a movie from a comic book and keep the storyline and plot development on a par with a made for film story. There are some gaps here and there but that doesn't make it a bad movie.  <br /> <br />Will I buy it when it comes out?  Of course.
B00000J7SS|5.0|To think this album was made in the sixties is simply amazing. Every track on these two CD's are amazing, excellent and very very addictive. I listened to Spanish Key five times in a row and still enjoy it. The track Feio is hard to categorize there is a strange distorted synth sound in the back ground, sounds like something Autechre tried to duplicate in some of their albums. Bitches Brew is my favorite track very smooth and ominous sounding, then changes into a jazz freak-out, miles blasting out on trumpet, excellent stuff. This album started in '69? Wow... check it out if you want to know what good jazz sounds like!
B00009V7T2|5.0|A car accident caused this album.  When a friend of the band ended up in a coma, they took it upon themselves to dedicate and entire album to his condition.  Fortunately for us all, they succeeded in creating one of the best albums of its time.   <br />Including half of the members of At The Drive In, The Mars Volta shows signs of musicianship.  Modern rock is easily predicable, a verse, a chorus, annother verse, a chorus, sometimes a bridge, then annother chorus and an ending.  Listen to the radio, mostly every song will fit this format.  Members of rock bands can call themselves musicians because they perform and create music professionally, but what it comes down to is that most of these \\"musicians\\" know nothing about music.  When listening to The Mars Volta it becomes apparent that they do in fact know what it is they are doing.  These musicians use some of the most complicated parts together in a single song, and then somehow are able to do so for an entire cd.  <br />This is one of the few cds however that must be listened to from start to finish.  You can't really pick a track and listen to it without loosing effect.  It is that very effect that makes the cd so remarkable.   <br />My two cents?  Buy this cd, listen to it cover to cover, then make a decision about the band.  Don't download a song and say \\"its not for me\\" until you have heard them all.  It will be worth your 10 bucs.
0316168815|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. After reading it, I found that she had written another book called Lucky, which I'm in the middle of reading right now. I would definitly recommend this book to anyone. It's a sad story of a girl that gets raped and murdered and tells the tale of her life and her families life from heaven. A great book!
B000065U1N|3.0|... by a story I was so interested in. I've read a bit of the background to this confrontation. I was very interested in the story, the politics of the region, the failures of American policy makers and military strategists leading to this disaster, and the personal experiences of the men who fought. I even liked some of the actors. <br /> <br />But I couldn't get engaged in this movie. It was really flat, like a clinical description of the combat experience. It was all  terribly realistic, and I'm sure they spent a fortune on effects.   There's very little time for dialog, which I expected, but the bit of dialog they could afford was very poor, and mostly made we wish they'd start shouting \\"RPG!\\" again. <br /> <br />I didn't realize who the directors were until after I'd rented it. I might not have bothered if I'd noticed earlier. <br /> <br />The movie mostly left me wondering about the details of weapons and tactics. The black hawks, frankly, looked like sitting ducks for RPGs. The Humvees also looked weak. In the shower of bullets I didn't understand how they avoided losing all of their gunners, or how they kept rolling. How did those rubber tires survive? <br /> <br />It was hard to piece together the scope of the incident, too. I thought there were around 100 service men trapped in the city overnight, but in the movie you get a sense of there being maybe two dozen. <br /> <br />A few days after seeing this I saw The Godfather for the first time (yeah, yeah, so sue me). During the scene where Mike recovers the pistol in the men's room, my heart was pounding so hard I thought I was going to need medication. It was an interesting contrast because I have no particular interest in gangster movies, the scene had far less weaponry and effects, the story isn't even real, but it was profoundly engaging. I think this reflects on the incompetence of the directors in Black Hawk Down. It's an interesting story which they were unable to tell. <br /> <br />It's worth seeingonce just as a technical portrait of modern warfare.
B00005JKJA|5.0|There is no chapters in this DVD, weirdest thing, besides the freaky movie itself. Hottest scene all time is in this movie. My mind was blown away.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|With production strippped to a minimum, guitar riffs that burn, and Mustaine's snarling (not quite sobre yet) voice, this is Megadeth at their best.  cleaned up, and perked up, and calmed down, the remastered version is even better!
B00005V3Z4|1.0|I am sorry, I love memento, lost in translation, lebowski tannenbaums. What is the deal with this movie. I have tried to watch it 6 or 7 times, and each time I find myself becoming distracted and doing something else. I just don't get it, I respect the opinion of many people who have seen it, and like it, I think they have good taste. Why can't I get it, I find this movie to be so boring I want to gouge my eyes out. I mean maybe because I remember 1988, and I was around the age of the kids in the movie, it doesn't seem so weird to me or something. But I am here to openly admit that I DON'T GET IT...and I get a lot of odd movie. I even think Gylenhall is a good actor, but alas I find this movie revolting
B00028HBKM|5.0|A MUST SEE \\"Movie\\" /STORY . All of us who grew up being taught  that Jesus \\"Died For Me/Us\\" will have a MUCH deeper appreciation and LOVE for HIM after experiencing this film.. <br />Mel Gibson..along with his outstanding cast of actors (Jim Caviezel etc..)indeed had to be divinely inspired... <br />No Doubt, It is THE BEST Religious Epic of All Time..Can't wait To get my DVD edition to see it and get The Inspiration Of Our Lord Again and Again...Rated 5 Stars AT LEAST.... <br />Jeannie
B00003CXMG|4.0|Almost Famous is charming and you can watch it with your older teens.  They'll ask you questions like, were you at Woodstock dad?  Did you do acid and meet mommy in a sleeping bag?  Sure kids, another time, another place, and don't do drugs.     Rock died in the mid 70's, came back in Seattle in early 90's, and died again. Roaming the world in bus and jet like gypsies, that's really cool for a little while. Only groupies and drugs make it bearable for the long haul.     Cameron Crowe had his experience back in 73 and Almost Famous is his belated version.  The actors are okay, the sets look rock-like, but something is not documentary true about those days. I was there and this fake sex and drugs was not fake in 73. In film, the era is sanitized for paying customers, my teens and the nostalgic baby boomers.  Penny Lane is sure nice for a really bad girl.  Read the screenplay and it's as good as the movie.  Hats off to Camereon.
B00007LTIC|5.0|To me I really think Going for the One was the last classic Yes album. It was a welcome return for the band after all five members released solo albums (Steve Howe's Beginnings, Chris Squire's Fish Out of Water, Patrick Moraz's The Story of \\"i\\", Jon Anderson's \\"Olias of Sunhillow\\" and the supposedly not-so-great album from Alan White called Ramshackled). Rick Wakeman rejoined the band after two costly projects (Journey to the Centre of the Earth and The Myths & Legends of King Arthur) nearly bankrupted him. Unfortunately he had to sell off many of his keyboard by then, so not surprisingly his keyboard playing on Going for the One isn't anywhere as elaborate as say, Close to the Edge, and a lot of it seems more like background accompanyment. The Mellotron and Hammond organ all but vanished, but he was still able to use a pipe organ. Also noticibly missing is the Roger Dean artwork, in place is artwork from the design team Hipgnosis (who was responsible for many album covers from Pink Floyd, Genesis, Renaissance, Ashra, the Alan Parsons Project, etc.). But that still did not prevent this from being another great album, and it's nice to see they were able to pull it off in 1977, when punk and disco was on the rise (unfortunately it would not be smooth sailing for this band in the coming years, many reasons because of punk and disco). The title track is a more rocking number. You still get Yes' trademark vocal harmonies. Then you get the laid-back \\"Turn of the Century\\" with more nice vocals from Jon Anderson and acoustic guitar work from Steve Howe. Rick Wakeman sneaks in some keyboards here, but none of the rest of the band was present here, except maybe to provide backing vocals. \\"Parallels\\" was a more rock-oriented piece complete with pipe organ. \\"Wonderous Stories\\" is that trademark Yes sound to the bone. There is no doubt this song would fit well on the radio, then the album closes with the prog epic, \\"Awaken\\". Many call this the album's high point and I have no argument about that. There are plenty of those trademark Yes vocal harmonies, and extended instrumental passages. Rick Wakeman plays a portative pipe-organ here during the more mellow moments. Another great album that is highly recommended to all Yes fans.
B000000WJK|5.0|Simply put, this album is a rock symphony.  I like to listen to classical music occasionally, and I am partial to Rachmaninoff's piano concertos.  There are few albums in the past decade that are truly albums that flow from one song to the next.  This album is an hour of music that can only be described as an emerging kind of genre in and of itself.  I don't think any one song on the album stands by itself.  You have to listen to the whole thing to \\"get it.\\"  (Although I am partial to #9, \\"Butterfly.\\")  You also have to contemplate the album art to understand what they are trying to do.  They've take the theme of what a storm in heaven might be like -- and they've masterfully captured the concept.  The album flows from serenity to chaos and back to serenity; much like a carefully composed classical piece of music.  It's as though you see heaven before a storm, you brave the storm, and then you learn and reflect on it and how you've been changed at the end of the album. <br /> <br />If someone doesn't understand this album, I can empathize with their concerns.  For one, the vocals are really a sidebar to the music.  The voice of the lead singer is really an instrument unto itself that accompanies the rich guitar, bass, horn, and percussion interactions.  Unlike \\"Urban Hyms,\\" the purpose of this album is not to group a bunch of catchy tunes together and sell it to the mainstream.  This album is artsy, and I can see how it's unsuitable for some people who have different tastes.  <br /> <br />I bought this album after listening to the tracks at a music store based on the scan and listen before you buy method.  I was looking for something that beared a resemblance to Radiohead's album, \\"Amnesiac,\\" and \\"A Storm in Heaven,\\" I must say, might actually be better.  It's up there with \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" in my book. <br /> <br />Thus, open your mind, write off an hour on a rainy day to read or just lay back on the couch and listen.  If you just take it in, you might actually figure it out and appreciate it.  This is not something you're going to jam in your car to with your pals.  It's spiritual in a way, and is meant to be listend to alone.  Sure, drugs would help as someone else has said; but I don't think they're necessary to be moved by this rock symphony. <br />
B00007LTIB|5.0|It's no secret Rick Wakeman was disillusioned with Tales From Topographic Oceans. The album was not exactly the darling of rock critics, and even the fans are divided. Prog rock detractors were obviously famous for using that album as to why punk rock happened. Rick Wakeman left, so that left the band in search of a new keyboardist. Vangelis, who was basically then known as a former member of the Greek band Aphrodite's Child (but would quickily became an important figure in electronic music) tried to audition, but didn't get the part, mainly because he wasn't all that keen on Yes' music, but he did end up being friends with Jon Anderson (that's how Anderson appeared on \\"So Long Ago, So Clear\\" on Vangelis' Heaven & Hell album from 1975, and there were those string of Jon & Vangelis albums in the 1980s). Since having Vangelis in Yes didn't work, they found a Swiss-born keyboardist by the name of Patrick Moraz to fill in. He was previously in two previous bands (at least that recorded and released albums), Refugee (with two ex-Nice members, Lee Jackson and Brian Davidson, Emerson couldn't be present thanks to the success of ELP) and the far lesser-known Mainhorse (who released a self-entitled album in 1971 on Polydor). Like Wakeman before him, Moraz used lots of different keyboard. Moraz used a Mini Moog, Mellotrons, an Orchestron (which was a professional-grade version of Mattell's Optigan, which was basically something like a Mellotron that runs on optical discs), Hammond organ, a string synth of some sort, and much more. The resulting album, Relayer, released at the end of 1974 was a much more aggressive, intense and rocking album than their previous offering, probably as a reaction towards that album (Tales from Topographic Oceans tended to be rather soft). There are only three cuts, just like Close to the Edge. The album opens up with the incredible \\"Gates of Delirium\\". The songs goes through many different changes and many exciting passages. There are many passages where the intensity just doesn't stop, especially with Chris Squire's bass and Steve Howe's guitar work. There are lots of strange sound effects provided by Moraz (including the sound of shattering glass, for some reason he enjoys doing, like he did on the Refugee and even Mainhorse album). The closing section (often referred to as \\"Soon\\" even if the album makes no mention of it) really mellows out. \\"Sound Chaser\\" is a real interesting piece, again going through many different changes. Perhaps the least structured song on the whole album, I love how the music goes at a fast pace, then slows down a bit, then picks up again. It's a really unpredictable piece, you don't know what's going to come next. Somewhere Moraz gives us one of his trademark Moog solos. Listening to this, you wonder why he gave us such generic keyboard work when he joined the Moody Blues in the 1980s. \\"To Be Over\\" is the more mellow piece, complete with Steve Howe's sitar guitar. To me, I think this is a nice way to close the album after the rest of the album, which was quite intense and aggressive. Certainly at this point, the rock critics turned their backs on Yes, and not just that, the whole prog rock genre in general (it was unfortunate that just two albums, Tales From Topographic Oceans, and Jethro Tull's A Passion Play that caused such a backlash with the rock critics, and of course those two albums separated the fans from the casual listeners as well, and even the fans were divided over those two albums). Regardless, I always thought Relayer was one of their best albums, and that Roger Dean album cover can't be beat!
0312955006|5.0|I find myself addicted to Connelly and the Harry Bosch novels.  This is the third I have read in a row and 4th overall (I started at the end with the Narrows).  Of the early novels, this is the best.  It is an elegy for LA.  It rings of James Ellroy.  I mean that as a very high compliment.  The novel is again a super mystery, with good twists and turns.  But what makes this so superior is the depth of the characters.  It is rare in this genre to see such depth.  Bravo and on to the Last Coyote.
B00007KWHO|4.0|As everyone knows, Yes' second album, Time & a Word still hadn't established the band yet. Steve Howe was yet to be in the band, and Tony Kaye was to play on one more album before Rick Wakeman came in and really established them as one of the biggest and most important names in prog. It's a bit odd that the American cover (which is totally different from the more controversial UK cover) would show a picture of Steve Howe on the front cover (but then the album was released in the US a few months later after the UK release, by which Howe was a member). But I have to say Time & a Word is not a bad album at all. It's a bit strange to see the band adding an orchestra on some of the cuts during a time when they were still a struggling band. But it actually works quite well. Tony Kaye went for a much more powerful organ sound than he did on their 1969 debut, by adding a fuzz tone, which would serve him well on their next album, The Yes Album as well (but it's a bit strange he went back to the old 1969 organ sound when he teamed up with Peter Banks for their post-Yes band Flash on their 1972 debut). The album opens up with a cover of Ritchie Havens, \\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\\". The first thing you hear is the orchestra and organ. Not having heard the original, I can't compare it to the original, but it still sounds quite Yes. They also cover a Buffalo Springfield song, the Stephen Stills-penned \\"Everydays\\". I have heard the original, and I have to say the Yes version is quite the improvement. More atmospheric and dreamy, with an intense guitar solo from Peter Banks before going back to the way it started. Even if it was Yes covering this song, it's no mistaking the lyrics and a lot of the style is Stills, but with a more progressive bent that only bands like Yes and their prog contemporaries would do. \\"Sweet Dream\\" is a more straightforward number but a wonderful piece, perhaps the song most suited for radio airplay on this album. \\"The Prophet\\" is another favorite of mine. It starts off with the band and orchestra playing an excerpt of Gustav Holst's The Planets before the actual song kicks in. Here, the song has a more '60s feel than what one is used to from Yes, but still a wonderful piece. \\"Clear Days\\" is a nice, short ballad dominated by orchestra, while \\"Astral Traveller\\", often regarded as the album's high point, I tend to have problems with Jon Anderson electronically modifying his voice on this song, and it's with the instrumental section the song really takes off. The closing title track is a bit more folk-y, almost sing-along quality. To me Time & a Word is a truly worthwhile album, but since the band was still trying to get their sound developed, you are of course better off starting with their next three albums (The Yes Album, Fragile, and Close to the Edge) before coming here. Still a nice, historical album to have in your collection.
B00009V7T2|4.0|Man, everybody sweats this album like it's the greatest thing ever. Now, don't get me wrong, it's a good album, but there's way too much pretentiousness here to be giving it five stars. A perfect example is Eriatarka. I'm not sure if that's the song I'm thinking of because all the song titles are ridiculous, but anyway, it's the one that's like 13 minutes long or something. This song roars in out of nowhere and the first time I heard it, I thought it was going to be my new favorite jam. That was after the first four minutes. Then for some reason, instead of making it a fantastic five or six minute song that would have gone down in rock history, they decided to drag it out over 13 minutes, to the point where THE MUSIC COMPLETELY STOPS. It's little unnecessary tricks like this that prevents a good album from being a great one. <br />That said, there are many good moments and when I bought Deloused in the Whatever, I listened to it very often for a few weeks. I did see the band live though, and it was by far one of the worst shows I have ever seen in my life. It really was horrid and the only highlight was meeting two drunken dudes with Pantera tattoos who wanted to knock out the lead singer. <br />Mars Volta has a lot of potential, I hope on their next album they lose the artsy BS and just make some good music.  <br />Also, At The Drive In's final album was better than this one.
B00005JN2F|4.0|I must admit that, as a fan of Robert Ludlum (namely his 'Bourne' series), when I heard that the books would be coming to screen I was a little skeptical. That's sort of a defense mechanism for an avid reader seeing a great book made into a film . If it disappoints, it's not a big deal. If the movie is good, it's a pleasant surprise and highly enjoyable. Not only was I pleased with \\"THE BOURNE IDENTITY\\", I was impressed!<br /><br />That brings us to THE BOURNE SUPREMACY. A lot of people, for whatever reason, who read the Bourne series considered 'Supremacy' a letdown, and wondered if the same would happen in the film series. It did not. Full of action, and yet full of suspense, 'Supremacy' is right along the same lines of 'Identity' and makes the fans of the series eager to see the third and presumably final installment, \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\", which it is assumed will be made.<br /><br />Matt Damon does a fantastic job as Jason Bourne and the ever cute Franka Potente reprises her role as Marie. If you get the chance, get to a theater. You won't be disappointed.
B00000DCHI|5.0|The New York born Billy Joel is one of the most talented singer-songwriters to come out in history. Never a critics favorite, Joel has always been a radio staple, making his way to FM classic rock stations, album rock stations, top 40 stations, and unfortunately adult contemporary hell, which is where he is spinning today. The former boxer uses articulate storytelling with Tin Pan Alley characteristics to make his music popular, and it has been for over 30 years. <br /> <br />Greatest Hits Volumes 1-2 focuses on Joels hitmaking period: 1973-1985. The album opens up with the biographically \\"Piano Man\\", the ideal choice to open up with. The first disc spans 1973 to 1977, while the second disc features 1978 to 1985. The discs feature hard rock (\\"Captain Jack\\", \\"Big Shot\\", \\"You May be Right\\", etc.), storytelling (\\"My Life\\", \\"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\\"), new wave (\\"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\\"), doo-wop (\\"Uptown Girl\\", \\"The Longest Time) and romantic piano ballads (\\"Just The Way you Are\\", \\"Shes Got a Way\\", \\"Shes Always a Women). Most of his hit singles and popular album tracks are included. Also included are two new songs \\"You're Only Human\\" and \\"The Night is Still Young\\", which are also hits in themselves. <br /> <br />Two things that detract from this collection. One, some earlier hit tracks are MIA (\\"Honesty\\", \\"Sometimes a Fantasy\\", \\"Miami 2017\\".) Two, \\"An Innocent Man\\", his 1983 release, is partially represented, but also missing some key tracks as well (\\"Keeping the Faith\\", \\"Leave a Tender Moment Alone\\", and the title track.) Two of these are included later in Greatest Hits 3, but they should have all been together to make it more cohesive. However, there are enough key songs and good listening music to make these two points forgiveable. <br /> <br />If you want to listen to one of the greatest sing-songwriters at his peak, or if you just want to listen to some of the finest crafted music in history, this is the CD to pick up. It's one of the few CD's, along with Michael Jacksons \\"Thriller\\" and Bruce Springsteens \\"Born in the USA\\" that I can listen to from beginning to end. Joel might not be releasing anymore new music as he has shifted his focus to classical music and compositions, but he still tours, and is one of the best concerts to go see. This edition also includes the studio version of \\"New York State of Mind\\" and the longer unedited album versions of \\"The Stranger\\", \\"Pressure\\", \\"Just the Way You Are\\", and \\"My Life\\".

B000001ED1|4.0|\\"Relish\\" contains Joan Osborne's world-wide smash hit \\"One of Us\\". I think this song alone is so great that it's worth the whole CD.<br /><br />This doesn't mean that it's the only strong track on the album; on the contrary. Joan Osborne has a powerful voice and sings the songs convincingly and with great variety. It's a CD with lots of atmosphere.<br /><br />But don't expect much of the same kind as \\"One of Us\\"; which is actually the only track which could be called \\"mainstream\\"<br /><br />Many other different styles can be found. Some strong blues/blues-influenced songs like \\"Help Me\\" and \\"Man in a Long Black Coat\\".<br /><br />An almost folkish tune; the great \\"St Teresa\\" - one of the real oustanding tracks.<br /><br />Ballads like \\"Crazy Baby\\" and \\"Lumina\\".<br /><br />Wild Velvet Underground rock on \\"Right Hand Man\\".<br /><br />A slow Sheryl Crow-type rocker like \\"Let's Just Get Naked\\"<br /><br />My favourites besides \\"One of Us\\" and \\"St Teresa\\" are \\"Man in a Long Black Coat\\" ( written by Bob Dylan ) and \\"Let's Just Get Naked\\"
B0000021RG|4.0|This was the second Chicago album I ever heard... right after Chicago 17. Talk about culture shock! I first thought \\"how full of themselves can they be? Four albums?\\" Then, given the fact they sold out a week at Carnegie Hall and being the first rock band to do so then I understand. The packaging for the album was fantastic: a full booklet complete with all concert listings from '67-'71 and three posters. As far as the music, the venue has more to do with it than anything. Carnegie Hall isn't friendly to electronic amplification. The engineering is not quite up to par. On the first night, Peter Cetera stated the recording crew were still tooling with their amplifiers during the first night's concert. Shouldn't that have been done ahead of time?? \\"In The Country\\" sounds great, as does \\"South California Purples\\", \\"Introduction\\", \\"I Don't Want Your Money\\", and \\"I'm A Man\\". \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" does sound a bit slow. Kath sounds like he's just going through the motions on vocals on \\"Make Me Smile\\". His guitar work is great as usual. The stereo mix on the vocals is intriguing. The dialogue between songs is genuine; especially the part where a audience member requests \\"Make Me Smile\\" - Lamm says, \\"Keep sitting there man\\".  <br />I believe the vinyl records sound better than the CDs. For an album of this magnitude, they should at least remaster it somehow and improve the sound a bit. There should be lots of master tapes for a week's worth of recording.  <br />If you can get your hands on it, LIVE IN JAPAN is a better sounding album. Recorded at Osaka in '72, the double disc is not as good as \\"Carnegie Hall\\". Sony recorded the shows using 2 eight track machines, giving producer James Williams Guercio 16 tracks to work with. The sound is great but the playing is not as tight as it was in New York. <br />If you like live recordings, this is an interesting find. While not the greatest live album of the seventies (I believe that distinction goes to Neil Diamond's HOT AUGUST NIGHT), it is the best of Chicago's three live album releases.
B000021XS0|5.0|Judging from all the reviews so far, either you like long rambling prog or you don't. This album is a stage between the short melodic songs from Images and Words and the long heavy songs from Train of Thought. If you only like one or the other, chances are you won't like this. But if you enjoy long, melodic, proggy songs, then this album will be your savior.
B00005JL9B|5.0|BR had me riveted from the first opening shots of a blood stained smiling girl right up to the end.  Movies like this, for me, only come around once in 5+ years.      While the premise of BR is weak (how in the world does randomly choosing kids to kill each other scare other kids straight?  Choosing messed up kids to kill each other off yes, but randomly?) there is so much of everything else done right that it's very easily overlooked.    There are some cheesy / overdramatic moments in the movie.  However, the concept of the BR and what happens to ordinary teens in this extraordinary situation is done brilliantly.  Ordinarily harmless teen cliques / social annoyances, now become magnified to the point of life and death.  What happens to friends when their choices are kill or be killed?  What happens when the social contract is null and void?    Spoiler Alert!!!! -------------            One of the most dramatic moments include the scene when a student's collar-bomb is triggered by the teacher Kitano.  There is no compassion from his classmates just a mad scramble to keep away.  Even his best friend pushes him away helplessly.  But after that mad scramble we see humanity still there but pushed down helplessly by terrible circumstances.  And my favorite moment: Shogo Kawada and his girlfiend are the only ones left alive with the BR running out of time.  As they try to rest, the collar bombs starts to count down since there are still 2 contestants alive.  They look at each other and hug.  What follows next just blew my mind away as did many of the movie's very memorable moments.     The \\"Rules\\" of BR are well thought out as is the choices of \\"Weapons\\" given to the teens.  Not all the kids are armed to the teeth.  Some get useless items or useful items but not as direct weapons.    The music is enjoyable and very memorable but I hated the ending pop song which seemed all wrong and disjointed with the rest of  the film.  I would be surprised if it was chosen by Kinji sanas opposed to a marketing vehicle.  BTW i believe it is also used as the theme song for a japanese curry (vermont?).      While I was geniuninely interested in what happened to the students I did not find much of the violence particularly disturbing or emotional.  For that I refer you to any Quentin flick where torture is involved or City of God where Ze meets up with the Shorty gang.  I find violence disturbing when it involves a defenseless victim.  That only happens once or twice in this movie.  It's not so much the violence that is shocking as it is the circumstances surrounding that violence like the collar bomb and Kawada and his girlfirend.  This is certainly no, \\"yawn... another person died\\" in movies like Van Helsing or unfortunately BR2, the sequel to this film.    However much you may enjoy BR, be warned about BR2 which is a load of crap.  Seriously.    And as a postscript you gotta take some of these 1 stars with a grain of salt because the same people who gave BR 1 star gave Van Helsing (piece of sheet) AND I, Robot 4 stars!!  Actually, I'm kinda glad that is the case.  If the same people who gave those works or crap 4 Stars had given 4 or 5 stars to BR I'd be embarassed.
B000001ESP|5.0|It's a testament to the talent of this trio that one of their most accomplished releases musically and lyrically is _also_ one of their most accessible.<br /><br />Lots of times, when musicians' musicians get together to record an album of 'prog rock', the results are interesting to their fellow musicians but leave the average listener in the dust.<br /><br />The three members of Rush (Geddy Lee, vocals and bass; Alex Lifeson, guitars; Neil Peart, percussion and lyrics) don't work that way. They _are_ musicians' musicians (and they don't achieve their appeal by dumbing anything down), but they never retreat into technodazzle and flashy obscurantism; their music is just (or almost) as intelligible and enjoyable to a listener who wouldn't know 7/4 time if it bit him on the behind. (Even Geddy Lee's solo release _My Favorite Headache_, which you might expect to be filled with all sorts of at-last-a-chance-to-show-off bass theatrics, is on the contrary a fine collection of really good _songs_.)<br /><br />Likewise, Peart's lyrics are intelligent and thoughtful, but they never talk down to us listeners or hide from us in a private, hipper-than-thou symbolic language. They're well-lit, with the clarity of sharp lights and shadows -- 'deep' without being hard to follow.<br /><br />_Moving Pictures_ gets my vote as the CD to start with if you want to introduce yourself to this great band. Mind you, that's not because I share the common opinion that they jumped the shark in the mid-1980s; I may be alone in the world in thinking that these guys have never released a bad album, but that is in fact what I think.<br /><br />No, the reason I name this album as the place to begin is that its quality is stratospheric even for Rush. This stuff is, lyrically, some of Peart's tightest writing, and the music (mostly by Lee and Lifeson with occasional contributions from Peart) is from start to finish as streamlined and clean-cut as a rocket.<br /><br />Everybody has heard 'Tom Sawyer' and 'Limelight', so I won't comment on those. As for the rest: the futuristic road-warrior SF of 'Red Barchetta' is like a miniature _2112_; the magisterial and menacing 'Witch Hunt' is every bit as timely today as it was in 1981; 'YYZ' (the airport designation for Toronto -- tap it out in Morse code) is one of their finest instrumentals (and their last until a decade later); 'The Camera Eye' manages to turn two short 'snapshot' verses (about New York and London) into a sprawling eleven-minute epic that doesn't feel anywhere near that long; and the Police _wish_ they could have written and recorded the impossibly infectious 'Vital Signs'. The music is brilliant throughout, and Peart's incisive lyrics carry on his healthy celebration of individualism, liberty, and self-reliance without burying us in Ayn Rand references.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you're going to like Rush, you'll like this CD, and if not, not. Oh, you could do almost as well by starting with _Permanent Waves_. But most of their catalogue has _something_ on it that a Rush newbie might not appreciate (even _2112_).<br /><br />This one is a gem, released when these guys had just broken through to the mainstream and were absolutely at the top of their game. If you have even a casual interest in Rush, don't miss it.om Sawyer' and 'Limelight', so I won't comment on those.

B0000028UK|5.0|Another album, another 5 star rating. I hate to throw these out so casually, but I've happened to review a lot of classic albums recently. On their second album \\"Vs.\\", Pearl Jam tones down the glossy, stadium-rock worthy production that was all over \\"Ten\\". The result is a set of songs that really capture the raw energy of the band. There's nothing as powerfully anthematic as \\"Alive\\" or \\"Even Flow\\", but the songs are stronger overall. <br /> <br />\\"Go\\" and \\"Animal\\" kick off the album with a one-two punch of raw, punk-like intensity. Both of them combine killer guitar riffs, angry/angst-ridden lyrics, and catchy hooks. The popular radio hit \\"Dissident\\" has more of a laid back rockin' feel, akin to classic rock as opposed to punk. <br /> <br />One of my favorites on the album is \\"W.M.A\\", a menacing rant on racial injustice whose tribal drums and thick bass lines create a very omnious tone throughout. Speaking of thick bass lines, the metaphorical \\"Rats\\" is as funky as you'll get in a Pearl Jam song. <br /> <br />A couple of the softer moments on the album turned out to be the most popular songs on here: The mid-tempo accoustic rock of \\"Daughter\\" and the introspective folk ballad, \\"Eldery Woman Behind The Counter in a Small Town\\".  <br /> <br />Arguably the best Pearl Jam song ever, \\"Rearviewmirror\\" is a fast paced rocker with a distinct 'epic' feel to it. Eddie Vedder's reflective lyrics drive the song along, amidst powerful guitars and thunderous drums. The song builds and builds up to an emotional climax as Eddie sings, \\"Saw things so much clearer..once you were in my rearview mirror..\\". Between the lyrics and the rhythm, it's also one of the best driving songs. <br /> <br />The album closes with the melancholy \\"Indifference\\", whose minimalistic arrangement sculpt one of Pearl Jam's most haunting, mysterious songs. <br /> <br />Other great songs include the visceral \\"Blood\\" (probably the heaviest, most furious Pearl Jam song ever), the angry-but-catchy rock of \\"Leash\\", and the sarcastic pop/rock of \\"Glorified G\\".  <br /> <br />Top to bottom, \\"Vs.\\" ranks up there with \\"No Code\\" and \\"Riot Act\\" as one of the most solid Pearl Jam albums there is. Upon its release in the fall of 93, \\"Vs.\\" managed to break sales records, a testiment to the band's popularity at the time. For better or worse, each subsequent album sold less and less, as the band refused to make music videos or do any sorts of mainstream promotion.  <br /> <br />Best Songs: Rearviewmirror, W.M.A., Indifference, Leash.
B0000630YA|5.0|I can remember blasting this tune out of my klipsh speakers at full volume, seemingly rocking out the whole neighborhood {97 db at 1 watt}.  Hunter and Wagner are superb on guitar strait from Lou Reed's \\"Berlin\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Animal\\".  Escape, Cold Ethyl, Dept. of Youth, what classics.  No need to go on forever about this album just buy it and find out for yourself.  A must buy.
B000006OBQ|5.0|Sinatra owned Vegas, in every way. This album is no longer just a great record, his best live album, but a historic document of a time gone by. This type of world class entretainment is gone, and artists like Frank will no longer appear among us. We are stuck now with 'american idols'. Imagine spending a fortune, to go to Vegas, dressing up, going to a fancy club, have a good steak, spend to much for a drink and get entretained by Mr Count Basie. And then the big guy, larger than life, Sinatra, appearing on stage, to ENTRETAIN YOU. Yes, even with jokes if its neccesary. Even politically incorrect jokes. Sinatra was and remains the champion, the chairman of the board. Nobody can touch him.
B000000H3Z|5.0|When I was a teenager, there was a holy (well, unholy) trinity of thrash/death metal albums: Slayer's 'Reign in Blood' (thrash), Sepultura's 'Beneath the Remains' (borderline death) and Morbid Angel's 'Altars of Madness' (death).  Just unbelievably intense music. <br /> <br />This is Sepultura's masterpiece, although 'Arise' isn't far behind it - much in the same way that 'Seasons in the Abyss' isn't far behind 'Reign in Blood'.  Most albums have fillers, but not this one.  Every song is strong and has its own distinctive voice, but my favourites are 'Sarcastic Existence', 'Slaves of Pain' and 'Hungry'.  The guitar sound is truly unique at times, whilst the drumming is sensational. <br /> <br />I will NEVER tire of this classic.
B0000AKY7R|4.0|Basically, a guitar tribute to John Coltrane. Inspired by the spiritual side of Trane. These two are some of the most inventive guitar players of their generation. The remastered job is also great, you can hear the great Larry Young contribution now. I do feel this album is a little dated, a piece of its time that has not aged all that well, but time has also helped to put it in his right place. This was definitely not the flop that the Santana fans denounced way bakc then.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code is an incredible fiction, intertwined with actual history and religion.<br /><br />I am not a religious person, never have been, and nothing has done more in my lifetime than this novel, to interest me in learning more about the Bible. Having completed The Da Vinci Code (a super quick read, this one is difficult to put down), I found myself investigating parts of the novel in reference books, and online to forge my own opinion on religious background.<br /><br />People who know me, are amazed to see this, and I have quickly spread the word about the greatness of this novel so that they can see for themselves. Friends and family have returned from reading it themselves, with a keener interest in finding out more about the origin of the bible too. The word of The Da Vinci Code is spreading!<br /><br />I found Brown's references to art and history absolutely incredible and so well researched. I can no longer skip past the art section in the local public library without skimming through Da Vinci's artwork to view 'The Last Supper' in appreciation of Brown's perception to key details.<br /><br />Some people have commented in their reviews about Brown being preachy in parts, and talking as if in a lecture. In my opinion these parts are vital to the success of the book, as they provide the reader with an important understanding which is a necessity for such a complex theme. I for one appreaciated this information with no prior background in religion.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is without a doubt in my mind the single most profound novel I have ever read. I already have, and I will continue to promote it to those who have not yet discovered Brown's fascinating work.
0679879269|3.0|I;ve read the reviews. I've heard people rave about these books. I read them because they were highly recommended to me.  <br /> <br />But I must have missed something, because I can't say I enjoyed them. Well, I can't say I enjoyed this last one. By the end of the book, it left me in a blue funk. And I don't mean over the seperation or anything like that. I guess you could say it was the point, the underlying premise that put me there.
B00006G8HX|5.0|WRITER: Harve Bennett. DIRECTOR: Leonard Nimoy.<br />THEATRICAL RELEASE: June 1, 1984.<br />BUDGET ESTIMATE: $17 million.<br />USA BOX OFFICE: $76 million. WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE: $87 million.<br /><br />THE PLOT: Kirk and Co. disobey Federation orders by stealing the Enterprise from space dock (!!) and heading for the forbidden Genesis Planet (created in the previous film) to retrieve Spock's body and clash with Commander Kruge, a Klingon bent on claiming the secrets of the Genesis Project for his own destructive purposes.<br /><br />COMMENT: For a 1984 film I admit that the Genesis Planet sets aren't the greatest, but they get the job done. Besides, if you're used to watching the TV episodes they're fantastic. Star Trek was never about outstanding special effects anyway (with the exception of the unique and brilliant \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\"); no, Star Trek is about people, their joy of living and their grand spirit of adventure and exploration.<br /><br />GREAT LINE: Witnessing the emblazed ship go down on the apocalyptic horizon of the Genesis Plane, Kirk asks: \\"My God, Bones, what have I done?\\" McCoy responds: \\"What you HAD to do, Jim, what you ALWAYS do -- turn death into a fighting chance to live.\\"<br /><br />QUESTION: Just how far does the Saavik (Robin Curtis) go in helping the teenage Spock get through his first Vulcan \\"pon farr\\" on the Genesis Planet? The film itself doesn't concretely answer, it simply shows Saavik holding Spock's hand and comforting him. However, since early drafts of \\"Star Trek IV\\" featured Saavik remaining on Vulcan because she was pregnant with Spock's child, we can assume that Saavik went ALL THE WAY in helping young Spock (!). Okay, so now the question is: Did she do this out of a sense of Vulcan duty or simply to get her jollies with a young Vulcan stud?<br /><br />Speaking of Robin Curtis, she plays Saavik much more Vulcan-like (i.e. better) than Kirstie Alley in \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" (I never bought Alley as a Vulcan). In truth, Curtis in nothing less than exceptional in this film.<br /><br />COMMENT: Although early in the story Sarek describes Spock's 'katra' as his \\"living spirit\\" and later Kirk refers to it as his \\"soul,\\" it's clear in the the film that the katra does not refer to spirit or soul in the traditional sense, i.e. one's non-physical life-essence. We know this because, while McCoy possesses Spock's katra, the Vulan's actual consciousness or life-essence is simultaneously within his rapidly-aging regenerating body on the Genesis Planet. Hence, the katra could be accurately described as an incorporeal file of a Vulcan's knowledge and life, which is why Sarek described it as \\"everything (Spock) knew, everything he was.\\"<br /><br />FYI: I never bought Merritt Butrick as Kirk's son, David, but he's serviceable. He died of AIDS in 1989 at the young age of 29.<br /><br />ANALYSIS: \\"The Search for Spock\\" is a great Star Trek picture embellished by the welcome return of Trek's quirky brand of humor. The story expertly meshes comedic touches with dead-serious tragedy. It's also thoroughly enjoyable and compelling to see Kirk & crew in the wry and unexpected role of Starfleet rebels, risking everything to honor their fallen comrade. Another highlight is the return of Klingons as major villains, with upgraded make-up no less.<br /><br />The only problem with this Trek installment is revealed in the title -- there's no Spock, at least as we know him, but the film does a fabulous job of instilling a sense of the Vulcan's lingering presence. The story climaxes with the powerful image of Spock's mates warmly gathering together. This scene is worth the wait where a simple raised eyebrow fills the viewer with incredible warmth and joy (not to mention the shedding of a few tears).<br /><br />Also, I gotta hand it to the creators for coming up with an inspired and (seemingly) credible way of resurrecting Spock; the Genesis Project was, by happenstance, the perfect catalyst.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: \\"Star Trek III\\" is inexplicably condemned by fundamentalist trekkers as a failure or, at best, mediocre.<br /><br />They're wrong.They're wrong.
B000002ACR|5.0|younger than yesterday is one of the high marks of popular music - when rock, country, folk, jazz, raga etc all weaved into one seamless and tasteful whole - a little like sgnt peppers by the beatles. <br /> <br />and like the beatles at the same time, the byrds were all over the place personally and musically. crosby's following of music as varied as jazz and raga and the mamas and the papas shows - in the exquisite and moody ballad everybody's been burned, in the sumptuously droned Mind gardens and in one of the best songs of the 60s, which was cruelly left off the album - the Mamas and the Papas influenced Lady Friend. <br /> <br />a very sepcial album and one that shows off the best of the byrds - if you buy two byrds albums get this and The Notorious... If you buy three or four add Mr Tambourine Man and Sweetheart of the Rodeo. The cd is also better value for the excellent bonus tracks including the etheral It happens each day - though the record has a better sound.
B000083C49|5.0|THE STORY: Kirk and crew must go back in time to late 20th century San Francisco and bring back a couple of humpback whales to save 23rd century Earth from a strange alien space probe that is attempting to commune with whales, but can't because they've become extinct (!!).<br /><br />The movie's title, \\"The Voyage Home,\\" is appropriate not only in terms of the film's plot, but also represents the revival of the fun character interplay and spirit of adventure that have endeared the original cast to ever-growing legions of loyal fans (although, admittedly, we enjoyed a nice little dosage of this in the previous film in the series). Shatner referred to this quality as the joy of living. This joyful energy that the characters possess would at times verge on tongue-in-cheek but would never cross the line and the best Star Trek hours include this texture. He pointed out that there's a fine line that the actors and writers have to walk in order to maintain a sense of reality and keep from devolving into camp. They did a fine job of walking this line in The Voyage Home; some of the dialogue and situations are so absolutely absurd that the film is somewhat of a comedy, but the pic strangely maintains a sense of reality throughout, avoiding the rut of camp. (The next film in the series wouldn't be as successful in this regard).<br /><br />One amusing recurring theme is the characters' attempts to add profanities to their every-day speech in order to fit into present-day America. Their efforts are noble but it goes without saying that they fail abysmally, especially Spock. Kirk's first attempt is in response to a cab driver who calls him a \\"Dumbass!\\" for walking in front of his cab. Kirk responds by giving a quick uncertain glance at his comrades and then spouting, \\"Well, a double 'dumbass' on you!\\"<br /><br />The cast members have unanimously expressed that The Voyage Home was the best Star Trek feature film, or at least one of the best. Nichelle Nichols felt the first movie was certainly good science fiction but it wasn't a faithful adaption of the television Star Trek (i.e. it lacked the action, humor and character interplay), the second film was centered around Spock dying and the third around bringing him back to life. She pointed out how there was never enough time to introduce the qualities that made Star Tek on TV so great. She believed these qualities successful came to the fore with The Voyage Home.<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: Everything magically comes together on this fourth film outing to give us a tale every bit as good as the best TV episodes. In fact, it's BETTER because it's a feature film and looks so good (unlike the cheap sets of the original three-year TV run). I gotta hand it to Leonard Nimoy for coming up with such an intriguingly bizarre and original tale involving humpback whales that communicate with aliens. If I didn't know better I'd think he was influenced by some trippy foreign substance. Needless to say, the film's great fun and grand entertainment of the highest order -- even if you're not a Trek fan. In other words, this is the most accessible of the feature films for non-Trekkers.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Without a doubt, the best of the film series -- the most entertaining, the most popular and the most profitable.ction but it wasn't a faithful adaption of the television Star Trek (i.e. it lacked the action, humor and character interplay), the second film was centered around Spock dying and the third around bringing him back to life.

B000002J6F|5.0|stephen stills has never made a better album. this is a stirring evocation of his soul, his emotions, his unrequited love for rita coolidge (the dark-haired raven) and his scorn for the rock lifestyle. <br /> <br />so begins the task is one of the most moving songs ever recorded. the pedal steel lures you in and lets you down like a lovesick wave. move around, johnny's garden, how far, both of us (bound to lose), colorado - the heart of this album is full of emotional (and you can hear it in his voice) ballads and folky tunes with various accompaniements.  in retrospect it is as if he was having a breakdown.  eleswhere we see 'love gangster' allegedly about graham nash and his  'taking' of rita coolidge from Stephen and the bitterness of right now.  brilliant slide guitar thoughout and singing. the band is fautless and yes, you can believe very easily that bill wyman would have left the stones for manassas. the second album is also very good actually - if you like this one. it does exactly the same but on one album.   <br /> <br />i wish there was another manassas out there or at least that they has recorded a few more albums. i guess this will have to do for now. <br /> <br />oh well, thanks anyway Stephen

If you're a parent with a sence of humor, and have a child who is developing one, this book is a must have.  When you read it, let your hair down and have a good time, the book will be a blast to read for adult and child.
0345451325|3.0|This book is only good for one thing and that is giving a ROUGH overview of what happened before the game of Halo. It is not an indepth read. The characters are not fully developed for the most part. The plot is definitely there but the author decided not to fill in the parts between the major points of plot with anything to really make the characters more human. Masterchief is John-117. No last name. No family history. And you get no sense of any family from any of the characters. When I step back away from the book I wonder \\"why are they fighting?\\". They rarely go into anything that would prove they're fighting and protecting something that means more to them than their lives. <br /> <br />Overall this is a book that you read if you want a quick, easy read that won't tax your brain.
0754023818|4.0|As an Australian I am always interested in how others see our country. Mr Bryson notes that in 1996 from evidence in articles in the New York Times Australia was referred to about the same number of times as countries with a GDP about the size of New Jersey, which is to say not much at all.  But he does concede that in terms of sporting success Australia per head of population Australia leads the world.  For the first days of the 2004 Olympics it was China one, Australia two.  Canada, perhaps a comparable country, but greater population, was in the twenties.  We are also boring with Australia's dullest man as our Prime Minister.  Mr Bryson covers all the usual suspects - sharks, snakes, crocodiles, insects, sea stinging creatures, rabbits, weird politicians such as Pauline Hanson, Jim Cairns and Jo Jhelke Peterson.  But he does his homework, writes well, and does not condescend or patronize. I learned that I was born a British subject as Australian Citizenship did not exist until 1949, I learn that Aboriginal people were butchered and used as dog meat, that Myall Creek is famous not because Aboriginal people were slaughtered there but because six whites were hung for those deeds. But Mr Bryson also spends some time outlining unparalleled achievement of Aboriginal people being able to connect still with their cultural origins 40,000 years ago.  I understood too that the ten year drought of 1890 was made much worse by the millions of rabbits (originally imported from Britain in 1850 for shooting fun) which had by that time devastated the land in combination with overgrazing by millions of sheep. Maybe the land has not yet recovered.<br /><br />I hope Australians read this book.  Lots of them.
B00006D295|5.0|there has been alot of cult classics, but this one started the one and only line of the \\"dont dream it be it\\" fallowers. I love this movie on many personal levels, and can't really say anything that has already been said about this great classic. Just to sit back, and watch the next generation adapt.
B0002DB52M|5.0|The thing about Dogville is that it caused a stir before it even made it to the theaters, continued to do so after it hit the screens and it seems like this wont stop for a long-long time either. Critics found a miraculous way to label it \\"anti-american\\" (funniest thing I've heard about a film in ages) whereas Dogville is about a town anywhere on the globe. Others suggested that it's a pointlessly bleak film when anyone with a functioning brain should easily recognise how ultra-realistic this film actually is..And on and on... <br /> <br />    But this is how humans are. Once we have to be confronted with the not-so great side of our nature we tend to be evasive. We tend to invent excuses. Lie if we have to. And our not-so great nature turns even uglier. There's no limit to our ugliness just as there could be no limit to our goodness if we somehow found a way to be honest about what we are.  <br /> <br />   But Dogville's premise, no matter how you cut it, is undeniable: humans when given power over someone will more than likely exploit him, beat him, humiliate him, dehumanise him. And that's the good scenario. Power corrupts and it corrupts totally. <br /> <br />    As a seemingly hunted woman arrives at a remote and isolated town, the powers of the human psyche go into full effect. The town goes into council and decides to take this woman under its wings recognising -albeit not admitting it- that there is much to be gained here. Everybody has a small little agenda to run. That agenda can take all kinds of different colours: it might a sexual one, it might be a workwise exploitative one, or it might be a \\"well, lets see what good this can be for me\\" one. All of the agendas together are in their essence perverse and malevolent. <br /> <br />   As the story progresses things turn uglier. And uglier. The director and scriptwriter relentlessly follow the lead they've set up. The fate of the \\"protected\\" woman becomes darker and darker right infront of your eyeswhether this might mean rape, utter degradation, daily devaluation of dignity, or whatever else you could think of that would drive the less endurable from us to suicide under such circumstances. <br /> <br />   But the female-protagonist of the story hangs on. And it's a mystery really for the audience why she does, especially as the films stretches for 3 hours while it seems that the longer she allows herself to stay into this environment of sick intentions she might not even come through it alive. The more suspicious of the audience might sense that she has an agenda as well. If so, it's one you wont suspect, until the end of the film thrusts forward and hits you with a vengeance no other film could claim. <br /> <br />    And long after you've taken your eyes off the screen, Dogville will keep lingering annoyingly in your mind. Is this what we are? And do we deserve what Dogville shows as a resolution to its story? The answer is not comfortable. <br /> <br />     Dogville is simply an unparallel masterpiece. On any level a film could judged. The acting is absolutely stunning and this not only from Nicole Kidman who gives the performance of a lifetime but from everyone else in the cast, even the characters who speak a mere few lines. I cant think of another film where there's such an overwhelming series of great performances from such a diverse and quite big cast. <br /> <br />    This still takes second seat though to the strikingly effective directing of Lars von Triers. It's a stroke of genius really. He didn't need a huge budget to make Dogville what it is, because he only needed the actors. Literally. The walls are missing from Dogville. The set is basically a design on the floor, made so that everything could be stripped bare of any element hiding it. So it's allegorigal and straightforward simoultaneously. The effect of this is gripping. <br /> <br />    Easily one of the most intelligent, cynical, human and brutal films ever made, Dogville has gained a place way high in the pantheon of great movies. Its reputation is only destined to grow once the last superficial critiques fade away as well. It's destined to be recognised for its message and for the incredible work for art that it is.  <br /> <br />    As far as films about the human condition go, this is the film to end all films. <br /> <br />    <br /> <br />
B0001EBXBK|1.0|I'm an indipendent film maker turned Hollywood. Not that I was any good in my days as a indipendent film maker. A long time ago I learned a neat little trick to fool dumb film audiences into thinking I actually have a speck of talent. It's very simple you see. All you have to do is take bits and peices of stories from films you love, mix it all up in a screenplay, and pass it off as your own origional idea's. Make sure to also add catchy dialogue about fast food chains, plenty of violence, and lots of drug refrences and abuse. Stupid audiences with attention defecit disorder like that kinda stuff. It keeps their simple minds entertained. Negativity is much more appealing and is less of a challenge to portray. I almost forgot, don't forget to cut your movie in half so this way you can make double the money. <br />I am the greatest director of all time. The five movies I have made in my career will be embraced by morons like you till the end of time as we know it. <br />I would like to thank you morons for making a moron like me uber-rich. <br />Thanks <BR>Quentin Terrantino.
B000002AP1|1.0|Iggy (or whoever really remixed Raw Power) apparently didn't realize that the filmmakers of Spinal Tap were joking about turning up the amps to 11. All these vandals accomplished was to wipe out a good portion of the signal and make this cd unlistenable at normal volumes. As others have stated, Iggy and the Stooges were the proto-punk of their day. Way to trash a historical document, guys.
B0002IU988|5.0|this is one of the best cds ive heard in a long time.  i dont see why theres so many bad reviews, yes there are a few songs however that do sound like creed but i hear alot of soundgarden in this band. i also hear some van halen to, but not a lot but not a lot of creed.  the 2 songs that sound like creed are \\"open your eyes\\" and \\"burn it down\\".  \\"open your eyes\\" sounds like a new \\"my sacrifice\\" with a kick ass solo in it to top it off.  so if u like audioslave or velvet revolver you'll most likely like alter bridge
B000000OAN|5.0|One of Queens biggest albums,  Topping the charts with \\"Bohemian Rapsody\\" and \\"Your my best Friend\\" <br />One of Queen most controversial songs \\"Death on two legs\\" The song is dedicated to Jack Nelson, one of Queen's first managers when they had a deal with Trident records. Nelson according to Freddie Mercury, stole mnst of Queens money, and then fleed to the U.S. leaving the band with a lot of debts. On the \\"Live Killers Album\\" you can hear Freddie saying; -\\"This song is dedicated to a motherf@cker of a gentleman\\". ~A great way to start the album! This song is not about Vampires and is not even close to Gothic Rock... Glam Rock yes, Gothic no,  Smashing pumkins: \\"Gothic\\",    Queen: \\"Glamer Rock...\\" <br />  <br />Good company features 'May' as the lead vocals and he does a great job.  As well his guitar work is unmatched.  McCartneyesque with a folk twist?   <br />I'm in love with my car  Featuring the Vocals of Taylor.. outstanding! <br /> <br />Seems to be that this album unlike the three before it featured everyone in the Band and brings to light the vocal power of each individual within the group.  This could be another reason to call this album \\"A night at the opera.\\" Also this album Set a precedent that all the later albums seem to be compared too. <br /> <br />all in all this is a powerful and well orchestrated and produced album. If you have listend to Queen and do no own this album buy it. If you have never listend to Queen but you are thinking about it Get this Album first to cut you teeth on.. Then move on to any of the others.   <br /> <br /> <br />
0440238609|1.0|I am a children's librarian, and I have to speak my mind.  So many parents allow their children to check these books out, and then when they talk to the child about the book, they are outraged and come storming into the library.  I don't blame them actually.  We stock many books because of public access and free speech.  If you are trying to protect your child because of religion or childhood innocence, you really need to read reviews of children's books before you allow them to read those books.  Many books these days are not like the books twenty years ago.  They are darker and more violent.<br /><br />I read hundreds of children's books every year.  This series is one of the darkest series I have ever read (adult or children).  The first two books aren't that bad.  But you begin to get highly suspicious at the end of the second book, and in the third book your suspicions are confirmed.<br /><br />This series, if you are religious or even just believe in God, will shock you.  It is the story of Armageddon, except God is now old and feeble and doesn't help the world, and Satan is a much more benevolent being and if he ruled the world, the world would be a much better place.  The book says it is time for God to step down and let Satan rule in his place.  That Satan should have won the fight at the beginning of the world.  At the end of this book, a child with a knife.....well, you get picture.<br /><br />What amazes me is that since 85% of the population professes belief in God that these books have become so popular.  Most of the world's religions - Christians, Jews, Muslims - would not agree with the philosophies of these books.<br /><br />If you are going to buy them anyway, despite this review, please, please read them first before giving them to a child.  I deal with hundreds of children every day, and I promise you these books will impact a child a lot more than they would impact an adult.  Adults discern philosophies and manage to get past them while still maintaining their basic belief system.  Children and teens do not have this luxury.  The books they read and the movies they watch form their foundation of beliefs and philosophies.  As their guardian, parents are responsible for helping form these beliefs and philosophies toward life, moral values, and religion.  Please be careful with these books.still maintaining their basic belief system.  Children and teens do not have this luxury.

B00005JLSE|5.0|don't waste your time.  One must have a wry sense of humor, the ability to laugh at oneself and one's culture, and the mental capacity to understand this is a SATIRE to simply LOVE this film....and you will.  I find myself amused at the self-righteousness of pseudointellectual PC lapdogs whose reviews are represented here.<br /><br />It's a SATIRE, get it? To those who were upset because there was too much music...\\"Chicago\\" is a MUSICAL, capisci?  To those who abhored the violence and debauchery...Chicago is set in Chicago in the roaring 20s; what did you expect...I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings?  Good grief.<br /><br />Here's the thing:  If you have a sense of humor, a sense of irony, and common sense...see this movie.  It is an absolute delight.

B00003CXXJ|2.0|Shrek and its sequel are bland, trite, uncreative, wannabe-witty, and boring, but, inexplicably, both critics and audiences adore them. I've seen good movies, and Shrek is just not a good movie. Shrek is the Craig Kilborn of movies: it's smug and self-satisfied in its so-called irreverent attitude, while it faithfully repeats all the cliches it purports to lampoon.    How many viewers over the age of 4 didn't see the ending of Shrek (or Shrek 2) lumbering up Fifth Avenue? What a surprise! The princess chooses to be ugly! How incredibly irreverent in the most mind-numbingly politically correct way! What's the moral here? Be yourself? What attitude! What originality! Hamlet, step aside.    Hey, I know! Let's make a movie starring a kind-hearted but misunderstood hero with a witty, flippant sidekick! Never been done before. Oh wait, it has, but that's ok, because we're satirizing Disney! Let's fill it full of jokes that the parents will get but the kids won't! What a concept! Have we forgotten so soon what true attitude in kids' movies can be like? Can Shrek hold a candle to anything created by Jim Henson? I guess in the 21st century, jokes about bodily functions count as wit and attitude.    Shrek is product, plain and simple. Take big-name actors, throw in some snipes at Disney, throw in some crude jokes. But we have to make sure the movie succeeds: follow the standard cartoon movie story. Oh, we also have to make sure we don't offend anyone: Give it four or five passes through the political correctness machine.    I have to say that Eddie Murphy as the sidekick is funny. Restrained and subdued in a strange way, like the rest of the movie, but still funny. And Mike Myers does a decent job with the Scottish accent. I've seen many worse movies than Shrek; it's just that the obsequious fawning that everyone does is finally starting to get to me (can you tell?)     The Bourbon Chicken place at my local food court has a sign above it that reads: \\"It's not spicy! You'll love it!\\" I think that would be a perfect slogan for the Shrek movies. Shrek rips off Disney while claiming to parody it, while replacing Disney's warmth, humor, and character with cynicism, fart jokes, and cheap attempts at laughs.
0385512104|5.0|I have to admit I picked up this book because I was drawn to the bright red cover with the cutout of the upside-down dog (as well as the glowing staff recommendation that came with it). What I didn't know was that very reaction would foreshadow the book's very original story since the main character believes that red is a good color. I didn't expect this story to be so humorous and haunting at the same time, but author Mark Haddon in his first novel strikes a fine balance between the two throughout.<br /><br />\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is ostensibly a detective story but with quite a twist in having an autistic 15-year old named Christopher as the protagonist. He is incapable of lying or understanding metaphors or telling or appreciating jokes, i.e., he seems at first to be a younger \\"Mr. Spock\\" without the pointy ears. Everything registers in his mind as the same, and since he has no filters to eliminate the inane or insignificant, it becomes hugely challenging for him to deal with too many things at once. So when Christopher discovers his neighbor's poodle dead, skewered on a pitchfork, he sets out to solve the mystery and write an account of his investigation. In doing so, he inadvertently stumbles upon the emotionally complicated secrets of his parents and their neighbors, and the story becomes something much more.<br /><br />But rather than giving us a Hardy Boys take on \\"Rain Man\\", Haddon actually plays out his story like an updated version of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", as it becomes Christopher's search for his identity through his long-forgotten mother. This part of the journey, which takes him to the wilds of London, puts him into such sensory overload that the adventure becomes harrowing for someone who cannot handle change logically in his mind. The book makes for a fascinating and entertaining read, as Haddon plays with the concept of empathy, not only in Christopher's limited ability to empathize but also in our ability to empathize with him.  An audacious and creative book.udacious and creative book.
0679424741|5.0|McCullers has an insight into person psychology that allows her to create great characters that everyone can relate to. This is my third time reading this book. It is a great piece of work, and beautifully written. It is a superb memoir, and the author's style is impressive. The characters are as rich as any who have ever been imagined, and the story is just breathtaking. Highly recommended.
006092988X|5.0|This was just my summer reading book. I picked up the 483-page book and dreaded to begin reading it. In one afternoon i had read 203 pages after being completely captivated by Smith's marvelous story. She presents a life in which every single penny is looked upon as a huge amount of money. I have walked past pennies and haven't bother to pick them up thinking \\"its just a penny who cares\\". Smith creates the setting with a poor district in Brooklyn where a dollar is worth so much. We nowadays spend that much on a King Size Hershey's. I have a fresh outlook on life and on money and its value. Also, on how the Nolan family with so little find joys in the darkest of corners. Truly an amazing story. Highly reccommended.
B0001MDP36|2.0|Disney could have done a better job. Unbelievable that a movie about the pivotal events in American history wasn't made in America or had an American cast. Civil War reenactors work for free and the real Cold Mountain is in North Carolina. The accents, especially Nicole Kidman's, are atrocious. The script itself was sanitized to make it politically correct (the whole war is about slavery) and Inman is quoted as saying he doesn't believe in the war. (Not in the book) Very poor job. Read the book, skip the movie
B000002AH7|5.0|For one, I'd like to point out to the very well-informed Mr. Christopher Forbes that the concierto in question on Sketches of Spain is Concierto de Aranjuez: not the bastardised term he has used in his review. Thank you. <br />Sketches is a reflection of the brooding Miles Davis. One cannot help it: there's so much melancholy in the concierto itself that it is difficult not to wallow in its sad -- what some would call even wan -- beauty. The album, to me, is a swim through brooding naturescapes: I haven't been to Latin America, but closer home, I can imagine the solitary spirits that flit through our mountains. <br />One of my favourite tracks on this album happens to be the wistful Wil O' the Wisp. The flugelhorn...ah! I cannot explain exactly why, or analyse this tune by chord structures: it's an eerie yet comforting melody that, as a reviewer pointed out before, needs to be listened to and loved. The other aspect of this album is the stealthy percussion that builds to a crescendo. I cannot imagine Elvin Jones and Jose Mangual playing so BENEATH the overall music, yet holding the aural architecture together. It's a delicate balance. Few have achieved that.
0553573411|5.0|Once again I was VERY impressed with Hobb's writing and world building skill.  After reading the first two books of this series I almost feel like I actually know the characters.  A couple of them I really like and a bunch of them I really hate. It really makes it interesting when the author can actually make her readers care about the characters.  While this book might not be as complex as some of the other popular fantasy out there (George R Martin, Robert Jordan) its still a really great read and I would reccomend it to anybody!<br /><br />In Royal Assassin, Fitz has come back from the Mountain Kingdom knowing that he has enemies and even knowing who they are while still not being able to do anything about it.  Its incredibly frustrating for him to watch as his world is wrecked all around him and him being powerless to do as he wishes because his King forbids it.  Throughout the book, bad things just keep happening more and more and Prince Regal gets more and more blatant with his treachery until it all comes crashing down in the last part of the book.. The next in the series should be really great.  Hopefully Regal will get whats coming to him (as Im sure he will!)<br /><br />Definite *****!!
B000001Y5X|5.0|This was the very last Manson CD i bought, which i now consider a good thing  becuase if i would have gotten this first, all of his other work would have paled in comparason.  Oddly enough, this album retains a certian rough, unpolished, feel to it, becuase it was manson's first CD, but if you listen to him, he sounds like an old rock star coming back ten years after his heyday to dish out more music.  So in the end, it turns out sounding immature but at the same time, as if our little freind here knows damn well what hes doing.  Obviously i find this to be his best work, becuase it was his only rock album, and it sounded so out of place in the time it was made.  Now i love all of his other stuff, dont get me wrong.  But its obvious this could be the crap out of Golden AGe of Grotesque, with its weak porno lyrics, distorted vocals, and cheerleaders.   And when he didnt have the millions that he has now, the arch dandy didnt need stage props and flashy outfits to win over a crowd.   <br />Obviously this CD has tons of metaphors that will go over most of the heads of ignorant americans.  Such as 'Get Your Gunn,' which, although the bad connotations of the title, actually is referring to the killing of the abortion doctor, Doctor Gunn.  The songs main point is that killing abortion doctors doesnt make you pro-life.  And while 'Cake and Sodomy' may sound like a dirty excuse of a song, its a statement about the hypocracy of America.   'Wrapped in Plastic' asks us the maddening question 'does the plastic on the couch keep the dirt out, or does it keep it in?.'  And then theres 'lunchbox,' the most ironic track on portriat, for the lyrics 'i want to grow up, i want to a big rock and roll star' well, it happened.  But strangely enough, this track's main riff sounds musically familiar to that of Golden Age Of Grotesque's 'Ka-Boom Ka-Boom' execpt the lyrics are the exact oppasite.  Listen, youll hear it. And of course one of my favorites 'Dogma' thats all about religious persicution, and then 'Misery Machine' a spoof on a scooby doo song, which explains why i found it sort of familiar. <br />Not only does this album pack a painfull punch on the American way of life, it intoxicates you with guitar solos (something you wont find in ANY of his other CDs besides the remix ep...)and his crashing vocals, and will no doubt leave you doing air guitars all the while sitting there in deep thought. <br />For all you  people that act like this music is corruptive and sick, well i have two things to say: <br />1.) All hes doing is telling the truth, and you have no room to hate someone for that becuase chances are you watch the news and you watch those images of soldiers getting their heads cut off becuase, hey! its the news! <br />2.)If your morals are so strong and youve done such a good job raising your children, than you why are you so easily shaken by one man?  If you truely belived in the thigns you belive and teach than none of this would even scare you.

0790729393|5.0|This is one of the more intersenting film inyears that I have ever seen . Levinson has made a movie in which we can enjoy every little detail and meanwhile to appreciate the broad gusto and the amazing script that surrounds this dark story .<br /><br />Four kids , an accident a twist of fate : The hell kitchen will be the mouth of the tunnel that bitter stage will become them in disturbed man , and their lives will never the same .<br /><br />The first recognizement is obviously to that legendary actor who does not live with us anymore: Vittorio Gassman , his role is secondary but his presence literally covers all the screen and shades the others .<br /><br />Bacon is flamboyant as the saddistic police , he really makes you to hate this character his miserability and behavior acting is played with naturality without any drop of effectism .<br /><br />De Niro as the modern priest is excellent . ( This is his third role as priest ) .<br /><br />Levinson makes a camera work as the Gods . There are several sequences which proves that statement .<br /><br />The second part when they have grown up allows to Brad Pitt and Jason Patric to build the merciless and meticulous plan who will work out to perfection .<br /><br />The final is more than predictable , but the echoes of the Count still keeps beating .

B000069HK2|5.0|Their sound is mix of screamo/emo/punk but really is no comparisons to any other band out there. They have their own unique sound and their music is just mind blowing. All songs deserves a 10/10! Theres no skipping tracks here. Theres also a hidden track called \\"CHOKE ME\\" at the end. Definately worth your money. Go get it NOW!
0440418569|2.0|I loved The Golden Compass and loved The Subtle Knife even more. I reserved a copy of this book before it was released and bought it in hardcover. And I couldn't give a hoot about the anti-Christian message.     But Philip Pullman sure got himself in a tangle in this one. The ending was contrived, confusing, and needlessly tragic -- as if he felt that he needed a tragic ending, so he contorted his world until it became inevitable. And there were so many philosophical and religious allegories that it seemed the author lost track of them almost as much as I did. Because I'm totally susceptible to having my strings pulled, I sobbed for hours when I finished it, but when I dried my tears I was MAD, MAD, MAD.
B00005QIPH|3.0|I've heard it most of this record before from the Velvet Underground, the Pixies and especially the Feelies.  I don't understand all the hype, yes they're talented, the music is sometimes catchy but mostly its only OK.  Every song has the same sound/formula.  The melodies aren't compelling enough to hold my attention for long and its hard for me to get past the singers obvious fixation with Lou Reed.<br />See them live if you want to get a true perspective as to how \\"good\\" they are:  the singer is one of the most boring frontmen I've ever witnessed (are you that tired with being a rock star already?), the band isn't half bad though, but not that special.  I saw them at the Khyber in Philly which is a small club and later at Little Stevens Underground Garage fest where they were severely blown off the stage by men old enough to be their grandfathers, ie Iggy and the Stooges.  The Strokes popularity seems to be yet another triumph of commerse over art.  I don't hate them, they're OK and for a first album this ones not bad at all and has some catchy tunes. I'm just confounded by the amount of their success.
B00006BTCA|5.0|How many times can you listen to the same songs before you can never listen to them again?   <br />Interpol gets so many backhanded compliments...things like: \\"I like Interpol, but because I'm one of the few, divine musically 'enlightened', I have to open all of your eyes by telling you that Joy Division and E&tBM are better and did it first....\\" <br />If you dig a band and their songs make you feel good (or bad, depending), that should be enough to make them worthy of your hard-earned $14. <br />As for me, I like this CD, and I recommend it. I listened to most of these songs about 20 times before they started to get old.
B000002JS6|5.0|This album will always be tainted with a slight aura of sadness (and happiness as well) for me: Bon had just died and nobody thought that AC/DC would survive.  But we were wrong, this is arguably their finest moment.  Its an album that defined a moment in time for me, long gone, and it rocks as hard today as it did back then.  The song Back in Black has one of the greatest and most memorable riffs of all time.  What made AC/DC great is that these boys played some of the groovingest hard rock ever laid down by the hand of man.  Its damn funky and kicks like a drunken skinhead in a bar bust up.  All hail the mighty Young brothers and their inestimable collaborators: Brian Johnson, Phil Rudd and Cliff Williams.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|Nothing this addictive can be good for you. These songs are so catchy - FF are like the pop artists of a genre that can't really be called pop (in the US, at least). Yet, no matter how well-crafted this album is, it'll wear you out long before you wear it out.  Burn it off a friend, but don't spend your money.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Why is this album five stars?  Let me explain: Shot Down In Flames, Girls Got Rhythm, and Highway To Hell.  Oh yeah, the other songs rock as well.  This is AC/DC's finest hour with Bon Scott.  I love Brian, but Bon will always be AC/DC's singer to me.  This is their hard rockin' best.  I remember what music, especially the radio, was like when this was released, this album was salvation.
B0002IU988|3.0|The driving force behind Alter Bridge is Mark Tremonti.<br /><br />The first release \\"Open Your Eyes\\" is a great song.  The video showcases Mark's excellent guitar work with almost no screen time give to Brian Marshall - I had to check to make sure there were actually four people in the band.  The concept of the video seems to be lacking as the band sings with a burned-out forest as the backdrop.<br /><br />Alter Bridge is not Creed but its own band.<br /><br />I have to admit I am not totally on-board with Myles Kennedy has the new lead singer.  Personally I'd much rather hear Mark sing.  It has taken me a while to absorb his voice. The best comparison I can make is that of Van Halen - I never really did warm up to Sammy Hagar after he stepped-in to fill the place of David Lee Roth.  No one can really fill in the shoes of Scott Stapp - he was the essence of Creed.<br /><br />These are my favorite songs off the album (ranked in descending order):<br /><br />001 Open Your Eyes<br /><br />002 Broken Wings<br /><br />003 In Loving Memory<br /><br />004 Shed My Skin<br /><br />005 Burn it Down<br /><br />If you are a die-hard Creed fan like me then you need this album for your collection - mainly because of Mark Tremonti.<br /><br />If you're looking for the fourth studio album from `Creed' this is not it.  We need to cherish the 3 studio albums they gave us.
B000002KIK|4.0|I bought this album when it came out and initially I was very disappointed and shelved it.  I recently replayed it and found I'd made a mistake. This album is a very good closer to the first and greatest chapter in Black Sabbath's career.<br />On Never Say Die we find a band in transition. The doom metal sound pioneered by Sabbath is largely gone.  Darker themed songs such as Into the Void or War Pigs have been replaced with a more positive atmosphere.  The guitars are still heavy but Sabbath got more experimental with this album, flirting with jazz and even horns on the instrumental \\"Break Out\\". The album sounds like the bridge between old-school doom laden Sabbath and a more '80s sounding metal album, albeit one with a hell of a lot more experimentation and variety than most metal bands attempted in the '80s.<br /><br />Not everything works such as the aforementioned Break Out.  But there some great hard hitting rockers: \\"Never Say Die\\", \\"Jonny Blade\\", \\"Hard Road\\", and \\"Shock Wave\\".  The Bill Ward sung song \\"Swinging the Chain\\" closes out the album and is an excellent heavy song (Ozzy plays harmonica on this one).  \\"Juniors Eyes\\" is a standout blues influenced track with tremendous guitar playing, but its not in the typical Black Sabbath mode.  The most unusual song, the excellent \\"Air Dance\\" has some very fast jazz inflected soloing from Tony.<br /><br />Fantastic stuff, but I can see why this album is slagged by the fans.  Its strengths which are its experimention with new song forms and its flirtation with jazz are also to many fans \\"Never Say Dies\\" weakness.  It doesn't sound like previous Black Sabbath albums.  The songs are more overtly positive, its not the old doom and heavyness we came to expect from Sabbath, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  \\"Never Say Die\\" is better than the previous album \\"Technical Ecstacy\\" and for me is the last \\"real\\" Black Sabbath album.  After Ozzy left Black Sabbath retrenched, brought in Dio and went for a more overt and generic heavy metal sound, while Ozzy went on to fame and fortune with his solo career. Its a good thing that Ozzy left too, it was to the benefit of all involved because obviously they couldn't work together anymore and were pulling in different directions.  Those Sabbath fans with open ears should like this last effort with Ozzy.  Check it out.sound, while Ozzy went on to fame and fortune with his solo career.

B000002LGQ|4.0|...some people don't seem to get the transition between Dear Jessie and Oh Father and say silly things like \\"Dear Jessie is out of place\\".  On the contrary, it is exactly where and what it should be......a contrast to Oh Father.  Madonna actually making an artistic statement!!!     Her most shining moment.  A few other good tunes.  Cherish is total crap and belonged on True Blue.
0517548232|3.0|The title of this book is very misleading.  It is called \\"Economics In One Lesson\\" but a better title would have been \\"Randomly Selected Economic Myths and Economist Pet Peeves\\".  Although this book is very interesting and makes many good points, it is not a good introduction to economics.  It is basically an economist whining about government interference in the economy and common economic myths.  This is fine stuff, but it is not \\"Economics In One Lesson\\" as the title implies.  For an introduction to economics you would be better off getting a good college economics textbook or How the Economy Works by Edmund Mennis.
B000286RKW|5.0|Because it's not a pure mafia movie like Godfather is the reason for my title. <br />Not only the best gangster movie ever made, but one of the best American movies ever made. <br />The entire cast is amazing and the period music used for the sountrack (there is no Goodfellas theme) is just great. <br />This movie does NOT glorify the mafia as some people will say, in fact if anything, it shows the downfall of a gangster that happened to be half Italian and involved with the Mafia. <br />As an aside, I recommend reading the book \\"Wiseguy\\" that the movie was based on.  Good stuff. <br />
B000002IP1|5.0|It would seem that it would be very hard for Phil Collins to top at critical and commercial success like \\"No Jacket Required\\" (1985 Grammy for Album of the Year), but Phil manages to do that with his fourth studio album \\"...But Seriously\\".  On this particular album, Phil changes directions quite a bit.   He abandons part of the formula that worked for the first three albums.  Instead of focusing (entirely) on his personal relationships, the dark psychedelic element, and the fun element - Phil takes a much more \\"serious\\" approach.   On this album he explores socio-economic and political themes.   He doesn't abandon the relationship theme, but on this album he takes a more mature and reflective approach to the relationships he is involved in.   Usually when artists take a change in direction like this, they are criticized - but for Phil Collins the new formula truly works.   This album didn't win the Grammy, but in my opinion this late 1989 release would be the impact album for 1990 - and thus gets my nod for the Best Album of 1990. <br /> <br />The horn element is still present on this album.  This has been a staple of Phil Collins' career.  There are six songs containing the Phenix Horns and one additional song  (\\"All of My Life\\") that has a Saxaphone.  This is roughly about the same percentage as he used the Horns on \\"No Jacket Required\\".   Like \\"No Jacket Required\\", the guitar and bass influence remains - along with the keyboard element that was introduced on \\"Hello, I Must Be Going\\".  One difference is that this album doesn't quite have the \\"thundering\\" Phil Collins percussions that the previous albums had. <br /> <br />Phil also brings some guest stars to this album.   I've never been a David Crosby fan.  In fact, when I heard that Crosby was going to be on this album, I was skeptical.  However - Crosby is terrific as he does background vocals on \\"Another Day in Paradise\\" and \\"That's Just the Way It Is\\".   Eric Clapton provides guitar on \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\" and Steve Winwood provides Hammond Organ on \\"All of My Life\\". <br /> <br />This album is terrific from Top to Bottom.  Here is a synopsis: <br /> <br />\\"Hang in Long Enough\\" - terrific horns in this song.  This is a song where we see some of the sociological elements that Phil brings as Phil provides \\"advice\\" for someone looking to take the next step and make it big. <br /> <br />\\"That's Just the Way It Is\\" - is one of the David Crosby background vocal songs.  This song discusses the theme of fighting and war.  Phil's line \\"If we agree that we can disagree\\" tells it all. <br /> <br />\\"Do You Remember\\" - This is a classic Phil collins ballad.  This was one of the singles released from the album.  It's a good song, but I'd also consider this the weakest track on the album. <br /> <br />\\"Something Happened on the Way To Heaven\\" - Not as \\"serious\\" as many of the other tracks and probably is the only true \\"throwback\\" song to the older albums.  This is another great horn based song that Phil reflects on a love (possibly his own) gone bad. <br /> <br />\\"Colours\\" - This is the best song on the album and possibly the best song that Phil has ever done.   Phil makes a political statement in this song as he presents an anti-apartheid stance.  Great horns, great lyrics.  This is a near 9 minute song (so radio in their great wisdom (chuckle) shied away away from that).  It is a two part song.   The first 2 1/2 minutes has a soft tone, then the song moves into a African percussion that leads to the horn based part.    Collins is very vocal about his feelings as he sends a direct message to (then) South African President PW Botha. <br /> <br />\\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\" - This was a very overplayed song on the radio, but it is a very underrated song.  Phil gives a very powerful vocal performance.  What I find most interesting his how Phil fuses his vocals and percussion with a blues based guitar (played by Eric Clapton) with a gospel choir in the background.  Again Phil takesa reflective approach to relationships. <br /> <br />\\"Another Day in Paradise\\" - This won the Grammy for \\"Record of the Year\\".  Crosby is terrific with the vocals.  In this song, Phil explores the plight of the homeless. <br /> <br />\\"Heat on the Street\\" - This is a hidden gem of a song.   Great horn based song.  This is more another socio as Phil explores themes of different socio-economic classes and socio-political differences between the \\"everyday\\" people and the \\"decision makers\\" in our society.   <br /> <br />\\"All of My Life\\" - Another hidden gem.  This is a softer sound.  Steve Winwood plays Hammond Organ and it really has Winwood feel to it.  It is one song  that has some of the classic thundering drums of Phil. <br /> <br />\\"Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\\" - A short, but great instrumental with Phil and the Phenix Horns. <br />   <br />\\"Father to Son\\" - A ballad in which Phil gives advice to his son based on the mistakes he made in his life and relationships. <br /> <br />\\"Find a Way to My Heart\\" - This is the finale.  It's not quite the finale that \\"Take Me Home\\" was on \\"No Jacket Required\\", but its still a fitting finale song.  This combines the Phil Collins ballad with an African percussion followed by some great horn work -great stuff. <br /> <br />As for the liner notes - it comes packaged very well.   All of the songs with the lyrics and musician credits are listed.  I like how the credits are in one section of the booklet and the lyrics are in the other section.    The only real drawback is that on like other albums, the Phil Collins' style handwriting makes things difficult to read.  Overall for this album,Phil delivers his best work.   The bar was truly raised high on this collection from Phil Collins.
B000002UAX|2.0|Now, normally a healthy dose of LSD will do wonders for a pop band stuck in the middle of its career and trying to shed its old image.  In this case, the fab 4 (the holy trinity of music if you listen to hippies) just waste four sides on noodling.  I give this 2 stars instead of 1 for the 3-4 scattered listenable tracks like \\"Sadie\\", \\"USSR\\", \\"Helter Skelter\\", maybe \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" if was on drugs, too.  Going through school in the 80s I have had THE GOD ALMIGHTY BEATLES shoved down my throat as \\"THE BEST BAND EVER YOU MUST BELIEVE SO OR DIE\\" long enough.  Truth is, the Beatles kinda suck, never more than here.<br /><br />You know what?  Most of their music is empty tunesmithing a la Burt Bacharach.  The only reason ol' Burt never caused such a ruckus is he had a bad haircut.  That generation of people was so self-obsessed and greedy that it left a smite upon the face of America for over 30 years.  All of that garbage about changing the world turned into a burned-out acceptance of the need to sell your soul for money.  Rot in your beckoning grave.  Take your \\"great\\" music with you.<br /><br />Being born in 1975, I should outlive you by a fair stretch, and by the time the \\"boomers\\" are finally reduced to dust, I'll be here still.  You see, there is a little thing called 'historical revisionism' which my generation and those after it (if we are prescient enough) will use to reduce your obsession with all things Beatle to an incomprehensible fad like the hula hoop or bellbottoms.  A time capsule that will be read by those alien to all of us in the future will dismiss your lack of vision as hedonistic idolization of youth culture.  Real music from the same era: Johnny Cash at Folsom, Velvet Underground, The Doors, Miles Davis, CCR, The Monks, and a few others will last longer.<br /><br />That is, if I have anything to say about it.<br /><br />Stop buying the White Album.  Go get something new and keep your blood circulating with discovery.
156898443X|5.0|This book is highly recommended for anyone who is or has gone through a difficult time in their life seemingly alone. I think it would be good reading and an object to have around for a child who has lost a loved one. <br /> <br />
B00005JMUA|5.0|More Dialogue and less action-packed than Vol. 1, Kill Bill Vol. 2, nevertheless, delivers the goods for those expecting a satisfying conclusion to this two-parter. Oh yeah, now this is fun movie watching. After the hilariously gorey Kill Bill 1, how on earth do you expect a sequel (which is actually just the 2nd part of the film) to top that? Why add some drama, create and atmosphere of intrigue and suspense, even some mystery, and a great eye gouging scene! I loved Kill Bill Vol.1 I mean I felt like I was watching a live action Anime! My sister happens to be an anime freak (I only claim to liking the Drangonball series) and she agreed that it was like an anime. Maybe that's why it is so, shall we say, unique. It takes the classic revenge story and puts a new twist on it, and thus Tarontino keeps his audience guessing thorugh the whole thing. The second and final volume in Quentin Tarantino's KILL BILL series is another stylish, sprawling masterwork. VOLUME 2 picks up where the first film left off, as The Bride resumes her quest to track down her former mentor, Bill and exact revenge. But before she gets to Bill, she must first take out the remaining minions who helped to slaughter her best friends and fianc&eacute;. First up is Budd a quiet but dangerous country boy who lives in a trailer. Next is Elle Driver a one-eyed vixen who doesn't appear to have a heart--or a conscience. As The Bride makes her way closer to Bill, scenes from her past are revisited, including her training with the angry and brutal Pai Mei. Finally, The Bride locates her man, sparking a truly unforgettable confrontation. In contrast to the nearly dialogue-free first volume, VOLUME 2 is filled with extended conversations that bring the story full circle. Watch both Kill Bill's back to back and you'll have one entertaining evening awaiting you. Sometimes 5 stars just isn't enough.
B0002HTZJI|4.0|Three reasons why I bought this CD on the day of its release. Firstly, because I love the Chili's. Secondly, because I was there, man!!! And thirdly, because the day I was there (Sat 19th June) I was disappointed by the fact I could hardly hear them. Unfortunately, we were about a quarter of a mile away from the stage, so apart from the sporadic sound, we couldn't see a great deal either. And before you say `why didn't you push your way to the front', we tried, and failed. So I wanted to hear it in all it's (albeit reproduced) glory.  <br /> <br />It's hard to tell if there are any songs taken from the day I was there, as I do not remember hearing any of the band `talk' between the tracks which are on the CD, e.g. Anthony cheekily announcing he has found a way to break into Buck Palace (the recording is supposedly an amalgamation of the three days, but how do I know if any tracks were taken from the 19th?).  <br /> <br />I have played the CD almost everyday since purchase, and can honestly say it will fit nicely into my top ten. It has a raw, energetic sound, but at the same time an unpolished edge. If you have a sound system worth a few quid, this CD will not bring out the best in your set-up. Possibly due to hurried production, I don't know, but I have other live recordings with far more clarity. This is a shame, because instrumentally and vocally the Chili's are a rather talented bunch, and I was hoping to be able to define each instrument clearly. Flea was born to Bass, but it doesn't come across with much `funk' on the CD. I can forgive this though, because it's still a superb `ball's out' experience.  <br /> <br />True music aficionados can clearly hear various different musical influences from the Chili's. Certainly on the more bluesy numbers, there are undertones of the great Led Zeppelin.  <br /> <br />If you were at the concert, you couldn't fail to notice how diverse the crowd were. This is the appeal of this band, the fact that they can draw a huge crowdof people from all walks of life; rich or poor, old or young, hippies, rockers, rappers and funksters, there's something for everyone. The supposed hardcore fans who moan that this album only appeals to those who like the `radio friendly' Chili Peppers have a point. But as the old saying goes, you can please some of the people some of the time,....etc.  <br />To be a great and long lasting band, you have to have a hardcore fan base. To be a truly great band, you have to appeal to all.  <br /> <br />Apart from maybe your Grandmother.... <br />
6302814782|5.0|The Lost Boys will be a remembered classic. The cast is superb.<br /><br />Can't go wrong the gorgeous Kiefer Sutherland and Jason Patrick.<br /><br />After a divorice, Lucy (Wiest) who plays the mom, brings her sons, Michael (Patrick) and Sam (Haim) to live with her father in Santa Carla, \\"The Murder Capital of the World.\\" Unbeknownst to them, this picturesque town is filled with vampires.<br /><br />Michael gets \\"a taste\\" of this experience and Sam has to learn how to make things right again. In come the Frog brothers, who are dedicated vampire slayers. Together they encounter the horrors of the world of the undead. The cinematography is well done, with slow motion shots, emphasizing a seducing effect.<br /><br />The background music is pure rock, the area shots striking.<br /><br />There are some great one liners that Haim spouts out, adding a sense of slap stick comedy into the works. This is just a cool movie. Plain and simple. The special effects are well done.<br /><br />From flashing glimpses to graphic throat gouges and spurting blood. I highly recomend this movie to be in anyone's collection.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|It actually was a fluke when I picked this album up at a chapters.  I had heard Johnny's cover of \\"hurt\\" on a smallville episode and was immediately taken in by this haunting rendition. His voice is so sombre and solid, it just oozes emotion.  Each of the songs he takes and means every single word as he sings them.  My only complaint is that a listen to the album the whole way through can leave you feeling slightly depressed, but you know what it's worth it.  I'm only sad I never listend to Johnny Cash before he died.  He was definitely ahead of his time, and found ways to relaunch himself with each passing decade.  If more artists were like Johnny Cash the world would be a much better place.  Buy this now!
B00028HBKM|4.0|It is sometimes difficult to imagine why and especially how Christ suffered and died in order to make peace between God and Man. This movie tries to display that suffering so that people understand what He experienced.  This movie is overly graphic in the depiction of the violence against Him, but brings home the reality of Sin in the Christian context.  Sin cuts Man off from God; Christ mission was to seal that breach. \\"Look, Mother,\\" he says, I make things right.\\"   <br /> <br />Although I found the Aramaic initially annoying, Gibson paced and placed the subtitles so that you could follow along without missing a scene.  It seems the choice of language is two-fold: one to appropriately depict the language of the times and also, I believe to keep us slightly distant from such a painful display - as though we had some way to look back at it all.  Gibson was extremely brave because the scourging and crucifixtion are extremely painful to experience and could have sent people away in droves.  However, I think Gibson tries to focus on the purpose of His suffering.  Satan (wonderfully protrayed as a mocking amorphous being) confronts Christ in the garden and tells him that NO ONE MAN can take on the sins of the world  - and that's why such a display of violence: each lash, each drop of blood, each thorn, each nail, is sin upon sin visited upon Him so that Man would not suffer separation from God.  That being said, comments from Protestant nay-sayers who revile Gibson's message as being overly Catholic only show their bitterness toward Catholicism and miss Christ's message just as the Reformatists did so long ago - submission.
B00006879E|1.0|This has to be the worst album Ive ever bought in my life!!!Its SUCKS!I wouldn't even give it a single star but since its the lowest rating,I dont have a choice....Maroon 5 should be incarcerated for making \\"music\\" that makes me wanna throw up!Please dont buy this CD.Dont waste your hard earned money on a bunch of wimps who try to sound like Justin Timberlake with instruments and dont be deceived by the catchy pop tunes of their hit single \\"this love\\" cuz that's the only song in the entire album which is worth listening to
B0000AZAUM|4.0|Don't get me wrong.  I love this album and the way it sounds on sacd is incredible.  But now they have come out with the 30th Anniversary Edition that has extra songs, but not on sacd.  I want to get the extra songs, but not at the expense of the sacd sound.  And it is silly to have to have two copies of the same cd.  Virgin needs to do what MCA has done for The Who's Tommy, a special edition sacd version to satisfy those of us that enjoy extra tracks as well as top notch sound quality!
B0000028WD|3.0|OK, I was there.  It was an amazing show, just based on the sheer volume of greats in the building.  Cash, Wonder, Nelson, Petty, Colvin, Kristopherson, Havens, Clapton, Mellencamp, Wood, Winter, Chapman, Carpenter, McGuinn, Hynde, Young, Harrison...are you kidding?  What a fitting tribute to Dylan.  I've seen Clapton 10 times, and Ive NEVER seen him better.  If you ever get to watch the video of this; watch Steve Cropper shaking his head in disbelief as Clapton finishes up on \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright.\\"  Amazing.  Stevie Wonder just soars on \\"Blowin',\\" and the ensemble perfomance of \\"My Back Pages\\" was truly memorable.  But the performance of the night was Neil Young.  Honestly, I can't even describe how amazing he was.  When he sang the line, \\"I'm Going back To New York City...I Do Believe I've Had Enough,\\" the Garden was just about ready to implode. <br /> <br />This album is a nice way to further cement the memories of that night...but it's been cleaned up to the point that you can actually comprehend what Bob was singing.  That's just not how it was.
B000286S8S|5.0|Just saw Van Halen in Las Vegas. They just blew me away. Van Halen has not lost a step. It was great to the the master Eddie at work. Sammy is a true musician, Alex did a flawless solo and Michael holds his own. Just buy the CD for the new songs, they are as timeless as the classics. Only if some of the so called new bands could learn a lesson from the veterans.
B00008DDRX|4.0|I just bought this DVD last weekend, took it home and immediately popped it in the player.  First impression: Gorgeous picture and fantastic sound.  I recently bought a progressive-scan player and component input TV, and this disc looks incredible.  There's a scene at the start of the race where the ornate, ceremonial French flag drops in super slow-motion.  I felt as though I could reach out and feel the texture of the material.  Uncanny. <br /> <br />The sound is very good as well.  It's true Dolby digital 5.1, with just the right amount of surround in the mix.  (The surround channels are most noticeable in the crowd scenes during the victory celebrations, virtually pulling you into the action.) <br /> <br />No extras on the DVD, but the outstanding quality of what there is more than makes up for it. <br /> <br />I last saw this movie in '71 when it first came out (I was 18).  My feeling then, as now, is that it's thin on plot, but what do you expect?  It's about RACING, spectacular footage of some of the most exciting racing cars ever built on one of the greatest (and most dangerous) circuits in the world.  Having said that, McQueen's performance has just the right amount of measured aloofness.  A true classic!
B000002U82|5.0|there must be something wrong with you. My mate Dil introduced me to the `Floyd' in 1978. I was ten!!! He played me `Money' on his dad's stereo, and I thought `what's this? It's something completely Alien to me, but I like it'. Bearing in mind in the 70's all us kiddie Brit's ever heard was chart music, and for most of the 70's it was all Disco, Glam Rock, and novelty records. The only other music I knew was around, but didn't like, was Punk.     You were only really into Punk if you were a disaffected teenager, lived in squalor, anti everything, smash the system, etc. Disco sucked (at the time). And Glam Rock was so tacky it was an embarrassment (I'm talking Slade, Gary Glitter, The Sweet,.....ohhhh, I can't go on). But the thing is, it's all you ever thought music was.    Then I got into DSOTM in a big way. It was the sort of album I could play all through my teens, without my parents thinking `he'll grow out of it'. I'm 36 now, and I still feel I can play the album anywhere, anytime, without being thought of as living in the past. Every time I hear it, something new comes shining through. You can play it on your headphones, and when it's finished, it feels like someone's taken out your brain, polished it, and put it back.     It has to be said, as the years go by it gets better. Two reasons, firstly as recording technology and HiFi systems improve, the album's depth and detail becomes more apparent. And secondly, as you get older, the lyrics start to make more sense.     The line on `Time' that starts `And you run and you run to catch up with the sun...' for example, would mean nothing to a teenager. And as you grow older, your political stances change, and you begin to appreciate lines from `Us and Them' such as `for want of the price, of tea and a slice, the old man died'. And the line from the same song `the General sat, and the lines on the map, moved from side to side', are more meaningful today than they have ever been.    God gave man the ability to make music. I hope he is pleased.
1563898586|5.0|The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen (Book version)  5 Stars <br />The Story: <br /> 1898: England is in danger and a group of people with extraordinary talents are assembled to save king and country.  Including: <br /> Mina Murray, recently divorced after the `Dracula' incident, she is the team leader.  Though possessing no real extraordinary talents, she is very smart, crafty, adaptable and always proper. <br /> Allan Quatermain, former African adventurer.  An excellent shot, smart, brave and handy in any tight situation. <br /> Captain Nemo, long believed dead, Nemo has `resurfaced' along with his tentacled ship the Nautilus.  Merciless and grim, he provides the team with many of his own inventions for various uses. <br /> Dr. Henry Jekyll and his inseparable shadow: Edward Hyde, provide the muscle for the team.  Although neither one can be trusted, they are an important part of the team. <br /> Dr. Hawley Griffin, the infamous invisible man.  A man without any moral limits, he proves to be useful, but quite unpredictable. <br /> Now with the heros assembled, can they save England and is there more to this than meets the eye? <br /> An enjoyable read, filled with action and adventure and even some laughs.  Better in some ways to some of Alan Moore's other comics, but without any of the drama or preachiness.  Good entertainment, although I wouldn't let any kids read this who weren't used to rated R material. <br />(Warning: Spoilers!) <br /> Now for the hard truth.  I'm sick and tired of everyone calling this better than the movie or even worse: more accurate! <br /> Item 1: I find it very hard to swallow that the British government at that time would put a woman in charge!  And besides that, a woman with no qualifications whatsoever!  I mean, just because she was bit by a vampire suddenly she's who everybody calls?  And while in the real book you see some the guts she seems to have in the comic book, she's hardly a superhero.  While we're on the subject of thebook, did any of these people read that!  The final page of the book clearly states that Mina and Jonathan lived a long happy life together, not to mention had a kid!  Meanwhile in the movie it makes sense: She's been turned into a vampire, her husbands dead and manages to control her bestial urges and the government hires her because of her extraordinary talents.  Admittedly it still tampers with the book, but certainly no worse. (Besides, which leader would you rather follow: Sean Connery or Peta Wilson?) <br /> Item 2: People are blaming the movie for turning Jekyll and Hyde into a Hulk wannabe?  In the comic Dr. Jekyll mentions that he used to be taller than Mr. Hyde.  In the comic it's explained because Jekyll's `metabolism' changed, any stress will turn him into the hul'------Mr. Hyde.  In the comic Hyde is now a huge ape-like, super strong monster totally willing to tear people to shreds. <br /> Item 3: did somebody forget to mention that the Invisible Man was going stark raving mad before the mob got him? <br /> Item 4: am I the only one who notices the picture of Dorian Gray on the cover of the graphic novel?  Besides, anyone who's read the plot of the movie knows why he's in there.  (Don't ask about Tom Sawyer) <br /> Item 5: I hardly think Moriarty would be stupid enough to grab onto something floating into space.  To anyone who cares, I thought the Pollyanna joke to be quite offensive and unnecessary.  Who are the characters in the picture of a 1787 league of Extraordinary people?  I know one's Gulliver but who are the other's?  Especially The Reverend Dr. Syn? <br /> In conclusion, the comic is an excellent five-star read, but it's just as disloyal to the original material as the movie is. <br />
B00003CX9E|2.0|I think I found the comment by one reviewer, \\"I don't care about his stupid @55 sled\\", more entertaining than the actual movie. But then again,. someone has said it gets better the more you watch it.<br /><br />meh,. yay for the stupid @55 sled.
B00001OH7P|5.0|The Who, the Kinks, Pink Floyd, Genesis, Lou Reed--the roster of bands that decided the three minute single and the 30 minute album were beneath their artistic ambitions is a long one.  Even today, groups ranging from Outkast to Wilco assemble their autobiographical pensees in CD form.  But the best one is \\"Ziggy Stardust.\\"  Not only is the music fantastic--by turns delicate, soulful and crunchy--but the story is cool, and told in a fascinating way.<br /><br />Apparently (and there is plenty of room for interpretation), this is a story of how a rock and roller who might be an alien, or at least appears to be one to his fans, helped the young people of earth cope with a global catastrophe.  Just as the Beatles healed the English speaking world after Kennedy's death, and Elvis helped America recover from the horrors of McCarthyism and the hydrogen bomb, the fictional Ziggy Stardust, a sexy androgynous figure not unlike Bowie himself, redeemed the world in the aftermath of a \\"When Worlds Collide\\" type forecast of imminent doom.<br /><br />The story is told by fans, groupies, and by members of the Spiders from Mars who backed Ziggy on stage and in his biggest hits, \\"Hang Onto Yourself\\" and \\"Suffragette City.\\"  The final song, \\"Rock and Roll Suicide,\\" is the most mysterious... is it Ziggy himself, retiring from the stage, the burden too much?  Again, room for interpretation.<br /><br />The story says a lot about the healing power of rock and roll, and picks up Bowie's \\"superman\\" obsessions from Hunky Dory and other albums--Ziggy's stardom is based in part on his being some kind of advanced, magical being.  In some ways, what Bowie has to say is disturbing, but there is a great deal of truth to it.  Rock is the ultimate populist art form, but, paradoxically, its greatest stars seem to live in a world most of us will never inhabit.
B0002IU988|5.0|Myles Kennedy was just the right addition.  I liked Creed, don't get me wrong, but their music was pretty dismal lately.  Sad downer songs.  Alter Bridge is upbeat good feeling type stuff for the most part.  Great guitar pieces, great vocals.  I bought the cd and love it.
B000002JSN|5.0|This is Zep at their peak.<br /><br />A very consistant 2 CD set.<br /><br />Well recomended for Zep fans.
B000002LK1|5.0|A perfect balance of Art and Commerce. It's no surprise this is their best-selling album. It is perfect in every way. The songs, the performance,  the production, the mix.It just all falls into place. The only sad thing is that they will never again reach these heights. Pity.
B000002JSP|3.0|This is by far the weakest CD from Zep before the end of the band.<br /><br />All Of My Love and Hot Dog are the standout tracks.<br /><br />I'm gonna Crawl is not bad either.<br /><br />Never to be great again.
0375805613|5.0|I loved this book when I was little! It stars Sesame Street's lovable blue monster Grover who has heard a rumor of a monster being at the end of this book. Thoughout the story, Grover tries to stop the reader from reading on as each page brings him closer to the monster at the end of the book. But the reader will soon find out thet Grover can't stop the pages from being turned. A very enjoyable book to read.
0440238609|5.0|I read this when I was 14, and was brainwashed by Pullman's Anti-Religion theme. Oh... wait... sorry, no I was already Atheist, never mind then.  <br /> <br />While other's may have you belive that these books are dangerous to children, I must pose the question, are religous beliefs so fragile that a childhood of going to ceremonies, performing various rituals, reading Holdy texts, and being schooled in your religion so easily washed away by a fictional novel? Why are you threatened by such harmless fantasty? Indeed, it is almost self fulfilling how religous response to Pullman's books have the very dark, controlling, characteristics as \\"The Authority\\" (or God) in Pullman's books.  <br /> <br />Further more, is it right to limit the reading of your children to books only you think are appropriate?  <br /> <br />Who's doing the brainwashing now?
B00027JZ3E|4.0|Love it or hate it - It's a great example of 80's cinema - from the clothes to the music to the cheesy one liners to the \\"Coreys\\" This movie has it all. And VAMPIRES. The story line is somewhat predictable - divorcee moves with two sons to small CA town (the town has the dubious distinction as the murder capitol) to live with her dad. Eldest son meets local girl who is involved with the town um... gang? Little bro meets a couple of guys that give weird warnings about goings on in the town and mom falls for her knew boss. Everything is of course connected and there is a nice flashy showdown at the end.  <br /> <br />The clothes: Corey Haim is supposed to be this cool \\"fashion victim\\" kid that should exemplify the 80's - look at any of his clothes - did you know anyone wearing that stuff? Jamie Gertz's character was another one that just looked laughable in most the attire that they put her in. The skirts... Come on. Keiffer Sutherland was just about the only cool looking one in this movie and that's only because - How can he not look cool? <br /> <br />The music: I still like this sound track if only because it has a lot of nastalgic value for me. But most of the songs are really bad. The covers of \\"Don't let the sun go Down on Me\\" and \\"People are Strange\\" aren't as god as the originals. Lost in the Shadows (The Lost Boys) by Lou Gramm is possibly the most cheesy 80s song on the track and my least favorite. Why do they ever feel they have to write songs with the movie title in it? <br /> <br />So overall if I look too hard at this movie now I cringe but... Keiffer Sutherland is great and scarey (as always). The Coreys before drugs took over. Jason Patric before all the he became too \\"good\\" for these type of movies - we won't mention Speed 2. And hey - one of the vampire gang is Bill (the one that isn't Keanu Reeves) from Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure. How can I not love it?
B00009V7T2|4.0|yeah it's a weird album. eccentric, artsy, and all around strange. stick it in the cd player and play it through a few times. if you didn't like it the first time, you most likely will by the time you go to take it back out. <br /> <br />at times beautiful, always experimental, and never pretentious. more art focoused bands should be like this. <br /> <br />keep it up boys.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Fahrenheit 9/11 has done a great job by exposing the lies and hypocrisy of the Bush administration.  Moore even shows Rumsfeld meeting with Saddam in 1983.  Unfortunately, he does not explain the context of this meeting.  Saddam had just gassed the Kurds, and Pres. Reagan decided to improve Iraq's diplomatic status.  Rumsfeld was sent as an envoy to seal the deal.  Back then he was our friend.  Today, the story of the Kurds being gassed is constantly repeated while the story of how the US gov't rewarded him is somehow missing.    F9/11 has provoked a great deal more political discussion than is typical in American society and that's valuable in and of itself.    However, I think the movie has some important problems.  One is that he underplays the Democrat role in all these policies.  While he criticizes them for being passive lame ducks, this is inaccurate.  They truth is, they supported the Bush administration's policies, they just would have done it \\"differently.\\"  It's good cop/bad cop.    In the movie, we see how Black congresspeople needed one Senator's signature to further investigate electoral fraud in Florida and nobody would sign - including Sen. John Kerry! [this is not mentioned in the movie].    The film emphasizes the Bush family's personal connections to oil interests as the overriding motive for his policies.  The implication is that since Kerry doesn't have these ties, he would not carry on the policies.  He omits that obvious fact that, between the Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. administrations, there were two Clinton administrations.  What were the Saudis and oil corporations doing then - just sitting around and waiting for Republicans to get back into office?  The fact is that American oil policy is not driven by personal friendships but by the needs of empire.  Even if we did not have an oil-based economy, we would still want to control Iraq's oil if only because other countries [Russia, Japan, Germany] are dependent on it.  In capitalist competition, one often accumulates resources not for direct consumption but to prevent rivals from acquiring it.    Also, where were the protests?  The only protest you see in the movie is the inaugural, but not the Feb. 15, 2003 or any other anti-war protest.  One would get the impression that everyone else is just sitting around getting upset at Bush but doing little about it other than complaining.    The barely hidden logic behind Moore's movie is that the Democrats might only be a little better, but they'd still be better or at least more susceptible to popular pressure.  This is not supported by history.  It was Democrats who initiated and continued the Vietnam War [Kennedy, Johnson], while it was a cold war Republican [Nixon] who ended US military involvement.  The arms race that Reagan is blamed for actually started under Carter.  Reagan simply continued and expanded it.    Neither party is inherently \\"better\\" or more open to working people.  Both are representatives of empire [I would argue that a third party would be subject to the same contraints but that's another discussion].      The strength of this movie lies in Moore's compassion for working people.  The segment on Lila Lipscomb, a conservative Democrat whose son dies during the war, is powerful.  Here we see the transformation of someone who initially hated the anti-war movement to someone who is now questioning the Bush administration policies.  Moore is never less than respectful with her.    The scenes where the Marines recruit in the working-class mall, with overwhelmingly Black consumers contrasts with the various Congresspeople who would not even consider sending their own children to fight a war that they helped initiate.  Aren't Bush, Jr.'s daughters military age?    Whether this is properly a documentary or not is irrelevant.  Those who would dismiss F9/11 as propaganda, would not hold Fox News to such a standard - and they claim to be \\"fair and balanced.\\"  Moore's politics are not a secret, so nobody should have been surprised.  There are others who claim that he has no factual support.  Really?  Why don't you go to michaelmoore.com to see his documentation?  They include such marginal 'leftist' sources such as PBS, CNN, Congressional testimony, etc.,    Even with my disagreements with him, I feel that we are share the same outrage.  Moore is a very skilled filmmaker.  His use of music, editing and humor combined with his pro-working class approach make him a valuable resource, one that many progressive filmmakers should learn from.
B00008AWOG|5.0|I was an major Opeth fan before buying Still Life (MAYH, BWP, D1, D2), but the first few times I listened to Still Life, I thought I wasted my money.  Then I forced myself to listen to it repeatedly, and it is now my favorite Opeth album. <br /> <br />It is a mix of prog/death metal and acoustic rock, but it NEVER gets boring.  These guys are just too good.
B000007489|5.0|This is one of the greatest punk rock albums of all time.  If you like music to be fast, loud and sadistic, this album is for you.
B0002IU988|5.0|This album was a highly anticipated album by me, a very long and dear fan of Creed and Mark Tremonti.  I have looked at Mark as a guitar hero for many years.  His amazing work on all three of the Creed albums has shown his great abilities.   <br /> <br />Now, on \\"One Day Remains\\" with his new band, Alter Bridge, Mark shows his true side of raw Rock and Roll.  This album rocks harder than any Creed album ever could.  The good thing about this album is that it showcases each individual band member's talents very well.  There are the ballads, which showcase new frontman Myles Kennedy's amazing vocal range and ability.  There are the out-of-this-world guitar solos that Mark throws down throughout the album.  There are amazing drum solos and great, technical drum rhythms throughout that show how awesome a drummer Scott Phillips is.  Last but not least, back in action is bass player Brian Marshall with his awesome bass runs and his great rhythmic ability. <br /> <br />Overall, this album has surpassed my expectations tenfold.  I didn't know what to expect from the album at first.  I knew there would be some Creed elements on this album.  But for all of you Creed lovers, this album will make you happy because you have some of the Creed elements (on songs such as \\"The End Is Here\\" and \\"In Loving Memory\\" - which will probably be the Alter Bridge version of \\"With Arms Wide Open\\") and it also shows the hard-rocking side of the guys on tracks like \\"Metalingus\\", \\"Find The Real\\", and \\"Watch Your Words\\". <br /> <br />Get out and buy this album today and check them out on tour!!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|I wanted to judge for myself, so I saw the documentary and I'm glad I did  !  I cried, I got angry , I got informed, and finally some of the things that have been happening made sense, and some things didn't really shock me, because I've always suspected that the Government hides alot of things from the people and the Government is also very crooked.  I suggested the movie to all my co-workers, even those that condemned the film before they even saw it ! I told them to see for themselves and make up their own minds after seeing 911. and I bet them that they would think differently.  I am going to buy the film as soon as it comes out, because I see it as very educational and I want my grandkids and everyone else to see it.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I have been a fan of Josh since catching him on Ally McBeal and he has only improved with time.  I loved his first album and I actually have two copies of Closer - one for work and one for home!  He has a truly amazing talent and can bring me to tears with his songs \\"To Where You Are\\" & \\"Remember When It Rained\\".  Josh sings every song with such passion & emotion that you start to imagine he's singing directly to you.  I highly recommend buying all of Josh's CDs & DVDs, you won't be sorry.   <br /> <br />And if by some small chance you don't like it, forward it to S. E. Heimsath \\"M. McFly's dentist.  The dentist obviously has good taste in music. His patients are another story....
B000066I6N|1.0|This is by far one of the most disappointing CDs I have bought from an established artist. What the heck happened??
0399242864|5.0|A very sweet story that all young kids would like.  Great illustrations as well
B000006IUQ|1.0|I thought this was the worst film I had ever seen. Then I saw Antitrust. The Edge is now the second worst film I have ever seen. <br /> <br />Still, I got a good laugh out of the part where the desperate city-folk stranded in the wilderness use POINTED STICKS to defeat the merciless man-eating bear twice their height - and then appear in the very next scene in very dapper, matching bear-skin vests.
B000025XX0|5.0|This second volume of Queen's Greatest Hits covers the years 1981 to 1991.  During this time period, Queen's popularity in the US dropped drastically.  In fact, only two songs from this CD, \\"Under Pressure\\" and \\"Radio Ga Ga\\", were legitimate hits in America.  In the UK, however, Queen remained as popular as ever.  Every song here was a hit in the UK, with nine of them reaching the Top Ten.  This CD should prove to Americans what the British knew all along; that Queen was still producing good music after they dropped off of the US charts.  Highly recommended.
B00005JMAH|4.0|First of all, I want to say that I have read all of the books available.  I am a huge fan of Harry Potter.  I also enjoyed this movie immensely.  I agree that changes were made and things were moved around but the overall feeling of what JK Rowling was trying to convey remained the same.  I am not sure when but I did read an interview once that stated that JK Rowling approved of what Cuaron did with the film.  If she was OK with it, then I am too. <br /> <br />As the books get longer, it becomes harder and harder to fit everything in.  Artistic licence had to be taken in order to make it manageable.  When you go to see the film, it may be helpful to remember that it is a movie in its own right and to view it as such.  Do not immediately start judging it based on how the book went and you should enjoy it just fine. <br /> <br />For the people who say that too much was left out, I agree with you in some respects.  There were aspects of the book which were left out that should have been kept due to the fact that they play important roles in the next books. <br /> <br />At least with the movie being different, people can't say, \\"oh well I've seen the movie so I don't need to read the book.\\"  :-) <br /> <br />Oh, and one last comment.  To the reviewer who stated that they didn't like the set location due to it looking more like Scotland then England...  Hogwarts Castle is located in Scotland.  While the students all depart from Kings Cross Station in London, the Hogwarts Express takes them to Scotland.  Please do not feel that I am in any way infringing on your rights to review..  I respect everyone's opinion regardless of whether it agrees with my own or not.  I just wanted to point out that little fact.  Perhaps it might give you a greater appreciation for the cinematography in the film.  Feel free to disagree with me anytime.  :-)
B00007E8O5|5.0|Aside from Dirt, AIC never really released a concept album and even then one could argue that \\"Dirt\\" is merely a series of songs on a related topic (heroine addiction) that are not tied together in a coherent way.  As good an album as Dirt is, Degradation Trip is better.  Not only is it coherent the album as a whole seems to tell a story. <br /> <br />Musically, Cantrell is at his best.  He broods, he jangles, and the vocal harmonies are nothing short of staggering.  There's not a bad song on this album.  People who are not into \\"hard rock\\" (whatever that is... music is music... who cares if it's Jerry Cantrell or Mozart if it moves you) may not find this album appealing, but they probably will not be reading this review either.  If you like AIC and you're on the fence, do yourself a favor and by this album.  If you're looking for new music and you are ok with fairly heavy stuff, chances are this album will knock your socks off.
B0001ZX0PG|3.0|Eastwood always manages to get some good performances out of his actors.  He presents them with a set totally relaxed, and yet super efficient, so that several scenes--scenes which would take most other directors days apiece to film--can be completed within one day.  This produces an exhilaration, almost a roller coaster feel when compared to the ordinarily glacial pace of most bug studio filmmaking.  Sean Penn gives his best performance in MYSTIC RIVER, and Tom Robbins is also unforgettable.  Poor Kevin Bacon on the other hand is saddled with a ludicrous role as the policeman whose wife has gone AWOL, and when this storyline resolves with a final phone call, you could hear people in the theater break into derisive laughter for it is so cheeseball.<br /><br />In general the women are not as well served as the men, and Laura Linney in particular is badly miscast as a sour, nearly unreadable Boston Lady Macbeth.  Meanwhile Marcia Gay Harden is running all over town casting glances of loathing and suspicion at her poor husband, telegraphing his ending a mile away.  I wonder if this film isn't Clint's allegory for Cold War politics, with Harden playing one of those called by HUAC who wound up \\"naming names.\\"  The three boys who play Penn, Bacon and Robbins as little boys are remarkable like their adult counterparts, a sign of the care Eastwood displays throughout every minute of this vital, leathery tale of revenge and displacement.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This movie is a perfect Description of Bush's 4 years in office-horror, tradgedy, and destruction. Yet another moore classic, he blends the truth with reality and values. A must see.
0792839730|5.0|It is said that the producers paid each of the international stars a million dollars apiece to act in A BRIDGE TOO FAR, one of the most vital and impressive war sagas ever made.  Usually I dislike Richard Attenborough as a director, but here he really runs with the stick and delivers the goods.  It is a fast, quick-paced epic with an intimate feel and a master's touch for displaying the very best of Allied bravery and German cunning.  Dirk Bogarde, the underrated, now nearly forgotten star of many bisexual and art movies, here turns up playing what is essentially the Bad General role; dashing, understated and elegant, you feel that he is really living the part.  Playing the real life husband of romance writer Daphne Du Maurier, Bogarde is alternately catty and precise.  Sean Connery isn't in it very much, but he gives his lines a nice brogue.  I was also impressed by the Americans Robert Redford and Ryan O'Neal who, in their only film together, show that not only the British people were valiant in the Market Garden operation.<br /><br />I also liked Lawrence Olivier as the Dutch doctor overseeing Liv Ullmann in helping the sick and wounded.  It is probably the best part Olivier had in his later movies, miles better than THE BETSY or A LITTLE ROMANCE, and as for Liv Ullmann, her part was good too and she looks like an angel of mercy, as she tries to help all the suffering ones of World War II.  If she had appeared in more movies (in English), the world would have been a gentler place.  Funny to think about fame and how so many of the people who were great stars back then, aren't so big any more.  Of course Olivier and Bogarde have died, but would you give O'Neal, or Ullmann, or Elliott Gould, a million dollars today to be in your movie?  But Hackman, Connery, Caine, and Hopkins are still stars, kind of.  And Robert Redford is in a class by himself.
0385512104|5.0|A wonderfully touching story. One of those writers who points out the poignant bittersweet humour in the difficulties and painful experiences of life. Will have you laughing and then realising you shouldn't be. Makes you feel as if you've witnessed an insight into an otherwise inaccessible mind. I loved it for it's originality and it's excellent style. Read it!
B0001FAFL8|5.0|I still enjoy this album very much today. There is their very beautiful hit \\"I'm not scared\\" produced by the Pet Shop Boys. That song along makes it all worth. Then there are their other hits like \\"Will you remember\\" and \\"Baby baby\\" with Patsy's nice and warm voice. She doesn't have the strongest voice, but she has charm. All songs are chosen well and support Patsy. it's a shame she gave up her singing career after this album. I wish there would be more releases by Patsy Kensit & Eighth Wonder
0316666343|5.0|I personally could not put this book down.  I loved this story because it was told from a unique point of view.  The book is not perfect but I will remember this book for a long time.
B00003W8NM|4.0|An overwhelming organization extended in multiples cells, all capable of action without any central leadership, the middle children of history, and God's unwanted generations (this is Project Mayhem); Gentlemen, welcome to Fight Club! Things that don't concern Project Mayhem and its members are: Poverty and Anarchy. Things that do concern Project Mayhem and its members are: some guy's name in the underwear, T.V. with 500 channels, Viagra, Rogaine, Olestra, and mass consuming, to hell with Martha Stewart. The Founder and President of Project Mayhem is: Tyler Durden (Durden means Death in some Nordic dialect). To fight between themselves and let it all out: pain, shame, deception, anger, fear, etc. Now it has move from the basements on to the surface, a full army packed with a lot of soap and a solid Idealistic view of human life. Actually, the more they size things up, the more they hate modern civilization and its superficial way of life. Mundane existence and the hunter essential gathering of sh..., they don't need, those are their essential enemies, also the life style of the rich and famous but, that's another story. Today's Society has become all about materialistic possessions, the more you have, the more you are as a person. Enough already with passive criticism, Action needs to take on, So far, So good.  Fight Club is a unique story of every day odds against the uncomfortable human tolerance that has become all about consuming, we are consumers, and we at some point asks the inexorable question of our own existence that has become nothing more than a compulsive pushing for the perfect life in this none sense world of Sit-Coms and junk food, slowly learning the fact that we will never be Rock Stars or movie Gods, even though we have been raised to believed it (a quite hypocrite statement by movie God: Brad Pitt), in contrast, the more you are an stupid and superficial teen, the more you will fit into this society (Teens are the biggest social group of consumers, and maybe, the dumbest of all. Almost every market have target them), buy today's top music hits, buy today's latest designer's clothes, buy today's newest video game, buy sex, buy your happiness, this is your life, and is ending one second at a time.   The audacious and keen artisan, David Fincher, narrates with a fine eye and straight style the anarchical story written by Chuck Palahniuk, of this underground fighting clubs, and how its individuals develops a revolution of idealistic breakthrough, towards self freedom. Eye opener, violent, and rough, Fight Club is an honest and fair critic towards this superficiality. Of course, Palahniuk takes it to the extremes, and Fincher portraits it with humor and deep understanding of its concept and message. Brad Pitt as the anthological Tyler Durden, brings credibility and force to this character, a very good performance, Edward Norton as The Narrator (also known as Cornelius, Travis, and other stupid names), conveys both fragility and moral strength to his excellent work, both actors and the director as a team are simply magnificent. Helena Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf are great two. But, what is the pathological profile of The Narrator and Tyler Durden, both as the same person? Well let me tell you: According to the DSM-IV (Diagnostic Criteria for the most common Mental Disorders), the two protagonist (as one individual), clearly shows the patterns of the Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly Multiple Personality Disorder, 300.14). The various criteria for this disorder are: A. The presence of two or more distinct identities or personality states (each with its own relatively enduring pattern of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and self). B. At least two of these identities or personality states recurrently take control of the person's behavior. C. Inability to recall important personal information that is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness. D. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behavior during Alcohol Intoxication) or a general medical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures). In children, the symptoms are not attributable to imaginary playmates or other fantasy play.   Individuals with Dissociative Identity Disorder may manifest post traumatic symptoms (e.g., nightmares, flashbacks, and startle responses) or Post traumatic Stress Disorder. Self-mutilation and suicidal and aggressive behavior may occur. Some individuals may have a repetitive pattern of relationships involving physical and sexual abuse. Certain identities may experience conversion symptoms (e.g., pseudoseizures), or have unusual abilities to control pain or other physical symptoms. Individuals with this disorder may also have symptoms that meet criteria for Mood, Substance-Related, Sexual, Eating, or Sleep Disorders. Self-mutilative behavior, impulsivity, and sudden and intense changes in relationships may warrant a concurrent diagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder. Dissociative Identity Disorder appears to have a fluctuating clinical course that tends to be chronic and recurrent. So, I hope this explains it to you, dear Amazon reader.   An accurate and psychologically intone photography adds a lot to the film's content, also the excellent music by the Dust Brothers, brings more humor to the humoristic scenes and more power to the Fight and moral exposure scenes. Great script, but the problem of the film is that it's ambiguity doesn't lets the narration explain in a more clear way certain events of the story. Any way, this doesn't really hurts the movie.   The two DVD versions are excellent and full of good extras, specially the Two Disc Special Edition. The visual and sound transferring is perfect, an ideal movie to watch on DVD.   So, to resume Fight Club's message, and that is: just to give you the finger man, so watch out with the soap Punk.
B000286RKW|5.0|\\"Goodfellas,\\" #94 on AFI's list of 100 greatest movies of all time, is widely regarded as the best mob movie ever made by critics and audiences alike. Written by Nicholas Pileggi and based on his book \\"Wiseguy\\", \\"Goodfellas\\" charts the meteoric rise and catastrophic crash and burn of tough guy, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta). Hill was a small time thug whose involvement with the mafia paved the way for the most daring narcotics ring ever established in the U.S. Hill's teaming with the very dapper, very savvy, Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and the very foul-mouthed Tommy De Vito (Joe Pesci) is at once fortuitous and frustrating as Hill watches Conway and De Vito rise to great heights within organized crime while he remains the front runner of lowly accord. The trio's mob boss, Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino) befriends Hill but the association is short lived after their latest heist goes horribly awry. Brutally violent and viscerally disarming, the first time viewing experience of \\"Goodfellas\\" is very much like riding a psychotic horse through a burning barn - particularly in the latter half when Hill's own drug addiction leads to a manic and paranoid existence.   <br /> <br />As for the quality of this newly minted DVD, there is a marginal improvement between this disc and the original flipper from Warner.  Flesh tones are overall accurate but there continues to be a reddish tint in certain scenes. A murky haze continues to be present during the early scenes.  Digital anomalies are completely absent for an overall smooth look that is appealing. Fine details, black levels and contrast levels are bang on. The image quality will surely NOT disappoint.  <br />The soundtrack to \\"Goodfellas\\" is a very finely wrought 5.1 presentation. Dialogue is perhaps a bit more front sounding than one would expect - though no less bold and ironically crystal clear. The effects and music tracks really pack a wallop.   <br />Extras include commentary tracks, plus a host of featurettes and a thorough documentary on the making of the film. Overall, this is a great edition to any home theater aficionado's library and it comes highly recommended. <br /> <br />
B0000CDL93|5.0|Understand this: film making is an Art / Industry. Art because of its all-dominant story narration (a film will always tell a story), that's why it has an Author (the director), with his or hers point of view of that single story. Its an industry because all of the human effort and huge amounts of money used to bring into screen any type of story. Unfortunately in many countries and specially in Hollywood Big Studio System, it's become all about making money, this is the Gringo way. And so, every once in while filmmaking is brought to the art level, and even better, more rarely a director with a soul and conscience delivers an important film to society and art in general, this is the case with Oliver Stone's J.F.K. Stone asks 150 questions about President Kennedy's murder, maybe he got 5 things wrong, but what about the other 145 things he got right? The Big Shots where afraid of a man that could have change things for better, wiping out their biggest moneymaker: WAR, taking away all their Power (both politically and military). Frustrated with this possibility, it became evident Kennedy had to be put to rest. If you follow the clues, understanding them in their context to the end, you will know WHO did it, and WHY they did it. J.F.K does something that has become more and more rarely in the USA film industry; it makes you Think!   Jim Garrison's fearless quest for truth against a corrupted Government has no parallel in U.S.A history, and Oliver Stone takes such a brave and honest piece of Gringo history, narrating it with his unique straight and Powerful style (the best word that describes this brilliant film). Stone has the courage to point you with his finger and say: How dare you sons of bit... The film's magnificent script was stolen twice beginning shooting. Censorship (back up by who knows who), tried to stop the movie from being shown in theaters. Fortunately the film made it to the screen. Only a keen and masterful director like Oliver Stone is capable to make such a Masterpiece, all the praises to him and his crew. More than speculations the movie becomes aware of the facts. The complexity of the script becomes a puzzle put in order. Kennedy's shot to the face, the most ridiculous bullet in all history (more spin offs and turns would had made this bullet a ballet dancer), the Shadow Conspiracy shown here with that breathtaking speech from Donald Sutherland's character inter cut with Stone's trade mark black and white documentary photography and fast paced editing. Vietnam, money, power thirst, the Zapruder film as the main key evidence, is right in your face; this is pure and honest patriotism. Further than entertainment, is captivating, the movie won't let you turn your face away. What more could you ask for? But there is more, this film will test time and go along for new generations to communicate and pass on the knowledge of this tragic event, provoking an insight conscience in every new spectator, it can't be forgotten by obvious reasons.  The new Directors Cut, features 17 minutes of never before seen footage, making the view richer, the extras will make more complete the whole picture as well as the points of view of the objective Insight especially the simultaneous commentary audio track by Oliver Stone, and the Assassination Update (The New Documents), Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy, feature-length documentary, and Meet Mr. X: The Personality and Thoughts of Fletcher Prouty. So, this is a must for your DVD collection (both the Double Disc Special Edition, Director's Cut, and the Single Disc Special Edition, Director's Cut are great).  The last thing to say about J.F.K is that it is more shocking today than it was yesterday. Why? Because it reflects today's corruption and manipulation of a Government that carries on with blood in its hands, and bloody hands are never washed clean, a lesson not enough thought in schools, its ugly but some one has to do it. J.F.K message is: Do not forget!
B00005JLR8|5.0|There are several reasons that make this movie powerful and heartbreaking but it is mainly the five incredible actors that make this a film you remember for a long time. A film that is able to give you a little hope for a better world, and a hope for immigrants or new begginers everywhere. This is a movie of a family struggling with many new beginings. New life in America and a new life without a beloved member of the family. A new life for every member of the family trying to find his new place in the world, a world without a son and a brother. The mother, played by Samantha Morton is candid and touching in every scene. One of the strongest scenes is the fight scene between wife and husband. He confronts her and asks if putting herself in risk in order to have another baby indeed protects her children as she claims to be doing...\\"Yes\\" she answers confidently (with all her body) and with an inner logic you are able to understand after watching and learning her character throughout the movie. What she means is that having another child and trying to hang on to life is what's going to keep this family together. The husband, played by Paddy Considine is unable to understand her at this point of the story but the viewer is able to see his full torn character. We get to see bits and pieces of the way he was in the past and the inner turmoil he is undergoing. It seems that he is putting such a strong act for normality on the outside that there is not much power left for emotions he needs to \\"feel\\" for his acting roles. Or so I explained this to myself.    <br />Mateo played by Dijmon Hounsou looks like an Egyptian God - his strong face is powerful even in sickness and so are the words he speaks in an African accent. There is something very majestic in all his moves, especially in his final action.  <br />Emma Bolger - Arielle (\\"We're on Holiday and my Dad's not working...\\") is sweet and lovely but I feel that the elder sister (Sarah Bolger) is the one giving the movie itsadded value. She is powerful even in her silence and the things she is able to say. \\"In America\\" is her story and is brought to us in her words. Christy is able to understand reality in full but she is unable to let go of her belief in magic and its powers. This belief is part of her inability to let go of her dead brother (whom she pleads to let go of her)  The striking difference between the way she sees the world and the reality as the adults and the viewers see it is the main ache in this movie.   <br />In spite of the emotional upheaval you undergo while watching this movie and its many strong moments, you do not feel as if you are being emotionally played with, as all seems like a normal happening.  I loved everything about this film. The script is heartbreaking and told in a way that tears you apart. The music is quite surprising as some of it is unfamiliar and the rest can seem totally out of place at times. A very happy tune is heard in the scene starting with a blooming yellow flower.. Spring is coming and the baby is born but this is not a happy moment. Great pain and worry are on the screen. \\"Do not wake me up if something happens to the baby\\" says the mother to her husband. The contrast between the music you hear and what happens on screen is totally striking but is able nevertheless to add to the harmony of this movie as all senses are part of the experience and the sound of the music only sharpens what you see (happy? Sad? Life is a combination). <br />The DVD holds an additions part with scenes deleted during the editing. These parts hold no surprises as most of them are further elaboration of scenes the movie holds. However they were very nice to watch.  There was one deleted scene I liked especially which was a slightly different version of the ending I enjoyed better. The additions part also elaborates on the personal story of Jim Sheridan on which the story is based. This is \\"nice to have\\" but often I feel I do not need to know \\"what's behind\\" as the movie itself was strong enough.  <br />

038551123X|2.0|Okay - I have never not finished a book before sending a review - but what is up with this book?!  This was reviewed in Time Magazine as a \\"must read\\".  PLEASE!  I was expecting a fabulous sinister dark scary delicious novel.  I am instead finding silly childish writing that is boring me to tears.  What happened?  The only reason I am even giving it 2 stars at mid novel is that \\"Dexter\\" can be occasionally funny.  Not sure if I will even finish this book. <br /> <br />Man - what a disappointment.
B00009V7P8|4.0|I like the reviewer ripping on Rice's lyrical talents with the quote, \\"the words themselves don't go good with the rhythm of the guitar.\\" No offense, and maybe it's just me, but that seems humorous. <br /> <br />To the point, I have heard only a few songs from this CD but I thought they were quite good. I didn't think the lyrics were as deep on those tracks as others seem to, but I enjoyed the songs nonetheless.
B000008JUM|1.0|This is a waste of money and time for a true Porter fan.  The premise for the benefit--raising AIDS awareness--was great; the results were a disaster.  Let's Don't Do It: don't buy this CD if you really like Cole Porter.  What a disappointment.
B00027JYLC|4.0|Traveling carnivals and freak sideshows experienced much popularity during the 19th and early 20th century. Large crowds eagerly paid five or ten cents to witness those with birth abnormalities on stage. Directed by Tod Browning and originally released in 1932, FREAKS provides a unique peek into the goings-on of the sideshow performers after hours. Devoid of any special effects no actors were recruited to play the various freaks in this film; each performer is authentic and truly existed in real life. Understandably, this aspect startled the cinema patrons of the early 1930's and continues to cause curiosity and unease today. <br /> <br />FREAKS speaks volumes of how society viewed those who are different from us in the past and present. The prevalence of social taboos and superstitions dictated that if a baby was born with any physical abnormality a bad omen has been delivered to the family. As highlighted in this film's introduction these children were often abandoned and ignored by society. Thankfully the advent of medical knowledge today has demonstrated how biology and genetics play a superceding role in these physical abnormalities resulting in the lifting of social taboos and superstitions and arrival of understanding. <br /> <br />There is little doubt that FREAKS is a groundbreaking film in cinematic history and it rightly deserves its recent re-release to DVD. Admittedly its length is short at only 61 minutes but it packs a punch. This is one of the few films that warrant immediate repeat viewings. Be sure to also watch the special features that puts this film in its historical and cinematic perspective. Recommended.
B000005ITX|5.0|Where do I start? Maybe I should explain the title of this review. It really is tragic that only five stars can be given, because this album deserves a lot more than that. Simply put, the best album I have ever heard in my life, and my favorite of all time is \\"Forever Changes.\\" 11 tracks that combine impeccable lyrics, smooth music, and an almost disturbing amount of beauty can be found on here. I bought this album the same day that I had the most devastating incident of my life, and it helped me profusely. It's funny that a band called Love could avoid the subject for the extreme majority of this LP.     Anyway, Arthur Lee believed that he was going to die at age 26, (He was only 22 at the time this was released, but that's not important.) and wanted this album to showcase his final words on Planet Earth. He's actually still alive today, but he still put out this flawless album while that fear of death loomed over him. The result is an enigmatic set of tracks that will completely captivate anyone with good taste in music (Sorry, Eminem fans, you aren't included.).     The album opens up with a beautiful stream of guitars providing us with the opening of \\"Alone Again Or,\\" a Bryan McLean track, and one of the most simplistic on the album. The mariachi horns and 2-part harmonies play up to this tracks enjoyability level, and sets the stage for the beauty that is to follow.  Following that light-hearted track, instant darkness is acheived with the ominous-sounding introduction to \\"A House Is Not A Motel.\\" This track is a lyrical showcase, probably having the most depth in that aspect of any of these songs. For proof I give you the final verse:    \\"By the time that I'm through singing the bells from the schools of wars will be ringing. More confusions, blood transfusions. The news today will be the movies for tomorrow, and the waters turned to blood, and if you don't thing so, go turn on your tub.\\"    That verse rendered me speechless on first listen. Next, \\"Andmoreagain\\" brings us verses of romance and majesty to soften the apocalyptic images of the previous track. For most of my friends who have the album, this is their favorite track, and not without good reason. It's a beautiful love song, sure to sooth out any anger you may be holding.  \\"The Daily Planet\\" is an acoustic rocker, and is the hardest song on the album. Here, Lee used double-tracking in ways not utilized before, by singing two different things over each other. Another ingenious decision by an ingenious frontman.  Following that, the most simple song on the album \\"Old Man,\\" gives us more romance to quell our confusion of the previous track. It is the second of two Bryan McLean tracks, and, like every song on here, is bursting with beauty.  Next comes a disturbing portrait of death and darkness in \\"The Red Telephone,\\" featuring lyrics of lost hope, a droning harpsichord, and a greatly disturbing ending (They're locking them up today. They're throwing away the key. I wonder who it'll be tomorrow, you or me.)  Following that track another lighthearted recovery track is given (recurring theme) in \\"Maybe The People Would Be The Times Or Between Clark & Hilldale.\\" This song was the reason I bought the album, and it is one of the two best songs on the album.  Next, \\"Live And Let Live\\" transports us back to where 'The Red Telephone' left off. It's another dark track that you will grow to love even more on repeated playings.  Following its predecessors, \\"The Good Humor Man He Sees Everything Like This\\" is another relief track, but by now you can't help but think, maybe this happiness is just a facade. Maybe there is no hope, and it's just here to draw us in. Anyway, it succeeds and things take a much lighter turn from here.   Now, most people would say that the first rap song is 'Rapture\\" by Blondie, but to those people I say \\"Be gone.\\" This may sound a bit racist to some of you, but there is no way that rap was started by a white girl. Anyway, Lee recorded the next track,\\"Bummer In The Summer,\\" over ten years before \\"Rapture\\" was released. Listening to this track, you will hear that this is in fact a rap song, and until I find a rap song released before 1967, I will regard this as the first rap song recorded.  Finally, the album closes with what will become your favorite track if you play the album enough, \\"You Set The Scene.\\" It is the most revealing track, as Lee openly speaks of his prediction of death with a mature acceptance. The whole album builds up to the final half of this song, and it delivers right here. The perfect (yes, perfect) climax to a perfect album.    So, in review, if you want to hear the best album of all time, then purchase \\"Forever Changes.\\" You shouldn't be disappointed, but if you are, get help.
B00028U6B8|5.0|I'm compelled to review this one to help offset the one-star review given this classic album by another reviewer.   <br />While I understand their frustration with the choice of bonus tracks, that's no reason to rate this great album so low in musical quality.  No matter what you think about the bonus material, the original album is still the second best Airplane album, after \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\".  It's their counterculture manifesto, and it wasn't just lip service on their part.  Grace Slick and Paul Kantner, especially, were very politically active at this point in their careers.  The two tracks that most define their message here are the title track (which served as an effective \\"revellie\\" at Woodstock) and \\"We Can Be Together\\", which quoted the radical battle cry \\"Up against the wall, [m-f'ers]!\\" (Gun-shy RCA substituted the word \\"Fred\\" on the lyric sheet - don't forget there were no \\"parental advisories\\" in those halcyon days). The rest of the album is great, too, especially their cover of David Crosby's \\"Wooden Ships\\" - they actually trump Crosby Stills and Nash's original version and add some lyrics of their own.  This is also Marty Balin's last album with the Airplane (he would return years later to join the retooled Jefferson Starship).  Add to that some great instrumental work (including piano from legendary sideman Nicky Hopkins) and you have a rockin' time capsule of the Woodstock era.  It's still one of my favorite albums of the Sixties, bonus tracks notwithstanding.
0783226063|4.0|Dune is a wonderfully complex story that would be hard for any filmmaker to translate to screen. Frank Herbert wrote a sci-fi classic ahead of its time, creating a mythology you could get lost in. The story is set in the year 10,091, when noble families control their own planets while paying homage to a galactic Emperor. People travel between the stars courtesy of the Spacing Guild, whose alien-like Navigators are able to fold space thanks to the all-empowering spice, the sole source of which is found on the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. <br />We are introduced to three noble families in this movie: House Atreides, the heroes; House Harkonnen, the villains; and House Corrino, the house of the Emperor (Jose Ferrer) who moves people around like pawns for his own political benefit and because \\"the spice must flow.\\" Duke Leto Atreides (Jurgen Prochnow) is told by his Emperor to move to Arrakis to assume control of spice mining. He must accept this \\"honor\\" but knows it is a trap, seeing he is replacing the avowed enemies of the Atreides, the Harkonnens. <br />The best thing for me about this movie was that it came out just after I discovered the Dune novels in early high school. It was timely and David Lynch presented the characters and images of Dune as I had imagined them in my head. When I go back and read Dune, I see Kyle MacLachlan's face as Paul Atreides and Francesca Annis' beauty in Lady Jessica and Kenneth McMillan's portrayal of the vile Baron Harkonnen. This movie was well cast, unlike the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries which featured a lot of European unknowns and put faces on the characters that just did not fit. Saskia Reeves is no Francesca Annis. <br />This version of Dune was panned and failed at the box office but came to be a cult classic. Some fans holding out for a more purist version got the Sci-Fi Channel version but found that too disappointed. Besides the necessary plot abbreviations Lynch had to make to fit the story into 137 minutes of film, the most notable departures Lynch makes from the novel are his embellishments of the horrors of the Harkonnens (think heart-plugs!) and the \\"weirding way\\" sound weapons. Other than that, I found Lynch to be faithful to the Dune mythology. <br />You may watch the movie now and think the FX are cheesy, but you have to remember this was 1984, before the great leaps in CGI that would come with T2. I was quite pleased with the FX - Lynch did a fantastic job with the sandworms and I liked the way the energy shields were done. Costumes and sets were good as well. The Harkonnen stormtroopers were satisfyingly brutal in their bio-warfare get-up, I was happy with the stillsuits and the desert scenes looked fine. The images of Geidi Prime (Harkonnen homeworld) convey the utter evil and corruption of the Harkonnens.
B0002234LS|4.0|Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) is an author going through a difficult divorce. He retreats to his secluded country home to work on a new book. One day, he is jolted from sleep by a stranger at his door. This man, named John Shooter (John Turturro), claims that Mort has plagiarized a short story that he wrote. Mort denies the accusation, claiming that he wrote the story first and can prove it. But John Shooter is determined to exact revenge.<br /><br />\\"Secret Window\\" is based on Stephen King's story \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\", published in his 1990 collection \\"Four Past Midnight\\". The story was adapted for the screen and directed by David Koepp. Koepp does an admirable job of manipulating the audience, creating suspense, and surprising us. Johnny Depp is perfect in the role of this slightly eccentric, suddenly spooked writer. John Turturro gives the most memorable performance of the film as the monotone, obsessed, menacing villain. I wouldn't have pictured Turturro in the role of a country bumpkin. It just goes to show the breadth of his talent. I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Secret Window\\". It looks good. The story is solid and layered. Director David Koepp is creative, clever, and has a great sense of timing.<br /><br />The DVD: Bonus features include four deleted scenes, three featurettes, \\"Animatics\\", and an audio commentary from director David Koepp. \\"From Book to Film\\" is a documentary featuring interviews with David Koepp and the film's cast. The first 10 minutes of it basically just recap the film. Then there is some discussion of casting and filming. I wouldn't bother with this one. \\"A Look Through It\\" is a better documentary. 30 minutes long, David Koepp talks about the decisions he made shooting key sequences in the film, such as the opening hotel sequence and shooting inside the cabin. \\"Secrets Revealed\\" is a 13-minute documentary discussing the final 15 minutes of the movie. If you're really interested, these last two documentaries are the ones to watch. \\"Animatics\\" shows what are essentially animated storyboards for four scenes in the film. There is no narration or explanation. I had already heard too much commentary from the director to want to listen to the film's audio commentary, so I can't comment on that except to say that director David Koepp is interesting and well-spoken, so you might want to give the commentary a try if an hour's worth of featurettes haven't satisfied you. Subtitles are available in English and French. Dubbing is available in French.matics\\" shows what are essentially animated storyboards for four scenes in the film.

B000000H64|5.0|I was recommended this by a friend when it came out in 95 and when I first heard those gutteral death metal growls I thought 'oh no, this ain't for me', but I gave it a chance and before long I was completely entranced by it.  <br />My dad thought it was absolute rubbish but I knew there was more to this than just brute noise and nearly 10 years on I can see that it is indeed the great piece of art I suspected it of being at the time.  <br />The eclectic singer Bell expresses his grief through an envisaged android martyr, set in a bleak T2 style future there is a constant overlap between present and future with Bell assuming man and societies current dysfunction will be emulated by the machines of the future with the result catastrophic!! <br />The anger and frustration that Bell feels is delivered harshly, sometimes serenely as in a choir and penned so very eloquently. <br />He is backed up by musicians so tight with their instruments the result is a machine like precision of artillery riffs and uber-drumming that sounds like the apocalypse itself!! <br />Rhys Fulbers ambient synth work is excellent and lends itself particularly well to the songs Zero Signal and Pisschrist. <br />There is only one good song on the album - New Breed - the rest are great!!
B00003CXCT|3.0|I would just like to add to all the other \\"reviews\\" that I would also have liked to have seen the Original Trilogy released on DVD in it's original form and they will be one day, trust me, but for the moment this is what we are getting. <br /> <br />I will be buying this set because I am a fan and can't wait to see these films again even though I have the originals on VHS and the Special Editions but my kids love these films so and they love Episodes 1 and 2. I was 8 years old when Star Wars was released in 1977 and would just like to say that I was in awe when I first saw it back then, seeing that Blockade Runner appearing then a massive StarDestoyer behind it was just amazing to me as it was to everyone else. If you do not want to buy this DVD then don't nobody is twisting your arms behind your backs forcing you to, I will be buying this DVD and when the Original version is released I will buy that too. <br /> <br />
B000002UAI|5.0|Read the critics reviews of this album at the time of it's release and you'll find that this is considered a step back for the Fab Four. However, I would like to dis-spell the myth this was an album that was sub-par to their previous offerings. <br />If you listen to Please Please Me it's raw. There's no dispute with that assessment. It's the energy that carries it moreso than anything else. With The Beatles was a forward step, not a huge leap, but none-the-less, it was ground-breaking for it's cover art alone. In this short period the Beatles were in demand to say the least. With touring, a feature movie, TV appearances, recording and other engagements so numerous they would scarcely get a day off. And if they did happen to get a day or two rest, they were confined to Hotel rooms. <br />When A Hard Days Night was released, the record was the boys first to feature only Lennon/McCartney originals. The album had some of the greatest songs they ever wrote. UA (United Artist) spent a decent amount on the promotion of the movie and the sound track. The album was packaged very nicely and sold extremely well. It was a well produced and well marketed album and movie. So when Bealtes For Sale came out, naturally there would be critical redicule without the huge movie studio budget and a short time to fulfill contract obligations, but I beg of you to consider this, if you listen to Please Please Me and With The Beatles, we have Lennon/McCartney originals and their standard covers they performed on stage. If you were to remove A Hard Days Night and you just had the progression from Please Please Me to With The Beatles to Beatles For Sale. You can plainly see that each album is a small step up from the previous. But because Beatles For Sale came after a hugely marketed movie sound track backed by UA, people dismissed it as a lesser album in their catalog. <br />At the very least, you should be able to agree with my assertion that Beatles For Sale is better than Please Please Meand With The Beatles. Just listen to Johns voice on the track Rock and Roll Music or the introspective self-loathing I'm A Loser. From the classic Eight Days A Week to Paul's raucous version of Kansas City. Some people didn't appreciate the greatness they heard back then. This album was a sign post for things to come. The Beatles as a more mature and quickly progressing rock band. Of course, hind-sight is 20/20 and I'm sure the years have changed some critics tunes! If you are just getting into the Beatles, I won't say get this album first or anything like that. But I will say get them all! You need to have all their albums! This is just a small piece of the story and it is less significant without the rest of this bands incredible catalog!
B00005JMAH|5.0|This movie is truly a huge accomplishment. Alfonso Cuaron, the brilliant new director took the bull by its horns and made this script that had great potential into a cinematic masterpiece. The acting is cleared up, all of the main trios' skills improved stunningly. The cinematography was beautiful, showing off the breath-taking landscapes of Hogwarts (and Scotland) in many scenes, including the wondrous scene of Buckbeak's Flight across the lakes and mountains of the campus. The soundtrack was the icing, topping off these lovely scenes and fitting along so well that you hardly notice it is even there. Alfonso Cuaron travelled into grounds that Columbus should have, ones that made this movie a huge improvement over the first two. Everything was so natural, so believable. his tendency for showing the Hogwarts campus in more depth and adding in tiny details and interactions between characters gave this movie the atmosphere the first two lacked. Finally, in this third installment, viewers were pulled into the movie, and actually cared what happened next, hoped for the safety of the kids, wondered endlessly as to who was the bad guy. But not just that, there was a lovely added sense of humour that this director held that made this suddenly dark dark movie give many times for the audience to catch its breath, and the lessen the tension. But no humour could lessen the tension at the dramatic climax to this movie which was pulled off spectacularly. As my son said: <br /> <br />\\"I have been in contact with many fellows of mine who saw the first two movies and laughed at their simple, candy-coated, watered-down staleness. But after seeing this movie, they are in love with the series, the director finally showing audiences that Harry Potter isn't just a child's story.\\"  <br /> <br />The reputation of Harry Potter is cleaned up, finally a movie worth standing in front of the series so flawlessly created by JK Rowling. If I had to make one complaint about this movie, it would have to be that it was too short! Hehe <br /> <br />
B00024BHTC|1.0|I agree with the privious review.  This album Sucks.  Why don't you bozos do a web search on symphonic rock?
B00008H2LB|5.0|For some reason I really like this band.  They are the Beastie Boys of new for me (15 years later).  I love their stuff.
B000002J1S|5.0|Wow! Where to start? I was 2 years old when this came out, but I discovered it when I was fourteen. This was one of the most important albums in my life! This is certainly the high water mark of Genesis and rival ANY concept album ever recorded. this  <br />album literally absorbed me and took me to another place every time I listen to it.  <br /> <br />I can't justify THE LAMB with any proper review due to the fact that if 10 people listen to it, they'll ponder ten different angles and interpertations. This is one of those rare recordings that you don't listen to, you EXPERIENCE it.  <br /> <br />The music shifts, bends, and generates a mellow flow from out of nowhere making every corner you turn a pleasent surprise. <br /> <br />This is certainly not for everyone, however if you believe that music is art and should be approached as such, then THE LAMB will be a serious contender for your <br />desert island senerio. <br />
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the beginning of the good stuff for this band.  Be careful buying this one, it is catchy and difficult to stop listening to.
B0000AR8NK|3.0|Things looked really good with the releases OUTSIDE, EARTHING, and HOURS, even HEATHEN had it's moments, but as much as I love Bowie's music, This left me flat. I tried to let it grow on me even in altered states of mind but to no avail. This album is by no means horrible, but measured against the last decade of his work, this is the weakest link in the chain. Then again, maybe I'm wrong to hold this album against others. You listen, you decide
B000286S8S|5.0|This is my style of music and I went to the concert this year in MN, USA (2004).  It was incredible and far surpassed previous concerts I have been to for Van Halen.  The album is great and there is a couple new songs on it worth hearing.  Go see them in concert and pick up the album beforehand.  Don't be a animal, get it!
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|I usually like 'strange' movies, but this one just..wasn't very good. It does have a good plot.. the story of his father..and the wonder whether the stories are true or not. I think this movie had a lot of potential, but I feel that it did not pull it off well. Many of the fantasy parts just seemeed unnecessary and much of the dialogue was bad. However, I did like the end.
B0000024JN|5.0|Like a fine wine that gets better with age.  Never been another album like it and will remain legendary.  Don't be surprised to find it in the Smithsonian Institute someday.
B00003CWTI|5.0|At first you think...what is this movie doing? About half way through you will be soaked into every scene. It is a story of forgiveness and relationships among people. Wonderful cinematogrpahy, screenplay, and acting. Tom Cruise stands out as a wacky character with his best acting to date. He was nominated for an Oscar, and truly deserved to win it. Julianne Moore plays a troubled woman married to an old dying man whom she never loved. William H. Macy is a child star with fame from a T.V. quiz. The lives of these people and others form a beautiful web of connections. If you are one of those people into 'artsy' or 'different' films, be sure to check this out.

Awesome Lyrics, the track includes a background vocal that gives to it a Funky vibe. This is the 2nd Single from the album and is set for a release soon !. <br /> <br />5. Heavy On My Heart: Impressive Ballad by Annie. One of the most inspiring tracks of 2004, the lyrics are heart - touching \\"So come and free me, It's so heavy on my heart, I've had my share of pleasure, And I've tasted pain\\".... <br /> <br />6. I Do (Featuring Sonny of P.O.D): This Song talks about saving the world of violence and Anger. Sonny (from P.O.D) is featured on this song. <br /> <br />7. Welcome to my Truth: In This One, Anastacia talks about love, that she is still loving after everything that happened.  <br />\\"Of a memory that now feels untrue, I used to feel disguised  <br />Now I leave the mask behind, Painting Pictures that aren't so blue\\"  <br /> <br />8.

One of my favorite songs of the Album. <br /> <br />9. Sexy Single: My 2nd Favorite of the Album. Anastacia really shows her talent on this one and is more than obvious when you are listening to the lyrics of the song. You go girl ! <br /> <br />10. Rearview: My Favorite track of the entire \\"Anastacia\\" album. At this point, you will think that your money was well spent. \\"So many things that we didn't say, So many reasons the world's not the same\\" Some People can relate to the lyrics of the song. <br /> <br />11. Where Do I Belong?: Beautiful & Sentimental Song. \\"Lightening strikes the pages keep on turning, Help me to be strong,I'm floating in a sea of strange believers , Where do I belong?\\" the lyrics touched my heart - Especially the First Section of the song when she says that life doesn't promise a bed of roses <br /> <br />12. Maybe Today: The Last Track but not the worst one. When I am at this point , I feel that I want more tracks on it !, this can't be the end of the album! <br /> <br />Overall, This Is One of the BEST CD's of the last 5 Years of the Music Industry, Buy It Now - You won't regret It. <br /> <br />Thanks for reading this review =)  <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore, Thank you. In the words of Sir William wallace,\\"FFFRRREEEEEEEEDDDDOOOOOOMMMMMM!!!!\\" In the words of Texas,\\" Come and Take it!\\" Democracy is about freedom, not corporate rule. How about one on the WTO and all that crap. Yeeahh!
B00004RJEG|5.0|After finally receiving this DVD with region one encoding(from Amazon Canada)I am more than a little angry that it has been withheld from the North American region for so many years.I had seen a couple of performances from this album on the Best of the Corrs Videos and had wanted to see the rest of the performance. I am absolutely ecstatic. The duet with Sharon and Caroline on \\"No Frontier\\" is so much superior than on the Landsdowne DVD. I had never heard the two of them sing solo before and their voices are amaxzing and so clear and true on this DVD. Watching and hearing Andrea sing \\"Little Wing\\" and \\"Everybody Hurts\\" is a treat in itself. What I really like about this \\"unplugged\\" performance is the ability to listen and to appreciate their vast musical skills without the noise and visual distractions of the concert audience. This makes the performance intimate and very special. I think I finally have all the available Corr's DVD's now and this will probably end up my favorite.
B000066NW0|3.0|Bla bla bla does anyone who's not an Avril fan actually doesn't like her because she/he simply doesn't like the music? Who cares if she's not punk? Everybody knows that, now get over it. <br />This is not a bad album, personally not really a big fan though. She have some pretty good songs(I'm With You, Unwanted, Tommorow, Too Much Too Ask) and the O.K ones. The only song I cannot absolutely stand is 'Sk8er Boi' which, for my taste, is just stupid. The lyrics are childish and just plain crap, the melody's O.K though but still ... <br />Another song which I'm not to keen on is 'Complicated' for the simple reason that it was played and re-played so many times that it makes me sick. <br />My personal favourite's 'I'm With You' although I don't like her singing at the end of it.She doesn't have a bad voice just not strong enough to sing some parts of it.I like the background of the song and the lyrics are less or more deep.  <br />That's it.But whether you like the album or not stays your choice. Like 'they' say: Each to their own.
0064407667|5.0|There's a feeling one gets at the recognition of greatness - I remember (although I was considerably younger) reading, for the first time, The Wizard of Oz. I knew I had found something special, remarkable, unique, and timeless. Such it was with others: James and the Giant Peach; A Wrinkle in Time; The Earthsea Trilogy; The Hobbit; The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe; Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone; and now this. <br /> <br />The back of the book, which warns us to stay away with such perfect, perfunctory humor, and the dedication to Beatrice, \\"dearest, darling, dead\\", told me immediately, before I had read a single word, that I was about to be delighted again. And the book did not disappoint.  <br /> <br />Some have criticized this book, and its many sequels, for its uneven portrayal of grownups. But I think they're missing the point. From the dedication forward (even, or especially by naming the family after Charles Baudelaire), this is pure satire, and with satire, anything is game. So we have clueless grownups, exaggerated villains, and they all serve to demonstrate the ridiculousness of common situations. It just so happens that in the middle of this all, we have a very entertaining little story about a horrible man (Count Olaf - what a glorious villain!) who wants to claim the Baudelaire fortune, and tries to accomplish this by tricking (er, forcing) Violet into marrying him. How they escape this plot is really quite clever, even if it isn't rocket science. But it's not supposed to be. <br /> <br />Friends of mine have found the books entertaining, but have put them down because they were too depressing. I challenge that with vigor. Although the Baudelaire's find themselves in melancholy situations, they always persevere through innovation, dedicated teamwork, tremendous love for each other, and a refusal to accept the \\"darkness\\" that Count Olaf brings to their lives. There can be no more affirming message than that. I found this book, and all those that followed, uplifting. <br />
B000286RKW|5.0|One of my 10 best, but the dvd says that it has english and spanish spoken languages,and its not true, it has english and french languages only,unless i got the wrong disc inside, if someone can tell me that all the dvds are the same, Ill be happy with it, if not i will return it and find one with spanish and english language traks,would sombody let me know,thanks
B000002IFP|5.0|Mick Hucknall's best album and one he is unlikely to repeat. This album has never dissapointed me even after all these years and after many more albums by Simply Red. Some of his best songs are in this album i.e. \\"It's only love\\", \\"You've got it\\", \\"If you don't know me by now\\"... There are just so many good songs here and I think it is the most polished album by Simply Red. The songs here are beautifully written, perfectly arranged and performed with much gusto. It is an all round great effort and the product is simply superb.<br />Unsurprisingly and unfortunately, Mick has never got to repeat this feat in his later albums. So forget about all those Greatest Hits albums and get this one, if you have to choose. Why? Because the jewel in this album is the last track not available on the other albums (I think) ... \\"Enough\\".<br />But, we have not had enough, Mick!!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears made a bomb cd. I'll give a song to song review to explain: <br /> <br />Track 1- Oops...I Did It Again. The song is awesome! I love the message! <br /> <br />Track 2- Stronger. This song is awesome! Very idependent. <br /> <br />Track 3- Don't Go Knocking On My Door. The hands down best song on the cd. This song has a little R&B mixed in it. <br /> <br />Track 4- (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction. This song is great. <br /> <br />Track 5- Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know. How can you say she can't sing when you hear a song like this? This is one of the most beautiful songs on the cd and I love it to death. One of my top 5 favorite songs of all time.  <br /> <br />Track 6- What You See (Is What You Get). Best pop song on the cd. Deals with real life issues (like most the songs on this C.D.) and it a total \\"Shower Belter.\\" <br /> <br />Track 7- Lucky. I guess I can understand where she's coming from. She may be famous, but she a human being just like the rest of us entitled to her privacy and not to be judged. Just because she may wear sexy clothes sometimes doesn't mean she's a slut. None of us know her so no one can judge or defend her. <br /> <br />Track 8- One Kiss From You. Catchy song. Too much like Baby...One More Time though. <br /> <br />Track 9- Where Are You Know. I love this song soooo much. It's really pretty and mellow and a great song to relax too. One of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. <br /> <br />Track 10- Can't Make You Love Me. Awesome. <br /> <br />Track 11- When Your Eyes Say It. Pretty boring at first, but when you sit down and listen to it, it's really beautiful. <br /> <br />Track 12- Dear Diary. This is the most ridiculed song on the album, but I fall to pieces listening to it. It's sooooo much like what so many teen girls go through with boys, and when I sing it I feel every single lyric in my heart (like I do with the entire C.D., actually).  <br /> <br />All in all Brit rox on this cd!!!!! <br /> <br />
B00006F83Y|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age's self-titled debut was heavy stoner rock, and the second album, Rated R, was somewhat of an experiment in a kind of mixture of pop and rock. Songs For The Deaf, however, seems to have settled with pure hard rock. While it's not as original and groundbreaking as the self-titled, and not as brave and experimental as Rated R, SFTD is one amazing CD. There's a wide variety of heavy rock music here, and just about every song is great, and the album flows really well. There are very few songs that one would skip. After hearing one song, you will want to keep listening to find out what's next. This is simply an amazing album. The songs and my reviews for them are:    1) You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar, But I Feel Like A Millionaire (10/10): The radio interlude in the beginning is kind of long, but that just helps to prepare for one loud, heavy song. With Nick Oliveri screaming 'till he's hoarse on vocals, this is obviouly one of the louder and faster tracks. The guitars and drumming are excellent, and while it can kind of become annoying after a while, this is still a good song.    2) No One Knows (10/10): Not only is this my favorite Queens of the Stone Age, it's also my favorite song of all time. It's the first song I heard from QOTSA, and it's what got me into them. The guitar riff is simple, but still amazing, and the drumming packs a lot of punch. The lyrics and vocals are also excellent. This song grabs hold of you and doesn't let go, and although it's been played on the radio a little too much, it is stil a perfect song through and through.    3) First It Giveth (8/10): I was never really a big fan of this song. That's not saying it's bad, though. The guitars have a cool sound to them, and the chorus is great.     4) Song For The Deaf (10/10): Another nearly-perfect song. Mark Lanegan is on vocals, the guitar playing is out of this world, and the drumming puts every other song on here to shame. This is my second favorite song on the CD. What can I say other than WOW.    5) The Sky Is Fallin' (9/10): A little too long and too slow. It sounds a lot like Radiohead, I kid you not. The chorus is pretty good, but the the radio \\"interlude\\" at the end kind of takes something away from the overall song. It's still great though, and one of my favorites.    6) Six Shooter (6/10): This song is pointless filler. I've barely listened to it all the way through, and even when I did it was because I was either too lazy to press the skip button or I just wasn't listening. Six Shooter is the reason why this CD has a parental advisory.    7) Hangin' Tree (8/10): With Mark Lanegan on vocals and some crazy sounding guitars, it's a surprise that this becomes such a boring song. A lot of people will probably like it, but I don't really. I usually skip this one.    8) Go With The Flow (10/10): This song sounds more like pop than most of the songs on the album,k but it's still great. The great drumming, simple keyboard and excellent lyrics sound amazing, and this is my third favorite song on the CD.    9) Gonna Leave You (9/10): This song sounds a lot like \\"Go With The Flow,\\" except Nick Oliveri is on vocals. However, there are some great guitars and drumming, and this is still a very decent song. It's a little too short though.    10) Do It Again (10/10): The amazing guitar riff will blow you away, and the vocals are superb. I especially like the 2 minute and 15 second mark where the guitar riff changes. The chorus is pretty good, and this song is very catchy. Unfortuantely, the last minute and ten seconds is another one of those annoying radio interludes, and it gets pretty old after a while. The song itself is only 2:54, but that stupid interlude stretches it to 4:04. However, the part that actually is music is great.    11) Another Love Song (7/10): I never really liked this song very much. Nick Oliveri is on vocals, but other than that, nothing stands out on this song. It's pretty pointless and rather boring, but the interesting sound of the guitars helps it out a little.    12) God Is In The Radio (7/10): The great drumming and the fact that Mark Lanegan is on vocals make this song seem better than it truly is. Other than that it sounds pretty much the same throughout, and, as with \\"Another Love Song,\\" there's no real high point to this song. The fade out in the middle is pretty pointless, and just lets this song go on longer than should have been allowed. It really starts to drag towards the end.    13) Song For The Deaf (10/10): This song starts out with just the bass playing, followed by impressive guitar riffs, drumming, and vocals. The chorus is great, although it takes some of the dreepiness away from the general mood of the song. There's a really scary feel to this song, given to it mostly by Josh Homme's vocals, which sound creepy and hollow. All in all a good song, and one that you won't want to end.    14) Mosquito Song (10/10): This song is surprisingly good. It reminds me of \\"Lightning Song\\" from Rated R, because both are acoustic. Although this fact may make it seem like this song shouldn't be on a hard rock album, you'll be surprised at how well it fits in. The lyrics are very eerie, and though this song sounds pretty happy and bright, it's actually very disturbing if you listen closely. There's some amazing instrument playing here, including what seems to be an entire orchestra towards the end. This songs creepy quality makes it go along well with the preceeding track, \\"Song For The Deaf.\\" It's a great closer to a great album.    OVERALL: 124/140, 88.6%    Although not as good as the self-titled debut, Songs For Deaf is still a step up from Rated R. There are a few tracks on here that really hurt it, like \\"Six Shooter\\" and \\"Another Love Song,\\" but overall it's still an incredible rock album. If you consider yourself a fan of Queens of the Stone Age or just rock music in general, you should go out and buy this CD.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Take Me Away: 5/5 The whole song is awesome. Probably my third favorite.  <br /> <br />Together: 5/5 I'm attracted to the chorus.  <br /> <br />Don't Tell Me: 3/5 I listened to it way too often so now I don't like it as much. :( I like the message of the song, though. (Don't have sex with guys who only wanted you for sex.)  <br /> <br />He Wasn't: 5/5 Best Song on the C.D. <br /> <br />How Does It Feel: 3/5 I don't like the beginning too much, but it gets better.  <br /> <br />My Happy Ending: 5/5 This is my favorite song throughout the albums even before the MTV started showing it. (No, I'm really not an MTV addict.) I can relate with it very well right now. I kind of hate the way they changed the s word to &#34;stuff,&#34; cause it really changes the meaning, but I guess kids can't sing it if it stayed original.  <br /> <br />Nobody's Home: 4/5  <br /> <br />Forgotten: 4/5 I love the guitar.  <br /> <br />Who Knows: 4/5 Strangely, the chorus is the worst part of the song.  <br /> <br />Fall to Pieces: 5/5 This is my second favorite song in this album. A little bit out of character, though. (&#34;I just wanna cry in front of you.&#34; &#60;why would Avril cry in front of a guy??&#62;)  <br /> <br />Freak Out: 5/5 Love the message!  <br /> <br />Slipping Away: 5/5 I can't relate to the song, but I love the chorus.  <br /> <br />Conclusion: This album is totally different from Avril's previous album. I miss her lighter and catchier songs, but these songs are great, too, in their own way. That being said, Avril has definitely lost her trademark. <br /> <br />
B0001XAPX8|2.0|Since this film has so many problems... lets have some fun with it, shall we? I look at this list and I wish I were actually 'kidding'. <br /> <br />1. Anthony Hopkins... is black? <br /> <br />2. Anthony Hopkins looks like a totally different person when he was 'young'? <br /> <br />3. Anthony Hopkins cares about getting notes denouncing his activities with a younger woman... from a college he no longer works for? <br /> <br />4. Anthony Hopkins is having an 'affair' with the Nicole Kidman character? Really? His wife is dead, she's divorced... where's the affair? <br /> <br />5. Anthony Hopkins only friend in the world is some writer he burst in on in his cabin to write a book called 'Spooks'? <br /> <br /> <br />All of these questions are actually descriptive of what you'll find in The Human Stain. The saddest part of this list is, I only watched about 61 mintues of this movie, which was all I could stand. I think I stopped watching when I discovered Hopkins was black, or was it during the arguement over his 'affair'? I kept wondering what could come next? We discover Nicole Kidman isn't really a woman? Honestly, everything about it is grating and very little works. Kidman is fine, but that's almost too bad cause it's a wasted performance. My fave actor in the world is Anthony Hopkins and while he does have a poor movie once in awhile (SEE: INSTINCT) this one is beyond bad, IMO. Thank goodness it was a gift and I didn't waste my money on it... which I came so close to doing. And why is this film generally ten bucks more than any others? If anything it should ten dollars LESS.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped Part 1 - This track is as short as it is amazing. Christina's firing back at all of her critics with true evil and carelessness. She could care less what they think about this interlude. She is talking about how everyone tries to defy her uniqueness and talent by criticizing her harshly. The line, \\"Sorry you can't defy me,\\" has a hidden message to it. To me, it means, \\"You can't change me by saying horrible things about me because you don't like my repertoire and my style, so if that's what you're trying to do, you're failing!\\" big laugh. \\"You are trying to defy me, but you can't.\\" <br /> <br />2) Can't Hold Us Down - this song talks harshly about the double-standards of society when it comes to the sexuality of human men and women, and how men are glorified for sleeping with several women simultaneously and women are judged and considered whores if they do it, too, and how unfair she and Li'l Kim feel that this is.  <br /> <br />3) Walk Away - this song talks graphically on a casual relationship that was formed for fun, just like a \\"Get Mine Get Yours\\" kind of relationship, but when she fell in love with this sicko, it all went wrong and turned from fun to despicably horrible. <br /> <br />4) Fighter - Christina firing back at her ex. She's very angry. <br /> <br />5) Primer Amor Interlude - Christina, it's nice for you to do this in Spanish, but why didn't you re-release this track in Spanish and then record this in the beginning of it? Latinos understand what you're saying, but most Anglo-Saxons don't. <br /> <br />6) Infatuation - Great song. I have listened to it about 5,000 times since I got the CD.  <br /> <br />7) Loving Embrace Interlude - Two words... how sweet! <br /> <br />8) Loving Me 4 Me - Christina, you are soooooooo lucky! I wish I had a man that would love me for me no matter what. <br /> <br />9) Impossible - Chrissy, I feel your pain. I'm desperately in love with a man that's impposible to love. I've tried proving my love to him a million ways but he doesn't seem to care--what a fool I am! <br /> <br />10) Underappreciated - Great song, but I thank God that I haven't been through this. <br /> <br />11) Beautiful - Thank you, Christina! I used to think I was ugly and this song made me feel Beautiful! <br /> <br />12) Make Over - 'xtina_beautiful' - 'I don't need nobody tryin' to make me over' so don't waste your time tryin' sweetheart. Yeah, yeah, go to Xposed and cry your pain to everyone. You've put this upon yourself by fighting me in the boards. See if they'll listen. Yawn. <br /> <br />13) Cruz - beautiful. I used to not like it but now I do, because of the lyrics. <br /> <br />14) Soar - yes, Chris, I have soared and it feels so good!  <br /> <br />15) Get Mine, Get Yours - Great song, great beat, but I couldn't disagree more with the message it brings to all of your hardcore fans, Xtina. <br /> <br />16) Dirrty - how dirrtier can I be? Great song! I listen to it like it's just been released! <br /> <br />17) Stripped Part 2 - Great... whatever it's called, but I differ on one of those declarations verily. You guys figure it out. I won't explain myself here. <br /> <br />18) The Voice Within - I listen to the voice within me every time I start to cry desperately and it heals my pain. Thanks, Christina. <br /> <br />19) I'm ok - I am too, Christina. Word. Props. <br /> <br />20) Keep on singin' my song - yes, please do! The world would be empty without your song. There would be no point in listening to this music genre you guys convey. <br /> <br /> <br />
0790731479|5.0|This has been my favorite movie since I was a little kid. I used to watch it every day! It has perfect casting. This movie has a little of everything-comedy, drama, horror(well sorta). <br />Definitly a must see! <br /> <br />~silence~

B0001ZMWQO|3.0|I obviously bought this cd because of the first single, \\"Take me Out\\". To me, that is the best song on the album. The first time I listened to it I couldn't make it all the way through the cd without turning it off. I later gave it another try. I can't say I love it, but it is not bad. The bad thing is, sometimes it is hard to tell one song apart from the other. They all seem to have the same type of vibe to it. <br />Overall I would say, try and listen to the album before buying it.
B0000AM6JI|5.0|Anyone who doesn't understand why this movie is TOTALLY AWESOME needs to watch it a few more times! You need to put yourself into \\"CARLITO'S shoes\\" to understand the meaning & all the dialogue of the characters surrounding him. & when you do, it's actually a pretty funny movie too.  <br />Great characters.....Carlito (Pacino) of course, Davey Kleinfeld-Sean Penn is totally amazing, DA Norwalk-James Rebhorn, Turncoat Pachanga-Luiz Guzman, even the small roles are good- Lalin-Viggo Mortenssen, Benny Blanco-John Leguizamo, Saso-Jorge Porcel, just to mention a few.....& remember Rolando (Carlito's old dealer partner) he was Hector the TOAD in Scarface! It's funny how certain directors always have loyalty to actors of their past films, which is good! <br />But to keep this short, the story was very good too....moral of the movie is I guess is \\"the more someone tries to change, the more, they stay the same\\" But Carlito, really did tried.....but just couldn't escape the past.....In the end, his girl friend, Gail-Penelope Anne-Miller was right...... <br />
B00006ADD5|5.0|*****5 stars for the film    Sherif Ali : \\"There is the railway. And that is the desert. From here until we reach the other side, no water but what we carry with us. For the camels, no water at all. If the camels die, we die. And in twenty days they will start to die.\\"     T.E. Lawrence : \\"There's no time to waste, then, is there?\\"      During World War I, a flamboyant and intellectual British officer named T(homas) E(dward) Lawrence embarked on a journey to the Arab prince Feisal (later King Feisal I of Iraq) in the Hejaz (present-day Saudi Arabia), where he would eventually unite warring Arab tribes against the Turks, blow up railroad lines, and rewrite the political history of the Middle East.    Sir David Lean (The Bridge on the River Kwai) undertook the enormous task of adapting Lawrence's life to film. The result is an epic adventure with both action and intelligence, for which Lean earned his second Oscar for Best Director. The film boasts stunning cinematography and a crisp, thoughtful script full of memorable lines, which range from the dramatic thunderclap quoted above to the humorous:    General Murray : \\"I can't make out whether you're a bloody madman or just half-witted.\\"   Lawrence : \\"I have the same problem, sir.\\"    Omar Sharif plays Sherif Ali, whose intelligence, practicality and casualness toward human life play perfectly off of Lawrence's (Peter O'Toole's) own ideas about the value of life and his at times larger-than-life ego. Supporting roles are nailed by Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Claude Rains & others.     But without a doubt, the key here is the title character.    Lawrence was intelligent, witty, and conflicted; somehow O'Toole, with burning blue eyes, deftness, and nary a hint of strain, manages to capture this very complex man as he endures the most powerful and primal of experiences and emotions. Faced with things that under normal circumstances would be unfathomable, his feelings range from a sense of god-like self-assurance to recklessness to the very depths of human anguish and fatigue.     T.E. Lawrence : \\"I pray that I may never see the desert again. Hear me, God.\\"    Viewers, however, may well wish to see it over and over again through his eyes.    ***3 stars for this *single-disc* DVD edition    Picture quality is very good. Sound quality is okay; not perfect, but it shouldn't detract from your viewing experience.    Subtitled in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean & Thai.    Just don't expect to find any extras here - there's not even a trailer! If you don't care about special features, that's okay, but if you value them, do yourself a favor and buy the other (*2-disc*) edition. I wish I had!
B00005JNEI|2.0|Michael Moore has elevated himself to the league of rarified propagandists, most notably Leni Riefenstahl (who tried to convince us that Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party were the good guys). Moore has no use for the truth. He cobbles together unrelated sound bites to \\"prove\\" his viewpoint. Like most rich liberals, he doesn't allow the facts to interfere with his perceptions. In short, don't waste your time with this film.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Hey! I just saw the show in NY. It was Amazing!!! It delivers in every area. It was funny, sad, uplifting, actionpacked, and overall a huge production.  The sets, choragraphy were awsome. All the special effects were supurb. After every song the audenice was on thier feet cheering madly. The score was cathchy and told the story very well. I give this five stars and I would give it more!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|In the year of 2003 Britney returned to the music scene from her wild year of antics with the infamous MTV kiss with Madonna. In November 2003 Britney released her stunning Cd 'In The Zone'. Britney released her best album yet. She transformed herself from a sexy young teenager to a provocative young woman. In the Zone takes listeners though a journey of different styles of music. From Hard hitting dance tracks, to dirty ghetto Hip Hop to viby trance tracks to beautiful peaceful ballads. This album shows Britney at her best. This album made critics label her \\"The New Madonna\\". <br />Me Against The Music - This is the lead single from the album. It is the infamous duet featuring Madonna. It is a hard hitting club dance track, very different from what is on the radios these days. The track is just about being in a club and being oblivious to everyone and freestyling. This is my 2nd Favourite track on the album and one of my favourite songs of all time. 10/10 <br /> <br />(I Got That) Boom Boom - This track is an Up-tempo Hip Hop track perfect for the clubs. The track has also has an Indian vibe to it. This track features the Ying Yang Twins, which gives the track a dirty ghetto, feel to it. This song is my 3rd Favourite song on the album, and is one of the best Hip Hop songs I have ever heard. 10/10 <br /> <br />Showdown - The famous UK producers Bloodshy & Avant produced this track. It is a great sexy dance track which features Britney whispering \\"I don't wanna be a tease. Would you undo my zipper please\\" This track is done very well. Again very unique. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Breathe On Me - This song is very club-savvy orientated and is one of the most sensual tracks on the album. The song has a HOT beat and is reminiscent to Kylie's Can't Get You Out Of My Head. This track describes the intensity of a relationship so hot that they don't even need to touch, just breathe. This is my Favourite track on the album and one of my favourite songs of all time. I can automatically see this song go #1 if it is released. 10/10 <br /> <br />Early Mornin - The second this track commences you will automatically know that it is Moby produced. This track is very sexy and has a trance feel to it. The song is very vibey and is about the next morning after a big night out. 7/10 <br /> <br />Toxic - This is the second single from the album which is produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The song is HOT and fits Britney perfectly. The track is a hard hitting dance track which could easily be used as the theme song to Alias or the next bond movie. Critics are describing it the best song Britney has released since I'm A Slave For You. I love this track so much because of its uniqueness. 10/10 <br /> <br />Outrageous - This is a typical R&B penned track. The second the song commences you will automatically realise it is R Kelly produced. This song is again perfect for the clubs and has an Indian vibe to it. The chorus is very catchy. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Touch Of My Hard -This is the most sensual song on the album. This song is a beautiful dance ballad reminiscent to Madonna's The Power Of Goodbye. This song is an ode to self-love. Although this song is not dirty at all, it is Britney's most mature song to date and has a sexy vibe to it. This is definitely a stand out track on the album. 10/10. <br /> <br />The Hook-Up - Redzone, the famous team behind the Britney/Madonna duet, produced this track. This song has an R&B reggae feel to it and is fairly uptempo. This track takes some getting used to but when your hooked your definelty hooked. 9/10 <br /> <br />Shadow - This track is a beautiful ballad produced by The Matrix. This is very reminiscent to Avril's I'm With You. This track shows Britney's vocals at its best. 9/10 <br /> <br />Brave New Girl - reminds me of her earlier stuff, Lucky in particular 10/10 <br /> <br />Every Time - This track is absolutely stunning. Britney shines in this tale of heartbreak. This is definitely one of the most beautiful balladsever written by not only Britney herself but of all time. The simple harmony makes you feel the words and the pain Britney has felt. This is a Guy Sigsworth produced ballad. 10/10 <br /> <br />Me Against The Music (Remix) - This is remix to the First Single. The song was remixed by Peter Rishi and an Indian vibe has been added to it. The song is still very clubby and is probably one of the best remixes I have ever heard. 10/10 <br /> <br />ALL IN ALL I LOVE THIS CD AND I DON'T THINK IT COULD HAVE GOTTEN ANY BETTER. THIS ALBUM IS VERY UNQIUE AND IS BRITNEY'S BEST ALBUM SO FAR. OVERALL I GIVE IT A 10/10 <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006F83Y|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age is without a doubt one of the best rock bands out there today, but although this is a good album, and certainly better than all the \\"nu metal\\" garbage out there, it's lack of variety in song styles hurts it overall. <br /> <br />That's not to say it isn't worth purchasing. \\"Millionare\\", \\"No One Knows\\", \\"The Sky is Falling\\", \\"Do It Again\\", and especially \\"Mosquito Song\\" are all excellent rock songs with rock solid musicianship. The second half of the disc, however, kind of bleeds together (minus the aforementioned \\"Do It Again\\") into one long song comprised of a few hooks that aren't really worth listening to more than a few times. <br /> <br />So, while I would say this disc is worth a purchase, I would recommend that you get either of their previous outings (the self-titled album and \\"Rated R\\") before purchasing this one.
B00005JMXX|3.0|When I saw trailers for the movie, my first reaction was to pass on it.  It looked like every other disaster movie that was made.  When \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" came to our \\"cheap\\" theatre, my partner and I decided to take advantage of $1.50 night and go see this movie.  After all, it would be cheaper than renting the movie.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed \\"Day After\\".  The plot is predictable, and one of my initial thoughts while watching the moive was \\"Hey, they should call this Deep Impact 2: Deep Freeze\\", but after a short while, I warmed up to the movie, and I did enjoy myself.  Its good entertainment, well worth at least one viewing, but as far as owning the movie, I'll probably pass on that.  If you're looking for something stellar and groundbreaking and Oscar worthy, don't bother.  If you are looking to be entertained for two hours, then watch it.  But this is an instance where I would caution a \\"rent before buying\\".
B0000X61UU|5.0|Cindy Crawford's The Next Challenge is amazing.  I was a Junior in college when I became engaged and had to loose my \\"Freshmen 15\\" in order to feel like a princess at my wedding.  This workout changed my lifestyle and helped me feel my best for my big day.  The way she mixes cardo with leg toning, arm strength and abs, chest exercises and more abs creates a full body workout that leaves you breathless but statisfied.  The Next Challege has changed my perspective on staying fit, I will swear by it to anyone.
1592400876|1.0|I may have to take a look at it next time I find myself at the bookstore. I'd been interested in this title since the first time I heard it discussed on CNN, I believe it was. I've seen it once or twice at the local bookstore and picked it up once, but didn't get a chance to read through it and I didn't buy it. After reading this, [...]  I'm not sure I want to spend my money on it. I'm one of those people who can't not see spelling, punctuation and grammar mistakes, but I don't think referring to a 14-year-old girl as a \\"vapid mousey moron\\" (and shouldn't there be a comma in there?) is the way to get people to see the light. She's only preaching to the choir here. The people who really need help aren't going to go to someone who gets off on insulting children.
B00005JNEI|5.0|There is little doubt about Mike Moore's ability to arouse passions.  He achieved this end with \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" and his recent publications.  He has managed to keep the flames burning with \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\".  In so doing, he has earned the ire of America's right.<br /><br />Moore has a wonderful discursive style of documentary making where seemingly complex issues are reduced to their basic building blocks.  Other documentary makers could do worse than emulate Moore's style.  However, there are undoubtedly occasions when he oversteps the mark.  For example, he gives the impression that America's Oregon coast is guarded by one state trooper.  This is clearly absurd but an impression is, nonetheless, passed off as fact.  Moore should take care with all his facts.<br /><br />It is now widely understood that there is no real connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam's regime in Iraq.  George Bush and his supporters will, in due course, face the wrath of the electorate.  Moore simply points out facts that some choose to ignore.  This is democracy working in spite of the efforts of Messrs Bush, Blair and co.<br /><br />It is not clear how the mess in Iraq will be resolved.  With the benefit of hindsight, it is a mess made worse by the West.  Moore shows that the emperor has no clothes.
B00005JMUA|5.0|In volume I, we saw a lot of violence and a lot of revenge being exacted.  In volume II, we find out what happened in the life of the Bride to cause her old associates to try to kill her. We learn about her training.  We see a whole lot more character development than there was time for in Kill Bill, Vol. 1.  <br />This is a great movie.  It's not quite as comic book-y as the first movie (but there are still huge elements of comic book), and there is much less spurting blood.  Darryl Hannah's role is so good for her. How evil! <br />Madsen is just a great actor and what a great character (with depth, depth, depth) he gets to play this time.  \\"That woman deserves her revenge and we deserve to die.\\"  What a great line.  His acting should shame other actors. <br /> <br />This is the part of the movie that should quell all those who thought the characters were a bit shallow.  Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is a great flick.   <br />I enjoyed this movie.  My husband enjoyed this movie. I think you'll like it, too. <br />The DVD extras are nice in that there's a bit on each character and the actor who played her/him. There's a deleted scene with a nicely choreographed fight. <br />All in all, I would recommend this movie. <br />
B00008S2VG|1.0|Look, i love Madonna, but this is ridiculous.. Madonna $^@@#& it up once again, why didnt she rethink it all with Music? American life is crap for people with no life, as it is a very depressing album that is very dark and gloomy, at least Marilyn Manson can pull it off to look good, she makes a mockery of it. The only good track on it is Die another day, and that isnt morbidly depressing at all. WHERE's the Dance Madonna we loved way back when?WHERE OH WHERE? <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|Well what can I say Except PLEASE if you are going to be disrespectful to our president at least you could try to be accurate.I have a thought since Michael Moore is so unhappy here He should go live in Iraq or Iran and how about this since you think that this war is so unnessary why don't you donate all the BLOOD money your making off of this \\"film \\"and as use that term losely to all the families and solders.I am shocked at the disrespect you Mr Moore show to america as a whole.
B00005JNEI|4.0|All the reviews I've read here obviously are along party lines.  I'm absolutely sure that the \\"reviewers\\" here are not criticing the film as art but as political propaganda.  It is rather obvious that those that say it is trash, have a political agenda and those who praise it to the sky have one too. <br /> <br />There's no doubt that Moore despises the Bush administration, and he would say he has reason to do so.  Many of the visual representations in the film are biased and distorted.  There are, however, powerful images in the film.  Bush's 7 minutes, The Saudi-Bin Laden connection to the Bush family and the greed exemplified at the fundraiser.  There are also some slanted scenes, such as following a proud Flint housewife whose son goes into the military, and dies, and whose conversion to anti-Bush after the death is predictable. <br /> <br />Personally I had no problems with Bush until Iraq.  I supported his Patriotic enthusiasm to destroy those that attacked us.  I was all for the Afghanistan invasion.  It was clear that that country had harbored and trained Al Queda and that Bin Laden was there.  Any undertones or connections with Bin Laden by Bush were not evident to me.  Then came Iraq - and the rush to war and my opinions of the Bush administration changed dramatically. <br /> <br />So, like everyone else, I went to see 9/11 with pre-conceptions. <br /> <br />As a film, I felt that Fahrenheit 9/11 was a bit long, sometimes predictable (based on Moore's bias) and even often overdone. <br /> <br />I was shocked, to some extent, to see the heated discussions in Congress about the Florida voter count.  I was unaware of that. <br /> <br />But, this film has lasting images which might aid in turning this election.  There are moments when visual evidence of our President's greed, indecision, and single-mindedness cannot be denied. <br /> <br />I agree that the film is NOT a documentary, it IS propoganda.  But it does show clearly that Bush was determined to get rid of Saddam at all costs, and perhaps, just perhaps, OIL was at the root of invasion of Iraq.  If Moore is correct, what Bush has done will go down in history as a invasion of a sovereign state for no other reason than he personally hated Saddam, though a tyrant and a despot, who was incapable of injuring the USA.  This is something that no other President in the history of this country has ever done. <br /> <br />However, if Moore is incorrect, then he has done a disservice to a President that has simply waged a war on terrorists who attacked us without provocation. <br /> <br />When you think about it, based upon what we all know now, don't you have to say - NAH?
B000000OAL|5.0|This album has to be one of the best albums in Rock. It's not POPped out with lush extravagance. They do that great on Queen and Queen II. Raw extravagance is I guess what it can be called. Brian May plays the guitar like an affecianado. One of the Best Guitarists ever. Keep Yourself Alive is the mould and benchmark for all glam bands to try and copy, except Queen is pure hard rock to where the others aren't. Every song from beginning to end has a great tune. Doing Alright is the best non-pop great song of all time. It's better than POP. Jesus is very wise and a great tune, pretty inspirational. So is Liar. What a great concept these guys had on this album. Truth set against how people bend the truth for their own purposes. This is expressed as a real rocker in Great King Rat and My Fairy King. These songs are emotional and inspirational. This shows their raw genius.
B00003CWN2|5.0|I work in a video store so, I managed to walk right pass this movie quite a few times before I actually got the nerve to watch it. However, I'm glad I did because this was the most disturbing movie that I have ever seen. I had heard the story, but hearing about it, and actually watching it is totally different because you get to see the events that occurred for yourself. I couldn't imagine something that inhumane happening to a human being at the hands of another, and that's what made me cry like a baby. No human being deserves to be raped, beaten, humiliated, and degraded just because they aren't what you thought they were. True enough, Brandon wasn't honest from the beginning, but that just doesn't justify what happened to him in no shape, form, or fashion. I had only one question at the end of this movie...What makes people so hateful? Also, what I found upsetting was that the actual assailants didn't even have anything to do with the situation at hand. If anybody had a right to be angry it was Lana, and if she accepted Brandon for who he really was then none of this should've even happened. I definitely see Hilary Swank in a new light now. Before this movie I only thought that she was mediocre at best, but she was absolutely amazing. I give her nothing but the highest R.E.S.P.E.C.T from now on.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Some of this is Michael Moores slant on things. Those parts are pretty obvious. <br />Some things you cannot fake. One of these is the expression on George Bushs face and his reaction when he is told America is under attack. <br />If you only see this short part of the movie you have your moneys worth.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Ok first BRAVO to Mel Gibson for standing up to show the world that he does believe in Jesus.I saw the film and I was so moved by what I saw that I cried.In a world where we have become unable to express a real emotion that is not dictated by others I truly am glad to see a real film that has nothing to do with the all powerful dollar.I agree with those who can see that this film is about much more than what a certain group did to our Lord.Rather it is about what we as a people did.And for those who say it was to violent,well just look around at the games your children play or the movies we as caring sensitive humans watch.These are the real things we should be concerned about.If you take anything from this film take a new understanding that it is time to stop all the hate in our society.Thank you Mr.Gibson for giving us a truly great gift.
B000003CMB|5.0|If they ever invent a time machine, I'm going to this concert.
B00004SVID|5.0|This is an amazing live cd. The booklets inside tell so much as to how the band preformed the wall live. All the band memebers shine amazing at so many points I can't name them all. The intro to \\"run like hell\\" is brillent. I will admit that the singing on some tracks like \\"In the flesh\\" and \\"the happiest days of our lives\\" aren't quite as good as the studio. A couple days after I got the wall live i listened to the studio to compare. I actually found myself board with the studio.
B000286RJI|2.0|Kill Bill Volume 1 was dangerous, but they dropped the ball with Volume 2 because this movie sucked @ss. The first Kill Bill started out with revenge and action from start to finish, but instead of them finishing what they started with the Volume 1, they decided to take it back to the beginning to show us where she (Uma Thurman) learned all this stuff from. I think that's what slowed this movie down in my opinion. I expected to see \\"The Bride\\" get down and dirty this time around with Elle and Bud however, I was very disappointed though. Elle eliminated Bud with a deadly snake before Beatrix even got a chance to kill him, and when she did show up to the party she didn't even kill Elle like I thought she would. I was like WOW! she snatched out her other eye, and left her kicking and screaming in the bathroom. I was looking foward to seeing her wreck shop like she started off with the first two assasins and their minions in Volume 1 no questions asked, but I was utterly disappointed. I'm glad that I work in a video store so I got to see it for free because if I had spent any money to watch this movie, I would have demanded a refund.
0156027321|5.0|The end is so heartbreaking. I dont know if it makes you believe in God or the endurence of the human spirt. Just wonderful.
B000001Y79|5.0|Here is the album which but the California rock/ska band No Doubt into the starlight. Not only is this CD the band's breakthrough album, but their third record. With the notorious drummer Adrian, the incredibly guitarist Tom, along with the heart-breaker Tony, and finally the beautiful and talented Gwen Stefani, the band is one of the best to ever be formed. With singles like, Spiderwebs, Excuse Me Mr., Just A Girl, Sunday Morning, and Don't Speak, it is easy to hear why the band had trouble in the business for their first three years, but also why they finally hit it big in 1995. And along with the hits that were unplayed by the radio and television such as, Sixteen, World Go 'Round, and the track their record is titled after, Tragic Kingdom, it will get you hooked on all of their past and future releases. Crank your player up and enjoy!
1573301183|5.0|WOW !!!! AMAZING !!!  Highly, Highly, Highly, HIGHLY Recommended.  This DVD is a MUST for AiC fans.  Layne's voice is strong and vibrant even though his health was very obviously on the decline.  This MTV Unplugged is a great reminder of what an AMAZING and truly TALENTED band AiC was...There are NO bands that will EVER capture the raw emotion that AiC was capable of and there are NO vocalists that will EVER compare to Layne Staley...these facts are Clearly evident in this show.  WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!
B000060OFT|5.0|This is the most beautiful love film I have ever seen.  If you like films that give you the feeling of love inside you, this is one you have to watch!  Leonardo DiCaprio is a perfect Romeo and Claire Danes is a beautiful Juliet.  This is one of those movies that will always be in my heart.  Also the music is beautiful! It gives the extra Love to the film.    Great acting, beautiful lovescenes (The poolscene/ aka the balkony scene), great music,  perfect emotion (For example, when Romeo kills Tybalt and when the lovers die)   The ending is sad, but very very beautiful.   When the ending is happening before your eyes you think: Oh my God, What a sad ending. But when the credits roll over the screen you think: This is one beautiful movie.   (When I finised watching the movie I just wanted to talk like they do in the movie, that's how obsessed you can get with this)  Before I saw the ending for the first time, I thought it would be just like all the other Romeo and Juliet movies (Romeo dies, Juliet wakes up) But here it's different, what powers the emotion and let's you understand what the power of love can do to people.     The Ultimate Romeo + Juliet movie for me.
B0000VD04M|5.0|A few years ago, this title was announced for release on DVD.  It didn't happen.  I Added my desire for it on Amazon's \\"Wish List.\\"  When it was released, I received my copy almost immediately.  No \\"Glitches\\" or problems of any kind...in fact, the BW transfer on my HDTV is breathtaking.  For true film buffs the \\"Extras\\" are beyond belief.  Why it was recalled is a mystery to me.  Lets hope that this new release lives up to the first one.  I can't access the \\"Easter Egg\\" but with this disc's \\"Extras,\\" it aint'all that important.
B00005JXY3|5.0|I should be considered an expert on this film but I'm not going to claim it.  Right now I'm in Kyoto Japan and I am Japanese-American.  So this movie has a very special meaning to me.  I saw it when I was very little and loved every minute of it.  I was always asking my mom if certain things were correct or if the Japanese was correct. <br />Albeit now the Japanese Slang is a bit old and the issues are a bit ancient (not to also mention most of the movie was filmed in Pat Morita's home state of Hawaii).  This movie still speaks to me.  <br />I like it better than the first and truthfully I think whether it's better or not is just a state of opinion not actual quality.  I just think the second one speaks to me more than the first.  I wasn't the skinny outcast being picked on in high school.   <br />However, I recommend seeing both the first and second not only because of the messages relayed within about honor, respect, love, and the bond between an aged fisherman and a kid from New Jersey, but also because these movies have some of the greatest one liners ever!   <br />\\"Daniel-san nobody perfect.\\" <br />Check them out and see what I mean.  Relive the 80's and come back to the depressing reality TV era.   <br />BTW  I'm reviewing the Japanese DVD.  They just remade all the movies here on DVD for about $15 each.  So I'm picking these up.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has managed to create something unexplainably brilliant with his duo of films, \\"Kill Bill.\\" Only Tarantino could have pulled these films off. Part one is the Eastern version with a huge emphasis placed on the physical aspect of the characters. <br /> <br />In KB Pt. 1 we meet \\"The Bride\\" played fantastically by Uma Thurman. The opening scene is gruesome and starts this film off on a path that others would have totally butchered. Part one is graphic and brutal in some scenes so be prepared, blood flows in buckets here! Thurman is a trained assassin who discovers that she is pregnant and decides to retire, an easy decision but it makes a mountain from a mole hill. Thurman spends the rest of the film seeking revenge for the wrongs she suffers and she does it brilliantly. \\"The Bride\\" aka \\"Black Mamba\\" aka Thurman uses the finesse and artistic beauty of Kung Fu and other martial arts to reek havoc on her prey. The fight scenes with Lucy Liu are cinematically beautiful and the group fight is perfectly choreographed. Thurman outdoes herself! <br /> <br />Starring with Uma Thurman is a cast of characters played by, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, Julie Dreyfus, and many stars from the real Kung Fu genre. Tarantino managed to cast his characters perfectly and has created some very interesting foes for Thurman to avenge herself against. The film is told in chapters with each arch enemy dealt with in a great short story. Tarantino shoots with fantastic colors and unique lighting so that each frame is something stunning to behold. He takes a fun stab at Kung Fu films from China, the old spaghetti Westerns from Italy and even a few horror scenes straight out of De Palma's generation. Tarantino winds his way through this film making many little pictures that mesh into one, he has become a master at directing this type of picture and manages to hold the interest of his audiences the entire way. <br /> <br />\\"Kill Bill\\" Pt. 1 may not appealto all people although it is a journey highly recommended for its utter uniqueness, beautiful scenes and great music matched perfectly to the background stories. It is bloody and brutal but in some strange way entirely necessary and not out of context. Between all of the sword fights, Kung Fu kicks and fatal injuries the story is really good. \\"The Bride\\" is relatable and you will root for Thurman and her stoic vulnerability until the very end. All I can say is Wow! <br />
B00005NG9Z|5.0|Highly, Highly, HIGHLY recommended .... If you are an AiC fan then this is a MUST own...Completely and Totally worth every penny...With the included \\"home video\\" clips this compilation takes you \\"behind the scenes\\" so to speak of one of the BEST BANDS OF ALL TIME...you get to see the \\"lighter side\\" of the band members and it makes you miss Layne even more than you already do if you're a TRUE AiC fan.  AMAZING !!!
B000054OTY|5.0|This is a great film with unusual visual and story elements. Brando is superb and Karl Malden possibly better in this fairly complex and character driven revenge western. Don't expect wall to wall action and shoot-outs because you will be disappointed. This is a thinking man's western with several themes explored through tremendous acting on the part of the cast. That being said about the film, let me just say that out of the seven to ten DVD versions available perhaps one or two are watchable. Why Paramount would not invest a little money into THE overlooked film of arguably our greatest American film actor is beyond me. Give the public a cleaned up print of this film and a little advertising based purely on Brando's reputation and they just might make some money off of it. As it stands the film will continue to be maligned and overlooked due to the atrocious DVD transfers that proliferate every video store and drugstore bargain bin. Good luck finding a good version. I watched it on the Diamond Entertainment version in letterbox and it was a fairly good transfer of an unrestored late 1961 film. It would be a wonderful thing to see this film restored with some of that lost million foot of footage Brando shot included in a DVD package. Ah but to dream. Brando deserves better.
0345347951|2.0|The future has infinite possabilities.  One could write about pretty much anything, from the end of the world to the joyful coming of alien oompa loompas to share in earth's next golden age.  Therefore, the value of a futuristic book such as Childhood's End should be based on the ultimate reason - the ideas and outcomes within.  Does the plot all add up like pieces of a puzzle, and does the final picture reflect meaningfully on all the pieces?  Does it end with an intelligent idea that justifies the book as a whole?        That being said and asked, I found this story to lack all-important cohesion.  Childhood's End jumps around from era to era, consistently pitting the reader with optimistic (and thus highly unlikely) summaries of boring human development and occasionally introducing another soon-to-disappear character.  Sub-plots vanish into thin air as time passes.  Most disappointingly, the outcome is so abstract and unlikely that it is wholly unsatisfying.  Without the author's consistent  reassurances that the final chapter is a blessing for the human race, the reader would be hard pressed not to believe that this was an inadvertent tale of lonliness and depression.  Although Clark tries to tie up all the minor puzzle pieces into one final picture, the picture itself is fairly absurd. Overall conclusion leads to much head scratching and bafflement - not so much as to what actually happened as why an author would take such a nonsensical route in the first place.        While this review is admittedly harsh, scrutany often comes with excessive hype and praise.  The story was indeed interesting at times, it lacked that spark of intelligence that is the life blood of a great science fiction novel. Childhoods end is short, easy and for the most part enjoyable.  However, after reading an odyssey of the mind such as Neuromancer, a true testimate to the limitless levels of a hypothetically realistic future, Childhood's end is childs play.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Quentin Tarantino expands his \\"Kill Bill\\" film with this movie KB Pt. II. This film answers all those questions that crept into your psyche during part one.<br /><br />While KB Pt. I was filled with unanswered questions, many fight scenes and brutal killings this film (Pt. II) is more on a psychological mission than a physical one. In a way this movie is the Western version of the East/West duo. The film still focuses upon the story of \\"The Bride\\" (Uma Thurman) and her revenge quest against those who wronged her. Most importantly in this film we finally get to meet Bill, played with interest by David Carradine. Together Thurman and Carradine take the audience on another uniquely original ride directed by Tarantino.<br /><br />KB Part II has less brutality and sadly less Kung Fu. But in this film we are able to understand the characters better and the tortures they are faced with are more psychological in origin. We meet \\"Bill,\\" and the man \\"The Bride\\" intended to marry, Daryl Hannah has a significant part in the saga, Michael Madsen provides some interesting sensitivity, and finally the Kung Fu master Pai Mei (played by Chia Hui Liu) makes his debut training Thurman on to brilliance. This film is done with many black & white scenes and old western type scenes, while the music in the background sounds a little like an old spaghetti western from Italy I once saw.<br /><br />This film is less intense than Part I but more grueling psychologically. One great fight scene is not to be missed between Thurman and Hannah of course! Tarantino manages to keep the viewers interested while creating a completely different movie from Part I, but watch them both and experience something unique and interesting, with stunning visuals and great music.
B000050FEN|5.0|This movie is by far the best of its genre. David Finchers best work. The movie has strong language and some disturbing and gruesome images, so granted this movie is not for children. The movie goes like this. Retiring Detective Summerset(Morgan Freeman) and new detective, David Mills(Brad Pitt) are assigned to solve these murders. Soon many murders are found and all have a clever connection to the seven deadly sins. Both detectives get involved in the insane killers plan. I wont spoil the rest, but the ending is genius. Se7en is brilliant, engrossing, clever, wonderful and disturbing. A true movie masterpiece. If you haven't seen it buy it now!
B00005JMX6|5.0|Well, I recently saw this romantic comedy and I totally loved it. It has just become my favourite. I mean, the story itself is great. A nerd falls in love with his neighbour and later, when they are already dating, finds out that she is a porn star. After some time of fighting, he decides that he'll save her from this porn world, because he is too in loved with her. Of course there are many really hilarious jokes in this movie. Believe me, there really isn't any lack of humour. But what makes this movie so great is the star of the movie ELISHA CUTHBERT. This girl is so great. And I don't mean just her beauty. It has to be sad, that this girl can really act. She is not like the other cute actresses, who usually don't have a clue about acting. She is awesome actress. I believe there is a great future in front of her. And beside this acting skills, she is also one of the cutest girls I have ever seen. She is a true dream girl. So, I definitely recommend this movie. Either because of the story or because of Elisha. It doesn't matter. You'll be satisfied both ways.
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd certainly has their share of good cds, this is one of them. A cd containing songs mixed together like they're only one song altogether. This applies to a lot of Pink Floyd cds. For instance, &quot;The Wall&quot; which was the last of dominating Pink Floyd cds over others, (also was a soundtrack to Pink Floyd's movie called &quot;The Wall&quot;). But unlike other Pink Floyd cds, this is an experimental cd, which means they experiment with different instruments and sound effects to make the cd sound unique then other albums out there in the market. Overall, this cd has a good intro and a good outtro.<BR>1. Speak to Me/Breathe - When you first start the record, it's dead quiet. Not a single sound is heard, then a heartbeat fades in, and as it gets louder and louder various sound effects are heard: people speaking, a ticking clock, a cashier machine, and a really creepy laugh. Next, a scream breaks all these sound effects, including the heartbeat, and it gets right into &quot;Breathe&quot;, which is a slow song, but very relaxing, with great lyrics. Roger Water's voice is very strong in this song, better than most songs. Although, it isn't one of the best songs on the cd, it still deserves a fair amount of credit to be on there.  [9.7/15]<BR>2. On The Run - The mixing tape keyboards are really interesting this song but doesn't make this song any better than it is. Possibly, the weakest songs on the cd. It is a fast song, with crazy keyboards and sound effects, including a person running and people talking. I think if this song was shorter, it would be very good, but it kind of drags on for too long. [7.0/15]<BR>3. Time - This song has a startling intro. Many clock bells ringing away, which makes it kind of annoying for the listener. Once it fades away, it's much more satisfying. This song has great lyrics. It also has a choir that sings with Roger Waters in this song. At the end of Time, for a short surprise is &quot;Breathe reprise&quot;, which makes the song even more better. This whole track altogether is one of the strongest songs on this cd. It really catches the audience's attention, and makes you want more. [11.5/15]<BR>4. The Great Gig In The Sky - An amazing song. A great intro which includes a soft tune played on the piano. Then, the drums kick in and the organ, and a long vocal solo by a woman named Clare Torry is heard. Such a powerful voice! I recommend this song for new Pink Floyd fans, because it is so well done. Not the best song on the cd, though. But it sure ranks up there with all the best Pink Floyd songs. [12.6/15]<BR>5. Money - I remember explaining about the cashier machine sound effects in the beginning. This the intro to the best song on the cd. These cashier machine noises are mixed together to create a beat. Then, while this is going on, a really cool bassline is heard, and the drums kicked in along with the guitars and organs. This song doesn't have really good lyrics, I should say, but it doesn't matter. The tune is catchy, so is Roger Waters's voice. This song contains a saxophone solo, and bonechilling guitar solo that can send shivers down your spine. I loved this song when I first heard it. Amazing, a true classic for sure. The most powerful song heard on the cd. [14.3/15]<BR>6. Us And Them - A slow song, but it catches your attention the smooth jazzy saxophone solo and a soft organ playing. Great lyrics. I think one of Roger Waters's best lyrics his written. This song drags on for a bit, but it's not that bad. I think it's the 3rd best song on the album. [12.2/15]<BR>7. Any Colour You Like - This is indeed another instrumental song. Good song. Not much to really say about it. [10.1/15]<BR>8. Brain Damage - This song and &quot;Eclipse&quot; are joined together, so it is all one big song. Really powerful lyrics and a great tune. One of Pink Floyd's best songs ever. The 2nd best song on the &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; album. A choir sings along again with Roger Waters. Both &quot;Brain Damage&quot; and &quot;Eclipse&quot; deserve a high rating. [13.9/15]<BR>This is a must buy album. And, if you are just getting into Pink Floyd, and you've only heard a few songs by them, this is a great cd to start off with. A great classic. One of the Best Albums I've Heard In A Very Long Time!
B0001XAPX8|2.0|I expected more from this film than it held. With the likes of Nicole Kidman, Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris and Gary Sinise cast in this novel adaptation how could it fail? <br /> <br />I understand that the novel written by Phillip Roth was difficult to adapt to the screen which may have led to the so-so effect of this film despite a brilliant cast. I found the film to be slow and straining to get through but good enough to watch. The story is very American centering on the acts of a man born as an African American but light skinned enough to pass for white. Because of the era that this character (Hopkins) grew up in his success or failure, sadly, could have been driven by the color of his skin so he chose to pretend to be white and disown his family instead. As a college dean many years later he makes a remark that is construed to be a racial slur and his life changes drastically. Following his wife's death and the loss of his position in life he begins an unlikely affair with an illiterate woman (Kidman) who is running from her own life in many ways. The characters are interesting and filled with depth but the film tends to show them in almost a shallow context. <br /> <br />Nicole Kidman is very good as the 34 year old illiterate woman who has an affair with Hopkins who is much older. She is vulnerable and secretive and on the run from her husband who is abusive and controlling. Kidman scores highly in many of the scenes exhibiting a great deal of emotional effort in this role. Anthony Hopkins is typically brilliant as the troubled man of questionable race. Through flashbacks we meet the younger man that Hopkins plays and are able to grasp why he chose to betray his race for success. Ed Harris is superb as the stalking ex-Vietnam vet husband of Kidman. Harris's character is eerily unstable and although he only appears in a few scenes he manages to steal them nonetheless. The stabling force in all of this character study is Gary Sinise who is a writer that befriendsHopkins and eventually pieces the entire story together. All of the actors are excellent but somehow the film just doesn't cut it and is a bit of a strain to get through surprisingly.  <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I was shaking in my seat.  Michael Moore knows how to get your attention.  Thank you Mr. Moore for waking up the American public.  I highly recommend this movie, especially for Bush supporters.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I rented the dvd from my library and it turns out that its the most dull movie of the year. Its an obvious fact that American Celebrities go overseas to do commercial work where the American public can't see them since A-listers consider doing commercials here tacky. Think Catherine Zeta-Jones in those t-mobil commercials.  <br /> <br />Bill Murray is a boring man in this movie, he plays a celebrity, basically he plays himself, and he's filming a whiskey commercial in Japan. Meanwhile a young American played by Scarlett Johansson must contend with learning how to deal when her photographer husband is busy with his job. These two characters come across each other one day and they manage to click. I didn't care enough to know what happened because I found it dull, and took out the dvd after an hour. This film moves really slow and its so boring.  <br /> <br />Bill Murray's character is a boring movie star, he doesn't have any friends and he doesn't know what to do with himself in Japan. Scarlett Johansson's character is weird as well, I didn't like her either, if it bothered her that her husband was such a workaholic then why didn't she talk to him? Instead she just lies back and goes off to do her own thing. I didn't believe that they were husband and wife. They acted more like two annoyed siblings. Skip this one.
B00005NB8K|5.0|The doors is a fantastic film about the great 60's rock band \\"the Doors\\" and front man Jim Morrison. This film talks about how the band got started and how it ended. Val Kilmer deserved an oscar out of this film. He looked, sounds, and acted like Jim Morrison. Oliver Stone made a perfect choice casting Val. I've never really heard any of the doors music, but this film (like sid and nancy) got me in to them. This film realy catches the scent of the 60's. Peace, love, naked, marijuana, and etc. This film can be depressing watching it but is realy amazing. It can be funny also at the same time, who knew Jim was funny.     The second disk includes a featurette, trailer-teaser-tv spots, deleted scenes, road to excess-a deep and dark look at the heart of the film, comentary, and much more. The only thing that disapointed me buy buying this film is that there are no subtitles. Some scenes are really hard to understand. Other than that you need to go pick up this dvd. You wont be disapointed except for the subtitle draw back.
B00008PX8P|5.0|OK, there ain't nobody who knows Le Zep like me, so sit back and be educated.  If you are interested in seeing this band kicking on all four cylinders, buy it and be done with it.  I'll cover the best reason to purchase this DVD:  the Knebworth set, 1979, the best live performance you'll ever see (on tape or DVD anyway) of this band.  Nice intro of \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" of us savages spending the night, etc. before the show.  Tame food fight compared to AC/DC at Donnington a couple years later, but respect for the Zep is in order.  A nice version of \\"Rock and Roll\\" kicks off the set--much better than the fake crap from MSG in the previous set (great music, but laid down over the video--fools only fools, shame!)  A fabulous version of \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" should get your JBLs nice and hot.  \\"Sick Again,\\" one of my favorite Zep tunes, makes you realize why this band was so special--they compliment each other SO VERY well.  Incredibly, the performances continue to get stronger with \\"Achilles Last Stand,\\" one of their favorite tunes, and it shows.  Here's where you realize that these guys are all hitting--I've never seen Plant do a bad show, but when Page is having fun, Plant will go to a different level and things get special.  Just when you think it can't get any better, \\"In the Evening\\" just knocks your socks off.  Jimmy Page hammers the tremolo on that ugly blue Strat better than anyone I've ever seen for a single performance, including Mr. Hendrix--VERY IMPRESSIVE folks.  My subwoofer couldn't hang and shut down to cool off.  Fortunately, the JBL L-100Ts never missed a beat.  My ears are still ringing and it feels soooo good.  \\"Kashmir\\" is, well, \\"Kashmir.\\"  One of the standards of our time and this live version beats all the other live versions I've seen them do.  I've never heard a Danelectro sound as good as Page made it sound--just plain incredible.  I won't spoil \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" for you, you get the picture.  BOTTOM LINE:  the Knebworth set is worth the price of the DVD--the rest is bonus.  Make yourself worthy and buy it.  If your stereo and speakers can't rattle the walls, buy some that will and engage this DVD--you won't be sorry. <br />Rapid Rick <br />
B0000057D8|5.0|The idea of a \\"perfect recording\\" is, of course, chimerical. But Trevor Pinnock's \\"Brandenburg Concertos\\" and \\"Orchestral Suites\\" come pretty close to the mark. There are two factors which put this 3-CD set in the category \\"very special\\": One is the sheer musicianship of the young English Concert team. Every soloist seems to want to outdo the others in technical skill, tonal clarity and emotional verve. Listen to Pinnock himself on the harpsichord in the Brandenburg Concert No. 5; listen to Lisa Beznosiuk accompanying him on the traverse flute; listen to Simon Standage, Philip Pickett and Rachel Beckett in Concert No. 4 ... and so the list goes on. This is an unending sequence of instrumental delights, and only someone who dislikes Baroque period instruments on principle will fail to experience heights of enjoyment of this exquisite sound. Which brings me to the second factor: Seldom have I heard such a brilliant recording! Deutsche Grammophon is generally known for superior sound, but this 1982 piece of digital engineering (Brandenburg Concertos) surpasses anything I have ever heard even from this label: Purity, clarity, spaciousness and presence are uniquely combined to provide a listening experience which could hardly be topped.<br /><br />The Orchestral Suite sound (analogue recording from 1979/1980) is only slightly less brilliant and also deserves great praise. I have listened to a number of rival recordings, but nothing captivates me quite like the the English Concert discs. The only slight question mark could perhaps be put behind the Sixth Brandenburg Concerto, which in its Adagio slow movement seems to lack a little fire. Generally, Pinnock has chosen tempi that are moderate, and although musicologists and interpreters since this recording (Goebel; Rampe) have argued cogently for faster rhythms, their efforts sound decidedly contrived in comparison with Pinnock's easy, flowing version which caresses the ear without betraying any of Bach's depth or humour. It would surprise me greatly if anyone who bought this CD-box ever regretted it.surprise me greatly if anyone who bought this CD-box ever regretted it.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I'm in my 20s and I like Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger but this movie was mostly disappointing. I saw Chicago at the theatres then I saw it on dvd and I still didn't like it. I like some of the songs and I like the musical number that they did at the end, but I just don't get what the big deal was. The critics made too much hype about Chicago. I think that most movies fail to bring the transition of Broadway to the movie screen.  <br /> <br />I love the classic musicals like \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" and \\"West Side Story.\\" I hope they *don't* remake those! I was also disappointed by the Moulin Rouge, it just didn't do it for me. Chicago is just another disappointment. The classic musicals are much more superior to today's. They just don't make them like they used to.  <br /> <br />I've never seen Chicago on Broadway, so maybe the theatre version is much better than the movie. I found this to be true when it came to Les Miserables. I loved the Broadway play and eventually saw Les Miserables on dvd with Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman and Claire Danes. I really liked the movie but the Broadway play is much better.  <br /> <br />I hope Phantom of the Opera is great, but who knows? At this point I'm trying not to get my hopes up. I don't get what the big deal was with this movie.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|INSTEAD OF WRITING A LONG ESSAY... I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT \\"IN THE ZONE\\" WAS HER BEST CD YET.. SHE HAS IMPROVED SOME MUCH AND SHE HAS GROWN AS AN ARTIST..

B000002UB3|5.0|This is absolutely one of the most amazing things that I have ever heard!  This review is coming from someone who was born in the late 70's and did not grow up listening to The Beatles.  This amazing sonic experience starts off with 'Come together', which is an intense hard rocker that gets things off to a great start.  'Something' is one of the most absolutely perfect songs that I have ever heard.  It does an extremely effective job of setting and projecting just the right mood for the lyrics.  This love song is perfectly constructed and really pushes the listener to be wholly submerged in the artists' world while listening.  'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' is another great song.  The tone of this song is like that of a joyous childlike sing-a-long but the song is about some psycho who preys on his victims with a silver hammer.  You can almost hear Paul McCartney's sarcastic sneer and those of us who have a strong appreciation for irony can't help but get a kick out of this one.  'Oh! Darling' starts off with an almost doo-wop feel to it, but then escalates into an intense singing from the gut  rocker.  'Octopus' Garden' is a really well put together song that is excellent for what it is, but I personally do not care much for it, although I will say that its light and sunny tone acts as the perfect prelude to the dark and intense, 'I want you (She's so heavy)'.  This song is one of the greatest rock songs that I have ever heard.  The way that Lennon sings the same notes that he plays right in tune with the guitar is very Hendrix-like.  He completely pulls you into his world for this one and it makes for quite an intense and ultimately cathartic experience.  'Here comes the sun' is a beautiful sunny song with a really bright and optimistic undertone to it.  'Because' will allow you to just zone out and lose yourself in its sonic depths.  The lyrics are basically a series of ironic thought provoking plays on words.  They display brilliant and witty irony by basically comparitively use words in phrases that involve both their literal sense and their figurative sense.  In this song, their voices are like fine-tuned instruments that blend together perfectly with the other instruments to melt into a wonderful world of bliss.  'You never give me your money' is a great song that really is like four mini-songs put together.  The beginning piano part is my favorite.  It sets the perfect mood to allow you to stay subdued after experiencing 'Because'.  It then trancsends into a much more uptempo part.  This part connects with another uptempo part which speaks about getting a grip on and rising above your current situation.  It then ends with a sing-a-long chorus with a great guitar solo to go along with it.  'Sun King' is like a dreamy spaced out break in a sense, and this is yet another great song.  Now the famous suite begins.  Listening to the ending song suite is just a magnificent experience because it just feels so perfect.  It feels like timeless musical masters had just come up with their grand finale, which is exactly what this is.  This album earned my total and complete respect for The Beatles.  If I had not heard this one first, I probably would not have given the rest of their catalog a chance.  I now own this album and the preceeding five because I am so impressed with 'Abbey Road'.  All of the  preceeding five are brilliant in their own right but this one here is unsurpassed by any of them.  I would strongly recommend this album to everyone who honestly loves music.
B00007AJIT|1.0|Uh...this movie is just stupid...not even interesting in the least bit. I don't know why it was nominated for an acedemy award or whatever. Really...it's a big waste of money. If you're somewhat rational and intelligent...then this movie will really suck. After I saw it I was disappointed big time, it's so dumb they made a movie about going into John Malcovich's mind..and why only 15 minutes?...to be honest I dunno why some of these other reviewers gave it as many stars as they did. Anyway there are better movies to watch than this...like Lord of the Rings for example. Ok, well hope this is a helpful review.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|The following is a quote from an extremely stupid person: <br />If you listen to the Devils Night album its about 100x better than this album. This album isnt rap, its pop. D12 is supposibly a \\"band\\" now which their not. They used to be a rap group now their a pop band. There is no goods songs on this album. The only song decent on it is 40Oz. The only song that sounds anything like they used to is keep talking the bonus track. The album is crap and i would highly recommend listening to clips of the songs before u buy it. If you like what u hear then u like pop, and not rap. And probably shouldnt browse in the rap section anymore. All this is, is black people singing pop, so they say its rap. This album sucks period. <br /> <br />Ok, who sings on this album?  The point of My Band wasn't to say that they're a band now, they're making fun of the fact that people accidently call them a band.  To call a song like Good Die Young crap is really disrespectful to not only the memory of Bugz, but to anyone who's ever lost a friend.  You're saying that songs like How Come, Just Like U, My Band, and all the other amazing tracks on this album are bad?  Also, like I said before, they sing?  I musta missed that track.  Em sings in the My Band chorus, but that's to make fun of rock/pop bands, like some people make them out to be.  From your review, it sounds like you're reviewing crap like Snoop Dogg, RBX, Ja Rule, or 50 Cent.  LOL, you probably like them, cause you hate all the good music, and make the bad music.  I mean, I know everyone can have their own opinion, but still it's really insane to hate on this album.
B0001AP158|1.0|I guess this is what happens to mega-rock stars who have too much money and too much time: <br /> <br />They forget what made them what they are today, and, even more importantly, they forget the people who got them to where they are today - their true fans. <br /> <br />Don't buy this crap. It isn't worth the kilojoules you burn to put it into your dvd player.
6302453356|2.0|Belive me, I am being generous in giving this 2 stars. If it wasn't for CUTE little Maggie I would give it 1 star. In the first place, I don't like the whole concept of the movie. Peter Pan isn't supposed to grow up. That's the whole point! Sure, this movie has some good stuff in it but there's so much bad stuff it's not even worth it. Also it had a lot of bad words and gross insults. Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys (Rufio most of all!) were very irritating. I mean, skateboards and graffiti in Neverland? And another thing: Tootles was very, very creepy. The two best parts in it were when Moira was telling Peter Banning how little time they have with their children, and the other was when Maggie says \\"Look what Jack drew!\\" That part is really funny. I know some friends of mine really like this movie, so maybe it's a thing where you either love it or hate it. If you want to watch a Peter Pan movie, don't watch this (especially not with your kids): instead, watch P.J. Hogan's MASTERPIECE Peter Pan from 2003.
B0002234LS|2.0|I enjoyed this up to the last part, which is predictable if you're expecting the story to turn out to be a bust, but disappointing if you're expecting something interesting.  Johnny Depp is splendid until the end where he turns into Norman Bates.  I'm not a Stephen King fan, and this movie did not make me a convert.  On the plus side, the setting is wonderful, and Depp's portrayal of a man going through the agony of divorce and self-doubt is compelling.
B000002UC5|5.0|After, I must shamefully admit, not having owned this album in over twenty-six years, I picked it up again last week, and the spell was cast hard on me, once again.<br /><br />This is McCartney circa Let It Be, already convinced that The Beatles were over and that there was plenty of music in him that needed to be let out. And, like a poet's notebook, it has the breadth of themes that you expect from someone who's searching for new languages rather than planning to present a finished, solid statement to the public.<br /><br />Of course, being Paul, you don't get the benefit of exploring musically without being condemned for not attempting a masterpiece, so many then, and now, may have discarded \\"McCartney\\" as self-indulging, inconsistent or a bunch of rough ideas.<br /><br />Actually, I go on record as saying that it is the \\"unfinished\\" or \\"demo\\" quality of this album that accounts for part of its immense charm. Furthermore, the apparent freedom Paul gave himself recording these tunes, I believe, has a lot to do with the gems he included here. After all, this is where you'll find the original version of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed,\\" to this date one of his greatest songs ever.<br /><br />In addition to such classic, there are several other songs that were or could have been Beatles classics. \\"Junk\\" is a gorgeous ballad that reminds you why this man continues to be revered as a sensitive songwriter and singer, \\"Every Night\\" is irresistible Pop, and \\"Man We Was Lonely\\" and That Would Be Something\\" are signature McCartney and a preview of what would be so appealing about Ram.<br /><br />This is a document of an extremely talented young man trying to get to the joy of making music that had eluded him for a long time, weighed down by the tremendous pressure of being in the greatest band that ever was.<br /><br />Listen to this, or listen again, for what it is, a work of charm, courage, and often breathtaking beauty.
B00023B1LC|2.0|This is a vapid cash grab, a DVD that doesn't need to exist because the original DVD release is good enough.<br />The Explosive Edition is anything but.  First, this is probably the most cheaply produced DVD I have seen, with lackluster menus and annoying &quot;previews&quot; that start the DVD (for Dawn of the Dead and Magnum PI of all things).  I could have happily lived my whole life having never watched the bookend scenes that were dropped from the film, and the annoying documentary that was parsed into the beginning of the film explaining why they dropped them (because they were boring and meaningless??).  Also, the Extended scenes were not even editted into the film, you have to press the Select button when an icon appears on the screen in order to access these bookend scenes.<br />Even if your a fan of the Bourne identity, you can avoid this disk, and get the original release which I feel was given better treatment then this rushed edition.  If you already have the first release, don't bother with this, as it doesn't over any new insight into the making of the movie.
B00005UWBQ|2.0|This movie is kind of drab, monotonous and uninteresting. All of the wonder, magic and thrills of the first film (a masterpiece) are gone. Instead we get Malcolm thrown on an island with a some totally uninteresting characters (including his girlfriend and daughter, but especially everyone else), in a dark barrage of somehow boring dino action scenes. Not much in this movie stands out, as opposed to the original where every scene was uniquely captivating. This movie just doesn't have a spark to it.  <br /> <br />Ian Malcolm made a great character in Jurassic Park. He had a big impact in a small role. Here, he's in the lead, and either the character isn't cut out for it or the writing wasn't done in the right way to make it work. 'Cus it doesn't work. He's boring here. The whole movie is boring. Even the dinosaurs are boring. It just never takes off the ground. I can't say I cared for the book version either, I still haven't managed to read it completely. But it's pretty funny that the movie combined two characters to form Malcolm's super-gymnist daughter. Why didn't they use two seperate kids? One kid is lonely. One kid doesn't work. <br /> <br />And the ending. Dear Lord. The T-Rex flying down a city street destroyed whatever sense of integrity and wonder this movie had. They made the T-Rex mundane somehow by bringing it into the every day world. It was just cheap, cheesy, and sucked any enjoyment out of the film. Bah. <br /> <br />So, it wasn't too great of a movie. Sadly, in comparison to Jurassic Park 3, it's brilliant.
B00005JNEI|1.0|A brilliant filmmaker with no integrity. In other words, a master of propaganda.
B00003CXXR|1.0|And a pathetic excuse for a movie, period. This was obviously thrown together by the uninspired and talentless and put out just to make money. The special effects are under par and down right cartoony looking, the story is unengaging, the writing is sometimes absurd (example, \\"Alan Grant\\" telling people that if raptors hadn't died out, they and not humans would have become the dominant species on earth!!) and always weak, the scenes of humans meeting dinosaurs are poorly executed and ineffective...in fact, every scene is poorly executed and ineffective. The characters are boring and unlikable and I couldn't have cared less about any of them aside from Grant, who I wished wasn't in this piece of crap. The fact that they used pieces from the wonderful original score made it worse. This movie is awful. It was directed by the same man who directed Jumanji, and it shows. This is a pile of Spinosaurus dung that's disrespectful to the first movie and to anybody who loved it.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|Cold Mountain was okay, but there were just too many things that bothered me about this film.  It opens beautifully and the battle scenes are wonderful (if that is an apt adjective) but there is just too much.  Ruby, who was black in the book, is now Ms. Z. and she acts the part like she is gonna get an Oscar if it kills her after she lost the two previous times. Kidman is beautiful.  Too beautiful.  Always coordinated, always clean. Always looking like she is ready for a photo shoot - in the middle of the Civil War no less!  Law is pretty good here, so I will leave him alone.  The thing that bugged me most was - it really did not look like the American south.

B00005LC1H|5.0|Few TV shows pass what I call the ultimate DVD test: is it so well done that you'll want to watch it again and again, and still get pleasure. Fawlty Towers ranks with the Honeymooners at the top of this select class. The similarities are thought-provoking. Both were \\"filmed\\" on a remarkably spare, almost theatrical sets. Both featured what might be called choreographed physical comedy as well as wit, whether it was John Cleese goosestepping his way through \\"Germans\\" or Jackie Gleason doing the Hucklebuck with Art Carney and \\"Mrs. Manicotti.\\" I've watched every episode at least a dozen times over the years, and like fine wine, it seems only to improve with age. By all means buy this priceless collection.
B00005JMUA|4.0|Part two of Kill Bill is excellent in it's own right.  As the second part of the duo, though, it lacks a little of Part One's energy.  Hence the 4 rather than 5 stars on this entry.  Uma continues to amaze here as the Bride and in this installment, I half expected her to have a shootout with Eastwood - both wearing dusters, of course!  Hannah is a hoot in this and her showdown with the Bride gives Lucy Lui a run for her money.  Excellent follow-up to an even more excellent begining.
B0000033OZ|5.0|In the world of prog rock, there are not too many bands who got it right the first time. It took both Yes and Genesis three albums before they really start to take off. And for Jethro Tull, it took them four or five albums, as they made the transition from the blues to prog rock. Not saying that the albums these groups did before Aqualung or Thick is a Brick (Jethro Tull), The Yes Album, or Nursery Cryme were bad (with the probable exception of From Genesis to Revelation, which I thought was pretty bad, but still of historical interest), but it's the common case of \\"showing great potentional\\" that the finally showed after the third try or so. But it's really nice to see ELP pulled it off the first time. But then Keith Emerson, Greg Lake, and Carl Palmer all had recording experience prior, so that explains a lot. Emerson was with The Nice, who made some good music, but the vocals of Lee Jackson really weren't suited for the task, and he often ruined many of their songs. Greg Lake was with King Crimson, and appeared on their classic In the Court of the Crimson King, and it's (often regarded in a lesser-light) followup, the similarly titled (and partly similarly-sounding) In the Wake of Poseidon. And Carl Palmer played in the Crazy World of Arthur Brown (apparently did not appear on the 1968 album with the hit \\"Fire\\", but Drachen Theaker did), but only when they toured since Theaker was afraid of flying. Then he jumped board with former Crazy World organist Vincent Crane to form Atomic Rooster, and appeared only on their 1970 debut. So basically ELP consisted of disenfranchised musicians needing a place new to express themselves. <br /> <br />Their debut might not be their easiest album to get in to, but it's full of great material still the same. The album opens up with \\"The Barbarian\\", which consisted of some workings of classical songs, done ELP style, with lots of great piano and organ work. Greg Lake gives us the wonderful ballad \\"Take a Pebble\\". This is perhaps the closest to the King Crimson sound, but without the Mellotrons (as Emerson was no fan of that instrument, apparently), and with lots of wonderful piano. There's a section where the music slows down quite a bit, with just Greg Lake playing his acoustic guitar, before the song picks up, with more piano, and the whole band participating, before the vocal track returns. Then you get the wonderful classic \\"Knife-Edge\\". Wonderful, sinister atmosphere, with some killer organ. This is perhaps the closest to heavy prog you get on this album. \\"The Three Fates\\" was obviously Emerson's showcase. It starts off with some majestic, over-the-board pipe organ (which I thought worked much better than \\"Infinate Space/The Only Way\\" from Tarkus), before he switches over to piano. Then the whole bands gets in to the game, but with Emerson's piano still dominating. \\"Tank\\" starts off with Emerson playing clavinet, but here's the only weak spot on the album: Palmer's drum solo, which I found pretty pointless. But after the solo, comes the synthesizer, the first time you hear it on this album. Many might mistake this as the first album to use synthesizer (it's not, as the Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, the Byrds, and the Monkees had all used one before them), but it was definately one of the groundbreaking albums as far as synthesizers were concerned, as Emerson really put creative use in to this monster III-C modular Moog. Then the final song is the classic FM hit \\"Lucky Man\\", written by Lake. To casual listeners, they would simply think this as a simple folk-rock song with some silly synthesizer tagged at the end. It's little wonder why this received so much radio airplay: it pretty much stuck to the proven rock formula, so when buyers bought the album when it came out, they were in a shock to see how little the rest of the album resembles that song. Still, despite \\"Lucky Man\\" being different from the rest of the album, it's still a great classic, and I do like the synthesizer that closes it. This is truly a great album, and anyone in to prog rock should own this.
B00003CXXS|3.0|Has anyone heard the phrase, \\"Two's a party, three's a crowd\\"? Apparently not the mega-movie studio executives, who feel they can invite as many to the celebration as they want even if the end result is the movie-going public developing enochlophobia. The Hollywood obsession of maintaining a steady flow of profits through franchise pictures can be a mixed blessing to the public. On the one hand, series like The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter have gotten better in quality and enjoyment with each new film. But on the other hand, there are the few, most notably the Batman and Superman franchises (at least prior to their modern day revitalizations), that steadily decline in value as the number of films stack up. With The Lost World: Jurassic Park being officially labeled one of the worst sequels in recent memory, the third installment in the film series that had so much promise has a lot to overcome to ensure that this franchise doesn't disappoint. <br /> <br />The story centers once again on the island of Isla Sorna, also known as site B, where humans have landed as part of a rescue mission only to be in need of rescuing themselves from monstrous prehistoric creatures of all shape and size. Dr. Alan Grant, one of the few survivors from the tragic events that took place at InGen's Jurassic Park theme park in 1993, swore there would be no force on heaven or earth that would get him to return to that island, but times have changed. The once flourishing archeology business is now floundering as experts have become more interested in studying the living \\"theme-park attractions\\" created by InGen then the dusty bones of the past when it comes to the field of dinosaurs. Desperate for grant money to test his raptor intelligence theory, Grant agrees to join a \\"wealthy\\" couple in an aerial tour of Isla Sorna. But when their plane crash lands on the island and the group barely escape their first dinosaur encounter, the truth comes out. The two \\"adventurers\\" are actually a disengaged couple whose son, while on a thrill-seeking trip with a friend, was lost somewhere on the island. Now the group must face previously unknown dangers, ones undisclosed by InGen, as they make a desperate attempt to escape the island with their lives. The story for Jurassic Park III, as audacious as it tries to be by including crucial plot developments that should have been including in the last sequel, is once again strenuously predictable and presents a film that is nothing different then what audiences have seen in the last two films. Did Universal not get the message that public reaction to The Lost World was horrendous? You would think that with a sequel that received as much bad word of mouth as that film did, you would make a legitimate effort to win back audiences with at least a solid script, but that isn't the case at all here. <br /> <br />Taking a page from The Lost World's playbook, only one cast member from the original Jurassic Park film returns to the franchise joining a relatively undistinguished cast when one considers the demographic audience the studio is aiming for with this film. Sam Neill, who once again returns to the world of Jurassic Park in the role of Dr. Alan Grant, appears as though he is seriously contemplating where his acting career went wrong that he had to return to doing films like this. This isn't to say that his performance isn't up to par, in fact there seems to be little difference from the first film of how he portrays the character, but that he deserves better gigs then this. William H. Macy, who deserves so much more for his career then a starring role in a B-movie like this, works well with the material that is given to him and no one knowing the quality of the screenplay can ask for anything beyond that. Yes, the character is predictable, in the same light as the rest of the movie, but Macy gives him a charming, if not slightly bumbling, persona that makes the audience care about him. Unfortunately, this can not be said for the rest of the cast of characters. Jurassic Park III plays out in much the same way as Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection do when it comes to killing off characters, the audience simply doesn't care. The group is barely on the island less then ten minutes and two characters, ones we don't get any background on what-so-ever outside the fact that they are mercenaries, are killed right off the bat. The original two films, even the Lost World which, by all definition, was a disaster, gave each character a distinct personality and let the audience get a specific grasp on them so that when the killing started, we would know whether to root or fear for their safety. <br /> <br />Overall, Jurassic Park III, despite showing slight, if not trifling, improvements from the last installment, indicates the once vibrant franchise may be on its last leg and should go the way of the prehistoric beasts it was based on - to extinction. For those have no prior experience involved with the Jurassic Park franchise (what rock have you been hiding under?), JP3 can be an entertaining, if not enjoyable, B-movie experience with none of the usual burden of being the least bit memorable. On the other hand, if you happen to be one of those individuals who expects better from a highly-anticipated sequel then the same formulaic. Applause must be given to the filmmakers for at least attempting to relinquish to the requests of the franchise fanatics wanting difference and originality with the sequels. Sadly these improvements come too little too late. These simple changes to the series (namely new dinosaurs and more personality to the creatures) should have been made in The Lost World and by having them done here feels like a desperate attempt to breathe life back into this tired franchise. All in all, Jurassic Park III doesn't handle itself like a original feature but rather it comes off as a regurgitation of all the great elements of the first film and the worst aspects (and there were many)from the second, all blended together in a syrupy mess that works alright but can be easily forgotten. With the success that met this film upon its opening weekend, there's no doubt that another sequel is once again in the works over at Universal Studios. Let's just hope that they get the message this time around and actually venture on something original with the franchise.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I'm A Slave 4 U-Hot, new beat. Quite the ear candy. Though it only contains one verse, the song doesn't lose its hold. It truly captivates you into a world of pop and just makes you wanna dance. <br />Rating: 9.9/10 <br /> <br />Overprotected-A Max Martin song. But an extremely, good and catchy one! One of the highlights of the disc. Also makes you just wanna get up and dance. <br /> <br />9.9/10 <br /> <br />Lonely-Another upbeat song. The bridge of this song is awesome. A real girl power song about a girl saying she'd rather be alone than be with a guy that's mistreated her. <br />9.6/10 <br /> <br />I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman-The only real ballad on the CD. When I first heard it, it was an okay ballad. But after a few listens and a look at the lyrics, I got into it and I applied it to my life. Plus, good vocals! <br />9.7/10 <br /> <br />Boys-A song you would most likely hear in a club. Like the previous song, it took a few listens to really get into it. I like it now, though. It has a different, kind of offbeat rhythm than what you would find in her previous work (BOMT, OIDIA), kinda like \\"Slave\\". <br />9.3/10 <br /> <br />Anticipating-I'm just not feeling this song. It's a Janet Jackson kind of ditty with happy disco beats. I don't like it that much, but it's still okay. <br />7/10 <br /> <br />I Love Rock n' Roll-Great cover, the beats are awesome. And you can just feel the attitude in her voice. Cool song. <br />9.5/10 <br /> <br />Cinderella-Umm...I think this should've been on OIDIA. No surprise, it's made by Max Martin. Not that it's bad or anything. I like it! So... <br />9.6/10 <br /> <br />Let Me Be-Oooooh! I just love the little tropical beat to this song. Awesome beat, good vocals, catchy, overall great song. <br />9.9/10 <br /> <br />Bombastic Love-When I first heard the title, I was like, \\"What the heck?! This better not be a reggae, Shaggy-like song!\\" Thank the Lord it wasn't. But anyways...I dunno. Doesn't the chorus sound like \\"Oops!\\"??? Still, an extremely pop tune. And I mean catchy. This could stick in your head for weeks. Oh, and I also love the beginning intro part (with the, it kinda sounds like a triangle, don't it?) <br />9.5/10 <br /> <br />That's Where You Take Me-Sweet, kind of ballad. Whenever you listen to it, you just start smiling, don't you? Just try to resist it!  <br />9.8/10 <br /> <br />What It's Like To Be Me-Awesome string outro! You can just tell it was written by Justin and Wade. Tight beat and awesome chorus. Another song where you can just hear the attitude in Brit's voice. <br />9.5/10 <br /> <br />
B000062YAY|4.0|I've  always liked live albums because it shows what a band are really capable of.  Stripped of all the studio trickery and aids such as looping and endless overdubbing, a band actually has to play in order to make a performance worth listening to.  Listening to a live album is not the same as seeing the band because the visual element can compensate for crap musicianship.  This is a very good live album.  Slayer play with a furious intensity throughout and many of the songs are better live.  For example all the songs from the wretched sounding \\"Show No Mercy\\" album sound MUCH better on DOA.  They're faster, more agressive and don't have that early '80s reverb on the vocals (whoever thought that was a good idea should be flayed alive)  In fact all the songs prior to Reign in Blood sound better on DOA.  Overall the playing is topnotch, props to Dave Lombardo who plays with a single minded agressive purpose: take no prisoners.  And Kerry and Jeffs' guitar solos have to be heard to be believed.  I think guitarists everywhere whether they're metal heads or not would appreciate their musicianship.<br /><br />The only complaint is that the sound/mix just isn't as good as it could be.  The drums are muddy, the bass is far too low and the guitars when soloing are clear, but the rhythm playing lacks definition and volume.  So I gotta kick off a star for that.  Otherwise DOA is a great live album and worth getting even if you have the studio albums.
B0000062GK|5.0|I just think it's all kind of great. The licks he comes up with are just so hooking. A train of angels is my favorite. I love joe on drop d. The power chords in the chorus are great and the intro is very inventive. The intro and outro on rasberry are awesome. Time is one of the best songs of all time because of the chorus and especially the 6/4 outro. Up in the sky, crystal planet, trundrumbalind, and psycho monkey are my other favorites. Crystal Planet is great.
B0000524CY|5.0|There are some movies made that go on to achieve epic like status and become permanently ingrained in people's psyches. This is one of those films. Author William Peter Blatty wrote the novel after he was inspired by a story when he was attending college. It was a story of a young 13 year old boy who was apparently possessed and the exorcism that took place to rid the boy of the evil force. His book became The Exorcist, and it was given the silver screen treatment. Director William Friedkin, hot off \\"The French Connection\\", was brought on to board to make the film. Ellen Burstyn stars as Chris MacNeil, a single movie actress with a 12 year old daughter named Reagan(Linda Blair). The two live in a nice Georgetown townhouse and all seems well. It isn't long that Reagan begins exhibiting strange and odd behavior and it is without any kind of explanation. The doctors bring the idea of an exorcism to Ms. MacNeil, to rid her daughter of whatever demonic force has taken hold of her. Enter Father Damien Karras(Jason Miller), a priest with his own troublems, including the questioning of his own faith. The brilliant Max Von Sydow is Father Merrin, an elderly man of the cloth is called upon to perform the exorcism. I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said. The film has an undeniable sense of fear and dread from the very beginning. It creates a disturbing feeling and image that crawls under your skin and stays there. The acting is teriffic. Sydow was only 44 when he did this, but you would really believe that he was 30 years or so older. Amazing. Linda Blair is fantastic as the put upon Reagan, and she won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar. Burstyn is really good. You really feel for her and believe that she is a woman who is quickly falling apart as her daughter is being ravaged by some force. Jason Miller brings a strong, intense presence to his role, and the camera eats him up in every scene. The film also boasts one of the finest scary soundtracks captured on film. \\"Tubular Bells\\" is chilling, haunting, and unforgettable. The make-up on little Reagan is some of the most chilling and frightening images caught on film. Her \\"episodes\\" and final exorcism are bone chilling and some of the most frightening and scariest pieces of film. Friedkin is someone who knows how to scare the crap out of people and he does it with a sure hand. There are a few scenes here that are classic and just those images will always be remembered and stand the test of time. I think a certain image of Father Merrin standing under that street light is the best. It's a shame that the film got a severe case of \\"Sequelitis\\". Part 2 is one of the worst films/sequels ever, but Part 3 was decent enough to watch. Make no mistake, nothing will ever erase the raw and powerful imagery and story of this film. Nothing. There is a reason this film is always at the top of every horror/scary movie list. It is that good, and yes, it is that downright scary.

B0002IU988|3.0|To say I was upset when Creed split is a bit of an understatement. I wasn't one of those crazy fans who contemplated suicide, nor did I threaten to show up at band members' houses with oozies; but I did mope around my house for a week playing my Weathered CD over and over with a kleenex close at hand. <br /> <br />Even in my gloom, I saw a little ray of light at the end of the tunnel when I learned about Alter Bridge. It's a new band that's rising out of Creed's ashes, formed by Mark Tremonti, Scott Phillips, and Brian Marshall, all band alumni. My hopes were high when I picked up Bridge's new record at Wal-Mart last night, but they were quickly dashed when I turned on my walkman. <br /> <br />I suppose I'll go ahead and start with the good news first. The music is definitely top notch. Not only do Phillips and Marshall shine, but Tremonti comes back bigger and better than ever. He lets those metal rifts flow in face-melting solos and moving melodies. He surpasses anything he's done before on the three Creed records and proves once again that he deserves a place amongst the great guitarists in music history. <br /> <br />But all the band's musical talent can't make up for the fact that their new lead singer, Myles Kennedy, can't sing worth a flying flip. From the first song I heard, all I could do was shake my head in utter frustration as his pained wailing drowned out great tunes and butchered good lyrics. He lacks Stapp's strong pipes and heartfelt intensity. Instead, he comes across as straining and weak. He manages to deliver a hand full of passable executions scattered throughout the album, but, in the end, he remains but a fuzzy shadow in the wake of Stapp's supernova brilliance. <br /> <br />Overall, I give the record three out of five stars, mainly because the band delivers such strong performances. Otherwise, I suggest Tremonti, Phillips, and Marshall look into finding another lead singer. Someone who doesn't sound like he's bursting a lung every time he hits a high note.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I will try not to hide behind insults, name-calling, or any other nonsense I have seen while reading reviews of this movie. <br />The main problem I have with 'The Passion of the Christ' is that it is a wide-scale attempt to achieve what white Europeans have been attempting to do for the last thousand or so years. What is this thing that they have been attempting to achieve? Hegemony, power over other peoples. The main way this has been done is through Christianity. Missionaries would come into villages of Mayans, Africans, Native Americans, Indians, or Asians, and try to 'save' them with the power of Christ. However, what these missionaries were actually doing was destroying the unique and varied beliefs of these peoples by dictating that their customs were 'savage'. It is this destruction of culture that has created a huge problem for me in my life. I have often had a hard time coming to terms with my Christianity because I know what people have done in the name of Christ. Throughout the last 2000 years, Christ's suffering has been used to justify the slaughtering of Muslims, Jews, and other cultures, and basically the westernazation of most of the world. I remember one year watching the Grammys and seeing a Native American man thanking Christ for helping him create this album of traditional tribal chants, and thinking that almost all Native Americans have been taught to respect their culture, but at the same time realizing that Christ is real and the belief system of their culture is not.  <br />Back to the Passion- basically this movie is attempting to apply scare tactics to convince more people to become 'saved' by Christ. It guilt trips the viewer to think that it is because of him that these horrible things are happening, and that he or she is a terrible person for letting this happen to Christ, while an accurate cinematic depiction of the Crusades would have had a larger number of people going through things that either equal or exceed the pain and the suffering that Jesus is going through in 'The Passion'.  <br />Now, it is easy to say that 'The Passion' was targeted just at a Christian audience to remind them over Lent about the suffering of Christ. Why then was this movie so heavily marketed, and why did Mel Gibson swirl up so much of a controversy? Just looking at the amount of money this movie made at the box office it is easy to see that Mel Gibson did not just intend this movie for a Christian audience. In fact, I distinctivly remember Mel Gibson encouraging everyone to see this film, such as Michael Moore did with his latest 'Farenheit 9/11'.  <br />So here is my message to the consumer- Please if you really want to see this movie, keep in mind that it is one man's opinion, and you should not be pressured into feeling guilty over Christ's death if you do not already feel so. Keep a level head while watching this movie and do not come to any rash conclusions about how guilty this movie made you feel.
B00004Z4YA|5.0|Hard to believe, but it's been a good four years since the original release of Coldplay's debut album in the UK (the US release would follow in Nov. 2000), and as the phenom called Coldplay is getting bigger and bigger, it's now clear that \\"Parachutes\\" is a classic, in every sense of the word. By now, the original 10 tracks of the album all have become so instantly familiar, yet never tiresome. There is of course \\"Yellow\\", the US break-through single but for me probably the weakest track on the set. Check out instead \\"Shiver\\", \\"Don't Panic\\" (with the immortal line \\"We Live in a Beautiful World\\"), \\"Trouble\\" and Sparks\\", 4 other singles from the album (all of them still available on Amazon).<br /><br />This import version of \\"Parachutes\\" (13 tracks, 49 min.) comes with 3 additional tracks on a separate CD: \\"Help is 'Round the Corner\\", which is a b-side from the \\"Yellow\\" single, and then also \\"Careful Where You Stand\\" and \\"For You\\", both of which are the b-sides from the \\"Shiver\\" single. All the bonus tracks are from around the same time as the \\"Parachutes\\" recording sessions, and are a great fit with the original tracks of the album.<br /><br />Who knows whether the next Coldplay album (rumored for Sprong 2005) will be any good, but for sure it's gonna be a monster, and Coldplay is well on its way to be the next U2.

By now, the original 10 tracks of the album all have become so instantly familiar, yet never tiresome. There is of course \\"Yellow\\", the US break-through single but for me probably the weakest track on the set. Check out instead \\"Shiver\\", \\"Don't Panic\\" (with the immortal line \\"We Live in a Beautiful World\\"), \\"Trouble\\" and Sparks\\", 4 other singles from the album (all of them still available on Amazon).<br /><br />The Australian import version of \\"Parachutes\\" (14 tracks, 56 min.) comes with 4 additional tracks on a separate CD: \\"Sparks\\" in the album version (nothing new here), but then also \\"Careful Where You Stand\\" which is a b-side from the \\"Shiver\\" single, \\"Yellow\\" in an accoustic version that in my opinion is actually better than the original version, and the hauntingly beautiful \\"See You Soon\\", which originally appeared on the \\"Blue Room\\" EP. Both \\"Careful\\" and \\"See You Soon\\" are essentials in the Coldplay catalogue.<br /><br />We now await Coldplay's new album, which supposedly will come out in Spring 2005. Who knows whether that's gonna be any good, but for sure it's gonna be a monster, and Coldplay is well on its way to be the next U2. Meanwhile, enjoy the humble and intimate debut album which I dare say Chris and the boys will never surpass.
B000002H97|4.0|In 1990, metallica sort of diverded from complexity and went on through sheer riffs.

B00005NB0H|4.0|As an owner of both \\"Live At Leeds: Complete\\" (See previous reviews for an explanation of what this is) And \\"Live At Leeds: Deluxe\\" I have to say a few things about what some people are trying to pass as facts:<br /><br />A. ALL THE SONGS THAT WERE PLAYED AT THE CONCERT ARE HERE! Some people claim that songs from Tommy are missing, the reason they are missing is THEY WEREN'T PLAYED AT THE CONCERT<br /><br />B. EXCEPT FOR THE PLACEMENT OF THE TOMMY SET, ALL THE SONGS ARE IN THE CORRECT ORDER THAT THEY WERE PLAYED. Some people think that some of the songs from the Tommy set were moved around, they weren't, on TOMMY, FIDDLE ABOUT comes after PINBALL WIZARD, on LAL, FIDDLE ABOUT comes before PINBALL WIZARD<br /><br />Ok, now that that's out of the way, on with the review!<br /><br />Disc one is pretty much the same shtick that came out in 1995, except the sound qualiy isn't as good, the songs are brilliant, especially Heaven And Hell, A Quick One  [While He's Away], Magic Bus and My Generation. One or two more gripes before i continue:<br /><br />A. About 2 minutes were editted out of My Generation<br /><br />B. About 2 minutes were editted out of Magic Bus<br /><br />The knowledge of these edits comes from being an owner of LALC<br /><br />Disc Two:<br /><br />Sound quality: Ugggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.<br /><br />The sound quality is really REALLY BAD on disc 2, when the other people said that it sound as though it was recorded through a tin can, they weren't kidding! And I think I know why this is, LAL has been released and re-released on LP, Cassette, CD, CD [remastered and expanded], CD [Deluxe] and Pretty soon, SACD and DVD Audio. Now, the entire concert [almost] is out, pretty soon, people will stop buying remasters of this concert, but Pete wants to continue to make money from the remasters so he made the audio crappy so he could fix it and re-release it again later.<br /><br />It's really sad that the audio is so crappy, on LAL:C, the set from Tommy is AWESOME!!!!<br /><br />Get this Album if you ABSOLUTELY MUST, it's a WHO essential, but to tell you the truth, i would recommend the 1995 Remaster over this, the set from Tommy will be released again later, you can count on Petey to do that.Tommy is AWESOME!!!! <br /> <br />Get this Album if you ABSOLUTELY MUST, it's a WHO essential, but to tell you the truth, i would recommend the 1995 Remaster over this, the set from Tommy will be released again later, you can count on Petey to do that.

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is a born rebel with a unique sense of personality and style. Her album, Let Go, is basically pop. <br /> <br />1.) \\"Losing Grip\\"=8/10~This song is a dark and catchy opener. I once heard that this is Avril's favorite track, and I can see why.  <br /> <br />2.) \\"Complicated\\"=9/10~When I first heard of Avril Lavigne, this was the song that was playing.  <br /> <br />3.) \\"Sk8er Boi\\"=11/10~This is the best track on the entire record (!!!), and I can see why they play it on the radio a lot.  <br /> <br />4.) \\"I'm With You\\"=9/10~It has a nice storyline to it.  <br /> <br />5.) \\"Mobile\\"=8/10~To me, this song seems to be one of the fillers, but I like it anyway.  <br /> <br />6.) \\"Unwanted\\"=10/10~This is quite an edgy song about a relationship gone wrong. I love it!  <br /> <br />7.) \\"Tomorrow\\"=10/10~It is nice to see Avril sensitive every once in awhile.  <br /> <br />8.) \\"Anything But Ordinary\\"=10/10~That you are, Avril; that you are...:)  <br /> <br />9.) \\"Things I'll Never Say\\"=10/10~This is a nice and cute, lil' love-song from the antagonized \\"sk8er-gurl\\": Priceless.  <br /> <br />10.) \\"My World\\"=9/10~A nice visual of an average life in the small-town of Napanee, Ontario. I especially like the part when she says that she got fired by \\"fried-chicken ass.\\" (Tee-hee!)  <br /> <br />11.) \\"Nobody's Fool\\"=9/10~Avril is an AWESOME rapper, and I think she should do it more often.  <br /> <br />12.) \\"Too Much To Ask\\"=8/10~Avril sounds kinda' \\"country-ish\\" in this song.  <br /> <br />13.) \\"Naked\\"=10/10~This is a nice way to end the album...One of my favorite songs...  <br /> <br />All in all, this CD is FANTASTIC!!! And trust me, it is definitely worth your twenty bucks.

B00001NFCY|5.0|By 1999 Creed had quietly sold upwards of 4 million copies of its debut album My Own Prison while getting little respect. They were already outselling Korn and Limp Bizkit when they absolutely exploded onto the charts with their 2nd album Human Clay. They also prove they aren't Pearl Jam imitators and are a  great band in their own right. This album once again features roaring guitars, smashing drums and passionate vocals. Creed proved they are a great band with this album and not a flash in the pan. If you like hard rock you will love this album. <br /> <br />1. Are You Ready. 10/10 Great album opener. Sets the tone for the journey Creed is about to take us on. <br /> <br />2. What If. 10/10 Very angry song and very well done. Overall the best song on the album. <br /> <br />3. Beautiful. 9/10 About how beauty is skin deep, I really like the guitars on this one. <br /> <br />4. Say I. 9/10 Another stand out track. Everything is good about this one. <br /> <br />5. Wrong Way. 9/10 I like the drumming on this one. <br /> <br />6. Faceless Man. 9/10 Starts off softer than explosive chorus's take over. <br /> <br />7. Never Die. 10/10 One of the best songs. I love the lyrics, the guitars and drums really go well together. <br /> <br />8. With Arms Wide Open. 10/10 Big radio hit about Scott learning he will be a father. Perfection. <br /> <br />9. Higher. 10/10 Even bigger hit. Don't let it get to you that it was somewhat overplayed, it is a great song. <br /> <br />10. Wash Away Those Years. 9/10 Another great song that masters the soft/hard dynamics wonderfully well. <br /> <br />11. Inside Us All. 9/10 Really inspirational album closer. <br /> <br />Overall a great rocking album with no weak spots. If you can, see these guys live because they know how to play and put on a great show. This album deservingly put them on top of the rock world. Get this album and all of their others. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002IU988|4.0|First off, I hated Creed.  Second off, I love great guitar playing.  I get the impression from listening to this album that Stapp was holding Tremonti back, that is, he wouldn't allow him to go all out like he does on say... One Day Remains.  It's nice to hear pinch harmonics and trem flutters throughout a lot of the songs.  It's like Black Label Society (Zakk Wylde) crossed with early 90s Soundgarden crossed with Core era Stone Temple Pilots.  So it's good stuff, obviously. <br /> <br />All the reviewers that complain that this album is not good seem to think that the best songs on here are the ones that sound like Creed (Open Your Eyes, Broken Wings, etc).  In my opinion, people want this band to sound like Creed and that's why they're disappointed.  I personally think the best songs are the heavy ones.  Tracks 1, 2, 5, 9, and 11 are just awesome; good heavy songs with catchy choruses.  I honestly think Stapp would make these songs rather annoying to listen to, but Myles sounds somewhat like Chris Cornell, who I am used to.  My biggest complaint is that Metallingus doesn't have a guitar solo!!!
B000099T2L|5.0|This is a very good album with smash hits like \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Baby Boy\\". Here's a list of the tracks and ratings. <br /> <br />Crazy in Love- 10/10 first single, a very spunky and up beat song <br />Naughty Girl- 8.5/10 not my favorite song on this album but its sill sexy and hot <br />Baby Boy- 9.5/10 a nice fresh reggae song featuring Sean Paul <br />Hip Hop Star- 10/10 this song has a nice beat <br />Be with You-7.5/10 I like the lyrics to this song but the rythm and beat don't sound that good to me <br />Me, Myself, and I- 9/10 a very good song it speaks out to us ladies  <br />Yes- 9/10 this is a good song nice beat and vocals <br />Signs- 8.5/ 10 this is a good song missy brings it out <br />Speechless- 8.5/10 a nice slow song <br />That's How You Like It- 10/10 love this song good enough to be a single <br />The Closer I Get to You- 8/10 not my favorite but a good song <br />Dangerously in Love 2- 11/10This is my favorite song, I love the chorus and the beat and the style and everything about it! <br />Beyonce Interlude- its an interlude; I can't really rate it <br />Gift From Virgo-5/10 OK <br />Daddy- 10/10 i love this song; it shows how much she loves her daddy <br /> <br /> <br />

0765310015|5.0|If you like entertaining, one or two day reads like Dan Brown, this is NOT for you. If you like simple, easily understandable ideas, this is NOT for you. If you like short, uncomplicated plots, this again is NOT for you. If you like stereotypical fantasy, this is definitely NOT for you. If you like some young kid who comes from nowhere to beat some evil dude who just wants to take over the world for the sake of taking over the world, this is clearly NOT it. <br /> <br />However, if you like sprawling epics, complex plots, amazing vistas, unconventional twists in fantasy, a sense of history so vast and somehow, so very poignant, a book that you will go back to read again and again to try to grasp all that the author is saying, then this is the best every fantasy series you've read. <br /> <br />This is an amazing series. Gardens of the Moon, the first book, is probably the worst of the lot. I lend it to my friends and when I tell them that the first book is the worst (coz Erikson wrote it some nine years before he did the second), they tell me \\"Are you KIDDING me???\\" <br /> <br />The one thing I love the most about Erikson is the way he breaks both real-life and fantasy stereotypes with a couple of simple paragraphs of writing. I love it when someone can make me stop and say, \\"Hey! Maybe what I've always been thinking is not right. Maybe what everyone seems to believe might not be right if we see things from another angle!\\" That is the best (but not the only) distinguishing part of Erikson's writing.  <br /> <br />Get it and you won't regret it.
B00028FDRA|5.0|This is the best new music I've heard in 10 years.  Every track is well worth listening to (many times).  I compare them to no none because they are in a league of their own.  I have listened to everything on all of their CD's and cannot recommend them high enough.  If you want a real treat try ComaLies or Unleashed Memories, you will be glad you did.  <br />I have seen Lacuna Coil live (twice), they are a true force with REAL talent!  ROCK OUT LOUD!!!! <br />
B00024BHTC|5.0|Contrary to the negative reviews you will find regarding this album, this is one of best albums that Nightwish has composed to date. This album tends to focus a little less on Tarja's powerful voice and places more emphasis on the group's talent as a whole. With beautifully blended riffs, powerful symphonic orchestration and some pretty good downright grunge in many areas, this is one of the worlds most talented group of musicians you'll ever listen to. <br /> <br />The negative critics of this album are obviously not musicians and cannot appreciate the music blending and talent of this band. They have propelled to number 1 in Europe - that has to say SOMETHNG! Too bad they don't tour the States more often. America needs more bands like Nightwish instead of the garbage out today that they call 'metal'. <br /> <br />I have listened to every Nightwish album a hundred times over and this band is totally amazing from start to finish. Granted... they have a few songs that don't exactly make the grade, but name 1 band that doesn't! Their most recent music is so powerful and moving that ever since I was introduced to Nightwish, I refuse to listen to anything else. This band does it all and does it the best, so why bother with anything else??

B00005QGAZ|5.0|\\"Thriller\\" won eight grammies, spawned off seven top ten hits (including seven number ones),has sold over 50 million copies worldwide and still is the number one selling album of all time. This is mind you 20 years after the release. 20 years!!! While \\"Off The Wall\\" was a fun, dance album, \\"Thriller\\" got more personal. Jackson added more personality into the record and also, unfortunately, more paranoia and dread, which would lead to his long, strong downfall. <br /> <br />While MTV and Motown can be thanked in large part for the strong reception that \\"Thriller\\" receieved, a huge group of producers, songwriters, musicans, and Michael are the real reasons for this albums massive following. Taking some pointers from \\"Off The Wall\\", Quincy Jones decided to give Michael more creative control with this album. This lead to songs being about deeper topics and issues besides dancing, having fun, and romancing. Michael and Quincy also used seasoned musicans such as Toto, Eddie Van Halen, and Sir Paul McCartney to help in the creation. Mind you Toto had just completed their number one selling album \\"Toto IV\\", which went on to win numerous grammies (including album of the year), and spawn off three top ten hits. Van Halen was in the process of releasing \\"1984\\", one of the top hard rock and party albums in history, so he was in good company, along with McCartney, who needs no introduction. <br /> <br />\\"Thriller\\" maybe in a way is darker than \\"Off The Wall\\", but in the end, the focus is on music that is fun to listen to, full of enthusiasm, and is perfect dance music for clubs and parties. \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\" is like \\"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough\\" part 2, as a blazing dance number, perfect for getting the album kicked off. It is full of weird lyrics that almost make you laugh, but the beat is intoxicating. \\"Baby Be Mine\\" is an album track with lots of soul and R&B in it. Makes me long for the days when Michael wasn't trying to save the world and instead was contentwith getting the dance floor packed. \\"The Girl is Mine\\" is kind of a schmaltzy, cheesy pop duet with Paul McCartney. The song is pretty funny to listen to, especially Paul and Michael fighting at the end. \\"Thriller\\", the title track, is a funky dance number perfect for Halloween. It became more known for it's immensely popular video, which is still ranked by MTV as the best music video of all time. It's haunting lyrics and grooving beats make it almost impossible to not dance to the zombies!! \\"Beat It\\" is a hard rocking dance number where Michael talks about resolving conflicts peacefully. The guitar solo by Eddie Van Halen is especially a treat. \\"Billie Jean\\" is by far MJ's most well known song. The beat, the lyrics, and the moonwalking just make it such a great song to dance to. The song is known as one of top club songs of all time, and as a testement I heard it at three different clubs in a span of month, one in London, one in Omaha, and one in Texas. \\"Human Nature\\" is a smooth R&B number with again lots of soul. \\"P.Y.T.\\" is a dance number that is fun to listen to. \\"The Lady of my Life\\" is a perfect closer, a romantic ballad which is great to listen to with the one you love. <br /> <br />The album has music for everyone to listen to, which defines why it made it's way into so many music collections. Also it is the perfect club/dance album, and is still played at clubs today. MJ and music has been trying, and unsuccessfully, at matching the success of this album today. Artists such as \\"Justin Timberlake\\", \\"Britney Spears\\", \\"NSync\\", and \\"Usher\\" use influences from this album. Do yourself a favor a pick up a copy of not only the best 80's music, but a phenemenon, before he was a white alien in trouble, when he was a good looking African-American artist who wanted to dance the night away and make others have fun doing it as well. <br />

0312263120|1.0|This is the first time in my life that I got half way through a book and seriously considered never opening it again. If it weren't for my tenacious nature and several long subway rides this book would have began collecting dust before it was ever finished. <br />Poor character development is coupled with unrealistic situations. The \\"average\\" people in the book are turned into superheros, but not in a believable Dirk Pitt way. The situations that characters face are not at all realistic and far too coincidental. The read is left with that frustating, \\"Oh, come on...\\" feeling that comes from a complete lack of believability. <br />My biggest complaint is that the puzzle portions of the book were simply solved by the reader well before ariving at the long-winded solution. <br />Additionally the ending was very predicatible, but for one part, and that part was poorly written and did not fit in with the characters. <br />Ok, so it was one of his first books, I'll give Mr. Brown a break. Either way please don't buy this book, it is a waste of time, pick up DaVinci Code instead.
B00006BTCA|3.0|Like said many times on here, I think of JD, it's one thing to be influenced by the band, but it's another thing when there is no creative originality involved. I saw these guys live at the Cure show, and it confused me, \\"Yeah, Joy Division!!!...Oh wait..I thought Ian Curtis hung himself, after doing the same exact sound more than 20 years ago?!\\" all the \\"indie\\" kids around me didn't get it.....Anyhow, I give it 3 stars for being a pretty solid album, I do infact enjoy it some, but it just sounds rehash to me but definantly without the intensity that JD brought. Oh, and by the way, yeah my title refers to a JD song, and it fits pretty nicely huh? Come up with an original sound and I will give you guys a second chance...
B000002HAJ|5.0|i had this cd when it first came out way back in 1992. i liked it but i didn't pay it much attention until last year. i kept wanting to hear the cd but everywhere i went didn't have it or had it for too much. then i got the self titled and was hooked. now i wanted to hear desperately high but i couldn't as the only other cure cd's i had were bloodflowers and show. so i put show on my ipod right before the vacation i took. it was me, my brother, my sister and someone i love dearly in the car. everytime high came i played it. i wore that out on the trip. finally when i got home i bought the cd and fell in love. the immeadiateness of open really hits you. the crunching guitar licks tell you that this isn't going to be a typical cure cd. they were playing a lot more electric guitars then before. a stunning opener. then comes high, truly my favorite cure song, and immediately i am floating sky as a kite. i too have someone i want to hold onto tight and never let go. apart is equally brilliant. i can really relate to this and a lot of what robert sings about esp. about a deep and true love that he doesn't want to lose or has already lost it and is seeing the end of the world. the muddy dark guitar parts really stand out on from the edge of the deep green sea. a real grungy rocker that doesn't lose it potentency even though it's a long song. wendy time and doing the unstuck are truly excellent. i love doing the unstuck. everything comes together so well in this song. the original reason i wanted to buy this cd is for friday i'm in love as that was my favorite song by them, high is now my favorite. i still love friday i'm in love. it's gorgeous guitar parts and the static manic lyrics about being head over heels in love. i can truly relate as i have been head over heals for 4 and 1/2 years now. the rest of the cd is truly remarkable esp. trust. a very small and simple song but very long and extremely amazing. i love the lyrics as they speak as if my heart were singing. thenthere is a letter to elise. i truly love this song as well as it probably my third favorite on here. the guitar solo in the middle is truly stunning. the way the music seems so heavy and light at the same time counters the words about a relationship that is over. the heaviest song as far as guitars go is cut. the blistering solos on that song alone are worth hearing. the lyrics are excellent as well. it just sounds so grungy. i believe they did grunge in ways better than nirvana. this cd will always hold a special place in my heart along with someone i love so dearly. as i write this it is soon becoming friday.  <br /> <br />  \\"saturday wait. sunday always comes to late but friday never hesitate. i don't care if monday's blue. tuesday's grey and wednesday too. thursday i don't care about you. it's friday i'm in love. i 'm in love.\\"
