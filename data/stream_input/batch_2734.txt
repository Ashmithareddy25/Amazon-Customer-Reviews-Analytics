1419705644|5.0|We were hoping to get an Encyclopaedia that would provide further insight into the world of OOO and all of the when and why the Earth was wrecked and the humans wiped out.<br /><br />Unfortunately this book does nothing to clear that up. There is little to no information consisting in a back story for the land of OOO. So it seems the description on the cover is accurate...<br /><br />Being penned by Hunson Abadeer, the book is designed to confuse the reader. It trys to explain things, but tells us things that we know from the show are not true at all. It is filled with lies and misinformation. We can only assume and hope for a follow up Encyclopaedia penned by some other in-show character that might actually shed some light on the mysteries of OOO which are still mysteries...<br /><br />The book is smaller than expected, for all the work put into making it a great hardcover edition with selective UV coating combined with letter pressing on the cover to give it a cool 3d feel, it could have been at least 7X10 inches which is standard Comic Book size. This book is a bit smaller.

B004SUDQ72|3.0|It appears that many in the audience (at least as represented by reviewers) were prepared to digest the film and fit it into some already prepared cognitive pattern. This was my first film by this team of  creators and I didn't get anything special from it. Thus the rating. I did find it interesting in a twisted sort of way but couldn't get the point....clearly demonstrated by my failure to fit the ending into any meaningful conception related to the movie.<br />For those who might be as ill-prepared as I, there is some reason not to make this your prime  time movie of the night, save it for an adjunct moment. To the others, nothing I can say would be relevant to you.<br />To anyone thinking of buying the DVD, note that it is one of many others in ' 10 Movie Sci-Fi Pack' selling for not much more than Amazon Prime's price for this one alone (about 3-4 dollars difference at this date).

B0024RID6U|5.0|Tattoo You<br /><br />Tattoo You is the best Rolling Stones album since Exile On Main Street.<br />Tattoo You saved rock from puerile pop.<br />I was 14 when Tattoo You was released. My older cousins two years prior rescued me from pop. I still remember telling them that Dynasty by KISS was an excellent album (Laughs). They played Black Dog and Rock and Roll from the fourth Led Zeppelin album and I was hooked.  At that tender age began to love guitar based rock. My older relatives also advised me that the two best bands were Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones.<br /><br />I was devastated when I heard that Bonham died in December, 1980. A year later I was listening to Start Me Up on the radio. ... I was blown away. Zeppelin may have been no more, but the Stones were on fire.<br />.<br />Song Strength<br />The songs on Tattoo You are impressive. Like many I remember tattoo in LP vinyl format. Side 1 has the fast rock numbers and side 2 the ballads. As you can imagine that as a teenager I wore Side 1 out. Hang Fire and Slave are favourites of mine.<br />Tattoo You is an amazing album in that all the songs are strong. Unfortunately, the Stones are a band that do have filler tracks on albums.<br /><br />1, Start Me Up<br />2. Hang Fire<br />3. Slave<br />4. Little T&A<br /><br />Best ever start to Stones album.<br /><br />2 hit singles Stones Formula<br />Unfortunately, by 1981 most people had come across the Stones formula. I know that it upsets die hard Stone fans but history shows us otherwise. It appears that after Exile in Main Street, that the Stones would put the efforts into two killer songs. They would then use their name and substantial resources to milk these songs as singles. Unlike Zeppelin who were anti-singles and completely album driven, the Stones heavily relied on these hit singles.<br /><br />Media and lack of<br />Up until the MTV phenomena of about 1985, the Stones would launch a single from anything up to 3 months prior to the album release date. The single would hopefully chart well and in the case of the Stones very few bombed. The single would push the album into a high chart position. The second single would cement the popularity. You would then have two successful singles, and most importantly a hit album. The rest of the album comprised of filler tracks.<br /><br />Tattoo You<br />I have read some comments were the reviewers claim that Tattoo You is a golden example of this practice. I beg to differ as Tattoo is a great example of every song being worthwhile. In fact two albums either side - Emotional Rescue and Undercover of the Night - were unfortunately prime examples of the two quality songs offset with 6 album fillers. I have NOT included Still Life as it is a live album and therefore a compilation.<br /><br />I love Tattoo You and consider it the last truly great album they made. I don't care that Stones purist claim that it comprises of songs from the previous 10 years that were \\"cast off's.\\" Zeppelin's brilliant Physical Graffiti was the same.<br /><br />5 STARS for what arguably is the Stones greatest last real album that ends the 1968- 1982 period)

B00406O7YK|5.0|The last of the great Hollywood musicals. A very young (26 year old) Barbra Streisand proved she could carry a major movie and hold her own against the likes of Walter Matthau and Micheal Crawford. She was, and is, a supreme talent and this movie gave her a perfect showcase for her unparalleled voice. And her acting and comedic timing are brilliant as well. The choreography is strong, the dancing superbly executed and director Gene Kelly brings his (in)famous perfectionism to bear. I'll never understand why this glorious picture isn't more universally praised. Ignore the naysayers and just enjoy!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Well...I had to read The Book Their for the summer because it was part of my summer reading list. I am going into 9th grade and let me just say this book was beautiful. I have to admit...I wasnt all that into it at forest. Its not the type of book I would read but I am VERY happy that I read it. It takes place during World War II in Germany in the little town of Moulching. I found the character Liesel to be very unique. She was independent but reliant.<br /><br />This book was very good. It is a long book. Being 550 pages long...but if you read 100 pages a day you'll love it. I give this book 5 stars. Just<br />..WOW.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I thought it would be nice to have a dictionary on my kindle, but this is not a good one because I couldn't look up words, only locations.

I will be deleting it from my device if I can. So far it isn't letting me do that, either.

B00DU74U74|4.0|I think too many people looked at this movie through the items of the Twilight movies. Yes, Stephenie Meyer wrote the books for both, but they are very different stories. On its own, The Host deals with an alien invasion being resisted by strong human will, and the kind souls seeking to perfect our world encountering more than they bargained for in Melanie Stryder, who would rather die than be host to one of them, but had the will to live on even after being implanted with Wanderer, an old soul. This story is inspiring in its testament to human will, kindness, understanding, bigotry, and inner growth. It is not an action movie. It is not a romance movie. It is not a monster movie. The special effects are subtle rather than amazing. And that may be why it did not find the commercial success of so many movies that are nowhere near as good.
B000FC130E|4.0|I saw this in the recommended section and thought I would try it. It is a great fantasy adventure read. It lacks some descriptive embellishments, but there is enough detail to envision the story and keep you entertained. The storyline didn't have any noticeably slow points so it was fast and fun to read. I can't wait to explore other Neil Gaiman books after reading this one.

B005723JSQ|4.0|As reviewed on KayFrayBooks<br /><br />Probably one of the top ten most hilarious books I have ever read. Fair warning: You do not want to read this book in public!  I can guarantee that you will be laughing out loud with Poppy and her antics. I love Sam’s reaction to her.  At first he doesn’t know what to make of her, but he knows there is something special about her.<br /><br />Poppy keeps getting stuck in one hilarious situation after another, and most of them are caused by her trying to contain her personality and failing.<br /><br />Poppy’s inner monologue is full of everything people think but don’t want to admit.<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella is great at mixing humor and romance. This isn’t one of those silly love at first sight things, the lead characters actually get to know each other (gasp!). In fact, most of the book is them getting to know each other and eventually falling for each other.  It seems that most books these days take the first 10% of the book to have the character’s fall for each other and the other 90% is spent fighting, having sex, and overcoming odds. That is not the case with I’ve Got Your Number.

140006922X|3.0|[[ASIN:140006922X Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth]] I write this review moments after finishing Zealot. Reza Aslan carried me from one tumultuous chapter to the next, sometimes as I held my breath even though I felt I knew the story of the biblical Jesus quite well. I have followed Reza Aslan for several years, watched him on television, read and thoroughly enjoyed and was educated by \\"No God But God\\". Filled with a certain degree of excitement to see how he would handle his subject, I ordered Zealot. For the most part I give Aslan kudos for the manner in which he lays out the result of his research. It is compelling, very informative, exciting, and engagingly written. As I approached the final chapter, I waited to find out how, in view of all the historical facts Aslan provided in the telling of this tale, he could claim to have embraced Christianity. His explanation that he could admire the man Jesus of Nazareth without stating that he accepted Jesus' divinity as reason for that embrace, didn't seem to square with the historical (factual?) picture of Jesus he'd already painted for the reader. Is he telling us that this historical picture is/was simply a pile of rubbish and we should replace it with Paul's view? Aslan's dedication to his wife and her family is so sweetly touching I suspect his choice of religion has a great deal to do with that. However, I feel his ending to what could have been, should have been, a magnificent book is instead like a balloon pricked by a pin. In other words (almost), much ado about nothing. I'm actually so pained to say this as I greatly admire Aslan. I've been thinking for quite some time that I'd love to take one of his courses; now I don't know that I would. I suppose I would have had more respect for this book if Aslan had not let me know (in view of the book's material) he is a Christian (why would he be inasmuch as he's now enlightened?), or that he had ended the final chapter without mentioning how he personally feels about Jesus. Just for the record, I am a 76 year old woman, raised in the Christian faith but left it years ago for many of the reasons addressed in Zealot.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The mark of Athena is my favorite book because it has all seven of the demigods coming together to fight the giants and I can not wait for book four to come our this fall.<br />The reason I rated the book 5 was that it was the best of all the hero's of Olympus & Percy Jackson books.

Lindsey Stirling has revolutionized dull classical instruments to a fun and spontaneous genre. Highly recommend this album. She has blend her gift with a zest of pop and a bit of awesomeness. Truly revolutionary. If doubtful check her out on youtube before jumping into this fantastic album.

Needless to say I have a hard time keeping up to his scores.  So keep it from your kid or kids....  I love the game and so will anyone else that get's their hands on it.  FYI, if you do download it which you really should because the sound effects and graphic's alone make it worth the while, shut your sound off, it's what attracted my minion which took off with my Kindle!!!  &#60;3 it and so will you.  Can't go wrong.

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|I love the way people are flocking to this historically incorrect book or should I say piece of Agenda Fiction. This guy is the media's darling, not mentioning that he is not a theology or that he's a devout muslim, in their interviews with him, With the media everything Islam is good, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism is Evil.

B0060V1WJ6|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie but wouldn't recommend it for anyone under the age of 16.  It had a little too much nudity and strong sexual content.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I have just started thus game but so far so good,illusive graphics,I just wish the writing wasn't so small, very hard to read.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|After getting into and enjoying the complete FIREFLY series (see seperate review) I had high hopes for this sequel Serenity movie.<br />Have to say it was agonising at the start with really lame script - not the actors, as they all had really BAD self-serving lines, but as I did with the Firefly series, I persevered, and it is as though they changed the script writer, as the movie suddenly improved back to equal the Firefly standard.  Not one of my favorite SciFi movies, but still, ultimately an enjoyable and worthwhile movie.<br />Don't expect any ground breaking SciFi concepts or ideas however.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I had been reading e-books and jumping to different reference materials (white papers, govt reports, etc.) and downloading them for later reading . .. but I wanted to be able to share those and move the PDFs in and out of my cloud drive, etc.<br /><br />ES File Explorer makes it really easy on an old Kindle Fire to grab your downloads and make them documents so they are accessible through the Amazon Cloud for export to other portable drives, etc.<br /><br />That was all I needed and this app suited that need exceptionally well!
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Series came highly recommended as being better than Battlestar Gallactica, but it didnt grab me initially with what I though was a slow and fairly weak start, but I persevered and very pleased I did, as it really got me in and I enjoyed series, being very disappointed with its premature finish.  Maybe the slow start did not capture sufficient fans to ensure a longer survival.<br />But, no - not as good as Battlestar Gallactica, but still well worth getting, but do persevere.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read some of the comments about the readers being upset because it continues, I'm actually glad. I can't get enough of Eva and Cross. I'm very excited to see where they go from here.
B0081336FO|5.0|I love the writing, the acting, the direction, the filming. It's just a very entertaining show. Looking forward to the next season.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|The other ones have been more exciting. Compared to the previous one, I was expected to be blown away. It's a movie worth watching and buying if you're a fan or trying to build a collection but it simply did not meet my expectations.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Okay, so this never happens to me, but this book is a rare case of the movie far exceeding the book. I enjoyed the movie so much, I've seen it twice in the theater. All of the reasons the movie was so good were absent from the novel, however. I made it 85% through until I couldn't take it anymore.<br />For one thing, the witty and supportive relationship Pat and Tiffany share in the movie is completely missing from the book. I have no idea why he would spend time with her based on her novel characterization, she was a selfish b***h the whole time to him. Not to mention, the movie took so baby liberties, most of the movie is absent from the book.<br />The thing that bothered me the most was Pats characterization. Instead of seeming like a guy struggling to make himself healthy, Luke in the movie, the book portrayed him as absolutely delusional, with a seemingly low IQ. I didn't even want to root for him; he sounded like a controlling, abusive partner.<br />All in all, I recommend enjoying the movie and skipping the book.

B005MMJ84K|4.0|The second book in the Delirium trilogy, the story takes place both immediately after the first book ended, and several months into Lena's time in the Wilds. I really liked how each chapter alternated between 'there' and 'now'. It kept the story moving without being dragged down in dull details.<br />Just like Delirium, Pandemonium was written with descriptive, almost lyrical sentences. Although I find the storyline to be very similar to the Matched trilogy, these books offer more than just an interesting plot, and are definitely worth the time.<br />The only problem I have with the series, is that I can't figure out what the essential moral of the stories is. At times the novels seem to be a testament against religion, and other times they seem a testament against atheism. I feel that the plot is implausible in today's America , and is more along the lines of old school communism. Although, I can also see it as a cautionary story against the mood altering drugs that are so freely handed out by doctors. The oneness that does strike home with me though, is the premise that we have worked so hard to make our society 'safe', we are often running scared if what we don't know or understand
B00ATDOVNK|1.0|the game might have been good but I couldn't play it...it looked like the game downloaded but when I would click to play it would start all over again...don't know what happened but it looked like it would have been fun...:(

Learn to respect.<br />Well there is nothing to edit on my 20 words review. But if I may add....I bought the book solely on recommendation of my daughter who believed I would like it cause I have been fighting this from the time I was a kid in my own fashion. Today I am grateful to see in my lifetime that there are women out there to recon with for their intellectual and intelligence poweress along with financial independence. That does not mean our times women were less so. But they were not allowed to be so. Overall intelligence is far from gender based. If men ever thought it to be so they are being proved wrong today. Pray why a woman have to fight to prove their worth and who has given the men folk to judge that, besides what ability do they have to judge? Can they produce a child of their own accord, or, can a women do that either? Inspite of huge advancement in all the technological fields as human beings has there been much advancement in true sense. Not really, not without mutual respect. It is imperative that coexistence in harmony instead of competetion will truly be more fruitful. So if the author and the likes of her who has a ready audience  should give out messages on this line , many will benefit.
3899554698|5.0|I love looking at maps and this book definitely doesn't disappoint! All of them would be worthy to be hung on a wall. Very different kinds of map ideas also, it's a great book. Absolutely coffee-table material.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|Best Karate Kid ever. Good story. Good actors. Funny. Inspiring.everyone needs a friend like mr miyagi. Wax on, wax off!
B0078X2LKY|4.0|Better as a book format because of context. No interaction  but a fun read aloud would share with toddlers and preschoolers.
B0094K20FK|4.0|The second of the Star Trek movies with the original TV cast was done much better the first, Star Trek the Movie.  Plot was good and it did a great job setting the stage for the third movie.<br /><br />The first movie was done like a 1 hour TV show stretched to a 2 hour feature film.
B003RUZKC8|5.0|i saw this movie a while back and i just got it off amazon for a very reasonable price. i didn't even remember that it was only just released in 2010. it was definitely a very good movie if you like your suspense/action/humor all rolled into one. it seemed almost as if it could have been left open for a sequel, but i don't see them doing another one, unfortunately. if you're a chris evans fan, you should like this one.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|You always need and always looking for, and never seem to have when you need it,,, keep the knives sharp, what more could i ask for,, i use it now and then.
B004EPZ070|5.0|i had seen this movie when it came out, but i am not sure why i waited so long to get it. the book was absolutely better, but when is a movie ever better than its book? the actors/actresses chosen for this movie fit their characters well. i even got this for a very reasonable price. amazon is always my go to for movies and cds. they beat the stores every time. if you liked the book, you should still appreciate the movie.
B0089MXRII|4.0|Beautifully recounted memories of a year in the life of a Soviet youth warmed my heart and rekindled forgotten experiences from my own childhood in Poland. Twelve monthly divisions in the book expertly divided the narrative into easily readable parts. Skillful descriptive passages, such as a New Year's party for children in the Kremlin, revived my own memories of happy celebrations provided by the State-run firm of my father. 'Dacha' in the Summer, a story about a child's summer vacation during the Soviet period, would please any sentimentalist. It clearly demonstrated the importance of family and the close relationship between 'Babushka' or grandma and growing children. On a slightly negative note, I would have liked to see the stories unfold in dialogue more than description. I am looking forward to more from Ms Gousseva. Well worth the money at about 10% of the cost of a Starbucks Latte.
B0029LHW68|5.0|i had been planning on getting this cd for a while, so i am very glad that i finally did. this is one of my favorites of their cds, next to their newest of course. some of my favorite tracks are &#34;closer to the edge&#34;, &#34;hurricane&#34;, &#34;this is war&#34;, and &#34;night of the hunter&#34;<br />definitely pleased with this purchase. it even arrived right on the predicted time. i consider myself a #30STM fan, so i will definitely be getting the LOVE LUST FAITH + DREAMS cd.
0425264351|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Lee Child.  This was my first Jack Reacher novel and afterwards, I rushed to the bookstore to buy all the others!<br /><br />As a kid sixty years ago, I loved watching The Lone Ranger get his man.  In much the same way, Jack Reacher is that mystery guy...he comes out of nowhere...prefers to be a loner...with a uncanny ability to solve crimes.  Nothing can stop him...he is humble, yet invincible.<br /><br />If you enjoy watching the \\"good guy\\" win despite overwhelming odds, you'll love this book.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|this cd in my opinion has some of their greater hits. or at least maybe some of their more well known work. i would surly recommend this cd to any One Republic fan.
0525952926|5.0|A great book looking forward to the third one of the trilogy.Ken Follett is wonderful. I have said enough! This is too demanding!
B0083B3KOQ|4.0|I dont usually pay for apps but this one is worth it.  Very well done and makes it easy to convert and renders a high quality conversion.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|subway surf is a very fun and addictive game. there always something going on and lots of new items to collect. I would definatly recommend this game.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I play this game every night it is entertaining and keeps me interested I would like to see time restore diamonds as with your energy and energy not exhausted so quickly but I'll still continue playing every night
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really like minion rush. its cute and challenging. I like the competing with friends feature. more people just need to start playing. I wish there were more achievements to get and that there were more ways to get free coins. but overall its a good family friendly game and it easy for the little ones to play as well
B00A8ECU24|4.0|this game is addictive as coke on steroids. it could run a litter smoother other than that this game is my new so called drug.
B00130UFY2|5.0|These movies to me are always a good watch, even the Renner version was good. You cant go wrong with these.
B009Y61ZMI|2.0|Pretty much a dud, hardly even worth a look even on a boring weekend afternoon. Two stars is the max I would give it.
B0033AGPEE|5.0|This album contains some of the best posthumous Hendrix releases I've heard (and I have them all).  Great vinyl pressing, and wonderful sound.  Highly recommended for Hendrix fans.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|i like this game because it is great for my toddler she loves playing with it and is not violent
B00006LLLN|5.0|I only needed the one song, &#34;DOWN TO THE RIVER TO PRAY&#34;..i absolutely love it!!!<br /><br />recommend this ablum to everyone.
B00CRS88IO|1.0|Where on earth did these good reviews come from?  This was a simplistic comic book take off on the worst of the James Bond movies.  Picture the comic book version of Bond, James Bond, going from death defying combat scene after scene after scene, each one more ridiculous then the next (hopping on a ladder from a moving boat to a helicopter with guns ablazing sort of things).  BUT.....It get's worse.  This \\"author\\" (god help us all) has V2 rockets, jet airplanes, attack helicopters, etc in 1940.....Oh, and forget the weapons.  I simply can not for the life of me imagine any adult reading this book giving it a good review.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I luv all the items in ice age village but I wish they would bring back all the limited and exclusive items and I hope they make a st basics cathedral but I love this app
B008IJT0CE|5.0|My daughter regularly has problems sleeping.  We've started using this to help her, especially when traveling, and it seems to help a lot.  Once asleep, she is not waking with bad dreams, and she falls asleep within under 5 minutes usually.
B009X2CRMK|4.0|Such a good book to snuggle up and read on a winter's day. The characters are endearing and Kate Morton has such a command of descriptive writing that the reader can easily settle into the life and place of the characters. The story line is intriguing, but, for me, looses its way a little towards the end.
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|Great acting and the scenes of the battles looked really real.<br />I've learned a lot about Lincoln that i didn't known before watching<br />this movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love this game so much you can do so much on this app u should get it if u get it ur going to get addicted to it! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0425263916|5.0|I really enjoyed all 3 of Sylvia Day's books from the Cross Fire series. If you really like the steamy sex novels then this is for you. It still has a lot of dominance in it, but I think that is a fantasy that we a desire within ourselves. This couples does have a lot of ups and downs and it does continue thru out all 3 books. But I feel it keeps your mind wondering what's going to happen next. Gideon and Eva are fantasy couple having the fantasy sex that we all want. This will spice up your sex life. My husband loves when I  read these book.:)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Contrary to popular opinion, I did not find this book so fascinating. I read about one third of the book before giving up, as it could not hold my attention.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I've seen several versions of &#34;Emma&#34; and like all of them for different reasons, but bought this one.  I watched it several times on YouTube before committing to purchasing it.  If you're a complete purist, you may not like it, but I loved Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller.  :)
B005R32L66|5.0|This version of Skype is ok! Do not upgrade. The upgraded version in google play doesn't work. Thank you Amazon!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|If I could give this game a 4.9 I would. I am in my early twenties and I love this game. I have spent far too much time on this game. My only issue is that some of the menus have an issue when it comes to scrolling, and they are often formatted weird, with strange edges and images in the wrong layer. That is my /only/ concern with this game. Its not too easy that you get bored, and not so hard that you give up.
0887307280|5.0|A great book for someone in or starting in a small business.  There are key elements to being successful, with great advice for the most often overlooked: managing by the numbers that matter.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I teach middle school and figured I better read these books so I could speak intelligently to my students who are obsessed with them. I ended up reading the entire trilogy in 3 days. They are engaging and entertaining stories.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It is very convenient to keep up to date with local weather to determine my out of doors activities using the Weather Channel for Android (my Kindle)
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is a keeper and actually makes it easier to search for a specific item.  Works well on a Kindle fire 1st gen.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this game. I have almost become addicted to it. If you aren't playing it, why not? Download it!
B003Y5H574|5.0|Best movie. Hysterical. I LOVE Emma Stone she is HYSTERICAL and so cute. Great bunch of actors all together. Thanks.
B0018RC7QE|3.0|Didn't like seeing two marriages fall apart, especially with 2 little kids in the middle. I was looking for light, but falling in love while married to someone else is tough to watch. Takes the delight out of the experience.
B009AMANBA|5.0|The performances by the actors were excellent---all the scenery, furniture, clothing were perfect.  We didn't realize the movie only covered the 13th amendment---it was portrayed so well and was a great selection of events for Lincoln.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|This was your typical Quentin Tarantino movie.  Lots of action and humor, but not for anyone who faints at the sight of blood.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A game where you have to solve puzzles to further the levels. The graphics are great &amp; the ideas behind each level make you have to think. I love this game &amp; will love forward to the next levels to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 4 year old son loves this game!! Perfect when he needs to take a break and calm down. He plays it very well and begs to play it. LOL I just wish you had to put a password in to buy things like coins. He somehow bought $4.99 worth of coins and didn't realize it. I've told him to not buy ANYTHING (even with his coins) but he's 4 so it's going to happen. \\"/ but yes, great game to him!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I still like the book; however, she is prolonging the story too much. I thick she should include less sexy time information.
B00009NQQO|2.0|I purchased this based mostly on cost, so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. But I was still disappointed when we went to take a bath and the suction cups didn't work at all. I'm not sure if it was due to being in the box for too long or what but after multiple tries I cannot get them flat enough to stick to even the smoothest surfaces. Bummer.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was an easy read and very entertaining. I finished it in 3 days. I'd recommend this book to others.
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|Delivery was very prompt. Outward appearance fine, but one of the disks in Season 1 was defective (skipped, got stuck, lost sound, couldn't be forwarded), so we missed part of the story. Disappointing. As we continue to watch the episodes, we are hopeful that there are no more damaged disks. Cannot tell if there is a problem when visually examining them. But we are loving the overall content.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. it's a fast pace game - traveling down the track in Gru's lab avoiding obstacles (some of them move quickly towards you) by switching lanes, jumping over them,  or sliding underneath them. As you're going through the game you collect as many bananas as possible and pushing or running over your fellow minions for bonus points. You also get to use certain weapons or other features that help you get through the obstacles easier or faster or helps collect more bananas at a faster rate. I keep dying in a matter of seconds during the &#34;battling Vector&#34; section. Hopefully I'll get the hang of it and get better and better at it. This game is for all ages - kids and adults.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book. Amazing ending and the same great characters. Riordan knows how to tell a story. Worth the read. For any age.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have this app on all my devices and love having it to glance at weather. When in doubt I use the forecast to look ahead for the week!
B008IJT0CE|2.0|This would be pretty good except the sounds wrap so quickly and obviously.  That becomes quite annoying rather quickly, even if you can normally ignore things pretty well.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Free cloud storage!!!!! I What else could you ask for? It might not be the best at organizing pictures but you get 5 GBs of free storage. It's worth a try.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|i have been looking for a book to read and when i first seen this one i began reading and could not put it down for nothing. i literally finished the book in two days because it was just that good. the plot has you en-captured from beginning to end. Im a book reader and have been looking for a new book for forever and i have found it and im happy its a sequel. Maude and Matt's relationship was believable and not rushed and i cant wait til they finally get together, thats for sure. definitely a great read.
B0050ZPAPA|3.0|If you live long enough, you rack up a fair number of enemies. Atticus O'Sullivan is a 2,100-year-old Druid, and he knows this much to be true - especially since he's had an ongoing tiff with the Celtic God of Love, Aenghus &Oacute;g, for a few centuries now. It's over a sword. And the fact that Atticus isn't as easy to kill as &Oacute;g would like to believe.<br /><br />Luckily for Atticus; Tempe, Arizona has the least number of gods per capita, and for the most part he's left to run his occult bookshop, Third Eye Books and Herbs, in peace. Sure, he has a vampire and alpha werewolf on retainer as his lawyers. He has a wobbly treaty with the local witch coven. And The Morrigan frequently pops in for a visit and foreboding. But for the most part, Atticus is content to blend into this University town and play up his 21-year-old looks and live a quiet life as the last Druid in the world. He's content with his Irish wolfhound companion, Oberon (whom he shares a telepathic link) and to ogle the local bartender beauty, Granuaile.<br /><br />Life is good.<br /><br />And then Aenghus &Oacute;g steps up the attempts on his life. Suddenly there's no one Atticus can trust, and his quiet little life is about to come under threat . . .<br /><br />`Hounded' is the first book in Kevin Hearne's urban fantasy series, `The Iron Druid Chronicles.'<br /><br />This series started back in 2011, and since then Hearne has kept a steady pace of releases - with six `Iron Druid' books currently out, and at least three more in the works. I actually bought `Hounded' when it first came out, based on little more than snatches of the blurb and that fabulous cover. Hearne went on to release three more books in 2011, and I decided to sit back and amass the series a little bit, enjoy the build-up and anticipation before plunging in. It's 2013 now, and I've managed to collect all six books, so now I think it's high time I leapt in . . .<br /><br />These books are funny. That has to be said first of all because when other elements weren't quite working for me, it was Hearne's wit and Atticus's humour that kept me going and ensured I'd be back for more. Atticus was really the saving grace for me in this book, because if his first-person narrative hadn't been so entertaining I'm not sure I'd have been as sold on the world-building promises. But Atticus is a fine hero to go on a journey with (good to know, when I've got six books to spend with him!). He's 2000-years-old, and seen things. He lets little bits of his history show, but as this is the first book Hearne & Atticus are keeping the cards close to their chests - so you'll get a little aside about the Crusades being what turned Atticus off violence, or that his father threw him in a tar pit to teach him to `man up' - but he doesn't dwell on his past and lets very little slip. Sometimes this didn't work for me, but I also loved that Atticus is a character beautifully blended of modernity and history. So occasionally you'll get one-liner gems like his one (discussing Thor);<br /><br />+++<br /><br />. . . in the parlance of our times, he was a douche bag.<br /><br />+++<br /><br />Brilliant. Also adding to the humour in the book is Atticus's trusty Irish wolfhound, Oberon, with whom he shares a telepathic link. Oberon was marvellous, and probably my favourite character ever (someone tell me he's won a sidekick award!). Oberon is poodle-obsessed and very impressionable; one bath-time tale about Genghis Khan and he starts begging Atticus to start a land war in Asia. I also relied on Oberon to bring me back to this series, because he's the one aspect of Atticus's life that hinted a bit at the dearth of his loneliness and revealed his true heart.<br /><br />And that was the thing; Atticus was funny and wise, but throughout the book I felt a disconnect. Here he is, the last Druid. Two thousand years old, the very last of his kind. But I felt like at the end of the book, I didn't really know Atticus all that much andbesides thinking he had a good sense of humour, I wasn't entirely sure I had learnt a whole hell of a lot about him. Now, like I said, this is the first book in a long series so I'd hate for Hearne to lay all his cards on the table. But I wanted to get a sense that we (as readers) were meeting Atticus at the start of this series, at a time when he's ready to reconnect. And I felt there was plenty of opportunity for Hearne to highlight Atticus's loneliness - there's a pack of werewolves, a coven of witches and the gods all seem to be in cahoots . . . but Atticus is on his lonesome. Except he didn't seem all that fussed. Sure, Oberon has clearly filled some of that love and affection for him (because, make no mistake, these two have got `buddy-cop' written all over them) I guess I wanted more evidence that Atticus was ready for more human connections.<br /><br />He is friends with a widowed Irishwoman neighbour, Mrs. MacDonagh, but their bizarre friendship was often used as comic relief as opposed to genuine connection. Then there's barmaid Granuaile, a beautiful red-headed twenty-two-year-old who Atticus can't quite figure out. She's woefully under-cooked in this first book, but looking at the cover for `Trapped', I can guess she becomes a bigger player (drats that it's five books down the queue though).<br /><br />The world-building was pretty good in this book, though I did feel like Hearne was chucking everything in for good measure. In this world, all gods are real - from Allah to Jesus and Buddha. They all exist right now, in some form or other, and for the most part they piss off the little supernatural's with their godly behaviour.<br /><br />This world premise is quite fun, and I can now see why the series has a nine-book trajectory. When no gods are off-limits; every religion, myth and magic could potentially crop up in the books, no wonder Hearne has yet to tap the bottom of the `Iron Druid Chronicles'. Though in this first book he brings out a lot of minor Celtic gods that were hard to keep track of; on top of a brewing witch war, mentions of werewolf pack hierarchy, some Native American tales . . . he put a lot in this first book and at times it was overwhelming, bordering on confusing.<br /><br />I will say that the `Iron Druid Chronicles' are shaping up to be a very manly fare. Maybe when/if Granuaile comes to mean more this will change; but in `Hounded' at least there's no romance, apart from a running joke that three female minor gods fawn over Atticus and there's minor bedroom hijinx that's referenced, not described. The lovey-dovey stuff is minimal and brushed aside quite quickly, which is actually a nice change when paranormal romance has been creeping in and blurring the lines of urban fantasy more and more. But I do hope that, further along in the series, Atticus does look for more in his life and someone to share it with - I think that will go a long way to addressing my initial concerns that Atticus seems to be a very unemotional man.<br /><br />All in all, `Hounded' didn't WOW me like I had hoped it would . . . but I'll be sticking around because (detached as he is) Atticus was a great hero, Oberon is my favourite new side-kick and I'm hoping that future book-covers hint at deeper human connections in store for this lonesome Druid.<br /><br />3.5/5e had a good sense of humour, I wasn't entirely sure I had learnt a whole hell of a lot about him.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Awesome app no problems love it app much definitely addicting and fun to play I look forward to playing it after I get out of work. :)
0756405890|5.0|This is like Harry Potter, but for adults. I know that's only a very basic idea, but I really do believe that it rings true. I grew up on Harry Potter, and now as an adult, this is a fantastic transition.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is amazing you will surely like it. I like how every month there is a new theme and how you can earn coins by just taping the mystery box to spend on hoverboards to new characters or outfits.
B009UZBLSG|1.0|Expensive, yet it can't even charge my phone as im doing something with it on the big screen.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It is a fun game, lots of options and rather addictive.  Takes forever to get pearls though. Other than that, really fun.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The game is highly addictive, but when making in-app purchases via Kindle, sometimes credits paid for are not always given.  Customer Support is not very helpful and sends generic messages about them knowing of the technical errors, but never fixes it.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|This book was a part of my AP English required summer reading and I'm so glad it was because I don't think I would have ever picked it up. It's long, so very long, but not once did I ever dread it. I have never thoroughly read a story for school.. I just kind of read it and didn't bother reading in between and behind and on top and all around the lines.<br /><br />Books don't make me cry often, but the characters were just so..well developed that I couldn't help feeling pain when they felt it.John Steinbeck..you are truly amazing.<br /><br />I don't know who to recommend this to.. I feel like everyone can relate to this book.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I personally felt this book was overrated especially when I looked back after reading it and saw it had received 4+ stars. First and foremost the  book starts off a bit slow and didnt begin to gain traction in the story until about the 3rd or 4th chapter. I almost put it down for good but I didnt want to waste my money based on claims it was actually enjoyable. So  I gave it another look and later it started to grow on me.  It had a strong descriptive character with roots. ALthough it was a 7 year old boy with the adults not playing much of a role in the story outside of the Helmstock women. The rest of the character's  were not so easy to get to know and understand. They seemed like ghosts in the story that would show up when needed. You would read about them, but it felt like too many of them were inconsequential and unimpactful placeholders i.e  the sister and mother. I wouldnt give the book more than threes star even though I thought the writing was good. The story however was short and had gaps in the storytelling. It had the feel like it had been published in a rush just to get something out there. With a lot of the bones of the story seeming to be  edited out. The Helmstock's also were quite an enigma, they were enchanting and mystical but other than them cooking and conjuring up word spells they were a bit of an empty vessel throughout the story. And the mythical creatures they called  vermin and fleas their world and origin needed to be further explained beyond the 2 or less paragraph given to the substance and explanation of it all.<br /><br />The ending of the story was also quite flat and didnt read like it had reconciled the hanging edges left from the plot at all. I would consider the book ok but not great. Honestly its not an adult book and should not be marketed that way. Reading about a elementary school age kids falling into trouble with fantasy creatures with an ocean at the end of the pond. Was like reading something 3 grades below a Harry Potterfirst installment. It definitely was imaginative and a read that I will remember. But it was more like  a book I had  read at 13 instead of 25. And reminded me of the short story collections I read when I was young and not the adult  of fantasy fiction I  yearned for. At a kindle price of $9+ dollars. Honestly I felt a bit cheated and would of paid no more than $5..
B005T87QCI|4.0|I will never give a game 5 stars because no game is perfect. This game is so epic I was tempted to give it 5. The graphics are awesome, the gameplay aspect is spectacular, and its all based upon one of the best movies of our time.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|This game is the most enjoyable and fun game I have played in a long time. I sometimes found myself laughing as I played. The guys who programmed it did a great job.<br />You find yourself on a swap fan boat moving through the swamps and tunnels going from town to town. The object of the game is to pick-up money bags in the swamp. Then when you reach town buy or sell different commodities such as moonshine,gator tails and other items(like in the stock market) to make more money. What is really fun in this game is that it is very forgiving. If you hit the walls or buildings while traveling they break apart or you bounce back into the river. I hit so many gators and boats(police boats, too!), that I literally destroyed all the river life. Another nice thing is that if you get in a position where you can't get out or loose. There is a reset button that places you right and ready to continue on down the river. I couldn't stop playing this game. (Only one complaint, wish they had a few more towns). I believe anyone playing this game will have a great time. Moms and Dads, this is a great game for kids. It has a low learning curve and will teach your kids about using money.<br />But, as for me, I just couldn't stop laughing.<br />Boy, you hav a perty boat!!!
159463176X|5.0|This book has so many reviews that i do not think i can add anything. seems that all has been said and written.<br />This is my type of book. Most of all i like books with characters-minor or major, young or old, happy and unhappy.<br />I love characters. I love diversity.<br />And i love reading about human destinies.<br />Distance is no burden.<br />Hope is helpful.<br />Love is always the answer.<br /><br />\\"And the Mountains Echoed\\" was a real trip for me. A trip through life. i am young, but i feel that this book gave me years of experience and lots of wisdom.<br />I recommend this to just everyone.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I loved everything about this movie. It kept my attention from the first frame and the twist at the end was expected, but emotionally beautiful just the same. The two played off each other wonderfully and I hope they continue to do movies together.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Loved it!!! Couldn't put it down, one of the best book I have ever read. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time!
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|The app doesn't even work which seems to be a pretty typical problem on the Kindle Fire HD. Save your money
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Game is fun and addictive.  Graphics are clear and good, not a lot of options, but really not necessary.  If you like free cell you will enjoy this app.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|My six year old niece really enjoyed this game.  Especially the hair dryer she used to make the hair stand up straight.  She had fun with the different colors and haircutting.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Every author has a purpose writing, an explicit or hidden agenda. The Iranian-American author Reza Aslan (1973) introduces himself as having found Jesus Christ on a youth camp when he was 15. As soon as he began studying, he abandoned his faith in Jesus as only begotten Son of God, Christ and one you can have a personal relationship with. Though not revealed in this book, it's no secret, that the author is a practicing Shia Muslim. Core to the Islamic creed is a god without a son, so it shouldn't be surprising the reader, that a cut-off between Jesus and his heavenly Father, is Aslan's paradigm.<br />According to the author the result of 20 years of research was laid down in Zealot - The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth. Given his age, not all research can be his own. Some reviewers even doubt whether he actually has written the book himself. I'll leave that question for the author to answer. In my opinion Aslan, author of the internationally bestseller No god but God compiled a fascinating, provocative, and meticulously researched biography that challenges long-held assumptions about the man many know as Jesus of Nazareth.<br />As a myth buster Aslan confronts the reader with difficulties on his birthplace (Bethlehem), cousin / herald John the Baptist, workmanship, message (did or didn't he reveal himself as Messiah, God's Son, King of the Jews? What were his aspirations? What is the Kingdom of the heavens/God.. all about?), quotation from the Tenach, prophesies about the Christ, Jesus' \\"crime\\", death, and resurrection. Crucial is the concept of being \\"zealous\\", the jealous anger that YHWH already showed when He gave Moses the Ten Commandments. And no, Aslan doesn't make Jesus a Zealot, since that party simply didn't exist during Jesus' life.<br />In the second part he devotes a lot of attention to the division between the Jewish followers of Jesus, headed by James the Just, Jesus' brother, Peter, and the gentile converts by the ministry of Paul, portrayed as zealous too, but wandering away from his Jewish former belief system. And to put it mildly, Aslan's no friend of Paul. Skip 200 years and you're watching the bishops of this new religion shape the canon of the New Testament and declare a creed in Nicea that prefers a distance from the historical Jewish Jesus, zealous for the Kingdom of God, and a God became man, died for our sins, was risen by God and restored glory again. a peaceful spiritual teacher . And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity.<br />By telling and quoting a lot (the remaining 30% of the book contains notes), emphasizing the errors made by fellow humans, it's easy to forget the balk in your own eyes. Aslan reduces Christ's revelations to a messianic secret, which only hints, not reveals. Nowhere the nature, activities and influence of the Church is mentioned. Acts 2, Hebrews and epistles from Peter, John's Revelations, are `forgotten'. His ethics and Beatitudes, which the gnostics need so much, don't get attention, neither do concepts like sin, punishment, atonement and redemption. What remains is a good man with a message and a goal, to bring freedom, a message worth believing in, but no more. A concept that perfectly matches an Islamic point of view: you can't ignore that Jesus actually existed, but his followers really messed things up.alous too, but wandering away from his Jewish former belief system.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My six year old niece and I took turns to see which of us could get further into the game.  Lots of fun and laughs.  We played the game over an hour.  I think we are hooked on the Minions.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This was a story of Mitch Rapp in his later years and was up to Vince Flynn's standards of a mesmerizing theme and excitement throughout the book.  I will really miss this fine author as he has provided me with many hours of enjoyment.  I still have a few Flynn books that I haven't read so will look forward to them in the future.  This book was about a kidnapped agent who was privy to many secrets including the names of other secret agents thus making it urgent that Rapp find him quickly.  It takes place in Pakistan so is very current in subject.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Who knew they made a movie and my son and I (well, not exactly).  Great movie.  Sad, happy and thought provoking.  It was wonderful seeing Barbara Streisand in this movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Use it daily and on trips. Works great and provides all the info I need to plan for the day or week.
B000ICL3CO|5.0|Had this album many years ago (first on cassette and then cd) but unfortunately had lost much of my music collection in a flood.  A must have album for any Cure fan.  I am truly happy for (re)acquiring what I consider one of their better albums.
B0086700CM|4.0|I loved this game. I played it all the time. then I got temple run 2. I haven't plaid it since. so if you want to get temple run 2 don't even bother getting this. but over all this is 1 of my fav games
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|Purchased this movie for my son who loves both LEGOs and Comic Books. Fun movie enjoyed by the entire family. Unless cartoons and comics are not your thing, I would highly recommend.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I love this game because it it so addictive .Plus I LOVE HELLO KITTY.She is so cute.I love the different restaurant options,table decorations and chair decorations
B004ZNB12O|5.0|As much music Pink Floyd has out there, the only way encompass them entirely would be through the purchase of all their albums (or buy the box set in one shot).  This album, however, is a nice collection of some of their more popular songs.  Although I have enjoyed their many albums, I will have to say that this album is a safe bet for fans of old and for those who may be interested in what Floyd has to offer. A definite favorite in the car.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have always wanted to read this book when I finally got the chance I absorbed every bit it. The thought of what it is like to live with cancer or anything like it intrigued me. This book answered all my questions.<br />Jess age 12
B005GG0MIS|4.0|This an excellent in sight into the Presidency of our 20th century presidents and in particular their life after their days in office. The personal profiles was illuminating. A good read.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|No issues with disc or case. Both disc and case were in great condition. Disc works perfectly. Would order again.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I looked forward to reading another book by this author. The Kindle sample had the introductory story and a reader could read that and have an excellent idea what the story line is. I found his writing very detailed and tedious. I kept reading it hoping I would be finished soon.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|Movie is super slow but not in a suspenseful way.  It gets a bit more interesting at the end but certainly not enough to warrant sitting there for 1:45 minutes.  Unrealistic to the extreme.  And not at all what I thought it would be about plot-wise.  Its like they realized it was bad and made an ad campaign to purposely mislead.
B0029LCJJS|2.0|This was not at all what I had expected. With a name like the Tudors, imo it just did not fit.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Bought this for my brother who is a history buff. He loves this series and i watched a few episodes with him and actually got into it. Very well acted not sure how accurate the show is to real life but entertaining none the less.
B000FC146C|5.0|I saw the movie years ago and would like to see it again to find out how far it strayed from the book.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Cute little critters with really cool game play. I can't seem to put it down. It's awesome how they look geometric and stuff
B00BSBX9TE|5.0|This was the second time I read this book and it was even better the second time round.<br />Will recommend as a great read.
B000JMKOI2|4.0|Bukowski is great at describing his gritty L.A. lifestyle.  He writes in a such a way that you really feel like you know him after you read his books.
B0058O84G0|5.0|I loved this book and was kept spellbound to the end.<br />Love this authors storytelling ability and his style of writing.
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|As much as i admire and love Rod, i found that all those big band albums took him away from me.They were good but it is not what I associated Rod Stewart with. During those years, i missed his brave songwriting and his bold performances. Rod is one of the best rock singers of the last 5 decades and I found he had gone to some foreign land and left his die hard fans behind. With this album, i find Rod is back to what he does best: singing what he writes. From \\" She Makes me happy\\" to \\"It's Over\\" i see he has bounced back to his style of the 70s.I am glad and i welcome him back where he belongs.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|This book has no story line whatsoever.  I was disappointed after all the hype around this book and will not recommend it.
0618918248|5.0|Anyone can find a reason to dislike Richard Dawkins, but I think he's the most articulate expositor of evolution and atheism.
B001AKTZPK|5.0|A must have for CCR fans...title song and &#34;It Came Out of the Sky&#34; especially. So glad I bought this one
0800141806|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite movies every. The ending is sad but the acting is amazing. My wife and I love this movie. Denzel and Tom Hanks both gave great performance.
B00845MRKE|5.0|1) Blade Runner is one of the most genious film about future?<br />2) First the new track is marvellous<br />3) Then the picture is incredible
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Don't rent or buy unless you are a big Denzel Washington fan. He can make bad scripts watchable. DW pulls this one along by the strength of his acting. John Goodman, is just this side of slap stick,  I'm not really sure that's what the director was trying to convey..

1616551607|5.0|I will try to make this short and sweet.  Amazing!  I have been waiting for this to come out forever and it finally arrived.  I knew it would be good but this is deffinately the classiest set of books I have ever purchased.  They went above and beyond with this thing.  Not only are the books and contents inside them beautiful and wonderfully crafted, the case they come in is of the same quality.  Not just some throw-away cardboard box but a piece of art itself.  Buy it while you still can.  What you'll get is worth many times more what you'll spend.
0810994739|5.0|My 8-year-old son could not drag himself away from this book (or from the others in the series).<br /><br />From my son:<br />This book is really good. As in all of the books, Manny is always messing stuff up and he never gets in trouble. I also like what Rodrick does. This is the book where he gets HIS stage time.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great Production quality. Great acting. Great surprises.<br /><br />This series is among the best on television. Keep in mind that it is a mature show. Great drama.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My granddaughter &amp; I love playing this game together! She likes the fish, and learning about the new sea creatures that become a part of your reef. Some people complain that you have to spend money to advance in the game, this isn't true.  You can choose to spend money to advance faster in the game, but you don't have to spend money.
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|Your Bowling for Movies Score: 128.25 of 300<br /><br />I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.<br /><br />Snow White and The Huntsman - we own the Blu Ray, DVD, Digital Copy, and Ultraviolet \\"Extended Edition\\"<br /><br />Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):<br />Not your great-great-great gandfather's fairytale - retold, rebooted, reworked, re-engineered, and reimagined once for children, now for teens epic story following the harrowing tale of a depressed and moody, soon to be thrust into greatness Princess Bella, er, I mean Snow White (Kristen Stewart), as she takes flight from imprisonment by her evil stepmother, Mr. F, I mean Ravenna (Charlize Theron) and is first hunted by and then assisted by hunky axe wielding super-hero Thor, er, Eric The Huntsman, just Huntsman to his friends (Chris Hemsworth).  I would be found wanting if I didn't mention the once noble gem and precious metal miners, turned highway robbers better known as the seven dwarves lead by Black Beard himself, DBA Beith (Ian MacShane).<br /><br />Overall, this movie made me sad... it had real potential and was simply undone by uneven acting.  I liked the story, I liked the CGI, I liked the epic scale, heck - I even think there was some genuinely good acting.  You can read plenty of complaints about Kristen Stewart's poor performance.  The fact that she won both The Teen Choice Award aaand a Golden Raspberry is positive evidence of why we don't hold teens legally responsible and seal their records once they become adults.  If her flat, lifeless acting doesn't get you - the fact that she goes cockeyed every time she goes in for a kiss really should.  Charlize Theron helped every step of the way with her over-the-top portrayal of Ravenna, the evil stepmother.  I had to sit and ponder other reviewers positive take on Charlize and I finally had to just to realize that the writers must have forgotten a few letters when describing her as mesmerizing and operatic...  what I witnessed was indeed mesmerizing(ly bad) and (needlessly) operatic.  I saw some great acting - Sam Spruell did a wonderful job as Finn, Ravenna's brother and according to my wife, Chris Hemsworth's fancy fighting really inspired her.  She said he had the nicest ax she's seen in quite sometime (I didn't even know she liked wood chopping implements).  At the end of the day, I can forgive the casting of Stewart - hey, they are trying to cash in on Twilight fans between movies, I get that.  I cannot forgive the mistakes made by the casting and directing of Charlize Theron.  Ok movie dude - if you didn't already own it, would you buy this movie?  The answer, yes (if it was on sale).  :]<br /><br />What I loved:<br />1.  It's a good reboot - the additions to the beloved fairytale were spot on and made sense<br />2.  It's beautiful to behold - the scene with The Great White Stag was awe-inspiring to name just one<br />3.  It was refreshing to see something other than just a comic book hero in their 12th reboot on the screen... how many times can we watch Spiderman or Superman on the screen  (if you build a better movie, they will come)<br />4.  Gives a perfect example of why you only eat mushrooms from the grocery store and not pick your own at the park... wow, every so often I breath in a piece of lint and that's bad but nothing compared to the mushroom spores in this movie<br /><br />What I did NOT like:<br />1.  If this is a German fairytale why is Kristen Stewart breaking in and out of an English accent thru the entire thing?<br />2.  Did I mention Kristen Stewart?<br />3.  Charlize Theron (did I mention Kristen Stewart?)<br /><br />I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews.

B00CL68BK2|5.0|I thought this was a sincere and funny story about a guy putting his life back together.  I thought it was instructive of what many families go through with an adult loved one who has mental illness
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Don't miss this CD. Rodriguez finally is getting the notice he deserves. His music is unique and is the equal of any artist of the time.
B000002G7G|5.0|It hadn't been long since I discovered these guys so I was a bit iffy about buying the album but now I can say I have no regrets.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|The CD that made Rodriguez famous in South Africa.  Great songwriting, great vocals, great music.  Don't miss this one - it's a solid winner.

B003B02PF4|4.0|GreAt read<br />But I skipped a lot of scenery fluff.  Clock and dagger and  politics and Washington dc fighting amongst themselves
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A five star fairy tale that I could not put down. The only regrettable  thing about this book is that it ends. The characters and the story take a life all their own in your head. I must say I could not get enough about the Hempstocks and would love a book for just them. What a wonderful story, it will be one that I reread, just like all my other Gaiman books. <3
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|If you have been BURNT by love, this movie is for you. A MUST SEE MOVIE. Where is your silver lining?
B00003003R|5.0|Review number 230. I do realize that I'm umpteen years late with getting this live Guns N' Roses 2-CD piece but I see that it was initially put out in the late '90's. At that time, I was going through a progress / space rock / krautrock phase - so that is likely one of the various reason(s) that I never got this must-own live Guns N' Roses audio keepsake 'Live Era '87 - '93'. Plus the fact that I barely even remember it seeing it in stores. I've said this before - but there are simply too many ~new~ CD's coming out on a weekly / monthly basis to keep track of anymore. What inspired me to get this title was that here - recently, I saw Guns N' Roses play live as I also saw them less than two years ago (actually, it was Axl Rose with a back-up band). Still a great was had by all. I probably enjoyed disc one a bit more so than disc two - but rest assure - it's all good to thoroughly take in. Worthy of [most] repeated spins in your home entertainment center are the awesome shindig opener \\"Nightrain\\", \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", (maybe the '80's hard rock anthem) \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", love story-turned-tragedy \\"Used To Love Her\\", their mega-ballad and tear-jerker \\"Patience\\", the heartfelt \\"Yesterdays\\", \\"You Could Be Mine\\", \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\", their beautifully played cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" and the powerfully finale \\"Paradise City\\". Comes with an irreplaceable sixteen-page full-color CD booklet. Highly recommended.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|One of the best games I have ever played. I would definitely recommend this game to all kids and all people that play farmville.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so AWSOME! Love Love this game. Would so recommend this game to others and friends. Super addicting
B00873GRU4|5.0|Only after reading the trilogy as a single volume did I discover that that the story was made op of several volumes. However, reading it all at once was very satisfying and I like novels that makes you think. I would recommend it.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Best album since Empire. Tate obviously needed Queensryche more than they needed him! Reminds me of a modern Rage for Order. Job well done.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|You have to read the final book of this trilogy! Only way to find out if all turns out the way you want it to! Are they finally freed? Read it to find out, whatever you do don't leave this one out!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|A annual Christmas traditional to place the family in the spirit of the season. Have to have the blu-ray version. Classic.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Even tho there were a couple of things that broke my heart in this season, it is still a show I never want to miss. I am officially obsessed.
0345308239|4.0|An interesting, entertaining, enjoyable read. What do men really know? We are expected to act whether we know or not. I think discussion of some of the motivating forces as to why habits persist and what it is men are trying to avoid by acting rashly and greedily would enlighten this topic further.
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|I really didn't care for the current version.  Friends told me they really loved the 1974 version, so I purchased it.  Wonderful film.  Not perfect--I didn't care for Mia Farrow's portrayal of Daisy, but Robert Redford is perfect as Jay Gatsby.  Beautifully photographed.  Not as &#34;frantic&#34; as the new version.  The music was accurate and added to the enjoyment of the film.  Highly recommend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 4 year old like playing together. many fun things to do - Feed; pet; compete; clean up; etc. hours of fun

B00936A0RU|2.0|But the film leaves a lot to be desired, at least the period cars, and buildings and street scenes were pretty good.....
B00821OX98|4.0|Heard a lot about this show but never watched one episode for the longest time. Once I started watching this, I just can't stop. Each episode gets you more hooked up and you have to know what comes next. Most episodes have great story line and cg effects are great for a tv show. Definitely recommends this show for any sci-fi fan.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Big fan of the original films and this did not disappoint. Lost of blood! Effects were great. Much darker than the original.

B0047Y17P2|4.0|Once again, Michael takes us into the courtroom.  He HAS to have been there, as he knows all the little things that go on in the background during a trial.  These legal thrillers from Connelly bring me in mind of a great TV series, as we watch Mickey Haller work his way through a murder trial, with defendent Lisa Trammel being railroaded due to a spec of blood on some garden shoes in her unlocked garage as being the only irrefutable evidence in the case.  Lisa also seemed to have motive and opportunity, with the murder victim being the head of a group that foreclosed on her house and against which she formed an organized protest.  As usual, the twists and turns create exciting reading until the bittersweet ending to this novel.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I LOVED how different this book was from anything else that I have read lately!!  Emma Chase nailed the mail perspective, and I can't wait to read more from her.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I purchased this because I liked one of the songs and it turned out I love the entire album. I would highly recommend it. It Rocks!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Just what I was looking for . Very ideal at a great price in comparison to other options.<br />I love it

B00CXQL828|5.0|Let me keep this short and sweet.  Great Line up. Tasteful and outrageous Musicianship. Solid Songs.  If you are going to buy music this year, this is the ONE.  A modern day Rock album. Thank you, thank you, thank you gentlemen.  Well done.

159463176X|4.0|I think I am one of the few readers on the planet who has not read Khaled Hosseini's previous works - The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. With the release of his third novel, And The Mountains Echoed, I thought it was time to sample this best selling author.<br /><br /> And the Mountains Echoed opens in 1952 with an Afghani father telling his son and daughter a fable -  the story of a parent's love for his child, fighting off a div (ogre) who claims children from their village. The father loses one of his children to the div, but cannot stop thinking about him. After many years, the father goes to the div's palace to reclaim his son, but the child is now living a life of privilege and happiness. The div offers the father the chance to reclaim his child, but does he really want to take him back to a life of poverty and hardship?<br /><br /> \\"You are a cruel beast, Baba Ayub said. When you have lived as long as I have, the div replied, you find that cruelty and benevolence are but shades of the same color.\\"<br /><br /> And that fable sets the stage for the rest of the book. In the next chapter, the storytelling father sells his daughter to a wealthy family, separating his son and daughter. They have shared an incredible bond in their short lives. Is that bond every truly broken? Can the echoes of their love follow them and stay with them?<br /><br /> Hosseini takes us on a wide, sweeping, encompassing journey touching on all who play a part or touch the lives of the two children - from childhood to old age. As it's base the story is about the two children, but Hosseini builds wonderfully rich tales around many of the other characters. In that sense, the book has many lead characters, spanning countries and time lines. (I have to say, one of my personal favourites was Odelia, one character's Greek mother. Her sense of right and purpose was inspiring.) At least one character in And The Mountains Echoed will touch or stand out for every reader.  Not every character is sympathetic, but all elicit a reaction.<br /><br /> The narrative often skips from one character to another and from one time period to another. I did find myself having to reestablish who was who and the connections a few times. Some threads are left unfinished and I was left wondering what might have happened to some players. Although, that certainly may have been Hosseini's intent. Each story leaves an impression or an echo on the next, stringing a thread of connectedness between all.cter is sympathetic, but all elicit a reaction.<br /><br /> The narrative often skips from one character to another and from one time period to another.

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I never expected to fall head over heels with this film but I did.  Having seen the original and subsequent stage versions many times over the years, I was both terrified and energized by the prospect of the film.  But I was simply unprepared for the film's eloquence or depth, which for me at least, made the material feel fresh and contemporary even though the words are hundreds of years old.  I practically steeled myself when The DVD arrived thinking I would need to set aside plenty of time for it, though not really knowing why.<br /><br />Over the course of several days, I watched in spurts and starts, at first unable to get thru Anne Hathaway's heartbreaking death sequence.  Nothing I'd heard or read prepared me fully for Hathaway's brilliant turn.  No wonder she won an Oscar.  Well.  Duh. For me, the movie transformed itself into a great film at the 33 minute mark.  By the time Fantine had sung her last note (in this act, anyway) I was a wreck, had tears streaming down my grown men's beard-stubbly face and was practically gasping for air.  Anne Hathaway gives unquestionably one of THE towering film performances ever and earns her place in the cinema hall of fame, no doubt.  Her performance is THAT good and worth the price of admission in and of itself.  She knocked the wind out of me, so I paused, and took a day off before trying a second and third time, but each and every time, Fantine's scenes devastated me to the point where I couldn't fathom getting thru the rest of it!<br /><br />About a week later, I finally succumbed to its magical pull and watched Les Miz from start to finish.  And I came away seeing the film as an incredibly well-realized adaptation of a beloved stage musical.  As a film, it is one for the ages.  Hugh Jackman is the ultimate Jean Valjean in terms of combining sheer brute presence and a powerful made for Broadway voice.  I saw Jackman as Peter Allen on Broadway in his Tony winning turn as The Boy From Oz, so I expected great things fromthis ace of actors, someone who can do anything!  And Hugh did not disappoint!  With the one exception of &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; which is simply too high for Jackman - or almost any man other than maybe Adam Levine - to sing perfectly, I felt he nailed the richness and sublime instincts of his character. Jackmans Valjean is desperate in his rebellion and earnest in his redemption, but always willing to take the risks that make him - and all of us - human,  No actor has come close to capturing Valjean in as 3-dimensional a way as Hugh Jackman, and in any other year without Daniel Day Lewis, Jackman would have easily won an Oscar for this portrayal.<br /><br />The supporting cast is equally solid, even Helena Bonham Carter and Sasha Baron Cohen as the dingbat Masters of the House.  Amanda Syfrid and Samantha Barks were stunningly lovely, while Aaron Tvitt (a remarkable young singer I saw in the heartbreaking and real &#34;Next to Normal&#34;) makes an indelible impression again as he does on stage.  Watch this kid...he will be huge!  Lastly, Eddie Redmayne is a superstar in the making and will be a serious Oscar contender in the future!<br /><br />Much has been said about this movie, good and bad.  I get it.  It's a film that's wrapped in heated debate because so many millions of people have been touched by its sorrowful tale of redemption and honor and love.  At the end of the day, its a movie.  And it happens to be a GREAT one once you get all those critical voices - both pro and con - out of your head.  Watch it and see if it doesn't move you and touch your heart.  That's what a great movie is about, and that's my experience with Lez Miz..A wonderful surprise!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|A wonderful, classic story.  Oddly, It was my first time of reading this book. It Has a great sense of humour.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Ang Lee rocks.<br />The remarkable Taiwanese director adds the crown jewel in an already lifetime-hall-of-fame-worthy arsenal of brilliant films (Crouching Tiger, The Ice Storm, the Wedding Banquet, Eat Drink Man Woman, Sense and Sensibility, Brokeback Mountain...I mean, really....what can Ang Lee NOT do?).  No other living director - and very few ever - comes close to the vision Lee delivers with Life of Pi.  From the indelible images of animals in a zoo that flood our field of vision over the opening credits to its final moments in a questionable raft riding rough pounding seas, the maestro creates a singular unified story for the ages...and all ages too.  Hard to imagine as a novel I never read, the book was not expected to yield such a bounty of sheer beauty and natural punch, but holy cow, it does!  Its a blockbuster And then some.  Even on DVD.  Pi is the sort of film that should be on permanent display once a week at least at a theater near you.
0985557834|5.0|This book is the home run follow up to JD Lenzens' Fusion Ties Vol.1.This book picks up where Fusion Ties Vol.1 left off with lots of new ties and patterns AND an introduction to making pouches and other types of useful projects.I can't recommend this book highly enough!I bought the paperback and the Kindle version just so I have a copy with me wherever I go!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As an IT professional I've setup and troubleshot just about every kind of device imaginable.  I've got an Apple TV, but for $35 I figured I might as well explore what Google was bringing to the table.  I cannot recall an easier setup up.  Af first I tested by plugging it into my 3 year old LG TV, the provided USB cable and tether makes it easy to connect neatly to two ports, if your sets HDMI ports don't provided the needed power.  Downloaded the setup app to my Mac and I did the 2 minute (if that long) configuration there.  Ultimately I moved it to a port on my Bose home theatre system for maximum effect.  Add an extension to Chrome on the Mac and voila you're set.  Now YouTube has an option where to display the output, select Chromecast and it's playing now from another tab as I type this review.  Switching to the YouTube app on my iPhone and was just  as easy.  I would imagine this will be true of en Chromecast enabled service.  You can even project any webpage, so for example set Flickr to do a slide show of your photos, then use the browser extension to display on your TV.  For $35 I'm not sure how you can go wrong.
B008GJV2OA|5.0|This is one of the funniest I have every seen. It possibly has a little stereotypical but funny. they don't make movies like that anymore
B00BJKZVRC|5.0|You get both the stereo and 5.1 mix to listen to and I must admit it sounds stellar on an excellent sound system. I'm using an Oppo BDP-103 to play and have been very happy with the results!
B006ZNRD06|2.0|I am sure its fine but does not work on my Kindle fire HD, so there is not much to like!!
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|I've listened to this CD countless times. It's very powerful. It conjures up images of the movie so that it almost feels like I'm a part of it. Very moving. I just wish it was longer because I would have enjoyed even more scores.
B0067TQQI8|1.0|the item won't charge the day i started using it the first thing i did was to drain the battery by charging my iphone after that when i charged it after around 20mins its stopped charging. when i pressed the power it shows three LED lights only when i tried charging my phone from 4% it stopped charging  at 25% then it shows that the unit is out of battery. i charged it again ovrnight still the same results showed. its broken the moment i received it
B008OOYALE|5.0|Easy to play, somewhat addicting, and really pretty in the process.  Best part of this Lava brand game is that nothing goes bad if you are away from the game for a while, unlike Bakery Story or the other Stories.  Just don't expect a scientific calculation for what breeds at what ages will get what dragons, a lot of it is random.  For example, if you breed a green dragon and a diamond dragon, you might get a special rare dragon or maybe just another green - over and over again.  It can drive you nuts!  But its still a fun game.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Completely unhappy about the &#34;ending&#34;!!!! Have no desire to read the next!! Wish I would not have spent my money on this book even though I loved the first two.
B000IOEQ1M|2.0|The book that i ordered was Nimitz Class.  it was to be in good condition.  This is not the book that was shipped.  The book was mismarked and was labeled Nimitz Class.  i decided to keep the book based on the cost but was disapointed.  i have not yet reordered Nimitz Class but plan to.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|PKD is one of my all time favorite authors<br /><br />Fantastic sci fi classic<br /><br />Great story and the basis for bladerunner<br /><br />No more to say!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I am giving this game 4 stars because I found the game to be just beautiful.  The details were amazing and I kept exploring the room to see the rest of the details.<br /><br />The reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I wished it was longer.  I finished it in a couple of hours and haven't come back to it since.  The story didn't make much sense to me and the ending didn't give me any closure.  I finished the game with a 'What? That was it?'  Maybe it had a deeper meaning to the story or maybe I am not bright enough to understand it, but it was just.. bizarre.<br /><br />Mind you, the game play was great and the puzzles weren't as easy as I had thought they were going to be.  Because of those reasons, I really enjoyed the game and I recommend it to anyone that likes beautiful games and great puzzles.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this is wonderful for ages. The graphics are amazing! I WANT A UNICORN! It's to expensive though :(
B0050DIWFC|5.0|kept my attention-good descriptive writing-characters were complex and realistic-made me feel like I was in the courtroom during the trial scenes
0553801473|5.0|G.R.R. Martin definitely clears up most of what is missing from feast for crows. I cant wait to read the next one!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|It is a very good three matching game. But it is costly, in order to do more advanced levels. Otherwise, it's lot's of fun
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love these movies they are so cool good thing they were on sale on blu ray 5 stars yea
B0036BK6MW|5.0|If you have a heart you will enjoy this movie. it's about choosing family regardless of what has happen in the past even if they are not blood.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Is very fun and entertaining. I recommend it especially if you love horses or just want to pass time. Great app and wonderful images.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's  amazing! I love how its so easy, and all the different characters. I love all the characters. So much fun.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next, but didn't like the type of people they represented. Good book club book.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|I enjoyed gangstar Rio but could never actually get into it because of some poor controls that the kindle isn't capable of l. Thank God for this it is amazing dare I say the best game I've played on the kindle this game has a good sized campaign which took me about 8 hours to complete and there is still so so much to do after the campaign you owe it to your self to get this game if you enjoyed gangster Rio
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved the way the author made me see and feel exactly what Pi was going through. He is a very real character that I can relate to. The ending is perfect and I will read this book over and over again
B00CLT31D6|5.0|This book gave me a great view of how real millionaires build real wealth.  It's helpful to form how I can do this for myself.
B0085OF4GS|2.0|Love Val Kilmer.. but not in this movie. It was a little too Mel brooks for me. I enjoy a good pun with everyone else, but war humor is not one of them. Maybe if it had been in a different setting...
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a great read. I downloaded it on my kindle, not having heard anything about it. I could not put it down. I told a couple of friends and they had the same experience. It'd be great for a book club read.
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|Cher's concert is great! I have not seen another show even come close. Love the costumes, love the songs. Love Cher!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game was awesome for me to play...... I LOVE THE MINIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The game does charge a lot for new minions
B008220DGE|3.0|i found the movie simply unremarkable and unmemorable.  as other reviewers indicate, its a character first movie, which means you must deeply enjoy character-only movies to get into this film.  other comparisons to there will be blood are generally accurate, but i did find Blood to be a much more compelling story with far better acting.  just not that exciting, and i have a hard time finding either joaquin phoenix and philip seymour hoffman compelling actors.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I expected director Peter Jackson to make a long and boring story out of this novel.  I was pleasantly surprised.  All the characters were introduced with precision and detail  I loved the elf army and the scenes with the Orcs.  If you enjoyed the three previous Lord of the Rings films, you'll be enthralled with this story. Bilbo Baggins is the lead in this trilogy.  These films will be remembered decades from now.  They have as much staying power as the novel! Peter Jackson is an expert at world building and I wish he would lend his talents to other film properties.  Only one could speculate what he'd do with Superman, The Shadow and Doc Savage.  I would like to see another trilogy follow the Hobbit.  I could watch these films forever.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The story was riveting!  I literally couldn't stop reading until it was done. The author gave plenty of detail without wasting time. It definitely holds the possibility of a sequel!
1439127727|4.0|This is a good read.  It gives the reader a good look at what really goes on behind the scene.
B0094LUH4A|5.0|We chose this movie one night when we had nothing better to do.  I had long known about this movie - but only in a peripheral way.  We didn't know what to expect as far as the story.  We really enjoyed the movie - the story was compelling and had a great nuanced ending.  Barbra Streisand was amazing in her role and wow - Robert Redford is the quintessential leading man.  He is so good-looking in this movie, I think my husband is in love with him too!<br />It's themes are still relevant and resonant now - I highly recommend this movie if you have never seen it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the best. game I've. ever played also feels like I have a real horse. and the games are awesome. &quot;&quot;
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You want this app!!! It is great and is a wonderful twist on subway surfers!!! I love everything about it!!!
B002QYNIHU|5.0|This is without a doubt, one of the best Goku figures out there! I bought this for my 11 year old boy to go with the Gohan in this same series, and he loves it! I recommend this for older people more because it says on the box \\"Ages 15 and up\\" so before I gave this and the Gohan to him I specifically said be super careful. It has held up well! Not even a scratch! Goku comes with 2 faces (powering up face and serious face), 2 fists, 2 Kamehameha hands, 2 \\"Ki Blast\\" hands and a \\"Instant Transmission\\" hand. He is also really articulate! He looks just like he does in the anime. The only problems are the high prices, and my son said he wanted a \\"happy face to go with Gohan's happy face\\". I totally recommend this to any collector!
B00C5XBAOA|4.0|I was really hesitant to buy this set after reading the negative reviews. We've had these for 2 weeks now and I would agree that the heads do fall off on occasion. My daughter carries these around the better part of each day, and I'd say a head pops off one of the five, about every other day. Not too bad. When you first open the package, heads will likely come off as you are removing them from the molded plastic that holds them in place. Obviously, you will not find yourself in this situation again. If you find the occasional head-loss annoying, I'd suggest gluing the heads on unless your child is intent on being able to move their heads from side to side.<br /><br />I also agree that it's difficult to stand some of the characters up. Sofia and Amber can be made to stand by bending them ever so slightly at the waist. Miranda has no trouble standing whatsoever. I can neither make Roland nor James stand at all; they are just too top-heavy.<br /><br />We just got the castle for my daughter tonight, so I can't comment on how well they work with the castle. But I'm hoping the castle will shed light on why some characters would be made without the ability to stand. It just seems a bit strange.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say I'm very happy with this purchase given that it suits my daughters two needs: carrying them around, and laying them down in a row to look at, as she watches the Sofia movie/shows. If my daughter were older and used them more for pretend-play, I think I'd be disappointed by their inability to stand. And although many of them bend at the waist so that they sit, some are harder than others to bend because of their big dresses; that too, would annoy me if tis feature were important to my daughter.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I'm very glad I saw the movie BEFORE I read the book. The characters are close to what they were in the movie but of course with more detail and motives. Pat and Tiffany both seem more damaged than they do in the movie, both for good reasons. Pat's father is not nearly as nice as he is in the movie and his form of mental illness is much more frightening than the OCD he displays in the movie. Frankly the book is a bit violent but I still loved it and have already read it twice since I purchased it. It's very compelling and hard to put down.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This a great cast doing what they do best.  Deep, insightful and touching throughout.  A great addition to my library.  Being a retired opera singer myself, it is particularly relevant. These are people that I know and care for.
B0030BCCB6|5.0|Hear this band before they went way out commercial ,Before the love songs and the sell out,<br />Peter Green wrote &#34;BLACK MAGIC WOMAN&#34;. A huge hit for Santana.Jeremy Spencer was a walking history of R&R and Blues.<br />Mick And Mac what a great rhythm section ! Fresh out of John Mayalls Blues Breakers. This is what it was like for the English Rockers who love American Blues.
B00CO52NLI|2.0|I downloaded this game for my daughter, and while it's different than many other &#34;similar&#34; games, it's a lot of work. If you only have one or two species, its not bad, but when you have four or more different types of animals, it takes forever to care for them.<br />Since you can only hold so much in your inventory, every time you care for one species, you have to (1)get items from storage room. (2) use items to care for that species (3) take out the trash (4) return items to storage. Not to mention, you have to get water from the well and check the health of each pet.<br /><br />So when you have three hamsters, three gerbils and three rabbits, you have to go through this whole process each time. So far, my daughter doesn't have any horses or snakes yet.<br />So if you're looking for a game that takes much of your time, this is it. But if you want a game where you dont have to constantly play in order to keep your pets alive...find a different one. This game is like a full time job at an animal shelter.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|My friend recommended this book as I am going through a difficult and painful relationship. While reading The Four Agreements, my eyes were opened to things about myself that I'd never been aware of. Reasons for why I have allowed certain things to happen, and more importantly how to stop the cycle. I read the book in one day and am now excited to apply these agreements to my new vision of life.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|is awesome I love da fluffy. Unicorn  I also love the fireman costume .Ps bedo bedo bedo bbbbbbbbaaaaaaaannnnnnnaaaaaaaannnnnaaaaaaasssssss the minions love.z
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I like following a series.  This one holds your interest because of all that is going on.<br /><br />All walks of life are displayed as it was in those times, not to mention some fine actors.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|This is an excellent movie!  Watched it when I had surgery and it was an inspiration.  Great job!!! A winner.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This film has the perfect balance of action, comedy, and heart. Bruce Willis is amazing, as usual. Looking forward to seeing the sequel tomorrow!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Five stars I read this book about four to five years ago and read it repeatedly over the course of those years till now I also read the other books in the series. This book is so good I can't describe how awesome it is I am now 15 and its still good though that may be saying something about my reading style I still love it.
B00838HRP2|1.0|I didn't know this DVD wouldn't work in USA, so I'll be returning this item as soon as possible.<br />-Chrystina
B00DW39B2K|5.0|Didn't expect much going into this movie considering all the bad word of mouth coming from cynical critics, but I was surprised by quite a few strong aspects to this movie. First, this is an amazing script. I would love to sit and read this script by a fire. The dialogue is outstanding, the meditations on war feel more real than most films and Killing Season never dumbs itself down to just another action movie.<br />There were quite a few set ups in the movie where I winced and quite a few exchanges between DeNiro and Travolta that brought me into the movie completely. Don't believe all the jokes about the bad accents. There's a reason the accents are the way that they are if you actually pay attention to the movie.<br />Killing Season is a fantastic film with a strong script, strong dialogue, a lot to say and beautiful scenery. Kudos to everyone involved especially the director, Mark Steven Johnson, and the writer, Evan Daugherty. Great film. Highly recommended.<br />If you liked this review or stories to do with the military then please check out my book, Basically, here on Amazon. It is a collection of stories from my time during basic training.
B004GYY714|5.0|I don't write many app reviews ... because most range from useless to \\"eh\\". TuneIn Radio, however, is incredibly useful and amazingly fun! I can listen to local radio stations, public access radio (scanners, health services), and a huge number of world-wide stations of all sorts; both over the air and internet, including my favorite melodic pop station, Alan Haber's Pure Pop Radio!! My Kindle is now my radio, as well as my book and my gameboy! Happy am I!!!!
0785153942|4.0|The comic was most enjoyable and re-readable. Overall this is a neat book. There were a few flaws however. The primary issue was that the story was too short if it was a little longer and more detailed it would have been perfect. If you like pacific rim or are going to see the movie you'll enjoy this book
B0068WEC0I|4.0|Good that they fit as many songs on here as they did... great for those of us who have actually seen the Cirque du Soleil show live so you can relive some moments.  Not so great that some of the songs are mere snippets... just when you're getting into one it changes to another one.  That's the nature of the beast though<br /><br />Some great mixes and mash-ups on here and some interesting takes on some of your favorites.  Great buy but don't expect a full on greatest hits catalog...
B000OXHRRC|5.0|Just love a feel good movie. This is a movie I love to watch over and over again. One of my favorites
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy this game on my down time. I really like how details the graphics are. You should download this app today.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book blew me away, I was simply expecting a teenage love story. This is such a deep read. It's funny and happy and turns very serious suddenly. Well written, would recommend to anyone. I may need a chapter break before I read the sequel. Wow.
0307474259|4.0|I found this book to be very insightful.  Time will tell if the content is accurate, but I definitely see results with the &#34;no carb&#34; lifestyle.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|i love this game it is awesome i would recomend this game for any one and it is free cool.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read this series in about a week by cramming it in every spare moment I had because I simply couldn't put it down. Real characters, a strong female lead, and plot twists that are unbelievable made this an incredible series. Highly recommended
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|loging in is so confusing like it takes for ever and getting into a game is hard other than that it an awsome game
B000QK7YQ2|3.0|If you were blown away 40+ years ago when it came out, it is a nice walk down memory lane. It looks like it was shot on film that hasn't aged too well, and if someone has digitized it, some color correction would have been appreciated.
1616551607|5.0|For the series' 25th anniversary, Square-Enix released a flurry of Final Fantasy merchandise ranging from arrangement albums to perfumes. One of the centerpieces of the celebration was a reprint of Yoshitaka Amano's artbook set, \\"The Sky\\". This lavish boxset was quickly sold out in Japan back in 2001, and fans worldwide would have to resort to paying steep import prices to get their hands on it. Ironically, the first worldwide release of this set was limited to 1000 copies, leaving many without a copy. Amano signed each set, so even this second printing is quite expensive. Third time's a charm, however, and the 2013 edition has finally reached patiently waiting fans.<br /><br />The wait was well worth it. \\"Slipcased edition\\" is a misnomer; the box is actually covered with a nice cloth fabric and has embossed lettering. There's no easily damaged cardboard junk here. A small ribbon is attached to a magnetic opening, revealing the goodies inside. They have that \\"chemical smell\\" common to new Chinese printed books, but it's easy enough to let them air out a bit.<br /><br />As for the books themselves, I couldn't be happier to say they are nothing short of wonderful. The first book (FFI-FFIII) feels like a humble beginning, displaying Amano's skill at creating monsters and iconic heroes. He takes it up a notch with book two (FFIV-FFVI), with page after page featuring delightful watercolor paintings and character art. I assume Square was paying him well in the early 90s, because this is the thickest book of the lot. Book three (FFVII-X) features much less artwork, mostly because he was relegated to the status of promotional illustrator and no longer main designer, in addition to being busy with his solo exhibition in New York at the time. However, the third book is definitely intriguing. Amano experiments with printmaking on FFVII, and refines his work in the medium on FFVIII. Much like the game, Amano backtracks to traditional roots on FFIX. Surprisingly, he takes a 180-degree turn again on FFX, where most of the artwork is in a dark and sketchy style. In short, it seems every piece used for promoting the games is here, except for a few that I noticed were absent (i.e: Amano's pieces for EGM Magazine, and the FFX prototype logo).<br /><br />On the technical side, the paper is good quality, however some of the pieces (maybe 10 or so) exhibit grittiness or blur. It could be the source files, or the art itself, but it doesn't happen enough to be a real concern. I do regret missing out on the small flipbook and \\"All About Amano\\" interview book that were not included in this reprint, although I would not pay the appalling prices people are charging for the limited printing. Despite this, The Sky is the easiest and most affordable way to add to your collection of Amano or Final Fantasy.<br /><br />For a more pleasant viewing experience, I recommend pouring your beverage of choice, the soundtrack of your favorite game on the speakers, and letting \\"The Sky\\" do the rest of the work. Welcome to the fantasy.

B0014D6PCO|5.0|Christian Bale brings true life and emotion to the Batman character. Completely action packed and a true winner! Batman Begins is an exciting start to the modern Batman trilogy.
0307716554|4.0|This was a very good book!  The only problems I had were the way the mother would meander into memories for pages.  The story itself and how the mystery of the fire played out was very good.  The viewpoints from outside their bodies viewing what was going on as they struggled for life was very well done.  Sometimes I did lose track of who was just thinking and who was actually in the \\"real\\" world talking, but if you stay focused it's an intriguing concept and I hope that's how it does happen!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee child has a way of captivating your attention all the way to the end. Great read for the second in ther series!
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|A good documentary piece, it took away the Australian side of Rodriguez abroad fame but tells the story from the South Africa perspective, it is inspiring and refreshing.

B002LYTNR4|5.0|I love Eckhart Tolle & his easy to understand approach to how to focus on the present moment, has helped me deal with the sudden & unexpected death of my dear husband.  I continue to recommend his work to all my family & friends.  I no longer postpone my happiness to a distant future; I seize the moment - don't worry about the future or the past & make each instant count. We are all connected & each one of us has an infinite source of compassion & joy of living.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The old photos are delightfully creepy, and the settings and characters are convincing and engaging enough. The story starts to unravel a bit toward the end as its half-cooked time travel premise stops making sense (and thus slows down the momentum). An enjoyable read, though, with a nice lightness of style. A good book to read with an older--maybe 10+--child.
B00B4FU6KE|2.0|Karen Joy Fowler clearly cares a lot about animals' rights and, just as clearly, did a ton of research on the subject prior to writing this book.<br /><br />The problem is that she then tried to develop a novel around that research but, seemingly, wasn't willing leave even one iota of all that research out.  So, we end up with a narrator who periodically slips out of the story to deliver long, long lectures to us.  Wait, I mean - LONG, LONG, LONG lectures.<br /><br />This book is just a very long slog.  The point of research is to advance and support the plot; here, though, the plot is just a flimsy construct to frame all that research.  So, we get a narrator whose most pronounced characteristic is that she's hell-bent on data-dumping on us, weakly-drawn supporting characters, and arbitrary plot twist aiming at setting us up for - yep - anther lecture.<br /><br />Skip it.  The only reason I even gave it 2 stars is because I support animal rights, too.

B00797MB0O|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />By definition, I think a great movie is one which makes you feel and makes you think long after the credits roll. This movie worried me, bothered me, made me go seek out reviews and ultimately made me rewatch certain scenes to clarify what got me so upset. Just about every reviewer, whether the professionals or amateurs, says Mavis is HORRIBLE and her behavior is indefensible and I can see why on the surface that might seem true. But just a damn minute, here. Buddy's wife starts out the movie by doing something just stunningly horrible. She e-mails a baby announcement to Mavis. Think about it. Why would she do that... 17 years after Mavis is no longer with Buddy. I actually stopped the movie to make sure that the e-mail said FROM BETH SLADE and TO MAVIS, and you have to ask yourself how did she even get ahold of Mavis' e-mail address after that many years. Once you realize (especially in light of later events) how horrible that was, you begin to review your feelings about Mavis and about how she behaves. BIG, BIG spoiler: Late in the film she tells a whole crowd of people that she had been pregnant when she was 20 with Buddy's baby, but had suffered a miscarriage, which evidently left her unable to conceive. I feel like Beth had to know that, which makes her behavior in sending that announcement especially cruel. So this rips Mavis' misery wide open and she unwisely decides to GO GET BUDDY, convincing herself that they had been perfect for each other and all they need to do is get back together. She searches out an old mix tape given to her by Buddy, captioned \\"Mad Love, Buddy,\\" meaning those songs were meant to be meaningful to them both, and she plays, and rewinds and replays one song which must have been the MOST MEANINGFUL one. Did you see the look of shock and pain in her face when that's the first song played by Beth's band, as if crowing that she got Buddy and now that song belonged to her. How f-ing cruel was that? Yeah, yeah, Mavis is a mess, a drunk, delusional, career going downhill, heading towards middle age with little to show for it... but if you just think about what happened to her is it really so hard to feel empathy for her pain, for her despair, for her need to get back what she lost? Of course, she can't. And I swear to God I can't believe how clueless Buddy is. He's almost literally a cardboard cutout and in all reality had Mavis been able to get him back, he would have bored her pants off in no time. The only thing I have a hard time forgiving this movie for is the way it created this wonderful person in Matt and then, in the end, just leaves him behind. There will never be a sequel, but in my head I keep seeing her realize, once she's back in the Mini Apple, that the real human being she should have in her life is the man who's just as damaged and just as smart as she can be.
140006922X|1.0|Aslam is a dishonest man.  The people behind the publication of this book are organizations from the radical left.  This author claims to have a PHd in religion when he has a BS.  He has degrees in religious protest through art and media, fiction writing and sociology.  He is anti-Israel.  This is book is an attempt to re-write history, making Jesus look like a revolutionary like Che.  This is false.  Aslam says that the gospels were written by faith when in FACT they were eye witness account of writings.  The left is constantly trying to destroy Christianity, America, marriage, and the family.  This book is another attempt to change history.  Aslam is a fraud and a liar.  This book is garbage.

B00C7O8TSM|5.0|This is a great album from a great band we thought we might never hear again. Most of the important hits are here, plus some interesting unusual selections. The song I miss most here is &#34;Darlin' &#34;. I hope they performed it at the concerts.
B000ION23A|5.0|This is such a good movie. DVD is of high quality.  Makes a great gift for the Movie Nut in your life.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This was a great story, kept my interest to the point where I could not put it down so read it all day long! You really want the very best for Megan after all she has been through. I like the idea that some of the other characters will be in the series and I look forward to reading those.  I see some reviews complaining about editing issues.  Sorry but I paid attention to the story and if there were minor issues they did not affect my interest at all.  I look forward to reading some of the other books by this author.
0989524116|5.0|A life altering journey for the characters and maybe even for the reader. I got so much out of it, I'm just starting to read it again. I recommend everyone read it at least once.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Scar Tissue, yeah it's not focused on the RHCP's, more so on Kiedis' personally life which is a real roller coaster of a ride, that could have happen to any kid growing up in the punk era.<br />  I found myself imagining what it would have been like living in California during such times and how exciting it would have been with all the fresh, new things that CA was experimenting with and making impressions which spread the whole world now.<br />  Anthony Kiedis is a great singer songwriter and this books gives great insight into his upbringing and surroundings.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this game on a whim when I was in college. Me and a good friend were looking for a boardgame to play with people in the dorm. This was recommended by the man who owned the small game store in Potsdam, NY.<br /><br />We played this game every single day for the rest of the school year, sometimes several times a day. We bought the add ons for seafarers, and for 5-6 players for both sea farers and the standard game.<br /><br />Absolutely the best times I've had around a gaming table were around Catan's colorful hexagons. Having played this, games like Monopoly and Risk completely pale in comparison. In those games, people are eliminated from play... so... what's the fun for them? I get a couple of friends around the table... what are the eliminated players supposed to do? Walk away? How is that good for an evening?<br /><br />In Catan, everyone stays in the game until the end. And changes of fortune from a few (un)lucky roles can change the board dramatically, so a come from behind victory can easily happen. The game is different every time, because the board is different, and the dice are different. There's diplomacy, long-term strategy, and the occasionally extremely fun/frustrating moment.<br /><br />I absolutely love Settlers of Catan, and would recommend it to any and everyone.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love these characters.  I'm so glad Sylvia is writing another book for us to buy with Eva & Gideon as characters.  I could keep buying 2 or 3 more with these characters.  I don't know why readers are so upset that another book is coming out.

B007FRYQFQ|5.0|An inside look into the band's origins.  Lots of fun watching old footage of the guys & listening to their memories of those far off days.  I thoroughly enjoyed this.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Starts out OK, and there are some good chapters along the book, but overall I found it difficult to read since there's no story line. It's a collection of interviews of people who were involved in the zombie war in different ways in different countries around the world. Lots of clichés too, which I particularly dislike. Wouldn't recommend it, though somebody did recommend it to me, so as in everything it ddepends on your taste
B0052RDHTM|1.0|I loved reading this book and have already read Book 2.  I am eagerly awaiting Book 2 of this series.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|Just purchased the game an hour ago, and I am finding it very enjoyable. Lots of fun clues to unlock and you have to travel back and forth between areas to utilize what you have found.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game os so much fun you can get bee minons and bannanas and conis and other stuff SO FUN.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|A book about human nature and relationships and life. Sometimes a bit harsh, but far from the brutality of The Kite Runner. Would definitely recommend it and probably read it again.

B0090SI56Y|3.0|\\"The Wolverine\\" may not be a direct sequel to \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine,\\" but it will force people to remember a disastrous superhero film from 2009 that they had recessed deep within their memory core. \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" is a mess of a film known for rushing Marvel character favorites Gambit and Deadpool and bringing in a worldwide gross of over $373 million on a $150 million budget despite leaking onto the internet months in advance with incomplete special effects. \\"The Wolverine\\" hasn't gone without its issues either as Darren Aronofsky was originally attached as director, but was eventually replaced by James Mangold. Take solace in the fact that \\"The Wolverine\\" is the closest we'll ever get to an excellent Wolverine film.<br /><br />Logan has essentially lost any reason to live in \\"The Wolverine.\\" When he killed Jean, he realized that everyone around him dies while he continues to live with a curse that no man should ever have to carry on his shoulders. Jean, while only appearing in Logan's dreams, seems to almost act as Logan's conscience as she questions the decisions he's making and keeps asking when he'll join her in the afterlife. She serves as a source of encouragement for a way out for Logan, but in reality it's just a piece of the past that Logan can't let go of.<br /><br />There is a ton of story in \\"The Wolverine,\\" so much that aside from the brief bar sequence at the opening of the film that the action doesn't really pick up for a good 30-40 minutes, but its speedball antics almost seem everlasting at times. The funeral battle that leads to a chase through an arcade as the archer Harada (Will Yun Lee) runs effortlessly on rooftop ledges lasts an incredibly long time. You're barely able to catch your breath when the exhausting speed train sequence kicks in. Jumping ahead, the arrow sequence near the end of the film is packed with exceptional imagery; Japanese rooftops lurking in the background at night, snow lightly falling on the ground, and the way dozens of ninjas attack Logan in this specific scene is just fantastically memorable.<br /><br />The humor is very hit or miss whether it's Logan's scattered use of profanity or Logan feeling violated after his only bath and haircut in the film. Logan and Mariko (Tao Okamoto) stumbling onto a love hotel pushes the film's humor into awkward territory. While Noburo's (Brian Tee) pool scene could be considered the film's funniest scene, the scene where a wounded Logan is tended to by a veterinary student is where the film's flaws interrupt a near pleasant experience up to that point.<br /><br />In the original comics and even in the \\"X-Men\\" cartoon from the early 90s, Wolverine not only had a history in Japan but also knew Japanese. Obviously some things had to be changed for the live-action films, but Logan not knowing any Japanese at all in \\"The Wolverine\\" seemed a little ignorant on his part. While the story is surprisingly well developed, is structurally solid, and story points are consistently introduced early on and returned to later, certain characters are really just downright boring. Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) is a key ingredient to Silver Samurai's uprising, but if it wasn't for her snake-like abilities using up the film's special effects budget the character would be nothing more than a Poison Ivy knockoff. While Harada is a really fun character to watch, the way his character is written is awful. He's loyal to one side and then the other because so-and-so is working with them, but then has a change of heart because a childhood friend stabs him in the thigh.<br /><br />Thankfully, the sequence featuring ninjas on motorcycles from the first trailers for the film was removed for the theatrical cut of the film. The trailers also made it seem like Logan would just be cut repeatedly in the facial region throughout the entire film before healing and causing a bunch of drama for some reason. That isn't the case either. The finale of the film is downrightfierce, especially the climax of the Silver Samurai/Wolverine battle. It's a shame you don't get to see more of Hiroyuki Sanada as Shingen though. He's mostly very arrogant in his scenes, but he has two extremely intense fight scenes that are incredibly entertaining.<br /><br />The film is loaded with Japanese culture and history, which is one of the reasons the story is as strong as it is. The film isn't exactly a Disney film either as Wolverine bleeds a lot, blood is constantly shown on his claws, and blades are seen piercing through people's torsos, while James Mangold has promised a more violent version on Blu-ray. However, what they do to the Silver Samurai character is tragic. It may make sense for the story, but turning the character into a giant adamantium machine waters down the original character a bit. It reminds you too much of \\"Iron Man\\" and once you make that connection \\"The Wolverine\\" seems to have way more in common with \\"Iron Man\\" than it should.<br /><br />\\"The Wolverine\\" is a vast improvement over \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine.\\" It's more story driven than its predecessor, utilizes all of the new characters introduced to their full potential, and sets up next year's \\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\\" in a really satisfying way (for the love of Galactus stay through the end credits). \\"The Wolverine\\" tries so hard to be the best live-action film incarnation of Wolverine out there and it mostly succeeds, but its little issues are just enough to keep the film from being exceptional.fierce, especially the climax of the Silver Samurai/Wolverine battle.

B00D6BU8GG|3.0|I've seen all of the Die Hard series. This one was ok but I can barely remember what happened, Glad we rented it and didn't buy it
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|It is quite different from the Disney movie. Terrific twists for all of the older children you know in their mid teens.
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|Once again Sparks devises an ending that leaves you feeling cheated and disheartened. But it did take imagination to come up with such a bleak ending. Hope his future books are more positive.
3836538725|2.0|Been a fan of Salgado's work for many years.  This book needed serious editing.  The presentation of many of the larger photographs is marred by a fold in the middle, other photographs are simply too small.  Half the number of pages with a more thoughful format would have produced a far superior collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't wait to get my hands on the next book and next till trilogy is done! There wasn't one slow moment in the whole book for me. I laughed, I cried and now I'm hollow from the ending. Wait till the next book!
B001992NUQ|4.0|This is an enjoyable movie, and the many reviews here shed plenty of light on its details, I'm sure. It has a very original story line, and is well acted. The only idea presented in this movie and that kids seem to take literally...and the part that is REALLY BS...is the line in the movie where the narrator (Norton's character) says that fighting turns your a$$ into stone, or something like that. Folks, fighting is not exercise. It is not healthy. It does not build muscle like lifting weights or burn fat like aerobics. It INJURES, period. It's the ultimate machismo release, yes, but it will damage your body, not harden it up. This was entertaining as a movie, but the idea of kids actually forming their own fight clubs in real life is totally STUPID. It's not cool, guys, it's just stupid. If you want to fight, go join the army...or join an organized boxing club, get a trainer, get the right equipment, and do it legit!

B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Multiple tales all told at once, left us confused for a moment, but quickly made up for it with the absolutely great story.
B00CDUVDEC|4.0|This isn't DOWN. This isn't Pantera. This isn't Superjoint Ritual. This is a solo record that has much more in common with hardcore than it does thrash or groove metal. Phil doesn't \\"sing\\" here. He screams. Neither Dimebag (RIP) nor Pepper wrote these songs. Phil did. Don't expect virtuoso compositions. Phil is 45 years old, not 25, so no, his voice isn't what it once was. It has aged well, however, and this is a very good but not great record. Hard, heavy, brutal, and refreshing. Nothing new or groundbreaking, but Phil doing what he does so well. Hardcore, with some thrash, industrial, and noise thrown in for good measure. 8/10.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What a cute game?! I love how fast the Minion moves and my nephew who is 2 loves watching while I play. The sound effects are great and the color scheme is bright and fun as well.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|What can one say about Jamie Foxx, fantastic job of carrying off the character he played. I enjoyed the movie mainly because of the way the story was told and the acting of Jamie Foxx.
0345529057|4.0|...but the books are the small trade book size so sometimes (and this is really silly that I have to say this), but sometimes it is hard to keep the book open at night when I am reading in bed...  These books are like 700 pages long!  And it's a lot to hold open!!  So the book is good reading, but these books aren't the easiest to use at night time when I am getting tired.  You definitely need to read these books though!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|No wonder the Jack Reacher series is so successful, it gets off to a great start in this well written book.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This has been a wonderful experience reading the word provided online I will recommend this website to my church family

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Takes up considerable space for as simple as it is, but that's what uninstall is for! Makes for a much more pleasant waiting room stay at the doctors office!!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I had my doubts about this movie, I think mainly because Matt Damon was not playing the role.  However once the movie started and the story became stronger, I knew Jeremy Renner was the right pick for the lead character. Can hardly wait until Jeremy Renner and Matt Damon star together in a Bourne movie. This movie I am sending to my best friend. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good movie.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I never write reviews but had to on this one! I was so pleasantly surprised when I received this watch. I was a little skeptical because I had never heard of this brand and how really inexpensive it is. It came in great packaging, the size is perfect (big but not ridiculous), the watch has good weight to it and looks Awesome.<br />It seems too good to be true... If this watch holds up I will be buying many more watches from INVICTA!!<br />Thanks :-)
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|If you saw the first season and liked it you will enjoy season two even more.  Enjoy this marvelous treat.

B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|Good show if you are looking for hours of Sci-fi TV.  There are like 20+ episodes in this season. I've never been an avid watcher of space shows, but I like this one so far.  Characters are good and the premise is interesting. It feels a little dated, but I realize this show started 15 years ago, so that is to be expected. I would recommend it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I was searching for something to play that was like sim city. This is almost just as good. You will not be disappointed. It is very addictive though so be forewarned!

B0064MGU98|5.0|The characters are just so real. It doesn't feel so much like a television show drama as a retelling of real events with the complexity that real life contains. The bad guys aren't all bad and the good guys aren't all good.  Definitely worth watching.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|I like this one!  I initially got it for my son but found myself playing at times also.  Cool game!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions and this game is so addicting I can pay for hours and hours, a must get.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|It was a very enjoyable movie. Didn't really have many expectations, but a movie with such a great cast should be pretty good. I love Malkovich one of my all time favs!
B005DOKM9M|5.0|this is great, really cute design and keeps my kindle nice and safe. It also kind of hides it so people don't know its a kindle at first and are less likely to steal it. once again, really cute design and really safe.

Thank you George, you've made me laugh, made me cry, but more importantly, you've taken me away from a world I've always wanted to abandon and created a new world for me to escape to.<br /><br />People live, and people die. George knows this, things happen. It is preferable to me that he's not afraid to kill off anyone, and I mean ANYone, main character or not. It keeps you guessing, it plays with your mind.<br /><br />The inclusion and glorification of politics makes this series come to life and shine. Magic is a lesser element here, as political backstabbing and scheming runs rampant, seemingly turning a well written fantasy into a fantasy-mystery and even fantasy-horror at times.<br /><br />Thank you George. I look forward to the upcoming Winter.

0985557834|5.0|I just received my pre-ordered copy of PFT2.  This is another great product from JD of \\"Tying It All Together.\\"  My favorite bit is the chapter on tying bags and containers.  Coming in at a very close number two is the chapter on Zipper ties.<br /><br />Just like its predecessor, PFT2 gives clear instructions with great full color pictures.  There is a wide variety of paracord ties shown from beginning to the more challenging, such as the chapter on making a pair of sandals from paracord. PFT2 repeats the basic knowledge needed for a beginner so there isn't a need to purchase PFT1.  That side...if you dont have PFT1, I believe it to be well worth the money as it contains some great ties its own self.<br /><br />I own and have looked through dozens of books and manuals about paracord tying and they sit mostly unused since Paracord Fusion Ties 1, and now 2, give me everything I need.  But wait--there's more....<br /><br />Along with JD's two books there is a whole slew of great videos with litterally hundreds of different ties you can do with paracord at [...]<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about paracord ties, as well as those all ready active in the hobby.  I can hardly wait for volume three to arrive.<br /><br />Craig B

B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a moving and compelling coming of age story told through a series of letters sent by  a high school freshman, &#34;Charlie.&#34;  Although &#34;Charlie&#34; faces some really hard times and some intense truths about himself, his classmates, his friends, and his family, when confronted with these truths &#34;Charlie&#34; has an amazing and innocent approach that allows him to see people's value and to understand the tragedy and heroism in some of the most unlikely events.  In short, I love this book and enjoyed the movie and I would recommend them to anyone (especially those who love Catcher in the Rye).

B00338QENI|3.0|Assigned reading for school, not unbearable, but it spends a lot of time on Henrietta's extended family. It also jumps around her timeline, breaking up already small plot lines following the thousands of unimportant secondary characters. Depressingly, It fails to tie her family's stories to her cell line. It is saved by the interesting moral issues it raises relating to race and medicine.

B00CJGP116|2.0|This album was long overdue and I think Marc Anthony has lost his touch quite a bit. I have been a fan since his first salsa album \\"Otra Nota\\" and this new album does not hold up to his previous releases. Some of these songs sound forced and rushed. He just doesn't flow like he used to. In some of the songs, you can hear him gasping for air and the music doesn't have that captivating feeling it once had. In previous albums, he sounded in control and confident in his voice. The best song on the album for me is #9: Cautivo De Este Amor. It's the only one that reminds me of the old Marc Anthony. I am not a fan of the Vivir Mi Vida track. It sounds like something you would hear out of Ricky Martin, not a legendary Salsa icon like Marc Anthony. When I first heard it on the radio, I said to myself, after 9 years of not releasing a Salsa album, this is it?! I was disappointed to say the least. The musical arrangements in previous albums were a lot more collective especially in the percussion sections. I think taking such a long break from making Salsa albums has come back to haunt him in this release.

B0081BU42O|4.0|I liked the one about the elephant hell better, but this was still a fun read.. I feel that his last few plots were more inspired and interesting, and i enjoyed them.

Terrible directing - generic, extremely predictable, poor acting, and abysmal story.

I'm sorry but I want my Men to be Men. The girl is just whiny & treats everyone around her just awful. It gets old after awhile. More then once I wanted to slap her for treating her supposed love of her life like he was no better then the ground she walked on. Then I wanted to shake him & say why are you allowing her to treat you so bad.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|First, if you have a recent(?) Vizio TV, make sure that your \\"CEC Function\\" in TV settings is turned on.  This function allows Chromecast to control your TV.  And then select discover, and it should find your Chromecast and name a custom input.  (My TV creates a new Chromecast input)<br /><br />My TV, model XVT553SV, does not supply power via HDMI, but it does supply USB power, but only when the TV is already turned on.  If you want to give Chromecast the ability to not only select the right input, but also to turn on the TV for you, use the AC power adapter.<br /><br />-------------<br />Rest of the review:<br /><br />I don't know what kind of dark magic it's using, but the thing was able to talk to my phone before logging onto my wifi network.<br /><br />Only caveat for the dead simple setup is for people with multiple AP's or dual band routers.  Make sure what you configure your chromecast while connected to the WiFi network you want it to use.  It's not going to throw you off too far if you don't do that, but it'll ask for the password for the wrong network if you do.<br /><br />So far, it works brilliantly for youtube.<br /><br />The chrome tab mirroring success is completely dependent on how intense the incoming data is.  I was able to successfully watch an HD Vimeo movie, but Hulu was not good at all.  But, the fact you can even do this at all with a simple extension is impressive.<br /><br />I look forward to Chromecast 2 with 5ghz and 802.11ac.
B007BGQFTQ|2.0|I really wanted to like this series for its fantasy and setting. Unfortunately, it turned out not to be for me. I found it too over the top for my tastes and I couldn't get invested in the characters. I found myself skimming the pages rather than delving deeper into the world Carriger has created.<br /><br />I wish I had only purchased the first book in the series instead of the set. However, this had come highly recommended from a friend. Lesson learned.
B004H8GLXQ|3.0|Having just finished Penelope Lively's _How It All Began_, I started The Thirteenth Tale with enthusiasm but was soon disappointed. What I most missed was what the New York Times Book Review praised about Penelope Lively's book when they wrote that it was &#34;An elegant ...work of fiction...emotionally and intellectually  penetrating&#34;. Quite simply, I have found that Gothic novels are not my cup of tea.

B009LNI0T0|5.0|If you are a Haydn enthusiat, then by all means consider purchasing  this superb collection of 79 Haydn symphonies performed by one of the premier period-instrument ensembles at the height of their collective powers under Chris Hogwood.  It is a shame that Universal/L'Oiseau-Lyre apparently abandoned this project to record all 108 Haydn Symphonies before it reached completion. To date there has been no integral recording of them on period instruments.  However, if the listener is willing to supplement Hogwood's incomplete cycle with other recordings of nos. 76-93, 95, 97-99 and 101-103, a complete collection of Haydn symphonies can be assembled.<br /><br />Hogwood's approach to Haydn is brisk but not breathless, bracing but not fierce, elegant but not mincing, scholarly but not pedantic.  The AAM plays splendidly throughout (the natural horns, for which Haydn often wrote excruciatingly difficult parts in his early-to-middle period deserve special commendation).  Hogwood and his band are always aware of the shifts in idiom and style that occur not only from one period of Haydn's career to the next, but often within a single work!  Was there a style that this astonishingly resourceful composer had not mastered--Baroque, Galant, &#34;Sturm und Drang,&#34; High Classical and even proto-Romantic? Though not always a &#34;period performance&#34; enthusiast, I find the AAM's spare ensemble sonority (presumably what Haydn would have had at his disposal in Esterhaza) and resultant chamber-music textures delightful, particularly in slow movements. I also applaud Hogwood's decision not to employ a harpsichord (or other) continuo; it is not needed, and its incessant clatter would prove quite distracting over the long haul of this very expansive symphonic canon.  Textures emerge clearly, and often with fetching delicacy, without any reinforcement from a keyboard instrument.  Hogwood favors taking all repeats, even those in the recap of the Minuets; some listeners may find this too much of a good thing, but this was the scholarly protocol Hogwood adhered to.<br /><br />Despite occasional interpretive misfires, this is as consistently satisfying a HIP traversal of the bulk of Haydn's symphonic output as you will find.  Strongly recommended -- though I would search elsewhere for an affordable copy.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  Only a few days after I wrote the above review, I noted that the price for this set had come down significantly--though it is still quite high for what is, ostensibly, a &#34;bargain box.&#34;  If you have the means, however, this edition should prove either an invigorating introduction to these works or an invaluable supplement to whatever other Haydn recordings you have in your collection.  Dorati's complete cycle, on modern instruments, is still the most generally recommendable way of acquiring &#34;Haydn in bulk,&#34; though compared with Hogwood's airy lightness, Dorati's direction can seem heavy-handed.a good thing, but this was the scholarly protocol Hogwood adhered to.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Holy cow. I had read and heard good things about this book. Many people said they thought it was really funny and some women were even posting on Facebook that their significant others were laughing along to it with them. So I went into this reading experience with really high expectations.<br /><br />This book does not disappoint. At the beginning of the novel, Drew describes how he has the flu and the disheveled, unhygienic man we see is not really him. He backtracks and explains how he went from being a confident womanizer to the sickly man we see today. And at the root of it all is Kate.<br /><br />The first thing that surprised me is that this book is solely from Drew's POV. I hadn't expected that, but it was a nice surprise. Drew has quite a voice. He is witty and snarky and really blunt and vulgar about life and men and all things related. He says whatever he wants to say, and often I found myself laughing out loud at him and the ridiculous things that would come out of his mouth. But even though I knew at the beginning that he was kind of a jerk and a shameless womanizer, I couldn't help but kind of love him at the same time. Watching him go from being the confident douchebag to a romantic sweetheart was really interesting. And, in the end, he is still himself. He still spouts off the vulgar phrases and still fantasizes about all of Kate's body parts.<br /><br />And Kate is a woman to be envied. She is headstrong and good at her job, and she has enough confidence to really make it where she wants to go. She banters with Drew without batting an eye, and the chemistry between them was always made evident in dialogue. She is so much more than a pretty face (although Drew makes it clear that she is one of those, too!), and  I loved reading about her and watching her grow throughout the novel from Drew's eyes.<br /><br />This book was funny. The story was great. Drew is not a perfect specimen, and that's what makes him such a desirable man. This author is one that I will definitely be on the lookout for. I recommend this book for sure!t I will definitely be on the lookout for. I recommend this book for sure!
1426308469|4.0|Dinosaurs are a perennial kid favorite, and this is National Geographic's take for the younger set. Given that they are extinct, this book has to rely on drawings rather than photos. (Interestingly, it makes no use of photos of fossils.) I found the illustrations slightly toward the cartoonish side; I would have expected something more naturalistic from National Geographic. As a note, there are some pictures of carnivores doing what carnivores do, as well as some mild dino-a-dino fighting.<br /><br />The book is organized by dinosaur size, from small to gigantic. (In between are big and giant--these are dinosaurs, after all!) The downside to this organization is that it loses the sense of what dinosaurs lived together. Typical of this series, the text is simple but informative, but the layout is a bit cluttered for my taste.<br /><br />Not the best effort I've seen in this series, but it should still interest and inform the kiddies.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Through this book, Frankl offers readers the insight that suffering cannot be avoided, it can only be conquered. He insists one must learn to cope with struggles positively, find meaning in them, and move forward with a renewed sense of purpose. It is very similar concept of Maslow's self-actualization, and also gives a very clear idea of what is real self-actualization. A very good read for all the age group.

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Don't be deterred by the fact that Geoff Tate is out of the band.  This is an amazing album and the new singer is great.<br /><br />This album is the first time in a long time that I'm happy to say that I am a Queensryche fan! Let's face it folks, they haven't been able to produce a good album in a while.  I would argue the Mindcrime 2 was good, but even I had to skip past the slow ending (it was even more awkward to see Geoff Tate perform the ending to Mindcrime 2 live).  Anyway, you would have to go back to Empire to get a sound like this from them.<br /><br />Although I have the Zune pass and don't really have to purchase albums anymore (although I still do for the bands that I love), this one was worth buying for me.  I'm excited that the band found its way home.<br /><br />I'm already looking forward to the next album from these guys.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|This movie, which I can only describe as a pompous ADHD ride with a side of bad acid trip, really wants to be art. I don't need it to be, but it wants to be-instead of what I wanted, which was thought-provoking entertainment.  The movie keeps feeling as if its coming to a head, about to reveal something, about to transcend what's on the screen, then fails miserably...over and over and OVER, for THREE HOURS.  Hollywood finally comes up with a remotely interesting idea then tries too hard when it shouldn't and not hard enough when it should. It feels more like a bunch of guys on acid made some random stories then put them through a shredder and taped them back together with scotch tape.  There are only feeble, occassional attempts at making the stories parallel.  Art is like Zen, if you think you have it, you don't. It screams \\"look at me, I'm art, I'm art\\"-which only highlights that it is decidedly not art.  Stick to rehashes, Hollywood, you've got no art, no zen, and no soul with rare exception, and this movie is not the exception.

The re-discovery of Rodriguez does a great service to all of us who grew up on the music from the sixties and seventies and were getting very tired of hearing the same songs over and over again.

B00C061I3K|3.0|This CD is pretty good. I like their older stuff more though. My favorite song is NOT Get Lucky, but rather Instant Crush. But I can't rate this higher than 3 stars because there's a &#34;song&#34; near the beginning of the CD called &#34;Giorgio by Moroder&#34; which has Giorgio Moroder talking for a bunch of time. When I listen to the whole disc, it annoys me every time - it's like I'm listening to the radio and some commercial has come on. I have to go over to my player and skip the track every time. If you want to put a track with a bunch of talking in it, PUT IT AT THE END OF THE DISC. Seriously, WTF?  For the record, I actually like Giorgio Moroder a LOT more than Daft Punk. I like his 80s stuff like &#34;Together in Electric Dreams&#34; (with Phil Oakey from the Human League) a lot. I think it's awesome that he was willing to work on a track with Daft Punk, but I still don't want any music album I listen to to have some random commentary track in the middle.

B009ZQTD7Q|2.0|Charlotte Gainsbourg was wonderful as the adult Jane Eyre. William Hurt was not the best actor to play Mr. Rochester, who in the book is a darker character with streaks of humor that never showed in Hurt's rendition.<br /><br />But I still enjoyed this adaptation -- up to the point where it is revealed that Rochester is already married. Rather than run away alone, as occurs in the book, Jane returns to Gateshead where she meets with St. John Rivers and his sisters. Missing was all the drama of Jane wandering alone and saved from death by the Rivers family. I simply stopped watching at this point. I can't imagine what the screenwriter was thinking of, but it completely spoiled the story line for me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is like temple run for kids! I love this game it has lots of little things that temple run doesn't! Even better it doesn't have ads like other free games also it's FREE! I give it five stars and two thumbs up!!!

076115678X|2.0|I've been trying the CG method for a couple of months and not getting great results. Per the prompting of others on a CG forum that I read, I bought this book to see what I had been doing wrong. Which was nothing. The instructions that can be found on the Internet are basically the same as what is found in the book. I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know. I found much of the book content useless, especially the personal stories from women with curly hair. I personally did not go through the same emotional drama trauma caused by curly hair as those ladies. I also found the author's constant punning to be far too twee, especially because she kept pointing it out. Protip: Saying \\"see what I did there?\\" suggests that your pun is not all that clever.<br /><br />Apart from the disappointment in the book, I will be abandoning my CG efforts. I will continue using sulphate and silicone free products, because my hair does seem healthier. But I'm not going to continue with the scrunching, plopping, and air drying. I just don't have time for that. My pre-CG hair routine took less than fifteen minutes after washing and conditioning. With CG it is more like an hour, primarily due to using a diffuser. Although be warned that if other CG'ers or Deva stylists discover you are doing anything but air drying, you will be shunned. It is apparently the most grievous sin a CG can commit. In some ways I feel like I'm freeing myself from a cult of curliness by moving away from their regimen.
B0091REZMW|4.0|At first, it appears that you have to spend money to progress in this game.  If you are patient and don't have hours at a time to waste, you will find this is not true.  Play often for short periods of time to maximize your energy.
B00AKO93JK|2.0|I'm using the full paid version of this app. Why do I need to pay more money to unlock more features?
B0042J6VUS|4.0|This was purchased by my daughter, well for her and she told me I was buying it for her; but the point is she used this a lot the first couple weeks, it worked great, but the biggest problem wasn't the tripod, it was the iPhone's virtual &#34;button&#34; you have to tap-on, its all kinda awkward.  But again, its not the tripod its the iPhone.  However, with patience it can be mastered
0425263991|4.0|Excellent addition to a hot series.<br />Kaleb Krycheck, Psy Counselor, and Sahara Kyriakus, missing member of Night Star Clan (Faith's family). Turns out Kaleb has a big secret. Considered the most Silent of all the Psy; he's not so Silent after all. Sahara has been held captive for 7 years and can't remember much about her life. She and Kaleb obviously have a past and the book slowly unravels their history and their relationship to each other while building on their chemistry and attraction. However since Keleb's past ties directly to Enrique Santano, evil serial killer villain from book one, there are a lot of questions about his character. (and some serous potential ick factor, although everything is resolved in the end.)<br /><br />Krycheck is a very interesting and mysterious character. He's an exciting read although the story took a few chapters to get going. Sahara wasn't very memorable. There was a lot tied up in her secret Psy powers but the powers seemed kind of useless and then the author made using the powers have weird side effects. It seemed not important or valuable enough for the years of captivity and torture she suffered.<br /><br />Also I think Nalini Singh has a plan to confuse and drive readers crazy with all these characters with similar sounding names. Sienna, Sascha, Sahara, hanging out in Sierra Nevadas. Is there a Savannah too or am I making that up? I start to get them all mixed up.<br /><br />A little bit with Faith and Vaughn, a brief sighting of other Dark River characters, a visit with Judd and Father Xavier but mostly this book stands in isolation from the rest of the Psy/Changeling world. These two are on their own but it works.<br /><br />Terrific book. Lots of setup for next characters to explore in the series (the Arrows).<br /><br />MUST READ other books before this or it won't be near as much fun.
0143038095|4.0|I was told to read this book by my sister in law.  I bought this book 2 years ago and just now got around to reading it.  I am ashamed that I kept this book so long on my shelf to collect dust.  This is a wonderful story.<br /><br />At first I was very confused as to keeping who was who in the stories.  I had to keep reverting back to the front pages that listed each mother and daughter's name across from each other.  The book started off by telling the stories of the mothers.  I was trying to pay special attention to the mother's stores.  I was assuming that the story of the mothers would be reflected back in the story of the daughters somehow.  The four mothers were friends for many years.  They met monthly with their husbands to play the Chinese game mahjong.  They become close like family.<br /><br />When the book then goes from the mothers to their daughters.  The daughters struggle with being Chinese Americans.  Their mothers feel that they are loosing tradition and do not understand what it truly means to be from China.  The daughters feel that their mothers are old fashioned and can't let go of old Chinese ways.<br /><br />The book ends with chapters about the mothers.  After reading the trials and tribulations that each daughter is going through in her own life, the book tells the of trials and tribulations that the mothers went through in their own youth.  All during the book the daughters thought that their mothers did not understand anything about trouble in life.  The book shows that these mothers knew trials  and trouble all to well.  The mothers were just looking out for their daughters by trying to protect them from the same fate that they experienced.<br /><br />I did enjoy this book.  It would make an excellent book club book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I would love for everyone to read this heartwarming and good feeling book  ! I laughed and cried throughout the book.

1439190275|5.0|The new revised version of the Atkins diet is a great resource.  I like to know why diets are created, and this book is very specific about the science behind the low carb diet, and why in the long run, it is the healthiest way to eat.  I am slowly losing weight, which at my age has been impossible on any other plan;  I feel great...no afternoon slumps, and my clothes are fitting so much better.  This is  something I can do for life.
B009LDD5E0|1.0|I was a huge fan of the show during the previous seasons. I love the cast, the characters, their voices. The first six episodes are fairly strong. After that the show takes a complete nosedive. There is no plot. The old characters are no longer the characters you know. Characters like Rachel, Tina and Sam changed to the point where they felt like new unlikable characters. The new characters take over the show and they are completely uninteresting with recycled storylines. The show lucked out with the original cast, most of the new kids are poor actors and are not nearly as strong musically as the originals. Storylines only last for one episode and are then long forgotten. There is no overall plot for the season, other than the worn out \\"are they going to win this or that competition\\". The genuine nature the show once had was lost this season. Not to mention how personally offended I felt by quite a few of the episodes. They seemed classless and serious topics were brushed off far too easily. I wouldn't pay $15 for this season, much less $50.
1906735875|4.0|Bought this because well Dredd is awesome of course but also because like most people looking to collect an older series I don't feel like forking out hundreds for back issues so this was defiantly the way to go. As for the stories themselves I think there are definite pros and cons to the writing of the era, on one hand stories sometimes seem to abruptly end without much panning out but this can also be seen as a positive if you don't have time to read a drawn out epic. The cheesiness and comedy could also be a turn off to some, especially if you come into it expecting grim dark scifi. I personally didn't mind it though and thought it added to the charm and there were some genuinely funny lines of gallows humor from Dredd. Go into it as you would a B movie and you'll have fun.
0425242099|4.0|Excellent book.<br />Often when there is a lot of buildup to a couple over several books (in this case 9 books) the book winds up being a letdown. Not so in this case. Nalini Singh has a total winner in Kiss of Snow.<br /><br />The book is a bit slow, I think it wouldn't have seemed as slow if we hadn't been waiting for this story for so long. She took her time revealing them as a couple, letting them get to know each other as a man and a woman, dating, and taking the relationship in slower steps. She also gives us a side story of Walker and Lara that we can also enjoy and a lot of progress in the Psy Counsel/Changeling conflict.<br /><br />This book was so complete, so satisfying, I almost feel like it could be the end of the series. Doors are open, you can see new characters, new story in the making (and there is another book after this). But if you want a period at the end of a sentence, this book could be it. I've felt frustrated with a few of the books, like Singh had lost her way a bit, but this really left me with a satisfied smile on my face.<br /><br />My only complaint in the book is that Nalini Singh has too many &#34;S&#34; names. Sascha, Sienna, both living in Sierra Nevadas. I kept getting confused!
B002BVOYBW|5.0|unique take on the human condition: warmth, humor, pathos, long term commitment- or not, unconditional love. Character growth and redemption.  Early Johnny Depp doing a great set of bits that were done by silent comic greats-Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. look for Keaton /Chaplin posters in the background of a few scenes. How many movies made in Spokane, nice river and park scenes.
B0094K1K8I|5.0|Wonderful movies, wonderful actors and love how creepy and weird it is . The little girls in this is wonderful!
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|OK, this book gets you from beginning and holds you.  After reading the first chapter, you will NOT put this book down, period!<br /><br />I especially love Thiede's point of view writing: you truly feel like you are with the characters in real time as the story unfolds.  It's unlike many stories out there.<br /><br />Everything about this story was great and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a thrill ride.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|I really like John Scalzi's work. And especially when he imparts humor into the situations where some others might go on long winded philosophical treatises. His characters react like the humans they are, making them instantly likeable and identifiable. And I loved the little different homages (maybe imagined) to Sci-Fi on television.<br />After &#34;The Android's Dream&#34;, this is my favorite book from the author!<br /><br />Cheers!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Lots of history surrounded by a great story.  Well written and definitely worth reading.  I want to read more by this author!

B00CM9JIZ0|4.0|It's the same story for many QR fans, I as they watched and listened to one of their favourite bands disintegrate musically and finally totally over the last 15 years. I perservered as far as Tribe, which was OK, then got used to the idea that they used to be a great band, but I had to let them go.<br /><br />Then it all blew up. Tate was gone and the group was reborn. When was the last time I pre-ordered a record (answer....???? Er.... 30 years ago?), I wanted to show my support for the new QR. I had to wait a couple of weeks extra because I wanted the vinyl version but it was worth the wait.<br /><br />The real QR sound again, progressive hard rock, not that bland pulp Tate was making them play and record (well whoever actually recorded it) for the last 10 years. Todd La Torre is excellent and Scott Rockenfield drums like a demon. Finally the real QR guitar sound, played with passion aggression and energy. Wonderful. I only wish there was more, 34 minutes is light, but I suppose only by contemporary standards, and there is no filler here.<br /><br />So why 4 and not 5 stars? Well it's definitely a 4, really a 4.5, I mean I can't throw out a 5 star rating. That was Operation Mindcrime, the truly classic QR record.<br /><br />The vinyl even came with a CD, so there is really no reason not to get the turntable out and here this music on the real format!!

B007SGM084|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I did actually devour all three in the series rather quickly. In spite of the below average writing style, constant repetitiveness, and the frankly irritating demeanor of many of Ms. James' characters, I must admit to being thoroughly entertained. That being said, I did have a great deal of actual problems with this book.<br /><br />1. As mentioned before, it was difficult (for me at least) to get through this book without cringing a bit at the word choice. Words like \\"my inner goddess\\" (among many other things) are pretty cheesy and force the reader to either giggle or cringe at a moment when the author probably intended for her readers to be caught up in a moment of erotic bliss.<br /><br />2. I found the book to be a bit confused. Many people mistakenly refer to this book as BDSM. Having read a lot of real books in the bdsm genre, I can say that this is not really the case. However, it would also be untrue to say that this book isn't at least a little kinky. I can only assume that Ms. James chose not to go all the way to make the book more popular and acceptable to her readers. She also seems to put bdsm in a bad light. Whether she intended to do this or not, I can't be sure. She makes Christian a \\"dark\\" character, a character who is dark because of his desire for domination over a submissive woman. According to James, Anna must lead Christian to the light. She is the sweet and innocent virgin meant to lead him from his darkness to a world of \\"vanilla.\\" This plot all seems rather cheesy to me. It makes bdsm sound bad and implies that you have to be pretty messed up if you like it. In the next two books, the theme of sexual domination seems to slowly wane (although it does not go away completely) as romance takes over and Christian falls in love with Anna. The message is clear: Anna is taking Christian out of the darkness and away from his desire to \\"hurt\\" women.<br /><br />I find this message disturbing and frankly misleading. There are a lot of sadists out there who are great guys and have a lot of respect for women. They just need to find a woman, willing to engage in engage in S/M.<br /><br />3. That brings me to one of my biggest issues. I'm confused as to why James creates a relationship between someone like Christian and Anna. Anna, although at first somewhat intrigued by the idea of bdsm, is much more interested in \\"vanilla\\" sex. Of course there's nothing wrong with that; we can't all be kinky. However, it's clear that she's torn when she cries over a spanking and uses her safe word after being hit with a mere belt (which by the way is not even close to painful compared to the other instruments used in bdsm). At first she clearly consents to being hit, but then retreats, leaving Christian to believe that it is his \\"dark\\" tendencies which have driven her away. He is then forced to choose between Anna and his sexual needs. I know that in real life we don't end up with perfect relationships. But this is fiction. I expect the characters to at least be somewhat sexually compatible (especially when the genre is erotica). It's difficult for someone interested only in vanilla to have enjoyable sex with an individual who likes bdsm<br /><br />4. And that brings me to the next point. How much does the lifestyle actually mean to Christian? What role does he play in that lifestyle? In one part of the book he states that he's a sadist (maybe this was the second book, but I can't remember now). If he was a real sadist there's NO WAY he could engage in vanilla sex without being totally bored out of his mind. Sadists need to give pain. They need a masochist who is willing to not only take that pain, but also receive gratification from that pain. I find it hard to believe that Christian is a real sadist. Either that, or he is trying really hard to set aside his own needs to be with Anna. If the latter is true, that's pretty sad. Even if he was only someone interested in sexual domination without a tonof pain, he would probably still be interested in some pain...at the minimum a spanking (which Anna clearly can't put up with). In the end, it is still unclear whether Christian is a real sadist or just a dom.<br /><br />Overall, this trilogy was not without entertainment. The first one was my favorite of all three (the last two where a bit too lovey dovey for me). However, it is difficult to ignore the many small and also huge problems with the plot and characters. As entertainment it's fine; that's why I gave it the 3 stars. But after taking a closer look, there are just too many flaws.of pain, he would probably still be interested in some pain...at the minimum a spanking (which Anna clearly can't put up with).

B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Emotionally and intellectually risky, this book is a great read if you are willing to be upset and permanently haunted. It starts out light with lots of reasons to laugh on just about every page. But, then it becomes dark. I finished it in two days! The author's fresh writing style has me wanting to read everything she's ever written.
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|It's upsetting to have to do this but I was just not impressed with this album. I absolutely LOVE Rod. Love almost all of his songs..but just couldn't get into this CD. It's incredibly depressing. Half way through the CD I had to go look up to see if he got a divorce. Almost all of the songs are like this. Slow, and depressing lyrics about losing love. I enjoy more of his fast paced uptempo songs, and of course a few of the slower classics but there are only 2 songs on this album that have more of an upbeat tempo. The rest are slow \\"I love you but you left me\\" type stuff. Whenever I turn it on, the emotions of the songs are incredibly depressing. That's not what I want when I listen to Rod. I like feeling the nostalgia and sassyness to his songs. Not this. While the occasional love loss song or slow paced song is fine, almost the entire CD is filled with it. It's too \\"personal\\" about the singer. It's like listening to someone complain about their love life. I really wish this album was better and wish I could give it more stars..but I cant. I already upped it 1-2 stars simply because Rod is Awesome, but quite frankly, I can't see me listening to this CD again (and I already gave it a 2nd chance by listening to it fully twice...nuthin').

The unreality of the common citizen's knowledge and awareness of the world was like some bizarre science fiction story from an unknown world.
B008JFUO0Y|1.0|The first one was fun to watch and it was tongue and cheek like the Horror Classic of the 60's & 70's. This was just violence for the sake of violence for money.

0525478817|5.0|I was so damn excited when i got the book! I was kind of afraid that it wouldn't live up to my hyped up expectations. But it did. The characters were so real. I love them, not just the main characters.<br /><br />It was hilarious, joyous and heart wrenching at the same time. The jokes do really make you laugh out. The thing about this book is its sort of like an emotional blackmail. I knew i would cry when i read the book. Sadly, being mentally prepared didn't help at all. I've cried while reading books before, a few tears here and there. But this is the first time that I actually bawled my eyes out. It's also the first time I've my heart broken by a book.  Approaching the end of the book, I was just so sad that i couldn't cried anymore.<br /><br />Even the characters are just fiction, they just felt so real that you can't help but feel for them. This was a really amazing read. My words aren't good enough. But seriously, you've gotta read it!

B00CLD65X0|4.0|Downton has been that show that has sucked me in from the very first episode. I Feel as though I may not be a noble or a footman that I am able to relate to all of the characters. The one thing that i did have an issue with in season 3 is that there were some things that i saw coming but none the less i was still able to enjoy the season.

B0090SI582|1.0|This movie is about 85% crap!!! A lot of boring scenes. This movie needed A LOT more action and less of the predictable lovey dubby junk that has no importance to the movie. Plot was waaaaaaay too easy to figure out. I thought the battle with Silver Samurai was going to save this movie... but I was WRONG!!! The best part of this movie was about halfway through the ending credits with an extra scene.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|I wish that they could have found some happiness for Tess --instead she was doomed for a life of misery and suffering.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|The game is a lot of fun.  I like how there are a wide range of weapons, most of which were used in that time.  I wish there were easier ways to unlock weapons rather that purchase them, they are quite expensive.  Also, you will have to fork out cash to get some other items like med kits.  Overall a very fun game and a pretty good FPS for a tablet.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I love the product but it is slightly annoying that it asks me questions every time I turn my machine on - I just need to find a way to turn that off becuase it's like a guilt stab if you say no that you don't want to read the Bible.
1401233791|5.0|This first volume of KnightFall collects quite a lot of classic Batman material. This is wonderful for someone like me, who was only a little kid when these comics were first published, to gather this entire story arc in one compendium for the first time.<br /><br />There's a lot to take in here, so I would suggest reading this collection over several days. You get 630pgs of actual story, plus an additional 10pgs of advertisements and cover-art of the next volume in the KnightFall story arch. All things considered, I'd say this is an outstanding value for the large amount of work comprised within.<br /><br />Here is a material list of all the issues contained within this volume:<br /><br />Batman: Vengeance of Bane Special #1<br />Batman #491-500<br />Detective Comics #659-666<br />Showcase'93 #7 and 8<br />Batman: Shadow of the Bat #16-18<br /><br />The front and rear cover are sturdy, laminated paper. The actual pages of the book, however, are the exact same kind that would have been present in the comics of the early 90's. All of the artwork and coloring are completely unchanged, making this collection a real piece of nostalgia. The pages even have that distinct \\"comic book scent\\"!<br /><br />I actually prefer the pages to be in their original style. If you're an avid comic reader like me, you know that a lot of recent printings of old comics have \\"revised\\" or \\"updated\\" artwork and color schemes. I honestly don't like when this happens. It's a nice touch, but unnecessary. I much prefer to get these stories just as they appeared 20 years ago. This volume definitely accomplishes that!<br /><br />Enjoy your Reading!
B000AP04NI|5.0|OH what a beautiful morning - everything's going my way!  Oklahoma - the best musical ever.  I was 25 years old when it came out originally.  But remember the songs from years before.  You won't be disappointed with OKLAHOMA  - - OK!

B001FVV2X2|2.0|The concept of a government agency investigating paranormal activities is getting rather tired. I will say that the FX of this series is the best I've seen so far, but unfortunately it's not enough to counter the fact that every episode is exactly the same—&#34;I did an experiment exactly like this back in the day ...&#34;

0743497465|2.0|Dan Brown may be immensely popular, but his skills as a writer are deplorable.  At least in Angels and Demons and The Davinci Code, he was able to write thrillers with lots of action that were page turners.  Deception Point is nothing like that.  The plot, premise and execution are so utterly ridiculous that I am surprised I was able to make it through this novel.  To make it worse, he's just not a good writer from a technical standpoint.<br /><br /> In this silly novel, President Herney is seeking a difficult reelection.  His opponent, Senator Sexton's main mission in life is to bring down NASA.  This in itself is ridiculous.  What politician who has ever existed would make it their main platform to bring down NASA?  Does the term bigger fish to fry have any meaning here?  Tons of absurd conspiracies abound.  Dan Brown is certainly no stranger to conspiracies, but the ones in this novel make his others positively plausible in comparison.  Without giving away the big reveal, the NASA crew, including Senator Sexton's daughter, Rachel, travel to the Arctic circle for what is to be a massive revelation.  This novel was tough to get through and definitely below Dan Brown's other novels in quality.<br /><br />Carl Alves - author of Blood Street

B00AFQC4QC|5.0|The Luck of the Weissensteiners<br />(A Three Nation Trilogy)<br />By<br />Christoph Fischer<br /><br />This is a `Tale of Two Families' living their lives in the era up to and during World War 2. Life is simple but always a struggle--and it is about to grow worse. No one really sees the evil heading their way, in fact most people are in denial as the Plague of Anti-Semitism creeps across Europe like a deadly fog, overtaking country after country, leaving only death and devastation in its wake. The hatred infects everyone, turns friend against friend, family against family, husband against wife. Even entire Governments corrupt and will do anything to save themselves. Mr. Fischer has created a brilliant historical novel that is still too close for comfort and some of us may find difficult to read. The Weissensteiners are a Jewish family of weavers. They are masters of their craft and create exquisite tapestries that hang on the walls of the Nobles' castles and the home of one Countess in particular. Greta is one of two daughters and a son that make up Jonah Weissensteiner's family. When she meets her prince, Wilhelm Winkelemeier, a clerk in the local book store, Greta is swept off her feet and soon becomes pregnant. Eventually they marry, not knowing how this event will radically affect both of their families. Wilhelm is the first to bail out. Encouraged by his mother he takes their first born blond Aryan-looking son to cousins in Berlin, leaving a pregnant and trusting Greta with his family. Wilhelm's family,the Winkelemeiers, are farmers and as the Czechoslovakian government falls to the Nazis they see nothing wrong with expanding their holdings with confiscated Jewish neighbors' land. This all sets the stage for the greed, cruelty, persecution of not only the Jews, but Gypsies, homosexuals, and even the mentally ill. Mr. Fischer includes everyone in his tale of terror about man's inhumanity to man. But the pain and humiliation does not stop after the war. Familiesand friends are separated and moved around Europe like so much chattel. Even though I knew the characters are not real but drawn in Mr. Fischer's fertile imagination I found myself crying with these people in their misery, and then admiring them for their commitment to life, to their children, their families and friends. I could not stop reading this book, I wanted to know the next move of every character, especially Greta, and I highly recommend it to everyone. As a child I was raised in England. We had lots of air raids and rationing and discomfort but compared to what the European Jews and all the Displaced Persons suffered in those years, we were living in luxury. In my mind, dying once was not enough for those evil men who perpetrated these crimes against the minds, bodies, and souls of an entire race of Jewish men, women and children.<br />Mary Firmin, author Deadly Pleasures.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Its a game you keep playing over and over can't seem to shut the game down till you are finished.
B0092SQ5EG|3.0|I like Katy Perry, even though I am so far beyond her generation.  I even like her music; she's got a lot of talent and her videos are visually entertaining.  This was merely a long music video with most of her music and concerts during the year long tour.  Hard to class it as a movie.  It does get a bit interesting at the end when she gets emotional about her divorce.
B00DIFARQ6|5.0|I'm totally HOOKED on this game It passes the time when you are waiting , And the graphics...Totally Amazing. I'm even going to buy the Full version.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|I am not a racing fan so much as I appreciate good bluray transfers of movies, and this is one.  There is virtually no story in the movie, it is 98% racing so racing fans should love it.  I bought it, like Grand Prix (a more engaging movie IMHO), for the beautiful image and audio transfer.  Colors and details are fantastic- I am seeing the grain of the film.  The 7.1 audio is better than Grand Prix.  Do not hesitate.
B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|I love Colin Farrell despite his &#34;bad boy&#34; image he really is a great actor and hes perfect for this role!<br />I thought the story was good it had lots of twists and turns you don't expect and the acting and cast<br />was excellent! I also liked how it was kind of &#34;dark and sinister.&#34; Great love story too!!!!

B002QXIMY0|5.0|Okay so I'm an old Anthrax fan. When I heard this album back in '87 or so, I was like &#34;what is this?!&#34;. Back then this was one of the heavier thrash albums I'd heard. Joey's voice is in top form here, I love that they allowed the bass guitar to come thru in the recordings, Charlie was at the top of his game behind the drums and (the best part for me): Dan Spitz was still in the band! In my opinion, he was the reason they were so heavy and the solos were fantastic. Get this edition of the album, the sound is stellar and the concert vid they include is worth it!
0007466064|5.0|I have been thoroughly entrenched in George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire since April.  I can't wait to find out what happens to Arya, Jon, Tyrion, Sam, etc.  A Dance with Dragons continues the story and I've completed it and moved on to the next.  George R. R. Martin can't write fast enough for me and his many fans.
B002APU580|5.0|If you are a PRIDE AND PREJUDICE fan, think you will enjoy this enactment of it.  Although we all love Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, Matthew Macfadyen plays a delicious Darcy as well.  Keira Knightley is a lovely Elizabeth Bennett.  The scenery and sets seem very realistic and this movie is a visual delight.<br /><br />Other actors who illumined scenes for me are Rosamund Pike as Jane, Elizabeth's old sister and Donald Sutherland as the father.  Of course, Judi Dench as a noblewoman was a welcome addition as well.  I hadn't realized that Carey Mulligan played the youngest Bennett sister.<br /><br />It seemed the movie clung pretty closely to the plot.  To use Chatsworth as Mr. Darcy's home was an inspired choice.<br />The movie is worth watching just for the visual charm.  It seemed realistic, like it was really happening in the 1800's.  That's probably one of the highest compliments one can pay a movie - you don't feel like you are watching a movie.  This is a favorite film of mine - one I can watch over and over again.

B00BBI9WD6|5.0|When I was young, I enjoyed the Horatio Hornblower series by C.S. Forester. This story brings those excellent tales to mind and combines science fiction's universe building element with all the swashbuckle anyone could want. Beginning with the competent and compelling Honor Harrington to her circle of loyal subordinates and the believable world they inhabit, this book is worth the time.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys space opera and who remembers Hornblower fondly. My thanks to Amazon for featuring it.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The price is fantastic and the basic functionality is there, but there are two major failings preventing a five star rating here.<br /><br />YOUTUBE MIRRORING:<br />The image transmitted to my TV does not match the actual YouTube video. Specifically,the image is \\"zoomed in\\",resulting in the top, bottom, left, and right being cut off. This is particularly noticeable in videos with text near the bottom. I tweaked all the settings (Full Screen Zoom, Auto-Resize) but neither remediated the issue. Worth noting that I tried this on three separate devices (Nexus 7, Galaxy S3, and Chromebook) and all had the same issue.<br /><br />VOLUME:<br />It would really be a lot better if the volume when chromecasting would stay consistent. Regardless of the device it goes to max volume when you cast for the first time, which means you have to scramble to reduce the noise to manageable levels. Worth noting that the Nexus and Galaxy allowed for adjusting volume through the default volume controls while the Chromebook did not.<br /><br />The volume issue is manageable, but the zoom problem is a big deal. I'll be troubleshooting with some other TVs to see if the problem persist and will adjust my score accordingly if it is just THIS TV that is the issue.<br /><br />7/26/2013 Update:<br />It turns out it is specific to the TV. I tried it on a second TV and had the same issue but it was easy to resolve with by changing the display setting from 16:9 to \\"Scan\\". Unfortunately no setting tweaks were able to resolve anything for the TV downstairs (only has 16:9,Zoom, and 4:3 options)so I don't think there is a likely solution. The TV is likely the guilty culprit as opposed to the chromecast, so raised this to four stars.

B00BUADSMQ|4.0|It's not closer than the original movie from this franchise or the last one, but it is more entertained than the second or the third one, because all the action was developed in Mother Russia, and that puts more spice to the action and relative freshness to the viewer at watching a new  environment, than watch over and over again the city of New York or Washington, well know for everyone in all the action movies.

B008YW5RH2|3.0|This is a really good tennis game, especially for a free one. I like the serving and ball striking abilities but wish there was more shot selections.<br /><br />Oct 2013 - Update my review from 4 to 3 stars.  I've had this game since July and it's gotten worse with the update rather than better.  The ads ... OMG ... every single time you start the game. And now, the worse anti-virus ad... after you pick that you don't want your device scanned, it comes up with a big screen that says my device may contain a virus (I've run my own anti-virus app and it's always virus free).  Also, I'm not finding that it's getting any more difficult as my level goes up.  I'm at level 9 ChI ampion and whenever I start a new league play, the first 3 opponents are always the same. The 1st opponent always just pops the ball up and the 2nd isn't much better. I don't know about everyone else, but I cannot ever get into any tournament except Friendly ... no matter<br />which one I choose.  I've won the Friendly 20 times and it won't let me play either the Olympics or World Cup.<br />And how does the points work in the league games.  Whenever I win a match all I get is one point and one win, which means the most I can get is 6 points. All the other players have over 15 points, so if I ever tie with any player, I always come in 2nd even though I've won every game in the match.  Is this a bug?  I've reinstalled once and it's still the same.

B00D5YNQMW|3.0|I agree with the previous reviewers in that this is an awesome concert by the group. They are absolutely on fire and the video and sound is excellent.  The reason I'm giving it only 3 stars is that the interruptions with the interviews between songs.  Were it not for that, I would have given 5 stars.  I wish they would release a \\"deluxe\\" version where the entire show is not interrupted and the interviews are in bonus material.  It would be nice to put this DVD on at a party and not worry about having to pick up the remote to skip the interviews.

Vote this to the top so it will drown out all the non-review bad bs!<br /><br />----<br /><br />I have a Chromecast installed on my TV right now. Here is my review:<br /><br />The day before I bought ChromeCast, *I* (a 16 yr software engineer) had spent FOUR HOURS troubleshooting our own YouTube streaming capabilities via XBox 360+PC (via Playon and TVersity) and via the Roku. I finally got it to work, but then I contrasted that to how I unpacked, plugged in and did a little welcome steps and was up and running in literally less than 5 minutes on the Chromecast, with superior quality to boot.<br /><br />***<br />The best news is that my 72 yr-old mother plugged in a Chromecast herself, launched it, set it up, and was using it *WITHOUT ASSISTANCE OR TRAINING* in under 5 minutes, and the same w/ my 7 year-old.<br />***<br /><br />Do you know how gratifying the experience was to both of them?! My 7 yrold couldn't stop laughing and my mom said it was the best technical experience she's ever had. She didn't even need a manual.<br /><br />It's simply a next-level disruptive experience. I have never been able to use iTV as it's Mac-ecosystem only (and we have no apple products in this house), but I want to now, just so I can know how the usability stacks up. ChromeCast is simply the easiest to use video streaming service I have personally used and using a tablet or laptop as the controller is *far* faster (and easier!) than navigating complex menus and touch-typing via a remote (roku) or XBox 360 controller.<br /><br />The kids just had an angry birds competition on the TV for the first time ever using their Galaxy tablets as the controllers. So now Chromecast is competing directly with our XBox 360, at least for web games.<br /><br />The Chromecast is *so* disruptive that my parents would have bought a cheap tablet if they didn't already have laptops and, well, smartphones, just to control it.<br /><br />They didn't want to mess with netflix since it couldnt be streamed on their TV. Now, my dad was like, \\"I wonder if I can cancel DirectTV now?\\" rut ro Bad comment for someone who's just demoing a device for the first time.and, well, smartphones, just to control it.<br /><br />They didn't want to mess with netflix since it couldnt be streamed on their TV.

B008KP6ENE|5.0|I got this when it was a free app of the day and it is surprisingly fun.  It doesn't run as well on my phone (but it runs on gingerbread, so that could be the problem) as it does on the Kindle Fire but it looks fantastic.  My daughter loves the main character and has named him Smiles.  She is always stealing the buttons we collect to buy him clothes and dress him up.  Some of the levels are pretty challenging.  Overall, just a good looking, fun game.

B00COGZ8FU|2.0|This had the potential to be a really good movie but the casting, scripting and acting were all shoddy.  Tom Cruise would be better in the role of Frank Burns if they ever remake M*A*S*H, he's more of a sniveling has been than a tough guy.  All of the actors are capable of much better performances so I'm blaming the directer for the stiff, quirky, overly dramatic pauses and sequences.  The dialog was comedic at times.  And the Zek, the scariest thing about the Zek was believing his dentures held up  to gnaw his fingers off.  He's more like a senile granpa with soiled diapers.  I'd really like to see more Reacher movies, but the casting, script and directing need to be improved.  I want to give this more than 2 stars, but just cannot.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|If you're looking for a coming of age tale, a survivor story, a tragedy, or an exploration of cross-cultural travel FORGET IT!<br /><br />For those unaware Life of Pi is a highly allegorical almost bizarre story about: stories, religion, nature, danger, family, and well pretty much anything you can think of.<br /><br />Its not really my kind of book, I'm a bit of a traditionalist, however if you're looking for something above the ordinary this is the one for you fo' sure.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I love this app because of it's persistence. Making a person wake up to math problems to help wake the hell is genius and annoying at the same time. It works. Nice snooze button too!
B00DGN51O8|3.0|This was entertaining but definitely not anything special.  CGI was pretty interesting.  Might be a bit much for younger children.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|This is my second Skagen watch. Gorgeous design. Perfect size face. Incredibly thin and light. I love the trademark adjustable mesh band which gives you the perfect fit in seconds. Sharp enough to wear to work, casual enough to go with jeans. Love it.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Doctor Who dose it again.  Season 6 is just as awesome as the previous seasons.  Great fun, adventures, and even some humor.  Totally recommend.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|I find the humor in this movie and in Family Guy TV show. It's not to everyone's taste but I don't find Adam Sandler funny, so live and let live.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|These two are very good together.  There are some absolutely hilarious laugh out loud scenes. I would definitely recommend but not with children around.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Having fun with this app.  Looking forward to customizing my horse!  I like the animation of the horse. Would like to be able to pick the color of my starter horse.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|A movie should be made based on this book. Classic sci-fi, as good today as when it was originally written.
B008NEVP1S|5.0|What can I say? Her music speaks to me and I like to sing along to it. The lyrics are good, which is a big plus
B0046B4VXQ|5.0|I like seeing the movie \\"Carrie\\" form 1976.<br />Being a child in  the 70's, it showed me what the decade was like.  I have always enjoyed all of Stephen King work's.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Its the perfect combination of actual science, historical occurrences and science fiction with intricate pieces brought together nicely in the end.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Quick read but I expected more insight and less fluff.  It almost seemed to be a stream if consciousness which I do not prefer.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the former version of this app. This new updated version is just awful! It's caused nothing but problems on my kindle. I have deleted it and will be looking for something different.

B003R0LBVW|3.0|Recommended by a cousin, I thought I'd give this a try. Right from the beginning, I could tell that there was an unusual and interesting style to the writing. But I also found it to be a struggle to continue reading it. Only because of the recommendation did I push myself to the end. The end was worth it, though. The last couple of chapters held my attention and everything before then came together to make it an good story and underline the meaning of the title. Still, not a book I'd want to read again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's fun and everybody likes it but I can't beat all my friends because every time I almost get there something knocks me over
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I think it's fine.  I love/hate how it tells me &#34;you have x hours and minutes before this alarm&#34; when I am tucking in at night.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I am reading this now and as usual the premise, character and engrossing scientific storytelling are terrific. Looking forward to the author's notes at end so I can find out how much of the science is fact. I have learned a lot from this series.

B00B7Y0206|3.0|This was a good app . It's very organized . I like the order of this application and how it's made . But the worst part about it is that you have to pay $2 to be able to download any videos and that sucks !!!

B007EC27QM|4.0|I love this app. It's easy to use and the big numbers are great. Totally worth the .99 I paid for it. Thank You
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I play this game so much that my mom got into it, next my 6 year old sister, then my 4 year old sister, and last my 2 year old brother as unbelievable as it may sound,lol. I do have one complaint, sometimes my baby brother deletes my apps when he is playing with my kindle, and every time I 're-download it everything is the same. Except for this last time. And the double coins are not worth the purchase, it's not a one time purchase. I had to buy it over 3 times because even though there is a replenish double coins in the store, it doesn't work. It always says previous purchase not found. If you're reading this can I please get<br /> my double coins back, my mom refuses to buy it again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game its very fun.....download it now ! :) craxy love fun peace people please download it...very fun
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Just what one needs on vacation. Twists and turned in unexpected ways all the way through. And leaves you with a most uneasy kind of feeling in the end.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Picked up my unit after a long ordeal with Best Buy yesterday. Didn't have much time to play with it once I got home, but here's what I did find out:<br /><br />1. It works as advertised from both a laptop and my phone. Don't have a tablet to test it with but I imagine it would be the same experience as the phone. I was able to watch several youtube clips and netflix without loosing connectivity. BTW, I'm using a linsys WRT54G running DD-WRT on comcast in a 2400 sq ft 1 story house. The tv is at one end and the router at the other. I still get 4 out of 5 bars of signal on this unit, unlike my smart bluray player that gets 1-2 out of 5 bars of signal in the same room.<br /><br />2. I have a 2 year old Sharp LED but apparently the HDMI ports don't have power. Luckily the usb port was right there. The cord for the usb cable comes with a velcro tie wrap to take up the excess length so it remains out of sight.<br /><br />3. Music streaming from my phone was pretty cool. The song, cover art, artist name, etc are all displayed on the tv screen and I was able to control the volume also. Was unable to find a way to play \\"side-loaded\\" (songs on your sd card) songs though. Hopefully there will be an update to do so in the future, If not, im sure somebody will figure it out.<br /><br />That's all I have for now. I wish I'd bought more for my kids rooms (to control their programming remotely). Looks like i'll be waiting a while for that. Oh yeah, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ONE OF THESE AT BEST BUY, BUT YOUR STORE IS SHOWING NO INVENTORY, CALL! I called mine and was told that they had 6 even though the website said \\"ship to store 3 - 5 days\\". They weren't even on the floor when I got there; just sitting on the counter in the pc department because there hadn't been a shelf made for them. I'll update more as I learn.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Absolutely explosive. The first episode sets the pace for an action packed season. One of my favorite shows on the same level with breaking bad.
B000S0GYRU|5.0|Artsy, well directed classic. Recommend to any horror buffs.A must have in any lbrary and this is a very good edition.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Thrilling scripts, beautifully shot scenes and some fantastic acting! I am absolutely looking forward to watching Season 3 this winter.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|A wonderful film about a not so nice time periord in our recent past. Great acting by the whole cast, there were new comers and the great Cicely Tyson. Everyone should see this film and appreciate what so many of these African-American women had to listen to and endure as &#34;The Help&#34;. Yes, they were loved by many a family but more were disrespected because of the color of their skin and it was hard to watch knowing this took place not so long ago.
B0027Z9C2I|5.0|This is one of our favorites!  Loved the cast, the music, setting!!! This movie never gets old. We saw it on Broadway and also in L.A.  The movie is just as entertaining as the live performance.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Graphics are great.  Load times are just OK.  Game play is quite fun.<br /><br />...but it is always asking/suggesting you purchase extras.<br /><br />I got it for free, so I understand they want to make some money.  But this is also used as brand awareness to push users to see the new movie and buy more despicable me stuff.  Therefore, I expected less &#34;must buy extras&#34; push.<br /><br />I played on Kindle Fire HD
030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl is Gillian Flynn's biggest hit, in development as a movie, and so should be the best.  I couldn't wait to read it.  But...<br /><br />Her previous book, Dark Places, is a five star book by Gillian Flynn. A reader may not be 100% thrilled with the resolution, but the reader is kept turning pages nonetheless.  In Dark Places, we don't really know what happened until the very end. I read Sharp Objects twice, and it also keeps the reader turning pages.  Twists keeps coming until the final pages.<br /><br />Gone Girl is riveting in the first section. One knows something isn't kosher, but doesn't know what.  Unfortunately, Flynn has decided to resolve the mystery halfway into the book and that makes the last half much less interesting.  There are some little things here and there, but the book devolves into a procedural for the second half.<br /><br />I do think Ben Affleck is perfectly cast as the male lead, and Fincher as the director. But many have criticized Flynn for writing unlikable characters, and this book really has no one likable in a major role. Affleck is playing a character who is described as having a face you want to punch, and his puppy-dog arrogance is just perfect.  Maybe cast his wife, Jennifer Garner, as the pretty perfectionist cold-fish wife.  She'd be perfect as well.<br /><br />I hope her next book is a real mystery. I kept hoping something would happen during the last 200 pages, some crazy twist or surprise... but nothing ever did.  The very, very end might be considered a twist by some, but it was just what I expected.... Flynn has never written such an obvious book before and I hope she doesn't do so again.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It's too confusing in my opinion. I hate the updated version. I mean, what was wrong with the original version? Even though it was free I think it was a waste of money.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|GREAT MOVIE. KEEP IT ON THE LIST. IT IS HARD TO FIND GREAT MOVIES ON YOUR BLUE DISC LIST. THIS WAS A GOOD ONE.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|I started with the Free version then paid to get the Pro version, since it included sound (it was only two bucks then)<br /><br />It works great.  I have two Foscam wireless webcams and use this software on my Kindle Fire HD. I can easily view the cameras from inside my home network or any wireless connection outside my home.<br /><br />It opens quick, will show both cameras at once (or individually).  You can listen and talk through it (though talking is poor, likely due to wireless connection).<br /><br />It also enables a lot of the camera features like alarms and email/video recording.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|The concept for the show is sophisticated and centers on adult themes yet has great action sequences. The production quality is on the level of a Hollywood movie. The writing is excellent, the directing is excellent and the acting terrific. This is some of the best television ever.

B000B589JI|3.0|For the duration i have had this canister it went through a few phases.<br /><br />Phase one: Brand new out of the packaging, looks and feels amazing.<br /><br />Phase two: Minor scratches and a little bit of warping Zippo lettering starts to come off but no really issues.<br /><br />Phase three: The loop connecting the canister to the ring and clip warped and became very loose, slight rusting appeared<br /><br />Phase four: Flint holder broke, canister started leaking significantly (fixed by using teflon tape)<br /><br />Phase five: canister is still good all accessories are useless, clip broke.<br /><br />Overall i have had this for over 4 months as of writing this review and i can say the canister holds up, replace everything else with stronger stuff from hardware stores and itll be just fine

B005C0DHEY|5.0|The fracking industry and those in bed with it are helping to ruin our planet. Recently it was revealed that the fracking industry and its allies in the government spying and covert ops agencies view the Gasland moviemakers and anti-fracking people as \\"insurgents\\" who should be handled using military counter-insurgency methods. Kudos to the makers of Gasland and all who stand up against Big Coal, frackers, the oil industry, Monsanto, and all earth destroyers. But beware, the earth destroyers are people destroyers too, and they don't fight fair.
B005LAIH2C|4.0|Ever wonder what happened to Hansel & Gretel after they escaped the witch's house? Well they sure as hell didn't get reunited with their dad! Not according to this modern take on the tale.<br /><br />I'm sure there are purists out there cringing in their fairytale-loving boots at this gory retelling of a children's classic. Me - I love them. Fairytales were originally dark and gory until Disney got hold of them and cleaned up their image. I mean, come on - witches eating children for dinner is pretty dark.<br /><br />And do beware; this one definitely isn't for the kiddies. It's super dark, bloody and full of language and sexual innuendos.<br /><br />There are two major things I loved about this movie - Jeremy Renner, and the super cool irreverence of it all. The movie knows it's taking the piss and doesn't really care.<br /><br />Starring Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton in the title roles, Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters, fast-forwards a decade after the original story. The siblings are now adults with their own business - hunting and killing witches. They are Sam and Dean Winchester of the Middle Ages, siblings hunting down evil, with just as many humorous touches as Supernatural (of which I am a HUGE fan).  For instance, seems all that sugar Hansel consumed at the witch's cottage made him a diabetic. I literally laughed out loud when at the end of the movie, poor Hansel almost loses the battle as he goes into a diabetic coma. Foiled by candy - who would have thought it!<br /><br />Then you have Gretel almost getting raped by the townsfolk but then Edward comes along and rescues her. Edward the hero rides again! But instead of sparkling, this Edward is a troll who works for the witches. Doesn't stop Gretel wondering if perhaps Edward is her true love after all.  And as someone who can swear like a fishmonger's wife myself at times, I had to laugh at the coarse language in a fairytale.<br /><br />Over the last decades, witches have become hip in Hollywood. Instead of being villains, they've become the heroes, or at least, the beautiful side-kick to the heroes. Think Bonnie in The Vampire Diaries, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Willow in Buffy the Vampire Slayer...<br /><br />Hansel and Gretel brings back the super ugly witches (even if one is played by the super hot Famke Jansen uglied up with makeup). These witches make the Wicked Witch of the West look like a Girl Scout selling cookies. There was one question the movie left me with. Does having sex in a healing pool act like a condom?<br /><br />All in all, a much better retelling than Snow White and the Huntsman, or Red Riding Hood.d of being villains, they've become the heroes, or at least, the beautiful side-kick to the heroes.

B008TRH5N6|5.0|It's evident that to shift our &#34;outside world&#34; we have to begin to shift our internal world and the way we look at and process our current &#34;life situations&#34;.<br /><br />Overall the book is very good with lots of examples and ways to address different parts of life, from relationships to money to health issues. You will get the message much earlier in the book and the rest of it are examples and reminders of how it can be applied in a variety of situations.<br /><br />There are a some Christian and Biblical references but I didn't find them off putting. The author just as equally counter-balances them by describing the notion of God as &#34;Life&#34; or &#34;Life Force&#34; or &#34;Infinite Intelligence&#34;, etc. He certainly makes a conscious effort to keep it non-denominational.<br /><br />I feel that the value in these books is that they keep returning our attention to these simple truths that are so often overwhelmed by the deluge of life. I found that the best way to read this book is to not rush it.. In this book, it's not about &#34;finishing it&#34; but about putting it into practice... I found that reading a little each day or night and letting the philosophy sink in, provides a constant reminder to practice it daily, allowing you the time to instill this new method of thinking as a habit.<br /><br />I feel this book has helped me be mentally conscious so that I can more actively create the world around me and that's it's mission. As I alluded to earlier, life is fast and furious and it comes at you willy-nilly. Our attention is always hammered on what is happening to us and what we're experiencing... instead of what we're creating. However you make the shift to being more conscious, more purposeful & realizing your thoughts very much matter... however you do that, is quite valid.<br /><br />This book will convince you WHY you should, give you some useful How-To's and VALIDATE your infinite potential.<br /><br />What more could you ask for?
B005S9ELY4|3.0|Based on a true story (however loosely), the movie begins in 1949 Los Angeles, with gangster Mickey Cohen (played by Sean Penn) trying to run the city with the help of his crooked cops, paid for judges and politicians and a gang of thugs willing to act as executioner on his behalf. You know, typical gangster fare. Even the introduction of the team of cops willing to take him down is pretty typical of a mob movie.<br /><br />But where this movie gets a little different is the lengths the police will go to take down Mickey Cohen - almost becoming gangsters themselves as they operate outside the law - all in a bid to ultimately uphold the law.<br /><br />Sergeant John O'Mara (played by Josh Brolin) heads up this team of cops. He's a former World War II soldier who wants to get rid of the mob out of LA so he can live in a peaceful city with his family (his wife is heavily pregnant throughout much of the movie).<br /><br />Now I could give you a blow-by-blow (and there is lots of blowing apart in the movie) account, but if you've read my book reviews, you'll know that's not how I do things.<br /><br />When I chose this movie, I chose it for my husband who, like most men, loves any movie that involves lots of fighting and lots of blood loss (there's a reason his favourite actor is Bruce Willis). I really didn't think I would like it at all, and was all prepared to zone out on my phone while he had his little testosterone fill.<br /><br />And I did zone out, for the first quarter of the movie but then I found myself looking up more often, and asking lots of questions. I got the obligatory eye-roll that told me I should have been paying attention from the start, so I had to try to pick up the trail myself.<br /><br />Maybe I was being a bit shallow, but my interest levels did pique when Ryan Gosling became the focal point of the movie. Hey, don't judge me. He's pretty to look at. Ryan is one of the Gangster Squad but he's having an affair with one of Mickey Cohen's girls (played by the stunning Emma Stone).<br /><br />The action was a little over-the-top at times, particularly the dead-eye-dick shooting in the midst of a storm of automatic bullets. Sean Penn was a little cartoonish in his role as Mickey Cohen. I much prefer it when they show dual sides of the villain. Not everyone is all good, just as not everyone is entirely bad. We all have elements of both in us and it depends which side we feed more.<br /><br />But as pure entertainment, it was quite good, as long as you suspend your belief and remember it is only `loosely' based on truth.<br /><br />Worth watching just for Ryan Gosling, though if he weren't in it, I would probably have stuck to the phone.layed by the stunning Emma Stone).<br /><br />The action was a little over-the-top at times, particularly the dead-eye-dick shooting in the midst of a storm of automatic bullets.

B0090SI582|4.0|Prior to the release of X-Men: First Class, the X-Men franchise had been on slippery slope.  Both X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine left a great deal to be desired, especially coming off the critical and commercial successes of X-Men and X2: X-Men United.  However, to the credit of Marvel and Fox, neither company gave up on the franchise and have apparently \\"righted the ship\\" after the (mostly) embraced addition of First Class in 2011.  Even though the later films were faltering, the franchise's main star never shied away from the role that put him on the map.  Aside from Robert Downey Jr., there is no more important face to a comic book franchise than Hugh Jackman.  It's difficult to imagine another actor ever taking over the role of Logan/Wolverine, and despite the major flaws throughout the X-Men films, it's always been a pleasure to watch the evolution of Jackman's character.  In this his sixth appearance as the character and second solo adventure, Jackman once again stars as Marvel's beloved mutant superhero in The Wolverine.<br /><br />***MINOR PLOT DETAILS / POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br /><br />Directed by James Mangold (Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma), The Wolverine stars Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine, who is mentally broken down after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand.  Constantly haunted by visions of his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Logan struggles to find meaning in his life - until he is paid a visit from Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a woman with the ability to see the future.  She informs Logan that Ichirō Yashida, a man Logan saved in Japan when the atom bomb was dropped on Nagasaaki in 1945, is dying and wishes to say his final goodbye.  Once in Japan, Yashida informs Logan that he can remove his healing mutation and allow him to finally die - to Logan's surprise.  Fearful for the safety of Yashida's granddaughter (who stands to inherit the family empire after his death), Mariko (Tao Okamoto), Logan takes on the task of protecting her from a group of hired assassins.  Will Yun Lee, Svetlana Khodchenkova, Ken Yamamura, and Hiroyuki Sanada also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />***END MINOR PLOT DETAILS / POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br /><br />It's relatively safe to say Hugh Jackman was born to play the role of Wolverine.  There is literally no scene to be found in this film - or any other X-Men film - where Jackman's portrayal of Logan is uninteresting or bland.  No, this isn't the Wolverine that many of us know and love from the comic books, but the cinematic version of the character borders on the brooding, temperamental character just enough to satisfy the needs of the plot throughout the course of the franchise.  For the most part, the attitude is right, the overall look of the character is acceptable, and Jackman's Australian accent is completely absent - not mention he's ripped beyond belief.  These vital characteristics continue to allow Jackman to excel at the cinematic role that's he's made famous.  Hopefully, Jackman will continue to answer to the call to play this character well beyond next summer's X-Men sequel.<br /><br />Outside of the praise to Hugh Jackman, The Wolverine is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of plot vs. characters.  The plot of the film is relatively simple and doesn't try to do too much, allotting plenty of time for character development and story progression.  However, the plot severely lacks the presence of a prominent villain.  For all of its flaws, X-Men Origins at least had Victor Creed (Live Schreiber) and William Stryker (Danny Huston) in the driver's seat as clearly visible villains.  The Wolverine's main antagonist is split amongst a handful of characters (and an endless amount of thugs) that is rarely threatening to the well-being of Logan and his abilities.  Speaking of his abilities, Logan is kind of, sort of stripped of his powers (as seen in the trailers, so it's not like this is a spoiler).  This makes for the most bothersome and cluttered portion of the plot, which rarely makes sense, and there's little doubt the film would have been even better had the filmmakers not incorporated it.  Regardless, the Silver Samurai rears his ugly head as a disappointing variation of the classic villain - and even more disappointing is that the character's appearance is specifically reserved for a climactic showdown, meaning he's absent for the majority of the film.  Despite what you think you know about this character and regardless of who plays what on the credit sheet, there is plenty of cloud and misdirection that significantly ignores the comic book version.  So, if you're a major fan of this particular villain, you might want to tapper your expectations.<br /><br />Oddly enough, The Wolverine doesn't seem as action-packed in comparison to previous X-Men films.  Still, there is plenty of action to go around, full of chase sequences and a ton of bad guys bitin' the dust - along with a pretty intense bullet train sequence that is visually impressive, even if it is unrealistic.  Surprisingly, there is quite a bit of downtime between action sequences, which is certainly welcomed and creates for a much more balanced film experience.  Typically, previous X-Men films use their unaccounted free space to incorporate cameos for characters that fans have been clamoring to see - such as Gambit or Juggernaut.  For the most part, The Wolverine is cameo free, making for a sustaining flow of drama, action, and brief moments of humor - which include a pretty humorous scene where Logan is taking a bath.<br /><br />Overall, The Wolverine is a welcome addition to the X-Men franchise and serves as a great continuation after the events of the sub-par third installment, X-Men: The Last Stand.  While that particular film was a bit of a dud, it's nice to see this new standalone adventure didn't completely ignore that film's events. Hugh Jackman continues to own the role of Logan and this character continues to be one of the most entertaining comic book heroes on the big screen.  For once, it was nice to see a film that didn't revolve around the \\"mutant crisis,\\" which will no doubt be the center of attention in the franchise's next film, X-Men: Days of Future Past.  And - a word of advice:  don't you dare move from your seat until you see the additional scene that happens about midway through the credits.  There's absolutely no debating the fact that this scene alone is worth the price of admission.  It will set up next summer's sequel, and will leave a gigantic smile on the face of every single hardcore X-Men movie and comic book fan out there.<br /><br />GRADE:  B<br />FNDNreview.comt, which rarely makes sense, and there's little doubt the film would have been even better had the filmmakers not incorporated it.  Regardless, the Silver Samurai rears his ugly head as a disappointing variation of the classic villain - and even more disappointing is that the character's appearance is specifically reserved for a climactic showdown, meaning he's absent for the majority of the film.  Despite what you think you know about this character and regardless of who plays what on the credit sheet, there is plenty of cloud and misdirection that significantly ignores the comic book version.  So, if you're a major fan of this particular villain, you might want to tapper your expectations.<br /><br />Oddly enough, The Wolverine doesn't seem as action-packed in comparison to previous X-Men films.  Still, there is plenty of action to go around, full of chase sequences and a ton of bad guys bitin' the dust - along with a pretty intense bullet train sequence that is visually impressive, even if it is unrealistic.

B007HACDLK|5.0|I was so sorry to hear about Vince Flynn's passing that I went out and downloaded his latest book.  He was an outstanding author and this book did not disappoint.
B000002UD7|5.0|Some people call 'Very' the quintessential PSB album and it's close, but I'd have to say it's this one (the new album, 'Electric' comes close also). This is where the boys take everything from their debut album please, and ramp it up to another level. Not just the music, I think this is also the first album where Neil's lyrics really come into their own. Admittedly, some of the sounds are a little dated now, but this album is still a classic and the start of the PSB 'Imperial Phase' - to me, that never ended :-)  Here's the tracks.<br /><br />1. One More Chance - 'Your so extreme, I want to take you home with me' ... A great 'up' song to open the album. Screeching tire samples, very of it's time and great lyrics. Still stands up well today.<br />2. What Have I Done to Deserve This? - Neil improbably sings about breaking up with Dusty Springfield. I mean why? They would make a great couple. Simply a classic PSB song and the addition of Ms. Springfield elevates it to a whole new level.<br />3. Shopping - Oh, the poor people who though this song was about shopping (probably including Mrs. Thatcher). It's no, so there!<br />4. Rent - For those who think Neil and Chris are at their best making dance music, listen to this. Breathtakingly simple and breathtakingly beautiful.<br />5. Hit Music - It's always been my least favorite song on the album. It's just a bit too literal (am I missing something?) and not particularly clever. I don't hate it, but it just doesn't feel like it sits well here.<br />6. Another one that feels out of place, yet it still works. Very mournful, very slow and sad. Likely written about the AIDS epidemic and it makes me sad.<br />7. It's a Sin - What do I say that hasn't been said already. From the opening '20 seconds and counting', this song gets into your head and doesn't let go.<br />8. I Want to Wake Up - As hooky as a boat full of fishermen. Again, a little dated, but still sounds good today. Great use of vocal effects.<br />9. Heart - Something the boys don't do often enough, a simple, straightforward love song. It's so lovely and so danceable. They wanted to offer this song to Madonna, but were too nervous. I'd love to have heard her do it!<br />10. Kings Cross - A downbeat, beautiful, poignant closer to a great album.<br /><br />Conclusion - New to the Pet Shop Boys? Buy this!ng the boys don't do often enough, a simple, straightforward love song. It's so lovely and so danceable. They wanted to offer this song to Madonna, but were too nervous.

B00DAXYNEI|5.0|I found that I was riveted to the series - stayed up too late at night watching three or four episodes in one sitting
B0012DK4ZU|4.0|This movie gets you involved right away with the two brothers and the tragic death of there parents. There is also the best friend that drives an ice cream truck. As soon as you get to know the main characters, real weird stuff starts happening and you can't help but get sucked into this picture.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I highly recommend this book. Do you know the saying of you could never pick a favorite book? That wasn't always true for me. As a teenager (hard to think I was ever one of those) I was fascinated by this book. It encapsulated my imagination in ways no other book could and I had read quite a few books in my teenage years. This book was my favorite book. For a time period there, I would read it once a year. I think over the course of the years I have read this book 15 to 20 times. I have lost count. This truly is a classic. It was thought provoking, engaging and very psychological. You related with Ender and the other children as they went through their training and mind games that the adults put them through. You feel for Ender as he struggles against bullies and looks for the definitive way to end conflicts. In the end though, perhaps things weren't quite as they seemed. Maybe there was more to the war against the alien threat.<br /><br />This is, in my opinion, the best book Orson Scott Card has written. The follow up books Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide were decent. I am seeing quite a few negative reviews against this book because of who the author is and things he has said; although a part of the author is in every book they write, the author isn't the book. I truly liked this book and believe that it really is a great novel.<br /><br />This book is on the Green Embers' Recommended List.
B00A6F9YFQ|3.0|Not my favorite track from the beautiful 'Elisyum'. I'm a huge PSB fan, but this just struck me as a bit drab and lazy. However, this is worth the purchase for the great B-Sides, especially 'Listening' written for and recorded by Morten Harket (his version is great too).
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|To be honest, I'm only writing this to take advantage of the author's refund offer. I have no particular desire to either encourage or discourage anyone reading this book. I read it because I like what he's written in the past about home ownership. This book contains some interesting ideas and is entertainingly written. Altucher is an interesting guy, he's lived through some interesting times, and he writes about them well and honestly. A lot of his advice is pretty down-to-earth: eat healthily, exercise, keep a positive outlook, etc. but is couched enough in the language of new-agey spiritual woo-woo to set off my BS alarm. I do like the idea of exercising one's idea muscle by coming up with ten or more new, though not necessarily good, ideas every day. His explanation of self-publishing is also good, though he leaves out the part where you need some talent to write a good book in the first place.<br /><br />I'm also somewhat put off by his glib hand-waving at the destruction of the American middle class, but I don't want this review to become a political screed.<br /><br />Finally, everytime I see the phrase \\"choose yourself\\", I can't help but think of the \\"choose life\\" speech that opens the movie Trainspotting.

B000002TLX|5.0|I bought this cd as a Christmas gift for my wife. She totally surprised that I was able to find it. We are well pleased.
B002TIWQNK|4.0|Viva La Vida - A great cover, even if it sometimes sounds like it's being played on cheap Casio keyboards (they made the same mistake with the original 'All Over the World). Love the drums at the beginning and the partial mash-up with Domino Dancing. It really works.<br /><br />It Doesn't Often Snow at Christmas - Cheesy nonsense and by that I mean really fun, happy, GOOD cheesy nonsense. It's very infectious and this new version is great.<br /><br />All Over The World - A step up from the great album version, this is just such a good PSB track. Sampling from Tchaikovsky or some other composer I can't remember, this has a full orchestra and lots of little extra flourishes, coupled with Neil's great vocal. A standout PSB track.<br /><br />My Girl - Surprisingly sinister sounding version of the old Madness hit though it does lighten up a bit for the chorus. Very listenable though not the best PSB track ever.<br /><br />My Girl (Our House Remix) - Meh :-)
0425188809|4.0|I recently reread this old favorite of mine as an unabridged audiobook. It was one of my childhood favorites so I was almost afraid to touch it and ruin the mystique I'd built up around it. Surprisingly enough, I managed to enjoy most of it despite the fact that I've become much pickier and crabbier about my reading choices as I've, eh, matured.<br /><br />This is Koontz's famous tale about genetically engineered animals which is probably much more probable and frightening now than it was in 1987! Political bigwigs have managed to fund and create \\"The Outsider\\", an intelligent killer who lives for the thrill of the kill. They've also created a golden retriever with the intelligence of a bright human (I state this because many dogs I know are smarter than many humans I've come across). The government intends to use the dogs as spies to learn about the ever elusive \\"enemy\\". After all, who would ever suspect a goofy retriever of spy tactics? These two genetically altered creatures are so smart they outsmart the scientists and escape the lab. The \\"Outsider\\" goes on a killing spree while the retriever finds a loving home with a kind man who names him \\"Einstein\\". For some inexplicable reason, \\"The Outsider\\" hates Einstein. Hates him with an undying passion and wants him dead (jealous of his doggy beauty, perhaps?). Because the two are psychically linked, it spends its time tracking down the dog when not decapitating innocent people and animals, that is.<br /><br />The remainder of the book is filled with the antics of a crazed killer-for-hire, corrupt political goings-on, \\"The Outsider's\\" quest for death and destruction and the gooey-sweet love story between Travis, a victimized woman who is so naive as to be completely unbelievable and whose name I've already forgotten and Einstein the dog. This is the kind of love triangle I enjoy, haha.<br /><br />I still loved Einstein this time around but spent a large majority of the book annoyed at the woman character who was all helpless, pathetic and needed rescuing. She was 30, THIRTY folks, and so sheltered and beaten down by a crazy old aunt that she had absolutely zero life experience and was completely missing a backbone. I don't remember noticing those things when I was a teenager or maybe I just accepted them as normal because I didn't know any better at the time. If that's the case, maybe getting older isn't such a bad thing ;)<br /><br />I enjoyed the re-read and recommend this book to any dog lover and Koontz fan. It's still one of his best but not quite the five star read I remember.elpless, pathetic and needed rescuing.

B008FC4WA4|4.0|Bastard is the type of title that readers often expect to be ironic. Everyone thinks this guy's a bastard, but deep down he's really a great guy. You only need to get to know him. But with Hornby, the reader should never expect his male protagonists to be anything other than flawed. This guy is a bastard, sad and deeply flawed. And real and funny.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|I wanted to love this so badly.  Snyder, Nolan, Cavill, Crowe, Shannon...Failure seemed nearly impossible. I must confess to being let-down. I am not a huge Superman fan. I did enjoy the Christoper Reeve versions but that's about it. I'm a Batman fan. But when I heard this was coming out, for some reason I was giddy with excitement. While others were in shock that a British man would be playing Superman, I was excited. I had just finished watching The Tudors when the announcement was made(Cavill is fantastic in it!) and I was surprised, and excited. Henry Cavill is a great actor. Subtle, but commanding. I did not mind his Superman. In fact, his brooding nature was a positive in my mind. I wanted a more serious version of Superman than the ones previously made. Cavill is not at fault here.<br /><br />The main problem with Man of Steel is it just feels discombobulated. The pacing felt off and the flashbacks, which I assume were supposed to help form a backstory, just felt out of place. They took you away from the drama and distorted the focus of the film. It's nice to see how Clark established himself as a human, always trying to fit in. His life was clearly not an easy one, but he was certainly loved by his adoptive parents ( Diane Lane and Kevin Costner). It's not that I minded the flashbacks aspect of it, I just didn't quite like the way they were handled.<br /><br />Amy Adams is adorable. But she isn't Louis Lane. She isn't even pretending to be a reporter. She offered nothing to this tale, not even romantic attachement. Her 'relationship' with Clark felt forced and just odd. She might as well have been eliminated from the film alltogether.<br /><br />Michael Shannon as Zod did OK with what he had, although it was a bit over the top at points. His climactic fight scene with Superman was borderline comical since they managed to destroy 90% of Metropolis within minutes. His backstory isn't very interesting either.<br /><br />There are quite a few things going for Man of Steel-Visual effects, musical score, his costume(which I really liked), and of course Superman himself. But the rest has to be factored in as well. I was not blown away, but it certainly is a valiant effort.

B003BWERF8|1.0|I've purchased two of the KOKKIA i10s'. The first didn't work at all and was returned to KOKKIA for them to check it out. After receiving the product they refunded my money. A couple of months later I gave it a second chance. I was able to get the second one to sync up my Ipod Classic and Jaybird JF3 headsets after many attempts. However, it only held the sync for a short while before it stopped working. The KOKKIA i10s is a waste of money.

B00009P1O5|5.0|Neil!<br />No one has ever matched Neil for breadth of experimentation, and no one has ever matched Neil for finesse of technique in the application of the hollow-body electric guitar to rock.  Sure, Jorma's Volunteers-era work with the Gibson ES was full-bodied, fuzzy, sweet, and psychedelic... but Neil?<br />Ever see a dog tilt his head to the side for a Sound?<br />You might be tempted to tip yours a bit searching for a sweeter sweet spot when Neil builds up to, and then hits that certain timbre that seems to unlock all your psychic juices... and I'll bet those notes do the same for Neil too when he's playing them.<br />Except you can't just expect him to slip right into it... you have to wait for things to build.<br />And Neil doesn't achieve such heights on all his albums, mind you.<br />But... when he does... OH!... when he does!<br />Everything opens up.<br />Your heart, your mind, and the vistas on the horizon in your mind's eye.<br />It's the overtones you see...<br />only achievable on a hollow-body, and, apparently, only by Neil, to date.  I've never heard another guitarist achieve it.<br />Neil's firm grounding in folk and Americana (in Canadiana I dare say) doesn't hurt:<br />it's like The Sound of those Great Vistas opening up before you.<br />You'll know it when you hear it, but listen to &#34;The Emperor of Wyoming&#34; on his first album, the guitar break on &#34;The Losing End&#34; on his second, and on this one... listen to the jam in the middle of &#34;Motor City&#34;.  He builds, he builds... he breaks through... he breaks out... and there it is!<br />Suddenly you notice that your head is tilting ever-so-slightly to one side.<br />And your heart is fluttering.  A funny warm feeling at the core and a fullness.  It's a gift.<br />QUITE A GIFT.<br />The man is an artist.<br />Neil!

B004UXUX7S|2.0|My wife's family is from Hawaii.  She is a descendant of Hawaiian royalty.  Her family is very much like the main character in this movie.  However, that did not sway our opinion of this film at all.  In fact, I think the only redeeming quality about this film is that it did get most of the Hawaiian heritage and feeling correct.  We recognized the feeling inside the homes, the blankets, the 'Outrigger' Club..(although they show them at what is supposed to be inside the club... it wasn't).  My wife is from a family that looks Howlie (sorry if I spelled that wrong...). Her great x3 Uncle is credited for bringing surfing back in the beginning of the 20th century.  They are very much part of the Hawaiian state.  She knows the exact feeling that this film tries to communicate... That living in Hawaii as part of it's heritage doesn't mean your life is perfect.  All that part is great...  The bad part is that the story is just horrible.  After the first 30 minutes I began to realize that the movie is never going to take off... It just goes on and on and on about his wife in a coma... Does she come out of it?  Does she die?  I don't want to give that away... Let's just say that it goes on and on and one and on and on... and then... nothing... When the credits rolled at the end... My wife said, &#34;is it over?&#34;  I was blown away.  We understood the message and we noticed the blanket at the end was the same one as... (don't want to give that away either)... I am trying to say, we understood everything... We go it... It just wasn't a good plot or story.  The acting is really great.  The stars are top notch... Just a terrible script.  What a shame.  I gave the extra star for portraying the heritage pretty accurately for a lot of Hawaiian families.  They don't all look like hoola dancers or Asian people.  Oh well...

B002QBS9KE|5.0|After utilizing the ear piece on my Plantronics Voyager Pro to point where the soft rubber piece fell off I was in desperate need to replace it. Without it the earpiece did not have much value. When I received the replacement pack of 3 it was easy to pop off the old base and pop on a new piece. Now back in business in a minute. I would definitely recommend anyone that uses their headset a lot to have spare earpiece available in case a quick replacement needs to be done.
0786958731|5.0|We've been looking for board games to play outside of the old standards like Monopoly and the like.  I have always wanted to try a tabletop RPG but my group of friends aren't on the same level of nerdery that I am.<br /><br />This game is a great alternative and can be played solo or with other people.  (I.e. drag you unwitting girlfriend or wife into the mix). From what I've read is that this game is a pretty decent board game interpretation of DnD 4th edition rules.  The rule book is a little vague however there are several YouTube videos of people playing this game that lends itself to insturcting the viewers to the finer points of the game.  There is also a scenario book to set up adventures and quests to undertake in the game<br /><br />The game itself is quite something to behold.  Numerous tiles make up the &#34;board&#34; that is used as the dungeon layout.  There many miniatures that are representative of your heroes and foes to be encountered and slain along the way.  Additionally, there are cards and tokens that allow certain gameplay actions and represent HP and other statistical or tracking related items.<br /><br />Recommended; very fun game!

B000ICLRIE|1.0|In this movie, blu ray image and sound are not a real improvement over the Special Edition DTS sound DVD edition. Plus, no extras, no introduction by Ridley Scott, no musical intermission. I`ll stick to my DVD box set and give this blu ray away.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|The most recent update to The Weather Channel app for android has taken my go-to weather app away from me.  I have used TWC app since I got my 1st gen Kindle, then on to my Kindle HD.  Then a few days ago I open the app and I get this full page screen with a blooming cherry tree branch in the background, and the current weather stats in the upper left corner, some of the lighter text washed out by the light background.  Difficult to read.  And no way to remove this distracting background.  At least give us the option to set the background to a single color.<br /><br />This was not designed for a tablet, despite what the app store info says.  And they took what was a very straight-forward, no-nonsense, clean layout and added clutter and confusion.  Seriously; who was really complaining about the last release version's layout? The clean layout and information presentation is what made TWC app so popular.<br /><br />This drive by software groups to change the UI for the sake of change is ridiculous. The reason the TWC app was so popular is because it gave us the info we wanted, clearly and simply, without clutter, without adds. As a previous reviewer stated, adds may be necessary, but they don't have to be a poorly implemented as was done in this newer version of the app.<br /><br />I am willing to pay for this app to restore to the previous version of TWC. Please consider making it an option to revert to the prior version.  Or does anyone out on the net have an image of the prior version, and a way to prevent it from updating?  If yes, please tell me how!!<br /><br />I work in the high-tech industry, with test & measurement products that rely on clear UI design to help users take critical measurements.  If I was working for TWC on this app, I'd be ashamed of what we released to the public.  As it is, I'm ashamed to have this new version of a once-great app on my Kindle Fires, and will remove it from my library as soon as I find another app that doesn't look like it was designed by a five-year-old Windows 8 fanboy who has really bad layout and color tastes.<br /><br />I'd give this 0 stars, but the system wont allow that. At least 1 star is labeled as \\"I hate it;\\" a very accurate rating from my perspective.<br /><br />If you'd left TWC app the way it was, you'd still be at the top. As it is, you are plummeting in popularity because of a poor decision to implement a poor UI.  If you want to show us how great you are, restore the previous version.<br /><br />De-Weathered in Portland.

It was a beautiful story though and resonated with my own need to answer the call of the Colorado wild where I live.

I'm a little bummed out since IOS support is coming soon but if it works at least half as good as it does on my Nexus 7 I will be satisfied.

0307730700|5.0|coverThere was only one word to describe Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown: Fearless.  Written by Eric Blehm, this is the true story of a man's journey from the dark alleys of drugs to the final alley that would end his life.  Through every trial, every situation, every moment, Adam faced his life without fear and with a fierce determination that would keep him going.<br /><br />From the beginning of the story I was pulled into the life of Adam Brown.  When he began to spiral into the world of drugs, I was heartbroken; for him and his parents.  This part of the story gave an insight into the world of drugs from the perspective of Adam and his family.  The lies. The deception.  The enabling. Bargaining.<br /><br />Miraculously, Adam and Jesus crossed paths and into his life came Kelley, an angel who became his champion, his best friend, his wife and mother of his children.  She shows such courage and strength as she helps Adam to resist the voice of crack cocaine.  When she talks about the deployments...Ya, I just couldn't imagine.  It gave me a new appreciation for the wives of our military members.<br /><br />The last part of the story when Adam becomes a Navy SEAL Team member were the toughest part of this book.  For one, I've not been a fan of the wars we have found ourselves in.  Adam's story brings a COMPLETELY different light to this debate.  I found myself uncomfortable as I read about the SEAL's commitment and dedication to their jobs; after all, I can have my opinion about it ... but this is their job, their reality.<br /><br />The ending is heartbreaking; truly heartbreaking.  But it's worth reading.  Inspirational.  Woven throughout is a thread of faith, forgiveness and unconditional love.<br /><br />I was provided a copy of this book for review.  All opinions are my own.

B00C1BHQXK|5.0|In a world of \\"multi-tasking\\"- The One thing challenges this notion.  Keller goes even as bold to say that (honestly) things in life are going to suffer if you are going to succeed at a level many of us want. This makes so much sense it's ridiculous.  I had so many moments of enlightenment as I read through this book.  Concepts such as having enough discipline to build a habit, rather than feeling the pressure to live fully disciplined fit well into my life as a busy professional with hopes of growing beyond the ordinary and seeking excellence.  Living with purpose, avoiding traps and distraction, and defining what our life (as we want it to be) should look like fired me up to focus and drive harder in the right places in my life.  This is a real instruction manual and not just theory.  Read it, but a copy for your team, and discuss it's content.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I'd give this app a higher rating except for one thing: sometimes if an mp3 download gets interrupted,  when I resume the download it saves...well, I don't know where! It saves as an mp3, but doesn't go to my music player so I download the song again. Basically I end up with two copies of the same thing, except one copy is MIA.

B00AAAKH80|5.0|This album is just great! I listen to it non stop in the car. It has upbeat songs and some slower ones but it is put together so well that I never want to skip a song. If you like any of the songs they already released then you will love this entire album!!! I would recommend everyone buys this!!! And the digital booklet is awesome! It has the songs listed and the lyrics for them all. I love it when they include the lyrics for their songs so I don't have to look on google for what someone thinks they are saying. So I will end with...I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS ALBUM AND FLORIDA GEORGIA LINE!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I can't praise this show enough - amazing, fantastic, so well acted - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  The historical accuracy has been touched up for character/plot/show entertainment, but is still good, and the setting/materials/props accuracy is amazing.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|and that is saying something, because I have loved all of his work. This is right up there with The Stand, one of my all time favorite books of any writer. The premise is very clever and it caught me right away. The characters are well drawn and interesting and the dialog is natural. I am only a quarter of the way through the book and hate to put it down ...one does have to eat and sleep and work....<br />You don't have to be a Stephen King fan to enjoy this book and if you are a fan? well...add this one to your favorite list.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Humans are human!  Our family connections and loyalties are inborn and we can relate when the human stories are  shared.  Hard choices make  for agonizing decisions that reverberate through the years, which in this case results in<br />a powerful story.  It helps to put our lives in perspective.
B00BVYJG18|3.0|KSE, despite another change in singers, has managed to put out a solid album.  It's not amazing, not groundbreaking, but it's good!  There are several songs in the middle that are less than thrilling, but also several that are quite fun.

B0083Z614S|4.0|This is an oldie but goodie. Usually considered a children's story, it has some good lessons for everybody. I found the characters charming. Gardeners would find it accurately portrays gardening. Parents would find it a stretch to think children could spend all day with no adult supervision. It reads easily and smoothly.
B006M4RN3U|1.0|Apart from the arty cover and font, this album resembles nothing close to what I've come to love about underground and indie music. Make no mistake, this is mainstream pop that tries to pull off a faux-free spirit nature of experiemntal artists who actually take chances. This isn't challenging or edgy whatsoever. It's very tame and sounds like some marketing execs came together to help form this album because Indie is trending right now. These guys are to indie as what Vanilla Ice is to Hip Hop. Fake and fabricated.
B000T45C6E|4.0|One of Will Smith's most memorable performance!  This has got to be one of my favorite movies. Beautifully performed. One of those films that can easily be called a classic.

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|A very good read. The authors have woven a very interesting tale of how IT has become central to any company's success and how DevOps will play a  critical role in taking that to the next level. Loved the way they have incorporated corporate politics into the book - very realistic.

B003UYUP58|4.0|Fascinating book from start to finish. COMING from someone with no background in medicine or science, I learned a lot from this book. The author is a fantastic storyteller, and uses language that's easy for the casual reader to understand. The journey of cancer is remarkable, in that in some cases if you got cancer 2500 years ago, the mortality rates are the same, yet other forms of cancer, cancer is now preventable. Until recently, doctors hadn't realized that cancer lives in all of us essentially. It's scary to think about really. But it will affect us all someday, in some shape or form, so I encourage you to read this book.

However, this is the best book I've ever read. It made my wife and I laugh, smile, and appreciate everything that is good and pure in this life. I am planning on buying it for my friends and family as well and I hope you all get the same enjoyment from it as we have. I am just hoping/waiting for a sequel!

B000QUCNOK|5.0|I watched PERFUME in class and absolutely fell in love with it then I tried looking for it, but failed to find it anywhere (I live in the U.S, in California) shipping was fast and the DVD was in superb condition; no scratches, no skipping- only some slight cosmetic damage on the case itself but nothing to whine about. I am extremely happy with my purchase and will definitely be a repeat customer :-)
1451638450|4.0|Not as much fun as Miles, but interesting none the less.  It was great reading about Ivan, who is finally showing that hew is almost as intelligent as Miles.<br />Sometimes the &#34;town clown aspect of Ivan overshadow his truly remarkable ability to put small things together and draw remarkable conclusions.  I've really loved everything Lois has written and hacve tyhem all and since I am a re-reader, I get to enjoy them over and over.

B000JMKRKC|5.0|Beautifully written and artfully crafted. I had a hard time putting this book down!  I can't wait to read more from this author.
0385347774|5.0|By far the best book I have read this year. Flynn takes you on an emotional roller coaster with each of the characters and she keeps you guess who defines as a protagonist. A storyline unlike any other that I have recently read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|4th time reading and it still feels like the first. Hurts just as much every time, but I find my self smiling more and more with each read. A book that can not be matched at least not in my infinity. If you have not read this wonderfully beautiful story about truly living your best life and understanding that weakness is ok and that those moments will make you a stronger person in the end then you need to, life changing.
1594746168|5.0|The Resurrectionist combines art and words to flesh out a chilling narrative, and to great effect. Without the meticulous anatomical drawings, the story would feel almost, but not quite slight. Without the story, the pictures would be interesting, but incomplete, curiosities lost without context. Together, these elements plunge the reader into a frightening, twining arc--one of brothers and rivals and triumph and disgrace and ultimately...darkness. The ending is solid enough to let the reader draw the right conclusions, but it's also drawn with the shade of ambiguity. Unanswered questions are left to fester and we wonder...what exactly has Dr. Black wrought and who will be left standing to pay for it?
B004HWYTP4|4.0|this movie was full of action, great cast, very funny. I couldn't wait to watch the RED 2, and the second is better than the first

1476733953|2.0|I am conflicted as to how to rate this book - maybe a 2.5?  Howey has a very good sense of how people behave and speak. His characters possess individual identity. This was immediately evident and was what I enjoyed most.<br /><br />However, I had the feeling while reading Wool that Howey was exploiting his ability (and me) to write a lot in a short amount of time.  It was also clear that Howey has his eye on capitalizing on the future movie, which is pretty much a certainty. The book should be easily adaptable to the movie format.  The plot is simple enough and the characters stereotyped.  Not much effort will be required by either the script writer or the movie goers.<br /><br />To make a long story short, Howey seems to first visualize his story (as if he were watching a movie or maybe a TV mini series) and then describe it in rank detail. The book sorely needs an editor.  I am a bit exhausted after reading it and must confess that I have little desire to read even more.  I can pretty much guess what will follow.  I think I will wait for the movie trilogy (I'm sure the producers will find the same opportunity to exploit our pockets as Howey has) and watch them in fast forward mode from Netflix.<br /><br />I can't help but be suspicious of the many ways the book has been partitioned to maximize the marketing effect.  Based upon Howey's release dates for the serial format, it's hard to believe that this wasn't contrived.  Where is the art in that?

B000FC0V3E|4.0|It seemed to me to be a rather classic tale of something that seemed like a great idea when everyone was completely drunk, and then didn't play out so well.  I enjoyed the sections of the book that focused more on the travel, and the fishing.  The bull fight was exciting, but really not my cup of tea.  The subtle difference between appreciating something and enjoying something.  Times have changed, that is obvious in this story.  Views on race, alcohol, and relationships being just a few.  I am glad I took the chance to read it.

I really feel as though this shouldn't have been an accessory to the camera being that there is no way to determine what your shooting pictures or video of with just the camera itself. The shipping was reasonable and it got here a little later than expected but not bad. The images on the lcd screen  are of good quality and like I said now you can actually see what your shooting with the camera. It would be nice to have a bigger screen maybe all the way to the edges of the device as you can see in the picture. Other than that it is a must to have this for the go pro camera! I will come back after the trip and weigh in on it!

034580709X|4.0|Taken on a stand-alone basis, this is a serviceable mystery that doesn't really kick into full gear until about halfway through the novel and still leaves the reader in the position of having to make a few too many big leaps. (For instance, I found the premise that the young Norwegian, Ingrid Holtzer, was significant enough for the Oslo police department to send Harry Hole halfway around the world to help with the investigation, a little implausible. He brought nothing to the table, and even in the early days of the Internet when this was first written, communication was efficient enough to not have to have someone peering over the shoulders of the local cops.)<br /><br />But then, this isn't the typical stand-alone mystery, or even a typical series debut. Rather, it's the first in a successful series of mysteries featuring Harry Hole, and most of its likely readers have probably already been wondering about the cryptic references in [[ASIN:0062068423 The Redbreast: A Harry Hole Novel]] to certain traumatic events that took place in Sydney. It's always annoying when you realize that you're jumping into a mystery series midway through, and this means that newcomers to Harry's investigative misadventures can turn rapidly to [[ASIN:034580709X The Bat: The First Inspector Harry Hole Novel (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard Original)]] to fill in the gaps.<br /><br />I still wouldn't recommend starting the series with this book, however. Yes, there's a lot to be said for reading a mystery series in order, but while it has its interesting and even fascinating aspects -- notably, the character of Andrew Kensington, the Aboriginal detective with whom Harry works on his arrival in Sydney, and the stories that Andrew tells him of Aboriginal legends and the country's history -- it isn't the strongest debut. But many of the side characters are two-dimensional and crucial epiphanies on Harry's part (particularly with respect to Andrew) aren't really as convincing as they could or should be, even as Harry's decision to put another character in jeopardy struck me as more of a plot device than anything else.<br /><br />So -- if you're new to Harry Hole and Jo Nesbo's books, put this one aside for now, and start with [[ASIN:0062068423 The Redbreast: A Harry Hole Novel]]. If you're puzzled, or hungry for more, come back to this to fill in the gaps, and then carry on. I don't think there are enough spoilers in the later book to make it unlikely you'll want to read this debut, if that is something you might be worrying about.<br /><br />An adequate and at times downright promising debut; had I read it first, however, I may have been less eager to read the later and better books in the series.d be, even as Harry's decision to put another character in jeopardy struck me as more of a plot device than anything else.<br /><br />So -- if you're new to Harry Hole and Jo Nesbo's books, put this one aside for now, and start with [[ASIN:0062068423 The Redbreast: A Harry Hole Novel]].

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love this book, i believe it displays not only the various trouble that we as the human race would experience, but the most terrible and the most resilient of our species. Be it the horrible government(s), big companies or individuals or the single folks who exceed expectations and truly show there good nature during the struggle. As a member of the military who has seen combat multiple times in Iraq i don't doubt for one minute this is the way the government would react, and just how unprepared they would be. I loved this book and i hope all of you do as well.

B00CWVF2GC|4.0|I must say that I find the foreign genre to be much better than American versions.  This film was thoughtful and well done.  As a sequel, I thought it held its' own against the original and was pleased to see the character development in the 10 year \\"gap\\" between movies.  The lead actor is just adorable too and is a very talented actor.  He nails the role perfectly.  Very well done!

B0090SI582|5.0|WOW!<br /><br />There's a great sense of the epic in the story and at the same time there is an intimacy about his personal journey to rediscover himself!<br /><br />It's a drama, a sci-fiction delight, and an action movie! It's romantic (A man's journey especially when seeking something about himself is always romantic, Japan as the backdrop adds to the mystery and enigma, and the relationships of Logan with women of different backgrounds and personal qualities are part of the story's emotional appeal), it's intriguing ( when getting deeper into the story and alien culture), and it's visually breathtaking and the heart throbs at the sounds of the battles!<br /><br />I like fast-paced movies, with great story-telling, and fascinating characters -- and this movie suits the bill! I never disliked Origins (as some fans do) and had that been better edited and not focused on the mutant rainfall at the end, I was reminded of that movie with THE WOLVERINE, in the tone and romantic appeal of discovering a hero who is  not of the same template as other screen heroes.<br /><br />Mangold and his creative team have delivered! Hugh, as always, marshalls his dramatic, romantic, and manly appeal to further enhance the Wolverine persona and admirable qualities! I wish the Oscars nominating committee would seriously consider roles of this nature when they look at the year's best!<br /><br />An excellent movie of its genre... although it also represents great screen drama, with a sensitive character portrayal which sets it apart from other action heroes screen stereoptypes!

B004J4WKUQ|4.0|REVIEW BY 14 OLD READER. Ready Player One is about a time when virtual reality is invented as a game, called OASIS. It later turns into a daily program people use for work, school, gaming, and living their lives. When the creator of OASIS dies, a will is left for the world. The will is a scavenger hunt to finding a hidden \\"egg\\" in the program, in which the winner will become powerful and wealthy. When Wade Watts attempts to locate the \\"egg,\\" he comes across many others who are trying to find the egg also. Some are considered friends. The others being the IOI, a powerful corporation cheating there way into getting the egg by using their employees, money, bribe, and threats.<br /><br />Ready Player One is a great book. It captures the true golden age of video-gaming. It mentions many old video games for such systems as the Atari 2600 and the Commodore 64. In addition, many '80s movie references are made in the book. The characters are well portrayed and the story is very creative. The story gets a bit slow near the end but picks up a few pages before the end. One other thing is that the text size of the paperback edition is smaller than the size of most books, so for some readers it may be more difficult to read the small print. I'd recommend this book to those who enjoy old video games and movies, virtual reality, and quests to find a valuable item. The recommended age would be 13 and up.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|I started watching this series knowing nothing about and ended up wanting more. Its a bit cheesy at times but has a depth to it rare for modern tv programming (Not counting premium channels of course). 1 season was most definitely way to short for this show.

0385347774|2.0|After a promising and whip smart first half, the second half was boring and the lazy ending ruined it.  It's like there were two writers writing this novel.  The concept was really interesting, so I'm hoping the script writers will take some creative license with the second half of the story.  Maybe at least the movie goers will be satisfied!

This story is about a woman who was abused by her father first than her husband, all the while she was hiding the truth from her loving brother.<br />The story starts out with Meagan on her way to her brother's funeral in a town she has never been to but a town where she is about to get a whole lotta love. Now enter in Todd ( who doesn't love a good looking guy with great eyes LOL)<br />I can not express how sweet this was, I loved it.<br />Only thing is the ended was a bit rushed (I felt) but it was still really good.

B0064X7FVE|2.0|Used to be a good app too much clutter.  Can't find anything among the ads, the cluttering pictures, and the junk.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Another reviewer said The Winery Dogs debut might be the best rock album of the past 20 years (more or less). Now having listened to the whole album all the way through, I might have to agree with that! yes, it's that good.<br /><br />For fans of Richie Kotzen's songwriting, vocals and guitar playing, this is the album that I think many of us have been waiting to hear his amazing talents put towards. With the fab rhythm section of legends-in-their-own-right Portnoy and Sheehan, this is the MOST polished, cohesive and downright rockin' and rollin' album I've ever heard Kotzen on.<br /><br />Kotzen's vocals on this record are in one word - amazing. On so many tracks, his vocals are absolutely soaring! If there ever was any doubt about his vocal abilities (his guitar playing has probably always overshadowed his vocals), this album will surely put to rest any thoughts that Kotzen is \\"just\\" a shredding guitar player who also sings. Yes, music is absolutely NOT a competition, but on this record, Kotzen's vocals could easily stand toe to toe with top rock vocalists such as Chris Cornell. This is the absolute best I've ever heard Kotzen sing. And for guitar fans, fear not, perhaps driven extra by virtuosos Portnoy and Sheehan, Richie's playing is in superb shape as well - most varied, exciting, hard hittin' and at the same time lyrical that I've heard from him in years.<br /><br />A bit of background: I've followed Richie Kotzen's solo career since his first all instrumental album in the late 80s right through to his most recent studio album the excellent \\"24 Hours\\", and while it's always been clear that Kotzen can sing, there've always been moments here and there, or tunes here and there on his solo albums where I've felt there was something a little missing from his vocal delivery to match up to everything else he brings to the table (guitar playing, song writing, producing, etc). NOT so on The Winery Dogs. Nothing is lacking from his vocals here - maybe it's just taken these past 20+ years for Kotzen to hone his voice to this point, but whatever it is, I'm so glad that on The Winery Dogs, he's really been able to show the world what his voice is capable of. It's really the total package now - power, control, range, clarity, dynamics, soul, great tone, the whole nine.<br /><br />Moving on to the excellent song writing - These songs are NOT just vehicles for 3 instrumental virtuosos to showoff their chops, even though it's so obvious right from the first bar of every song that this is a band with legends of the art behind it. Every song is a strong tune in it's own right, nevermind the fact that we are blessed to have 3 masters at their respective instruments (4 actually counting Kotzen's voice as well) groovin' together to take it all to dizzying heights. Songs like \\"I'm no angel\\", \\"You saved me\\" and \\"Regret\\" show how these guys can easily switch gears from Zeppelin-ish hard hitting slammin' to more laid back, soulful tunes so naturally and without it sounding contrived.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, get this album! If these guys come to your city, go watch them, this is a band to support. We need more honest, hard hitting music makers like these guys to keep going and keep putting out records for many years to come.

I read it in one sitting, then went back and read it again because I consider myself an avid reader and intelligent but I just DID NOT GET IT.<br /><br />That being said, it was interesting, I finished it twice after all.  Perhaps I was trying too hard to find the magic other reviewers talk about?  Who doesn't like a bit of magic and a great feeling after they read a terrific book?  I wish I could say I felt the same.<br /><br />The prose is outstanding.  I love the way Mr. Gaiman delivers his words.<br /><br />\\"The Graveyard Book\\" remains my favorite.
B003YVLC18|5.0|Updated version of an old classic fairy tale.  Feel good movie, great moral story.  Drew Barrymore always does a great acting job.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|A great book that entertains. Two of the greatest writers of the last 20-30 years collaborate on a book about the end days. What could be funnier than that?
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Jude Law puts up a good performance as the put-upon psychiatrist who's caught up in a game of fraud, but the whole movie feels a little bit flat. It kept me entertained through the end, but it was hard to really care about any of the characters. Rooney was more likable when she was pretending to be a depressed woman who &#34;accidentally&#34; killed her husband. Catherine Zeta-Jones was sufficiently creepy (and still beautiful!). Overall a pretty decent movie to watch on a rainy day if you're bored.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman's living up to my expectations. He weaves another great story that hooks you from the beginning. Defeinitely worth the read.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I am using two Cooler Master Sickleflow fans on this heatsink to cool an i5-3570K overclocked to 4.6GHz. My idle temps are about what the stock cooler was, perhaps a degree cooler, but that isn't what I bout this tower to cool for. At 100% load in Prime95 with the large in place FFTs, it cools almost as well as a 240mm water cooling radiator.<br /><br />The heatsink itself feels heavy (not too heavy) and solid, though when you look at it you can see why it only costs ~$28. It has small gaps on the heatplate where the copper connects and the fins bend /Very/ easily. Cooler Master also assumes that you don't plan to replace the Blademaster fan that it comes with, as the package only includes one set of foam pads for the other fan holder. I had to peel off the current ones, then re-apply them. When I upgrade to two corsair SP120 PWM fans, I may have to go buy the foam from a store.<br /><br />It installed quite easily, the biggest problem I had was on screw wouldn't agree with the backplate and I had to work at it for a bit longer than I expected. The thermal paste provided seems like far too much (which is actually a good thing), and it seems like decent stuff. Mounting went easily, once I thought to remove the fans because I couldn't screw it down with them on. Even with the fans on though, it doesn't block any of the RAM lanes on my GA-Z77X-UD3H motherboard, if you are willing to see your RAM touching it. (I use Corsair Vengeance currently). Once attached, it doesn't move from side to side, but you can spin it slightly, which seems a bit odd with so much force pressing down on it.<br /><br />Overall, this is probably the cooler I will get again, if I don't feel like spending the extra $5 for the Hyper 212 Evo version, and I will certainly not get water cooling for far more than this, or even a Noctua heatsink unless I feel like breaking world records. Putting on a pair of Corsair fans (they have the most accurate real life specifications) is probably a good idea, but I'm sure that this would cool amazingly with even a pair of crappy fans.<br /><br />Even with it's few (very few for the price) shortcomings, this is the best price to performance cooler you can possibly buy as of the current market. Definitely worth getting.<br /><br />Corsair 300R<br />GA-Z77X-UD3H<br />i5-3570K @ 4.6GHz<br />Hyper 212+ w/CM Sickleflow fans
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Very good book with an interesting plot that keeps you glued to the page. If you like Gaiman or A Lee Martinez then you'll enjoy this book.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I was a bit hesitant to start into this book, having read many reviewers stating how much different this book is from Ender's Game.  It's true, Speaker is its own beast; a distinctly different tone, setting, pace and plot, but it has the same basic premise and spirit. The significant difference, in my mind, is the level of maturity. Whereas Ender's Game was fast paced, and written in a manner that anyone of practically any age can enjoy, Speaker is geared more towards a mature reader, and is written with greater emotional and philosophical depth.<br /><br />On its own, Speaker could have been a great novel, but I think Card's decision to write Ender as a full novel gives Speaker even more depth and meaning. If the only thing you really enjoyed from Ender was the battles, then there's not much need to read this book - give yourself a few years, reread Ender, and give yourself a chance to appreciate the human interactions of Ender, because to me that was the greatest strength of Ender as well as Speaker. Once you fully appreciate Ender, there's no way you won't appreciate and love this novel as well.<br /><br />Speaker is a great story, with fantastic characters that jumped off the page for me, and it was highly satisfying to see Ender as a man. However, I did feel that the novel gave short shrift to its early characters and that some of the philosophy that is delved into in the next book, Xenocide, could have been brought forward and fleshed out here. I think that perhaps an additional 50-100 pages would have been sufficient to bring more life and meaning to the characters before Ender arrives.<br /><br />Despite this, Speaker is one of the best novels that I've ever read. It is masterfully written, and conceived. I'm sure that even though this book does give a feeling of completion in term of plot resolution at the end, you will want more, and the next two novels in the series will be a necessary read for everyone.
140006922X|4.0|A disclaimer: I'm an atheist, I majored in classics and I paid full price for this book at a brick & mortar. Let that say what it will about my judgment.<br /><br />Now,  if you seek confirmation that Jesus was/is the one, true Son of God, the savior of humanity, through which all can attain an everlasting life...that's not in this book. If you want a book by a Christian and for Christians, which will echo and confirm your Christian beliefs, then this is not the book for you.  Don't buy it, don't waste your time and money. There are plenty of other books out there that are just what you're searching for. I can't give you any recommendations (my apologies) but I'm sure a quick search on google or a trip to your local Christian book seller will get you started. Good luck, have a nice day.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you have an open mind and an interest in history, you probably will enjoy this book. Christian, Atheist or whatever, there is no denying the impact Jesus has had on history. There is so much we will never know - can never know - about the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth - not the Jesus you learn about at Sunday school or vacation bible study. This book is about the Nazarean, whom every Christian will tell you walked as a man among men. Reza Aslan investigates this man and the world that he was born into, his short life and his agonizing death, and tries to fill in the blanks where he can with conjecture based on scholarship.<br /><br />To the Kind Reader of this Review: If you are honestly researching this book, I would consider extremely suspect any one or two-star reviews. I don't feel one or two stars is a fair rating of what you can expect. Yet I do have my reservations about this book, though I admit I'm no biblical scholar. I appreciated the notes section, but I would have liked footnotes. I found it repetitive at times, resulting from what i would consider a somewhat unusual organization. And there were some arguments I found unclear or wanting from lack of evidence, but that is just from my first read through. That last opinion may change - one way or the other - with more thoughtful analysis on my part. With all that it mind, I think 4 stars is fair - and I sure wish I had bought it from Amazon...ting from lack of evidence, but that is just from my first read through. That last opinion may change - one way or the other - with more thoughtful analysis on my part. With all that it mind, I think 4 stars is fair - and I sure wish I had bought it from Amazon...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Don't let this game's simplicity fool you,  it will drive you crazy!  You'll want to pull out your hair and curse the locked room gods until you fumble thru the right series of events that opens the door.  Definitely worth playing.  I can't wait to pull out my remaining hair once more levels are released.
0765325950|5.0|I enjoyed readying the ending to the Wheel of Time Saga.  As with any great narrative, I wish there were more stories to follow, alas I don't see this as a possibility.  Brandon Sanderson performed admirably in the way he brought the series to a close.  Mr. Sanderson did an excellent job staying true to Robert Jordan's narrative style.  I personally would have truly enjoyed more But the story cannot last forever.  And I can see no way to remain the world of &#34;The Wheel of Time&#34; with other storylines.  It was truly sad to find myself at the end of the story.  Rand did leave a feeling of hope for the future with his quiet withdrawal from the lives of those around him.  Was it just his pipe that held some type of magic, or with all he had been through had he some new form of magic to pull from.  There are many questions left in the wake of the ending of &#34;A Memory of Light&#34;, but none that MUST be answered.  Excellent job Mr. Sanderson.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I bought this as a gift, and I am certain that it has been enjoyed since my friend is a big Susan Boyle fan.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Very conventional and predictable, but the Minions are hilarious. We went with the grandchildren and laughed a lot. The plot is tired but the Minions and their gibberish save the day. I suspect the French sense of humor made this work.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great on my kindle.  Love it. Very informative and handy while on a road trip/ovation. I use this app on a daily basis.
0446530573|5.0|I got this book for practically free (with a few bucks for shipping) from a seller off amazon.  It's basically a Sopranos-themed cookbook.  I'm not a cooking guy by any stretch of the imagination, but I found the recipes to be relatively straightforward and easy to comprehend.  I love the Sopranos show and this is just a fun little recipe book to go along with it.  Hopefully someday I'll get around to making some of these recipes.  Even if you don't ever cook anything, it's fun reading.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought this was an excellent book. I truly enjoyed the series. I did not want to put the books down.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Says it is a good book. Kindle as always is seamless and easy transactions. Oops, now I think about it, I better change Amazon Prime info cause they will try to get money that is not on that card! lol. Better change them!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is very entertaining. I play it every chance I get . More like a real horse . No doubt about it , I recommend you getting this game .

B008602KQI|5.0|Excellent movie.  Read the book and felt it stayed true.  Good special effects and great acting.  Would recommend this movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Discovered Suits on Amazon Prime. Now I seem unable to go to bed without watching at least one episode. Really like the sparky and sharp conversations and relationships. I recommend to family and friends.
B009XY97VC|4.0|The vocals arent the best and dubstep? Really? Still a really nice listen though, and fits with their other works.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George rr martin does a great job of introducing the characters and keeping the reader entertained. Such a great series can't wait for the last books to come out.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|The game itself is fun, there isn't a lot of explanation to go from. Also, you can't really make progress unless you spend money on the game, so that's a definite consideration.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This book was a bit of a let down after the 3rd book but it introduces new characters into the game.  It will be a worthwhile book once martin finishes the series and everything ties in.
B005H9B44A|4.0|This my \\"go to\\" movie when I'm undecided about what to watch. I don't understand my attraction to it but its a fun view.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|This is a middle book in the series but it is a Good book, definitely worth reading to get to the 3rd book.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Great family movie! My kids love it and watch it over and over again. Doesn't drive the adults too crazy either!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|In my opinion this is the best book of the series.  It makes you want to read the entire book in one sitting.
B002K0WBXW|1.0|I was very disappointed in the quality of the recording. The sound was weak, had to turn the volume almost all the way up, and even with that had to turn on cc to get some of the dialogue.  There were a couple places where the image fractured and the sound went away completely.  I had intended it to be a gift, glad I checked it out first. Wasn't good for anything but the trash heap.
B00009ATIX|4.0|I really give this film 3.5 stars, but I rounded up because I thought the acting was surprisingly solid.<br /><br />This movie will appeal to those sci-fi fans that aren't adrenaline junkies, and enjoy a bit of the mystical, bordering on the supernatural mixed in with this slow-simmering space station mind bender.<br /><br /> Also, this film is a unique adaptation of Lem's book and also unique from the previous Tarkovsky film version. It cuts its own path, leveraging the ideas of both, but with a focus on romance delivered with a mystical twist.<br /><br />I was a bit thrown off at the initial premise, one guy sent to rescue a space station, where I could of thought of a number of better ways to rescue it, but going with the flow of the film, it sucks you in.<br /><br />If you like high adrenaline with your Sci-fi look elsewhere, but if you like a slow burn mind bender, give this a try.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I decided to read this again since the movie will be out soon. It is hands down my fav in the series. You get so attached to new characters.
0307476073|1.0|Well, if you have never accomplished anything even remotely difficult in your entire life, you have backed down from every challenge you have ever faced and you dramatize the natural course of life (like losing your parents) then this book will &#34;inspire&#34; you.  Otherwise, it's offensive at best. Hiking a couple hundred miles of a 2,600 mile trail is not thru-hiking. This book is horrible, so horrible I burned it so no one else would have to repeat my mistake. I've never even contemplated burning a book before. Horrible...
B00CL68BK2|1.0|This movie is depressing in content and pace. The entire first hour establishes and reestablishes the main character's mental illness and obsession with his estranged wife. It was so boring I turned it off.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Safe Haven is sweet story of transforming love and learning to trust.  It does speak to the heart of domestic abuse and the ravages of addiction.  It's a great story of second chances and happily ever afters.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It was wonderful to heard the story from the American and German side both.  I hadn't heard anything from the German side before.<br />How incredible that the German pilot saved the American pilot and crew. And that they met again after the war.<br />My husband and I both enjoy this book very much.
044024613X|5.0|I could not put this one down. The psychological dynamics of this family are compelling. I was reminded of the old movie The Bad Seed. It was certainly a chilling portrayal of life gone wrong and how easily we gloss over the hard realities. It is a well crafted story that is very relevant in this day and age.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Okaty don't shoot me but I loved the host so much!<br />I like the sci fi of it and what makes it better is how realistic is it.<br />I hated how they beat her up and put her in the hole in the wall.<br />In the book the wall was so much smaller then the one inside the movie. It was so tiny the book said when she came out she was stiff. I thinks that when I loved the book because it brought out such visional importance to the work.<br />I also loved how it was a twist. I did just hear it was part one of many in the book series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Full of twists and turns. Surprise after surprise. I loved this book.  Please read this book. You won't be disappointed.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|love love love the crossfire books :)<br />can't wait for the next installment of Gideon and Ava<br />i want more
B00005YU1O|5.0|This really is a mentally stimulating film, which is why I love it so much. Great rewatch value, and interesting to see the non-animated live action segments in the extras. Some of these monologues are inspiring, some are jibberish, some are light, some are heavy... a great variety of scenes and interesting topics of discussion.
B00AAX68HG|3.0|This game is amazing other than one thing, the ads. It sorta like when you are  stuck on a level and you have to use the redo button and it doesnt have to load. Except when BAM, a wild ad appears then you have to wait an eternity until it loads again.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini always paints a pictures with his words and weaves a beautiful story, and this novel is no different.
B00701QRB8|5.0|I saw the Captain when he toured on this album in London in the 1960's. While many think he evolved from here, I believe he lost a solid rock base.  I saw his Troutmask band and preferred the solid rock of the Safe as Milk era.  The Captain was an exceptional harmonica player and was a great act.  If you have not heard Safe as Milk take a listen it was the Captain at his best.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|the book is interesting but the formatting of the font/pages is terrible! the lines are too close together and was actually giving me a headache. I tried changing the size and the font style but nothing helped. Too bad because I actually found the story line interesting. I did not finish the book.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I really don't care for the new Yahoo Mail.  The ads are in the way, It is more annoying to use and makes me wonder what else Yahoo is doing.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I like everything about this app except for 2 things. 1. It doesn't seem to link up to your actual account so only half the tweets you tweet from other platforms show up and if you change anything on your profile, even your name, it doesn't show up. 2. if someone tweets a photo, you can't see it right there in the app. It opens a new window in your browser instead.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|I've enjoyed this book - gave me insight into behaviors which I find especially helpful at work. The author explains behaviors that you intuitively read, but don't really pay attention to - now I do! I loved his anecdotes - they make you realize how important it is to really read body language. Fascinating.<br /><br />I bought the Kindle version which I think is missing some illustrations, so I would recommend buying the actual book..
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I'm in love with this game! I've beat it and started over 4 times now. The missions are fun but tough and I love saving my coins for new things in the game. Super addicting though so be forewarned.
B008JFUR10|3.0|Was looking forward to this one. But ...<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />The fights were sometimes hard to follow due to the darkness and close-up shots. Since many reviews said this was a highlight, it was disappointing. And the fights don't always make sense, contrary to reviews that said they do.<br /><br />Sure, blame the dinosaurs. We always get the blame.<br /><br />The hero is somewhat bland.<br /><br />Some of it just doesn't make sense. Why does one Jaeger have escape pods and the other not?<br /><br />The \\"scientist geek\\" characters are way too screechy and irritating. I'm not sure I could take another viewing unless I fast-forwarded all their scenes.<br /><br />The Jaegers have to be transported by helicopter? Really? Seems slower to deploy than letting them get there on their own steam.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />The kaiju are scary due to their design.<br /><br />Fun with Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Some interesting character backstory and interaction, although nothing terribly original. A couple of interesting twists regarding mind-melding with monsters.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Fun for at least one watch; not sure I'd buy it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't like how I can't choose most recent instead of top stories. I don't want to see what people posted last week, I want to see what they posted today! also, when I tap on a picture and then try to go back to my newsfeed, I have to hit the back button about 20 times before the picture will actually close. so annoying! You also can't delete stuff you post which is scary if you don't have access to a computer. otherwise the app is fine.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This was the most disappointing book out of the series. The storyline was not interesting and the writing was not great - looks like there will be another book in the series, but I think it's ending for me here.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Love this movie! Brought my emotions to the edge of my seat over and over.  And the juxtaposition of scenery and subject matter made the emotional roller coaster well worth the price o admission.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. It took a very real & dispassionate look at disability & death from the point of view of the people experiencing it. easy to read & well-written. I couldn't put it down.
B00DGKQ5I2|2.0|I have been highly anticipating this album ever since their last release and have been eager to see what direction they are heading in. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of it. They are going towards a direction of a lot less screaming and much more regular singing. This takes away the edge that they once had and makes them more of just a rock band. They kind of lose their genre of metalcore with this move, and at this point I'm not sure how long this will last. But I have a feeling that it will be permanent. Another thing I noticed was how the range between length of songs was very small. There wasn't even a minute difference between the shortest and longest song, meaning that it's harder for each individual song to stand out.<br /><br />Despite this, the opening track is still a great one, separating the singing and screaming almost completely. I almost thought that they'd go this whole song without clean vocalist Kyle Pavone singing, but then right at the end he comes in with a very memorable part that invokes pathos from its listeners. The next track, \\"Fade Away,\\" is pretty weak and generic, sounding too much like a random, generic rock song. Not a good pick for the second song on the album considering it almost sounds like filler. The third song, \\"I Survive,\\" is far too mellow to even sound like a WCAR song. In fact, it doesn't even sound like a metal song at all.<br /><br />\\"Ghosts\\" sounds a lot like a song that should appear on a WCAR album, but still seems to be missing something. It lacks the edgy heaviness that their past two albums had. Despite the great opening by David Stephens, it turns into a completely different song halfway through the song and fails to impress me much more than the other songs. I actually really like \\"Present, Future, and Past\\" mainly due to the prevalence of much more screaming than singing. I wish there were more tracks like this instead of a bunch of songs that sound like a completely different band. \\"Never Let Me Go\\" has a pretty strong chorus, but overall it's not strong enough of a song. I'd rather not head Stephens sing as well, especially when there's very little screaming in the whole song.<br /><br />The rest of the album is just average or below average, failing to provide another memorable song, or even one that I'd be interested in listening to more than once. They really seemed to miss the target with this album. I attribute this failure mainly to Pavone, who I felt like was weak with his vocals after the opening track. Stephens tried his best, but there wasn't enough screaming to make it sound like a WCAR album. I'm sorry, but this album just didn't do it for me. I can't give it any more than a 6.5/10. I wouldn't recommend this album...save your money for Texas In July's album, which is being released the same day. I expect that to perform better. If the album was called \\"Tracing Back Roots,\\" how come it was so different from anything they've ever done? It just doesn't make sense.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|It gets off to a slow start, which is not unusual for Le Carre, but hang in there, in the end I couldn't put it down.

B008JFUNYG|5.0|To say many fall short in the remake game is a fairly obvious statement. There are, however, diamonds in the rough. This is one of them. Do yourself a favor if you're a horror movie buff that SOMEHOW hasn't heard about this movie or the ones it is based on.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I found this book when I did a search for Shelly Laurenston books. Ms. sanders books came up in the results, I thought maybe this was a pseudonym, but that does not appear to be the case. For whatever reason, it came up and I am glad that it did. This was a sweet and emotional read. I liked watching Megan become more confident and grow. I thought the issues with the abuse were handled well. Todd was supportive and was not pushy. This is the first book in a series, and u could definitely tell who is likely to be hooking up in later books.

1400069742|5.0|We often think of World War II as The Good War that enjoyed universal support.  \\"Those Angry Days\\" reminds us that such was not so at the beginning and that America's entry was, in many respects, a close run thing.  This book examines the debate over America's involvement in the war that took place from 1939-1941.  Although including many names we recognize, it focuses on President Franklin Roosevelt who was maneuvering to lead America into the war, and aviation hero Charles Lindbergh who was the most prominent isolationist opposing American entry.<br /><br />Author Lynne Olson skillfully lays out the characters, famous and obscure, as she guides the reader through the sequence of events that led to the fateful decision to become a belligerent.  Senators Burton Wheeler, Gerald Nye, Robert Taft and William Borah led the opposition to anything that threatened to bring the war closer to America's shores.  The isolationist America First organization's records included names that would later become famous including future Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart, future Ambassador to the Court of St. James, Kingman Brewster, Sargent, Gerald Ford and Gore Vidal.  Although not a member, John F. Kennedy sent a contribution.  Publisher William Allen White led the opposition \\"Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies\\".  Even the military was divided with Gen. Marshall and CNO Stark both opposing early aid to Britain as a drain on America's own defense.  Air Force Gen. Hap Arnold was suspected as being the source of a potentially damaging leak while other officers undermined efforts to bring America into the ranks of the warring powers.  British Ambassador Lord Lothian played a major role in swaying of American opinion toward Britain.  One key shifting point was when the generally isolationist Republican Party nominated interventionist Wendell Wilkie for President in 1940, eliminating the war as a campaign issue that year.<br /><br />These personalities contested a series of issues.  Repeal of the Neutrality act, Lend Lease, renewal of the draft, the Cash and Carry sale of war materials are just a few of the battles fought by interventionists and isolationists.  Throughout it all, the now seemingly invincible FDR played a political hand weakened by his failed court packing scheme.<br /><br />As the title indicates, anger and hatred were distinguishing characteristics of public discourse at that time.  Sen. Wheeler's comment that FDR's foreign policy would \\"plow every fourth boy under\\" and the claim that \\"Adolf Hitler nominated Wilkie\\" are just two examples of the invectives hurled by each side.<br /><br />Amidst all the dramatis personae Olson keeps returning to the Lindberghs, Charles and Anne, whose reputations rose and fell with the popularity of their public positions on the issues of war and peace.  The books they wrote and the speeches they made are followed in detail.<br /><br />America's great issues of 1939-1940 weave a complex web that that this book seeks to unravel.  The storyline is intriguing.  The story teller is magnificent.  The two cannot be better matched.  The author examines each character, with flaws and virtues, and probes each story from every angle.  I was impressed by Lynne Olson's \\"Citizens of London\\" (see my Amazon review) but this may have even outdone it.  For anyone who has ever pondered the question of how America entered World War II \\"Those Angry Days\\" is the \\"go to\\" book.f issues.

He tells the reader \\"First you will smile, and then you will cry - don't say you haven't been warned.\\"<br /><br />At the time of the annual homecoming dance Landon has a big problem.
