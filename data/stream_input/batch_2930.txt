B0041KKYBA|2.0|Here is the problem with this film, if you knew nothing about the economic collapse and wanted to learn something you really wouldn't come away from this knowing what happened, how it happened, what allowed it to happen or what we can do to prevent it from happening again. Because it failed in those areas I have to say that this whole documentary is pretty much a failure since it's claim was to give us \\"a closer look at what brought about the financial meltdown.\\"<br /><br />So here is the Good, the bad, and the ugly.<br /><br />GOOD<br /><br />Raghuram  Rajan - gave an excellent analysis of the problem<br /><br />It did talk about how the Lehman bankruptcy in America didn't cripple the ability to move its instruments but it did in MANY countries throughout the world due to their own bankruptcy laws. In many countries all of Lehman's financial instruments became absolutely worthless (according to their law)This one move probably exacerbated this crisis more by decimated the commercial paper market overnight and basically froze worldwide liquidity for over a year. Hank Paulson and Tim Geitner were responsible for this disastrous move yet it's hardly ever spoken off. I am glad this film mentioned it but it really needed to highlight it more and get into the Armageddon like effects that it had on the world economy.<br /><br />Highlights the immense lobbying that Wall Street does. That money certainly does buy influence.<br /><br />Highlights the revolving door between wall street firms and government<br /><br />BAD<br /><br />Talks about derivates and begins to crack the real problem behind this financial crises but then mysterious backs away and never mentions it again.<br /><br />Completely ignores FIRREA was passed in 1988 which took allowed derivatives to be unregulated instead it focuses on Brooksly Born's attempt to regulate them in 1998 (which would have been a good thing). However the film misleads the audience into thinking that it was some wall street bankers that stopped her attempt when in reality she couldn't legally do it unless congress either repealed FIRREA or wrote a whole new of laws.<br /><br />Barney Frank lied (well anytime that man opens his mouth it's probably a lie so no surprise there) and said that Phil Gramm and the CFMA law outlawed regulating derivatives when  in fact all that did was make clear that the CFTC falls under the aegis of FIRREA. The fix was in way back in 1988 that derivatives were unregulated instruments. They were NEVER deregulated; in FACT they were created as unregulated financial instruments. But you wouldn't know the history of this from watching this film and this unfortunately is a very important point if you wish to understand the HOW's and WHY's of the financial meltdown. Unfortunately those with ideological agendas want to continue this myth because it helps sell an ideological agenda rather than a truthful one.<br /><br />Credit Default Swaps, the actual real problem behind the meltdown was barely covered instead they focused on CDO's which was just a drop in the bucket. However I will give them kudos for even mentioning CDS's which most don't even tackle. However the film completely confuses and conflates CDO's and CDS's later. It repeatedly referred to CDS's (the real problem) as CDO's which was either sloppy film-making or purposefully done to mislead (which it was I don't know but in either case makes this a less than stellar production)<br /><br />Puts forth the myth that this economic collapse happened because of deregulation. The fact is we have tens of thousands of more regulations and thousands of more regulators and private watchdogs in the 2000's than we did during the supposedly safe banking era of the 1950's.  During the so-called deregulation era of 1980-2008 we had 6 major deregulatory laws in the financial sector during that same time we have 37 major regulatory laws passed.<br /><br />The film also blatantly lies about the saving and loan scandal of the 1980's. The reality is that many S&L officers went to jail for their actions, you can't go to jail if what you are doing was deregulated, instead you go to jail for breaking the regulations (laws). Once you understand this very simple fact the talking point that the S&Ls crises of the 80's happened due to deregulation crumbles in front of your face. Shame on the movie for misleading the audience.<br /><br />The film claims that by late 1990's Wall street had merged into \\"just a few gigantic firms that controlled everything\\"  - the facts however show a very different reality. In 1997 there were over 150 wall street firms with assets over 100 Million dollars, 40+ with assets over 500 Million. That's seems to be more than just a few imho.<br /><br />The film asks a question about how many times Apple or Intel have been fined and of course the answer then (Apple just got majorly fined for price collusion) was never but that begs the question. How many regulators are going over apple's or Intel's books or business practices. Answer ZERO. How many are going over the financial industry? Answer 3,714 according to the US government. This question is as stupid as asking a how many tickets are written in a area highly policed vs an area with no police. Of course there will be more tickets and fines where there are more cops.<br /><br />The film lies about the so-called \\"old system\\" of lending. When a homeowner made a payment on the loan it went to the local lender. This is fantasy, to help banks out after the great depression FDR allowed banks to START selling their home mortgages in 1938.  The \\"old system of lending that the film refers to is a myth or they are referring to lending practices that predate the great depression, either way the film is misleading the viewers once again.<br /><br />The film correctly points out that the lenders no longer cared about the ability of the person to pay their loan since they were being packaged and sold at a furious rate but the film NEVER once explained to us about the very IMPORTANT deregulation of banks that occurred that allowed them to loan people money they knew couldn't repay it. Remember, there were laws on the books beforehand that limited banks from writing these types of loans but you would NEVER know that from this film. You also would never know about the regulations that forced banks to make certain loans in order to be allowed to sell their loans later. Again the film is ominously silent about some of the real deregulation that occurred and some of the regulation that actually pushed us into this mess. Instead it wants' a very neat narrative that it was all wall street's fault but the simple fact of the matter is that is not true.<br /><br />UGLY<br /><br />The film completely Ignores the fact that Iceland was one of Europe's Poorest countries and transformed itself into one of Europe's Wealthiest through its strong banking industry, energy companies and manufacturing sector. Ironically the film demonizes the very industries that made Iceland rise to the top and become the utopian Mecca that the film tries to portray it as. A fair and even handed review would have been better, that the old socialistic ways of Iceland mired it's people in poverty and debt which was actually worse than the outcome of the collapse<br /><br />The film completely distorts the Icelandic banking industry. It tries to make hay that the three largest banks borrowed 120 Billion dollars in a five year period but knowing that number is irrelevant without context. The reality is they borrowed 120  billion dollars but had 150 billion in assets which is a much higher reserve ration than banks in any other western country have.<br /><br />The film complains that government regulators in Iceland did nothing which is again irrelevant since Iceland's banks didn't do anything wrong. The fact is if the economy hadn't collapsed than Iceland's banks would still be solvent.<br /><br />George Soros lying about not knowing what CDS's are when he in fact has used them over and over to enrich himself.<br /><br />The film completely misleads the viewer about the housing bubble. It claims that home prices skyrocketed because anybody could get a mortgage (this is partially true), but it doesn't explain why only SOME areas had bubbles and others didn't. The easiest way to explain this is that not all areas were forced to participate in government lending practices due to their demographics. Those areas had stricter loan requirements and much less, if any real estate bubbles. Other areas were highly targeted by the new rules so in order to be able to package and sell loans (which is how banks made money) they had to write many more risky loans. Once again the film ignore this and misleads the viewer.<br /><br />The video also mislead people about the zeal of government and quasi government agencies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to push sub-prime products. With the government backing these ludicrous loans there was no reason for the mortgage industry not to go to town and sell a bunch of loans they knew were highly questionable.<br /><br />In probably the most Orwellian of all moves this film interviews Barney Frank as portrays him as a person who tried to solve this mess. This is literally a Black is white, up is down, war is peace claim. 6 pieces of legislation were put forth by different members of congress and even President Bush to regulate the housing markets and lending institutions. Barney Frank, being a highly paid off member of congress that received millions from these industries fought tooth and nail against any leverage. He is record multiple times saying there is nothing wrong and people who want to regulate these industries are only doing so out of racist motivations. By picking Barney Frank as a spokesperson this film loses virtually all of it's credibility and to be honest the American public should be pissed at the filmmaker for thinking that we are that stupid to not know this.<br /><br />The movie also tries to make hay about the ratings companies \\"opinions\\" aka ratings. I've read a lot of these ratings and every time they ratings are disclosed as only the opinion of the firm at the time they give them and with the information they have. In other words they are thinly veiled marketing programs that are meant to give the buyer a sense security. Nobody who deals with financial instruments even thought anything different about them but the film makes this out to be a huge scandal. Think of it this way. Before the crash I had a piece of property appraised at $1.3 million dollars and I could have sold it for that pretty easily. After the crash the appraisal came back at $740,000.  The fact is the appraisal is the opinion of the appraiser at THAT TIME in history with all of the facts they have THEN. BOTH were valid under the circumstances that they gave me their opinion of the worth of my property. There is no wrong-doing in this no matter how the film tries to present it.<br /><br />The film lied about personal taxes. After the bush Tax cuts America's tax became more progressive, which is what the left WANTS but instead they decry them as being unfair. The fact is America has the most progressive tax structure of all the OECD nations. Part of our economic instability IS this extreme progressiveness of taxes. No nation can rely on a very small percentage of people to supply the government income. In fact socialist Sweden has lectured President Obama on this very issue and has warned the international banking community that unless we make our tax system a \\"more egalitarian\\" system that we will continue to increase our debt at record rates. The irony is that many socialists nations tried exactly what we have done with their taxes and it failed miserably as it is here. Currently the tax rates in socialist countries in Europe are much more egalitarian (less progressive) than Americas and it has helped them before and after the economic downturn. For some reason America's policy seems to want to double down on Bush's push for a highly progressive tax structure and make it even more progressive, something that only leads to disaster.<br /><br />The film claims that America's wealth is the most unequal of any first tier nation - this is true but what it doesn't tell you is there is a correlation between all nations wealth inequality and progressive tax structure. Ironically the more progressive the tax structure the higher the wealth inequality. France, Sweden, Germany, etc etc all experienced this in the 60's and 70's. Then when their debt began rising and services had to be cut they made a change to egalitarian tax structures. The first thing that did was reduce debt and then reduce inequality. Currently France is doing the opposite, making their tax system much more progressive and two years later we have seen a rise in inequality in France. Germany and Sweden resisted this idea and there has been no rise. Hmmmmmm, it really doesn't take a PhD to figure this stuff out people.<br /><br />Criminal prosecution was the weakest claim of the film. First of all think about this logically. What did anyone do that was \\"illegal\\"? The fact is there was very little if any illegal acts that were committed. Sketchy Loans were made that the US government allowed by changing rules and regulation and then rewarding the lenders for making these loans. CDO's and CDS's were claimed off-limit from regulations by the US government so they were able to operate without a framework of rules. Investment houses hedges bets, which is NOT illegal and they do it every second of every trading day. The investment houses highly leveraged themselves to the extent that the law allowed. In the end, no matter how wrong we think it is, there was very little if any illegal activities done, so those looking for a scapegoat or crying out for prosecuting someone are being illogical.<br /><br />If you still don't understand how this can be just imagine this. There is NO speed Limit, there is no law against drinking and driving. You get totally smashed, get behind your supped up sports car and barrel down the highway at night in the rain doing 140 MPH. You lose control, cross the center line and crash headfirst into a van carrying a family of  six. You kill them all, yet miraculously you survive. What law did you break?????  Now don't get me wrong I'm not arguing that there should be NO law against this sort of behavior - there SHOULD, but we can't prosecute someone for something that wasn't against the law when they did it. What we need to do is CHANGE the LAW.<br /><br />Bottom Line: You really won't learn a whole lot of verifiable facts from this film but you may be mislead or misinformed.DS's are when he in fact has used them over and over to enrich himself.<br /><br />The film completely misleads the viewer about the housing bubble.

0744014956|3.0|This is one of those hardbound, \\"collectors\\" type game guides for GTA V. A poster is included, and in-depth strategies cover the entirety of the game. These type of books have had a hard time since the Internet, as most game-related questions can easily be found on the Internet. The printing is well-down and so is the binding quality.<br /><br />Personally, however, if Prima publishes a guide, I would recommend you go with that, as I prefer their styles. Or, better yet, save your money and find the info you are looking for online for free.
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|All the levels were solveable without getting hopelessly stuck. Some were actually fairly easy leaving you feeling extra smart!  However, it was over much too soon for a paid game. Granted, it was only a dollar but still, felt more like a free trial.  Finished in only a few hours....which I guess is also a measure of the addictiveness.

B00F35B8F8|4.0|I didn't think I would enjoy the new star trek movies being I'm an old school fan, but I have to say both Star Trek and Star Trek Into the Darkness didn't disappoint. I like how JJ Abrams throws in little hints to the original characters while still keeping things fresh and new. The Wrath of Khan was my favorite, and this movie has it's own spin on Khan which I liked.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|My boyfriend and I ordered 2 of these. One for him, and one for his dad for father's day. It was a great hit with him, as when he got home from work, he was trying to sharpen all the dull knives in the drawer. He looked like a kid with a favorite piece of candy. Also when he gave it to his dad, he said it he seemed really impressed with it. It is something that I would recommend to everyone who needs knives sharpened.

B000002UVX|4.0|Old school!!! love this cd and plan to put it to good use. It arrived in the condition stated when I purchased.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Awesome Anthology package. I got this as one of the deal for 19.99 and it is worth every penny. The there are the 4 movie discs and the 2 special feature disks. Each movie disc has the theatrical version and the director cut version.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Insightful philosophy of our relationship with the big picture. Truly an epic work explaining the mechanics of how to free ourselves from darkness and live in the light.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|All the songs on this cd are awsome but just like some of the other reviewers have said not all songs from the movie are on cd. That being said have listened to the album over and over, and I am glad i did get it.

B0052AC8C6|4.0|Most of the funny scenes I have seen in a series that is only partially available in the US. Never-the-less I had several good laughs and think many would enjoy this movie.

0385528787|4.0|At last, we have the conclusion of the MaddAddam Trilogy. MaddAddam picks up where the previous two novels in the series (Oryx and Crake, The Year of the Flood) converge. While one could get away with only reading MaddAddam (there's a brief synopsis of the first two books at the beginning), I would not recommend it.<br /><br />For those not familiar with Margaret Atwood, there is no other way to say it; Atwood's post apocalyptic future is both terrifying and stunning.<br /><br />This is definitely a must read trilogy!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|We know very little about Jesus from birth to the age of 30.  This books brings the time period to light and I enjoyed reading about all the factions that conquered Jerusulam and how this impacted the people and cultures.  Now looking at Jesus against these times and who were the people at the top of the food chain to the lowest of the poor.  From this a picture of Jesus emerges and this makes for an easily readible book.  Jesus is treated by the author as a strong, energetic prophet who preached love and non-violence.  A zealot yes....armed only with words but he was charismatic especially for a Jewish population who were at the mercy of the temple priests and the Romans who owned the priests.  Very enjoyable read!
B004J4WLB4|3.0|An interesting theme for a book, however I found Victoria's behavior inconsistent, too rigid and implausible. Likewise for Elizabeth, Renata, & Grant. The characters were either too forgiving or their actions were unsubstantiated. Most of the book was too predictable as a result. It seemed as though the author was trying so hard to make her lead character different from the norm, and as a result her plot became the same old - same old, that you find everywhere.<br />Amazon should do a much better job of proof reading. All too often there are repeated words and incorrect syntax, which leads (for me) to dissatisfaction with my enjoyment of reading.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|In a flight of fantasy, Owen's character explores his life through the eyes of real-life authors, artists, and gad-flies to reach a personal understanding and a new beginning.  It is a fun voyage!

B009KS4XRO|3.0|I've played this game for a long while...before buffalo studios sold it to Caesars.  Due to the sale certain things have changed and not for the better.  Here's the straight talk:<br />1.  New rooms are very difficult to complete and take a lot of credits.  If you are familiar with this:  bingo credits are used to buy the BINGO cards. The cards cost anywhere from 5-13 bingo credits per card.  You get to collect bingo credits daily, once every 24 hours. So, when the cards cost 48 credits and you only get 10o/day....this tells you how many times you can play daily.  You can purchase credits with your debit or credit card.  The game is organized by rooms, New York, Vienna, Moscow, Miami, etc.  It is also organized by levels, 1-125 or more.  When you level up you get credits but leveling up takes time and credits.  The rooms have puzzle pieces you have to get so you can complete the room and get credits that way, but some pieces are very difficult to get.  You have to play sometimes for months depending on your luck to complete.  Some rooms are locked out if you are not high enough level wise.  For example, in order to play Vienna you need to be at level 105.<br />2.  Items or puzzle pieces you could trade with other players which would allow the rooms to be completed faster especially on a hard to get item.  Now, tks to the new owners, some rooms have pieces you can't trade for therefore it takes longer and more credits which translates to buying credits for a free game....I call it pure greed by Caesars.<br />3.  Tech support or customer service is pretty much no existent.<br />4.  They changed,not to the players advantage, how many gifts a player receives.  For example, for the slot rooms you could collect as many free spins in a day as many times as you log in.  Now, you are only allowed to collect 25 every 12 hours.  Sucks.  They changed slot of other things also and not for the best.<br />I hope this helps.  I still play it, it's just not as much fun as it used tobe.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|My grand kids love this movie and love to dance to the music...could have expanded story more for me but they loved it!!!
B004TMPJP6|4.0|The best task tracker I have ever seen!!!!  Ability to have due date and recurring task is awesome and incredibly helpful!!<br /><br />I have my shopping list, office to-do's, birthdays, yearly home maintenance, and much more in this app.<br /><br />Note of caution ... be very careful when sinking or you will lose everything and it sucks!!<br /><br />Thank you WonderList!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|loved the game! very challening at times. can't wait for more rooms. would be nice to have a hint button sometimes.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Incomprehesible, boring, confusing and insulting. Do not waste your money on this movie, despite who is in it. It's bad.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This seems to cover most of the weather information that I need. It gives me the hour by hour weather predictions. As you start to enter the name of a town or city, a drop-down menu appears that you can choose from. It allows me to enter several locations so I can see what the weather will be for locations that I am traveling to, again on an hourly basis. It also gives me options on weather maps. It even shows me if it is going to be cloudy, if I have that option turned on in the settings.<br /><br />I see here in the comments where people are saying that the free version has more options. I just downloaded the free version and compared them. I don't see any difference, except that the bottom of the free version is filled with advertising.<br /><br />Unless you are a pilot or are in a boat in the middle of an ocean, this should fill most people's need for weather information.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This read was fast for me, I was sucked in immediately. The story read with vivid imagery in my mind...as a new mother, I found it to be deeply connecting in ways- the flowers, the love, and the fear- all resonate together. Written in a captivating manner, I would recommend this book for sure.
1455113549|5.0|One of the best books I have read lately.  Great characters.  Great plot.  Great setting.  Again - why do you need to type more words to say the same thing?
1250012570|5.0|I have heard there is some group saying this book is inappropriate as a YA book. I am thinking the library this group has taken control of (as in terrorist taking control) would also ban books that have become literary classics, as this book may just become in our future. Honest writing is not inappropriate. I would recommend this book to my friends AND high school students.
0739441671|4.0|Enjoyed the story.  I liked the characters and the trouble they stirred up.  It definitely kept my attention throughout the book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As I said, it's really not the sex that makes these three books so fascinating.  In fact, at times, the sex gets grating at the least, or, in the worst cases, cringeworthy.  I don't know what the big deal is.  BDSM appeals to some, I guess, but it's mostly just boring and silly, much of the time.<br /><br />What makes these books fascinating is the love story.  Christian Grey is a man who loves a woman.  Ana.  He loves her, and is willing to do anything at all to keep her.  Including changing who he thinks he fundamentally is. He pursues her with a single minded passion that appeals to all women.  I don't care who you are.  If you're a woman, you will love this man.<br /><br />It's immaterial that there doesn't seem to be any visible reason why he'd be attracted to Ana over others.  Love is just that way.  Once the heart decides on its target, its aim is true.<br /><br />These books aren't monumental works of art.  They aren't literary masterpieces.  They aren't even the first of this genre to be popular.  We can look to \\"The Story of O\\", or the books of De Sade for the proof of that.  However, I haven't read anything in this genre before now that rates as a classic love story.<br /><br />It's a story of obsessive and all-encompassing love.  The breadth of the love will sweep you away.  It's like Twilight, in that regard.  No one would call Twilight great literature.  It's really kind of dumb, to be honest.  And, 50 Shades also rates that evaluation.  No matter.  These books will still probably resonate after we're all dead and gone.<br /><br />It's the romance, stupid.  Not the BDSM.  Buy them and read them.  If, for no other reason, you need a frame of reference for cocktail party chat.  (That's actually the reason I read them.  I needed to know what my friends were talking about.)  It was more than worth my time.  (I read them three times.)  You just don't see love stories like this very often.
B00AXVIHBU|5.0|An Excellent Season and series ! Of course no one wants to see certain characters leave the show but that's the way it is. The series is done very well and we look forward to season 4.
B004GXAZL6|5.0|very enthralling and very unpredictable – a really good read thoroughly enjoyed and hopefully it is not the end of the Camel Club should be good for one or two more books.as the membership list grows
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Well written and researched book that presents a unique perspective of Jesus and the early christian movement. I felt the author was at times selective with his interpretation of historical events and writings in order to support his position that Jesus was a social activist amongst many activist of his time. As a religious scholar and historian Aslan is naturally skeptical of anything not supported by solid documentation yet the book highlights the challenges of writing about a transformative, religious figure where faith and miracles play an integral part of the narrative.
B008F5Y7UQ|4.0|This movie was simple and engaging and easy to watch.<br />You were drawn into the plot very easily.<br />Unusual plot.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great game.  have different challenges. can keep you focuse and busy for. a really. long time. I really love it!!!
B00CIU3IVS|5.0|I absolutely love this album. The music is very unique and I have listened to it over and over! It's worth a listen regardless of what music you typically listen to.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Christian is an alpha male that melts when he melts when it comes to his lady. He tries to remain macho, but he can't help but give in to the woman he loves.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Another great book written by Dan Brown. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Love how much work goes into his books so there is truth to the stories!
1451668945|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy reading Mary Higgins Clark's books. After waiting a month for the library to get it in but never did so I am glad I ordered it from Amazon. I can always can always count on their fast and efficient service.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|Linked In originally was primarily for recruiters but it has morphed into a great networking site . I use it fairly often.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Love these books.  The only issue with buying this bundle is that they are considered one book on the Kindle.  So, there is no good way to tell how far through one particular book you are.<br /><br />Certainly not a deal breaker, but you would think that could be figured out pretty easily...
B001NLL93W|5.0|I love this book! I recommend to all people that love forbidden romance and suspense cuz this book has it.
B00130VLZ4|5.0|Keeps my camera save in my purse. If you looking for something to hold more items, then this case is not for you.<br />I was looking only for something to cover my camera from any kind of damage in my purse. Extra items I just keep on my purse.<br />I did not wanted to carry two bags. My purse and on top of of it a camera bag.<br />It worked out just fine for me.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I loved this book because there is where a lot of the confusing and action. lots more to the story and I love how there is always a forbidden love and suspense after every chapter. GET THIS BOOK!!!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl Sandbreg has the strength to speak the truth and encourage women to not just lean in, but feel great about doing it.  After reading this book there is no way you can sit along the edges any longer.  Lean in!
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|I can't believe they made us wait 4 years...for THIS?! After establishing the alternate reality plot device that enabled the filmmakers to have the lovable, mostly well cast...cast of characters we've come to love, have all new adventures, did the filmmakers offer up a new, original adventure??? The answer is a highly dissappointed \\"NO\\"! What a lackluster Star Trek! I think most of the good reviews are from those under 35. This one is about as good as Nemesis, but not quite. The music wasnt memorable, heck nothing in this movie was memorable. I felt like I was watching every other movie, except the one I was watching. Avatar, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan- the bad remake, among others. What a waste of time, money, and Leonard Nimoy! How does Khan turn from a Spanish/middle Easterner with a believable strengh into a pale, British, Marvel comic book character? How does Carol Marcus have a British accent? They take direct lines and scenes from \\"The Wrath Of Khan\\" switch the roles around and call it something new? LAME, Lame, lame! Its now obvious Chris Pine is badly miscast, and its time to recast Uhura with a younger actress (Zoe Saldana is not aging as well as Nichelle Nichols did, she looks hungover and half asleep throughout) Its also time to abandon the Spock/Uhura romance, it just doesn't work. So, now that Mr. J.J. has railroaded Star Trek, his next target is Star Wars? Didn't there used to be a rule that if you did one genre franchise you didn't get to do another, unless your Spielberg? What happened to that rule? Hmmm...
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This is an awesome app. the best out there for djing. this definitely shouldn't be free considering everything it does and how easy it handles.it even has automix. traktor doesn't even have that
B008M721MS|5.0|I love skyping with family but, I can't always make time to sit in front of my computer……so having Skype Kindle makes it so easy to walk around my house while  I'm chatting  away....sometimes it's with my sister while I'm cook or showing my mom my son dancing in the living room....Skype Kindle loads fast & the clarity is great...the sound is great too...I'm skyping from India to the U.S. and I love it!  I have absolutely no complaints!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Game is full of puzzles to search through... cons are one does burn through energy fast which you will understand once you start playing.... so far am not bored of and barely even dented it with hours of play time
0374275637|5.0|Interesting and very well written. Book discusses in an easily understood way some of the research that won him a Nobel Prize, on how we think and make  decisions.  After reading this book you may want to be sure you use the &#34;slow thinking&#34; part of you brain in making important decisions.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It does the math great, very handy in situations where I need to do math. I did the review so the pop up would stop.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very cool game. It definitely lives up to the high rating. I was very glad I downloaded this app. Give it a try.
1444737112|4.0|I would like to find out if he is living better now, enough to eat etc.  I may read the second book to see how he is doing.
B000KIPT30|4.0|Got this to send out headphone leads to vocalist and instrumentalist.  Build quality is sturdy, annoying that it uses AC power, cord isn't as long as it could be, so finding optimal placement can be annoying.  Otherwise great product
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|Not your usual romantic movie, but a great idea. It reminds me of &#34;Another Earth&#34; about a world parallel to ours. But, in &#34;Upside Down&#34;, the parallel world was  accessible. As usual, it portrays what people are willing to do to reach that special someone.
B005LAII80|5.0|The trailer does this movie no justice. It is a great action/science fiction piece that is true to the comic and to the world. You don't have to blow up New York or save the world in every single movie, and Ma-Ma is more than enough villain for this piece.<br /><br />My only caveat would be that they need to greenlight a sequel as soon as possible.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I love hidden object game and this one is a very nice one. Liked all the different items I had to look for. Keep up the good work!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Short and sweet. Do yourself a favor spend a few extra bucks and go wither the Roku or Apple TV!<br /><br />This thing was hard to set up with terrible directions and troubleshooting tips.<br /><br />RETURNING MINE after day 1!
1401238580|5.0|Art is some of my all time favorite and the cryptic story comes together beautifully at the end of each book.
B009LDD54K|5.0|We loved season 1 & 2, and season 3 so far is very entertaining. A few surprises that you do not expect, well written as usual. Nuckey is having a bad year, lots of crazy stuff going on!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Even though there are the devout Star Trek fan boys and girls (oh I'm sorry... AKA hardcore Trekkies) out there that have made the original Star Trek universe their whole lives, and enjoy nothing more than pointing out the inaccuracies in J.J. Abram's reboot, this film in my opinion is outstanding. It is these types of people that need to realize that doing a complete re-hash of old material, just with a white wash of modern-day special effects, set design, etc. is not going to sell movie tickets and keep butts in the seats. You need to have at least a dash of something new to keep things fresh, and interesting.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD:<br />J.J. has found a way to bring the Star Trek universe to the masses with a recipe that just works. This film is yet another action packed sci-fi drama with a spattering of humorous moments. Without being too overly derivative (as the fan boys/girls would like), Star Trek Into Darkness has its roots in the original second Star Trek film, \\"Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan.\\" Using elements that worked in J.J.'s first Star trek film (2009), Star Trek Into Darkness fuses these elements with some of the most iconic moments of the original but, with a twist to accommodate the alternate reality introduced to us in 2009.<br /><br />Now I did find some parts to be silly like: the treatment of the Star Fleet admiral (I can't explain why, you'll just have to form your opinion; that is just what I took away from his performance), and possibly even more importantly... how come no body else privy to the information Kirk (Chris Pine) was reviewing in the mandated meeting of Star Fleet Captains and their First Officers was able to jump to the conclusion he did (just before Khan [Benedict Cumberbatch] lit the room up) but, I digress. I realize that this scene moves the plot along but still. Nevertheless, Star Trek Into Darkness is a fantastic film; in a otherwise somewhat lack-luster field of blockbusters this summer, I really don't see where there is room to complain as fervently as some other people are about this film.e is room to complain as fervently as some other people are about this film.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this series from beginning to end! No flaws and continued to shock and awe with the turn of each page.
B001F63D66|5.0|I was not expecting to receive the SD rental of this movie with the purchase of the Blu-ray verion for free. Thank you Amazon for that little bonus. Now about the movie... this of course isn't something you are going to sit down and watch with little kids or conservative parents around but, this film is still one of my favorites. I really enjoy how Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert's character's infatuation blossoms into a romance among some stiff (pun not intended) competition.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I loved this book. I stayed up till 12:00 o clock . I would recommend this book. Just buy it or rent it.I hope you have a good time reading
0061950726|5.0|This story will make you care about the characters and bring tears to your eyes. I learned so much about the realities of life in the early 1920&#34;s that was never brought to my attention before. I had extensive family living in New York during those years and never heard about the orphan trains. How can it be that 200,000 children rode these trains and yet that fact is not in any history books?
B003V4AK8E|5.0|No complaints. Good weight and grips. I'm not a serious gamer, I bought it for the kids and they love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I can do more things on this game than any other horse game.  You can earn gAme money really fast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. This is so cool and fun.Really awesome  .Make a part 2 4your fans .Thanks for it. Great good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Take your mind on a trip from begining to end. Music for the mind, body & soul!  This is an awesome album
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|This is a really well written program. The characters are sharp and witty, and the plot interesting. It's like a fantastic book that can't be put down. I hope 'Suits' will have a long and prosperous life.
B008PZZYB2|3.0|This movie is Fun for a some laughs. Something I watch once in a while when I need something silly.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|The story line is the only thing worst than the plot. Probably, the worst Sci-Fic movie in the last 20 years.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent book.  It had everything you could want in a book...history, a great mix of characters, rich story line etc.  He's a fantastic writer.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I found the types of choices confusing since I am accustomed to the 3 from the deck method of play.  I still prefer to play on my desk top and only play on my Kindle when I am in transit.
140006922X|4.0|I found \\"Zealot\\" to be a very interesting read. The book attempts to explain the persona of Jesus while taking into account the beliefs,norms,and customs of the historical time period. I liked that the author never intimated that Jesus was a myth, but instead used research based on a myriad of historical and significant writings of the time to explain the writers of the Bible and other religious texts.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|It's silly and highly addictive. Lots of fun to play when you want to do something without using too much brainpower.
B00DJYKFXG|1.0|First off, the music is great. But, if, like me, you have bought prior editions of rock of ages (especially the 2 cd version issued in 2001) you are basically getting 19 songs (no new ones, only new versions of whats out there plus only 2 clips on the dvd) for $70 plus dollars-----there is no value for the money here---and its almost disrespectful to long-time fans being asked to once again purchase what we have already bought in the past not once, but twice here (see the 5.1 audio dvd disc).....no wonder the music business is suffering------great music but i recommend the 3 disc Rock of Ages issued in 2000 or 2001---it has all you really need---and is a great value
1932100660|5.0|This book is very informative with proof and statistics to back up all the findings. It is a real life changer for the best.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I never will buy batteries at store as long as this guy keeps making deals! Awesome deal. 5 for less than half price of 1 if I bought in the store.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This is one of the best series I have had the pleasure of reading.  The last book is action packed, with more than one twist and turn of events.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Quiet is a most positive book that validates the Introvert. It is based on extensive research and insight.<br />It beautifully demonstrates the value of both introverts and extroverts in society. Very uplifting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. My girlfriend and I challenge each all the time and my nephew loves to play/watch too.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book!  I cried my eyes out, very sad and funny at the same time. This book made me laugh out loud and I rooted for Hazel and Augustus. This will make a great movie and I hope that it happens soon! Kudos to Mr. Green!
B0090EJ99A|4.0|This is a very funny movie. Has some true political aspects but it tells a story that is lived by some presidents today
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|If your looking for a book to brighten your spirits this one isn't it. It had a good meaning behind it and it kept you interested.
B00A285OOW|2.0|Weak story, no character development.  The end is as uninspiring as the entire book.  Don't bother reading this book, not worth your time.
B00DXP0QX0|5.0|I love Rod Stewart and this is just one more great CD to add to my collection. Go for it!
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|This is Gregory Porter's greatly anticipated third album and his first on Blue Note.  For his first, \\"Water\\", he received a grammy nomination in the category of Best Jazz Vocal.  His second offering, \\"Be Good\\" gained him a grammy nomination in the category of Best Traditional R&B.  With his third, \\"Liquid Spirit\\" maybe he'll get nomination in two or three categories because even though he is known as a jazz singer, you cannot deny his strong roots in R&B, Blues & Gospel.<br />Many people have compared him to the likes of Sam Cooke, Bill Withers, Otis Redding, Lou Rawls, Les McCann, Johnny Hartman and of course, Nat King Cole.  Why do we search for a comparison?  I can only think it's because the authenticity & intimacy in his voice and lyrics, makes us happy & comfortable and familiar only because it's like we are listening to an old friend...A friend we have known for many years....we know this guy...he is US.<br />It has been said that jazz is a powerful, living, breathing art form that uplifts, connects and transforms us.  In my opinion, that is just what he does.  He can transform his sounds into something new, yet familiar.  His lyrics communicate specific emotional, spiritual and intellectual life, with an approach of perfect pitch and all wrapped up with a whole bunch of soul.<br />Some of the highlights for me are \\"No Love Dying\\" and \\"I Fall In Love Too Easily\\" beautifully telling us that mistakes in love may be where pain comes from but ultimately it is also the source of great joy.  \\"Lonesome Lover\\" written by Abbey Lincoln & Max Roach, never got the play that it deserved and Porter keeps the song's integrity but makes it new and now, maybe it will be included in the Great American Songbook (where it belongs). \\"Musical Genocide\\" tells us how we cannot forget music's past.  \\"The In Crowd\\" and \\"Movin'\\" take us back in time, kickin' it old school, and making us smile in contentment.  \\"Liquid Spirit\\" is a hand clapping, goin' to church, testifying, rockin' song that if you don't feel good after hearing it, you better call the undertaker, because you must be dead! And most importantly, \\"When Love Was King\\", with lyrics that have a \\"Nature Boy\\" vibe but also for me, I thought of Ellington's \\"Is God A Three Letter Word For Love\\", in it's intent.  Some critics might find it sappy but I found it to be a beautiful melody with a very poignant yet hopeful lyric.<br />And like the good friend that we feel he is, he has kept his great personnel with him from his previous recordings.  If it's working, don't mess up a good thing!  And it's quite apparent that he shares a sibling like simpatico with collaborator & pianist, Chip Crawford, who adds so much to this album.<br />The rest of the personnel are all standouts too.  They are, Yosuke Sato, Alto Sax; Tivon Pennicott, Tenor Sax; Aaron James, Double Bass; Emanuel Harold, Drums.<br />The only thing that could have made this even better is if it were a \\"live\\" performance because after all in jazz, it's the \\"for the moment\\" sets that jazz is all about.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|it worked the first couple of months then all of a sudden it wouldn't show my messages I got or my notifications. I tried to re install it but it wouldn't work. it says open app and when I press the open button it doesn't work. not happy at all.
B008GBCMHO|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid, and this is now my son's favorite movie!  It's simpler animation compared to the new CG animation of today is very refreshing.  Great songs, great music!  So happy I was able to purchase this for my Kindle!
B00B00RJJO|5.0|Sit down.  Kick off your shoes and listen.  For those of us of a certain age, and of a very particular kind of experience, the playlist of \\"Tooth & Nail\\" will feel familiar and sound throughout our souls.  You may at first be attracted by the rousing \\"There will be a reckoning\\", but you will want to stay for the funny and poignant messages portrayed by Bragg as he paints a portrait of a poetic handyman or prepares for the funeral of a loved one.  The romantic loveliness of \\"Your Name on My Tongue\\" will linger in your heart, accompanied by a musical arrangement that will send that same heart soaring.  Bragg is a craftsman musician and songster.  These songs will break your heart - and I mean that in the best of ways.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This certainly brought back memories of when I was a kid sitting on the floor in front of the T.V. playing the Atari.  It's a great game the only downside is, I couldn't find any directions.  I had to just find out by jumping right in and playing it.  I would recommend this game to friends.  :o)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  I may have  to take a break before diving into the 2nd book.  Very intense to say the least.  Looking forward to watching season 1 on HBO.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My kids just love all toca games, very well designed, knows it's public, unbeatable. If you have little ones around, this game will have them entertained for hours and hours.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|Gives good guide to evaluate and upgrade your business. Easy reading lecture. Step by step busines strategy description.  Very practical
B00ANAC32U|4.0|Very comfortable and elegant. It will protect the corners in a fall, but I'm not so sure about the screen...
B00881VLCE|1.0|Then they updated it. I can't even open it--it just keeps crashing! do not waste hour time or money. Check out the recent reviews--it's the same complaint over and over. They should have taken the age old advice: if it ain't broke,don't fix it!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I just tried my updated App for the first time, and I'm blown away.  It's a 1000% improvement.  Way to go, Kindle guys!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|This show is like life after glee and way more scandalous. I wish Marilyn was a real musical. I love how rehearsals are like they are actually performing the show.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|I found the book to be interesting, but found that it included more detail than I needed.  I found myself trying to hit the highlights sometimes.  This is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. It helps clarify the differences in what those in developed countries would call progress in various areas of the world.  It also lays to rest some of the theories based on the supposed difference in intelligence of different races. I never believed these theories, but the explanations given it this book make a lot more sense in terms of why people in different parts of the world progressed at different rates. It also highlights the complexity of reasons for the different rates of progress. Those who push certain theories are often looking for one simple explanation, but I don't believe there is one.
1616550414|5.0|This book was twice the price at a Mall store.  I came home and ordered it through Amazon Prime.  I ordered it on a Saturday night and had it Tuesday morning.  It came wrapped and nicely packaged.  All I can say is, look at the hundreds and hundreds of reviews that are 4 and 5 stars and only a handful of negatives.  It's a really cool book.  I'm an original Zelda fan and my son is just a Zelda fan across the board.  We loved this book.  Hardcover.  Absolutely worth $20.
B00821OX98|2.0|Up front I'll admit that I only watched the first 5 minutes or so of S1E1.<br /><br />I wish that this method hadn't proved a near perfect predictor in the past of how I felt about a show if I stayed with it through at least a couple of episodes.<br /><br />Nothing in the first 5 minutes piqued my curiosity at all.  The imagery, the style, and the probable nature of the story line and characters..., been there, done that, dozens of times before.
B008J5G1TW|5.0|I had read some reviews on these sandals prior to purchase and one thing that was noted was that they tend to run about 1/2 size small. So I placed the ordered for 1/2 size bigger and that work perfect for me, They fit well and are very comfortable. Have only had them for about one week so I can't say how they will hold up in the long run but from looking at the quality of material and craftsmanship I don't foresee any issues.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|While the movie wasn't extraordinarily compelling in and of itself, it was well written and filmed, the effects were good and they managed to make a whole movie out of a bedtime story.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Each and every one of the players that stood and fought, the  women who sacrificed all, had their own loyalties and can justify their cause. Whose to say who was right or wrong and whatever the outcome was God's will but what we do know for a fact is that combined these threads are woven to create the future.
B003RT0NK8|5.0|this movie starts out as a beautifully written and filmed story about the mental degradation created by responsibility over the future of the human race. The second half of the movie goes a little off track and somewhat hampers the promise of the first half. However, it is certainly worth watching. If you love sci fi movies or appreciate Danny Boyle's directing and ability to deliver visually stunning cinematography, then this is a must-see. This is a bit like Event Horizon in that it's a strange mix of horror, action, and drama in the same movie.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|For the first story in a trilogy it is not as complete as most. The end is not a resolution point allowing it to stand on its own. Still the character development is complete enough to make you care and the mystery surrounding the backgrounds and capabilities of the main characters make you look forward to continuing the story.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I never could get it to work between my Mac and my husband's Kindle.  We removed it from both devices.
B002A9VJ40|5.0|Great movie and 1 of my all time favorites. I have watched this movie at least 30 times. Watch it and you will understand.
B001NZXI5U|4.0|Germany since... well, Ever! This album stands toe to toe with the best from their peers, back in the day, I believe. Ratt, Quiet Riot, Def Leppard, you name it. Fantastic rockin' album I^^I>
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Just absolutely love this song! Can't wait to buy the whole CD! Lady gaga just knows how to say things through her music!
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Dark, but absolutely unreal.  Kevin Spacey is amazing.  He's brilliant, but slightly evil.  Even if you aren't into politics, it's easy to follow.  Highly suggest this series!!!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This is an extraordinary book. Contagious, inspires, and provides some simple but powerful tips that will boost your creative activities... no matter in which field you are involved. Highly recommendable!
B00CHILW64|5.0|Needless to say, it's a tear-jerker.  I don't cry easily and I counted 5 different times throughout the movie that I cried, stream of tears each time!!  Such an amazing story.  It really stuck with me days after I watched it.  I always wondered how strong the water was, what I would have done, if I would have made it out alive.  This movie shows a really amazing depiction of the tsunami itself.  It felt so real.  It's not too graphic, definitely not appropriate for kids under 12 though.  Everyone over 12 should see this.  I think they'll get a better sense of the tsunami and it's impact (at the very least).  It's a touching story of family, love, and never giving up as well!
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|This will become a classic if not already. Excellent story that is just funny from beginning to end. Stay for the last after credits. All did an excellent job acting in this movie. One of my all time favorites. Pure entertainment without any raunchy language at all.
0634022296|5.0|I rated this book 5 star because it has all the Beatles songs in it I love. The chords are great for easy learning. I listen to the songs on my Ipod and then play them on the guitar with the help of this book. My favourite is - &#34;While my guitar gently weeps&#34;, a song I have always wanted to play. If you love the Beatles and want to play their songs this book is for you.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I was rooting for the main character to &#34;save&#34; him.  I learned a lot about spinal injury and how devastating it can be.  Not the ending I had hoped for.
1907523588|5.0|I recommended this book: To the Lighthouse because it shows us a new way to see the life and contemporary world.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This shook me to the core.  I don't think I can see the movie now that I've read the book.  Martel almost paints spectacular vistas with his vivid descriptions.  I will never look at an animal in the same way again.  My favorite book of the year so far.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised with quality & condition.  I am just starting to use Amazon, so far , so good.  Now looking for lighted magnifying mirror.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I liked the main character's teasing us about his guilt or innocence throughout the first half of the novel.  I liked the wife's manufactured diary.  I was not happy with the ending.  A blackmail marriage arrangement.  I grew to despise the wife with a vengeance.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app.It's the best.I downloaded it because I was doing math and it's great.Defiantly get this app it is a good calculator.
B004P29LEU|5.0|This movie is a classic in my mind. This shows that love isn't just for &#34;perfect&#34; people. Everyone deserves to find love and this story shows it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|As always, Ken Follett comes through again with a wonderful story.  It was full of details and interesting storylines.  Can't wait to read Book Two.
1401941893|5.0|great book for those who like autobiography and love fashion. i would reccomend this book to everyone just to read it and enjoy the life of one of the famous models in the world
0385523394|1.0|Repetitive, poorly written, unmoving, flippant. This book has no substance and I regret buying it. I do enjoy the tv series though (and this is the first time I've ever chosen the on-screen adaption of a book, over the book!)
0061537969|5.0|I am an avid reader, read all sorts of books.  This book is outstanding and a keeper.  I can't want to tell friends about how much I 4njoyed it.  Frequently, the ending of the oook is not what I expected.  This ending was perfect, nothing I could have anticipated.<br />Critical events in the story with sensitivity and realiek;
B00821PCJS|5.0|Fairly entertaining for a TV series.  A nice mix of action and drama.  Always enjoy watching it commercial free on Amazon Instant Video.
B008469DGY|4.0|This isn't golf so much as a driving game, almost like a homerun derby but with golf.  It's alright, but I'm glad I got it for free.
B00EGIBHEA|5.0|THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE is a very good John Ford Western, which is untypical of Ford in many ways. It has a claustrophobic feel about it and it seems unusual that it was shot in black & white (by William Clothier) in 1962. On one hand John Ford was always concerned with Eastern vs. Western values. Most of Ford's Westerns have always been about bringing law and order to the West in which ultimately progress and not guns achieve that dream for society. Ford's vision of that dream is much darker here. In this film Ford creates a darker dream thus not allowing elements of the dream to expand into the legend. Thus, the visual claustrophobic feel bolsters that idea and reality of an aging and wiser filmmaker.<br /><br />John Wayne quietly underplays his role. James Stewart as the idealistic Eastern lawyer who is robbed on the way West, goes to work in the town of Shinbone as a dishwasher and eventually brings law and order to the West unknowingly through the efforts of Wayne. Lee Marvin as the villainous and evil Liberty Valance is one of Ford's most violent screen incarnations. Edmond O'Brien and Ford veterans Andy Devine, John Carradine and the incomparable Woody Strode are all featured. Set designers Sam Comer and Darrell Silvera did an excellent job on the Shinbone sets, especially O'Brien's newspaper office. John Wayne, Ford's mythological hero, and his performance are for me the cornerstone of this film. As elements of an Eastern based society overtake the untamed West, the old dream comes to a conclusion and with it the mythological hero of that dream must end as well.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|It's super difficult to control sometimes - my fat finger will draw lines that screw up the path, makes me want to get a stylus just so I can play it better.  But that's not the game's fault.  It's really surprising how good this was.
B00004RFFS|4.0|I'll confess that I went through an Anne Rice phase many years ago, it started of course with the first novel 'Interview with a Vampire', while many might blame her for the current trend of turning them into teen romances, at least she kept them as monsters. Charming monsters perhaps, but still monsters.<br /><br />As with the book the film tells of Louis, a grieving and morose landowner from New Orleans centuries ago turned into a vampire by Lestat, it then tells the story of his life over the centuries. Brad Pitt does a reasonable job of the ever miserable Louis, as in Meet Joe Black he plays the urbane monster well.<br /><br />Tom Cruise wouldn't have been my first choice to play Lestat, he lacks the stature for starters. However he does play the role well and gets across the devilish fun of the character. There's a few other well known names dotted throughout the film. I think it's fair to say that they all ham it up a bit with their performances, but in context it works.<br /><br />In parts beautiful, in parts horrific, this is a decent vampire film and a lot of fun to watch.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|What more can possibly be said about Bob Dylan?  The most timeless artists are fully of their time.  That is certainly true of B.D.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|who would have thought these headsets would be so good?I didn't i thought they would be unconformable but i was wrong these are very good and are very resilient,i stepped on mine and nothing happen,if you want a cheap all around headset then get this one!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show is surprisingly amazing and for me competes with shows hbo, showtime, etc.... Great storyline and great content. Harvey Specter!!!!!!!!!
B00DQBWLSO|2.0|Up to this point I have loved everything Mayer has done. Even Born and Raised which was folksy yes, and captured the Neil Young 70's style, but this record is just plain awful in my opinion.<br /><br />Do I want Mayer to be predictable and sound like what I expect from him? No. I thought Born and Raised was a nice departure and was really well crafted. However, I am definitely not a fan of country music and that's what this is.. Country. It stinks and I won't be working in into my Mayer queue.<br /><br />I also think many of the songs are just too lazy...lyrics, melody, etc. I find it all sub-par. I really don't understand why so many are quick to defend this record. It certainly won't get much airplay and sure to disappoint the younger crowd as well. I'm 50 and I can't appreciate it. Can't imagine why anyone that's not a fan of country would like it either.<br /><br />Just my opinion... I say don't bother.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|It took me awhile to believe my friend that I NEEDED to start watching Downton; once I started I couldn't stop!  I can't wait for the newest season to start!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Really good game for 3 or 4.  Always a different scenario and makes you think while having fun.  Amazing when the 6 and 7 year olds figure out the strategy and play on an even level with the adults.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Normally I look for a game that is both hidden object and adventure genre. This game is, however, very entertaining and exercises you mind and vision.
B00005N6KG|5.0|simple, cheap, great sound. buyers be warned, this earphone doesn't produce a lot of bass, but it is to my pleasure so it is good for me.<br /><br />I use this earphone for the surround sound, quality of the headphones is rather cheap. they don't make em like they did before...
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|Sorry but I've had nothing but trouble with my Kindle Fire HD and the camera option.  Maybe I'm just too old to figure it all out... but never the less there are better apps for the kindle than this camera one.
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|one of my all time favorite movie. the transfer to hd is great, but some scenes needs work. over all the quality was pleasing.
B0033AI41G|5.0|Amazing, stunningly beautiful telling of Dr. John Nash' life story.  This brilliant man, so sensitive of mind and spirit...truly an inspiration.  Highly recommend.  Should be required viewing in every U.S. high school.
1416550550|5.0|This was a great story , from beginning to end. I found it very hard to put down, when it was time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was very touching...can't wait to see the movie! Excellent read for a young adult as well as the older generations!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After the first three chapters you'll think, \\"that was a great story\\". Twenty chapters later you'll wonder how you could possibly be so far from there and still so intrigued about where the story could possibly go.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Found myself unable to set my kindle down til I finished.  Great read. Painted vivid pictures of one's suffering and hope.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i can't get enough of this game!!!  it is very challenging ! can't wait for more &quot; rooms&quot; to open up! :)
B008RA3X5E|1.0|My kindle did not come with the correct time set, and I cannot correct the time or day on the clock. I can set the alarm, program music etc. but none of that helps when the settings don't include setting the correct time to begin with.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I just watched this movie recently, having avoided it due to some negative reviews online.  Big mistake!  The plot is crisp and simple, the movie is designed to put you in an immersive dystopian future and generate as much action and carnage as possible.  There are no divergent side-plots, obtrusive comic relief or useless characters.  Very highly recommended to anyone who enjoys this type of fiction.<br /><br />I don't even own a blu-ray player and just bought the blu-ray for when I do (also to send a message to anyone who may be watching that I will readily support a sequel).
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is way better than most bingo games--I love how you can win all sorts of things--being able to compete against other players feels like you are at a real bingo hall but without the smoke and noise and even if I lose--I feel good that I did not lose real money.
1250029465|5.0|I just finished this book this evening on my commute home.  I absolutely loved it and didn't want it to end.  James Bowen, thank you so much for sharing your story with the world.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love it! I like that it has several puzzles, not just memorization or matching but problem solving. Great game to exercise the brain.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Although this has flaws and Abrams took some liberties that ruffle the feathers of longtime fans, the acting and action are enough to keep the viewer interested.  The actors do such a good job of trying to be younger versions of their predecessors, and I appreciate that.  The plot could have been better if written by someone who actually likes TOS and grew up with it, but this movie makes for a fun evening at home.  There are a few seriously awesome lines that make it worth watching again.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I absolutely loved it.It deserves every award. I couldn't sto<br />p reading.I love this whole thing it's just woke I never thought I would like this.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|The grandsons absolutely LOVE the T-Rex diorama packaging, and of course all of the adults love the movies !!! 1 & 3 are our favorites; 2 lacked some of the heart found in the original & final sequel. Worth every penny.
B008Y76VW2|5.0|Great cast of characters and smart dialog make this one of the better coming of age stories in a long time.  There are some wonderful and hilarious roles from the the supporting cast, including those by Kristin Wiig and  Bill Hader - the owners of the Adventureland theme park.  Kudos also to Eisenberg's and Stewart's characters who have a great chemistry together.
0439813786|5.0|In \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret,\\" author Brian Selznick cleverly weaves together the non-fictional story of French illusionist/filmmaker Georges Melies and his collection of automaton with the fictional story of Hugo Cabret, a young boy living in a Paris train station in the 1930's who finds a broken automaton. Although the book is over 500 pages long, once beginning, the reader will enter into a new world not just through words but also through story moving illustrations. What I love most about the book is the author's talented ability to seamlessly blend these two stories together; making it interestingly puzzling where the fiction ends and begins. The story follows Hugo on his journey to repair the automaton and answer the many questions his attempts to repairing it bring. Reader's will quickly become one with Hugo's curiosity and fascination with the automaton as well as the history it harbors, nervously searching for answers as if they were Hugo. It is very impressive how Selzinck manages to blend together the different stories of each of the characters we are introduced to, becoming invested in everyone's overlapping relations and their role in the overall plot. The story of Hugo, the automaton, and all of the people he meet along the way truly inspires readers to never stop searching for answers and to hold to dreams, no matter how out of reach they may seem. Overall, \\"The Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" is a great story that readers of all ages will not only be able to relate to, but will also enjoy.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|This is nothing like the Stalone version from a decade or two back. It's grim with little to no sense of humor (I miss that). But it's not a bad movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|You wil become emotionally involved in this one....anger, disbelief, surprise & disgust. This is an entertaining read, not a literary gem. Plenty of ups, downs & all arounds! Like most others, I didn't like the end.....
B008IJT0CE|3.0|I can't speak about all of the sound clips. I found the ones that worked for me with in the first few items. they help me relax enough to fall asleep in a shorter period of time than before.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I like this movie a lot.  The effects are way better than the original, but it still has the same great moral message of the original.  Fun, fantasy movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Love love love this book! I can't stop reading it! It's just too good! Definitely worth the purchase everyone! Promise!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would give it more stars if I could. I had never watched any of the series before and now I'm hooked
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My grandson plays it on my new Kindle Fire HD (which I love)!!  He is 3 years old and learned how to play it with no effort.  He showed me the ropes!!  I only let him play for a short period at a time, but I would recommend it.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Very good exiting couldn't put it down. A page turner look forward to reading his<br /> Next book  inferno..I will buy it next.
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|To must profanity for me, so I didn't finish watching the movie. That information would be beneficial in the description
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|great time passer! puzzles are fun and challenging. I have not had to spend any money in this game to advance levels.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|The picture quality was not good and it kept buffering .  I had to stop and star it several times.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very good alarm clock.<br />Gets the job done, Wakes me up, Listen to my music.<br />It's also nice to see the weather reports on it as well.
B0019FWIEQ|4.0|I liked it very much good movie . I would recommend this to all of the people that I know.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|I purchased this item for my son,so far he said its work good and its comfortable for playing his games and so forth.
B00DURILJ2|3.0|It is an o. K. Movie.  It actually turned out better than I thought it would. Loved the southern scenery
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I love this show and every single season. I just started re-watching all seasons and started from here for some reason. Regardless it's a fantastic, well written, entertaining program. It's a perfect bro-show and helps escape life's little troubles 45 mins at a time.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Great book on the thought process behind the communist mind set. A country stuck in in the past with no hope for the future
B000OCXI3K|5.0|I'm a HUGE fan of La Binoche and the movie, but the book trumps it. Joanne Harris is an awesome writer.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is the Dredd that should of always been. Hopefully thanks to Dredd Day they will recognize the large fan base this movie has and green light the sequel. For a movie that has a pretty depressing storyline I can't help bunch watch it over. Karl Urban does a superb job at portraying the emotionless \\"Hero\\". The visual effects were without flaws and it surprised me more than a few times. If you love action movies or Judge Dredd then I don't know how you can't have this in your collection.
B00DYXBAMC|5.0|Zendaya shines. There is not one bad song on the whole cd. Another amazing Disney girl. Thank you Zendaya. :)
B002KLOPF8|5.0|This must be the 10th time I've seen this training sequence with Gunnery SGT Hartman.  It is still entertaining, and would be to anyone that went  through boot.  All of those canned cadences about Ho Chi Min, Marine Corps, the foot locker inspection, and the rifle prayer brings back memories.  It wasn't fun experiencing it, but it is fun to watch other people suffering through it.
1843794055|5.0|great recording, amazing reading, no scratches, complete 10 cds, the only problem:  &#34;K&#34; is pronounced &#34;Car&#34; by the reader!  bizarre!  otherwise, amazing and worth every penny for K's endless search for fulfillment, which never ends...
B00F35BV64|5.0|It seems that the universe contains a never ending supply of bad guys for the Star Trek crew to battle.  The Roddenberry technique and effects are intact with this film.  It is highly entertaining, which is the reason we go to the movies in the first place.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Video quality is fantastic. It is easy to connect your phone to the Chromecast after you watch a tutorial.<br /><br />Seems to automatically shift bitrates to minimize buffering. Sound quality is also good.<br /><br />The only drawback is casting frome Chrome browser on PC to Chromcast. The video and sound is great quality, but not able to go fullscreen unless the PC is fullscreen also. Kind of defeats the purpose of casting a tab. Basically it acts like a second monitor, needs work.<br /><br />Would buy again.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Great product. Came to me just as described. I Would recommend to anyone looking to buy a playstation memory card.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|I'm an X-Men fan.  Love it! I have all 1-3, I will have to get the rest of them. Love it!
0920668372|3.0|Read the book to my children when they were little. Have always make it a gift to buy for new parents. But the print in this book is sub-standard.
B00EEN66SY|3.0|This is a well done movie about a true story that was completely made fun of my the entertainment industry. Miss Coppola developed a great story from a magazine article and filled in the blanks. It's well acted by Emma Watson and truly a fun, light, movie to watch. LOTS of couture to see. :)
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I am a list maker. I have previously made lists on paper and tend to misplace them. I downloaded this app to my kindle fire and use it all the time. I make my shopping lists on it. You don't need wifi access to use it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE IT .IT IS SO COOL RIGHT.  Sorry about the caps.  You should buy it because I love it soooooooooooo much.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|If you're a fan of the movies, you'll like this game. There's really no skill involved, and it's mostly just waiting for your dinosaurs to be &#34;ready.&#34; Sometimes it gets a little boring, otherwise I would've given it 5 stars.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|It is an engaging film.  The director, artists and film employees did a good job I believe.  The next time I watch Goodfellas I am sure I will see others ways the film depicts different perspectives of the gangster lifestyle and the lives it impacts directly or indirectly.  The celebration scene of a gangster's release from prison and next scene of the late night unexpected visit to Tommy's parents house she told Jimmy &#34; I'm so happy to see him.&#34;  and with both events Tommy was cordial in supposedly upbeat moments in his defining life.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved this book<br />I really like all the breathtaking moments<br />I have never like an author more then Rick Riordan
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Best movie we've seen all year!  Part coming of age story, part romantic drama - Mud has an aura of magical realism that saves it from the cliches of most films dealing with the same themes.
B00000K0EA|5.0|I bought this for my husband...haven't watched it yet because he has already seen most of them. It was bought to help comlete the Bond series.
B009C7ZQM4|2.0|Although this app did what it said it would, I had to immediately uninstall it. This had made my kindle almost completely unusable. Once I uninstalled my kindle was fine. The other thing that I didn't like was that the app wouldn't uninstall until you responded to their request for a review.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|I bought the Gerber to replace a Leatherman non-locking tool.<br />While a little smaller, it has all the tools and will do just fine.<br />I did put a sharper edge in the blade. All blades appear sturdy, thought I have not used them all.<br />If your going to get one, just ensure that the smaller size meets your needs.<br />It's quality is what I expected.  I would buy another one if need be.<br />.
B00CZAYL76|5.0|Pay the extra money and get the 2CD Deluxe set.  Just like their previous albums the additional content is worth the purchase.  This one will stay in my car's CD player for quite some time.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The music was amazing and was what I was looking for - planning an event and the music fits perfectly -Thank you
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The research and details that the author has conducted are quite interesting. I have enjoyed reading the narrative of these events.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is easy to you. It's format is user friendly and allows those not use to social media explore the world around them
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Simple & great game that I love playing to pass the time. Recommend it for everyone. I've had it for a couple days and haven't had one problem. Can't beat free either! :)
B000B589JI|2.0|The whole point of a canister is to keep whatever you are trying to contain inside.  This thing leaks like a screen door on a submarine.  The concept is cool but the functionality is not there.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|On world 3-2 as soon as the level starts you fall through the ground and die. I have deleted and downloaded it several times. It's a shame because other than that the game is fantastic.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Raising boys in the 70s our family was caught up in the Star Trek craze, but never really enjoyed the following adaptations of the series. We were not disappointed in this however. My husband and I went to the theater to see this movie and enjoyed it tremendously. Be sure to see the first movie though, it will help in keeping the characters and storyline straight. Had to add both to my DVD collection.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a awesome book and I was captured in it. It was a tragedy that Pi didn't see his parents when he fell<br />In the boat. I still love this book!!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie was bought to complete the Bond Collection box offer. I was pleased to see that in the collection that I bought for one of my sons as a gift, there was also a place to add this new movie to the set. He has since enjoyed these movies over and over again.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's very clear and easy for me to use. A five year old could use this it's so easy. But it's very detailed and it's at the tip of my finger. Great! &#60;3
B002M9WW30|5.0|I have bought these as a gift for one of my sons for Christmas. He had all the movies in VHS, but was wanting them in DVD. Of course, he was born in the 70s and followed each and ever one that was put out. There will be a smile on his face when he opens this....that is, if he doesn't read this review.
0486236951|2.0|Same again with this book not enough stitching in book more like finished projects, not happy with this one either, I am looking for demonstrated stitches
B00AFROVQC|3.0|As a story, it's compelling, I do want to keep reading to learn what everything means, and see where it all goes.  I love a story line where the hero is growing up and learning that there is something truly special and different about him and there's a reason he's felt he has never belonged.  However, the writing is not only repetitive, there's an inattention to detail that's distracting.  The greatest example would be between the protracted scene where Thor wakes up with his first hangover from the king's feast, and several pages later, is taken to a tavern and teased mercilessly about this being his first taste of ale.  When something like that happens, I have to flip back to see if I'm remembering it incorrectly.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|are we supposed to know by ESP how to play these games? Please don't answer  I don't want tips or guidelines now.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games movie is very similar to the book and done really well. I've seen it before and decided to watch it on Prime again :) even if you haven't read the book I would watch the movie.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I would like to do more than just use birds in slingshot but it's OK for killing time on the Kindle
B009LGO88E|5.0|The circle pad pro is currently only supported for a handful of games but is absolutely essential in order to get the most out of those games. Highly recommended for those playing Resident Evil Revelations, Shin Megami Tensei IV or Kid Icarus, and probably another couple of games I can't recall off the top of my head. As a piece of hardware it's well- designed. The system fits easily and securely. The battery change compartment is easy to access, the battery life is quite generous (40 hour range based on my experience). It makes the system much more comfortable to hold. The extra space to rest your right thumb is also extremely helpful for virtual console games from the NES and SNES era, even if the right stick is not used in them. The biggest drawback is the extra bulk when storing- with the circle pad pro attached the system may not fit in your case. Though it attaches and detaches very easily you still have to carry it.<br />Ultimately this going to be very useful to a certain, harder-core gamer but it may not be for everyone.
B009RH9HDS|4.0|I like this case for many reasons, but mainly because it protects my Kindle Fire HD so well. I often carry my Kindle in my purse, and it gets bumped and dropped and banged around. This case is more sturdy than other cases I've had. I also watch a lot of videos on my Kindle while cooking, so love love love the rotating stand that allows me to stand my Kindle up on the counter while I cook.<br /><br />One drawback, and thus the reason for my not giving 5 stars. If you play games on your Kindle as I do, you will find this case extremely heavy. It at least doubles the weight of the Kindle, if not more. Holding the Kindle in case to play games results in tiring your wrist and fingers. I assume it would do the same if you hold your Kindle for extended periods of time to read books.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this product, especially for a protection point of view.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was a real page turner!  Lots of twists and turns to the story and I had trouble putting it down.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|This album has all wonderful songs performed by Carole King.  It is as good today as it was way back when!
B008JFUO36|3.0|It had no surprizes in it. It was too tiypical of a Tom Cruise Movie. I do not feel it was worth much.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|love her, her voice and this cd.  Could listen to it over and over any time in the car and home.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|What a reality check, I couldn't put the book down!.  This book was well written and very understandable for the normal person to read how sugar, high carbs are making us all fat.  Growing up in the &#34;low fat&#34; era, I am really open to and am trying to eliminate sugar from my diet and living the low carb lifestyle.  I want to be a good example to the younger generation of my family to eat real food, less sugar to sustain a healthy weight and lifestyle.
B00D6QU6RW|3.0|this is not the backstreet boys I remember growing up with but it was fun for a first listen but probably wont put it back in the player.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The series provides the viewer a human history of the early 20th century. We see the impact of war and sickness and social and cultural upheaval on the various characters we have come to love (or hate as the case may be). We sympathize with lovers and grieve the loss of sons, daughters, and husbands. We are engrossed in romances and allowed to see a world made topsy-turvy by the demands of war and the reforms that were its aftermath.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|Love this party mix cd that is great to drive to when you dont want to listen tot he radio.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am not a big reader and I read this in 4 days. thrilling. will keep you entertained. great twists
1250029465|5.0|I Thought this book was very well written and it would even engage people that aren't animal lovers-  I especially enjoyed this book!  I would reccomend it to anyone especially those who are struggling with emotional issues of any kind-  which we can all relate to at one point or another.<br /><br />  Julie O'Hara
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love this game and its so fun but I wish the stir was cheaper :) best game ever I love it
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|When I started this book, I found Hazel to be too mature and too aware of what was happening to her. Maybe kids who go through trauma are that way. It is the love story of Gus and Hazel. It is sad and heart wrenching. Also, don't read this on public transportation because you will cry and people will stare at you.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This matching game is truly a game of chances and risk.  The people that developed this game must of had all ages in mind, but adults who are young at heart should enjoy playing the many levels that this game offers.  The game begins in a far off country and your travels will help you succeed with happiness and joy as you win.  Have fun!!!!!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Just started and for me this is a new author. It seems at times that I'm reading about characters from novels I read in the past and old story lines, a hiden past, not sure about his liniage.<br />Having said this the characters are likable abs believable, the story line moves at a pace and it has the potential to be a good novel.
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|Can't wait for season II. Great suspense series. So this is politics. Makes you wonder what we get outselves into.
B0044WSF5M|1.0|It was just really long. Some of the scenes should have been cut but it was cool to see the cast and how young they looked.
B0009P66TK|5.0|Durable and lasting. Good. Like it alot. Worth the price for it quality. Old model though but still look trendy and nice
0061336459|5.0|This book surprise me with deep sense of our conscious and subconscious mind.We don't think about it, but is really something to learn more.Wouldn't do you any harm if you read this book and start process with in teaching sense.<br />It could be only for your personal benefit!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was having problems with my Kindle loading it would lock up had to cut off and then retry. Customer Support sent me another cable and plug and the loading is working. Thanks
B00026ZG10|5.0|The movie is excellent. Like the actors and the action.<br />Always like ,when the bad guys are finish in jail or even better, they are dead.
0439023491|5.0|This book is more awesome than the old one cuz you start with knowing nothing about what gonna happen ...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Both my daughter and I love playing this game. Just wish coins acumulated faster while your not playing, but all in all this is a great app
B0000047CX|5.0|Listening to this re-mastered version of the original recording on my higher grade audio system is a great experience. Sound clarity and staging is just perfectly balanced - gives me goose bumps every time. :-)  In my experience not all re-mastered CD's improve things in a significant way but this one certainly does.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Love this PBS series, though I found season 1 and 2 to be the best.  Season 3 was a bit more boring.  Looking forward to the upcoming season.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Very good book.  Now that should be required reading in high school.  Author took full responsibility for her actions and at the same time gave us a disturbing look into our legal and prison systems
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I really enjoyed this story, it had all the things I look for in an epic fantasy, great heros, evil villains and devious kings
B003CFBQBW|3.0|I love the album but there was a tiny crack in my CD case. I did not feel like going through the whole return process though.
B005HW21Y4|5.0|This has got to be the most nerd pun filled book I have ever read. But it is high action and I loved it. I think it may be geared towards the teenage boy demographic but as there is one of those inside me I loved it.
B0029O08WA|3.0|Love the album so much but the album cover was bent and wrinkled. It disappointed me but I did not want to go through the whole return process.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very challenging and fun. got better as it went on. was left wanting. more ....cant wait for the next set of rooms heard its better
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very good game! I love minions and if you do too then its perfect for you too! Its kind of like temple run. But only with the collect coins and jumping over obsticales. I like how you can get new levels.
B0041WZC1A|5.0|So .. I was a huge fan of Bladerunner when it first came out. A couple of years after it was released I was over at a friend's house and I heard this music playing. When I inquired about it and was told it was the soundtrack to Bladerunner I was floored. I didn't realize at that time you could buy soundtracks to movies. So, a few days later I bought my first copy of this soundtrack. This was before Vangelis's version came out. Since that first purchase, I have always had a copy of it. As they wore out, I would replace it. Now, finally, I have an MP3 version.<br /><br />The music itself is has hints of the blues and jazz, it's comforting to me. Forget it if it's raining and I am playing this. I highly recommend owning this copy, even if you're a Vangelis fan. I have both and will switch up depending on my mood.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|A beautifully written long, long book where some of the description caused me to flip the pages. I liked the plot, but the main character's angelic character was overdone to become boring. Notwithstanding, my criticism, I think it is worth a five.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|This is Bill Murray at his BEST!  Well, wait a minute....I do need to give lots of credit to the writer and director, I guess!  Andie McDowell tries her best, but this movie belongs to Bill Murray.<br /><br />He is a man trapped in perpetual Ground Hog's Days.  Every morning he wakes up to the same exact song on the alarm-clock radio, the same weather, the same job reporting on the Ground Hog and whether we see his shadow!  The premise is used in the most interesting ways:  at first Murray uses the repetition for evil (robbing banks after getting to know their routines, getting to know Andie's likes and dislikes to try to win her over, but finally uses his time to master the piano, become an expert at ice carving, learn a foreign language).  Love the concept!  And Murray plays his character with ever the so slightest grin to let us all know he is having a blast and letting us in on the joke.  This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again when it comes on cable TV.<br /><br />I'm not spoiling the ending for you, but I highly encourage you to see it for yourself!
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Now this was an excellent book. It was beautifully written and described the characters to life. I would love to read it several times just to learn how to write.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|The book is sad excusing it was the book I would never have thought it was from the cover so you should read it then you will see how great it was.
B00CATSONE|4.0|What a sad story for such a great thinking man. Business is business, but those financiers were hard on Tesla and I daresay, he was born just too soon to enjoy the computer age as we do now.
B00DYVU9K8|5.0|This Coppola production is another out of body experience. Amazing. The characters pop. The story sucks you right in. You can almost hear the sneers for Lohan, Hilton, Miley, and their ilk as you watch them get robbed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Well, I made it to level 10! Had allot of fun trying to figure out the answers to each rooms puzzles. They get harder as you go. Stumped for days at a time in the end rooms. But enjoyed using parts of my brain you don't get to use any more. Except maybe a PC issues to solve at times. Good for your brain. Can't wait for future rooms to solve.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie is great!!, No wonder is an academy film. Great script, super great cast, this is what life is all about.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|BUY THOS APP ITS COOL the Ninja minion goes yarrr then he farts Omb its funny<br />buy this ppm I think its good
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|CAN'T STAND THIS I THOUGHT IT WAS THE GAME AND IT WASN'T IT WAS JUST LEVELS I DELETED IT AS SOON AS I PUT IT ON THERE
B002ZG981E|5.0|loved it.<br />one of the movies that keeps you guessing until the end, then keeps you discussing it after its over.<br />Great cast, and great cinematography.
B00A9T1HUO|1.0|I never get tired of listening and watching Josh perform.  He is an amazing talented singer and performer.  I am watching to see what is coming next from him!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I am part of the more mature crowd and this is one of my favorite games.  I am not really into racing games but this one is so much fun. It was a bit frustrating at first until I learned to do the upgrades. Coins add up fast so the upgrades are easy to earn. The further you go the more coins you earn. I have had a lot of laughs watching the little guys head bobbing back and forth &quot;whiplash&quot; and racing to the next gas can; flying by the seat of the little guys pants. This game is the best.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I will never look at my dog the same again. Sweetness and tears...complex and simple...enlightened and dark...what a wonderful read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Brilliant and touching a must read for hunger games fans it shows the true bravery of the girl on fire
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Bakersfield sound done today. No formula, just success.<br /><br />I used to hate &#34;Hee-Haw&#34; , but this CD grants the Bakersfield sound full absolution.
055358202X|5.0|I'm about half way through and George R. R. Martin is building up for the final volume.- time must elapse for Dany's dragons to grow!  But martin keeps things moving along and is doing character development so that when he kills off a few more characters we'll feel the sting.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|One of the best games I have played in a long time. The clues were easy but not to easy. The game even held my husbands interest. We enjoyed playing together.
B000VSAEYI|2.0|Although I paid $35 for this pool, I still don't like it.  We were only able to use it for a couple months because within the first few uses it got multiple holes.  And I have a 3 year old and a 1 year old, and they are not rough and did not bring sharp edges in to the pool.  Also, my husband had to go to Menards to buy a plug for it because the one that came with the pool did not hold air.  We had to blow it up every 20 minutes.  We will have to buy a more higher quality pool for next summer.  I guess you get what you paid for, however, the $3 pools at walmart that are hard plastic, have lasted 3 years longer than this!  I would not recommend buying this.
1489559396|5.0|This is the story of a young woman, Oria, the Golden Queen, and her quest to free her lost tribal members from a cruel and tragic fate.  Parts are written in the voices of main characters, allowing us insight into their innermost thoughts and rationale behind their behavior.  Then, Ms. Seal weaves each other of these character strands into a beautiful Native American tapestry of love and sacrifice, of nature and beauty.  This was a fast-paced tale of magic, shape-shifting, and time travel, told with beautiful, gentle words and wisdom.  I highly recommend this book.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|I thought I was 10 years old again, watching kung foo theatre with my friends, jumping off of the back of the couch and doing flying kicks, making WA-CHA! sounds and everything.  My teenage children were not as amused, nor as please with my behavior.  I do think they enjoyed the movie as much as I did.  Highly recommend.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I almost didn't watch this because the Stallone movie was so bad. This movie though, felt like Judge Dredd. I have been an avid fan of the comics since the 80's and was so happy to see them vindicated through this film. So good on so many levels. A must have for my collection.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|OMG!!  I held off for 4 seasons before I started watching because I KNEW I would fall in love and get sucked in!!!  I don't know where to start--the actors are FANTASTIC, the costumes and sets are BEAUTIFUL, and the story is FAST PACED and WELL WRITTEN.  Can't wait for Season 4!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The story is told by a teenage girl with cancer and the teenagers she meets in a support group.  I was worried that I wouldn't like the book because they are teenagers and that it would be sappy and sad.  However, it wasn't like that at all.  I feel in love with the characters and although it was a tearjerker, it wasn't sappy.  I highly recommend reading this book, no matter what age you are!
B00F35B8F8|3.0|As a self proclaimed 'trekki&#34;, I was a bit disappointed in this movie.  The content is just OK, but the sound variances were the real problem.  We found that we were continually adjusting the sound level...it was either blasting us out of the room or we couldn't make out what they were saying.  I don't know if that was a production or streaming problem, but it was annoying.  I'm leaning toward the production side on this issue because of when it was blasting and not.
B00DQVST76|5.0|I just received the dvd version the show was great & perfect execution. Even though some people didn't like the editing, sounds, and some flaws but the total show was perfect!!!!!
B000VWGYHU|5.0|Fast and easy download to both my Amazon Cloud Player and to my iTunes library. Great price (only $5!) for a classic rap/hip hop album.
B00005O3VD|5.0|I grew up in the &#34;Barbra&#34; generation.  This woman does everythi8ng in this music.  The soundtrack is very well scored, and Barbra's voice never fails her ability to make us identify with what she sings about throughout this awesome musical.  Omar Sharif is magnificent, and so is Walter Pigeon.  Very entertaining and heart-melting.  What a story!
B000W15AQ6|5.0|I bought this album to have a built in playlist of Eminem's early hits along with special tracks like the duet of Stan with Elton John. Fast download to the Cloud Player and to iTunes.
B00C061I3K|5.0|definitely a must-have for electronic music in 2013, i really enjoy listening to this album, and I think you will too!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Thrilling experience for 80s fans and video game fans through a virtual treasure hunt.  The story is quick and captivating.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Truly everyone is right. Not a huge plot driven film. But they didnt advertise that. No one called it Del Toro's Magnum Opus. But its giant freaking robots fighting giant freaking lizards! Its a beautiful, run film sure to make geeks everywhere smile :)
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|The makers of Wallace and Gromit have done it again!  This is an adorable series the entire family will enjoy.
B009VMN3RA|3.0|Didn't tell me much more than I'd already heard about Shirley MacLaine.  Would also like to know more what the authors life is like now because of her childhood.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I guess I should have lived in a different era.  I love the &#34;simpler&#34; times.  The stories are all at once old-fashioned and current.  The cinematography is breathtaking.  I can't get enough of this show! I was able to catch some of the episodes as they aired on PBS.  I have waited and waited for Netflix to catch up.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, AMAZON PRIME!!!!!
B00000251N|5.0|This is one of those albums that isn't as well known as Neil's other songs...but the music is beautiful.<br />I actually purchased this for my husband who used to have this on cassette--I was so excited to see it on your site as a CD. I didn't think they were producing it any longer!  The quality is great--he was very surprised & happy to get to listen to it again.<br />Neil is the BEST!
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I love this monitor calibrator! I work editing photos and it gives me real color. It's very easy to use and reconfigure the profile of your monitor. Thumbs up!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Another interesting story set in an era I enjoy learning about.  With very interesting characters from England. It is worth taking a look.
B009YQJ322|5.0|This is the Dredd movie I have wanted to see since the early 80s. It's perfect! I saw it three times in the theatre and tried for a fourth, but it had disappeared by then.  The 3-D Slo-Mo scenes were phenomenal and this is one movie where the 3-D actually enhanced the movie instead merely being a marketing tool.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Really good and it was the best game of the kindle fire I have ever played that's the opinion of me
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Kids love it. 3yr. Old and 6yr.  Own the Blu Ray, ordered the online srream  just to have the flexibility to watch it anywhere.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|My kids enjoy this Disney classic, they watch it repeatedly. It is a great movie for all ages to watch.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The Amazon Cloud Player version was immediately available, while I awaited the CD version.  Very good.<br />The music was as I expected it to be from having heard it previously.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Heard various friends raving about this book so HAD to buy it. Found it hard to put down, reasonably well written, excellent story although somewhat far fetched still enjoyed it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I've been playing this game on my desktop for years. This game is just as good and obviously a lot more portable.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|First one of her books that I have read and so enjoyed this book, it was realistic, charming, an excellent read!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|THE GOOD WIFE IS FABULOUS.  ENTERTAINING.  LOVE ALL THE CHARACTERS, EVEN THE BAD ONES.  THANK YOU! MAKES FOR GOOD FRIDAY NIGHTS.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I love it!!! could not have spent a dollar better! ^_^ it is one of the best games cause u make up the board
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I just love this app.  It allows you to put in the possible numbers and then removes the from the row when you add the number in the correct spot.  It has easy through expert levels and is very easy to use.  I use it just about every day.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|It's a fun simple game!! I have a really good time trying to figure out how to beat the level!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This app is difficult to do with just your finger and then no one can guess it.  What a waste of time.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I love this DVD.  I have been following Cher since the 70's and this DVD is almost like being at her performance.
B00C4QLUFM|5.0|A beautiful movue thst never gets old..... S tale of prince charming rescuing cinderella from the clutches of society snd locin her
B000VMFDW2|5.0|One of the best books on the War in the Pacific. E.B.Sledge writes about events that happen to him in a way you feel like your there with him. I have read several books on the Pacific fighting,but none cover the war like this great book. NIKKI R
193700788X|3.0|Reading about my favorite southern telepathic heroine in her series finale was bound to be bitter-sweet, but I never expected to be alternately pleased and confused. No, I wasn't trying to rewrite \\"True Blood\\" in my head either.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Same old humorous \\"Sookie-isms\\"<br />* New intriguing vampire hits the spotlight<br />* Got to see all the characters for a last bow<br />* Loose ends wrapped up better than other series finales<br />* People get their just deserts... mostly<br />* Well-written internal Sookie dialog<br />* Sookie has learned to think first and then act... Finally!<br />* Somebody's pregnant!<br />* Oh, a wedding!<br /><br />Cons:<br />* How many enemies does this chick have!<br />* Low wereanimal/vampire count (of them not acting human)<br />* Why are some passages from the baddies' point-of-view?<br />* Did Sookie always want to sleep with any available male?<br />* Abruptly inserted sex scene seems out-of-place<br />* The choice of rescuers at the end of the book doesn't fit with the series pattern for Sookie<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The plot was well-conceived, but ill-implemented, for a finale of a best-selling series, especially one with a competing television adaptation. I say \\"competing,\\" because \\"True Blood\\" has not followed the Sookie Stackhouse books for some time, inventing characters and plot to suit its needs. Charlaine Harris (or her ghostwriter) had on her hands novels overshadowed by electronic media, but which still needed to be concluded in a satisfactory manner.<br /><br />The biggest failing to \\"Dead Ever After\\" is the tendency of multiple characters to act out-of-character. Sookie is too sexual in her mind about too many people. Friends come from all over to help her in her crisis, but most come up with excuses to leave. Seriously? As if a quick job or other personal reason trumps keeping a friend from dying in the Supe world!<br /><br />I don't like just having the teaser into the \\"last year\\" of the new vampire's life prior to meeting Sookie. Spinoff book or series, anyone?<br /><br />Need more vamplit with Sookie gone?

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|My purchase came the day the film was released and I was very excited to watch it again - such a great movie!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I purchased this mouse after my third Logitech roller ball broke...I guess they couldn't take my gaming...This one thus far is standing up very well to the amount of punishment I put on a gaming mouse...very impressed.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|New features added all the time with upgrades, I find it a fully functional alarm clock easy to program and nice interface.  I use it 7 days a week, program to wake up to the music I chose.  Highly recommended.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent series. I have loved every episode. I think that it gives the viewer a lot to consider about the times that this occurred.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It is a great buy for its price. The app interface to the device is not quite smooth in its operation. Sometimes the app doesn't recognize the device though the device is connected to wifi. Once connected, the app should have save feature so that you don't have to do it over and over again (trying to connect). I guess it a software feature and could be evolving. Right now it does not allow the your music to be played on TV through the app which is discouraging. Hope this feature also can be enabled in the future via software update.<br />Anil
0345803507|5.0|I had to keep reading and didn't want to set the book down. Great trilogy can't wait for the movie!!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|When I first started reading Cornwell's books, especially the Scarpetta series, I couldn't put them down.  Although this is definitely an upswing from her latest books, I feel as if she is pounding out the books simply to make up for her well known financial troubles.  Her main characters, supposedly protagonists, in recent books, have been barely likeable and over the top whiney.  Hopefully she will stay continue to write better books.  I know she has it in her since the first half dozen in this series were great reads.
0345803485|5.0|I found this set curiously interesting. I quickly read through the set. This sure was a page turner! If your thinking about it get it!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book for the ever changing plot that kept my interest. The story line was very creative and well described by the author. I did find ther overuse of the \\"F\\" word a bit overdone and could have been just as interesting with less descriptive curse words.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This app has a very similar feel to a Playstation game. It's challenging and has the cutest graphics. The sounds can get sort of annoying after a few levels, but it does have an option to turn the sounds off and not the music. My 4 year old also loves this one. It's saved me many a grocery shopping trip!
B007X3DQGM|4.0|The pictures are clear, even in my black and white kindle edition. Instructions are clear and tips are very useful.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I kept imagining the movie as I read this!!! I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to others.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|The only thing I would chafe is the Mony  part. that is it. I think this is s very cool way to do it
B0063IH60K|5.0|i love this game and if do to u better vote or i will hunt you down and kill you do i wake myself clear. thank you  so now back to the subject
0525951113|5.0|...but it was recommended by my girlfriend.  She knows Daniel through one of her relatives, and I'm excited about reading it, and from what I've heard about it, it is supposed to be REALLY good!<br /><br />I don't consider this a review, but more or less a shameless promotion.

0618918248|5.0|...this is the book you want to read.  There are probably hundreds of thousands of better reviews than the perfunctory review you read now, so I'll leave you to it.  This is a damn good book, and you should read it.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Martin seems to get lots himself in the vast number of characters and threads he created, so he puts them into somewhat artificial stop or limbo whenever he feels like writing about something else. A vast saga that will never end or bring to any conclusions, a read for life if you want... like reading a history of the world by following  a 100 of &#34;main characters&#34;... forever. No limits to fantasy, anything can happen any moment. While most of the characters seem to follow their &#34;character logic&#34; some of them do not.<br />But... good to get you away from your everyday reality whatever it might be, and keep you in...
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Very good classic movie. The Amazon Prime HD streaming version is no exception and quality was good. Will watch again streaming.
B00E6F155E|5.0|I watched my vhs copy of this concert many times, many years ago. The concert is still as great as I remembered, with minimalist but very expressive lighting and choreography. The blu-ray does justice to it, with great video and sound quality. Including the Youssou N'Dour opening set is a very nice touch. The extra \\"Play\\" DVD makes this a pretty good deal for any Gabriel fan.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Every once in a while math rears it's ugly head. This app is a decent tool to thwart the horrible beast. It has most the basic functions you'll need for calculating tips or just making a quick budget. It can be overly sensitive, but that most touch screens. Still a welcome download to any system.
B00821OX98|5.0|Such a great sci-fi show that only improves during the second season. Great storytelling, with cliffhangers that will keep you coming back for another episode.
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|Everywhere you look, there's a zombie movie. From Zombieland to Warm Bodies, and all the junk in between. World war Z actually is not only worth watching, but rather entertaining. I jumped several times, and that doesn't happen. While there will be no academy awards for this one, Brad Pitt is convincing, and anchors an edge of your seat summer blockbuster. Worth a trip to the theater, or a download for an entertaining night in-
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love it Love it Love it!! This is a relaxing game that is such a contrast to shoot em up kill em games.  I love how you can swim to another game players reef to help them & yourself out with points. The graphics are adorable and fun! Very entertaining, at least to me!
B003SI05PG|4.0|Tim Burtons masterpiece! An absolute must see and must own for any fan of stop motion or animation of any kind. Original and highly entertaining with songs you will sing for the rest of your life. Great movie for the holiday season, from Halloween to Christmas, or any time of year.<br />  2 thumbs way up!!

055357342X|5.0|The books are a must read.  There are many rich elements that are not in the show.  As always, the books are better than the TV show, but....both are excellent.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|I never stick anything on my walls, so I wish this light had an optional stand. Instead, I have to prop it up near my cat's box. So far, it's working.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great show, really brings the characters to life with excellent casting, terrific locations shots and well done screenwriting.  Tyrion steals the show!!!
076115678X|4.0|Her method is too cumbersome to be realistic, but her tips and insights on curly hair are more than worth the price of the book. Unfortunately, she doesn't solve the main issue we curly girls all have - where to get a decent hair cut!
B0093QJY0Y|3.0|Ok movie but not the greatest of all time! It had a twisted ending that left me thinking on the words Rosebud.
B00CQZ65SI|5.0|I liked It because it shows practical tips regarding health and nutrition, and also shows us the intimate life of a great player.<br /><br />Recommended for all ages and public
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|We bought the 2nd movie for my kids first. This is a typical Brendan Fraser movie. Not Oscar worthy, but a my kids love it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Had an expensive SOG pocketknife that was dull as a can be. A few passes on this sharpener and it is like a razor blade.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|i liked the book.  A person has to be ready to make lots of changes in their life and stop lots of bad habits.
B007T99ENE|4.0|Mc Ewan is just a good writer and can put himself easily into the shoes of his young female protagonist and her aspirations, dreams and small M5 world. What makes this book exceptional is the undercurrent of leaving enough openness to make the reader want to explore more of the small worlds of the people in the book.
B00280LYIM|5.0|These books are action packed, and far better than the movies. My children and I love them, even though I think the minimum age for these books is somewhere near 10 years old (or my son just didn't think the books were more important than his sports). Enjoy!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My son has had a hard time keeping pacifiers in his mouth since he was born. I bought this after reading all the positive reviews. It doesn't completely fix the problem, but it helps tremendously. If he is reclined, or in his car seat, it sits on his chest and stays within reach of his mouth so that he has access to it. It has become the only pacifier that he will use!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Great books with an excellent ending. This is the last book in the series, and complete the story line with a dramatic end. If movie producers could just follow the books, I believe that they would end up with awards (the movies have fallen way short of anything tremendous - my son actually got bored during the second movie). These books are definitely worth reading at any age.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|A wonderful melodramatic show. Great cast and lovely English scenery. David Tennant is exceptional.  Close captioning helps with some of the Britishisms.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Helps with day to day weather and storms including alerts.  It is a great App.  I use it all of the time.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Just learning to do theses and love the step by step instructions. Thanks for the book can't wait to read the next one.
B004OZOTSQ|1.0|I dislike this app b/c it states that it will give info and even when it says you have a strong signal, you may not have any signal strength.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|An all around good movie as movies go, quite enjoyable and a movie that you can watch many times over.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Well written and has no the missing bits on HOW TO so I recommend it to everyone who even thinks about getting it.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I first watched Sergeant York on television as a teen in the early 1960s. Since then I have watched it at least twenty times and have never tired of it (despite the fact that I have considerable parts of the dialog memorized). Not only is it one of the great Gary Cooper's best performances, but it is a truly inspiring film. Set in the mountains of northeast Tennessee in the Valley of the Three Forks of the Wolf at the start of World War I, the movie portrays Alvin C. York, a hard-drinking, hard-working young mountain man who wants nothing more than to buy a piece of fertile bottom land and also win the hand of his sweetheart, Gracie Williams. York takes any odd job he can get in order to raise the $60 to buy the land (quite a sum in those days), in addition to working the family farm. The day before the payment on the land is due, York, still considerable short, enters a marksman competition in order to win the prize, which is a side of beef. York wins. Unfortunately, the owner of the land, thinking that York had no chance to win, has already sold the land to York's rival. In a fit of rage York sets out to even the score with the man who reneged on the deal. As he rides on horseback, a terrible storm comes up. When a lightning bolt hits feet away from York, he realizes that God is trying to get his attention. He heads for the little country church where his mother and Gracie are worshipping at an evening service. Entering, he goes to the altar and repents of his way of life.<br /><br />York, clearly a transformed man, begins to study the Bible. At about this time the U.S. enters the war. York, convinced that all killing is wrong, registers as a conscientious objector. His request is denied and he is drafted. Although a model soldier, he is treated with suspicion by his superiors because of being a conscientious objector. At the same time he also wins favor because of his excellent marksmanship.<br /><br />Shipping overseas as part of the All-American division, York takes part in the Meuse-Argonne offensive. About one month before the cessation of activities, York singlehandedly kills more than 20 Germans and captures over a hundred more. He is treated as a hero, winning the Congressional Medal of Honor. Once back in the states he wants nothing more than to settle down with Gracie and farm. The movie ends when Gracie leads him by the hand and shows him the home and the piece of bottom land that the State of Tennessee has provided.<br /><br />This is a truly inspiring and heartwarming movie. More about York the man than his wartime accomplishments (the battle scene occupies a relatively few minutes of the entire movie), it presents in a believable fashion the transformation of York as well as the intense struggle he went through before becoming willing to kill in order to prevent greater carnage.<br /><br />Although the broad outline of the movie is accurate, there is also much that is fictionalized. The one thing that York insisted on prior to the making of the movie was that the battle scene be accurately portrayed. However, York's conversion was far more mundane than portrayed in the movie. The entire scene in which he is nearly struck by lightning and has a dramatic conversion in the church is pure fiction. York repented of his hell-raising lifestyle while at home with his mother.<br /><br />If you watch this movie I would also highly recommend you read, \\"Sergeant York: His Life, Legend and Legacy,\\" by John Perry. Not only does this book separate the fact from the fiction in the movie, but it also gives a detailed exposition of York's life after the war, a life which he continued to live according to his Christian principles.takes part in the Meuse-Argonne offensive.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed all three books. Probably a bit too much violence for young children but a good story for older children.
B008602KQI|5.0|When it comes to movie plots, this storyline is anything but a recycled story. Wonderful cinematography, only a couple well-known faces (which is similarly refreshing), and a high production value make this a fun, enjoyable experience worth repeating from time to time!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|To describe this book with one word I would use: potential.  It's the single reason I continued to read this very long winded, often unnecessary and redundant book.  I feel strongly that this `trilogy' would be a much more enjoyable read where they to be shortened and combined into a single novel.<br /><br />In book one we get a few basic facts and some background. Vampire meets witch and thus come together.  For those that call this a romance or love story I cry foul.  From the opinion of one that reads and enjoys those kind of stories I have to state that I felt the relationship was forced and not developed at all.  I did not understand where it came from as there really was no reason for it.  One day they meet, the next they are in love.. it didn't work for me.  Nor did any of the rest of the relationship but it is what it is.<br /><br />So they are together and (while no objections) I still didn't quite get it but they never really came together.. that is to come in other parts of the series I suppose.<br /><br />At any rate - this book and this series has potential.  That being said, it was all I could do to finish book one and all for nothing because nothing really happened!  It took this author two or three chapters to get anything across.. and that's being generous!  To give my own example I'd say that to describe one single dress might take this author 100 pages!  That's exaggerated but I swear it felt that way!<br /><br />So will I read book 2?  If I get bored enough and can't find anything else to read.. there may be a potential chance of it, though highly unlikely.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I enjoyed this series very much.The interactions with the other Olympians are very entertaining and true to character of the Gods.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|Not a lot to say. 20 years after I first read it it is still as enjoyable. Any sci-fi/military reader should have read this book. Powerful and frightening in equal measures.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Loved this show! His sarcasm and brilliance are fantastic. I can't wait for the next season to come out. I feel like next season release is so far from now.
B00CX7OX6U|1.0|I really tried to like this movie and stay with it but I finally turned it off. The acting was awful and it was not one of Affleck's best moments.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|Not a lot of practical application, but fun to fiddle with pictures. Installed it on my Kindle Fire HD. I just wish I knew how to keep the pictures from appearing upside down. I have to rotate them with other software.
B005LAIIN0|2.0|I loved this movie! The reason I went was because it was PG-13. I've seen quite a few rated R zombie movies, but this one (in its PG-13 version) was better! It showed you didn't need lots of blood and swearing and naked bimbo teenagers to make a good, scary zombie movie. Then they went and made the Blu-Ray. I had to do a ton of research because it isn't made plain anywhere. The ONLY place to watch the PG-13 theatrical version is on the 3D Blu-Ray or the DVD. It is not on the standard 2D Blu-Ray at all. Epic fail, Paramount.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|A good starting point and there's no reason a beginning writer shouldn't read this.<br /><br />A better title might have been \\"Using Word to Build Your Book for Kindle\\" as the book is dedicated to producing a Word document that you can upload to KDP. While the resulting ebook will be serviceable, you won't really have the ability to fine tune the end product.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Action packed movie, great performances!  I can not wait foe the next flim.  I highly recommend it: trekie or non trekie.
B00005JN0T|5.0|It is the favorite movie of my husband and myself.  We watch it many times over and over again.  No matter how many times it is watched!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. It had me laughing and crying simultaneously! Very well written! I couldn't put it down.
B00BNXOMHA|5.0|The books are much better, but, if watched awhile after you see the movies, the movies are very good.  Watch them.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I just love this CD!  The songs are old favorites sung by Buck Owens and Merle Haggard years ago.  Vince and Paul do an amazing job. This one gets lots of playing time....in the house, in my car or in my husband's pickup.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|This was a good lesson in jurisprudence, as well as good old- fashioned police work. It was a good, no really good read. I'd love to see the sequel. Read it, and enjoy!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend. He loves this show and it was a great deal for all the season!!!!!!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was slow getting into it, but came together and was a good read.  Makes you wonder about the choices you make in life.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I do not care for a pop up telling me that if I give them a 5 star rating that I will get updates on this app. Here is my rating. 1 star for being annoying. If your product is worth a Damon you wouldn't have to beg for a review!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super addictive and very fast faced fun. I love the graphics, and the minions are hilarious! Can't wait to get to the next level, each one is so unique :)
0743270754|5.0|I like anything about Lincoln. I wanted also to compare it with the movie. It is very well written; Doris Goodwin is always good.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I love this show and season six seems to be even funnier than the previous seasons.  I am very excited for season 7 to start and then will also purchase it, once it comes out on DVD, to complete my collection.
0060254920|5.0|my granddaughters loved this book when they were little so I got copies for their daughters for christmas presents along with all of the Shel Silverstein books
B002M9WW30|5.0|For those who are complaining about quality yes it is not as clear as blue ray movies that were made today, but for movies that were made in the 1900's these are truly remastered for blue ray! Picture is much sharper then regular dvd. I bought this for my fathers birthday and he was completely satisfied with it, i recommend this to any Rocky fan out there :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoy it - watching the interaction between the actors.  It's nice to have some good clean television to watch!
B00DB97LCM|4.0|I am a grown man and have lived with my wife for 30+ years. I also have 2 grown children. I am quite offended by comments about Trek. I have enjoyed Star Trek since I was a kid. I liked all the movies except The Motion Pict. It was slow and boring. Everyone after that was good, some better than others. It must have some faithful followers to produce so many spin offs. Star Trek TOS, STTNG, DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise.<br /><br />Trekkie for Life<br /><br />DK
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great acting and story line for the entire season.  I can't wait to see what happens next season with the reaction to the new law firm being created.
B00EP2PXCY|5.0|Love this song! I feel like dancing everytime I play it:). It reminds me of songs from the 90's, which is refreshing with all of today's junk.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I put this on my kindle for little cousin, it seems every child (or young at heart) really enjoys this.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This is a really great follow up to the Star Trek reboot.  Early on you're left guessing exactly what is playing out and who are really the bad guys.  I think like typical J.J. Abrams there are some things that are a little over the top and you still have some of the camera 'lens flares' but I guess so many people made jokes about them he toned them down quite a bit from the first movie.<br /><br />I'm very happy to have this in my movie collection now.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Pretty good movie overall.  It was enjoyable and fast paced.  Good casting.  Good plot and plot development  and vetry good special effects.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|I bought this after reading Ender's Game and was pretty excited about continuing the Ender trilogy. However, I was not terribly impressed.  The book is based on characters with Portuguese/Italian type heritage and therefore learning a lot of the names and their associated nicknames took a lot of effort.  I will say the ending was quite a tear jerker but getting there took a lot of effort, now I'm a little undecided whether or not to continue on to Xenocide...
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Well cast.  It's fun and entertaining and fast paced.  Good costumes and special effects.  Looking forward to the next segments.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I bought the trilogy because I saw the movie but was somewhat disappointed.  Then I had a bunch of friends tell me the books were so much better because so much was left out of the movies.  I have to agree, the books are so much more informational than the movie, it really presents a much more clear picture of the entire story.  However, that being said I still wasn't totally wowed by the story.  While it was definitely a complete story it is in many ways a sad story, maybe because it portrays humanity in a dark light, which maybe is appropriate in many ways. But on the flipside many wrongs were eventually righted so maybe it's an overall good story taking into account the sacrifices that some had to make to help the larger masses.
B000H7J9QM|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time and my favorite. With the blueray the movie looks and sounds amazing. The price is great I would recommend anyone to buy it or if your looking for a gift for a car enthusiast then look no further.
B001PB3NWK|5.0|great movie! very touching and dialogue hits your soul.<br /><br />this is the 2nd part to Karol and do not skip, you will be losing out!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|the affects done real well. I like the role Brad Pitt played. his character was not one of the tough guy kick butt and take names. his character is smart cool under pressure. that was refreshing. the reason I rate this movie at 3 out of five stars was due to the old movie fall backs. phone ring at the wrong time, kid needs a inhaler, clumsy character nearly gets them killed. things like that. all in all movie was ok.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|I fell in love with the story of Peter and his magical adventure and this is the perfect addition to his tale. These poems are a chance to revisit the places and characters so lovingly crafted in his book Peter: A Darkened Fairytale. In sing-song rhyme, William O'Brien takes us by the hand and leads us through the Shylong Woods, Chantowald, and the Rickety Lodge and introduces us anew to Mr. Twindle Twondle, Hally Tosis, and Myling. He tells us his stories in vivid and beautiful descriptions but this time with rhyme. A must have companion to his lovely fairy tale.
0142002038|5.0|This was the first movie, but it wasn't the first book.  I liked getting a new perspective on the series from this book.  Check it out; you won't be disappointed.
1452000247|5.0|This charming fairy tale is a perfect curl-up for a chilly night with or without a child to read it to. From the first page, the reader wants to step into Peter's shoes and journey with him through the labyrinth of pleasingly odd characters and creatures and the obstacle course of clever passages and rituals. Completely enthralling and difficult to put down, you will not be sorry and will probably find some excuse to find a child to share it with. Very much reminiscent of C.S. Lewis and Lewis Carroll. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in this darkened wood. I can't wait to see what William O'Brien cooks up next! As a fellow author, I find his writing engaging and his imagination boundless.

0553375636|5.0|I really liked this whole series.  I thought that you could identify easily with the characters, and they all had good and believable motivations.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Had the wired version before and loved it. This is the same but with the wireless aspect which is pretty great. Battery doesn't seem to be the best but it is good enough, and I like to have the freedom to get up and move about without taking it off so it is worth it.<br /><br />Definitely the most comfortable headset I have found yet.
0345301455|4.0|I liked this book.  I read it in about 3 to 4 days, which was pretty tough.  The subject matter is not the easiest, and you're presented with a lot of facts.  This is an interesting period, and I'm glad someone like Tuchman did a book on it.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Daniel Craig has played an excellent portrayal of 007. This movie is a little shorter than others, but it remains an awesome action film and a good sequel to Casino Royale. If you went to see Skyfall (the most recent) and skipped this then you're missing out.
B00BXKKNFS|2.0|I don't like the spam they send on facebook about how great an app it is.  I use it on workstation but not on my smartphone.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game. I play it everyday. The only thing I don't like is how it freezes up and when it's back to normal the game ends..they need to work on this asap..besides that I have no complaints. it's a fun game to play my 8 yr old plays too and loves it.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Perfect as for me. But each time I restart my Acer Liquid E2 I need to activate it. Bug ?
B0050DZN4K|5.0|The app is pretty good in that it shows much content from nice sources...<br />I thought it could have not been as good, but it was better than expected.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|There was nothing about this book that I did not like. I could not put it down and cannot wait to start reading more of Jill Saunders novels.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|You can tweet and read tweets easily.  What more can you ask?  Simple and straight forward app that is easy enough to use.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it!!! , the only part I didn't like was the commercial kind of thing at the beginning but other than that it's an awesome game!!!!!!!<br /><br />Thanks for making it!!<br />  Love,<br />  Hailey&lt;3
B00F91H666|1.0|What a horrible movie!  Unless of course you want to watch two hours of running and screaming.  That is all it is.  I have not watched such a bad movie in a long time and I don't think I ever actually paid for such a bad movie before.
B00BFV1I0O|4.0|It followed the other books and was enjoyable. It is certainly a different and enjoyable read. Once you have read one, you have to read the others.
030758836X|5.0|I can't recall another author actually scaring me but she did that.  Extremely disturbing book and well-written.  Kept my attention to the end.
B005IFSSK6|4.0|This was certainly a different angle on such a tale. It was a good read. Flows well from the previous one.
1451695195|3.0|Just those few pages were beneficial to have read.  His journey however helped me to understand why it might be better to keep the (very odd-seeming) details of a near-death experience to oneself.  I have gone silent about my own, that I know was real and very different than his, after reading his account which makes a NDE seem bogus in spite of the fact that I trust his was real also.
0385349947|5.0|This book gives good insight of the issues facing women today and many issues have not changed since the 60's. Great stories from the perspective of Sheryl's life experiences.
0399165274|5.0|I feel I'm being educated by Forsyth's books.  They are well-researched and well-written.  He keeps the plot moving forward and his books are hard to put down.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Loved this version! Even if you think the movie broke away from the classical feel of the 20's, you'll still find that Leonardo was the best choice for Gatsby. The film is a little cartoonish for the first 15-20 minutes but stick with it you'll really enjoy it.
030726999X|5.0|These books were the best books I've ever read.  The books themselves were even better than the movies, whether they were Swedish or American.
B0098XY5VK|5.0|Hot Dog Bush is such a great game. The intro with Dubya Bush always makes me laugh. Its truly patriotic with the catchy music. Lol. I also love the different patrons that visit the stand and the New York scenes. Can't wait till you add Hot Dog Bush 2.
0307887448|5.0|It seems that most of the critical reviews missed the point of this book.  It is pure fun.  The plot may be somewhat formulaic and predictable, but the pop culture references brought back so many memories of my youth that it had me smiling the entire time.  I would love to see more from Mr. Cline.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|Dissappointment to say the least. I was so hoping for a better sequel. Maybe the third one will do it justice.
1476733953|5.0|It almost seems pointless to review this book because I am only echoing what the majority of other reviews have already said.  That being said, it would have been criminal not to comment about such a great series and terrific author.  Loved it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a complex story of a country we have heard on the news for years now but it portrays a view of the culture and history of the type of people  who live there.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This is a fun movie, with great acting and lots of action and adventure.  The Original Star Trek series was a good starting point for the Star Trek franchise, but these &#34;reboots&#34; breath some new life into the old classics.  Love it!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Recommended by owner of Women of Substance in Damariscotra, Maine. Read while vacationing in Booth Bay. Intend to begin when returning home by throwing out all wheat related products and shopping in the vegetable, nut aisle of markets in Tucson.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great Bingo App, the best I've found so far that is available to me on my Kindle Fire HD.  It is a lot of fun and highly addictive, plus there are a ton of slot games you can play when you are out of bingo credits for the day.  And best of all, you don't have to pay a cent if you don't want to.  This game can be completely free and still be fun to play.  Bingo is one of my favorite games to play and Bingo Blitz is my favorite bingo game to play.  Kudos to Buffalo Studios, you've made a great game.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|All suggestions made by Aslan have been made and dismissed before; popularity of the book has to be because of Christological ignorance.  See many books by John Shelby Spong, Marcus Borg, and others.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|A very fun and entertaining movie with excellent acting and great special effects.  Leo does a great job here, as do the other actors and actresses  Could watch this movie over and over.
B003XT60KO|5.0|Should be required reading across the United States.  We would at least begin to be able to have informed conversations regarding economic policies rather than the utter nonsense we have to listen to today.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|RED is a very funny movie full of great acting and lots of action.  Some of my favorite actors all come together for a great time in this movie.  Love it.
B00E1LT41K|4.0|Say what you will, it is a good depiction of the War of the Roses, and, most importantly, it is historically accurate, as opposed to \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and the first installment of \\"The Tudors\\". Also, as opposed to the just mentioned movies, the casting is excellent. Elizabeth Woodville is beautiful, King Edward IV is tall, Richard III is short with dark hair, the Duke of Clarence is good looking and greedy, etc., and David Oakes does a fantastic job playing the latter character. The one miscast person so far, in my opinion, is the young Prince of Wales who gets killed at Tewkesbury.<br />The witchcraft thing is definitely overdone, even more so than in the first 3 books of the series. According to history, Jaqcuetta Woodville was accused of witchcraft twice, and had to defend herself against the accusations. She must have done so ably, as she was never convicted and died of an unspecified disease when she was in her late 50's.<br />I wished there had been more outdoor shots, as in The Tudors, which had beautiful outdoor scenery and lighting. Here, it seems various people ride through the same woods constantly, or towards the same castle. But that is the only beef I have. If you like the War of the Roses, you will enjoy this series. I do and I will buy it once it becomes available for purchase.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Largely riveting read of one woman,s double journey down the Pct and to herself. In some ways like A Pearl in the Storm, only drier.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I missed seeing the series on TV, but I heard so much about it that I wanted to see it for myself and I was not disappointed.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|Got this set with a miss-cut Phillips bit and sent and email to iFixit. They promptly sent me a replacement bit.<br /><br />Can't ask for better service than that!
B00F3C0GSG|4.0|Though not a fan of the cover, this Target exclusive adds the trailers, PLUS about 6 more featurettes than other releases.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|I loved the colors and the sounds on this jumperoo.  I have to say unfortunately that it did not adjust short enough for my granddaughter is extremely healthy but does not weigh enough to be able to touch the floor.  I am keeping it in hopes that even after she is walking they will be able to get her to use this to jump in if she can then touch the floor.
B00CTT9646|4.0|I pre-ordered this primarily for the phaser to go with my STID costume.  The 3D Blu-ray is the same as in other stores.  I bought the Target exclusive that has trailers and about 6 more featurettes, and sold the 3D one in this set to a friend.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Great BookI found this book surprisingly interesting and thoughtful.  Knowing england it was interesting to trace his progress. I would read more by this author.
B009K0OL06|5.0|the show is outstanding, sit on the edge of your seat, love Emily and Jack together  cant wait for new series !!
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Good Storyline and that mountain scene was very good! Like the Snake Eyes character! Good physical stunts of course Dwayne<br />Johnson is perfect for such roles!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great and its beginning to get a lot of the objects that the computer and xbox have. I just suggest that Amazon updates the pictures and description  for this game because at first glance it looks very behind what it currently is great game thanks Mojang and Amazon.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|Overall good game. The control is not great having to tilt device up or down for speed.  Steerings twitchy.  Graphics and concept is great.
B004JK61K0|3.0|I started out really liking this program.  But ever since the last upgrade, I keep getting a message saying, &#34;K9 Mail not responding.&#34;  So I shut it down.  Even though I tap the Empty Trash file, I still have bunches of deleted mail in the trash.  Lately, I can't even down load the mail, can't open it, and frequently can't reply.  Not happy with it right now.
0141345659|4.0|A lovely book written with wit and grace. The opportunity to experience the feelings of those who know they are running out of time.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|One of my favorite shows and now I have all of the seasons. I do not have anything bad to say about it. Great for any PLL fan!
0345358945|5.0|My dream world has become rich and exciting.  I can WAKE UP in my dream and explore. God my mom reading it now
B00BIR381W|5.0|One of my favorite shows and now I have all of the seasons.  I do not have anything bad to say about it.  Great for any PLL fan!
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|In the current crop of jazz singers for me it's rare that a singer can dig this deep. Patricia Barber and Cassandra Wilson come immediately to mind as singers that challenge & move jazz forward with the talent and skill to create musical landscapes that draw you into their world. Backed by a strong group of musicians Cecile McLorin Salvant has cracked that rare air of incredible talent & skill. Her voice is amazing, the control over her instrument profound. As you listen to this album, of course the great jazz singers come to mind; she is influenced by them but she has cut her own path here and while the nod to the past is present this singer has launched straight into the future of jazz.. Highly recommended!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it on my Kindle Fire!  It is much more convenient to play on the Kindle that on a computer at a desk or on a phone which is too small.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|entertaining thriller beyond belief.  would highly recommend dexter to anyone who likes action or thrillers.  caution, becomes very addictive, however!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This  was  purchased  as a  birthday  gift.  I  am  told  it  is a very  good  album.  Give  it a  listen.
B004SH40BQ|2.0|While it worked it was excellent.  Unfortunately, that was just long enough to get past the return time policy.  It simply stopped broadcasting on one channel.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|very well structured and robust song.  true genius.  I can't wait to hear the rest of Gagas New album in Nov.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Looking for something to do at the DMV for 4+ hours?  This could fill the bill nicely.  Has saved my sanity a few times.
0425210480|5.0|As with all of Clive Cussler's books I have read, it did not let me down. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and hated putting it down. Co-writer, Paul Kemprecos, did an excellent job.
B000FBJHZS|3.0|Dan Brown remained true to his usual who-done-it-twist-a-roo story line. Although entertaining, this book was a bit more predictable than his other books.<br /><br />A great vocabulary booster.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I'm working with a laptop with more USB devices than it has ports. I bought this to fix that problem and it does. It is plugged into the computer and presently has three devices plugged into it. Other than than, you wouldn't know it was there--that is what I hoped it would do.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|What a great game...very addicting....I play it every day... It's a quick play which makes it more fun to play everyday.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I like this headset except that the cord is very short. It is frustrating and annoying when I am in the gym
1444737112|5.0|I originally bought 2 copies of this book for two friends whose birthdays were coming up and both love animals, especially cats.  The books were in excellent condition, arrived quickly, and both recipients couldn't have been more pleased with their gifts - one person in particular is about to leave on a long plane trip and is bringing the book to read on the plane.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Great CD.  Great service.  This CD passes the test of time.  Country, country rock, you name this one is a classic that sets the bar!!!
B00F35BV64|3.0|Nothing wrong with a Star Trek Movie. Like pizza, even bad pizza can still be good. Acting was good, effects were good, story was, ???. (Sorry folks, I just did not buy the drama.) My rating of, Buy, Rent again, Recommend, Waste of time, or Nothing. I vote, Nothing.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|If you're looking for spoilers to the show this is not the book to read** However if you're looking for a good quick read into the insight of a female prison this is the book. Piper humanizes these women, and their situations just like the show, but you begin to feel for them even though they're in prison. Then end leaves you somewhat feeling like there should be more, but such is life.
B00EEN7CAK|2.0|I usually have a strong reaction to Sofia Coppola, a strong favorable reaction. This piece of work is just that. A piece of work.<br />It has the hallmarks of Coppola-the dewy youth embracing lighting, danceable soundtrack, Kirsten Dunst. And those things truly are the positives. The story is never really told, if I had not read a few US Weekly's I would have no idea what I was watching. I would think it was some sort of well lit class project displaying different places one could dance and feel clothes.It is not until the last few minutes when people start talking and the audience meets the characters-too late, I was already bored to death. Maybe I'll watch the Lifetime movie version...could be salacious enough to make me forget this flick.
B00E4ZOQR0|4.0|Great kit, but once my husband put it together, it was a bit smaller than I thought it would be. Still pretty awesome.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I've had this watch 6 months now. Main problem was with the band, it came off while carrying something through a carded hotel entrance, after having harshly bumped against side of door. The watch itself was fine, but one side of the band was completely off. Both the band and spring bars seemed ok and functional, but I decided to replace both inexpensively. I've had absolutely no problems since, and I'm still holding onto the original band, just in case. The watch is very durable, no visible scratches even though I'm fairly active and only very occasionally take the watch off at all, leaving it on my wrist 24/7. Every two months I change the  date because of the 30 and 31 day month difference, after this long period I'll see that the watch will only be off by a couple minutes. Everything is still going great after six months, very pleased with my watch.
B005LAII80|4.0|Let me just say that this may seem like a standard shoot-'em-up frenzy of a movie without a whole ton of originality, but that's totally untrue (and partial basis for this film's poor box office performance).  This is an action/crime heist/comic book film with innovation.  It doesn't just show mindless shootouts with shaky camera and cliched dialogue/plot development in between.  The film is an innovative, artistic approach to the genre, while also providing enough thrilling action sequences and over-the-top gore.  In other words, it's got something for everyone.  See it now if you haven't already (and you probably haven't).
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but not impossible.  It's fun solving each room.  I can't wait for more levels!  My husband even plays this app.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I truly enjoyed the movie. The story line has my interest. Now I need to watch the earlier ones. I was not aware of a series of HALO movies.
B007N85POS|5.0|Love the movie Rio and I love this game, can't put it down.  My 4 year old and I take turns playing the levels.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|Mussel, Vin and characters from previous series. The story line is good and I love the way it ends. Looking forward to the next one.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|action packed /sound 7.1 true HD outstanding! / film effects spectacular! / Into Darkness Rocks! /Just pure fun / A must buy for action fans
B0018OFN2W|5.0|Action, love the driving. The actors enter act well. Not a bad story line. Have seen the series except the last one, can't wait for it to come out.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This booked  Entertaining and would be great for kids to read or for a family to read on the road.
B002LANLDK|5.0|Love the series except Tokyo. If you love action and fast car you will love this movie. Can't wait until number 6 comes out on DVD.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this show, every week I can't wait to watch the new one!  I am very happy Amazon had all of the seasons to watch!
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Love this show!  The writing and acting are both fantastic.  Can't get enough of it!  Every season improves over the previous one.
B008BM9L72|5.0|This book has been reviewed to death. Suffice to say I really really like it. Although as good and unique as I find this book, It was not as tender as Twilight series.
0553386794|5.0|I had watched the show and wanted to read what was missing from the book. I'm hooked on the series now and enjoyed the book very much.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|However, unfortunately we lost it in the store while shopping.  No one turned it in and we were extremely disappointed.  So we bought another.  Love the new one just as much.
0553801473|5.0|I have read all of the books in the series to date and have enjoyed them all. I look forward to the next book when it is available.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|Great book! Gave it to my mother.  Actually, the book is a summer reading choice book for high schoolers. Thanks!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Works great and gives plenty of detailed weather info.  Too bad the radar doesn't go down to the same street level detail that many actual online weather sites give.  Still. that's not a big problem, just a minor suggestion for improvement in te future.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|You mayest or mayest not read this great book. I highly recommend that you choose to do so.<br /><br />Many of the characters are very likeable and the reading goes easy and fine. I'm older than most here and enjoyed the wisdom in this book. I finished it 09/18/2013. Beyond excellent.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|The perfect and simple way to get to your gmail account with a couple of taps on your Kindle HD's screen.  Couldn't be easier.
0345529057|5.0|Awesome collection of novels by the great George RR Martin, both as a standalone set and as a supplement to the television show.
B005K17RU0|2.0|Tries to put too much info on the screen, but does not have the detail on radar that eWeather HD has.
B005VPRETE|5.0|My 5-year old was able to put this together with very little help. She loved it, and I love the skills developed with putting it together. I'm glad there are more feminine designs being made to attract little girls to the world of Lego.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Cleans a lot of garbage and frees up a ton of room.  Lets you close apps running  in the background.  Deletes browsing history which wastes space.  Free up your Kindle Fire Hd's memory.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|This sucks  I love magic but it won't install it won't load all the way  it just says installing DONT GET IT
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I really love your book it fun to read I am only ten and l read this hole thing that was lots of fun thank you.for this fit out a kids one
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I like it but it's kinda hard to get gems and gold is hard to come by. The dragons themselves are cool.
B008Y2X78S|5.0|Fantastic show, lots of gangster action using real name mafia bosses.  Acting is excellent and so is the storyline, it really pulls you into the story.  Its like a historical fiction drama about the area, love it!
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I love this book because it was very exciting. I loved the character the giver because he was very smart and was always giving a lot of cool memories
B00BP29SAA|3.0|My daughter liked this game. She likes just about any of the Dr. Panda games. She will play it as long as I will let her keep my phone.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|I have to say I went into this with all the bad memories of the Stallone Dredd debacle, but was pleasantly surprised. This incarnation was excellent, Karl Urban (Bones in the new Star Trek) played it perfectly and the action was great, every thing you would want from a &#34;actio&#34; movie. I would definitely recommend this film.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Like this movie a lot, and the music is just beautiful and Gerald Butler always nice to see him yumm
B00F2362IE|5.0|BEFORE I thought the game was wack but it is awesome you get to run on top of roofs and fight ninjas and bugs
0399250395|5.0|This is a beautiful book with eye popping pop-ups. Sure to give the children a visual treat. I will use this in a kindergarten class.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|I wanted to do subtle tweaks to my kindle fire for my earbud headphones. First, the bad. The interface should be zoomable or have<br />a choice of sizes. As it is it's an exercise in frustration trying to move the sliders with your pinkie in 1 or 2 dB increments and judge<br />the sound. The Bass Boost and Virtualizer knobs are even worse, I still don't know exactly what physical movement/ / arc it want's to<br />get the knob to turn. Once it's set ( mine was a 2dB cut  at 3 kHz and a 3 dot Bass Boost ) it's super easy to save in memory and name. The best part is the Virtualizer which does a credible job of increasing stereo separation. Even cranked to it's extreme it<br />produces a believeable if exaggerated stereo spread, like you're sitting front row center in a club with the musicians arrayed across<br />the stage. I would recommend saving your settings with the Virtualizer on and cranked up high, you can always shut it off when<br />it becomes intrusive like during newscasts and other mono sources. If they fix the interface size this will be a fantastic tool and I'll<br />increase it to 5 stars.
1594203334|5.0|I enjoyed everything about this book. The idea that some cultures produce more polite and well-behaved children has always interested me and now that I'm pregnant, this book couldn't come at a better time. Druckerman's ability to offer real-life examples and scientific research to back up her statements makes this book all the more interesting. It is so important to me to have a child that is polite, well-behaved, and who lives in the real world. I interview a lot of recent college graduates and am baffled by how many of them have never heard a negative comment or heard the word no. I think all new parents should be forced to read this book to get ideas on how to raise their children to be contributing members of society, instead of the spoiled, self-centered kids that I see on today's playground. My husband is reading the book now and really is enjoying it as well. Highly recommended read!
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I did not know that there was another movie about the Phantom - I have seen the stage production, which was a fantastic experience and I have the movie - so this was a movie that I knew would be a great addition - and I wasn't disappointed - there is something about the Phantom that kind of drew me in...
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My 3 year old daughter wanted this movie so we bought it for her.  She loves it and now wants a bow and arrow. Yikes!
B00CE2G3AS|5.0|I always enjoyed this movie very much.<br />And I'm glad to see it finally come out on Blu-Ray.<br />Thanks to Paramount and Warner Brothers<br />Very good A/V presentation too
B0000CF35A|5.0|First, let's rate the vinyl. It's a 2003 EPIC (Sony) 180 gram remastered, and I give 5 stars. I have the original pressing and it's every bit as good or maybe a touch better. I don't care what Steve Hoffman says, it's a great pressing. From what I gather, if he didn't re-master it, it isn't good. He and all his little sheep followers are a joke at best, agreeing with everything he says. It's fun to read anyways, just google it. I have a good turntable with a really good Line Contact stylus and it makes this 180 gram record sound good! I plan to buy all of these reissues! But, one must remember, all of AC/DC recordings up to Highway to Hell are just so so, none of them sound that great but they are acceptable and still good. I also bought the \\"Let there be Rock\\" and ditto on that one too.<br /><br />As far as the album is concerned, get it. This was the first Bon Scott I took home back in 1981 and Bon is at his best, Belting out the Blues and the Rock from the depths of his lungs. Just listen to the last few verses on \\"Down Payment Blues\\" and you will know what I mean. Just about every track is good on this LP. Besides, you have to own them all with Bon Scott, there are only six!
B00D5YNQMW|5.0|Tis Blu-Ray is terrific.<br />And the fact they did the concert to help out the victims in Japan makes it even better.<br />The A/V presentation is excellent.<br />Thanks Eagle Rock entertainment for this great disc
0399159347|4.0|I love being a member of SheReads book club because I get a chance to read books that I probably wouldn't have picked up. I've been recommending this to a lot of my friends that ask for recommendations because they don't read as much as I do. A lot of my mommy friends are loving it because of the short chapters.  They can put it down and pick it up according to their schedule. Problem is (or is it?) that no one wants to put it down! It's one of those &#34;just one more chapter&#34; sort of books. With three storylines, the first few chapters took me a bit to straighten out all the characters and I found myself asking &#34;How are these storylines going to merge&#34;? I was also impressed that I was equally invested in all the storylines. No slugging through a slow storyline to get to the one I wanted to read.<br />The story centers on Cecilia and her husband.  Cecilia is a Type A mom that stumbles across a letter her husband wrote for her to open in the event of his death. At first she thinks nothing of it and sets it aside. Then her husband's reaction causes her to rethink ignoring the letter. Opening the letter and discovering her husband's secret shakes her world and prompts readers to ask &#34;What would I do?&#34; and &#34;How far would I go to protect my husband?&#34;<br />Some of the previous SheReads selections have not been my cup of tea but this selection is a hit on my list!
B00DJYKFXG|3.0|I am truly very happy with the first 4 discs. The mixing and mastering are superb and bring a whole new life and excitement to these historic shows. The DVD, however, is better suited to a coaster. The ONLY audio options are lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 or 2.0, encoded at 448 kbps/48kHz. It is a true mystery why there is no advanced resolution layer at 24 bits and 96kHz like the astonishing \\"Music From Big Pink\\" and \\"The Last Waltz\\" DVD Audio discs. I am amazed that Bob Clearmountain would even consider having his name attached to this 5.1 mix. They could have hit a home run with the DVD, but decided to bunt. Go figure.....
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|all around a good watch and entertaining enough to rent in hd with a great box of popcorn and a drink
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I approached this software with great skepticism, but after using for several months on my original Google Nexus 7, I can definitely say that it's actually working quite well. Not only has allowed me to keep my caches clean, I noticed a distinct performance improvement as well.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Wonderful version of a classic story.  Yes it's a little long but it holds very true to the book. Great acting and costumes.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's fun. I wish there was a short tutorial but it's easy to figure out. I play it all the time after work.
0345803485|1.0|I would have never read this book had it not been for my boyfriend who bought it for me. I had been put off it by my girlfriends' enthusiastic opinions: since this was just about the only book they had read, I knew in my heart that their reviews could not be relied upon. But my boyfriend gave it to me in the hope that we could read it together, learn something new and exciting and put it into practice during long winter nights ... :-)<br />He could not have been more wrong! We are 40 years old and there is ABSOLUTELY nothing we can learn from this deeply unsatisfying and boring book, apart from the fact that there is no limit to the amount of crap that people are led to buy.<br />I am really at a loss to understand how adult women can drool about this childish gibberish that features a 21-year old girl who has never had sex (not even masturbation, can you believe that), meets an accomplished and beautiful billionaire of 26 (yes, self-made billionaire at 26!), instantly becomes a sex goddess and has mind-blowing multiple orgasms on every page, even on her first time.<br />But my oh my, prince charming is not so charming when it comes to his sexual taste, because he turns out to be a dominator into heavy BDSM, and more than a professional stalker ... something any sane woman should steer well clear of! With such an assumption, one would expect some really kinky and naughty scenes, but these two end up doing just plain sex most of the time, the descriptions of which are repetitive and after a while even annoying for anybody who has had sex at least a few times in their lives.<br />A little spanking here and there is not enough to spice up the unsavoury dish.<br />I am not going to talk about the complete lack of a convincing plot, or about the excess of repeated and unplausible expressions, or about the boring style that seems aimed to a teenaged public, because there are so many great reviews here that are a lot more entertaining than the book itself.<br />If you arean adult and have half a mind to buy this book, read the negative reviews first, they are all true! If you are a teenager ... well, you can try it if you are in for some romance and a few cheap thrills.
B007RFDCQA|3.0|It was okay, kinda cheesy yet entertaining. I just felt really bad for her BFF, though he was a weirdo lol definitely made me crack up in certain parts though!
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|I love this actor he is a great person and a great actor. Love this whole series.This for the younger people who are not aquainted with this. Is a great fun time. A movie that should never be made over by todays actors. So many of the original movies that can not be topped. Movie people are such idiots. Like anyone could do a better job than Robert Redford in the Great gadsby, Or the Rat pack in Ocveans 11. That new vershion sucked. Even my kids and grandkids said the origional one was better.
B0090SI4OC|4.0|I like the message behind the story. Souls are eternal, and even though we humans cannot inhabit other bodies, the idea of living eternally as a soul hits home to me. I also believe in other worlds, And I think often of what else is out there. Just as Stephanie Meyer portrays peace with her &#34;aliens&#34;, I never see other worlds as being hostile, only different. Also, the way her aliens are &#34;beautiful&#34; in their own way, I feel God's creation spans across the board in artistic design no matter what corner of the universe it is in.
B004LWZW24|5.0|Horror movie fans must watch.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Totally captivating, fast paced drama.  Watched the full season practically non-stop with never a dull moment.  Characters you will love or hate!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Awesome good book movie was amazing it makes you think about your life and how there is it's just ... wow
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|Not necessarily any heat between the members of the cast. Can't decide whether this was intended. I thought I would watch this and see how the remake did the story... very compelling...
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I  bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  She loves Downton Abbey and is looking forward to getting season 3!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|My boyfriend took me to see this movie for my birthday in the theater last year and I wasn't too thrilled at the prospect.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised and loved the movie.  It was fast paced, gritty and I loved the dystopian setting.  I thought it was a great action flick.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A great dystopian story...very unique and definitely keeps you swiping your screen. I'll definitely be reading more of Hugh Howey's work!
B008D19WBQ|2.0|I've owned all the Friends DVD box sets for a while now. I was very happy to find out that there were actually extended scenes on the Friends DVDs. When I saw that the BluRay version was coming available, I was more than excited to see Friends in all its HD glory. To my extreme disappointment and border line anger, many jokes, lines, and whole scenes were cut from this BluRay set. True Friends fans would not be happy with this product. I get really pissed every time I notice something has been cut out. And they do cut something out (big or small) out of almost every single episode. No exaggeration. The only reason I can see why they did this was because they want to fit every season on 2 BluRay discs. For shame, Warner Home Video! For shame! The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because I still loves Friends.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|I love the CDS show's, I've bought several DVD and Blu-ray of them and I enjoy all a lot, I recommended
0743297334|5.0|I purchased this as a replacement copy, a druggie stole my other copy. With that, I've been happy with Hemingway and his writing so I was happy to read this again and add it to my collection of Hemingway.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|My nieces and nephews loved this, and that's who I bought for this for. To me, that's all that matters.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|I liked the premise but it seemed rushed, especially at the end. Everything came together pretty lazily to me. The references were fine to me with the understanding that the online worlds were made by someone who obsessed over particular things and didn't necessarily have good taste.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|It fits perfectly!!!!! I am extremely happy with my purchase!!!!!  I have never been unhappy with any purchases that I have made at Amazon.
B009KUWWW0|4.0|World Without End is a very good sequel to Pillars of the Earth. What prevents me from giving it five stars is the beginning, which didn't grip me as fully as 'Pillars'. Where as Pillars grabs you right from the start, making you take sides on certain characters within the first pages, World Without End takes more time to build up the likeability or the dislikeability of the characters. I haven't completed the book yet but I'm a third of the way through and I'm now very interested. If, like me, you find it a little long before finding who to love and who to hate, stick with it and those feelings will come to you.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|This one took a few listens to really love. The last one I thought was just killer so this one I kind of zoned out on at first thinking that \\"The Devil sounds like just a kind of vanilla Alice record. But a few more passes revealed much more depth to me and have kept it in my rotation for a while now
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|In the usual Downton Abbey style, the story line is so unpredictable.  I love everything about this series, from the storyline, to the wonderful cast, and the beautiful  scenery.  Can't wait for the next season to begin.  I have purchased the DVDs, so in the  future I can go back and watch the series again.  it is definitely worth owning this Masterpiece Classic.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so awesome and I love it much I  could play it all day and everyday
B004H51706|5.0|I purchased this for my 2 year old  grandson, He loves it.  The truck is just the right size for him to play with.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|very beautiful and sturdy. The quality is excellent and the price even better. comes with a beautiful box. the downside is the weight, it is very heavy, but still recommend.
B009LQKHIO|2.0|Not amazing, but not the worst I have read either! Kind of jumped around a lot. Moved a little too fast in some places, but too slow in others!
B0018BB20W|5.0|I am a long-time Moodies fan, who switched from vinyl to tape to cd over the years.  I heard that those initial cd's of the first 7 albums that I rushed to get had also been rushed to production, and were not quite up to par.  This is the cd that proved it to me.  My son has always teased me about \\"CHEWSDAY Afternoon\\", which I didn't remember sounding like that in concert.  I can't wait to have him listen to this one, which is clearly the \\"TUESDAY Afternoon\\" I remember.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome character development. Read it for a novel study group as part of a therapy clinic for my kids.  They all want to read the next book! I started... Not sure where it's going so far but it's very well written
B000J3EEBY|5.0|I love Loreena McKennitt's music!  The instruments, the blend of genre, her voice, the feeling of past, present and even future mingling, the unusual celtic meld of east and west, interesting lyrics: it is unique.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This the sequel to Follett's Pillars of the Earth. Great book and as good as 'Pillars'. You must read 'Pillars' first. 'World' picks up two hundred years later and many of the characters are descendants of people in the first book. Both books are very long but I couldn't put either one down.
B00CE0BJQ8|5.0|I was only aware of one Passenger song until a friend mentioned a local concert.  I liked what I heard on samples enough to order the cd and was pleasantly surprised by how MUCH I like this.  He is a poet....a modern Dylan??
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I'm constantly amazed at how well this keyboard is able to predict and correct that which you are trying to write. It's, without doubt, the most valuable app in my smartphone.<br /><br />Personally, I don't use the flow input has I find it to be slower than normal tapping but from what I've seen it is very close (if not better)  than that of Swype.
B003UESJHE|5.0|For people who like documentaries this is a wonderful.  I did not know the king had this problem.  It is great the king found this man who could help.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This is now one of my favourite puzzle games. Shepherding those little grains to the respective cups using your self-devised ramps is a rewarding feat. The relaxing background music also adds to the experience.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Thank you.  I understand and accept myself so much more now.  Wish I had this book 40 years ago........now I know my tendencies are \\"ok\\".
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|From the opening sentence I was hooked.  I wanted to know the secret.  Then when I found out what it was, I could not figure out how the author was going to bring this to a satisfying closure.  I enjoyed the story from beginning to end.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Acting: above average. Nick Nolte on top of his game. Tom Hardy's performance blew me away. My heart was hurting for his character. He is one angry, sad, dark, and hurting individual. Hardy makes you feel it. Five stars for Hardy!<br /><br />The action scenes are good. What i found likeable was even though this was a fight movie, the fight scences did not over take the film. The story goes far deeper than the fighting. We seem two brothers impacted by growing up with a drunk for a father. The ongoing impact is obvious.<br /><br />In order to avoid spoiling the end I will not remark.<br /><br />I highly reccommend this film.
B003KK65KG|3.0|Enjoyable and quite gripping until the end which was a bit unbelievable. I felt the characters were a bit shallow.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Original advertisment stated that you could stream items from the internet, but this is not true.<br />Netflix seems to be the only movie content you can get from the Chromecast.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|It was a little slow at times.  I always enjoy Morgan Freeman and would have loved to see more of him in this movie.  I enjoyed the way it unfolds a layer at a time to the &#34;ahah!&#34; moment toward the end.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Great read! Interesting! Great trilogy to read if you like hunger games and divergent and matched trilogies. Another good distopian trilogy
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great end to a wonderful series. The author did leave you wanting more. My only wish is she would've add more to the epilogue.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Really helpful to both of my daughter's with all their spelling words and any other school work they have each day.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|This was a great movie that closely resembled the book.  It was very entertaining, and though people criticize the anachronistic music, it fits with the spirit of the film while making the time piece more relatable to modern audiences.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i really am enjoying it but i do wish it was easier to play without having to spend money. but for a free game i love it.
B005M92MJ6|5.0|Awesome band. MJK is awesome. If you like tool and A perfect circle you will like this album. Go team!
B009NY43NY|2.0|I didn’t hate the book but at the end I was underwhelmed. After reading all the novels in the series and re-read them to ramp up for the big finally, I was sorely disappointed. I felt the author tried too hard to tie up all the loose ends but at the same time left us hanging at the end.  I feel like the last chapter was just slapped together to make a few bucks. Overall I would not recommend.
B00DQBWLSO|3.0|His departure from his most popular style is interesting but not as strong as previous work.  Relying on directly personal experience, lacks a broader age audience.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I love this  DVD set and always recdomend it to left-wingers.  The music is also fantastic.  I purchased Live 8 when it first came out and had to buy another copy becaused I watched/showed it so often that it was getting worn.
B00CG5MVD6|5.0|Love,  love this movie. It not only highlights Johnny Depps true talent but has a great cast and story as  well. Colorful.
B0093BUVPG|5.0|This album won't disappoint. Go ahead and treat your earholes<br />to the rest of Mr. James' discography as well. Everything this<br />gentleman lends his timeless vocals to is an instant classic.<br /><br />Get with it!
0307277453|5.0|Not that I'm a full hearted believer in Evolution. This book portrays a lot of information about the theory of evolution. Very informational, and somewhat easy read.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Why not just steal a boat instead of all of the trouble of taking one out of a tree?<br />But then there wouldn't be a movie I guess.  :)
0385474547|5.0|This is one I would've never thought about reading until it was assigned in my general literature class. What an amazing book and story. Well written, this book pulls at your heart strings. Recommended reading to all!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is awesome!One of the best kindle game's I'll ever play!Hope they make a three.I love these game and you will to
B003V1WTMM|1.0|Didn't like it enough that I couldn't even finish the book.  Other people that read the book told me they couldn't finish it either.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a AWESOME game for any age group I recommend downloading it to your electronic devices hey hey hey
B0023SDPS6|3.0|Did not like the stupid foul language.  I don't believe that it is necessary to complete the story.<br /><br />Sure do wish they would record these books on CD (omitting the foul language).  I would buy all of them.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Although the game suffers from some grammar and language idiosyncrasies, the puzzles are fun and challenging enough to keep you interested even when the story itself lags. The other version, a school of magic similar to the Harry Potter stories, is equally entertaining. I rate this app high also because they obviously put some thought and effort into the plot and characters to keep the game entertaining for younger players.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I found it too fast for me to keep up with so I decided not to keep it on my tablet so I'm no longer interested in playing the gmae.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|I watched the entire season when it was on TV and was hooked in from minute 1. It's a great show and I pre-ordered it as soon as it ended even though I knew it wouldn't arrive for months.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Since I have put this App on my kindle I have been amazed how awesome this is.  My kindle is so very much faster and actually has a lot more memory. I  surprised how much junk was taking up space that I wasn't even aware of.  I love this and not only for the kindle but also my android!
B0058RCVYS|5.0|Perfectly cast and brilliantly acted, this film does a remarkable job of showing what true compassion looks like. The twists and turns keep this story compelling. There's plenty of eye candy, beginning with Mads Mikkelsen and including the contrasting settings of Mumbai and Copenhagen. I fell in love with each fragile, complicated character. It's one of those movies that warms the soul.
1449410243|5.0|This book is hilarious..so many many parts I read made me laugh out loud at how dead on he is with the way cats act...great for cat lovers
B000K0DU5C|5.0|Amazing book, pioneers tons of ideas that have been used in subsequent sci fi. Many incredible moments in here. Wow. (Recently deposed from most favorite by new fav: Fire Upon the Deep, by Vernor Vinge)
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|This game is soooo addictive. I love playing it because its challenging. I love playing against my friends, family and just about anyone...
B003BW0CB6|5.0|The best with detective Bosch, attorney ballet, Maggie fierce.  Loved all three together. Hoping for another book with all three again.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really like this game. The only thing I don't like is having to buy energy . I have already paid for the game  now I have to.pay for energy and hints . What's up with this?
B009LQKHIO|2.0|I enjoyed the idea of this story, it had great potential. But I couldn't get past how swiftly the relationship between Todd and Megan developed.  If she was just getting out of an abusive relationship, why in the world would she be so accepting of Todd's not so subtle advances. To me he comes accross as more of a predator and I was very uncomfortable with that.  He also seems to have a Dr. Jeckle- Mr. Hyde personality.  To be honest, I haven't finished the book (about 85% complete) I imagine they live happily ever after, but it's just too creepy for me.  I like Megan's easy relationship with Todd's brother better. The other Characters are interesting and the setting makes me want to go there.  I just think Megan's making a big mistake.
B00E25KVLW|4.0|Light style and lots of examples.<br /><br />I have no coding practice before, but I understand what to do.<br />Nice part about Ruby.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I have to admit, I laughed out load at some of the pun humor directed at the old Star Trek fans and yet it would appeal to the newer adventure viewers with the computer graphics and on the edge of you seat adventure.  I really got into the whole Star Trek series after a Sociology class.  This is a &#34;you've come a long way baby&#34; since the original star Trek, and yet it is amazing how much our descendents take on our mannerisms.  I admit it was a bit disconcerting finding a youth acting much like the original cast, but grandchildren and children are like that, as much as they don't want to admit it.  My second watch had me laughing even more after I realized where this was coming from.  So this movie can be enjoyed by both generations for very different reasons.
B00D37UQ1K|3.0|It's an okay movie I guess, but it doesn't do the book justice. I guess it's just because there's so much of the book that's thoughts inside Wanda's head. There's not enough dialogue in the book to integrate it into a movie. Plus, there's so much that the book leaves to the reader's imagination, like the true form of a soul or life on other planets, that it's hard to portray in a movie. Since there's a time limit, they left out a lot of important parts that make the book so amazing. They leave out Wanda's teaching position before going AWOL, her storytelling role in the caves, the soccer game tradition that's upheld, Wes' and Walter's death and how it affected her and the community. They breezed by the original hostility of the community and how hard it was for her to get the community to accept her. They especially left out the distrust that everybody in the community had for her, and how long that distrust held out. They also leave out Kyle's tribune after trying to kill Wanda, and the fight itself left a lot to be desired. They left out the internal battle between Melanie and Wanda and Wanda's supply treks out with Jared and Ian. You don't see the community interact as the family they are and you aren't told about anyone other than the main characters. The format and layout of the cave, along with Jeb's little tricks inside the cave was also very different than of the book. Overall, I just don't think it was the right book to make into movie. For those who just saw the movie and didn't like it, don't lose hope. The book is actually quite good, it's my favorite. In my opinion, it's ten times better than her Twilight saga. My advise is to read the book, you'll get more out of it than you did the movie.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This has a number of good visual cahllenges.  The visuals are clear and attractive.  There's plenty practice at each level; one can move ahead if skilled.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game for hours! I recommend this game for everyone! Also great for kids to play! Coin Dozer rules!
0345803485|5.0|The book starts out good. Once you get into it you are hooked. Great story, makes you hunger for the next book!
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|Awesome movie, got here fast. disk was brand new and packaging was safe and secure.<br /><br />would recommend this to a frined
0345803507|5.0|This turned out to be a great love story, thriller and worth the time to read.Read all three,you will be glad you did.
B00E6M3QLI|5.0|This new live recording is a must for Ry Cooder fans. It's a rollicking romp through Ry's wonderful back catalog (with a couple of more recent numbers thrown in). Ry is joined by old friends Flaco Jimenez, Terry Evans, a Mexican brass band, and a host of other killer artists, including son Joachim who is rock solid on drums. You can read more details about the content in other reviews, I just want to report that the LP version is fantastic. The vinyl is dead quiet, great dynamics, huge sound stage - analogue heaven. Kudos to recording engineer extraordinaire Martin Pradler. As a bonus, the two-LP set includes a copy of the CD. Do yourself a favor and get this great recording on vinyl.
0345803493|5.0|After reading the first one,one cannot wait to get the second and I did have to wait on the third. What a thriller not to mention  the rest of the story.
B00AH6CYRO|5.0|I really enjoy this album, particularly All Nightmare Long and Unforgiven 3.  I wouldn't say its my favorite Metallica album ever, but it is very solid and a must own for rock fans.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you have or have had a dog you will look at him differently after reading this book. Funny, sad and anger are just a few of the many emotions you will experience with this book.<br />Insightfully and well written, I will read this author again.<br />Read it...you will NOT regret it!
B00D2CYU2W|1.0|I cannot believe how the HBO trashed this very<br />talented musician and showman.<br />Have a friend who knew the man and some of his<br />family members, and was vey upset over how<br />they exploit his personal life and not his talent on<br />screen.  Yes, he was gay and died of aids.<br />Still, this could have been made in much more<br />tasteful bio. of his life.<br />This was very disrespectful to a man who is<br />deceased and was know for his showman ship.<br />Money wasted, will not watch again.
B00D0QSZHG|5.0|This is all you really need are books by Joseph Murphy.  They are beautiful, simple, and they leave the nonsense of &#34;The Secret&#34; behind in the dust.
B007IX383I|5.0|Wouldn't give it album of the year but it's close!  I hesitated to purchase this but have really enjoyed the tracks, they have grown on me a lot and this is a solid band with great songwriting and melody.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Wow.  True Love really explains very well just how I feel most of the time.  The whole album is great.
B005LTDPJI|3.0|The cardboard comes apart easily. The artwork is original which is nice but then the bonus tracks aren't listed so you don't know what you're hearing and have to look everything up in the booklet that came with it.
B0038M2RL2|5.0|There's nobody better than Pat Morita!  Much more storyline depth than part 1.  Great values learned from Mr. Miyagi for teens and young adults.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is truly awesome.  The fun just keeps on getting better as you progress through the levels.  This game keeps me occupied for hours.  I strongly recommend downloading and playing it.
B005KQVDH8|3.0|Good movie but don't think its a 80's classic.  I thought my 7 year old would like it but after the first 5 minutes I had second thoughts.  Maybe its a good movie for teens.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a wonderful tool for moving files. It has some other features too, but those aren't well fleshed-out. Still, it does what it says and it does it well.
B005PK57NU|5.0|One of my favorite shows, this season was awesome,an I enjoyed watching.<br />I can't wait to see what they have in store for season four .
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm not a reader but couldn't put book 1 and 2 down, enjoyed all of it and would recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it yet. Can't wait to start book 3.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|New electronics are awesome, I love this new toy, I can't wait till they add more channels to stream from it.<br />Like away to stream your personal videos from your cell phone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I downloaded this game thinking it would be cheesy. Its actually a fun game. I enjoy playing and so do the little ones.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|Helps alot with singing. Very efficient. Love this app sooooo much. Cant wait to keep using it. Really worth purchasing.
B000W93CHC|3.0|Ken Follett writes amazing historical sagas, but I found I was almost dragging myself to my Kindle just to finish them.  And we all want to know how a story turns out, right?
1607053551|5.0|It's a bit daunting if you are a novice at fabric design, but this volume walks you through all of the basics and more.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I think this app is worth getting. It is a fun and enjoyable way to simulate running your own city. I would recommend getting it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game helps me pass the time during the day. I also like the way the objects move around so it keeps you guessing.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This DVD was for a friend and she very much liked the season 1! She would also like to have more so I will purchase more in the future.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fairly simple game that gets more challenging as you complete levels. Good diversity of gameplay mechanics. Good way to help pass the time.
B007SGM084|4.0|Left me a with  few questions but over all good books. I like that fact that they worked  together. And the suspense was good.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I tried to download this game from my cell phone.  the download never completed and I never received the game on my phone.  It was free so no big deal.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Damn; DAMN!  I blame my cousin for buying me the 1st season Blu-ray.  Before I was 4 episodes in, I had to buy seasons 2 & 3, just to be sure that I wouldn't be waiting for them.  It's quite the addictive show.<br />Even though I was really late to the game (I received season 1 in March of 2013), I really prefer to have them on disc.  Between the commentaries, deleted scenes, & many other extras, I feel that I get so much more from the show.  And the Blu-ray versions are just magnificent.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I tried to download this game from my cell phone.  the download never completed and I never got the game on my cell phone.  It was free so not big deal.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I liked this app a lot better before the recent redesign.  The display is cluttered and it runs slowly. Old version was perfect. This is so so.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I tried to download this game from my cell phone.  the download never completed and I never got the game on my cell phone.  It was free so not big deal.
B0068853O6|4.0|I was expecting something closer to Band of Brothers quality with this mini-series, but this didn't quite hit the mark. The characters were interesting, but the episodes weren't always memorable and blended together. Maybe it is a reflect on this units time in Iraq, but I was hoping for more action scenes.
B000MD9UJC|3.0|This product skirts the line in mediocrity. It's not bad but not great either. It's as effect as an upgrade kit as it does indeed do exactly what it says it will. My issues however were with functionality.<br /><br />The button composition is fairly flimsy. It doesn't quite feel secure. That and I suffered an incidence were for some reason the contacts were not seating right thus producing a stuttered light flow or no light at all. Upon inspection I was able to rectify the situation pretty easily but again, the button side of the kit, I feel, could have been constructed better.<br /><br />No complaints on the bulb/light side. A little confusing at first because I didn't read the instructions but one it was properly placed, no complaints whatsoever.
B00CL151G4|5.0|Spoilers: This is not a series for those in need of instant gratification. All 24 episodes culminate in a complete arc in which Joan Watson comes into her own as a detective and Sherlock breaks free of addiction in more ways than one. The platonic friendship between Sherlock and Joan that develops over the course of the first season is the most well developed part of the show.<br /><br />Modernisation of any classic is fraught with pitfalls and Elementary has tried to avoid most of them (to the point of which I suspected the writers of reading TV Tropes). Forensics has advanced since the 1880s and the police are no longer the Peelers of Victorian London. So while Sherlock might have been more observant than the average policeman, in a modern context he would be just a little faster than most forensic investigators at sussing out a crime scene. Watson is a former surgeon and his intellectual equal--she does not let him get away with infantile behaviour and has his back always. Captain Gregson and Detective Bell are competent police officers who get their share of the limelight and back-stories as well (I certainly am hoping for more of Aidan Quinn). Sherlock readily admits that he can be wrong and races to correct his errors. (There seems to be no need for a &#34;Norbury&#34; moment--Joan Watson will still remind him.) The crimes are darker than some of the ones in the original stories and occasionally gave me the chills.<br /><br />There are subtle canon references scattered throughout the series for viewers who like to spot the Holmesian touches, but it was a particular scene in the pilot in which Jonny Lee Miller's Sherlock loses his cool that convinced me that this updated Sherlock embodied the same spirit of a detective who was so passionate about justice and doing the right thing that he jumps up and takes his riding crop to people several times in canon. Lucy Liu provides Joan Watson with just enough acerbic bite and the nuances that make her more than just asounding board or a sidekick. Through Watson, Elementary is welcoming the audience into Sherlock's world and inviting them to follow in the footsteps of a budding detective.<br /><br />While this show is partly a procedural drama, I recall that ACD's Holmes did actually have to do a remarkable amount of legwork for certain cases and long stakeouts with the help of the police sometimes. A number of the cases are definitely flawed and certain episodes were not as good as others, but character development and Sherlock and Joan's dynamic are consistent throughout. Not nearly enough of Alfredo, Ms Hudson and Clyde though.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Always trying to get a higher score because the options are limitless. Could play this game all day! Very enjoyable.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Versatile. Many versions. The audio version is the best I've ever heard, with minimal inflection, so one is able to absorb the words without prejudice
B00004WNHC|5.0|An excellent album in the entire Bob Marley catalog. Quite amazing with all the reggae beats and lyrical writing from Bob Marley. Lyrical writing is one of the best, which contains hope, energy, and optimism.

B0055HVDZY|5.0|The album is a mix of heavy, powerful songs such as Hole in the Sky and Symptom of the Universe, and softer experimental songs such as Supertzar and Am I Going Insane (Radio).

B001DPC4TG|5.0|Van Halen is arguably the best album in Van Halen's entire career. The innovative guitar riffs, picks, and sweeps have garnered Eddie Van Halen a title as one of the most influential shredders in the world. The entire album not only consists of memorable songs, but the meticulous arrangements of musical pieces from what I hear.
B00008BRB5|5.0|The Police is classic.  I can't say anymore I have every CD they have and this was the one I was missing.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|For those who need a good Dramady, this film is comical and yet skirts the issues surrounding racism and oppression in the 1950s.  There is not one weak member of the cast and even though you hate her, the actress playing Hilly captured the essence of a typical 1950s Mississippi woman; and everyone roots for Minie, Aboline, and Skeeter! By far one of the best family films! LOVE IT!
B00AEBBAEK|5.0|This is my daughter's all-time favorite Johnny Depp movie.  She had lost her copy, so we ordered this as a replacement.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I originally  bought this book because it had been on the New York Times top ten for over a year, and I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. It turned out to be a very original psychological suspense story told in alternate chapters by the two main characters.<br /><br />Your loyalities shift, your perception shifts, you are totally in the middle of a unique situation.<br /><br />Some friends of mine felt this was a very depressing book, but I was captivated all through, and satisfied by the ending.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love the Flo games, they hook you and waste time like crazy!  I don't like that you have to pay extra for more levels though!
0399226907|5.0|A must have...<br />It looks durable even tho our baby doesn't really play with it (bed time isn't really the best time to play) she does grab it and loves the bright colors and the holes! She's 11 months and we have been reading this book to her every night for almost 2 months now. She still gets excited when it becomes a &#34;beautiful butterfly&#34;!<br />The size of the book is perfect for an infant to hold it. (7&#34; x 5&#34;)<br />Best $5 ever spent ;)
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This is a very fun game.  Frustrating at times because I just can't figure out the next level. . . but then somehow I do!!
B001JIES4Q|5.0|it is a wonderful holiday movie for all ages.  if you haven't seen it, you really should! best movie ever!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is very fun for everyone in our family, old and young alike.  once you get hooked. .  you have a hard time putting it down.
B0028RXXE8|4.0|Film is very good. Acting and casting superb. However some of my disks have problems. Such as freezing in some sceans, picsels breaking up. I think the &#34;when in Rome &#34; features, would have been better if the action was frozen when the commentary is given, thereby giving the viewer the option of watching only that feature and not having to watch both the film and then the feature.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|lots of hidden object fun. good for hours of excitement. perfect game for relaxing after a long day to get a little me time.
0307388921|1.0|I DONT REMEMBER BUYING THIS SO I DONT WANT TO RATED IT UNFAIRLY PLEASE REMOVE FROM MY OPINION PAGE OF MY ACCOUNT
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked the book but not quite sure about the ending. It's definitely interesting to say the least. See what you think
B0015AARJI|5.0|bought this for our daughters boyfriend and he is a gamer plus.  was thrilled to receive and really enjoyed playing his games with it. arrived quickly and in gr8 shape
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|My daughter has such a hard time remembering what she reads, but after watching the movie, she wanted to read this book.  She loved reading every page comparing it to the movie; noting the differences and similarities. What a wonderful idea to make a child interested in reading and to make them think about what they are reading. Such a beautiful story about overcoming difficulties and rising above what is expected of you.
0393327345|1.0|DONT RECALL BUYING THIS SO I DONT WANT TO RATE IT PLEASE REMOVE IT FROM MY ACCOUNT I WOULD APPRECIATE IT
B00EEN7CAK|1.0|I really wish I hadn't made this purchase with the last of my Amazon gift card.<br />A very poor choice.
6304712499|5.0|gr8 movie.  very entertaining and the directors cut....how can u lose with that? arrived in speedy fashion and was in excellent condition
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is another one that if you can escape,  you can't go forward and try your hand and another puzzle.  When I could not escape, I just had to delete the app because there was no way for me to solve it without more practice.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is my second time through the Book.  Just as good as the first time.  I recommend this book for all ages.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I have just started playing this and am just learning how it is supposed to work.  So far I am winning, but  i can see that it gets harder the further you go.  One suggestion for the developer, your instructions lack a lot to be desired.  One of the things you don't explain is why at the top it says how many flows which could be 4 or 6, but there are only three sets to connect.  I am sure there is a simple explanation, so tell us.  Also, you say we must try to cover the entire board, but there is much about how to go about it you don't say.  I have,  so far, learned by trial and error, but it is frustrating when the maker does not tell us how the game is played.  I read your instructions, but you don't address the questions I have.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Well worth the time to read.  The layers of depth the author weaves into each character beautifully knits together a memorable and one of a kind story.
B0036FYO12|5.0|This is a classic and extremely well done thriller of the conspiracy genre. Excellent actors and superb story telling by the directors. Visually engaging. Well worth the time spent! This is probably the 5th time I have seen it, but not for at least 10-15 years.<br /><br />Great reflection back on high tech in the 70's and early 80's.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|it works its a great app. It made my phone run faster. Easy to use and its easy to navigate.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Great movie! It has an amazing story line but its worth watching for the cinamatography alone! Creative! Unique! And whimsical!
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|Quite honestly, I didn't know what to expect.  My wife suggested we watch it. I knew - within about 20 min's that this film had very little realism involved - with a plot more designed about reaching some final conclusion than bringing you there.  If - at least - the magic tricks in the film were more &#34;realistic&#34; than &#34;fantasy&#34; I think the film would have been better.  In the end - it just didn't feel real - very faked.  Oh well.
B009EEMMWW|4.0|Very cute romance story! A bit of a surprise ending. Definitely not for the close minded individual.....but maybe you might like her decision.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Its a little tricky to learn how to use right away. After a bunch of broken bottles i can finally cut certain bottles the way I want.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging!  This was a great game; keeping me busy for hours. It stumped me a couple times but I eventually got through all levels.
0385349947|1.0|This book preaches to CEO women who make millions. NOT to those who would really need advice on how to deal in the working world.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Never thought a game could be so addicted as this one!  Once you start playing, you will loose track of time.  It's great for long road trips and to kill the time.  Never boring always something new in each level. Love this game!!!
B005IY3CMQ|3.0|This is not a bad album, just disappointing.  Radiohead is a fascinating choice of band to remix.  But the tracks go from fantastic (the Mokeskelktor remix) to fairly ordinary to uninteresting.  If you're a real fan of Radiohead or remixes, a few of the tracks are worth it.  Otherwise, I'd skip it.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Season one and two were absolutely entertaining. Season three was good but not as good as the first two, am expecting great things from the fourth!!
B0027MJU00|5.0|What I love about Gillian Flynn's writing is that her characters are very different from &#34;typical&#34; characters and thereby so much more believable. Especially this novel, above others had a wonderfully developed protagonist.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|This app is pretty convenient and works well. I have it for both my Kindle and my phone, and I think it's more stable on a Kindle. It's crashed a few times on my phone so far, but never on my Kindle. It's nice to be able to chat with friends and check out the latest deals when I'm away from my computer.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|After reading poor reviews, I considered returning my CDs to Amazon without even opening it. Gladly, I decided to give it a listen first and was quite surprised that the quality is amazing. Sure, it's a direct rip from the DVD/Blu-ray, but I'd rather have that than a single edited disc where they leave out all the good songs (which is what happened on her last 3 live albums). The sound is eons better than on the HORRID Blu-ray defect (5.1 mix doesn't have sound on the right side speakers). On The CDs, her voice is very crisp and loud as well as the instruments. I'm glad I decided to keep my copy, this is her best live album yet.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book provides ancient wisdom for both the novice and the most advanced spiritual seeker. Everyone should read this and I guarantee that your life will change for the better because of it! Valuable information to help us make our lives more of what we want it to be.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This was a good movie. I am not a science fiction fan, but this movie held my interest and I would rent it again. A lot of suspense and action.
B004UUKD6W|5.0|IS A VERY GOOD CD orquestras CLASSIC WHERE AS KILLER QUEEN, NOW I HERE AND STONE COLD CRAZY QUEEN IS NOT THE MOST KNOWN BY ALL THAT IS ONE OF THE FIRST DISC BUT IBAN VE ALREADY MAKING A SOUND AND A VERY PARTICULAR COMPOSCION IN THE SEVENTIES IDEAL FOR fANS OF OLD TIME CONSIDERING THAT COMES WITH AN INTERESTING THINGS THAT BRINGS EP SONGS LIKE THIS CD IN VIVO AND IN LONDON BBC NOT LISTED IN ANY CD LIVE BAND
B00BKTFABE|1.0|not working on my kindle...i have followed directions and removed it then reloaded it...the hi def 1080 doesnt work and thats ok but now it has stopped working all together..
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|BLACK SABBATH CD escepcional<br /><br />VERSION IS A VERY GOOD THE BEST BUY BECAUSE UNLIKE THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN AND ENGLISH HAS A BONUS ISSUE THAT ONLY IN JAPANESE EDITION THIS IS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE AND HAS THE SAME SONGS ONLY THAT EXCEEDS THIS HAS THE SHM-CD SOUND BAND SOUNDS AND SOUND CONVINCING that does not disappoint CURRENT OR OLD OR YOUNG BAND FOLLOWERS<br />THE FIRST THREE SONGS ARE STRONG AND ALSO NO BONUS FOR NOT STAYED IN HOME ORIGINAL.OZZY CD TOMMY AND CIA ARE BACK AND YOU CAN NOT LOSE WHAT YOU BEST CD FOR MY THEME IS Lonner REMEMBER THIS FORMATION OF BLACK SABBATH HEAVY METAL IS NOT A SOUND BUT IS MORE A HEAVY ROCK SONGS WHERE DID TOMMY FOR OZZY is brilliant
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|saw the katy perry movie and thought i'd try out some of her music.  not a bad CD; liked most of the songs.

B0045TQF88|5.0|A CD INFALTABLE WHY WHERE IS THE ONLY SING AND BRINGS GRAHAN BONNET VERY IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL MATERIAL FOR COLLECTORS OF RAINBOW
B0052GACNM|3.0|This collection of duets was mostly a disappointment although there are some songs on this CD that I did enjoy.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|Please don't waste your money on this movie.  Honestly they should pay you to see it.  It has a terrible story line.  Completely unbelievable scenarios, one person moving a large boat out of a tree all by himself.  Superman!<br />Just don't do it!  Don't
B000002LSV|4.0|I had this back in the day on cassette (remember them ?) and finally got around to replacing it on CD.Good Find and Good Price.
1419702238|5.0|He loves all the Wimpy kid books
0385528787|4.0|First of all, I thought I'd read \\"The Year of the Flood\\" but I soon found that no, I'd made some mistake somewhere, though I've read \\"Oryx and Crake\\" several times as it was my favorite Atwood book for some time. So, if you haven't read \\"The Year of the Flood\\" I think one will do okay, though I MUST read it! You do have to have read Oryx and Crake or there's not much point.<br />  Margaret Atwood... her gentle and sad (and sometimes to me, useless, bland to the point of invisibility) characters and their lives, this is another of her books in her unique style, the third in her series and to me maybe having more hope than some of her books, some of them leave me feeling satisfied but depressed, this book is actually a bit more about HOPE... one never knows what is going to happen in life and in a book till one turns the page... there can be hope....<br /> This series seems to be a little bit of a bridge, if you don't like Atwood this may be a series that you can like, it's like a bridge to more science fictiony writing, but still with her soft but unsubtle social criticism/commentary, this series has that and is even less subtle, it's blatant social commentary. But Oh well... from \\"A Handmaid's Tale\\" she is KNOWN for that.<br /> So, Oryx and Crake was one of my favorites of hers, this is almost as good... I'd definitely recommend it, one needs to read the third in the series!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|As a now retired individual, I can relate to this story.  Acting and casting was well done and their stories were believable.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|I love this movie,one of my favorites. The speech the President gives to he fighter pilots before they get in their planes is one of the best movie speeches ever. I always get gooss bumps by the end of it.
B00902S0IS|5.0|Great old classic. One of the best early SciFi flicks. Good special effects for the time. Robbie the Robot's debut.
B000003337|5.0|Great cd it was worth the money.it was cool hearing him play sons other than with ozzy osbourne.gone too young,imagine if he didn't die in that plane crash.he would've blown Eddie van halen away!!!!!
B007U1FEJE|5.0|...though the rest of the songs on this CD are wonderful, too! The Beach Boys still sound great and amazingly, the harmonies are as beautiful as they ever were. Their nostalgic sound takes me back to the 60's and the sweet days of teenage summers.  I highly recommend this album for any Beach Boys fan: you won't be disappointed!
B000MD9UJC|5.0|YES PRODUCT WAS AS DESCRIBED. THIS RESOLVED MY LAMPS BEING BURNED IN MIDDLE OR BEGINNING OF LOOKING FOR SOMETHING OR INSPECTING A DIM TO NO LIGHT LOCATIONS. KIT CAME  IN ABOUT A WEEK. WILL<br />ORDER SOME MORE LATER. SWITCH A LITTLE SENSITIVE BUT OK
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This husband-wife story was much more interesting than I would have thought --- my wife is now reading it since I told her the wife's character was incredible but really fantastic., `
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Fascinating concept. Enjoyed the challenge. Still working on getting through the levels. Do a few every night to keep my mind active
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I have always loved the music Zac Brown and his band perform.  This is just another great  to add to their list of music.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|My problem with this is suppose my battery runs low and I really want to be woke up?  My battery can run low at any time.  It seems I'm always plugging it in!
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|Growing up, I always wanted to be a dinosaur. This movie taught me that I should never stop chasing my dreams! ROAR!
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This series is fantastic. Claire Danes is incredible in her part she plays. The whole cast is great. Can't wait for season 3 to start.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Please, if you are a serious foodie and embarking on a lifestyle change to improve your health - you must get this book.  Better than a 'starter kit' it is an adventure in mental and physical health through food.  A serious companion to this one is \\"Well Fed\\".  You won't be sorry.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|TIME!  One day we want time to speed up and the next day we want to slow down time.  This is the story or three individuals and their lives and how they view time.  This book made me think about time and how I view what is going on in my life.  We are each given so much time in this life do we really see what is happening or do we wish our time away?  This is not a spiritual look at time but a human approach.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Bought this Ap for my kindle fire HD it is brilliant. Shows how much battery is left in varying colours as the battery gets fuller. defo recommend it's a great Ap and the other bonus... it's Freeeeeee
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is a enjoyable loving story from the dog's perspective of his journey through life with his human family. Great life lessons in love, determination, commitment, and friendships are sprinked throughout the story. Humorous and thought-provoking at the same time. I would recommend this to all dog owners or any one considering what it may be like to own and love a dog and family!
B008220BLG|5.0|This was a present for my friend. I did find a better price at wal*mart, but thank you for giving this to my friend. I really appreciate it :).
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a challenge but I have won once with random deals. Nice to be able to pass the time with the game.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|If you liked Airplane 2 and Snakes On A Plan, you'll love this movie.  Now, does anybody know where I put my Swingline stapler?
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game is fun ( & addictive)! I would actually give it 4 1/2, if allowed! It is a bit confusing to figure out, but with so many levels of achievement, it will  provide LOTS playing time!!
B004EPYZZI|5.0|Product is excellent!  My family and I just live it!  I would recommend this to all my friends and family!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|In a time such as this, where there is minimal FDA approval on foods, (ANY meat products especially) compared to 30 yrs ago, this movie has great educational value to the consumer of foods. ALL foods. We as a country need to wake up seriously to what is going on with the food industry. It is NOT right and NOT humane to the animals we do eat. Farmers should be allowed to grow food for us that is NOT modified genetically and keep their own seeds, AND mostly NOT be penalized for doing so or for other GMO seeds getting contaminated with their  pure crops. This movie also shows the evil that exists presently, and greed within the political office that is being allowed/tolerated by us as a nation.This movie has shown me that I can make a difference 3x a day, by choosing to eat what is actually good for me and humane. A real eye opener, this movie is.. EXCELLENT.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I love this show! Jess and I are kindred spirits. I love that in the extras it talks about her outfits on the show, cause they are so cute
B00005J9PB|5.0|&#34;Tank Girl&#34; is a Classic Movie. A Post Apocalyptic Comedy!<br /><br />Lori Petty is a comic genius in this crazy wild ride. When you're in the mood for pure escapism this movie is always good for a few laughs.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|If you loved &#34;My So Called Life&#34; you will love this show.  If you love teenage angst, this show is for you.
1451697686|5.0|I love this book. Bea has great ideas and is very inspiring. I don't think my home will ever be zero waste, but I have gone through everything I own and have given away what I don't absolutely love. I think the people at Goodwill know my name. I also bought a worm compost system. I'm slowly but surely simplifying. Bea's blog is wonderful too.
B00D0Z2JR4|4.0|Overall, this movie is funny and interesting.<br />Only thing I don't like about this movie is the last fight between Bill and Goku Saiyan God.<br />It wasn't intense at all, rather boring...
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story seemed disjointed and in my opinion left us with some loose ends.<br />I didn't relate well to some of the characters.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I am glad that I got this app for my Android phone. I have really enjoyed it. I can easily listen to my music with this app.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|I was first drawn to this album after I realized I had Soundhound-ed \\"Pompeii\\" 3 times in a row and decided to purchase it due to all the positive reviews. And I was NOT let down. This has been my go-to album the last 2 weeks no matter my mood. I love it and just can't get enough. I think I may have found my new favorite band of 2013!
B008OOYALE|5.0|its a great it's fun I love dragons games this is a great game I think it the best game
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Jason Bourne is a beast in this book he is as awesome as the Matt Damon Jason Bourne read thus
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|It's gorgeous, it feels great, it functions perfectly, it's expensive, and it sure ain't my 'everyday' case. I think my normal wear and tear over a year's time would probably absolutely trash this one, so I use it for professional situations, travel, and evenings out. During normal work-a-day life, I stick to a slightly more robust and simple case and keep this one pristine. Great design, makes a great impression, and is a treat to use.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I have enjoyed watching the good wife. I can appreciate that Alicia has made a vow and has continued in her marriage with Peter even though he has done everything to break them. The trust between a  married couple has been broken in a very publicly humiliating way and yet Alicia has come out with her head held up high. The cost of these betrayals is felt by the entire family.  I like that I don't have to watch sex on t.v. although it is mentioned I don't have to watch it. love it
B005UDD1R6|1.0|It does not work properly when I try to play mp4 or m4v. The playback speed is very very slow.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have been a fan of downtown abbey for a few years now.  Season three had more surprises than the other seasons.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app works great.  I can't believe this is free.  I travel a lot and this works well.  It is way better than using my cell phone.
B00E687MWQ|4.0|This album is a little \\"slower\\" than the previous Satyricon albums. I have been a fan of this band for several years and do really enjoy the fact that they try to keep it \\"fresh\\" and do not follow the same pattern for each album. Very few \\"Heavy\\" tracks. This album got me in the mood of listening while drinking a cup of coffee and reading Edgar Allan Poe or H.P Lovecraft. It is good, worth the listening. As most Satyricon album, the first time you listen to it you won't enjoy it as much, but as you keep, it grows in you.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Again Martin has thrown me a  curveball twist at the end.  I can truly say that I did not see it coming.  Can't wait to get into book 4.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Needs more tone options. I really like the weather display and the different choices for clock display. Also the ability to dim the display .
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book so much! John Green is such an creative writer, this book is a great balance of funny and sad! I must warn you, you are going to cry at least towards the end of the book
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|No where on the site does it tell you that this will ONLY work on ROUND bottles which upset me because the only bottles i had been collecting to do this were slightly square. And as far as \\"wide mouth\\" bottles are concerned this will not hold them if the stopper of the tool is smaller then the \\"mouth\\". The only bottle I did perfectly (out of 4 so far) I had a friend help hold the tool while I rotated the bottle only one time, so it does work by scoring one time. I think im going to try to rig it to a table or something so its not so Awkward or needs four hands to use properly or just do a lot of bottle cutting get together with craft loving friends. I see no reason to send it back since I think the little imperfections can give some crafts character. But maybe practice makes perfict. The shipping took 8 days, which was within the delivery estimation.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Functions really well. Love the big buttons; Good for those of us that refuse to get bifocals! Also saves time for me if I've left my phone at home and need to add something up quickly.
B004P1JEWU|4.0|The tv adaptation followed the books quite closely, (apart from Jayne westerly) and its no wonder with the outstanding descriptions. You don't need imagination to visualise the gruesome and brilliant characters and the places they live. For once an author has caputured what ppl are really like, the good and the bad.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was more than excited to get my Chromecast.  It was back ordered, and then Amazon got it to me more than a month sooner than expected.  Nice job Amazon.  My entire hope for this device was to drop my subscription for HuluPlus and just use my laptop to cast episodes full screen.  Turns out my 2006 Macbook Core two duo running Snow Leopard can't really cut it. Later I find Chromecast wants OSX 10.7 or better, which I cannot install on my machine (not a criticism of Google.  I probably need to start paying closer attention to system requirements with my decrepit computers).  However, my 2008 iMac with a faster processor running the same OS casts perfectly, so it's clear casting is processor intensive.  I usually get annoyed when folks post bad reviews for entirely non-product related flaws, so no stars off for this issue.<br /><br />Set up was a snap, even in a non supported OS! It was a strange procedure of connecting to a wifi network generated by the Chromecast itself and then setting it up. Then I was instructed to disconnect from that and go back to my house's WAN for normal use. I'm wondering just how possible it might be hack my Chromecast and gain access to my house WAN with this unsecured signal from the device (the Chromecast stores the WEP key).  Minus a star.<br /><br />The Chromecast app in iOS works great.  It's a joy to be able to share YouTube videos with my wife without having to hold my iPhone between us. I don't have anything up in GooglePlay so I can't comment on that, and we don't subscribe to Netlfix.  My other great hope is Google will come through on their statement to produce/host more apps to cast more media from other sources.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|And Jon Voight, Roy Scheider, Clare Danes and Dean Stockwell.  Well executed story and particularly fun to see a young Matt Damon at work in this 1997 movie about a heartless medical insurance company.  Only surprise was the surprise witness who came forth to save the day, but even that is a typical Perry Mason type touch.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Once again Forsyth has told a great story.A must read for his many fans and for anyone who enjoys that great feeling when the good guys win.Even the politician's behave sensibly. Clearly a work of fiction. One of the best stories I have read this summer.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great.I love the excitement of just daring myself to make it to the next level.I love to see how many coins I can get before I crash or fly into the sky with my binoculars looking flying object's.And this game really keep me occupied for hours just amusing.

B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|I heavily relied on Kelby's  Lightroom 4  book, and this one on LR5 is equally a gem.  Kelby is a master at taking the mystery out of it all, making Lightroom shine.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great film with ts own unique adventure feeding off of Lord of the rings. They have two more movies to follow this one to complete the trilogy. A must have
B005544TRQ|4.0|The show has an interesting twist and is fun to watch but I'm having trouble figuring out how they're going to keep it interesting in the upcoming seasons.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Hands down best show/series on tv. Each season gets better, looking forward to the new season that's coming out this month
075669910X|5.0|Purchased this book for my 12 year old son and he is mesmerized!  The pictures are gorgeous and the index is excellent.  He is mainly interested in dinosaurs but is drawn in to the aquatic and plant life that this book offers.  I confess that I got sucked in a few nights ago after he went to bed.  So inviting and interesting.  Don't hesitate.  The best $20 I have spent in a long time.
B003F46RVO|5.0|Great movie. Classic flick. Music and pictures 80's style horror comedy movie. - Streaming via prime excellent quality and experience.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Love this entire Avenged Sevenfold album! Definitely worth the wait, Not one bad song...You won't be disappointed! Hail to the king
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|Didn't see this in the theater so it may have lost some bite in the translation of the special effects to my big Kindle HD.  Still, the story was a bit weak.  The magic tricks are good...but this is a movie.  It is more exciting when it is live.  No room for error.  Maybe this is why magic themed movies have never really made it to the top of anyone's list.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo plays a good role as the detective.  Hints all through the movie as to what is going on and who is running everything but you don't care in the end.  James Franco's little brother plays a good role as the new kid on the block to magic...and to movies.  Expect to see more of him.  Same good looks but none of the slacker, dopey eyes.  Harrelson and Fisher are all but bit players.  I liked The Social Network and it appears that the persona of Zuckerburg is still haunting Eisenberg.<br /><br />It was mildly entertaining.  Watched 1/2 at night the other half the next day...rental.....it was that exciting.  Was blown away by the trailer....but then...the movie just sort of fell over on itself and disappeared into blah.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|this game is awesome you will love it. what you do is save people from dieing in dumb ways awesome.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I wish they would restart and make more seasons or at least a movie.<br />Would definitely recommend this show for any Sci-Fi fans
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|use it mostly for alarm clock . Does everthing it should with nice graphics. Gradual increase in volume is nice feature
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|I enjoy physics/strategy games that make you think a little bit. This one involves drawing lines to control where the sand falls. Best free app of the day I've downloaded in quite awhile.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love every type of Kindle product I own. Kindle for Androids? CHANGED MY LIFE! Long lines, traffic jams, 2 hour wait in the doctor's office - I'm OK with that. Pull out my cell, turn to my novel of the day and I am in my zone.
B005LAIIN0|1.0|As a satisfied HD and non-BR user, it is sad to see the continued squeeze forcing consumers to limited choices.  Hilarious that reviewers are asking for the theatrical version to be on BR, whereas I bemoan the fact that unless you get BR (and a player for it!) no can see the unrated version.  I loved the ungory theatrical, but looked forward to the adult version.  I will not watch a movie on a computer screen, nor \\"buy\\" cyber movies (I know just another old Luddite,) so unless the BR gangsters allow the HD-DVD to come out, many of us won't see the unrated version.  Pure unsustainable greed killed the radio guys, shooting for the movies too?  AND I AM REVIEWING THE PRODUCT/ITEM, but also the way it's merchandized.
B008M87GJK|2.0|I just don't like the format.  It's a bit of a challenge to fine info.  They have, and always have had, good coverage of major stories.  I just find it easier to use some other sources.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|I have tried several different EQ apps for my phone,  some great some absolutely garbage. The first thing that impressed me was the fact that the EQ app was just an overlay. You can open it anywhere, anytime, and easily change your settings without leaving your app. Super cool. Only downside is that its not the most beautiful app I've seen. But I would definitely recommend this.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I especially like the map.  It is clear, and deliniates where the weather is coming from.  Other graphics are well done and easy to interpret.
B00DYVU9K8|1.0|Amazon Prime is great. Delivered on time and on the release date.<br /><br />Movie review: I don't normally just bash things, but this movie was/is terrible. It is really slow and I thought it was poorly edited. I would not recommend watching or buying this movie. It lacks any of the qualities you need to have for a good movie.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|This purchase was to refresh my memory in preparation for Season Three. This transaction went perfectly, but I had a problem with another part of the same order: The Complete First Season. Express Media sent a BluRay version rather than the DVD that was ordered. I am in the middle of trying to exchange this but, until I receive a useable First Season, the Second Season is of marginal use.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The author gives rare insight into the greatest story ever told. Separates fact from fiction and gives facts  from various sources<br />to show how that New Testament was formed several hundred years after the events that took place  and how it was manipulated to suit the needs for the Christian  preachers and later the dogma of the Catholic  Church. Jesus was not born in Bethlehem he was from Nazareth and had brothers and sisters which makes the virgin birth story hard to substantiate. His brother James was a follower of John the Baptistand only became a follower of Jesus after the Baptists death at the hands of Herod Antipas.<br />a great book for anyones who is interested in the true beginnings of the Christian Church.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Great young adult book...loved the characters and felt like I was right there with them. So far I'm loving this author!
B00E6887H0|5.0|Wow!  I ordered the 2-LP set.  The vinyl sounds GREAT!  And Ry's voice and guitar have NEVER sounded better.  Definitely one of my favorite releases of 2013!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I love the intricacy of the three stories and how they eventually intertwined. Will definitely look into other books by this author.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I got this game for free from Amazon app store. The first several stages are introductory and fun. As one goes on, it becomes somewhat challenging. Fun to have some brainstorm anyway.
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|Limited special effects but ok for a single viewing.  I don't really buy anyone could pull that off with two pistols :)
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Emeli has a unique sound and I love playing her CD while I'm in the car. She is a very talented and entertaining person.
B0096DZKZC|4.0|this is an amazing game but it won't download. The kindle is saying I don't have enough space left but I still have tons of it.
B0044WUIHA|5.0|Tom Hanks is so good as a lost soul.  Whales! She married Dr. Spalding! Best line in the movie is, &#34;I'm sorry Wilson!&#34;
B00881VLCE|5.0|i love this puzzle.  just the right size to finish in just a few minutes and with my ADD i only have a few minutes!
B00BHWG0HW|5.0|I`m a big sci-fi fan. We own the series from &#34;Enterprize, orginal Star Trek, and are now working on Star Trek the Next Generation&#34;.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This app is awesome but it needs more updates like the end/nether, Redstone update, endermen, melons, more better mods, and skins. But either than that I think this game is awesome!!!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love Love Love!! I cant say enough about this show! I watched Season 1 in one weekend! Halfway through Season 2 now
B000YCLRBA|5.0|I loved the Music.<br />The singing was super<br />Dmitri was the Perfect Onegin<br /> I never get tired of watching it.<br />What ore do you want  than an evening with first class singers & music.
1484161653|5.0|An exciting roller coaster ride of emotions and passion that at no time eases up...an interesting and dramatic debut that is sure to have readers aching for more. This compelling story is an amazing combination of emotion, suspense and drama. Siczak is sure to be a must-read author. A very good read that I enjoyed very much.<br /><br />Fascinating...a winner! I will sum up my recommendation in two words: read it. Siczak is a superb writer, one who draws the reader inside the lives of her characters with such ease that you feel like you've known them in person. Action-packed and suspenseful. I'd recommend to anyone.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I highly recommend. A quick read that keeps you engaged from start to finish. It's a great story of living with choices, yours and the ones you love.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Bought this book after seeing the Dr. Michael Moseley documentary on a flight. Book was easy to read and handy to look up calories of different foods. Not so much a diet as more a way of life and relatively easy to do. Really flexible in how you want to apply this technique to life. The book is a brief summary of the documentary.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I wasn't a zombie show fan in the least until I started this show.  I love the characters and storyline!
6305428042|5.0|I love watching this with my five year old.<br /><br />Hate having to explain the virgin thing, or rather getting of topic.<br /><br />Other than that, great movie.
B001NLL93W|5.0|If you are looking for the next great teen series to follow then you have found it. A firbiddin love romance with deadly mystery all in one.
B00992CF6W|1.0|THE LAMEST GAME, I'VE EVER TRIED.<br />EVEN ON A LG SCREEN......<br />SAMSUNG&reg; GALAXY S4...&trade; DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.<br />1_of_5 *'s
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What an amazing story.  I couldn't put it down and I marveled at the use of language, imagination.  Loved it!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Really puts you into the story and you feel like you're part of the book. It's great and being a gamer, I can relate a lot.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Great Movie. Perfect packaging. Package was exactly as described. Good price. Other dealers want to charge much more. Very entertaining.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|As of right now, I'm still reading but its great. I've predominantly worked for large commercial companies that emphasize shipping &#34;complete&#34; products. It's been a revelation to think of shipping smaller &#34;experimental&#34; products and measuring the customer response *before* building a complete product. This is one of my two favorite books now.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Hannibal himself is just like the movies. A force that will twist your mind like black hole theories! He leaves you speechless with his inhuman and super human traits. He is both Madman and Genius.
1401937268|5.0|I purchased these cards because they were mandatory to complete my training. I really wanted another deck, but figured at some point I would purchase them so why not now.<br />Just getting acquainted with my cards and am just loving them. They have a gentle, loving energy, have been quite accurate (judging from my feedback) and offer advise without judgement. Really beautiful images enhance the quality. It was a great choice and I will enjoy working with them for years to come.
B00991TCOG|5.0|There's nothing to complain about here. Good music is exactly that, good music. If you don't like this type of music don't buy it, but I LOVE it!
B0035JNTA6|3.0|If you are looking for a movie that requires no real thought to enjoy this would be it.  Just a average movie, but funny.
B0001BKAEE|5.0|There's nothing to complain about here. Good movie is exactly that, good movie. I love the matrix! This final movie was certainly my favorite.
B000065V42|5.0|It is a perfect family movie.  I wish more family friendly movies like that  were made.  I'm tired of movies with talking animals.
B001ECDVKE|4.0|This movie is slap stick hilarious! It's cast and animation work really well together to make a solid funny movie.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I grew up watching the Goonies.  I love that my kids are now watching it and loving it as much as I did.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Great Movies. Perfect packaging. Package was exactly as described. Good price. Other dealers want to charge much more. Very entertaining.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|One of the best books I have read in years.  Believable and very interesting plot and scenario.<br />I could not put the book down which caused problems for my schedule.
B00006AG5N|5.0|There's nothing to complain about here. Good music is exactly that, good music. If you don't like this type of music don't buy it, but I LOVE it!
B004MC0FO8|4.0|This is a nice tool. I think the times I use it most are on songs used during movie end credits. I like the way you can listen to the song on your phone or purchase and download.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I got this movie because, well it's awesome! It's hilarious and all around entertaining! It also has a few of the Beetlejuice cartoons on it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Thank you! I got the ebook on my kindle when I couldn't find a hard copy anywhere in town. You made my week!
B00006FDCD|5.0|This movie has been a classic horror for years and I don't think it will stop. This movie is great! If you're afraid of clowns... Even better!
0545101425|5.0|The case was slightly worn, but the case wasn't the reason I ordered this audiobook. The CDs themselves were in excellent condition and provided mental stimulation for some very long hours on the road - hours made shorter by a great story.
B00BHWG5C2|5.0|November 1969. Los Angeles Forum, the second show, and I was there!  I've owned the original Ya-Ya's for years, decades really, but I knew it was missing some of my favorite pieces.  This expanded edition hits it!  BB King, Ike and Tina Turner AND THE ROLLING STONES!  Brian was gone, and missed, but this new guy, MIck Taylor, was amazing!  The Stones were in excellent form from start to finish, and what a finish with Mick drenching the crowd with rose petals!  In the middle Mick and Keith doing an acoustic session of old blues tunes with Charlie tappin' a light beat in the shadows; the latter was my favorite part of the show.  Charlie was good that night!  If your a Stones fan from way back then and attended one of those US concerts, or even if you're new to the wonders of the Stones, this is a MUST HAVE volume which includes a DVD of some of the songs and Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin at the concert.  It's worth the shekals, in fact, it's worth more than shekals for this greatest moment from out of the past, The Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band In The World:  THE ROLLING STONES!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This Series is amazing!  I wish all books could be written this well, and all twists this dramatic.  Good thing they aren't though, or I would never get anything done.  Everyone should read this series!  EVERYONE!
0345495004|4.0|Good read!  The book was a historical fiction, based on the true story of the relationship between architect Frank Lloyd<br />Wright and Martha Cheney.  Good character development. Frank and Martha become involved in a romantic relationship despite both being married with families.  Their relationship lead them to leave families, go to Europe and<br />buck the approval of society.  Surprise, but true ending!  Do not google these two people or you will spoil the ending.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|This is a ridiculous book, and I don't know how it ever made it to be a movie.  Hard to follow, boring, don't read this!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is probably the best alarm I have found. It goes off at the time I set it unlike others I have tried to use. This app is awesome :)
B000FBJAOG|1.0|Not what I expected, I couldn't even finish reading it.  It is what it says a made up guide for a made up event.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|Got it fast and on time, in excellent condition too. Just what I always wanted. This is one of the best batman animation movies I've seen.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|This is a good series, though a little exagerrated I think.  They try and make it plausible, but thats not really the focus of the story, and the situations are good enough to keep you hooked!
140006922X|4.0|interesting take on the life of Jesus . It calls for more reading on the topic.<br /> It made you find other books on the sdubject.
B0037QM8YA|3.0|I watched this movie because my wife wanted to see it, but I actually enjoyed it, it was not at all what I expected.
030759565X|5.0|I received this book as a gift and love it!!  I've already tried several recipes and I love how easy it is to follow along.  The stories add a lot of fun to it and I love how she even discusses at the back of the book how to throw a dinner party!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|This book had me snoozing from page one.  I read this because of a recomendation and hope that my recomendation will stop someone from reading it.
B00BMNM4H6|1.0|no brains needed for this one, not even worth spending the money and it was FREE!!  Spend $6.99 and invest in a mystery puzzle game that takes hours to play and you use your memory and it puts you into the worlk fo detective work.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This book had to be hard to write, but it is worth reading.  A great idea and well written.  It really changes your perspective on things, whether good or bad.
B0037QM8YA|4.0|Story line was a very harsh look into how things are in a world we don't want to think about.  Very tough and obvious it spreads from generation to generation.  Worth watching but, sad to see this goes on.
B007SGM084|2.0|I read this series, because of all the hype around it, and maybe for a middle aged woman its a good story but for any guy, don't waste your time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I loved playing this game. My grand daughter got me into it. I found out last month that my sister and brother are also playing. It start off easy but get harder as you go on. I like the fact you can start over, go ahead, or skip. (It can go on and on). With this game when I get stuck I call on my grand daughter. (She seen to be a pro). Also good for thinking.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Jack Reacher is always a good read, and this one is as well.  Sometimes the books don't meld chronologically but its still a good read for anyone at anytime.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|After reading that so many people are becoming addictive to this game, I decided not to get involved. Apparently this is a very interesting game so one less player will not destroy the reviews.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This Series is amazing!  I wish all books could be written this well, and all twists this dramatic.  Good thing they aren't though, or I would never get anything done.  Everyone should read this series!  EVERYONE!
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|I watched Tangled with my 6 year old granddaughter.  It was actually her 9th time, (she has the video).  The story is delightful and it was so much fun to watch.  I highly recommend this movie for young and old.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This Series is amazing!  I wish all books could be written this well, and all twists this dramatic.  Good thing they aren't though, or I would never get anything done.  Everyone should read this series!  EVERYONE!
B00CXQL828|5.0|I was expecting great musicianship and a lot of chops being shown off.  What I wasn't expecting was how good the songs are.  This really is an album that you can listen to from beginning to end.  In an era with so little rock being on the radio and TV, its great to hear an album like this.  Along with the Rival Sons and Black Country Communion (unfortunately now defunct), this is one of my favorite new acts and albums of the last few years.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This book really got me hooked on the Reacher novels, and with about a million of them out there, I will always have a good book to look forward too.
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|I recently saw them this summer and could tell then that this new album would be a step up from their last.  The playing is more cohesive and has more of an identity and the songs are stronger than their 1st studio album.  Very good album.  I definitely would recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really liked this book, as I do with most Stephen King books.  This is a little bit of a departure from his usual, but in a good way and I would recommend this book to any and everyone.
B0053ZOQMK|4.0|This is a very funny movie. I laughed from start to finish. Jonny Depp (Rango) was hilarious. Great movie. I recommend it to all ages.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This Series is amazing!  I wish all books could be written this well, and all twists this dramatic.  Good thing they aren't though, or I would never get anything done.  Everyone should read this series!  EVERYONE!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I really, really like this show (and this season!). I was close to giving 5 stars but this show is not in the same league as say Lost, the Sopranos, Breaking Bad, etc - but very close!
B004TI5N38|3.0|Though the book was good, and I read it cover to cover, it had the feel that I had read this a hundred times.  The same cop story thats been done and done again.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I was curious about the book after having watched a season of the show on A&E.  Was not disappointed as the story, characters and styling was apparently faithfully followed on the small screen.  Love the depth of characters and their interrelationships.  My husband will love the detaild shooting/firearm references!
B000UZNRS2|4.0|This is a good series, though a little exagerrated I think.  They try and make it plausible, but thats not really the focus of the story, and the situations are good enough to keep you hooked!
0399226907|5.0|Again, this is a classic, proven through time and many many toddlers to be one of their very favorite story books.  Certainly this is so with my great-grandchildren.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This Series is amazing!  I wish all books could be written this well, and all twists this dramatic.  Good thing they aren't though, or I would never get anything done.  Everyone should read this series!  EVERYONE!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Excellent 3D compared to the one with the paper red and blue glasses that was sent to me on my first order.  I sent it back and Amazon gave me a refund.  The new one was designed for the new 3D TVs and to be used with the glasses supplied by the manufacturer.  I never was able to view the original Polar Express all the way through because the 3D was so bad it almost caused nausea.  The. new version is absolutely great!!!  Be careful when ordering this DVD that it is the correct version for your TV.  Make sure the picture of the product says Blu ray 3D before ordering.  The picture shown on this review is not the new 3D version.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was an outstanding book about how we as people try to avoid the different. That is why i recommend this for knowledgeable readers.
B0009P66TK|1.0|The hands fell off. I really am disappointed. I wore it for about six months to the office. No strenuous activity. I still wore it on my left hand. I loved that it had crown on the left side because now the crown does not dig into the back of my hand. I got a lot of compliments on this watch. I'm really disappointed. I have $28 Casio watches that I have been wearing for years and I wore them mountain biking, kayaking, hiking and playing racquet ball and never had a problem. I won't buy another invicta.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This movie was well worth the wait.  The writers haven't lost site of the original story line of the set down By Jean Roddenberry
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Cool device, but found limited apps a bit disappointing. I know they are coming but there is no timetable from what I can tell.<br />-Did a great job with HD cast from YouTube.<br />-Chrome browser display was adequate<br />-Tried using Flickr slide show mode through browser interface and it was VERY sluggish<br />-Installation was not as seamless as advertised. I have FiOS and had to make changes to network setting that most basic users would not comprehend.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I purchased this free book for my 10 year old daughter's Kindle. She has read the book in school and loves this classic story. I am thrilled to be able to get classics like this for free for her to read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome get this game.  I recomend you get it.  ITS SO AWESOME!!!!!!!  I love this game.  Its so  cool and funny.<br /><br />Its so fun to play
B004P4S4NM|5.0|This is still one of my favorite CDs to listen to. I love Adele. True talent, which is so hard to find in music these days. Recommend this CD to everyone!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a great GAME! my son plays it all the time. I would definately recommend the game to any parent that has a child that likes horses
B008XG1X18|5.0|We put this app onto our Kindle, already addicted whenever I am online. Great site/app and you will be addicted too!
B00006RAKP|5.0|If you like Elton John you will love this mix of songs.  Well worth its cost.  Hope you enjoy it too!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Absolutely my very favorite musical ever. There are no words that can explain how much I love this story. The film is magnificent. Every single character is played well. They successfully took RENT from the stage to the big screen. I also own the soundtrack and listen to it frequently. If somehow you have not yet seen this, please do so immediately. You won't be sorry.

B002361MLA|5.0|I have read many self-help books in my life, but this is without doubt the best.<br />Initially difficult to take on board, Tolle's philosophy in 'The Power of Now' seeped into my very soul as I read it.<br />This is not a book for the mind to absorb. Instead it imprints the core truths into one's heart and soul. At times, I find myself standing in my kitchen, worried about my children making their way in the world when suddenly wisdom from this book stops me and reminds me to breathe deeply and trust in God.<br />Eckhart Tolle learnt it the hard way in the midst of a total breakdown, he came to understand that his mind was incessantly chewing on fearful thoughts and making up stories of past regrets and future anxieties.<br /><br />The basic problem, he concurred stemmed from the mind 'the constant noise' from living in the past and thinking the future would deliver a fantasy, only to be bitterly disappointed and end back on the mind thread mill again.<br />I have found it is the only way to live my life. Amen to Tolle!
B00168OIOE|5.0|It's exactly what I was looking for it has the widescreen and fullscreen versions of the film which most of the DVDs don't I just wish it had ultraviolet which it doesn't.

B006FK7SZ4|4.0|Well I have added and deleted this app a number of times but that's only because there are a lot of fakes out there. It is not the apps fault, trust there are people that actually want to talk and hangout, find em.

B005LAJ1O0|2.0|This tv series is overrated.  The acting is okay, but the show has too much sex, too much dirty language and too much violence. It comes close to being a piece of trash.  I cannot believe that they allow such crap on tv.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Very good quality. Camera, lenses, flash are super safe in this bag. Comfortable design yo ve called as a best fit back pack.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Not all whodunit. But how did they do it.  The misdirection is exceptional. And has a great twist at the very end.
B001I10ABE|5.0|If you watch some of the videos out on the making of the record you will learn about James going and getting vocal lessons.  Because the quality is so high you are hearing more than any would have heard before in the mix.  In singing and in pronunciation, you actually emphasize a Z sound so that an S can be heard in the mix by the listener.  In vocal training this is part of the way you make sure your words are understood.  So this actually might be what you are hearing.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|This follows the basic trilogy lineup.  The first book is excellent, second one is a bit of a let down, and the third bounces back.  I am overall a big fan of Sanderson but sometimes the book rushes too fast, even for a book of this length.  In the end though I couldn't really put it down so maybe it was just me rushing!  Vin is a great character though and I always enjoyed her viewpoint.  While I like the other characters, I generally just couldn't wait until they got back to Vin.
B00DJYKFXG|3.0|i don't like to write user reviews of music on here, it's all subjective. This is about the box set. It's The Band, I love it. However if you have the Rock Of Ages album, you have most of what's on here.<br /><br />Disc 1 & 2 is the show sequenced from performances on 12/28/71 to 12/31/71 with one previously unreleased track.<br /><br />Disc 3 & 4 is the New Year's Eve show in it's entirety and labeled the soundboard mix. It's very close to the same setlist as the first two discs. Th e sound is identical to the first two discs.<br /><br />Disc 5 is what originally prompted me to buy the set. It is a DVD in 5.1 sound of the NYE performance. I thought I was getting a video performance. I guess I didn't read the details well enough. It is indeed the show in 5.1 and it sounds spectacular but there is no video just a photo montage.<br /><br />And that brings us to the book. The book has some nice photos and text but half is actually just the place holders for the discs.<br /><br />At a price point of $80+ I think I was expecting a little more. More variety and some video. Had this been priced at about $50, i would say absolutely get it. But unless you're a completist, I would pass on this and get Rock Of Ages.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I still have not not fully installed the unit. It got &#34;stuck&#34; in set up and took a lot of work to unstuck it. I have yet  to play anything on it. Maybe it's me I not very nerdly.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|One Hell of A Movie.............Worth watching. I bought the dvd after already seeing the movie on cable. I'd say thats a pretty good recommendation.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this novel and was interested in what would happen all the way through it.  I did not care for the ending, but had a lot of enjoyable hours reading anyway!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This started out as a miracle product. It not worth 10 cents. It will not show anything on you base computer unless it is actively being downloaded live from the internet as you are using it (so no computer file pictures or movies that are stored on your computer will appear on your TV). When you try to stream a movie live onto your TV, from your computer, it tell you it is doing this on a &#34;BETA TESTING APPLICATION&#34; and only &#34;Chugs&#34; the picture, a few seconds at a time. When I disconnect it and attach my old fashion 25 ' HD cable, from my laptop to the TV....Bingo ! I'm back to perfect reception again, with no chugging at all.<br /><br />  This product &#34;may&#34; be useful down the road, when they gets it out of the BETA stage of actual use, but for now, don't waste your money. Why Google released this unfinished product onto the market early is beyond me.<br /><br />  I had ordered a second one of these, on the release hype, before I found out what a POS they really are,  as there was a waiting line period. I canceled the my second order, I'm very glad there was a waiting period.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this sequel to Pillars of the Earth.  I love the complexity of the plot and character development, even when I hated the way things turned out at times.
B00B19G01C|3.0|This wasn't a bad movie, although it started slowly and took me a while to get into it. Don't expect anything new or earthshaking, but it delivers the standard chills pretty effectively.<br />I'm not going to give away any plot points here, but I will say that overall, the screenplay was acceptable, the direction sufficient, and the acting strong enough to keep the film going.<br />Oh, and the number of survivors was surprising for this type of movie...
0060594888|5.0|This book really hits a home run, giving you a blueprint for success. Jack Canfield really lays out a detailed plan on how anyone can achieve success no matter what their background by taking 100% responsibility for their life. The 64 principles outlined in the book were explained perfectly with great examples. Chapters were not too long or too brief. I read this book in about a week as I couldn't put it down, may have been shorter, hadn't I took time to take action on the principles that called for it. Very motivating. Highly recommend this book for anyone that wants to achieve their calling in life.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I had no great expectations for this film, so I wasn't disappointed. I'd even say that overall, I was amused...<br />The screenplay hit on most of the basic plot points, and offers an almost reasonable explanation of how the wizard got to Oz in the first place. What more could we ask? Well, maybe a bit more plot, some character development, and perhaps some more effective humor wouldn't have been out of place.<br />For the most part, it's an attractive film, fairly watchable, but the actors mostly tend to walk through it without offering much. I will say  that although I'm not especially a Mila Kunis fan, she brought more to her role than anyone else did to theirs; I'm thinking she practiced her cackle for hours...
B000WAEK0E|4.0|Mr. Morrison is still one of the best singer/songwriters ever. Good &#34;best of&#34; album for any collection.  A true legend.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|love it, i'm hooked, hated the last minute of the last episode, thinking to write to the writers and complain but don't know how, will still get sucked into the next season i'm sure.
079073639X|5.0|One of the movies where I'm glad I didn't pay attention to reviews. Sure, there were a few spots that could have been polished, but overall this film was great. Great actors and acting, great plot, and a pretty good pace. The story was great because it was so different and intriguing.
B002SS8S7E|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Action packed and thrilling.  Have seen it 4 times and never get tired of it. Wow.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|Francis Ford Coppola's Masterpiece has been restored and looks and sounds great  I would definitely recommend this to ANY movie buff.  Or I'll just &#34;make them an offer they don't refuse.&#34;
1781162646|5.0|I have a confession to make:  I'm not the world's biggest Stephen King fan.  Know what?  After reading this book, I'm sure a bigger fan now than I ever was before!  JOYLAND is a book that can cross many genres.  It could appeal to the romantic; to the mystery solver; the paranormal enthusiasts; and to the young adult and young at heart alike.<br /><br />It's the 1970's and college student and aspiring writer, Devin Jones, is in love with Wendy.  Wendy, not so much.  Devin decides to spend his summer working at Joyland Amusement Park in North Carolina where he meets a cast of characters more amusing and interesting than the amusement park itself!  Add to that cast of characters the Stephen King twist of an unsolved murder begging to be solved and things just got REALLY interesting in that small town.<br /><br />Linda Gray was murdered in the \\"Horror House\\".  Folks around town say that she still haunts that Joyland ride.  On a rare day off from work, Devin and his new friends, Erin and Tom (who also work at the park), decide to spend the day being visitors at the park rather than employees.  Their plan~~to ride through the \\"Horror House\\" and see if there is anything to the rumor that it is haunted.<br /><br />For one of the three friends, things just got very real.<br /><br />Determined to solve this mystery of Linda Gray's murder, and mend his broken heart, Devin stays on at Joyland as a full time employee after the \\"rubes\\" of summer have long gone and the park is closed.  The story unfolds as told to us from the Devin in years to come as he reflects upon that summer.  Oh that summer.<br /><br />My book club chose this book as our Summer Group Read and we had quite the spirited (no pun intended) discussion.  By all accounts, mine included, this book is Mr. King at quite possibly, his finest.<br /><br />I'm giving this book a 4.5 star rating.  And if anyone at all is reading this that has any influence with Mr. King whatsoever, how about a prequel to this book?  Please?  I'd love to know that back story of Linda Gray and her killer.e?  I'd love to know that back story of Linda Gray and her killer.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I liked the ending a lot.  I also am glad that the book continued where it left off in book 3
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Angel tablets, demon tablets, plans to slam the gates closed on heaven and hell.  An angel with an agenda and a grudge. Charlie, Crowley, and Kevin.  Winchesters being Winchestery.  What more could a person want?
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Another great season for Downton Abbey - love all the characters - they are well developed. I especially like Thomas - his character is so unpredictable.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fantastic graphics and challenging puzzles. I didn't want to stop playing. Can't wait for rooms 2. Well worth the price IMO. There are hints at each level, but you shouldn't need them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent show, very well done, great actors, setting, music, history. Very enjoyable from beginning to end. I show that everyone should watch
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey and can't wait for the new 4th season to start.  I would highly recommend it.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Watching Broadchurch is like pulling back the curtain into the private lives of everyone in the small town. See their good, bad, painful, and private times.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Changes made to rules for playing game make it less fun and more difficult to understand and play game well.  Used to be more fun!
B001EJGQTU|5.0|One of most memorable and chilling documentaries I've ever seen, highly recommended. I've recommended this movie to so many people, and been thanked every time. You won't regret watching this, it'll disturb you a bit and get you thinking, but after awhile you'll be thankful it did.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|So I got re-hired at seven eleven and I needed a way to ignore my \\"colleagues\\". I will not lie to you people, I swear on my monkey wife, Karen's life, this game is more awful than Wheel Of Fortune without Vanna. When I first started playing, Karen started screaming bloody murder about \\"paying taxes\\" and \\"keeping up with the mortgage\\", just the usual dumb stuff the ignorant primate usually complains about. Long story short, she pinched a massive loaf on my kindle, then threw it outside. Since my income level is lower than that of most ex-drug dealers and fourteen year olds, the new kindle was a HUGE purchase. I figured the first game on it should be memorable...it was. When I got to the first level I had a panic attack and urinated all over the couch because I was afraid I was trapped in. You can probably imagine it went downhill from there, so did my experience with the game. Basically, don't get this game, and don't marry a monkey both are poor decisions that a man would tie serious money for a chance to reevaluate at the time they were made.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|Great time killer and brain exerciser.  Price is most definitely right and download is a breeze.  Besides, it is fun!
B008JGSM6G|1.0|This game. I once worked for a school bus company repairing brake discs and I have never found anything more painful. Then I got married to my monkey wife, Karen, and the brake disc business seemed like a sweet deal. However, this game has made me wonder about everything. I played it so long and hard that my eyes had colorful lines on them. Oh wait, that was the bubble soap Karen poured into my pupils while I was sleeping because she thought I purposely cut the brake lines on her car. I was insulted, so I bought this game to get back at her and it was awful. Not only could I not see, but due to the fecal matter all over my kindle, I never could finish a line. I have been trying to explain to Karen how a toilet works for years. Apparently, in the rainforest they don't have toilets. Basically, that means to Karen that everything is her toilet. She pees on the sofa, counter, my sock drawer, and the printer. Number two is taken care of on anything that's mine: my baseball card collection, my work uniform, my toaster, my laptop, my mother (though my mother usually has it thrown at her), and worst of all, my kindle. The wreck less baboon makes it rain all over that thing, and I have had to buy multiple ones. As many of you may know, I work for seven eleven and make about as much as children in third world countries do, thus I cannot afford this many kindles. Really, all I'm trying to say is that the game is too hard for someone married to a creature that drinks it's urine.
1781162646|4.0|Got this book for my wife's Kindle.  She is a Stephen King fan. Momma liked it so I am happy.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The book stars out a bit slow but if you push through that it gets fabulous!!  It's only the first few chapters!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Excellent! Superb magnificent well-made realistic amazing wonder elegant truly exceptional and more powerful plots to see that will surprise you
1909313033|5.0|Very enjoyable read.  The author really pin points some of the characteristics and traits of the pug!  Well worth it.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Kept me entertain the entire time even though it was so long. I would hands down recommend this to a friend.
B0068THAGY|3.0|I don't know what I was expecting, but it was a fun movie to watch lol! I didn't love the ending because it was kind of weird and the category shouldn't have been under horror since it wasn't scary. It was cool overall though and I really like the train crash scene!!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|just watched this , really cute for kids & tweens.... but i lost interest quick. truly a kids flick. rent it for your ankle biters !
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I knew nothing about the book before I started reading it and fell in love with it right from chapter one.
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|The visuals + the great M83 score are what saved this movie for me. I found the film repetitive and the story pretty choppy. But the music... solid!
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|Nice game. I think the characters are cutely done and music is fine. Sometimes its difficult to score a higher rating even in lower levels
B00DJ6KYWQ|5.0|As ever, Frederick Forsyth writes of fictional  happenings which seem to have been taken straight from the front page of today's newspaper.  The mystery woven around the hunt for the radical Islamic preacher smacks so much of news items we have become accustomed to hearing.  I became thoroughly involved in the mystery and in the individual characters, which were all well drawn and well rounded.  Thoroughly recommend it as a not so escapist read to anyone interested in today's world events.
0857680986|5.0|Lots of information and visual examples. It give you the insights for figure drawing in any perspective. Composition, drawing the face, body and beyond. Highly recommended.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|even i cringed during the more graphic stuff, a much much better version than Sly's, but can't trash it too much cuz without Stalone's Dredd Karel Urban wouldn't have gotten the chance to one up him
B0016MOWP0|5.0|This movie is excellent. Keanu and Swayze balling. I wish they wouldn't remake something that got it so right the first time around, but they will.
0783225482|5.0|Even my kids love this movie! This is a great movie & very funny. My teenage daughter even showed it to her friends!
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|The controls are very wonky. It says you can turn off the auto accelerate but it still accelerates and brakes after you change it. It only looks nice, that's all it has going for it.
0694003611|5.0|My kids enjoy this book & it's one of our favorites to read at bedtime. It also helped teaching my daughter to read & we would read it to each other.
B00A285OOW|5.0|This is her latest book in the series and her first person mode continues to enthrall the reader. Her prose is beautiful. It continues the series and advances the history line that clearly will lead to her next book. It will be even more enjoyable if one reads her earlier books in the series as the characters are intertwined in each of her books. If you have any knowledge of England's history you will enjoy all her  books even more. Her writing style beings you close to her characters. Almost like looking over their shoulders. I did not want to put this book down.
B001GQACGO|5.0|I love this cd & love Beyonce's music. I would listen to this on my commute to & from work. It helped me deal with traffic in a good way!
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|This is just like playing the table game I played in the arcade in the 80's.it is fun to play and the graphics are great.
0060254920|5.0|My kids love this book & love the movie. I was so excited when we got this book & couldn't wait to read it to my kids.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun but should make it where you can win more gems more often but all in all it is Avery fun game
B007EECSFA|5.0|Another winner from Kate Morton.  I love her stories, they aren't the same cookie cutter novels where the characters and locations change.  Keeps you guessing until the end!
B008469DGY|4.0|Its not a complete golf game, more like a driving range for your fingers.  But it works smoothly, the graphics are nice on my Note 10.1, and its fun.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This should be on everyone's must read list.  If everyone in the world read this book I believe the world would be a better place!
B0030SZ2D4|5.0|I didn't even know this film existed until a friend told me about it and said we had to see it before the new Riddick came out.  And I'm so glad we did.  Part of this film gets referenced in the new one!  I thought this one was great - better than &#34;Chronicles&#34;.  It's dark and cool and has some cool surprises.  By-the-way, I like the new one a lot too.  :o)
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book. I fell in love with the characters, even with their dysfunctions. I will recommend it to anyone.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|My wife and I have seen this one a bunch of times and it's funny every time.  Great characters and ridiculous situations (Jennifer Aniston - are you kidding me?!?!?).  If you haven't seen it and like to laugh, just do it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Not bad for the price but it is not the end all solution to casting all of your computer based apps.  Doesn't work with Amazon prime (unless you kludge with Chrome) and has issues with Chrome running on an iPad.
B003YVCJQ0|5.0|This one has it all. I just saw it for the first time and all I thought of afterwards was what the heck was I waiting for?  Brilliant.
0307744434|3.0|Whoever wrote the blurb for Night Circus did the book a disservice by creating expectations in the reader which are never met.  The book is slow, with no escalation and the promised duel is never delivered upon.  Nothing much happens after the beginning until the very end.  The end, when it eventually comes is clumsily delivered.  The reader is told the whole thing has been about a battle between good and evil, although that is not evident throughout the book, and it's impossible to discern that any character is any less good or more evil than any other.  Nevertheless,it is written very prettily. There is magic on every page and the imagery is frequently wonderful, but the short chapters make it difficult to become immersed in the story.
B000H4TX9I|4.0|Why this would be cancelled and some of the crap that is on is allowed to stay is a mystery.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|Awesome movie! The kids love to watch it over and over again. I have e to say that I love it too
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This book is all about being grateful for everything you have now. I loved all of the daily activites you had to do and I continue to practice other things this book suggested. It's a good reminder to stop and say &#34;Thank you&#34; for what you have.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I absolutely love these stickers!! We decorated our living room and bathroom with them - the little jewels that come with it stay on well too (except if the wall in the bathroom gets moist from showering) but these are adorable and definitely brighten up the room! Gotta love disney!
B0097BY3K6|5.0|Heard the music on a PBS special. Cd is even better than the show! David Garrett is an awesome musician!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this app! It makes texting super fast and easy! The best part is when it has memorized my most used words and I just click on the word from the word bank. I would recommend this keyboard app to anyone who wants to text fast!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Great writing, acting and story.  Great performances by Claire Danes, Damian Lewis and the rest.  I saw the first two episodes for free on DISH and I was hooked and started streaming episodes from Amazon.
B00D1X0576|2.0|IT IS TESTING SOMETHING BUT NOT INTERNET.<br /><br />Recommend as a guide, develop a &#34;Speed Test&#34; by Ipad/ipod.for Amazon customers.(kindle) netbook etc.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I love my new case. I now fell that my phone is secure. I wish the color was teal instead of pink but hey, a case is a case!
B005U9REU0|5.0|Great movie for kids or the adult with an active imagination! This is one of my favorites and all our kids still love the movie. One of David Bowie's best performances.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|this is a movie i liked.  I do not want to write more but you force me to write bad
159413586X|1.0|I did not want a LARGE PRINT edition, which this one is.  I have sent it back, asking for a credit card payment return, or credit to my account, and am waiting to hear back from the seller.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|I really do not want to comment.  I was a movie and we liked it  what can i say more
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|This was by far the strangest book I have ever read. And I have read lots of books. It was hard to keep up with because it was just so bizarre. I didn't like that it never really gave an explanation for these strange events.
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|too much information in too little film, and when a film spends that much time explaining it isn't enteraining.  too many gaps, too many people who figure out one thing but miss the very obvious.  the sound bringing all the zombies to the wall, but the helicopter did not get them to move away, it's very loud?  injecting a lethal amound of meningitis and then walking away?  why did he suddenly smell wrong?  what about gout?  or a broken finger?  the illness had to be a virus, how did it modify the dead to be amblitory and able to hear and smell if a person was healthy or not?  a mini series would have been a better venue.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app a few days ago and I love it!it has high quality stuff and fancy graphics.I love it
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|what a dog of a movie.  it made no real sense and the ending was just wierd.  three more words.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really love minion rush because it it entertaining and fun it. I rate this app very good. Thank you for this app.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I was not happy with the ending of the movie, how the scam falls appart and so forth.  the lead up to the end was great, but I think some re-writing to add a little more intellectual, without detracting from the graphic violence and blood.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Interesting twist, but there were several 'impossible situations' where my suspension of disbelief was really challenged. Worth a watch. I am glad I saw it, but probably won't see it again anytime in the next century :)
B000007T1M|5.0|Awesome CD! Been a fan of SOAD since Toxicity, I just never got around to listening to this one. Highly recommend this to anyone who has not heard it.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Downloaded this out of curiosity when my teenager brought it my attention.  Was immediately hooked. I'm not a gamer, but this is challenging and fun.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|Love anything by Luke Bryan.  Enjoyed this on a very long trip!  I don't usually listen to CDs in my car but I love this one.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Iliked the entire book.<br />We could all learn to be kinder than required by everyday standards.  It could influence the world to be a better place.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This movie is great on two levels, it brings light to some very true issues many people struggle with on a daily basis.  Yet it does so in a manner that adds some humor to it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I just love this app. I can make colleges, and custom pictures. I really like the social art thing but there's a problem with submitting pictures o to my profile. Please fix
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This had comedy and action.  There were lots of guns and explosions, a little spy plot, funny moments, and even a little weird romance.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Might be good for a kid but I was looking for something more like the original. A waste of my time.
B003XDUCIG|5.0|Geek is a nice word for nerd, and the title does not lie. It's a seriously good book though, a wealth of knowledge, technique and recipes. Get it, read it and you will forever be a better cook.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so so fun and keeps me entertained all day every day I love my horse and omg it teaches you how to care for a horse live or not it is very life learning esspecialy great for animal lovers
B00026ZG10|1.0|DVD ITSELF has so many scratches I won't bother trying to count them, much less try playing it on my expensive dvd player.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|Rick Rubin seems to help some artists more than others. He helped here with ZZ Top. This whole collection is fiery and raw, the kind of sound that fueled the ZZ Top albums of the seventies that had us all playing air guitar. There's not a weak song in the bunch but the style mix no doubt will have listeners thinking some songs are better than others. Nothing unusual there.<br /><br />Some have complained about the over-compressed mix. So I compared the vinyl version and the MP3 version. There's no doubt the MP3 version sounds compressed. Of course, most modern music is over-compressed because of the volume wars. (I can't listen to Black Eyed Peas for more than 10 minutes because the volume is so relentlessly high at all times.)<br /><br />The vinyl, on the other hand, is lively, with lots of dynamic range and transients. I can clearly hear Billy's shredded cords of the 'I've been drinking whiskey and smoking' kind, and clicks on guitar strings and studio sounds. I wonder if the mastering was different for vinyl; frankly it sounds awesome. Billy's guitar stands out so clearly it's like his amp is in my room.<br /><br />One note: the vinyl is an audiophile-quality 180 gram pressing, but it's actually a 45 RPM album! There's a new one for me. It's two albums with about three songs on each side. I did not notice the 45-RPM feature and it sounded mighty weird at 33. Fortunately my turntable's belt can be moved to a different setting for 45 speed. But buyer beware on this one. Folks with 33 RPM only turntables are out of luck.<br /><br />UPDATE: I listened to the full vinyl album and I think it represents a state of the art for quality sound. Kudos to Rick Rubin and the mastering team for this one. Every instrument stands out clearly on a wide sound stage, nothing muddled.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Safe for kids. Best for kids in elementary and middle school, under 5 would probably be too young to follow all major themes. Teachable historical concepts. Rich in patriotism. Mature enough for all ages. Lacking in over the top violence for those blood thirsty viewers who like gratuitous violence. Handsome male star +  attractive female love interest with no need for a birds and the bees talk with your kids is the type of old fashioned romance that works and which more of its needed.  Great for families and date nights. Not for voyeurs.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|During the movie, my wife and I turned to each other at about the same time and said &#34;we need to get this soundtrack!&#34;. It's great!
B005544TRQ|5.0|It has everything a person could want in a show: a great cast and a good story. Try one episode and you'll be hooked.
B00BWWS81S|5.0|Very thoughtful and introspective cd.  I've been a fan for years, but feel this is some of her best work to date.  It is one of those personal cds I listen to with headphones.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I came to this show expecting pulp entertainment, and emerged from my cave three days later having watched the whole thing in one go.  Addicting to the extreme and plenty entertaining on the rewatch.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I like it a lot. It would be nicer if it played a bit faster but that is my only complaint about the game play. My only issue with the app is it kills your battery, keep your charger close if you are going to play more than a few games.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|Eva's haunting narrative will stay with you long after you put the book down.  Kevin is a fascinating character, in all of his horror, and it takes a special kind of author to make the reader sympathize with a murderer.  Shriver does it effortlessly.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Jenji Kohan has done it again! A protagonist I wanted to identify with but her privilege make it difficult. Yet the cast if supporting characters really do make me want to know more about them.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Another classic worthy of the 80s.  Don't let the chick-flick-y themes throw you - this is a smart, hilarious little film.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I enjoy every song on this c/d. Having just seen him in concert, it brings back the memories. Love, love it!
B0019TYQ38|5.0|Great story with fantastic scenery and great actors! I've watched it several times now.  Really depicts this period of time.
B007HO392S|5.0|All the sounds are powerful and great! Love all the songs. Highly recommend this cd to anyone that even just &#34;likes&#34; Carrie Underwood, you won't be disappointed.
B0081SRJSY|3.0|It's entartaining but I don't like the lack of online multiplayer game. Playing against the CPU is quite boring and easy to win if you focus on your castles.
B0054EU0H0|3.0|Good quality, but not shaped properly for the D3200 even though it comes up in a search. The LCD screen on the D3200 has 4 rounded corners, where these screen protectors have 2 rounded corners and 2 square ones, plus the screen protector is just slightly too big. In fairness, the packaging does say it fits the D3100 and makes no mention of the D3200.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|It did give me gas though.but Madonna is the s***. Twerk it honey! Work that old thing OUT girl!!!!!! Woop woop
B00EI6E17A|4.0|Musically Awesome... Lyrically okay.<br />What else is there to say? It's a wonderfully arrogant piece.<br />Perhaps, Lady G is a little unsure of herself so she's attacking her critics before they tear her apart.<br />But if all the grooves for art pop are as industrial and tasty as this tid-bit. She's got nothing to worry about.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Nice game , a very good and cool game to play to keep you busy while waiting for somebody or while waiting for the bus or train on a weekend schedule .
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This is no work of art, but it is fun to watch. Karl urban does a good job. I say it's worth watching, probably not a buy, just rent.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Was a quick moving book. Loved the &#34;diary&#34; narrative aspect. It was had a refreshing twist and its a book I could read again and again!
B005DNPKSQ|2.0|All of Carreys movies during this time were not very good. He seemed to forget why he was a star and started making bad movies. It might be worth watching if you don't have much else to do, but not really. I am shocked that people actually believe this is a good movie. Maybe I missed something, like a point to watching it.
B0087HT36U|4.0|good game but is very short they need more levels for increase the game experience. anyway is very funny and in some ocations very addictive
B0036FYO12|5.0|While I love Redford enough to bear his children, I found myself mesmerized by Ms. Dunaway's performance.  The tight pace made this movie one that I watched from the edge of my seat. I kept finding myself leaning in toward the tube. Wow!
B000286S8S|5.0|This is a great collection of all Van Halen music, real classics of all times, good remastered versions of classic and newer  themes, from David Lee to Sammy,  a must have!<br />Really recomend this one...
B00004CZN9|2.0|You need to live in areas, beyond North America, to watch this film. There are things called \\"region codes\\" on every dvd. This movie carries one region code, that isn't universal. Yes, most DVDs are universal. Unless you can manually change your \\"region code\\" on your player, you can't watch it in North America. Know what you are buying, when it comes to DVDs. Learned this one the hard way.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Somewhat tedious, but overall the excellent read I have come to expect of Martin. The cliffhanger at the end of a chapter,<br />where one of the main characters either dies or is about to die, then turns up alive in a later chapter is getting kind of old,<br />though. Nonetheless, eagerly awaiting the next book in this saga.
030758836X|1.0|This is a TERRIBLE book. When you read a book like this you have to go do something good to try and remove the YUCK wrapped around your head in an attempt to remove it.\\" Simple and pure. When I finish a book and it leaves lingering feelings of I now have to climb out of muck there is something horrible wrong. Why spend time reading such negative disgusting garbage. Ask yourself the question, \\"Do I want to read something that is powerfully positive or powerfully negative.\\" If it is negative you want this is the book for you. You could read this and watch the recent shootings at the same time for an extra dose of feel good. After I started reading and figured out the agenda (emotional spiral downward)  of the book I skimmed it then discarded it.
B00DMEQP46|5.0|In a lot of ways, this album seems to avoid song writing. Traditional song writing really does take a back seat to the luscious, Eno-esque soundscapes. Strangely distorted guitars and eerie synth harmonies shine, more often than not, backed by huge drums which create a soundscape of their own. If you're looking for pop tinged psychedlia, then you will probably be disappointed, because this is not a record like Oracular Spectacular or even Congratulations for that matter. That's not to say that &#34;MGMT&#34; is not psychedellic; it is. But it's more like the post 60's/late 70's style stuff. It sounds like the freakish love child of &#34;Simon & Garfunkel&#34; and &#34;Berlin era&#34; David Bowie. That's why I love this album. MGMT will take a few listens to sink in, but the more it does, the more familiar you will feel with the sounds. Not every moment is great on this record, however the good moments more than make up for the lulls.<br /><br />Standout tracks: Your Life Is A Lie, Plenty Of Girls In The Sea, Introspection
0694003611|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend and it is so easy to read and our LO know when we read &#34;Goodnight Moon&#34;, it time for bed. Great way to start your kids on their reading habits.
B005544V6A|5.0|Enjoy this show time after time, over and over again and again.  Never get tired of any of the episodes, ever
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|Very funny but action packed.  Knowing Bruce Willis is in the movie made it and all the other stars, made the purchase worth it.
1452101248|5.0|Love it.  Who would of thought vegetarian dishes could be so good.  You will impress yourself and your friends.  But it.
1451695195|5.0|I appreciated the author's sincere efforts to describe and chronicle his after-life experiences and I believe he was being honest with his story. It gives one hope and peace in their life to believe that life continues after death and that we will see our loved ones again. I liked this book very much.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|This was a very watchable film. A cross between Huck Finn and the earlier film &#34;Whistle Down the Wind&#34; starring Haley Mills. The acting was first class and the story was well scripted
B00271DNP4|5.0|This is where things start getting dark the light moments are not as . The movie down loaded and play back was really really good.
B00C061I1M|5.0|Absolutely unique and captivating!  Valerie's one of a kind style is spot on.  Her writings and transition to music is mesmerizing.  Her voice just carries me away!
B005UG542S|5.0|How can you not love Harry Potter.  The movie down loaded and play back was really really good. Will watch again.
B001N26GFM|5.0|How two boys from different cultures and backgrounds found friendship in a time of evil, hate, horror; both of them innocent of the circumstances which brought them together is a most enlightening story.  It's one that everyone should pay attention to and learn from it.
