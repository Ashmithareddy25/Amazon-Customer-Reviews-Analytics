B004QZ9PLU|1.0|Every time after I finish a Nicholas Sparks book I swear to myself this is the last time I'll read one of his books.  This time I mean it.  I can't take any more sappy, unrealistic endings.  The story line in The Best of Me was one of his worse.  It was silly from the beginning...something that a love sick teen would write in her diary.  There's very little reality in this story.  No normal man is never going to go on another date and never have sex again because he lost his first love at the ripe old age of 18.  Dawson's mysterious ghost man and Tuck's visions of his dead wife did nothing to save this poorly written storyline. They just made it more ridiculous. The storyline and characters had no depth and never came to life for me.  Don't waste your time or money on this book.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Ignore the reviews complaining about the ads. I'll put up with ONE page listing the companies other games when they give it away for free. There are no ads in the game.  I've played this game on the PC, and even bought the second version. On my Acer tablet, the program is almost identical to the PC experience apart from the easier selection via touch.o
B0067Q42BY|3.0|The approach is very well organized and made, however it tends to freeze for a few seconds every few moves, which is kind of annoying.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|popcap needs to update this to work on everyones galaxy nexus! used to play all the time on my Droid x and now I cant play at all :(
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoyed playing it. I definitely recommend it to other people who enjoy mahjong. I actually have two of them and can't wait to play the other one too.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is really fun totally worth it great game going nuts is my favorite game by far. really awsome
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Easily the best mahjong app I've ever played. Fluid, smooth yet challenging gameplay. I'm very pleased here. Will be very interested in seeing what other games G5 produce.
0385534639|4.0|This book was a rare find, the idea of the story was very unique, and I doubt there will ever be another book like it. A mixture of fantasy and romance, The Night Circus transports you to another realm where the unbelievable and impossible become a reality. A compelling game of magic and illusion bring together a diverse and unusual group of people, creating the night circus, an otherwise unheard of venue that has a loyal following. The \\"game\\" of illusion turns into a love story for Marco and Celia, who find their love will be tragic for both of them.<br />The author of this book creates such deep, wonderful characters that by the end of the novel you will feel like you have to say goodbye to good friends. While reading this book I felt like I was there in the late 1800's experiencing each venue of the circus for myself. The love story in this book is nothing short of magical, written in a way never experienced previously, with the characters creating small worlds of magic and illusion, seeping their intense love into each and every aspect.<br />I enjoyed this book immensely but there were a few things I wish could have been a little different, which is why I gave the book only 4 stars. I found that I was at least half way through the book before Celia and Marco's relationship really came to life. I think it could have been much more than it was if it had been incorporated into the story earlier on. A lot of the magical aspects of the book, such as the rules of the game and how the two players were completely bound to it with no way out was kind of hard to follow. I understood enough to appreciate the importance of it, and I believe that the vagueness was actually part of the story, but I still felt like I couldn't grasp the true meaning. And last but not least, the ending of story wasn't very satisfying and it left me slightly confused.<br />All in all I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good fairy tale, it's a very enjoyable read and I was sad when I read the last page and stored the book on my book shelf. Enjoy!the last page and stored the book on my book shelf. Enjoy!

0785135863|5.0|I've read most of the graphic novel adaptations of Card's work, and at first I was doubtful of how well the format could adapt a work as complex and nuanced as Speaker for the Dead, which is far less action-packed and more philosophical than Ender's Game and other works. I was a little bit let down by Formic Wars: Burning Earth as I felt it didn't have the sort of emotional impact that Card's Ender series always has, and I was concerned that this impact would be lessened in this new version of Speaker. My fears were quickly put to rest, though - this graphic novel does a remarkable job of conveying everything that's meaningful in the original book. I was very impressed by how well the incredibly lengthy dialogue of the book was condensed into the most bare-bones relevancy suited for a graphic novel. It didn't feel nearly as rushed as I was expecting, nor did it leave out any of the important plot elements. Jane, Marcos, and all of Novinha's children were present and all of their personalities were as distinct and memorable as they are in the book (and all of the human characters, especially Ender, were drawn perfectly and totally true to how I envisioned the characters). The story and the characters were all certainly streamlined, but it was about as good as I could have expected in a graphic novel.<br /><br />My only real critique of the work is that Lusitania itself was too earth-like and the aliens too anthropomorphized. The planet's environments were not drawn in a way that came across as a convincing alien world, especially the trees, which looked basically indistinguishable from earth trees. The Pequeninos were somewhat better, as they didn't look exactly like pigs as I was worried they would, but their expressions and mannerisms still came across as far more humanlike than they did in the book. It's a very minor quibble, though, as I understand that a certain amount of familiarity in appearance is necessary for human readers to identify with the characters. All in all, this is definitely my favorite of Card's graphic novel adaptations so far, and is well deserving of five stars.this is definitely my favorite of Card's graphic novel adaptations so far, and is well deserving of five stars.

B004EPZ08O|4.0|This review is based upon the \\"Rental\\" copy. No Bonuses.<br /> Running time: 91 mins. Rated \\"R\\".<br /><br /> This is the fifth movie in the series, but is actually a prequel to the first movie, Final Destination (2000).<br /><br />  Tony Todd, from Final Destination (2000) and Final Destination 2 (2003), returns as \\"William Bludworth\\".<br /><br />  A group of office workers are going on a retreat. The tight boss, Dennis Lapman (David Koechner) doesn't talk nice to anyone. He has Peter (Miles Fisher) organizing the bus trip with nice guy, Sam (Nicholas D'Agosto), as his assistant to make sure everyone gets on board the bus on time. Peter puts the pressure on Sam that he will be fired if he doesn't do his job right for Dennis.<br /> Sam's girlfriend, Molly, (Emma Bell) is also in the bus group and just told him they are not working out. As Sam rushes Nathan (Arlen Escarpeta) onto the bus, he reads on the steps, \\"Watch Your Step\\".<br />  Sam notices construction work being done on the bridge the bus is traveling on. Their is a big square hole to the right. A shadow passes over him inside the bus. Sam gets a strange feeling. The bus stops. He cuts his finger on the seat. The video tv becomes snowy. Their is a tremor. The bridge road begins to crack and collapses into the water below.<br />  How will this group survive the fate that awaits them.  This is just one incident in a series of events about to happen.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Ellen Wroe, Jacqueline MacInnes Wood, P.J. Byrne, Courtney B. Vance, Brent Stait.<br /><br />Shown in squeezy widescreen.<br /><br />Option of language and subtitles in English, Spanish, French.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0780631684 Final Destination (New Line Platinum Series)]] (2000).<br />[[ASIN:B00005JLZK Final Destination 2]] (2003).<br />[[ASIN:B000FC2HRW Final Destination 3 (Full Screen 2-Disc Special Edition)]] (2006).<br />[[ASIN:B001GCUO4S The Final Destination]] (Final Destination 4 3D) (2009).<br />[[ASIN:B004EPZ08O Final Destination 5 (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] 3D (2011).5 (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] 3D (2011).
B0063IH60K|3.0|Started out as a great app, and I didn't mind the ads, but now occasionally it hijacks my phone and starts BLASTING a video in my face when I least expect it. Some can be stopped by hitting the back button twice, some can't and you have to look for the tiny x on the screen to stop the noise. Unacceptable.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app. great for the road and party's. I love it. my bf has the same app. this is a must have app. buy it today.

B005723JSQ|5.0|Better than the shopaholic series!  I've Got Your Number is the best stand alone book that I have read in along time.  The book pulls you,in from the beginning and gets better with every turn of the page.  Definitely a must read!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these games they are so much fun and very entertaining i request you install it for lots of fun with your friends and family
B006ON41FC|5.0|this going nuts game is fun and easy enough for kids to play but complicated enough for adults to plat .
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is a good and reliable app. You don't need Internet, which is good for me because I travel a lot. Basicly I love this app and if you like solitaire, you will like this app.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|First of all, I don't consider a page showing games from the same developer as 'ads' so giving this beautiful game a low rating for that is asinine.<br /><br />The tutorial also included a little story setting up the game so it was relatively painless and very brief.  Once I got into the game itself, there are many options to choose from such as tile appearance, background and music.  The gameplay was smooth, the hint system fast and the graphics themselves very attractive.  This is one of the best looking mahjong games I've ever played and I was thrilled to get it for free when it was offered as app of the day.<br /><br />I'm playing it on a Kindle Fire and I haven't had any glitches yet.  Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome I realty like it fun friend got me hooked realy good game to play better than the single games that don't have a lot.of.games
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like these games they are fun and challenging. this is one of the better free apps I have downloaded. my kids love playing any of these and it keeps em busy and outran my hair.  I definately reccomend this app.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its annoying at times cause I find it extremely difficult to pass some of the stouid games. it made me mad

B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game I ever bought ,I love this game because it is so fun and exiting and there is so many different games and there all so fun.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|wasn't expecting the story. nice change from the basic game. haven't done a lot of playing yet, but like it Already.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game. Keeps you thinking with planning a strategy for your next move. The background music is also relaxing.  You can accumulate hints along the way to use on some of the more difficult levels.
B001D8W7CW|4.0|This is a real classic, with a number of actors and actresses that were to become very famous later on.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I never knew... what the dark side of the moon looks like - or that the moon rotates like a steering wheel. Without even trying, you can have so much fun and learn a lot about our nearest neighbor. You have to try \\"cheese mode\\" if your feeling hungry. Once your done with the moon, then you can play with your own galaxy with [[ASIN:B006E4QCXU Gravilux]].
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Fun enough to keep me coming back, animated well enough to keep my preschoolers entertained. Great game that isn't by Zynga.
B005NQ5LQ4|1.0|Normally I would have given this a 5 star rating, since I own the series, but I received one of the videos with NO SUB TITLES, and NO ENGLISH at all, it was all in Chinese, which from an action and story perspective was great, because it really filled in some background and was great to watch, but with out the subtitles it was useless to me to really follow.  I usually watch the movie reading subtitles first, then I play the movie again to really watch the action....This whole thing is really distracting and upsetting that no one is willing to step up to fix this issue.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It's like being part of an adventure story, and the mahjong levels aren't too easy, nor are they unnecessarily difficult!
B004GJDQT8|1.0|This app did not work for my Visio VTAB1008.  I could not even get it to launch at all.  The screen became dark then would exit out.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game in history I love it I would play the game all day.I love all of the old games
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I am taking the book's advice and reading it again.... thought it was simple and straight forward... for those who have faith... it makes all the sense in the world.... I have read several books of this nature and found this one helped to unlock some blocks I had..... BTW.... it works... not the book... but the mindset that this and other books like this talk about... doubters will always say it is hogwash but I used to be one of them...  Worth the cost... and will pay so much more in dividends when you follow a faith driven purpose and life... Best of luck..!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I was worried since I had no idea how to play Mahjong, but this game teaches you how to play, so don't let that scare you away.  Great graphics, interesting story, good music all help set the exotic environments where the plot takes you.
1594203334|5.0|My husband and I are expecting twins. A couple of weeks ago he saw an article about this book and sent it to me; we were both intrigued.  I read the book in two days - couldn't put it down. It is a huge concern that our children not be a two of the thousands of spoiled, entitled children and (now) adults we see so often these days.  It was marvelous to hear that there is a dedicated movement striving to do the same.  While I don't necessarily agree with everything I read about the french culture Mrs. Druckerman describes (breastfeeding is not considered to be very important to a child's health) and don't exactly believe all of the hype about free government health care, I did find many things useful in this book which I hope to apply to raising our own children. Among others, the Pause, Big Eyes, and the Eating Schedule are all wonderful ideas and I hope we can make them work in our home.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|Who would have expected such a fun computer-animated movie would come from somewhere other than Pixar or Dreamworks?  This movie is well-written, heartwarming, funny, has an excellent cast, and does a great job of putting the \\"minions\\" in just the right place to break the story into ideal pieces.  Lots of fun, and even more fun in 3D!
B0067Q42BY|1.0|this app stinks no one should buy this app. I got this app as the free app of the day so glad it was. I don't get the game. I don't even understand it terrible terrible game
B004GHBQCE|5.0|I have loved Johnny Cash's music for a very long time, from the gospel to the country to the silly.  I have always felt he used his music to convey his deep sense of conscious and his connection to others' condition.  Think about Man in Black, San Quentin, Ira Hayes and too many others.  The Man Comes Around seems to be the culmination of decades of his earnest humanitarianism and genuine Christian concerns towards others.  It is one of the most emotionally intense recordings I have ever experienced, in part because I believe him.  The American Recordings and this album in particular are a fitting capstone to his brilliant life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My husband is really good at hand eye coordination, so he loves the oil field game. He is addicted to geating the points. I personally love the fun of the games!!
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I love all the books that Stead has wrote, but this one by far has won my heart. I loved every second of the book, from all the sad and discoraging parts to the exciting and adventure filled parts. This book was a real page turner, and it teaches people about life and of course, friendship.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|So many knife factories grind their bevels at the wrong angle. Something like 45-50 degrees. The result is that a proper sharpening angle of 40 degrees will not even TOUCH the cutting edge until after several hours' worth of work. Most folks will just wonder why their knives aren't getting sharp and assume either the product is a piece of junk, or they're doing something wrong.<br /><br />This is where this simple little guy comes in: Stage 1 is a couple of carbide blocks. Pull the badly ground knife through these a few times, and it literally slices off little strips of steel from the blade, and what is left is at the correct 30 degree angle. (though it is coarse) Then, polish it up with the coarse ceramic stones. At this point, you will be left with a reasonably durable and very sharp edge.<br /><br />If you want to finish it properly, take the knife over to your Spyderco Sharpmaker and then go through the steps to hone the 40 degree edge that is at the tip of the 30 degree one you just made.<br /><br />Everything else has no doubt been pointed out by the other 400+ reviewers, so I will leave it at that. Even to someone who really knows his stuff; knows the theory and method to execute a proper double bevel edge, this little guy is a real time-saver.<br /><br />The fold out rod is not  that great. The diamond dust seems to fall right off. Don't buy it for that feature.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can not explain in words how this book has effected me. I have read this book numerous times, along with listning to it on an audible. But this book never fails to grip my heart every time I read it. The two young &#34;lovers&#34; Peeta and Katniss are just unexpected and their journey with the Capitol is breathtaking. Katniss in  my opinion is a bit too tempered but is smart, witty, courageous, and lovable. Peeta is a easy one. As you go through to the next book, he is a real sweetheart, always loyal to Katniss. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Super fun and addicting game. I love this game so much. I hope they come.out with another one like that.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is very fun and quite addicting. Has a few bugs which slow it down sometimes, and keeps bugging you to write a review everytime you play. Other than this, great game!

B000JQUZCI|5.0|I normally don't like books that are written in epistolary format, but Frankenstein is an exception for me. The book manages to squeeze a lot of pathos out of the viewer for the 'horrid' monster. And even for today's audience's, there are portions of it that are as nail-biting as a thriller. I highly recommend this.
B005UKJX4E|2.0|Not sure what to think of this. The cinematography was really good, but the script was really disjointed. It might have been easier to like if it were not for arguably the WORST job of sound mixing in the history of the film industry. Trying to hear the whispers behind the music was nearly impossible. Without knowing what was said, the ability to join together the various segments was lost. I think the only reason this film got a nomination for best picture was to make The Descendant look better.
B006OV7S1I|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. The casting was good, the pace of the movie was good, as were the general theme and construction. The conclusion of the movie was a problem for me and I think it will be for the average viewers as well. If you are looking for film where the loose ends are tied up and there's some sense of resolution you aren't going to find it in Martha Macey May Marlene.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|pretty cool game.  I'm enjoying it. I like it so far. hope I don't zip through it as quickly as the other g5 games.
B0035G02MW|1.0|My first one-star review!<br /><br />I cannot believe an author of so many 'traditionally' published books, by which we all are led to understand 'approved', 'of high quality', 'unmissable' even, can write such tedium! It may seem harsh, because the mere fact that someone manages to take a novel through to an end of sorts should, at the very least, receive some recognition. Well, that's the one star I managed to stretch to! And it's published by Penguin! What were you thinking, guys? Authors like these are commercial suicide - no wonder you can't afford the staff and time necessary to uncover new talent!<br /><br />To summarise: long, awkwardly-constructed sentences, interminable paragraphs that often stretch longer than a page, bland descriptive and sparse dialogue weigh too heavily to save what could have been a moving, emotional journey through late adulthood. Pity. I've read and reviewed much more readable self-published authors - you know, the kind Penguin wouldn't waste a look at!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app.  I really like being able to switch from different versions while reading a piece of scripture. I haven't tried the devotionals yet but plan on doing so soon.
1594203059|3.0|Mr. Ferguson has written quite good books, such as \\"The Ascent of Money\\", on the role of finance in the ascent of capitalism. I found this one rather disappointing.  Some of the chapters seem quite unfocused and lacking structure. E.g., \\"medicine\\" where one would expect Mr. Ferguson to explain how medical science would have contributed to the West's rise to preeminence, turns out be mostly a fierce attack on French and especially German colonization (regardless of this being fair or not, that's not the main point). \\"Property\\" turns out to be a demonstration of the superiority of the model of English colonization of North America over Spanish and Portuguese colonization of South America. But then, one could ask, even if inferior to English colonization, didn't the Spanish and the Portuguese also manage to dominate the native populations, which was the development that required demonstration in the first place? Also, I believe that Mr. Ferguson ought to have referred to the broader issue of the rule of law, instead of the narrower notion of property, no matter how important it is.  Moreover, the book is based on a wrong premise: i.e., that somehow superior skills (or \\"apps\\", as the author calls them) explain the fact that some civilizations or political units dominate others. Should we then conclude that the rule of Mongol civilization was due to its superior skills? Id. with regard to the collapse of the Roman Empire? Or to the rule of the USSR over Eastern and parts of Central Europe? All due to superior political and technological \\"apps\\"?
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is a hilarious game that many people like or should like me and my sister both love this game so those of you who don't have this game go out and buy you won't regret it.

B004MGMJ3E|3.0|My listening experience with Panda Bear follows a very predictable pattern. I'm digging the sound during the first track I listen to (which may or may not be \\"You Can Count on Me\\"). The second one is usually cool too. Once the third track starts up, I'm starting to feel that I've had too much of a good thing. If I make it to a fourth track, chances are I'm going to move onto to something else before it's over. Now, if I come back to that same track the next day, I'll be digging the sound again.  I attribute my saturation point for Panda Bear music to the repetitive elements in several tracks and the highly produced vocals. The echo effect is interesting at first, but the novelty erodes quickly as its used again and again.  Tomboy tracks are a great addition to a playlist and it's a good album to have going if your player is set to shuffle.
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|Wow !!!! Like the other reviews say,a man starts having dreams & visions of a \\"storm of all storms\\".The affect of the nightmarish dreams and visions(which no one else see's but him)strains his sanity,marriage,and job.Is he crazy or will his dreams come true ?? Great acting on all parts,others have said it was slow,I found it riviting,edge of my seat suspence,as I waited to see how it was going to come out. I would call it my favorite movie of the year,even had a moody,spooky soundtrack which added to the surrealness of movie.How this movie slipped thru the cracks and wasn't on someones award list i'll never know.Redbox has it for $$1.00.Rent it ,sit back and enjoy a truly great movie.

B004I8WD7S|5.0|I love this new TPU material. Feels well gripped in hand, yet still slick enough to slide into the pocket. Fit very snugly on the phone, but was a little weird to see the Amazon logo on the back just below an Apple insignia... Very nice case though.<br /><br />UPDATE: A friend accidentally grabbed an extension cord my iPhone was plugged into and dragged it out the front door, over 15 feet of brick, through rock-gravel, dirt, and pine leaves....... not a scratch on the phone. This case is awesome! I'm buying another one.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I was more and more drawn into the story with each page I read. The story unfolded at the perfect pace, nothing seemed rushed nor too slow. I felt as though I could see exactly what Sophia was seeing & feeling because the imagery was so well written. I can not wait for the next book to come out and see what new mysteries and characters are in store for us! Would recommend this book to everyone!
B000PHX4VA|5.0|I like the new greatest hits album for The Police, but I hope the Message In A Box set is still available. This album is short songs that would complete my Police music collection.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Mahjong is very addictive! A great game for everyone.from the kids to the grandparents. Very entertaining and extremely fun. I highly recommend this!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|excellent version of mahjong. graphics are excellent on my EVO 3D. story mode is a plus as well. 2 thumbs up.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun version of the classic game.  This version is a bit more difficult to beat than some others I have played, which makes it much more realistic and enjoyable.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I never really enjoyed mahjong before, but somehow this is really fun to play. A neat storyline, progressively harder puzzles and changing tile themes give this game a refreshing appeal.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|really like this game. Got it free, glad I did but would have paid for it. I am using it on the Kindle Fire and it works great.
B005HI7NP0|5.0|Wow what a comeback especially w/Roots!!!!! I love Betty's new cd, brings u back the way music use to be good music love all of her song's!!!!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Great game. Try it out. Addicting. Running out of things to say now. Just try the game. It is fun
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This novel introduced me to the tone and social and political climate of a country that I (and, I'm discovering, most Americans) really know nothing about. I can't urge you strongly enough to read this book! Buy it, and pass it on! My interest in the story line never wavered; I never lost interest for a minute. If you want to educate yourself by way of a little historical fiction, you won't be disappointed. I found myself Googling and cross-referencing all aspects of this fascinating story, just because I was compelled to learn more about this dark, unyielding, psychologically complex nation shrouded in secrecy. This story should be required reading in the high school curriculum.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is so addicting! It is worth the 99&cent;. Although it was hard at first, I soon got the hang of it.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|this was a great way to spend some time.  unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to save my game.  lots of levels and challenges.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|There a way way too many things it will not load or play. It has Imab installed and will not uninstall it, then when you try to play something it says Im sorry but this is not available for your device. Plus the flash player that is installed when you get it is TURNED OFF in settings. You have to be savvy enough to figure this out and go turn it on, which helps a lot, but it still wants to only let you read from the LIMITED selection of Magazines Amazon offers. I do recommend TV.com as an app if you have one, cause it will play shows for you for free.<br /><br />There is no text to speak, so You still need a Kindle keyboard to be able to listen to a book while working in the house, kitchen etc. I have one and hook it to external speakers so I can listen while i workout etc. I tried to find an app for it but the only reading app is a toy that reads what you type on a page, or paste, which is hard to do. and worthless for a book.<br /><br />It is a nice device, but it is not perfect, it has no camera for Skype, and is missing a lot of things that my Droid Bionic can do easily, I got it for the larger screen, but have since found a cheaper tablet that does Skype, and more that I wish I had known about. I still love my Kindle Keyboard and use it for reading. The Fire is good for games, and news, e-mail, and twitter as well as Facebook. But it needs more.
B002RKSXJG|1.0|Boring, way too much description. Too long to get to any plot. Not worth the read. Who could possibly rate this as a good read. Are these reviews phony??
0062082353|5.0|I expected this book to be about the mechanics of being a sniper with a lot of battle detail.  This was not the case.  I quickly became engrossed with this book and could not put it down.  The insight into the life he led for so many years and the personal and professional strains on not only himself, but his family, friends and fellow soldiers gave a perspective on exactly what these people have done for this country and really hit home the sacrifices they have made.  It was not the perfectly written book, it had a few things in it that I wished had some more detail, but it is written as I would expect a SEAL to have done it.  Efficient, matter of fact, honest and a good dose of well earned self assuredness (not to be confused with arrogance).  I thought this was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Chris Kyle is a true American and patriot.  We will never know how many lives he saved and I wish he and his fellow SF brothers would have been given more latitude to do their jobs and save even more of our troops.  In reading this, I kept going back to what a Marine friend told be back in 2005 or 2006, \\"The Marines are at war, America is shopping at the mall.\\"  Thank a soldier.
0812992792|4.0|As an American who has visited North Korea (the DPRK), I was intrigued to find a novel set there. It's fiction, of course, and I see many thoughtful reviews already posted.  I won't attempt a lengthy one - only to say that I very much enjoyed this book and recommend it.  I visited in November 2008, and the visit remains vivid in my mind.  Even though I realize I would probably have a very similar experience if I were to go again, the prospect remains compelling.<br /><br />Johnson's writing sometimes seemed to ramble on and on, and it was confusing at times but I found myself able to tune out (accept on faith?) times when the distractions bothered me.  There were more than enough times that I found myself impressed to make up for the other times. Sometimes I thought the writing approached greatness - and that says a lot.
B004Y1WCDE|3.0|I love this app but Plex folks have not updated the version on Amazon Appstore (2.0.2.6) whereas Android Market has 2.0.3.3 which contains important bug fixes.<br /><br />Plex Developers: please fix this impropriety ASAP!
014103842X|5.0|I ordered this book for my daughter's high school English class.  It arrived promptly and in good condition.  I was thoroughly satisfied with the entire experience.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|A very good game.  Entertaining, good graphics and very very addictive.  You can't just play this game once you have to play it just a little bit longer.
1612130283|5.0|I rarely give a book 5 stars & am a bit embarassed that I have had my faced glued in this book for the last week!  I guess every once in a while, a sexy & trashy read is necessary to keep a girl going! This book did that for me.<br />I'm sure I'll read the next two in the series at some point.
B006ON41FC|5.0|love this game its the best its so dumb that's its so fun GET THIS APP ok good byeeeeeee byee
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I had never even heard of Leonard Cohen until a few years ago, despite being a lover of most genres of music.  A local performer with an angelic voice (Chelsea Berry, also available on Amazon) sang a few of his songs during some of her performances, so I made a mental note to find out more about him.  Well, it was only this past week that I got around to it and all I can say is I wish I had known of him much earlier in my life. His music is like nothing I've ever heard, in that it \\"speaks\\" directly to me. It is soulful, wise, thought-provoking, soothing, ethereal ...  So at age 62, here I am a hook, line and sinker Leonard Cohen fan. I have much listening to catch up on!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Yes there are 101games but the games you start with are stupid and annoying! On my kindle fire it cuts of most of the instructions.

B0067Q42BY|3.0|was ok....didn't appreciate all the ads.  its a paid app! why does it have ads on it?! I enjoyed the game, but it got boring after a little while.  its a good time waster.  worth a try.
B006ON41FC|3.0|direction sensors need to be more sensitive to make sharp turns. need different levels... not the same level with different goals.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like some games more than others but it kills time. Clearer looking games would be better. My kids like it.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Purchased this organizer to go with my Joovy stroller.  Very disappointed in stroller, the sippy cups my kids use didn't fit in their cup holders.  This organizer is great?  It holds larger sippy cups and has a deep enough pouch to hold snacks and stuff to keep kids happy in the mall.  Definately would recommend this organizer.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|we need more games like this. I loved playing this game and helping my children figure out the puzzles. we need more!!!

B006P0FICE|1.0|Air ships, and Matrix moves in this Victor Hugo's classic was dumb for a period piece. Fire the screen writer, and anyone who approved this crap. What a butcher job of a beloved classic!
B006ON41FC|4.0|This is an easy game to start but remains challenging as you.play. Even young players will enjoy it. Enjoy the fun of going nuts!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I am loving the whole free app of the day concept.  I remember playing mahjong with tiles, and this is just as much fun.  great graphics.
1594744769|3.0|I'm an adult that reads quite a bit of YA fiction. I saw the video before the book was released and it looked so intriguing!  Unfortunately, I agree with many other reviewers that gave this book 2 and 3 stars... I liked the incorporation of the photos to tell a story, but as a whole the story could have been executed better.  The book didn't \\"grab\\" me much at all and I found myself not caring what happened to anyone. I especially agree with the review of M. Cowan (3 stars).
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Fun, interesting.  It's not too hard.something to pass the time. Tiles are a bit small when you try to see the entire picture.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|For more of my reviews visit [...]    Title: Cinder  Author: Marissa Meyer  Rating - 4 Stars    FYI - No Spoilers in this one!  I actually began this post a couple days ago when I started reading Cinder and I thought I couldn't wait any longer without sharing.  And then I decided that reviews must wait until you've finished the book.  Damned self-discipline.  Speaking of which, I am sure that by now the head-whipping regularity with which I switch blog topics smacks of self-discipline, right?  Not.  Ok, I apologize.  I think I will try to keep book posts to the weekends and food posts to the week, when you are most likely cooking at home!  If you LIKE my book posts, please leave a comment so I know that they have interested you.    So on to Cinder, the new young adult science-fiction story from Marissa Meyer.  It is the first in the Lunar Chronicles series, which I assume is actually to be a trilogy.  I really appreciate that someone else is writing YA Sci-Fi (check out my book, Eden's Root, if you agree).  You'd be surprised how little YA sci-fi there is out there.  Many Dystopians touch on it, but aren't really sci-fi stories themselves.    Cinder DEFINITELY is science-fiction with hover cars, Lunar colonies, androids, cyborgs, and a few mystical powers.  Set in the future in 'New Beijing,' Linh Mei, aka Cinder is a teenaged cyborg and the region's most talented mechanic.  When Prince Kai, the land's most eligible bachelor and the dying Emperor's son, secretly brings her his personal android to fix, Cinder is inadvertently drawn into a world of high-stakes political intrigue and burgeoning war.    The Cinderella allegory in the story is meant to be blatant so I won't criticize that aspect.  I actually think she treated the story like an homage of sorts:  Cinderella on Tatooine (though not a desert, don't go getting all SW nerd on me).  Anyway, for the first twenty pages I was interested, but she throws a lot at you and its hard to get to know much about the characters, much like a TV pilot.    Again, this was not unexpected.  Backstory is a tricky thing, I struggled tremendously with my own in ER.  I think she handles it well, but the story really picks up once Cinder is 'volunteered' by her stepmother for plague antidote testing.  Cinder's stepmother and legal guardian has always resented her and blames her (perhaps correctly) for causing the infection of her daughter and Cinder's only friend, Peony, with the deadly letumosis plague.    Under serious medical scrutiny Cinder learns some very special and very dangerous secrets about herself, her kingdom, and the dreaded Queen Levana of the Lunars.  Though she has plans to use the night of the Coronation Ball to escape her stepmother permanently, Cinder makes a discovery when fixing the Prince's android that derails her plans.  She instead has to rush to the Ball to warn Prince Kai of Queen Levana's plans to kill him, and to turn the Earthens into mindless slaves, just as she's done the Lunars.  A confrontation between Lunars and Earthens at the Ball leaves the two sides on the brink of war and a bereft Cinder in jail, awaiting her execution.    Conclusion - This is a good, fun, and engaging read for those who enjoy science-fiction.  The mystical elements are somewhat scientifically-based and are not jarring as outright fantasy might be for those who do not prefer that genre/style.  For those who do enjoy a little fantasy mixed in, it is a welcome bit of fun.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great story in game and fun collectors badges for playing.  brings a new enjoyment to the classic mahjong tile clicking.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is suitable for all kid cus it has a mix of action racing adventure thriller hard and easy for everyone
B0067Q42BY|4.0|If there was more adventure in the adventure version, I'd rate 5 stars. The comic type narration leaves a lot to be desired. Other than that, love it!!!
031618201X|5.0|I read a lot of manga and most lose their flavor after a while, but I honestly found my self more than pleasantly surprised by this one. I haven't read the novel it was based on but I would never have known it. It was full of action and always seemed to have something going on and personally i liked that. I will admit it has some naughty moments but for a shojo manga it was tame. I plan on reading the novel for comparison and would love to see more of this series in the future and will gladly pass it on to my friends well worth the read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I can play for hours. my kids love it too. There are a lot of games to choose from and much more to unlock. Thanks
B00000K3CR|5.0|During 1988, there were at least four films that had the same idea of putting a child into a grown man's body.  Only one of them really worked and it was with the film Big.  The film is about a kid named Joshua Baskin.  While trying to impress a girl by riding a roller coaster, he is deemed to be too small and is not let onto the ride.  Feeling depressed, he goes to a wishing machine and wishes that he was \\"big.\\"  The next morning, Joshua wakes up to discover that he is big but not in the way he imagined it.  He wakes up in the body of a grown adult and spends the rest of the film trying to become a kid again.  He heads off to New York City with his best friend in the hopes of trying to find the machine and figure out how to explain Joshua's absence from his family.  In the hands of lesser talent, this film would have been a disaster.  Fortunately, the film went on to become one of the highest grossing films of 1988 thanks to terrific direction, a fantastic Oscar-nominated screenplay and the performance of a lifetime given by Tom Hanks.  Hanks went on to win a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.  Personally, I feel as though we would have won if Rain Man had not come out during the same year and Dustin Hoffman giving a truly memorable performance.  Hanks is completely believable as a 13-year-old kid trapped in the body of a 35-year-old.  We truly feel for Joshua as he learns about to complexities of adulthood with the longing for childhood.  The film is full of classic scenes such as Joshua using the large keyboard in the department store, his first time having a female over and especially the ending.  The supporting is cast is also terrific.  I personally felt that Elizabeth Perkins and the boy that played Joshua's friend should have received Oscar-nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Supporting Actors along with the film receiving a best picture nomination.  The screenplay touches on a wide variety of subjects such as valuing your childhood, the difficulty and challenges of growing up and really deciding on what you want.  For the kid in all of us, I would absolutely recommend this film to everyone.  It receives my highest rating of 5 out of 5 stars.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Although I have only been playing the Quest segment, I have found this version of Mahjongg to be quite engrossing.  I just cannot put it down once I start playing.  And if the other segments are even half as good as &quot;Quest&quot; is, then is app would be well-deserving of it's 4.99 asking price.<br />I will now have to check out their other apps to add to my game collection.  Keep up the awesome work!!!
B0064BWE8U|4.0|under both her pen names.  This was a delightful story and right until the end you really didn't know just how it was going to end.  My only complaints were that the ending seemed a little rushed (could have easily read WAYYYYYYYYYY more) and the footnotes.... oh my, the footnotes.  OK to start with but them I just ended up skimming them.  Written in true SK style with characters with similar traits to others she has written about but it makes it easy to follow, identify with them and you can literally picture everything she describes.  A loveable character whom I didn't really get annoyed with (as I can at times) and a lot of moments that really make you think.  Beautifully written and I'm looking forwards to SK's next book.  This was a great read, I'd give it 5 stars other than for the ending and footnotes... :(
B0067Q42BY|5.0|the app really is cool. maybe not worth 5 bucks but I got it for free so sweet. I like the visuals too
0877180121|5.0|I use this book every week!  It's great for children of all ages who can't yet read.  They only need to know the alphabet up to G.
0307949508|1.0|There is absolutely no need for another \\"review\\" of this book. As of this writing 1,480 of you have already written one  and this will be number 1481.<br /><br /> Why? Well, call it what you will, but having just seen the American film version of \\"Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\", I was reminded of the fact that I had read this book (Fire) when it was published three years ago and never really \\"got \\" it. So after seeing the movie I picked the book up again and read it again  to see whether I could make any more literary sense of it now than when I read it then..<br /><br /> Having done so, and having given it the benefit of the doubt, the verdict is still about the same. There are too many moving parts. The book may be a part of a literary phenomenon but it is still literary trash, stuff for the pulps. Not only is the action hard to follow it's fiction right out of Adventure Magazine.<br /><br /> Readers of Dragon Tattoo will remember how that story ended: Blomkvist had been empowered by Henrik Vanger with the information to \\"take down\\" the financier Wennerstrom. He had done just that and gained fame by publishing his book on the Wennerstron financial scandal. At the same time Lisbeth Salander had on her own and independently \\"taken down\\" Wennerstrom's financial empire to the tune of three billion kroner, all of which she then deposited safely in her own Swiss Bank accounts and disappeared.<br /><br /> And now as The Girl Who Played With Fire begins, it is year later. Salander has dropped out of sight - intentionally - and she is sitting on the beach in Granada reading Dimensions In Mathematics by Dr. L.C.Parnault (Harvard University Press 1999) - There is no such book - She still has the body of a 12 year old plus the Dragon Tattoo, but she has cleaned up her act. Most of her Goth-like appearance - piercings, tattoos etc. - has been removed and a Swiss plastic surgeon has given her bra-deserving breasts. Yet she is still the same Slander with an uncompromising black or white view of the world. Things are either right or wrong, never in between Her unique talents are unimpaired - a photographic memory, exceptional hacker skills, her temper, her cobra like quickness to attack, defend or escape and all her enviable martial arts. Her qualities of love, sensitivity, tenderness and humanity still exist but also lie still mummified within her. Her tragedy is that she cannot really love nor express much love - if any.<br /><br /> There is a hurricane which pretty well destroys the hotel where she has been staying for weeks; so, using the disguise under which she has been traveling (Irene Nasser from Norway), she returns to Stockholm, purchases a luxurious apartment and starts to contemplate her future. But it turns out there's little time for that. Her fingerprints are found on a gun used to murder three people - Nils Bjurman, Salander's old guardian and deadly enemy, and two nice young researchers who were preparing an expose for Millennium on the crimes of human trafficking in young girls from the Baltic States and Russia. Immediately she becomes a most wanted woman. She goes to ground. And the action starts.<br /><br /> Three investigations start independently and for different reasons. The first, obviously, is the official Police Investigation. Then there is the Armansky investigation commenced by her old employer Dragan Armanski of Milton Security and who has the feeling that she has been set up. And finally there is the  Blomqvist/Millenium investigation carried out by Blomqvist and employees of Millenium - which needs a bit of background. (Having discovered that Salander is back Blomqvist has tried unsuccessfully to get in touch. She has resisted. But he still cares very much for her and wants to help her out of her problem if he can. The, too, the two young people who were killed were in essence working in tandem with the Millenium staff and hence both Blomqvist and Millenium have a substantial interest in justice being observed;and they enter into the investigation with purpose - Blomqvist himself far ahead of the pack.)<br /><br /> It would have ben best for the author to have stopped here and proceeded with a straight out whodunit, because if there are three investigations running contemporaneously and if there are related events happening in each it is difficult for any author to introduce them serially - which he has to do because he's writing in the narrative. The reader has to jump from the events in one investigation to another and remember what was in the first and how it was or is related to the second etc. But that doesn't happen.<br /><br /> Then, on top of this problem of narrative, Larssen introduces a new stand-alone story - Salander's life as a juvenile in Sweden's juvenile justice system plus her experiences as the object of a trumped up finding that she is a danger to herself and others which has led to a year in restraints in a psychiatric \\"care\\" center at the instance of crooked psychiatrists with a real reason to lie.<br /><br /> There is a third story interwoven here too  - about Salander's real father, his background as a Soviet agent and the concealment of his identity by the highest echelons of Swedish security officialdom, all of which leads to chain saw violence, biker violence, plain physical violence, torture and arson - to name just a few of the complications<br /><br /> Complicating things even further is the fact that Larsson wrote in Swedish in Sweden for Swedish readers. All of his characters have Swedish surnames, a fact which poses no problem for his Swedish audience, but they read so similarly in English it's hard for an English reader to keep their identities separate.<br /><br /> Anther problem; He wrote in Stockholm about characters in Stockholm and about places in Stockholm or nearby: the locale is Stockholm and environs. If you are Swedish you will be able to follow the action geographically, but if you're not you get lost.  (Even with the aid of a good Atlas and constant resort to my Google Earth app I couldn't follow the action geographically.)<br /><br /> Bottom line. There are too many moving parts. Larsson has tried to tell too many stories in one book and the reader is left baffled and unrequited. It could have been a better book. It's still out of Adventure Magazine whose editors would have cleaned it up and selected one good narrative out of all the material crammed between these 501 pages.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|got this app free from the app store.  If I had known how good this Mahjong app was. back when I was downloading the free ones, I would have went ahead and paid for this one.  It isn't like any mahjong you have played before.  The great story line in the saga is one of a kind.  The other two choices have great graphics and the tiles change from one level to the next.  I will definately look for more from this company. Good job.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|cool game awesome graphics its my first game like this and I'm enjoying it a lot I recamend it to anyone. who wants to try mahjong.

B003AWRMCE|5.0|Unforgiven earned a #98 spot on the initial AFI top 100 listing and moved up to #68 in their 10 year anniversary revote. It well deserves this ranking, if not a higher one. The movie features stellar acting, amazing dialogue, gorgeous landscapes, and a compelling story of a gunfighter who is trying to \\"do right\\" and leave behind his previous life of violence.<br /><br />Eastwood is only lured back into strapping on his guns because his children are near starving, and the cause is just - a prostitute was cruelly sliced up by a cowboy. He enlists friend Freeman to help him with his task. Hackman and Harris are superb as other gun-wearing characters in this investigation of motives and characters.<br /><br />Every person here feels authentic and real. The Sheriff wants to keep the peace, but can be a bully in his task. He has a quiet home he's trying to build, and he enjoys sharing his experiences. Freeman's relationship with his wife, the gentle way he deals with Woolvett, how he handles the shooting scene, are all amazing to watch. In each case the watcher gets drawn into what is happening through the subtle dialogue and the character's actions, rather than with bland statements found in many other westerns.<br /><br />It's interesting that I watched this back-to-back with Shane. I am still surprised that Unforgiven ranks \\"worse\\" than Shane on the AFI lists. They handle extremely similar topics - how an ex-gunfighter copes with a world that has moved on around him. But Unforgiven is full of rounded characters, of powerful dialogue, and of a world we can immerse in. When Eastwood returns home at the end, it's an extremely powerful moment, and there was a real sense of the transformation which had occurred over the course of the film.<br /><br />Unforgiven also gets great credit for how well it involves women in the storyline. Many westerns seem to feel that women were non-existent in the West, only there to be stolen by \\"wild Indians\\" or to scream in horror as their menfolk went off to do some fighting. In Unforgiven, we get a range of very powerful female characters. The main group are the prostitutes, who take a stand against being treated like property and who end up having an impact with their actions. Even Freeman's wife gives a subtle yet powerful performance as the reluctant one left behind.<br /><br />Well deserving of winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Supporting Actor for Hackman's Sheriff character. To me this is what a western should be all about. The challenges of living in a rough land, the challenges of dealing with the tumultuous societal changes that were going on, the clashes between different groups of people, and the rough, wild, fantastically beautiful scenery that it was all set in.enfolk went off to do some fighting.

0385523912|5.0|I received this book on Friday and finished it on Saturday.  These stirring real-life tales make clear how this malevolent Orwellian regime keeps people in slavery and ignorance. The breakdown of the system is even more frightening when outside help is not allowed by the state.  The author does an outstanding job of weaving the accounts of multiple North Koreans from one region together to reveal the entire terrifying story.
B006ON41FC|3.0|Great game for kids.!!!!!! addicting. fun the  whole family. And the little guy is cute.!!!!!!  Gotta love collecting nuts, and flying through the trees. just watch out the trees can hurt.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|enjoyable for the Kids and me. I was looking for something that the family could do when I wasn't reading. Having the challenge of getting to the next level is always great.
B006ON41FC|5.0|so fun and addicting I cant put the game down. must get this game it is totally wroth 99 cents

B006ON41FC|5.0|It's really hard to actually stop playing this game. Its super addicting! and a whole bunch of good fun. Once you start its almost imposssible to our down.
B006Z20976|5.0|Accountability, faith and grace.  My husband and I agree this is a must see!  It really makes you step back and take a long look at parenting...and loving your family unconditionally along with respecting those around you as you never know what someone is going through in there life.  You will need a tissue box handy, it is a real life slap you in the face drama.  Accountability, faith and grace.  Great job on this one! I will be buying a couple more copies to give  to our sons.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|love this app....way better than doc to go, and quickoffice...easiest to navigate as well as edit/change settings.  very simple to make spreadsheets from scratch.
B00022M518|5.0|I finally got this classic 70's album, which is without a doubt one of the most original sounds of the British glamrock era. The real \\"Velvet Goldmine\\". Glam lasted all too briefly in my opinion and so many people today will probably never realize where a lot of bands they love got their influences from, Eno is at the top of that list with Bowie, Bolan, etc. I feel very fortunate to know this music and I love it even more today, still fresh sounding and alive.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This app is fun and works great on my Droid charge. The tutorial was good because I had no idea how to play but I learned quick.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not to bad. I like the challenge of earning the points to get the games. its a great way to kill time on my lunch break
B00526ZKYS|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable! The characters were engaging & the world-building so well done, that I believed it. All of it. The epigraph device was sheer brilliance & added so much texture to the story.<br /><br />Lena was a very good lead & she had a clear voice that was sustained throughout. I loved Hana & when she was missing for long stretches, I missed her. Alex was very well done & was written in such a way that he didn't seem to just be in the story because Lena needed a love interest (honestly, Alex made me cheer for the romance aspect of the story. He was that worthwhile a character & I was pleasantly surprised). Grace was adorable & I smiled often reading about her. I even felt empathy for Carol & Rachel, who've had this thing done to them & are in a sort of zombified state. I am seriously pulling for Lena's mother to turn up in the next installment & thought that though absent, she was a striking part of the story.<br /><br />I was so caught up in the emotion of it all that I found myself chanting \\"Come on, Lena! Save yourself!\\" when we near the end of the story. It goes without saying that I'll be reading the next in the series. Even if the preview didn't come with the edition I have, the story was so engaging & unputdownable, I have to know what's coming next.

B00406UK7S|3.0|Centurion is Neil Marshall's take on the legend of the disappearance of the 9th Legion in Scotland in AD 117.Known for horror movies-Dog Soldiers,The Descent-he gives us a gritty,realistic,action epic of gore-fest proportions(ferocious battle scenes,bloody carnage, axed heads).We feel the cold weather sharper than a wolve's tooth.We are in the mud,rain and bogginess of Scotland,with an army stationed far from home,fighting a war politicians deem to be a lost cause,against tribes who mount guerrilla attacks then disappear into the shadows.The core of the film is centurion Quintus Dias(Fassbender) who is being chased at the start of the film who gives the voiceover narrative. After his garrison is attacked, and Dias captured,governor Agricola sends the 9th Legion north to crush the Pictish rebellion.Accompanied by a Brigantian tracker,Etain(Kurylenko),the legion marches north of Roman territory and finds Dias,shortly before being ambushed by Picts.Unknown stories are at the source of the energy of this subject.  Most of the legionaries are killed and their general Flavius(West),is captured.Etain has betrayed them.She wants revenge.Her backstory is her father murdered,her mother and herself raped by the Romans and her tongue cut out.Marshall explores the legend not historical fact,driven as we are by our sense of the underdog,we are intrigued by the way Scotland put a barrier to Rome's expansionist ambitions.We get little sense of the Pictish sense of injustice:they become demonised,we root for the surviving remnants of the 9th under the leadership of Dias, the movie largely becomes a thriller chase of the Romans by Etain's Picts back to the garrison. There are eye-gougings and amputations and a skimpy romantic sub-plot, all but concealed behind the desaturated geysers of blood.Dias becomes the only survivor as Agricola orders the Romans to keep the failure of the 9th secret.I liked the acting of West and Fassbinder,and the naturalistic photography but the story got abit lost and petered out unsatisfactorily. I preferred The Eagle's version,where the Romans are given American accents.\\"A War without honour,without end.\\"
B004V5QWU2|5.0|There are two things that I look for in a white noise generator or a sound machine, and this app manages both of them superbly.<br />1. variety of sounds.  The creator(s) have put serious thought into what a broad spectrum audience may find relaxing.<br />2. looping, or lack of.  I find that once you have noticed that your sound is looping, it becomes more of a distraction than a relaxation. Fortunately, I have not noticed that effect here.<br />Also, the feature that enables you to group up to three sounds at various volume levels makes it possible to create your own personal relaxing audio environment.  Skip the expensive machines and apps that only offer the usual beach, brook and birds.  This is the best deal for what it does.

B00532A8JI|5.0|For starters, my favorite tracks in order:  1. Electric Messiah  2. Reign in Madness  3. Children of a Faceless God  4. End of Innocence  5. When All is Lost  Symphony X delivers powerful guitar and keyboard solos as well as an overall darker vocal tone, compared to previous albums. This one definitely has a post-apocalyptic feel to it. The music is every bit as awe-inspiring as the album art!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this app because you can play a variety of solitaire game's just by selecting different ways to deal as well as different styles of solitaire.
B000BKHL1K|5.0|This wine rack is a well made, Modern and functional.  IT is basically a piece of art.  I purchased two and placed them linearly down the wall for a huge statement pice.  The rack holds the bottles securely and will hold various sizes of bottles.  I have had the rack installed for only a few short weeks and anyone who comes over always has a positive comment.  Be sure to locate a stud in the wall to secure the rack since it will be holding a good amount of weight.  The mounting system is basically  3 screws into the wall and doesnt give much flexibility if you have to be on a stud.  Overall it was easy to install in about 10 minutes once the location was selected.  I would purchase again.  Thumbs up if you are looking for a artpiece with some function.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game. Very fun and a great time waster. Challenging, fun graphics, and great for my competitive family!
B00004STDN|5.0|Cliffhanger is one of my favorite Stallone movies. Suspence, action, tragedy and a little love thrown in for good measure. I don't agree with those who say the plot is thin. It is a clear cut story with characters you want to succeed and villians you want to fail! Lithgow is so predictable but is effective in his roll as the mirthless bad guy. Stallone makes rock climbing look like the tough sport it is, even if you know that actual rock climbers have it a little tougher. A great movie in regular form, blu-ray makes the awesome background even more amazing. Just buy it!
B0073PZIYI|2.0|the story line for this movie is good, in theory, but the execution is boring.  i found myself hoping it'd be over soon.  the movie dragged on.  very disappointing because, like i said, the concept is a cool one.  i love JT, but i do NOT recommend this movie.
B004FS1TLM|5.0|I just recently discovered Michael Buble's music when searching for a recording of the song Moondance.  After purchasing and listening to his album with that song on it, I was hooked and had to have more.  This is the fifth one of his albums that I have purchased, and it did not disappoint.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|very nice graphics and sound. extremely high production value. good free app of the day on Amazon app store. easily worth a couple bucks.

0307959856|2.0|I love Jane Austen and so bought this book.  The beginning was a good attempt; the language close to what would be expected, even if underneath the reader could feel the modern world rumbling.  But the repetition of story lines that had already been set out was more than annoying.  The steps leading up to the discovery of the dead Denny was repeated and repeated, and the few surprises in the reveal of what really happened were deadened by endless repetition.  I must admit I was bored, something that never happens with Austen. I suggest the reader who is unfamiliar with Austen, buy one of her books instead of this one.
B006ON41FC|5.0|pretty awesome. i playbthis game a lot and it is my faveriote game on my kindle. Its really addicting. I reccomend this game to anyone, and let me asure you, its worth the money
B001V7P2W2|5.0|I haven't seen a movie recently that still holds a place in my memory as does the North Face. It's one of those that lingers for it's emotional impact it leaves with you. An absolute treasure!
B005V20JKI|4.0|I wish this would update at the time time and version as the Android market would. That would be awesome.
B004WESFZW|4.0|If you like sci-fi you'll probably find this movie interesting although it's probably more fantasy than sci-fi. Efforts are made in the movie to provide realism by using nationally know people in bit parts to add an aura of authenticity. The overall impression is one of a decent action movie which maintains a fairly brisk pace all the way through. Both leads do effective jobs in their roles with Matt Damon as a strong action lead and the Emily Blunt character as a lovely and vulnerable ballerina.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, the move is taken from a short story by Philip K. Dick whose writing career was unfortunately cut short by his untimely death. Dick was noted for his creative approach to storytelling and this story is one of those. It just happens to tread on some thin ice when it challenges the notion of free will, a sacred cow for those who are determined to believe they are the captains of their own fate; it becomes rather polarizing in that regard.<br /><br />It is probably a worthy addition for the collector but should be approached carefully by those who are not.
0316056871|5.0|Tina Fey gives a good light-hearted view into her world, flitting between stories of SNL, 30 Rock and her family life. Good light read for anyone who is interested in the world of contemporary American comedy in general and the phenomenon of Tina Fey in particular.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Hans Zimmer does it again. The Last Samurai as a movie was sometimes awkward with Tom Cruise as the star, but the music fits in with classic action/adventure soundtracks. It's a bit odd in that the movie doesn't go overboard to feel \\"Japanese\\", but rather tries to convey music fitting for a warrior. The wailing score near the end, the final battle, is really eerie. Perhaps this soundtrack isn't quite as memorable as Gladiator, but it's worth owning for music aficionados.
1594203334|4.0|I heard the author being interviewed on the radio and was intrigued by her ideas.  I downloaded this book for my Kindle and thought, \\"OK, I'll just read the first few pages and come back to it later.\\" Three chapters later I realized I was still sitting there reading! The whole book was like that. The author's conversational style makes for easy and pleasurable reading.  Her honesty and humility about her own parenting skills give this book a real \\"sitting around dishing with your girlfriend\\" feel.  Many of the techniques she describes are techniques that I, an American, have used with my 4 children but I am in the minority. I appreciated how she put a name to things that I have done but, like the French women she interviewed, did not know how to explain to someone else. I don't think the author is trying to say that the French are the only ones who know these techniques, that is just where SHE found them, but I have seen some of these same parenting ideas in other countries as well.  I have very rarely seen them used in the US and I've lived in 8 states.  Having lived in Europe, I have found her observations about their children being better behaved, more patient and more respectful IN GENERAL to be quite true.  Yes, they have bratty kids but not the PLAGUE of them that we have in the US. There is clearly something that we can learn from their approach.  The quality of the food aside, eating in a restaurant in Europe is an entirely different experience.  Seeing a five year old speaking quietly and using impeccable table manners is a daily occurrence in France, England or Germany.  Most Americans I know would not even believe such a thing was POSSIBLE. I think one of the most useful things this book does is to give Americans insight into what children are capable of if properly trained. I honestly think that most Americans believe that being snotty brats is \\"normal\\" childhood behavior!  What the author calls \\"The Pause\\" is something that I have always done and had results exactly as she described (all 4 of my children \\"did their nights\\" by 3 months) but I have observed, as the author did, that that is not common among American parents. I am not one of those Americans who worships the French, but when they have a method that consistently WORKS, obviously better than what most of us are doing, why not look into it?

Not all that in graphics, but it makes up for it in variety.  A decent timekiller, and kids will like it.

B002W1HBN4|5.0|Wow! A classic album given the royal treatment! The extras here are TRULY spectacular. The footage of Whitney on the Merv Griffin show alone makes this worth the purchase-not to mention the video extras and the remixes. Truly happy with the care and thought that went into this one.

I'll just say that this is a tale to be read, loved, enjoyed, savored, discussed, and remembered.  I was alternately amused, saddened, horrified and entertained.  Pi is simply a beautiful book.

B001Q9J4PG|3.0|I've made a few attempts at this book and finally got through it. Admit I'm a peripheral Clancy fan and was really pulled in to the great action sequences, but after a while found that there were too many side stories and got bogged down by the technical details. If you're a Clancy fan, though, I'd bet this would hit the mark.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|This game is addictive, and hard to put down.  It was really, really enjoyable.  What's wrong with it?  It SLURPS up your battery -- play it while plugged in.  And it's really hard to put down.  The ads are a bother, but hey, I'm good at ignoring ads.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|My wife and I are both enjoying this program very much.  Lots of different ways to play it,  with as much, or as little help as you need.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Picked up this game today and am VERY pleased!  It is fun and well done, with many levels, good graphics, and all the extras I usually want in a game. (Top on the list is that games can be saved by name, so different family members can play and save the scores on their own name!) There are three game modes (Quest, Classic, and Endless) and multiple tile illustrations - the illustrations are beautiful, by the way! You can set the game to automatically zoom as you have less and less tiles - very nice feature.  There was a pop up asking me to review the game, which was a bit annoying, but that may only come with the special offer (free).  (I told it \\"No Thanks\\" as trying to type in a review on a tablet would be long and annoying - much better to do on my PC!)  Anyway, I kept looking at this game and it had great reviews, but was a little bit leery of paying $5 for a tablet game. However, now that I've played this one, I will definitely be checking out other games by G5!

B005SFR7YE|2.0|For those of us who wanted to see a recreation of the original stage production preserved on video, this is a huge disappointment.  It's all \\"new!\\" and \\"improved!\\"....it's new all right but not improved.  I hate seeing new technology imposed on the stage.  Films have been ruined for years now by too much reliance on CGI and 3D....if this production of the \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is any indication, reliance on \\"technology\\" has now invaded stage productions.  If so, this is unfortunate news for theatre lovers.  With the LED screens, the producers have tried to meld the \\"art\\" of the video game with the art of the stage and it just doesn't work.  The LED screens are extremely distracting and totally spoil the suspension of disbelief.  While trying to get lost in the magic of the music and the story, you are instead distracted by the obvious fakeness of background \\"sets\\" imposed on the viewer via large television screens with the individual pixels in plain sight.  It is so distracting that the magic is lost and the action on the stage is, at times, laughable.  This is really quite a shame.  The libretto is identical. Not one scene has been changed or left out.  However, the staging has been radically altered.  \\"Masquerade\\" for example, no longer takes place on the staircase of the Paris Opera House.  Instead, it takes up the entire stage with far too many people on that huge stage.  And the Phantom's mysterious entrance is entirely ruined by having him enter on a GIANT LED screen....it's awful.  Christine sings \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" to the AUDIENCE....not to her father's grave.  The \\"grave\\" is BEHIND her on a big ugly LED screen!  One of the best scenes was utterly ruined, at least for me.  There are horrible examples of this peppered throughout...just when you start getting into the beautiful music, you are distracted by the awful staging and the fakiness of the LED screens.  On a rare positive note, the singing is crystal clear.  You can hear every single word clearly and the libretto is perfectly understandable.  Also, because the camera can come in very close, you can see the acting of the performers and, for the most part, it is very good.  The last scene with Christine returning the Phantom's ring is especially moving.  If you love \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" as much as I do, I recommend that you rent this just to hear the wonderful libretto and see the expressions of the actors up close.  It's not a wise purchase however.  You probably won't want to see it again for the reasons I've mentioned.  The best way to see ANY musical is in person at the theatre of course. I hope that the \\"old\\" Phantom will continue to be staged as it was originally.  However, I fear that this \\"new and improved\\" Phantom may displace the old and that will be darned shame.  If that happens, we will only have our cherished memories to remind us how great this show once was.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|Game is fun to play. Like the story line that this game has but, I would have to agree with others, that this game is kinda short.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app !!!! it s a must have it reads to me when my eyes are too tired to read
B004TTMYQG|1.0|I purchased it but my kindle fire wont let me download it.  I'm dissappointed that the app store let me purchase it for a device that it wont allow me to download to

B006ON41FC|5.0|This is a really cute addicting game. The only problem I am having is that I bought one of the permanent helmets but it doesn't work..
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it...a God sent.  The reading to feature is awesome and the access to reading plans via reminders is a blessing.  I now read everyday and am growing towards Gods will for me.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is amazing, one free account creates an almost unlimeted number of notes. So much so that I use this as my only thing for most classes in school.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|this story is a touching story of two pweples devotion to each other. if you are thinking aout getting this book do it! you wont regret it! i couldnt put it down!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It helps with the stress. It takes it away as soon as you start playing. And the green piggies make me laugh.
B006ON41FC|4.0|This app is fairly good. It can get a little repetitive. What it does have is great challenges that are very addicting. Hopefully devs will add more upgrades and more landscapes.

0385342063|5.0|Every bit as charming and funny as you expect from Kinsella.<br /><br />Poppy is a great big goofball of a character that you can't help wishing was your best friend.  We spend about ten days with her while she is sharing a phone with a complete stranger.  Sam helps her deal with the craziness of planning a wedding, losing an engagement ring, and discovering her fiance isn't all he's cracked up to be.<br /><br />Poppy and Sam get to know each other through texts and voicemails and very quickly find themselves more involved in each other's lives than they ever intended-- and much better off for it.<br /><br />I literally laughed so much that I had to leave the room so I wouldn't disturb my husband!  This book is hilarious, and sweet.<br /><br />buy it.  read it.  you'll love it.
0470913029|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations.  I was expecting a no-carb, high fat/meat diet and was pleastently suprised with the content.  The author includes a lot of interesting facts from history that turn your knowledge of food and what we should be eating on it's head...without being confusing or contradictory.  There are great recipes and 4 weeks of meal plans which is so helpful in a book like this.  I haven't gone completely paleo because some foods, like soy are not included and from my own self research are found to be high in phytoestrogens which are great, cancer barriers.  I highly recommend this book to any one wanting to change their diet and lifestyle.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun and challenging even for adults! Glad there are easier games so I don't feel completely incompetent. Recommend for others.
B006W0QOF2|2.0|I could not believe that Amazon gave this movie a 3.5 stars. It was the slowest movie ever produced. I have seen glaciers move faster! It's not worth the download.

B005D4Y522|5.0|Christian Thielemann and the Wiener Philharmoniker have created between them a new way of hearing the Beethoven Symphonies.  While the approach may sound radical to those used to Klemperer, Bernstein and others, it is a revolutionary and deeply creative effort. First, in listening to these recordings, one can hear every section of the orchestra with complete clarity, in perfect balance, one not overriding the other, and with the greatest sensitivity to the rich tones of which each instrument and orchestral section is capable. I've not heard anything like this in any other recording, which now seem muddy and heavy handed by comparison. Thielemann himself explains his approach in the accompanying DVD as combining what's been learned through hearing what are now traditional approaches to Beethoven's music with the newer tradition to attempt to hear what Beethoven might have intended the symphonies to sound like by the use of period instruments (such as was done by Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music).  He certainly takes liberties with traditional tempi and other aspects of the symphonies, but in doing so, forces us to listen more closely to their incredible richness. As an example, the lyrical feeling brought to the third movement of the Ninth Symphony was so astonishing, I had to listen to it twice the first time I played it. And the choir in the fourth movement achieves a power that will knock you down. Run, do not walk, to the nearest classical music outlet for these symphonies.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|snatched this up off the app store during a sale and must say I really enjoyed it. A must have for kindle fire owners.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I really enjoy mahjong a lot. This is a good version. Good layout and good game play. Interesting story as well. Good twist.

B002W1HBN4|5.0|In 2010 to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of Whitney Houston's first ever album, \\"Whitney Houston\\", Arista decided to release this remarkable 25th Anniversary Edition with extra bonus tracks, rare label pictures and a DVD.<br /><br /> The bonus tracks include 5 recordings, although none are new songs, but are remix versions and a live recording of \\"The Greatest Love of All\\" from a 1990 concert Whitney gave at Radio City Music Hall. The remixes are of the songs \\"How Will I Know\\", \\"Thinking About You\\" and \\"Someone For Me\\".<br /><br /> The songs here have been digitally restored in prime condition as well.<br /><br /> The DVD includes new interviews with Whitney and the president of Arista, Clive Davis, as well as various music videos and a rare interview if Whitney on her first television appearance on \\"The Merv Griffin Show\\" in 1984.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a really fun version of Mahjong.  Lots of different puzzles (and even different tiles) keep it interesting.  The background music is subtle enough that it is not distracting.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this fantasy, but agree with previous reviewers that the  hand-written letters and amazing vintage photographs are hard to see and read on the Kindle.  I solved that by using a magnifying glass for those pages.  I enjoyed the photography and when searching the author and more info on the photographs, I found it very interesting that he had the photos first, and developed this fascinating story about these pictures.  You can search this online and see larger images of the pictures.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fabulous training that starts automatically when you begin gameplay! Great game, highly recommend! Includes different modes of playing as well!

B0068MNO4S|1.0|I would have given Anonymous no stars, but then my comments wouldn't be posted. The acting was second rate.  Redgrave The Elder gave another one of her eccentric performances.  Mark Rylance has been called one of the great Shakespearean actors, but from his ham-handed performance in Anonymous he could have fooled me.  The men faded into the woodwork.  I knew the movie made a hash of English history and theatre and drama, so I wasn't surprised by anything.  I got the feeling John Orloff had a list of Oxfordian points he had to include in the movie and once he did, he checked then off.  The major problem I had with Anonymous is it's a bore!  There is no sense of urgency.  The story plods along.  The endless jumping back and forth in time made the story confusing to follow.  After seeing Anonymous, I understand why it tanked!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great fast action game.  Requires more thought than most games.  Like the clarity of the cards on the backgrounds.  Would recommend this one for everyone to try.
B00479SVBU|4.0|First the two very minor bad things.  1 - If you leave the 3.5mm cable into the input jack the MP3 player will pretend to play the songs on the SD card but nothing will happen until you pull that out.  2 - If you have it running and start your car and turn it back on and the power shuts off for a moment or you don't shut it off manually you will have to manually shut if off for it to work again. takes but a moment but it does hang on reading the SD card unless you remember to shut it off.  Otherwise WOW, Plays clean and clear.  no static.  Works great with all SDHC cards and below.  Works with any standard MP3 player or phone that outputs to the 3.5mm.  Playing pandora thru my smart phone on it is great.  It shows what is playing from the SD card into my radio information badge.  Great little attention to detail.  And the build quality is top notch.  Highly recommend this little guy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome games.  the variety keeps me busy when I have nothing to do.  the only thing is some of the games are hard to control.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've never had such a difficult workout - Jillian Michaels definitely makes sure that the 20 minutes is used effectively.  The entire thing, from the beginning of the warm-up to the end of the cool down is a little over 27 minutes.  There are three circuits, each containing three minutes of strength, two minutes of cardio and one minute of abs workout.  Many of the exercises are dual purpose, such as standing in a squat position while punching it out with hand weights.  I didn't have much excess weight to lose to begin with, but wanted to tone.  This did the trick!  I didn't really lose much weight, but I believe that I've built up a ton more muscle.  I've already purchased my second Jillian Michaels DVD and am looking at a third!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|really great puzzles and visuals will be excited to see the other titles from this developer.  fun stuff. interesting navigation and story lines.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A fun way to spend some time! some games are more fun then others but overall this is a great game.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I have had hours of fun with this game. glad I downloaded it but I cant get past one point!
0385535139|2.0|Grisham can deliver up a great page turning read. I look forward to his books. Unfortunately, this one didn't deliver.  The court scene was as dull as they come. It could have had a little more drama, with more of the defense witnesses cross-examined. He might have put more of a scare into the defense and left the reader with some doubt about the outcome.  Unfortunately, there was little mystery to this story. The only page turner driver in this book was the hope that something would get interesting, fun and unpredictable. That never happened.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Keeps asking me to rate, even during gameplay.  So fine here is your rating!  Also keeps logging me into openfeint!

B00138CT16|5.0|I love this movie and this soundtrack. I can't say enough about how much it chills me to listen to it as I envision the vast landscape of the west and great plains. The movie tells a great and inspiring story that makes one want to go back in time and experience the wildness and \\"innocence\\" of those adventuresome times, before the advent of technology and the construction of the interstates that allow us to advance through this landscape without much notice. There are very few soundtracks that create as much emotion as this one.  I have only one complaint with this release. The sequence of songs differs in some major ways from the 1990 version--why?
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Sexy - laid-back - and just plain wonderful.

B006ON41FC|5.0|this app is very entertaining and a great time waster. it doesn't require a lot of attention which is good for a fluff game.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|its a wonderfully great game! I love that I can play this on my phone! I can't get enough of it!
B0067Q42BY|1.0|It would be nice if it would detect when I'm selecting tiles to match. Every other touchscreen action it picks up, including zooming the game board in and out, menu selections and literally EVERY other touchscreen action. But I can't select a single tile. It looks like it would be a fun game (kind of a cross between Jewel Quest and Majhongg), but it's absolutely useless if I can't play it at all. Galaxy S.
B005PMMETI|5.0|Pain of Salvation has been my favorite musical project since 2005, and they've never let me down. Every song is a little different (sometimes extremely different!) from the others. I hear influences of other bands, but Pain of Salvation remains its own entity always. This is a great album, strong and heavy but beautiful and intricate.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is my first app review but this is definitely worthy! Lots of fun for this adult and my 5 yr old niece loved it too.  She was drawing away while waiting in a doctor's. office and you know what that's like.  She changed the paper colors, the markers, crayons, etc and just had a blast. Got the app for free but would definitely pay for it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|You really need to see this movie.  Parents especially fathers need to watch and take note. After you watch this watch Facing the Giants, Fly Wheel and Fireproof.
B006YXTRHY|1.0|I haven't liked this series from the very beginning. Unfortunately, I have been subjected to each movie by my wife so, alas, I have seen it. There are so many bad parts about this movie it's hard to know where to start. That being said, I'll go chrnologically:  Let's start with the wedding. Yes, yes, it was a lovely setting and everything, but I have once rather important question. If the wdding is taking place in the middle of the day why are none of the sparkly vampires SPARKLING? I hate the whole sparkling vampire schtick to begin with, but at least stay true to the storyline if that's the backstory in the books. Then, at the reception, why did I feel like I was watching a bad sitcom with the various cheesy toasts?  Fast forward to the honeymoon. This was your stereotypical happy honeymoon couple doing honeymoon things. I won't go into the wedding night thing because honestly it wasn't all that remarkable. So he broke the headboard and in the morning the room was trashed. Big deal. Yet, once again, they'e playing around in the middle of a sunny, cloudless day and nary a sparkle from the sparkly vamapire. I guess they burned up their special effects budget on the CSI/House biology sequences. Then, when Bella discovers she's pregnant, some native woman starts babbling in hr native tongue, only there's no translation (at least not on the copy that I watched) so no one has any clue what she's even saying since Edaward doesn't bother to translate for Bella.  Back to Forks and now we're treated to Bella starting to look thinner and more ghastly. Interestingly enough, my wife remarked about how much better Kristen Stewart looked in the beginning of the movie compared to all of the other movies. My explanation was instantaneous, having already known the plot: It's so when they make her look sunken and withdrawn from the fetus people would actually notice a change in her appearance. Low and behold, the first time we see Bella starting to feel the effects of the fetus feeding off her body, she looked just like she had in the previous three movies.  So, for the next hour and a half we're treated to the vampires freaking out trying to figure out how this baby can be born and not kill Bella, Jacob leapfrogging back and forth between dealing with losing Bella and becoming friends with the vamps to hating them and back again, and the werewolves saying that because Bella's pregnant and that's never happene before so, of course, everyone in that house has to die. Oh, and isn't it just a coincidence that the vampires hadn't fed in weeks so they're just a tad bit hungry. How interesting that none of them go blood crazy when the O negative starts getting poured into a shake for Bella yet during the final C-section scene it's game on.  That, of course, leads us to the \\"climax\\". First of all, I seriously question the logic behind the decision that the skilled physician should be the one to make the blood bank run and leave a bunch of untrained morons behind to take care of a nearly dead Bella. This, of course, leads us to the \\"bloody\\" C-section scene. Honestly, a huge deal was made about this being such a bloody and grotesque scene, but I've seen worse on primetime dramas like CSI, House, and Bones. Sure, they showed a tiny section of either intestine or bowel, but no where near as bloody as all of the reviews made it out to be when it first came out. Now, if reviewers had said the bloodiest in the series, then I could understand it. Also, why did they (either the screen writers or Stephanie Moyer herself) have a completely untrained, blonde bimbo performing the C-section? Yes, when my wife is in a life or death situation regarding birth, I want the scalpel handed off to the completely untrained blonde woman and have her hack away. I know this is only fiction, but come on now.  The end of the movie was just annoying. Jacob imprinting on the baby (can you say pedophile boys and girls?), the \\"fight\\" between the vamps and wolves, and the incrediblyannoying wait to see if it worked. Oh yes, I was certainly on the edge of my seat waiting to see just what happened. Would Bella really come back from the dead as a sparkly vampire, or is it too late and she's already dead (fingers crossed on that one). Who cares that it's already given away since this movie was called \\"Breaking Dawn: Part 1\\", maybe they'll make part two and have no Bella in it. Yeah, that's it. Then, FINALLY, Bella opens her eyes and they're red, roll credits. Oooooo, how suspensful. Even the credits looked completely B movie in style. I thought this was supposed to be a blockbuster film. Couldn't they drop a couple of bucks on the font at least?  In a nutshell, this was a pathetic attempt at stretching about 30 minutes of story into a two and a half hour movie and failing miserably. Do yourself a favor and skip it at all costs, you aren't missing anything.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|first time playing mahjong.  it's fun app and kept me interested.  the ads that some complained about really don't slow game play and are easy to overlook
B0067Q42BY|1.0|This app never actually ran on my Vision tablet. I have enjoyed other games from this group but this one never ran.

1592401791|5.0|I was overall pleased with this book. The surprise (for me) was how often McCartney played other instruments on Beatles recordings. I knew he played lead guitar occasionally and a little drums on the White Album, but apparently he did much more; even playing lead on \\"Taxman.\\" I never would have guessed that. I really enjoyed reading Geoff's slow development of relations with the group. Although he sounds absolutely unimpressed with Harrison during the early years, both technically and personality-wise, he comes to respect him later on as the Beatle's talents matured and he grew more confident. And though George Martin's contributions are barely mentioned for much of the sessions, Geoff makes strong note that he was an essential component during the early and middle recordings. Generally speaking, The Beatles' personalities are essentially what I always imagined them to be; Paul the amiable multi-talented perfectionist, John the wild, fast-paced Van Gogh who dealt with concept instead of detail, and George the struggling kid who could barely tread water until he learned to swim on his own. Ringo is the Beatle we get the least amount of insight to; even when engineering a solo album for him we get scant information from Geoff about working with him. I believe this is due to the adage \\"If you can't say something nice about someone...\\"  My complaints are few. Redundancies are one, like we get the picture early on that McCartney is his favored Beatle, but the point is driven home repeatedly throughout the book. Also, some of the technical engineering jargon can bog down the flow at times, and a few timelines are out os sync. I can easily recommend this book to anyone interested in the atmosphere and anecdotes that occurred within the secret confines of the making of Beatles albums.

0312641893|5.0|Cinder had one of the most exciting, interesting and unique opening lines, chapter... everything that I've ever had the pleasure of reading. If the first chapter didn't suck you in and swallow you whole, maybe you were reading an imposter because I was utterly powerless to resist. And I actually did try to resist. I bought Cinder but planned on reading another book first. I only wanted to take a peek into Cinder... annndd instead I ended up reading the whole thing as soon as humanly possibly.<br /><br />I loved all of the new twists and turns that aren't in the Cinderella I'm familiar with (Disney, anyone?) but also loved the hints at the original story. Iko as Cinder's 'helper mice' was my favorite. The plague was an especially interesting addition and gave the story an even grittier feel than it already had as a cyborg living in a post-war world. I also liked the cyborg draft that came with that and Cinder's conflicting emotions because of her sister. It definitely made the reader have to step back and consider that gray area between right and wrong. The draft was horrifying, especially the public's reasoning behind it, but at the same time we are left with the question 'does the end justify the means if it saves the lives of so many dying people'.<br /><br />I fell madly in love with all of the characters especially Cinder, Iko and Kai. I liked how strong and distinctive they were. They were actually real; they had fears and doubts and wishes. I really enjoyed how were we never told 'who' these characters were explicitly, but by the end of the book 'knew' them completely. Cinder is one of the best female heroines I have ever read about. Her 'making' her own magic was especially important to me, as was the fact that she relied on herself rather than sit and cry like the Disney version.<br /><br />I loved the ending. Normally I hate cliffhangers but I found Cinder to be tied up just enough to satisfy me yet make me long desperately for Scarlet. Don't pick up the book and expect and quick, fun read. I loved the book to pieces but certain parts destroyed me. I cried several times, I got so angry and was ready to bite off the heads of anyone who dared interrupt my reading etc. Cinder was a very powerful book. I enjoyed it immensely but I don't think I could ever call it a 'just for fun' read.ead. I loved the book to pieces but certain parts destroyed me.

If you have not read the series, you might be lost during some parts and this is not a movie made for young children!

B0062NAX1U|5.0|Of course it's good - it's from Sherwood Baptist church and they have done wonderful jobs w/Facing the Giants, Flywheel, and Fireproof. I don't expect anything less than good wholesome movies and this one is no exception.

B006QPVH6O|3.0|I am not a big fan of the \\"found footage\\" kind of movie. This one was better than others I have seen. I remember the Moon landing of 1969. This is a good movie of what could have happened if a moon landing had gone horribly wrong. It is kind of Blair Witch Project meets Capricorn One. Worth a look.

B006SV2LWA|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It is well cast with several A list actors. It revolves around an outbreak of a terrible virus that acts fast to kill its victims. It jumps around a bit to much for me or I would have given it 5 Stars. It starts at Day 2 and ends with Day 1 leaving us to try to figure out HOW the virus got started before the big reveal of Day 1.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|Whats there to say really...it's mahjong. It's fun, but the ads take away from the experience.  Granted it was free.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|I never saw the original so I have nothing to compare this to. Watched it to see Jeff Branson in a non-soap opera role. It is full of violence, though the rape scene was not as bad as was written. Jennifer exacts her revenge on five males who assault/rape her while at a rented cabin in the woods. Ironically, the one act of revenge I could not stand to watch was the one on Johnny (Jeff Branson). I have a phobia about dental torture. That said, it was a good movie. Good solid 8/10.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|All you have to do is ignore the very first screen (ref: ads). So far this game is very well designed, movement is smooth, and just overall looks good!!! I don't know where all the bad complaints about ads are coming from!

I say any little girl looking for a pet would love this kitty cat and you don't have to clean up after Cashmere either <3
B0012IWHDW|4.0|This is the album of the soundtrack to Sam Peckinpah's flawed 1973 cinematic masterpiece of the same name. The film had a difficult and complicated birth in the hands of MGM and eventually emerged in several different versions of differing lengths and containing/excluding different scenes, until Peckinpah finally released his long-awaited and definitive `Director's Cut' in 1988.<br /><br />The film, if you've never seen it, is a long sprawling epic about the final days of William Bonney (played by Kris Kristofferson) as he is hunted down by former friend-and-mentor-now-turned-lawman, Pat Garrett (excellently played by James Coburn in probably his career-best role) against the frontier landscape and society of New Mexico in the final days of the Old West. Dylan was introduced to Peckinpah by Kristofferson and not only wrote the score but also has a supporting part in the film as the character `Alias', a quiet but enigmatic outlaw type with sparse dialogue who acts as a kind of bridge between Garrett and The Kid as he shows up in different places, and though we never learn much about the character Dylan is actually pretty good in the role.<br /><br />The album contains `Knockin' on Heaven's Door' which was a successful single release both in the US and in Europe in 1973, and remains by common agreement one of Dylan's greatest-ever songs. Other than that, different tempo variations of the main theme `Billy' (which works beautifully in holding the film together) and some quirky instrumental pieces fill out the album.<br /><br />This is less an album of poignant and soul-stirring power like `Blood on the Tracks' or `Time out of Mind'; more a mood-setter. Dylan's style and delivery are faultless in conveying the atmosphere of the film's story, of New Mexico and of the last days of the Old West. It's truly great driving music, wherever you are.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a very fun game!!! I love it!! All the games are awesome!!!! I like the varity, keeps me entertained for hours
B004KA9VGA|1.0|Essentially, this book is drivel. Mary Sue style slop with a very superficial facade of being intelligent. Here is a tip, just because something is set in a university  setting does not mean it is intelligent. Some of the most useless people I know have higher level degrees. Considering how much they go on about their positions in academia, Diana and her darling, beloved Matthew would be two of the most idiotic characters I have ever come across.  Diana. There was not a single flaw in this character, she made Bella look layered and intelligent! She was perfect at everything she tried, an annoying example for me was when in France she rides Matthew's horses (a vampire on a horse, lol!) , now I have devoted my life to riding and breeding horses so it does rankle, just a tad where despite having much experience the character is 'proficient at dressage and show jumping' and then there were gems like 'Horses hate having their feet touched!' no one has told any of my 7 horses this, but I'll let them know.  Matthew made Edward look like a respectful and normal guy (vampire, oops!) he was every bit as possessive and mon coeur take me now-ish as  your average cliched vampire sex god, oh wait, he doesn't like to have sex though, so that was rather familiar as well. He didn't come across as sexy AT ALL, just creepy and weird. And when they kept going to yoga! I couldn't stop laughing.  The plot was dull and contrived, the book was far too long and really needed a good editor. The only reason I got through the whole lot was a long plane trip and little else to do. Unless you enjoy paying for purgatory, give this one a miss.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As a mother of a cancer survivor, I was very hesitate to read this book. I thought I would read the first chapter just before I went to bed, by 4am I was finishing the book. Absolutely amazing! I cried, laughed, experienced anger, and felt hope as I turned the pages. It is an must read! Their lives were unstoppable and they shared so much love that even the cancer couldn't stop them from living. Filled with compassion and empathy - kuddos John Green

0780631684|5.0|Possible Spoilers<br /><br />What happens if you could see your death and how it occurs? Would you do everything you could to prevent it and change the course of your life and cheat death? Well for high school senior Alex Browning (Devon Sawa, \\"Casper\\") he has a fear of flying, which doesn't make a senior class trip to Paris, France any easier for him to deal with. However he does get on the plane and suddenly has a vision of the plane ripping apart and blowing up, wish of course frightens him and he causes enough of a scene that he gets thrown off the plane and a teacher and a few students follow him. Among them are Clear Rivers (Ali Larter, \\"Obsessed\\", T.V.'s \\"Heroes\\") and Carter Horton (Kerr Smith, TV's \\"Dawson's Creek\\").<br /><br />The plane takes off and does end up blowing up, so while he's never charged with the crime almost everyone who survived and was affected by the disaster blames him for it. A few months pass and strange things start to happen, the students involved end up having strange things happen to them and those who survived find out the hard way that you can't escape or cheat death. Tony Todd (\\"Candyman\\", \\"The Rock\\") makes an appearance as a mortician who talks about deaths design for everyone and when your number is up you can't escape.<br /><br />While this sounds like typical horror fare and at times it is what helps \\"Final Destination\\" is a good cast, some inventive death scenes and a halfway decent story that really makes it seem like more of a film than the later sequels. One particular favorite scene of mine was when a blond girl is fed up and goes to leave only to forget she should look both ways before crossing the street, for lack of a better cliche.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed this film as it was well paced, good amount of scares and gore and again the acting really wasn't too bad. Its worth having if you're a horror fan. ***1/2 out of 4 stars.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|My take from the reviews is that everyone loved it except those for whom Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman are the only ones to play the Phantom and Christine.  I find the entire movie entrancing and have watched it repeatedly.  I have also now read the book, twice, and I think it is sadly lacking in depth and imagination with comparison to the movie version of the story.  I don't understand criticism of Gerry Butler's voice.  He has a powerful, strong, and pure voice.  What he does is to act certain bits rather than singing them, using a rough and growling voice to communicate the emotion of the Phantom.  An example is bits of the final scene in his lair where he communicates an extraordinary range of emotions--vulnerability, adolescent cockiness, viciousness, rage, tenderness,heartbreak.  His version of Music of the Night is a good example of his capability to sing with crystalline purity of tone.  The other criticism I don't understand is of Patrick Wilson.  Bland?  I see him as providing a picture perfect portrayal of the ultimate romantic hero.  His loyalty, his bravery, his tenderness with Christine--I can't watch him without thinking, yes, he is truly the sane choice!  It does seem unfair that he was blessed with looks and position.  However, let's not forget that Christine loved him since she was a child, when she had a schoolgirl crush on him (and he on her).  Butler's phantom is sexy but running off with a serial killer?  I don't think so.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This was the free app of the day, so I got it.... LOVE IT!!!!! Who cares about openfeit?! I dont  l
B005SFS4ZU|4.0|Very good production, finally, the stage version on DVD.  I missed the bride in the Lair, and also the Phantom descending the stairway in the Masquerade number; not sure why those scenes weren't used.  The pacing was a bit fast, but that's a personal preference, I guess.  Ms. Boggess and Mr. Karimloo are very good; but, I'll have to put in a plug for my favorite Christine - Rebecca Luker in the Broadway production in 1989-1990 era.  I've yet to hear a better voiced Christine.
B000UDJS2S|4.0|\\"Ghost Rider\\" is an enjoyable big screen adaptation of the Marvel Ghost Rider comic that works on most levels. We wanted to see this before heading out to see the new movie, and I am glad for the revist.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The story starts following Johnny Blaze as a young motorcycle stunt rider that makes a deal with the devil. Like most deals of this type, even when made with the best of intentions, it doesn't work out like Johnny plans. Years later the devil come calling to collect on his debt and that is when things get interesting. As Johnny becomes the \\"Ghost Rider\\", he discovers that he has more free will than one might expect for \\"The Devil's Bounty Hunter\\".<br /><br />The casting is fairly good, even with a slightly older than he should be Nicholas Cage in the lead, but it works. I really enjoyed Eva Mendes as Roxanne, Johnny's girlfriend, and Sam Elliott as an unexpected mentor. Peter Fonda also is believable as the devil. The special effects are also fairly good and help carry the movie through the slower parts.<br /><br />I enjoyed this a lot, especially for a comic book based movie.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B006ON41FC|5.0|It has great graphics and sound.  All of the negative reviews based on the OpenFeint settingd are wrong.  You can disable it.  You can also adjust the sound settings.  They were just trolls.<br /><br />I'm 42 and like it and my 3 year old loves it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really like this game. The graphics are excellent. It definitely. has some good twists on the standard Mahjong game. I don't have a problem with the opening screen.

1250006341|5.0|Yes, I love the TV series, but that's not the reason I gave this book five stars.  Not only does it give background on the major characters but it delves into history and customs as well.  The author, niece of the series creator, gives us the opportunity to peak into the lives of not just the characters we have come to love but also real-life people who lived in the English country homes, both the servants and the homeowners.  The photographs beginning chapter one are a good reminder of who does what in the big house; the quotations every few pages remind us of the wit and tone from specific episodes.  But more importantly to me, we are given a look at the history of England, of a time when the inhabitants of these large houses waited for things expected and unexpected, when a war was looming, when a kitchen maid was the lowest rung on the servant's ladder but she was nevertheless grateful to be a step above poverty.  I highly recommend this book to both fans and nonfans of Downton Abbey, for there is much to be learned.<br /><br />A favorite quote (pg 204):<br /><br />Mary:  \\"How many times am I to be ordered to marry the man sitting next to me at dinner?\\"<br />Cora:  \\"As many times as it takes.\\"
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love it and it is interesting to learn a new way to play. Beats the heck out of most of what is available.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game was strait. I only played like twelve games but its still okay. some games were kinds hard but I finally passed them all.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I've been a fan of Star Trek since i 6 yrs old and use to watch it everyday after school along with bugs bunny and speed racer, the charisma of Kirk and logic from Spock and humor from McCoy in my opinion is what made the series a hit. Even when the movies came out you couldn't help but watch them repeatedly over and over as well, the last movie (the reboot) really put everyone's personality into perspective as to why they acted like they did.  This collectors edition is must have, no matter how many times you watch the movie each new viewing is like a brand new adventure.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|1 word,....... awesome there are many games honestly I just did this to get two hundred fifty thousand extra points
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Buy this book immediately.  I bought the Kindle version and liked it so much I may just buy the Hardcover copy as well, which is a status reserved for absolute classics.  After reading this book, I went on an all out 80's movie and music marathon that has not let up since I finished it.  I was born in 1981, but for whatever reason, I missed alot of the music and movies of my first decade.  Reading this book put me on a seemingly endless binge of 80's greatness!  I discovered and rediscovered so many great tv shows, movies, music, video games, comics, etc from that era just by reading Ready Player One and I was absolutely giddy and delighted.  I recommended the book immediately to all my friends and family.  I am a proud nerd by nature, but I think that anyone can enjoy this book.  I understand that Warner Brothers picked up the rights to make a movie out of it and here is hoping that they get it right, although I forsee alot of copyright issues that would need to be worked out because of the sheer amount of references made throughout the book.  Dig out your old atari, throw on some Cure, and read it now!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Got this as the FAOTD and I'm pretty pleased with it, but as I've been playing there are some parts I'm not too keen on.  The good: The ability to have auto zoom and also to only view available tiles are great features when screen space is a.high commodity. Also, the various gameplay modes and power tiles add a bit of a new twist to the classic Mahjong game.  The not so good: So far I've only played quest mode (with a story and pieces to gather from different locations) and the fact that the tile sets change to reflect the area you are in is neat, HOWEVER, this causes some confusion. As with other Mahjong games, there are some sets you can match by theme (examples include flowers or you could match various season tiles). When the tile sets change, there's no way to know which are these sets (I thought the floored scarabs in the Egypt section were these types of tiles but you had to match the same colors for these tiles).  All in all it's a well designed game and fun for passing the time and has nice features included. On the Fire it does seem to be a bit of a battery drainer.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|very cool story mode. Only bad thing about story mode is there is no way of knowing which levels youve completed or not. has tutorial at the beginning which can be very helpful if you have never played. Has power ups to help when you get stuck in a level. So far so good :)
B006ON41FC|5.0|going nuts is a blast. easy to play and hours of fun. anyone can play and have some fun trying to beat their friends.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun! Addicting! I have never played Mahjong before but found it easy to catch on. I have not noticed any adds so far.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|So I didn't find Catching Fire to be as thrilling and exciting as The Hunger games, but it added a lot of background to the characters and, in doing so, more realism to them.<br /><br />I'm off to read #3 now, I'm hoping for a favourable ending, but who knows. Suzanne may make it a not so nice ending.

B005723JSQ|5.0|I have loved reading any of Sophie Kinsella's books since the beginning with the Shoppaholic Series. This is just another one on to add to the list of favorites. Poppy is such a fun and refreshing character that you fall in love with her the moment you meet her. And Sam. I knew under that tough guy there was a lovable guy that you would be routing for to win the girl. I can't wait for Kinsella's next book. The year long wait is always torture.

0439023513|2.0|(No big spoilers here)  The first person narrative that is so effective in the first two books is the downfall of Mockingjay.  Because after a few chapters, you realize that you are occupying the mind of a sullen, moody, self-involved, immature teenager, and there is no escape.  From the first person perspective, it would have been great to see Katniss growing wiser and seeing further as the series progressed. This would have actually been a good match for the broad scope of the book - a full scale civil war. But instead we are treated to an anti-arc for her and other characters, as Collins takes delight in demonstrating what broken victims they have become.  It is almost like the author was in a dark place in her life, and having her main characters hide in closets and lose control of their minds and bodies was the cathartic result. So Katniss, along with the reader, becomes someone you just wish would be put out of her misery.  Apart from the characters, the other issue here is the plot.  So many things seem so arbitrary and unbelievable, it's almost like the author was just making it up as she went along.  Ohh yes, that is what writers do! But when suspension of disbelief is broken again and again, and you find yourself talking to the book saying \\"what??\\", it's not a good situation.  A well written book feels authentic in its own universe, and this one often does not.  And while I feel that an actual happy ending would have been wrong for this dark-edged series, the completely unmeaningful ending we are given just seems rushed and unsatisfying.  I admire Suzanne Collins for creating the Hunger Games and some very engaging characters, but this last installment just does not take the series anywhere near the heights it could have reached.  I wish she had taken an extra year to do it right, because based on the first two books she clearly has it in her.  The book reads like an early draft that just doesn't work.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love it.! just wish I had a camera on my kindle. I feel like this is what I was needing every time I had the itch to buy a paper blank or a scrapbook or a pea or new phone.

0739311123|2.0|So far it's an ok book...nothing special, and certainly nothing that I haven't heard a million times before. I do, however, see that Mitch Albom experienced a profound change as a result of this time with Morrie, and that was a real benefit for him. More when I finish...<br /><br />After finishing this book, I have concluded that it would have probably been a slam dunk for me had Mitch Albom told the personal story of his relationship with Morrie, and especially concentrated on their final thesis and how it impacted him. Instead, he wrote a book trying to universalize Morrie's aphorisms (which were nothing new to most people), and it fell completely flat for me. The personal transformation that Mitch underwent as a result of this experience was powerful, and yet he provided very little of that. I was disappointed...for me, it did not live up to the hype.<br /><br />As an afterthought, I did not like the narration either. For some reason, it got on my nerves. However, some of Mitch & Morrie's original conversations were added on at the end, and those were very interesting. In fact, they made what was a subpar listening experience worth listening to the end.
0807014273|5.0|I had the good fortune of knowing my great-grandfather, may he rest in peace, for the first ten years of my life. Being a Holocaust survivor, my great-grandfather always had a story or piece of wisdom to share with my family when we visited. He gave my father Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl as a gift and it remains one of my father's favorite books to this day. Although I was too young to read the book at the time, I know now that it rings truth in a new perspective on the Holocaust. My ancestors survived the horrors that the Nazis inflicted upon them, and they lived to tell me the tale. In an engaging and fascinating way, Frankl sheds some light as to how exactly people made it out of the concentration camps alive, with a will to live and with hope for the future.  In the first part of the book, Frankl describes his personal experiences as a prisoner in the Nazi concentration camps. He traces the mental state of an average prisoner in the camps, beginning upon arrival, and through liberation.  Frankl writes that after the initial shock of reaching the infamous camp, a prisoner would be overcome by a \\"delusion of reprieve\\", an irrational feeling of hope that his situation would somehow be changed for the better. However, after being separated from loved ones in the dreaded selections, and watching them walk towards the gas chambers to their deaths, the reality and horrification of it all dawned upon the prisoner. Frankl describes the next emotional stage as \\"relative apathy\\", which was a complete weakening of the prisoner's senses and feelings, leaving a body merely going through the motions of everyday camp routine rather than a person. According to Frankl, apathy was essential for the preservation of a prisoner's life, because it channeled every emotion he had towards the goal of making it through the day alive. The third and final stage that a prisoner experienced was the complete inability to grasp the meaning of freedom. Following this the prisoner would have to re-learn what emotions such as joy and pleasure meant. Throughout this development, there still remains the question: what were the thoughts that gave a prisoner the drive to live, completely necessary for the conservation of his life? Frankl provides answers to this question in the second section of the book.  Throughout the book, Frankl often quotes Nietzsche: \\"He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how.\\" In the second section, Frankl elaborates on how this phrase sums up, in a nutshell, the mentality with which he survived the war. Having a purpose in life, writes Frankl, is the key to withstanding almost any suffering. Frankl named his theory \\"logotherapy\\", since logos is Greek for meaning. A method employed in psychology, \\"logotherapy\\" causes a patient to pinpoint and become familiar with the meaning of his life, which according to Frankl is the patient's will to strive, succeed, and to live. Frankl goes on to suggest three ways in which one can strive for meaning. The first one, understandably, is to accomplish something. Additionally, meaning can be found by loving another. Finally, man can find meaning by suffering. When one is faced with suffering, and there is nothing he can do to change his predicament, the only remaining option is for him to change his perspective, to change the way in which he views the situation. An example that Frankl gives is of a story of a grieving widower who had lost his wife. The man came to Frankl to ask for advice. Frankl asked the man, \\"What would have happened...if you had died first and your wife would have had to survive without you?\\" Through this question, the suffering the man was enduring gained a new purpose, he was mourning, but his wife would not have to mourn him. This story illustrates the usage of \\"logotherapy\\", and how by using it, one can utilize his suffering and find meaning through it.  The Holocaust and World War II is a time in world history that has been studied and pondered by many scholars. There are volumes upon volumes written about this dark time in history. Man's Search for Meaning is unique because Frankl focuses on the psychology of it all. He brings proofs to back up his claim that man's search for meaning is, in and of itself, a will to live. Through starvation, sickness, torture and brutality, surrounded by death and despair, man can endure it all, he can even gain something from it, so long as he has a reason to keep going. Each individual has a different source of meaning, yet no matter what the cause, the meaning alone is what gives that man the drive to wake up each morning and endure whatever life sends his way. Even when faced with death itself, man can survive if he has a reason to.  This book was written specifically about the Holocaust and the concentration camps. Nonetheless, there is a life-changing lesson that one can learn from reading the book, no matter what his life circumstances may be. Life is full of challenges, but those challenges eventually cause a person to question who he is and what he stands for, thereby forcing him to determine the meaning in his life. No matter where a person comes from, and no matter where he is headed, he must have a purpose in his life in order to move forward, and to be able to look back at the end of his life and feel proud of all that he accomplished. In a brilliant and insightful way, Victor Frankl has ultimately handed his readers the key to success and happiness, and the answer to many questions; he has affirmed that above all, meaning is what makes life worth living.

0895260131|5.0|An amazing resource for refuting the historical revisionists of Islamic Imperialism. I especially enjoyed the Crusades segments which has augmented my own research and writing on the subject matter. I highly recommend Spencer's book. For further research one may investigate the following title: Mecca, Muhammad & the Moon-god: A Candid Investigation into the Origins of Islam

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a page turner. I found that I liked the author's pace, and how you didn't have every agonizing detail explained when trying to describe a scene (3 paragraphs on the shrubs, etc). Many critic's review didn't like the beleiveable-factor. This book is set in the future, and if you think about it, between mankind's history with gladiators and concentration camps, this type of story-line isn't too far fetched. Great read.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Very fun game. Well worth the price. A little tougher then you may think. But very very enjoyable. Don't let the cutest graphics fool you. Works great on the kindle fire
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book picks off shortly after the first ended. I love the twist with Katniss, and the ending was very unexpected and made me want to jump and get the thrid book immediately!
B0029LB2V4|5.0|This was an amazing series. I couldn't get enough of it. I sat down and watched season 1-4 within a week because I was so sucked in. The casting is great. It is both a happy and sad series. Amazing :)
B007B8GI28|4.0|It's unfortunate that FRANK DARABONT didn't get to have his hand in this season. I'm still enjoying the new episodes, but I want to know more about what's going on with T-DOG and DALE. The female characters seem to be causing more problems. SHANE is going to do something stupid. I can just feel it. SHANE needs to go.  I have to admit I love the fact the group had a chance to take a breather on the farm as constantly being attacked by the walking dead is a little too much, but I think everyone has been ready for the stakes to be raised a little more. It's only been about 2 weeks since RICK woke up at the hospital and around 6 days that the group has been on the farm. Why hasn't a herd of walkers stumbled across HERSHEL GREENE's farm? I find it hard to believe that a place could be that safe.  What ever happened to MORGAN & DUANE? Whatever happened to MERLE? At the end of Season 1 DR. JENNER said the French were the longest ones to hold out looking for a cure. He whispered something into RICK's ear. What did he whisper? Is there ever going to be a pay off for that?  I love seeing the character arcs change. Can't wait for more.
B0025X5WSU|5.0|I am so happy that I got back to watching this. When I couldnt watch because I didnt have showtime I was upset. Then I got prime and I watched all the seasons with in a week, but its sad because I wish there was more. The series was so well done. Sad that it had to end. Season 2 was just fantastic. :)
0316017930|4.0|After reading the book Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, I wouldn't compare this to your average book. Outliers is a book about success and the different aspects of success. What it takes to get to that successful point by looking at lucky breaks, age, ethnicity, IQ level, money, and motivation. The many examples in the book about all of the points that I have just mentioned are all relevant to the book and to our society. The author pulls off this difficult topic very well I think because he organizes it in a way that he is able to make his points and make them all in the best way possible. He organizes each of the topics into a different section and sometimes by closing them off by chapters to make the topic as meaningful as possible.   This book is also an easy read because of the style that it is written. It has more of a laid back feel to it because it more so discusses each of the topics rather then lectures the reader on them. He goes over the facts and points out with specific examples why they are true. If I had to pick a down fall to this book it would be that some readers do like structure and the way that this is structured isn't the normal chapters and paragraphs.   Overall I think that Malcolm Gladwell did a magnificent job in pointing out outliers and analyzing what it takes for people to become successful basically in any type of field. This book is rated very well by me and highly recommended. Personally, after reading this book the key to success that stands out the most would be motivation. Strive for what it is that you desire. If there's something that is out there that you know you really want, go for it and never give up.
0553381695|4.0|A Clash of Kings is a direct follow-up to the events in A Game of Thrones. It's slower-paced, has a broader and more complex plot, and ends on an incomplete note with a near unnoticable climax. It also has the feel of an interim novel, with slow plot development while many of the characters are shuffled around to take their respective places.  Political intrigue remains the mainstay of the story, though battle and warfare takes a significant share of the book as well; still, characters and their development are central to the story. More-so, given the slower pace and the large amount of plot set-up which is involved, there's a greater reliance on characters to keep the reader interested in the story. Whether you find these sections interesting depends on how much you like each respective character and want to know more about them.  I think the main problem for some of the characters, without plot development and most of the book spent moving around, just aren't that interesting. On the other hand, the characters who are involved in actively moving plots benefit, and those characters who one finds likeable benefit disproportionately. There are also two new character viewpoints, and while both provide necessary viewpoints with ample plot development there are still growing pains in getting used to them.  As mentioned, the plotting is slower here. The benefit of this is that Martin has the room to give the politics time to develop, to show things of relevance for future events, and to add depth and texture to the story. The downside is that it takes a long time, which is compounded by the scattering of characters. In A Game of Thrones the plotting was much tighter by having several clusters of perspectives around certain plotlines, where-as in this book the development of plots has to be spread out over single perspectives, with their own character movements to boot.  We see more of magic here, a number of different systems reminiscent of Tolkien, or Guy Gavriel Kay'slatter works. This sometimes has the feel of deus ex machina, but remains interesting and intriguing for the better part.  Not so captivating as A Game of Thrones, but this book feels like a necessary step to move into the next phase, and i'm still intrigued enough to be eager to continue.  4/5

Wow!.....That is a Classic, beautifully arranged and Whitney still holding the note. We will surely miss this ANGEL!.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a great bible. The one bad thing about it is you need internet access to highlight, bookmark, and make notes. I have downloaded another Bible that I use for offline use and use this one only when at home (Kindle Fire only has Wi-Fi, wouldn't pay for 4G even if it was an option.) Other than that, it is amazing. You can download more than 15 different translations, which really comes in handy when comparing different versions. You can see the flaws in certain versions like the NIV that removes God from a number of verses and changes what Jesus said. Even goes so far as to inter-mix Jesus with Lucifer.    You can read more on this on [...]

B000002VMH|5.0|Annie Lennox<br /><br />Diva<br /><br />Annie Lennox has a great voice but has not always had the greatest songs.  Even in her Eurythmics albums, there had been a glut of fillers among the greats.  In this solo album, Annie gives us a very beautiful collection of songs with no hit of filler, but her performance is too restrained.  This album leaves you with an impression that Annie is being to precise, to controlled, to give the songs the full power of her talent.  It makes you wish she would just cut loose and sing it from the heart instead of for the microphones.  Yet, with that being said, this is still a Great album.  Her restraint keeps this from being a true Masterpiece, but it is still a great one.  Five Stars.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I loved the first two books.  But this one needs to be entitled, Mockery-Jay:  The Girl Who was on Fire is Snuffed Out.
B00365EB88|5.0|AC/DC<br /><br />Iron Man 2<br /><br />While I enjoy some of AC/DC's better songs, the vocalists for AC/DC can really get on my nerves and so (in the absence of a Hits release) I have avoided buying their albums.  However, this disk has solved my dilemma.  This CD has the 15 best tracts from the band and it works perfectly as a hits package.  As such, it is fantastic!  This is a Five Star release.
0071752854|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1VP1X0QVX1SAT]]If you're like most people, when you read this book it's going to completely reframe what you think about selling and how you do it. If you're looking to increase your sales I'm not going to tell you that Oren's formula is your only chance, but as you'll discover, it's definitely your best chance! Get the book, apply what you learn and then be amazed at your new results!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen (self-titled debut)<br /><br />I came in late as far as this group is concerned.  I knew their songs from the radio (of course) but had only bought their `hits' CD, which I did not like.  So now, decades later, I'm hearing their actual albums for the first time.  This debut album is simply brilliant!  This is a solid five star release.
B000000P17|5.0|I'm a fan of Guns n' Roses, well, the original lineup.  Granted, I realize the lineup present when this album was recorded had a different drummer and rhythm guitarist.  So, obviously not quite the same band, but Slash and Duff were still there (at the time).  That worked.<br /><br />I only bought this album because I didn't have it and plus I needed to fulfill the $25 supersaver option.  Otherwise, I wouldn't have.  Don't get me wrong. I think it's a good album.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Student Review:  The Hunger Games is a brilliantly written book in which Collins captures your attention from the very start. The main characters Katniss and Peeta are very believable and often have you relating them to people you know, Katniss the strong but hurting character, and Peeta the sweet and caring character. The Hunger Games has very few dull moments. It keeps you glued to the story for hours. Several times I found myself still reading that \\"1 more chapter\\" several hours, and chapters later. At several points in this book I found myself thinking of other books or real life sittuations with similar scenarios one example of this is on page 344. When Katniss suggest a double suicide the book also referrs to Katniss and Peeta as \\"star crossed lovers\\" multiple times. This seems to be a reference to Romeo and Juliet, but with a different end result. Another example of these links is the 13 districts. The 13 districts with one unreachable oppressive leader should make many think back to history class. With the 13 colonies and their oppressive leader, England. Whether these were intentional or not the link is still present. In all I would say this is a very well written and paced book great for passing time, or enjoying a great story. I would recommend this to everyone.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|I just keep replaying this, wearing my headset and listening to it over and over. It's amazing.  *** YOU MIGHT WANT TO SKIP THIS RANT ***  Long story short on how I learned about this amazing show (He's lying, it's still kind of long).  I heard all the talk a while ago about Susan Boyle singing a song \\"I dreamed a dream\\" on the X-factor. I Love to Hate Simon Cowell so I had to go see what he's up to and to listen to this song. I was blown away by the song and Susan Boyle's voice, listening to it over and over. Then I decided to go see what this \\"Les Miserables\\" was.  I looked it up and still didn't think much about it, but one night I saw it was going to be on PBS and decided to record it. Days, maybe weeks later, I was bored and as I flipped through my recordings and saw Les Miserables. I saw the recording time, and it seemed really long. I didn't know if I wanted to invest that much time into this thing I really had never heard of. Well, I decided to play this \\"Les Miserables\\" recording, thinking I'd probably hate it and end up just skipping through to see the song Susan Boyle sung, then deleting it.  WOW, I was so wrong. I watched it non-stop, and then watched it again.  I must have watched it 5 times now and listened to it 50 times over the past few months.  I am still amazed at how I went through life without even knowing about this, never mind not seeing it. I would always bring my daughters to new shows or other forms of art as they grew up, but for some reason I totally missed this over the last 26 years.  I have to thank Simon Cowell, Susan Boyle and PBS for eventually leading me to this show. I even donated to PBS for bringing me this (AND Celtic Women).  I have been repeatedly watching my PBS recording of the 25th anniversary version and got tired of the breaks and donation requests (I donated already, geesh), so I ordered this. I also ordered the 10th anniversary edition AND the standard DVD version. My daughters with each get one and I'll keep one to replay one over and over.  *** END RANT ***  Overall, I think the cast was amazing. It was so good that I wanted to do some research just to see who all these amazing people were. Nick did seem to have some tough spots, but he wasn't THAT bad. However, he was a bit overshadowed by the rest of the amazing cast. Lea Salonga and Katie Hall were good. Jenny Galloway, Matt Lucas and Ramin Karimloo were amazing. Even the younger actors Mia Jenkins and Robert Madge did an amazing job, and on such a big stage.  I REALLY enjoyed Norm Lewis and Alfie Bow - all I can say is WOW. But Samantha Banks was WICKED amazing. With all three of these actors, their amazing voices along with their mannerisms and facial expressions really made you *feel* what they were going through, and you could really sympathize with them.  I am SO glad Ms. Banks got that part in the upcoming movie. I can NOT wait to see that.  If you go through life without seeing this, you will have missed something REALLY special. I almost did. Thank gawd I love to hate Simon Cowell...

B003YL4LYI|2.0|I became a fan after reading the first book in the series. It was not surprising that I devoured the next two and waited anxiously for book number four. Like many others I was very disappointed with A Feast For Crows and was hoping that the author will compensate with this book. The author kept saying that most of the popular characters will be covered in this book so the expectation was even higher.<br /><br />Now after reading this book, I must admit I am not eager to know how this story ends or whether there is going to be another book closing the series. Although the writing style is good as ever, the plot does not advance and the few shocking turns during the plot are undone by simple kids realms solutions where the heroes never die. That is also the reason why the ending, which was quite extreme, did not leave a taste of wanting to find out more since the hunch is that it will be resolved with a turn that will take all the surprise away...<br /><br />Just to convey the level of distrust I now hold I can say that when I read in the previous books that Bran and Rickon were killed, I stopped reading having the saddest feeling I had from a book and I could not stop talking about it with my wife for 2 days. In this book however, when anything like that happened to a character I like very much, I did not feel anything and I just did not care. I only checked the number of the page I was at to know how long more I need to endure this reading.<br /><br />A marvelous series that started in the most promising way, just crashed head on into a concrete wall. A shame.
B0062NAX1U|4.0|This movie centers around the main theme of Jesus Christ first and then family second. I like the way the movie set the scene for the importance of family and to make every day count. Some parts of the movie were a little corny but that is what happens when non-movie maker put together a movie and that is why I gave it a 4.

B000BRBA8S|2.0|This movie is so boring.  It spends 2 hours talking about the same thing over and over. They have someone speaking Japanese to someone who is speaking back in Chinese.  The conversation does not make any sense at all. The only thing I like is the Spanish song.  But there is only one.  They play the same song over and over for 2 hours.
B0068TL23G|4.0|agree with previous post about saving high score.  it is annoying at best to redo a level and lose points.  also android market has an update, where is the update on here.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a woman executive on a business trip to China.  Coming home she brings back more than a few souvenirs! She contracts a deadly virus that spreads like wild fire and is contagious by touch and body fluids (sneezing and coughing).  Death comes within a few days and those who catch this flu have a 25 % to 30% chance to die.<br /><br />Governments are paralyzed in trying to find the source of the disease and a possible cure.  Even if a cure is found how can you quickly immunize billions of people worldwide?  Normal people are rioting and stealing from each other......<br /><br />This movie is a possible scenario of another Spanish Flu type epidemic where 50 to 100 million people died from 1918 to 1920 and 500 million were infected.  Based on today's population the figure would be over 3.5 times worse.  This movie is based on an actual potential disaster and it clearly shows how mankind is totally unprepared for such an event.<br /><br />The movie was pretty good and characters of Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) and Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) were played pretty well.  Where the movie fell down is that there is just too much data thrown at the audience and it may be difficult for some people to get their arms around the storyline.  The story also jumped in the timeline multiple times and you really have to follow closely or possibly get lost.<br /><br />I thought the movie was above average but not spectacular.
B005VQRPME|5.0|You know that Getz/Gilberto is one of the all-time great jazz recordings. If you were around back in 1964, bought the Verve LP, and owned high-quality audio equipment, you also know it is one one of the best sounding records ever.<br /><br />I purchased an early CD release of Getz/Gilberto and was disappointed that the warm, intimate sound of the original LP was somehow lost. It turns out I was not the only one. Many classic analog recordings have made a happy transition to CD. Why not this one?<br /><br />Now along comes this latest SACD from Analogue Productions, and it is pricey. (While working from the original tapes, the production team found and fixed a major error dating back to the album's original release: the channels were reversed!)<br /><br />As this great album approaches its 50th birthday, has Analogue Productions finally recaptured that elusive magical sound?<br /><br />Update: Thanks for your comments and recommendations. I urge other reviewers to make clear what CD reissue/remix you're listening to, since Amazon continues to lump together all reviews of all versions.

B005FJ7DOM|2.0|The only reason why I watched this film (to the end) was because I spent $3.99 and didn't want to waste my money. Even though, looking back on it now, I ended up wasting my time instead. It's not that it was a horrible film - the cinematography was good, the acting wasn't bad, and the scenery fit the essence of the film quite well - there were just too many things that bothered me about it.<br /><br />Potential Spoilers:<br /><br />For starters, \\"Mister\\" left a lot to be desired. The script was essentially written around this character - he was the one providing hope to a desperate people, he was coming against the Brotherhood - but I'm not quite sure if it was the casting or a poor development in the script that just seemed to throw everything off. For as much faith as they put into Mister, it seemed that he should've been this larger-than-life character. To me, he just wasn't \\"that guy\\" and when you're writing a script around a single character ... he really needs to be \\"the guy.\\" That was probably the biggest upset for me.<br /><br />But I could go on and go - how the main boy in the film didn't seem too upset that his parents were brutally eaten alive by vampires, that \\"Mister\\" killed his dad and he seemed to be OK with that, the pregnant girl's belly grew at a ridiculously rapid rate (the time just didn't seem to match), there was little practicality in the film (they stop and siphon gas out of other cars, they hunt for food, they look for clean water, etc, etc) - but I'll just end with saying that I really wanted to like this movie. There were a few parts that could've made it a great film, but it just seemed lacking in too many areas for me.

B007B8EX9I|3.0|This series was fantastic. The content of the miniseries would be 4 stars on its own, with some episodes rating a 5. Maggie Smith as always steals every scene she is in, delivering her one-liners with regal aplomb to amusing effect. The sisters are not quite so horrible to each other as they were in the first season - so it's nice to see some of the cattiness go away.  The viewing quality, on a 32\\" TV, was horrendous. If you're watching this on the Kindle Fire, it's probably fine - but a standard size TV looked horribly pixelated (and this from the copy I'd downloaded to my laptop. While the show itself often distracted me from the annoying squares on the screen, most of the time I spent watching it regretting my purchase. Downton Abbey is a wonderfully visual experience, with great shots, costumes, acting ... I just wish I could have seen it as it was meant to be seen. Probably 2 Stars for the viewing quality on a normal TV. I wish there had been some warning. I would probably have purchased the HD version given the chance, but by the time I'd realized my mistake, I'd already downloaded half the movies, and had already purchased the TV pass.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game! I will say my finger hurts from swyping though:) definitely buying the new one. Thank you!
B004I1WIWU|3.0|I like this CD a lot more than I thought I would. I bought it for my wife, and very quickly grew to like much of it.<br /><br />But... Seriously? You take a fine talent, good heart wrenching tunes, and mix it and master it like amateurs.<br />Brick-wall mastering is never tollerable, but one can almost forgive it on Green Day, Rancid, Spinnerett CD's, but Adele? Come on!! This is sad and pathetic. The opening track is clipped and harsh almost to the point of un-listenabiltiy. These songs and this woman deserves better. Putting out a CD with shoddy production values doesn't help anyone.<br /><br />But, fortunately this album has succeded in spite of it's ridiculous lack of dynamics and hyper compressed and 'Loudness Wars' mastering.<br /><br />Adele does not have a voice like Ella. That's a given, it's raspy and raw, but it's emotional and emotive. It works. I like it. I like the manner in which she performs her songs. The arrangements are mostly good, though a couple verge on the derivitive side of pop... or R&B.<br /><br />I hope the Vynil LP is better... I'm planning to get it. At least they can't 'brick wall' it... though it too can be mastered poorly.<br /><br />EDIT:  I received the Vinyl LP, and ripped it at 24bit/96khz. The sonics and dynamics are far superior to the CD. Some songs are better than others. Set Fire to the Rain is similar because of the pre-mastering, which killed all the dynamics and flattened it to one volume. Running in the Deep is a revelation as it was not mastered to 'brick' form and has very good dynamic bandwidth. The difference is truly night and day on some songs like that one.<br /><br />That said, what the LP has allowed me to do is see how poorly several of these songs are recorded and mixed and pre-mastered. Some are produced very well, and others are amateurish and pathetic. But only the LP will allow you to truly hear Adele, and only on about half the songs. This is quite a disservice to her, the songs, and the musicians who played on this album. Hey Adele, find the better producer and use that person for the entire album. That way you won't have such a hodge-podge of variations from song to song, and your talent won't be overshadowed by pathetic production values.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I would give this game 4 stars due to the brevity, but I add the extra star for those who obviously don't even care for this type of game but feel free to voice their opinion.  Don't expect the map to let you jump to the screen you want to go to.  That isn't how it works.  Its not meant to be an exciting action game but is very well done for fans of games like Myst.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|LOVE ITT!!' It is a awesome game but hard now and then. Even though it money its worth it when you get it you will agree with me trust me.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I'm new to Chess Free (on the Kindle) and this is the BEST game EVER!!! I'm completely addicted!!! *Don't knock it until you've tried it. You wont want to put it down:)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Does what it should, provides a great distraction without requiring &quot;frenzied&quot; action or intense concentration. it's solitaire at its finest.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always enjoyed this version of solitaire over the original.....and now I am able to play it on my kindle whenever I want!
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|I really enjoyed this series until the last few chapters of the 3rd and final book.  Up until then, it was an engaging story that held my attention and wasn't as ridiculously long as some other teen series.  I'm not usually a reader of fiction, but this summer I read Hunger Games and really enjoyed it.  So I bought the whole trilogy for my kindle.  I just can't understand why Collins took so much time to build these characters through 3 books and then wasted it all at the end.  I thought the ending sounded as though a completely different writer finished the story.  IMO it was not at all true to character or to the tone of the entire rest of the story.  It honestly made me mad that I'd wasted so much time on the rest of it.  It just seemed that the author gave up, finished in a hurry or was forced to change the ending to appease a publisher.  I would have rated it one star, but other than the ending, the story was excellent.  Hopefully, they'll fix it when they do the movies...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|game is fun....helps pass the time and provides some entertainment! anyone who likes mini arcade style games would love.this app!
B004SRNH10|3.0|this app is ok I can't figure out how to get it to download to my phone it keeps locking up on me
B0054JZC6E|3.0|they are not very intricate games. but you get 121 of them for free. works great on the kindle fire.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Simple to install, works as it was advertised, inexpensive. I am pleased with the converter. It was shipped in a timely fashion an arrived in the time frame that was expressed. Amazon did it for me again.  Thanks.  Stephen
B005LAIGLE|4.0|This movie was  not the highest rated movie, however, it was exciting, filled with action and very good.  It was fast paced with adult language which was appropriate to the scenes.  Would highly recommend it  for an evening of entertainment.
B005TZFZ9W|5.0|The album flows very well. A very good album, if you like finally famous and carter 4 you will very well like this album..maybe even more after you listen to it more than once. He definitely is out shining everyone in his age bracket the wiz and big sean of the world and it shows with this album ..he is more than rack city he is a artist and a super star in the making
B004UID2LC|4.0|I downloaded this app for my kindle fire. It is amazing! it lets me download anything that I want off of youtube, and goes straight to your gallery. it doesn't take very long to load and doesn't freeze or make you wait to watch the video. however, on some videos longer than about 30 min, it always stops the video in the same place every time I watch it. That needs some work and fast because I need to know who won wipeout!:) I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to pay to buy music from iTunes or anywhere else. save your money and get this instead
B005HSL626|1.0|don't try to downlade this game it well rip u off so just don't download. this game so don't buy it
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am a solitaire lover. This version is definitely a step up from the version on my blackberry curve. I enjoy the one-tap play capability, as well as the undo button for those times when I wasn't actually ready to deal more cards yet. This would be 5 stars if not for the ads. I understand that most free apps are ad-supported. But you have to go through an ad every time you deal, no matter how short or long your previous game was. Get a couple bad deals and you could be seeing multiple ads within 5 minutes. I assume they want the ads to feel invasive so you'll buy a paid version.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|watch it and tell me i am wrong. Loved the soundtrack too. 5-5 all around for this movie. If you gave it a 1-5 shame on you.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|Seriously, please don't do it. Save yourself some time, and just punch yourself in the junk. It's about as rewarding as this movie.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I didn't get a chance to play the full game because of the MANDATORY tutorial. Nothing against tutorials, when they work... But this one would not allow me to get past it because it would not select the tiles on my Vizio tablet.  From what I read here,  I probably would have uninstalled it anyways because of the ads. Too bad it didn't get the chance to spam me with them.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|kind of a typical mahjong game but fun nonetheless. lovely game for my fire. I enjoy the different tile sets and quest mode.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|I knew I would enjoy Hairspray because I had viewed it before ordering.  The music the dancing just a very pleasant movie.  I would recommend the DVD to anyone.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Going Nuts is a great game for all ages. This is my sons favorite game and mine as well!!!!!!! Going to snowland is my favorite part
B005MJ883K|5.0|Fun for all, excellent product. Challenging, will be picking it up again and again. Good for travel or a boreing rainy day.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoy this game for two reasons. The first is that the difficulty builds up. The first levels start off easy, to build up some confidence, and then get progressively more difficult. The second thing I like about it is that it is not just a collection of different layouts. There is a quest, so besides just solving the puzzles for that sake of solving it, you are gathering pieces to a different puzzle along the way. It might not be much, but I find it more entertaining.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool fun game really like it. alsom coolly cool. cool cool cool fun fun fun fun play it I do all the time
B006ON41FC|4.0|this game is just as addicting as temple run on my gfs iphone and now I need more words to submit
B00005N6KG|2.0|I bought these earphones based on all the good reviews.  The sound was good, seemed sturdy enough for just treadmill running, and I was looking forward to at least a year of usability.  Unfortunately, the sound started to go out and get spotty acutely during a run and it's very annoying.  Lasted about 6 months so obviously I didn't get to a year.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is one of the good games of its kind! One flow though is you have to earn most of the games.
0307957934|2.0|I tried four times to read this book.  The characters were shallow, and extremely confusing.  Maybe it has more to do the financial and computer technology that I found so completely uninteresting.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this is a fun new twist on a classic. the story mode gives u a larger goal and mission to complete.
0525478817|5.0|I stopped by to see if everyone loves this book as much as I do!  You love it, you really love it!  I bought this book after reading its recommendation in both People and Entertainment Weekly.  I whole-heartedly agree with Entertainment Weekly's assessment -- when a movie is made of this book, PLEASE Hollywood, don't toy with a great thing.  And now to Facebook to find John Green ...
B004O3YGMC|2.0|Discovery dies not work over Verizon data service. This severely cripples the usefulness of the software. Works very well over wifi
B006ON41FC|4.0|I like it but whenever I play it turns the screen upside down whenever I play.It is fun and cute.
B006ON41FC|3.0|At first I had a lot of fun with this despite the annoying plea for me to rate it five stars. Let me play awhile before you start nagging me over and over and over to give you the best possible rating. I've played the game quite a bit. Am currently stuck on a goal to get 10 gold nuts and no others. I can't figure out how. Is it possible? I can't figure out what else to try. But my biggest criticism is that despite having different goals to achieve it is really the exact same gameplay every time. Same background, same obstacles to avoid. No matter how well I do its the same game but with different goals. Not sure how much longer I'll play this.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game. Lots of different patterns to choose from. The music is soothing as well. It's a keeper. Buy it for your family.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love this cover...not only does it keep my kindle safe from dust but it is very classy looking.  I have gotten lots of compliments on it.
B005H5H3LW|4.0|I had been a fan of Star Blazers since I was a kid and when I was ordering the first season on DVD I discovered they had a made a live action version of Space Battleship Yamato. I checked out the trailer on youtube and was impressed with the high production value so I ordered it. I have to say I was impressed. I bought my version from the highest rated seller and I found it to be a very good quality. As for the movie, the action, acting, and special effects were very good. There are some differences from the anime of course. After all they are squeezing a 26 episode anime into a 2 hour movie. The general plot is the same. The Gamilons are portrayed differently (Not really human). I agree with one of the other reviewers that they didn't give the ship enough screen time which was disappointing since the Yamato/Argo is its own character in a way. There is no English dub of this movie. There are english subtitles for this movie which are done well. Usually Japanese to english subtitles are done as literal translations which can make for awkward and disjointed reading but not in this case. My only problem with the subtitles was that they were hard to read and take in all the action at the same time. Now that I've seen it I don't think I would watch an english version of this movie. It would take away some of the emotional impact of the good acting. If your a fan of Starblazers/Yamato I recommend this movie. If your a purist I say read the other reviews and decide for yourself.
B006UG90RM|4.0|The songs had a great edge to it...funky, hard, mean...think Eruption. And there were many great songs! All with some edge, yet offered a variety: metal, thrash, bluesy, rock, etc.  Eddie COMPLETELY blows the roof off with his guitar work. Get *another* guitar award ready.  Also, Alex's drumming really stood out. Really fresh, popping, keeping the energy high. He led parts when needing too, yet followed Eddie's lead when needing too. Really great.  The bass? Well, nothing against Wolfgang (I like him), but I'm too biased toward Michael Anthony. I related to him the most. But hey, the bass was hard, in sync...no complaints. Good job.  Dave's vocals were hit and miss. Dave's vocals worked quite well for most of the songs (e.g., the bluesy Stay Frosty, Big River). For other songs, Dave's vocals (and the backup vocals...yikes...really missed Anthony there) just didn't match the new edginess. Bottom line: Dave can still bring it...just don't let him go off on a ramble...it's creepy (e.g., the second half of The Trouble with Never; otherwise a solid song).  In all, a great metal album!!! Not a great metal album for an older band...no...it's really a great metal album!!! Metal bands (young and old) around the world are dropping their jaws right now. I actually took my first cruise in decades because of this album. It made me feel good about life...and that is what rock is all about.  Van Halen brought it and then some! Thanks guys.
1846142733|5.0|I found this book to be outstanding. It presented a well founded multi-part thesis and provided comprehensive substantiating information to support his results. It gave a clear picture of how Western Civilization progressed and left the reader with an understanding of why that civilization is slipping after turning away from the characteristics that lead it to greatness. I recommend this book to be taught in both university and high-school level Civics, History and Economic courses.
B002BWP49M|1.0|This must be one of the worst of the movie series.  The movie needs to be renamed \\"Breaking Yawn\\".  Go watch Kristen Stewart in Wonderland instead.  Her performance was amazing in that much better movie.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|got this game on the daily free app and it is very addictive so far. my grandson likes the endless mode. if you like mahjong this one would be worth purchasing.
B002N8A14M|4.0|I purchased this case a little over 1 year ago.  I liked the fact that it was a hard case (protects the screen) and has a clip for situations when you might not want/need the armband.  The case also provides easy access to all the ipod control panels.  The clip takes a little effort to detach from the armband, but it is do-able.  One issue I found with this product is the hard plastic of the case is formed in a way which can be incompatible with some headphones/earbuds if the connector is L-shaped or more bulky than the official ipod headphones with straight connectors.  The second issue I found was related to durability of the product.  A little after a year of owning this product I was out running in a park and the case seperated at the seam, which is used to install the ipod into the plastic hard case, and swung up via my headphone's cord and hit me in the face!  It seems the plastic clasps holding the two parts of the case together wear down over time...maybe from the force of gravity as a person is working out (running, jumping, etc).  So, it is a good case to protect your ipod, but buyer beware or you too could get clipped in the face by your ipod.  :-p
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is easy to play and user friendly. The ads don't really bother me. Would be nice if it proposed more of a challenge.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I thought this app was great it is a very well thought out roll playing game its the new angry birds
B005M7P9XE|5.0|Excelent additional features. The concert is quite good and the quality of the sounds and images is outsanding!. The think I like the most is the mixture of pop music and classical music.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Game plays great, lots of fun. Haven't had any problems. There are ads but they do not get in the way of the game play.
0060734191|5.0|I read very little fantasy, but a trusted a friend's recommendation.  I was immediately sucked into this new world, described fully yet unobtrusively so that I never had to backtrack.  I didn't think of the words \\"necromancer\\" or \\"undead\\"; they just didn't fit with a story that isn't quite horror, and for me, that took a back seat to the very real characters.  It's been years since I regretted reaching the end of a book because I would miss my companions, but this made me feel like a kid, even with, well, zombies.
B003CTCGBM|5.0|Any Coltrane or Milt Jackson ( Bags ) fans should take advantage of this classic. Kinda Blue / Miles Davis and Take Five / Dave Brubeck are along this line of MUST HAVES if you listen to straight ahead jazz at all.

B004WPYNY8|4.0|This is my first experience with Symphony X.  I picked up this album hoping to hear some good progressive metal (not what I'm getting from Dream Theater these days) and that's what I got.  I can't speak to the band's history as many other reviewers but I can add my two cents in that I found this a compelling listen with some very good (and, yes, technical) music.  I found the drumming of Jason Rullo to be phenomenal, very engaging.  Yes, there is the prerequisite blistering and heavy guitar work of Michael Romeo across all of the songs on both discs (though he backs off quite a bit on \\"When All Is Lost\\").  The keyboards don't overpower any of the guitars, they provide a nice bed of different sounds and melodies and layering, and often sound like guitar parts themselves.  I appreciated the restraint of the keys on this work given how much, say, a Jordan Rudess can dominate a song in an uninspired fashion.  (For a fantastic usage of keys and synths check out Riverside's \\"Anno Domini High Definition\\".)  One thing that slightly holds me back is Russell Allen's vocals; they sound as if he is singing a bit deeper than his normal voice range would allow and so they sound a little forced to my ears; thank goodness he's not growling though.  As the lyrical and musical tone and story of this album are quite dark perhaps that is what he was going for but I think that if took just a little of the edge off his voice would sound better and the songs would benefit.  On the first disc the song \\"Iconoclast\\" is the standout track, providing a building intro that leads into the power of the song and album that is to follow.  On disc 2 I especially love the opening to \\"The Lords of Chaos\\" with its great heavy rhythyms and pulses building early on and then exploding.<br /><br />The lyrical story of the album seems to be like a Terminator tale, something along the lines of man becoming machine and then machine making war with and killing man.  There's a lot of Christian religious imagery in the lyrics but this band sounds like they reject all religion.  The apcalyptic story can be taken in a number of ways too: as a criticism of contemporary western society's fall into and binding with technology and becoming inextricably lost in it; as a story of man becoming the slave to whatever gods he creates, be they metal or false religions; as a sci-fi tale of man fighting to overcome what he is becoming.  But you're going to need to put in some of your own interpretation as the story isn't a tidy one and has big gaps.  The track \\"Bastards of the Machine\\" feels like the lyrical heart of the story.<br /><br />Lastly, the artwork of the album is awesome/ cool.  It makes me wish we were back in the days of vinyl and this was a bigger pic.  The interior artwork visually forwards the theme of man becoming machine.  Inventive, cool, eye-catching.  All in all a very good package and I think I'll be checking out some more of this band's catalog.rics but this band sounds like they reject all religion.

B004V2AWKG|5.0|Don't dismiss this book as \\"just\\" a young-adult novel; it will make you think and feel -- perhaps more than you want -- whether you're 12 or 91. Lowry creates a convincing world, beautiful and horrifying, and even though it hurt to read, I was never sorry. One of the most perfect books I've ever read.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Now this was a fully entertaining movie, grown up without being boring, whimsical as three men could be, and certainly worth seeing again.  No one stole the show or over-did anything.  Just an allstar cast, oddly great story, and humor interlaced throughout without becoming the entire purpose.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I find this a quick break from routine, and because each game is short, I don't get engrossed to continue.  But because each game is quick, it's easy to think &quot;just ONE more!&quot; The only drawback is the ad that pops up before each game, but 1 tap and it's gone.
0061251321|5.0|Outstanding book for self reflection, organization pulse and next steps for team building.  This book held the missing link for taking not only my plant, but the organization to another level.
0385738773|3.0|I really enjoyed reading the first two, and read the Death Cure in a day.  Yes, it's hard to put down.  BUT, there is one tragedy after another.  It gets really ridiculous after awhile.  They overcome one major catastrophe and then find themselves fighting Cranks/zombies, bombs, toxic chemicals, you name it, they overcome it.  I was very disappointed that Thomas' memories were not restored.  It kept building up to that, and then didn't happen.  Felt a little manipulated there.  I thought the ending was tied up nicely though.  It's actually what I hoped would happen when I was reading the 2nd book.  I wish there was a little more time spent on the ending and a little less on all the fighting.  This is probably the most violent of all three books.  I only started reading these b/c my 12 year old loves them and talked me into it.  The Maze Runner  i think is the strongest and the best written of the three.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|It is a fun game, but the comic story is not very clear in its story line. When you get to the Mexico portion, the tiles look very similar and are hard to match.

159102594X|1.0|as a long time fan of fantasy I looked forward to reading this book.  however, I could not finish it, because I found the characters too unsympathetic.  I absolutely hated glotka, and when I cheated and looked into the third book of the trilogy, and saw that he did not get the death that he deserved I saw no point in reading the rest of the first book (I only made it through the first 300 pages before I gave up on it).  maybe I am old fashioned, but I like my protagonists to be likable and sympathetic.  I also demand that a series have a happy ending or the books go in the dumpster.  I see no reason to finish this trilogy.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|This is a weird one, no doubt about it.  But that is precisely why it succeeds.  There's no computer graphics and sometimes it makes no sense, but it's hard to argue against the old fashioned entertainment Dracula provides.  Brahm Stoker's Dracula was the last great film from Francis Ford Coppola.  With Twilight vampires all the craze these days, I am glad there is a very expertly crafted counterpoint to that type of schlock.  That's not to say John Carpenter's Vampires or Blade should be ignored for their entertainment value, but Coppola went for high minded theater here and for the most part, it works.  The film is anchored multifold and a technical marvel.  Coppola's tone is joyously dark in the Polanski flavor.  Wojciech Kilar's music will live forever.  The performances are almost all perfect.  While Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves are forgettable, Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins are expectedly brilliant.  Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus' vibrant colors and deep black exposures give life to the daring production and costume design.  While the original novel is pretty much a snoozer in my opinion, and the movie doesn't exactly move at the quickest clip, there's rivers of blood lifted from Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and plenty of scantily clad beauties like Umbrian stunner Monica Belucci to keep you awake in this one.  To sum it up, the film walks the walk and talks the talk.  The bizzaro visuals give this telling of Dracula a unique character that breathes life into a humdrum hokum story.  It's just unfortunate Coppola hasn't bothered to do anything better since.  Just don't take it too seriously and this very well may live to be a masterpiece.

B0059XTUMC|5.0|It's not often that I go to see a movie twice, but here is a brave, unusual movie that takes huge risks with the audience, and explores the dominant theme of this years Oscars, nostalgia for the old Hollywood, and movies about movies.  Woody Allens Midnight in Paris cleverly explores the idea that we always yearn to live that golden period when all our heroes were alive, and introduces real characters from that period. Hugo, explores the world of a genius of the silent screen, with parallels between life and art in the movie.  My week with Marilym, unfortunately not nominated for Best Picture, receiving two acting nominations, explores a movie within a movie with two actors delivering amazing performances. The Descendants starring George Clooney, set in Hawaii explores the past in a most charming way in terms of now to show how to be responsible for the legacy of the past while dealing with a major family drama.  The Artist explores the idea of love, stardom, and hubris set in the silent screen era of the 1920s, and received 10 nominations including all the biggies, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Music.  Jean Dujardin looking like a young Sean Connery, plays an aging silent screen star. As the movie begins he plays a character within a movie that refuses to talk. Soon life will mirror art. Sometimes it's difrficult to tell then apart.  He accidentally bumps into an adorable young woman, Peppy Miller, who hopes to hit the big time. Soon they will accidentally meet again. I loved the impromptu dance sequence. They work together in a movie. I loved the mutiple take dance sequence. The attraction is undeniable. He gives her a beauty spot, and advice, advice which she follows to his detriment.  As the times change from silent to talk, George suffers. Soon his star falls as Peppy rises to fame and, the old guard gives way to a new generation, and pride can become an obstruction to love. It makes you wonder if these two star crossed lovers will ever work it out, and find an opportunity to love each other regardless of personal circumstance.  The Artist is a silent conversation about love, and who needs extensive conversation when you have two such photogenic and charismatic actors who can move us with with the crinkle of an eyebrow, or a few dance steps, whether that eyebrow expresses consternation, woe, and even occasionally joy.  Undoubtedly The Artist is the most adorable movie of the year, and it did take a huge risk in daring to be a silent movie in a talking world. Happily, it is of such a high quality that is has been nominated for everything. It's main competition appears to be The Descendants. Both Clooney and Dujardin are charming and charismatic.  Argentinina actress Berenice Bejo who plays Peppy has two children with the Director Michel Hazanavicius. All three have have previously worked together in the movie, [[ASIN:B001APM44O OSS 117: Cairo, Nest Of Spies]] a James Bond spoof in French with subtitles, which shows Dujardin's comic genius. If you have loved the Artist which I think you will, I highly recommend you check it out, because it's really good.  I think you will enjoy it, and I hopoe this review was helpful.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|These books are fantastic! I haven't been able to see the new movie yet, but I am very excited about it!  I don't want to give any spoilers, but I think that anyone can enjoy this series, no matter what genres you prefer reading.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It runs easy on the kindle fire, its a fun game. I just wish it had a more of a variety of solitaire games, instead of just this one game. But you dont need wifi so that's a plus!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This was one of the first apps that I got for my Kindle Fire when I purchased the device.  At first, I only used it to make out grocery lists (the check off feature is excellent for this) but then I started using the list making feature to make out homework to do lists for school.  Later, I discovered how well the calendar feature works and I have been using that to keep track of appointments, work, etc...  The only downside of this app is I have been unable to email notes to my gmail address.  I hope that they fix this soon, but it is still very useful without this.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|this is a good app I love how you can change the Color of the light fun to play with it
B004JK61K0|4.0|I have struggled since getting my Kindle Fire in January to find a good email app.  (I was not impressed with the one that came on the Fire.)  As a college student, email is paramount to me in school, which leads me to my first problem with K-9 mail.  It won't work with either of my schools' emails.  I don't know if it is a server problem or something else, but I think that this problem should be fixed.  (However, I have yet to find another app for the Kindle Fire that will work my either of my schools' email accounts.)<br />However, for my personal account that is with gmail, it works wonderfully.  This is by far the best email app that I have found for the Kindle Fire.  I recommend it to anybody who is looking for that great email experience with Android.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app! wonderful resource for when you're on the go and still want to dig into Gods gracious and merciful Word!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Not bad...some games are tougher than others but there is plenty to kill time.  I am still unlocking stuff.  Works fine on Fire.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|easy to use and fun. I like the variety in the levels. the zoom feature is great. no problems with it so far.
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|I was expecting a 3D trip down the Grand Canyon.  Considering the tirle \\"...River at risk\\" I expected a bit of preaching, but this is non-stop. If we're not destroying all rivers, it's the rocks, if it's not that it's the ozone, if it's not that it's...... endless whining.  There's more footage of the people whining about the river than there is of the canyon.  Even then the speech is hard to distinguish over the background sound while the 3D effect is good in places it is mostly quite ordinary.  If you want to feel like YOU are wholly and personally responsible for the entire planet buy this title, if you want to see the Grand Canyon, give it a wide bearth.  Very disappointing.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Kelly has improved a lot. this is no doubt her best album. her voice is beautiful, and all the songs have a nice melody to them. Einstein is my personal favorite, but all them are really amazing. it was worth the wait for this album. 5/5 stars!
B005DZMP00|4.0|I actually prefer disc 1. The warm up songs are all incredible. The highlight, strangely enough, is \\"Greatest Story Ever Told\\"... I find it boring through the 80's, but this was played at an incredible break-neck speed. Jerry's fills are soaring, and his solo steals the last part of the song. But the really great part is Bob.  Bobby's playing is so full of life, and his vocals are great. Also, great version of Bertha, and my first time hearing Pig Pen's China Town Shuffle which is great.  And, let's not kid ourselves: some of the best Dead is when Keith is on. Keith was ON in Europe.
B005G0ETV0|5.0|I must agree with the positives and annoyances cited by the earlier reviewers.  I have been entering the discs into iTunes and have just reached Disc 111 which the reviewers say is CD 111 BEETHOVEN - PIANO CONCERTO NO. 2 ~ RUBINSTEIN * BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA * LEINSDORF *.  In my set the sleeve it is in states that it is a Red Seal recording of \\"The Five Beethoven Piano Concertos.\\"  Indeed it only contains #2
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous is an amazing film that supports family values.  As a teacher for 40 years, I can't say enough about the need for men to step up and be the fathers they need to be.  This film shows that at its best.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was cautious after reading the previous reviews, but am very pleased with the cover.  Barely larger than the Fire itself. Keeps scratches off the screen. Nice rubberized plastic is showing a few scars from being bounced around in my backpack, but they are superficial and better it than the Fire.  I have no problem having it kept in landscape mode, as long as it is on a flat surface.  No regrets.
B005UBNKWO|3.0|I bought this CPU as an upgrade to my PC as I also needed to upgrade the Motherboard. Now AMD has been pushing this Bulldozer style platform for awhile now and to give the quick rundown of what it is. Basically AMD is trying to join the Hyper-threading Market, a system used by Intel's i3, i5 and i7 CPUs. Basically what hyper-threading does is \\"trick\\" the computer into thinking it has more threads to perform its duty. So if you have a dual-core you will see 4 threads and if you have a quad-core you will see 8 threads. Now AMD has released these CPU's in 3 flavors the 4-core, 6-core (which this is and I bought)and the 8-core. Now if you just look at the marketing description you may think \\"Wow! these are really inexpensive for 4,6,8 core CPUs, but the reality is these are actually dual-core, tri-core and quad-core CPU's with hardware and software programming which make them appear as though they have double the actual cores. So the marketing for these chips was better than the actual chips themselves. Now who would I recommend these CPU's too? Anybody who is looking for a pretty cheap upgrade to new hardware, who is coming from old hardware. I was coming from a 890GXB MOBO (not bad), HD6850 (kept it in the upgrade process) and a AMD phenom X2 B55 (unlocked to a X4, through Mobo bios). The only reason I upgraded both the Motherboard and CPU is because I need some extra PCI-e slots and the 890GXB was a micro-ATX which only had 1. So in the process I thought it would be better to upgrade the Motherboard to something newer and look for a slight upgrade to my CPU. The AMD 6100 fits that bill. It performs way better than what I had, as now my system does not seem to choke as much when rendering a video and even playing a game at the same time. Where before, my system would bog down while only rendering the video. So coming from what I came from I am happy. But if you have an Intel i3 2100, i5 2500k or i7 2600k you are better off just staying with what you have. Or if you have a top-end Phenom X4(such as the 965) or Phenom x6 from 1055t to 1090t, which are actually AMD's CPU's with 6 physical cores, you are better off with what you have. This AMD 6100 performs slightly better than the 1055t and struggles against anything that I have listed except for the CPU it replaced (Phenom x2 B55) and the Intel i3 2100. If you need a new build and have the money I recommend the Intel i5 2500k or the i7 2600k. But if you need something that will give a little more power and will not break the bank in the process looking at these AMD bulldozer CPU's is not a bad place to start.
0439023513|5.0|The book Mockingjay is a very amazing book!  The characters in this story are the most well-developed characters that I could possibly imagine.  If the main characters in this book had died, I would have probably thrown down the book.  I felt that I knew so much about Katniss, that I could be her.  She was a very well-developed character, with lots of detail included.  The book was very much worth reading, once you start reading you can't put it down.  The author kept my most of my attention throughout the book, sometimes the book would move a little slow, and then it would just pick right back up.  I was never really bored in this novel.  She puts in major detail about all the characters, and about what is going on at that point in time.  The book had a fantastic ending!  I don't think it needed any improvement at all.  Peeta and Katniss finally end together, which was an extraordinary thing, also Snow and Coin both died. Even though Prim died I thought she used it very well and didn't make too much of it.  Katniss uses this memorable quote \\"Peeta.  Blood like raindrops on the window.  Like wet mud on boots.\\" (143 Collins)  Prim was probably the saddest part of the book, I mean it was pretty much all because of Prim, Katniss never had to volunteer for her.  Then the adventure began, and it ends with Mockingjay.  I suggest this book to anyone and everyone, it is a fabulous book.
0439023483|4.0|This was a surprising choice for our book club, as it is a young adult book. Nevertheless, we take turns, and I wasn't sorry to have read it. The story is very engaging, Collins weaves a credible fantasy. If anything, I felt it a bit lacking in detail--not enough description of places and events to really establish a clear picture of what's going on. I also found the love scenes a bit tedious at times and drawn out. But it is a quick and interesting read, and it kept me turning the pages. Worthwhile.
B00004XQ83|5.0|QUICK AND EASY ORDERING AND RECEIVING PRODUCT.EASY TO LOCATE THIS ITEM ON LINE, WILL ORDER AGAIN AND WOULD RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND.

B006BDHAX0|1.0|At first the game was awesome until it started shutting off in the middle of a game. There were times I couldn't get the game to load. It was very frustrating!  After a couple of weeks I did get the game back, but with only 2 options instead of the 6 I had paid for. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
B004W1GCVE|4.0|I admit I was not familiar with the original Upstairs, Downstairs show from the 1970s until very recently. Thanks to Amazon Prime membership, I'm able to watch the episodes of the original show for free, and am still working my way through Season One. I love the interesting plot lines, the great cast, and the quality of writing. However, the production values are predictably dated and the film quality leaves much to be desired with the effect of looking washed out with dull colors. I hope they will restore the show one of these days and come up with a better quality DVD, with crisp and clear images and sound.<br /><br />When I saw that there was a remake of Upstairs, Downstairs, I was excited especially since I was feeling withdrawal symptoms with the end of Season 2 of Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 2 (Original U.K. Unedited Edition), one of my favorite British period dramas. One of the drawbacks of this remake is the fact that Season One only has three episodes! Initially, I thought this must be due to unfavorable audience response, and that the show was not renewed, but to my delight, it has been renewed for another season with six episodes. I still feel it is not enough, but I'll take what I can get!<br /><br />The setting for this remake of Upstairs, Downstairs is 1936, about six years after the year in which the original series had ended (in film). 165 Eaton Place is literally resurrected, not by a member of the Bellamy clan (the original family that resided there) but by the Holland's, made up of Sir Hallam (Ed Stoppard) who works for the Foreign Office, and his wife, Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes). They are soon joined by Hallam's eccentric mother, Maud (Eileen Atkins) and Agnes' spoilt younger sister Lady Persie (Claire Foy). Maud pushes her way into the household, bringing along her secretary/manservant Amanjit (Art Malik with a ghastly beard) and her little pet monkey Samson.<br /><br />The staff downstairs are made up of housekeeper, Mrs. Rose Buck (Jean Marsh - yes, from the original Upstairs, Downstairs, where she played a parlour maid); butler Mr. Warrick Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough); chauffeur Spargo (Neil Jackson); cook Mrs. Thackeray (Anne Reid, formerly of Coronation Street - Golden Anniversary Collection [DVD](REGION 2, UK VERSION); and a housemaid, Ivy (Ellie Kendrick, who played Anne Frank in Masterpiece Theatre: The Diary of Anne Frank.

030788743X|5.0|Let me cut to the chase and ask a few pointed questions:<br /><br />1. Were you raised in the 80's and/or love 80's geek culture?<br /><br />2. Are any of the following movies among your favorites: Monty Python and the Holy Grail, War Games, Blade Runner, Ladyhwake?<br /><br />3. Do you love video games, tabletop RPG games, D&D, or MMO's?<br /><br />4. Is your iPod filled with Rush and ACDC?<br /><br />If you answered \\"YES\\" to any of those questions, stop reading this review RIGHT NOW and buy this book.  I'll wait until you finish reading it before continuing my review.<br /><br />...<br /><br />...<br /><br />This book has totally blown my mind. I spent an entire weekend reading it. I read it while eating; I read it while waiting for downloads or airplanes; I read it before bed. I couldn't get enough of this book. It has become one of my Top 10 Favorites of All Time.<br /><br />What about this book has made the slowest reader into a speed reader? What about this book stopped me from wasting time surfing the Internet for Memes I've missed? What has captivated me so much that I want to go to the nearest mountain and scream, \\"I HAVE READ THE MOST AWESOMEST BOOK EVER AND YOU NEED TO READ IT TOO\\"?<br /><br />This book has so much going for it. Great world-building. Well-developed, realistic characters. A nerdy, geeky sub-culture. Science-fiction. A post-apocalyptic world. A well-done romance. NO ROMANTIC TRIANGLES. A love for the 80's. A deeper look at how the Internet affects us now, and the differences between reality and virtuality.<br /><br />Cline obviously loves the 80's. This entire book is a tribute to that totally tubular era. We have the obvious mentions of popular culture--the music, movies, and video games of the era. But I see the whole book as a tribute to an 80's movie. The young man living in destitution dreaming of hope while living his existence in a virtual reality. Where he meets the woman he's always wanted. Supported by his gnarly friend. And through the strength and wit of his own mind, he is able to solve the puzzles and forge ahead. After a few montages (the romance montage, the \\"training\\" montage) and a setback in Act 2, our hero determines to press on--but his goals are no longer the \\"Fame and Fortune\\" of his youth. He's there to fight against the faceless enemy (lead by the evil villain out for profit and to destroy people's freedoms in the name of business). He's fighting to prove his love to the girl of his dreams. He's there to bring hope to the destitute.<br /><br />Quintessential 80's movie? For sure!<br /><br />Our characters are lovingly created, from our protagonist Wade/Parzival, to his love, Art3mis, to his best bud, Aech (think \\"H\\"). Wade is everyman; he is a normal student, trying to get by while living in the slums of Nowhere, Oklahoma with his aunt. He's an average guy, with an above-average obsession with everything 80's and specifically the likes of his role model, James Hallidy, video game designer of the most popular game, OASIS. Wade reminds me of myself and others I know. He's obsessed with video games, 80's nostalgia, and geeky films. He retreats into them instead of facing life, and yet instead of enjoying this freedom, he wants more.<br /><br />Art3mis did scare me a bit; Love Interests can often be shallow, excuses for a hot babe and a good roll in the sack. But Art3mis isn't that girl. She is like me as well. She is a nerd girl amongst guys. She is strong-willed, independent, free-thinking, and determined. She doesn't need a man to save her; she works fine on her own, thank-you-very-much. But she definitely does have chemistry with Wade, and she admires/loves him. Seeing them grow together was a breath of fresh air; no \\"insta-loves\\" or \\"stalker loves\\" here!<br /><br />And lastly, we have Aech. Aech is quite the mysterious figure (when you find out his identity, I'm sure you'll be a bit shocked, I know I was--not to mention who he turns out to be says a little bit about the supposed \\"freedoms\\" in this utopic OASIS), but he works well with Wade. They somehow are able to be the best of friends even though they are both competing for the same prize. And even when their relationship hits a few bumps, you don't have long drawn out Big Misunderstandings between the two.<br /><br />I do have a few character complaints, but they are really minor. Shoto and Daito are said to be Japanese and they talk a lot of \\"honor\\". Not saying there is anything bad about this, but it feels a bit stereotypical. There aren't many females in this book--Art3mis is really the only major female character. However, this may have been done on purpose (all the jokes about how rare gamer/geek girls are and such). There is a character that appears at the end to save the day, in a somewhat Deus Ex Machina fashion. I'm not too perturbed at what he does--the book is somewhat fashioned after an 80's movie--but I wish that we had more time with him, understanding him.<br /><br />Cline was a master at the world-building. There are a lot of apocalyptic/dystopian fiction out there right now, and most of it suffers because of poor world-building and not a deep enough understanding of how the world works (oh, yeah, and this thing called \\"Let's make a romance and toss in some bits to make it about a dystopia, because EVERYONE loves romances and dystopias are popular right now\\"). This is not true with \\"Ready Player One\\". I felt Cline did a superb job advancing us 30 years into the future (though some of the devices he talks about feel a little too advanced, but those occur later in the book). I felt as if I were being plugged into the OASIS, being transported alongside Wade, Art3mis, and Aech. From Wade's home in Oklahoma to the remote depths of OASIS, the world was real to me. I loved the attention to detail Cline included--giving the background of Halliday, the energy crisis, the deteriorating living conditions, etc.<br /><br />The writing is addictive. Once I started reading, I really couldn't stop. It had a great flow to it, was clear and clean, and really matched well with Wade's personality. I certainly didn't expect to read this book as fast as I did; I am a VERY slow reader and getting through an almost 400 page book in a weekend is a rarity for me!<br /><br />I've hinted at the story, comparing it to classic 80's movie plotlines, but it genuinely is unique and interesting. I love journey/adventure stories. I love stories where a character uses his or her own mind to solve puzzles and to race against time/someone else. And \\"Ready Player One\\" has that in abundance. Wade has to find a key, but he has numerous obstacles in his way. Money. Resources. The Threat of the Sixers. Love. His struggle to find meaning and hope in a world that isn't worth living in. It's a deep, compelling story, one that resonates with me.<br /><br />Towards the middle of the book, the story does slow and threaten to come to a halt. This is around the time of the romance/training montage. I get WHY these scenes were necessary (what good 80's movie would NOT have a montage???), but there was more than once that I almost put aside the book and left it there. Fortunately, these sections don't last long, and once again, we are thrown back into the race for the keys.<br /><br />I loved this book. It was a totally awesome book. I loved almost everything: from the characters to the story to the world-building to the 80's geek out to the prose. But what really sticks out is the message. It's a message that is becoming more and more real to me: what is reality and do we want to bother with it? If there is a paradise, a world where you can be whatever you want, an \\"OASIS\\" from life, should we run away from the hardships of reality and sequester ourselves into this otherworld? How are real friendships affected by the distance that we place people, the anonymity we shroud ourselves in when we adopt these artificial constructs and run around in this virtual world? Can real friendships be made with those we've never met in person? And how will this affect us in the future?<br /><br />I don't have all the answers, but I know one thing: as much as I love surfing for more YouTube videos of cats, I would much rather spend time with my family and friends (friends I've met both in the real world and the virtual world), than in the grips of a virtual paradise. And I think Cline, uber geek that he is, feels the same way.<br /><br />So, yeah, go out, buy this book now. You won't regret it.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

There's also a young footman who appears, goes away, and returns during the first season.  The main events in this first season revolve around Lady Agnes trying to take charge of her household, and coming up against her formidable mother-in-law who uses her vast experience as a weapon to override her daughter-in-law's wishes. Not that Lady Agnes tries too hard, given a new development that preoccupies her. Meanwhile, a new maid is brought into the fold, and it turns out she is a Jewess who has escaped from Germany. She appears sickly and harbors a secret that is revealed soon enough.  Lady Persie is portrayed as the self-centered, lost soul-type whose reckless nature causes her to not only throw convention to the wind, but also strike up a most inappropriate alliance.

B004EI2NM2|5.0|This movie about two young women, who share a passionate relationship, over the course of an evening, is a well made movie. It doesn't hurt that they are attractive, considering they spend much of the time sans clothes, and often, in passionate embraces. Although some of the scenes are dark (it perhaps was the settings on my set), there are sequences where they are clearly visible enough to tell they are physically beautiful. Both Ms. Anaya and Ms. Yarovenko exhibit their passion for each other beautifully. It is surprising their accented English is easy to understand, considering it's probably not their first language. Although the dialogue (such as it is) is often subtitled, most viewers won't be focusing on it (ahem),but overall, it's a nice film.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|My bias...<br /><br />Loves: Exceeded expectations<br />Likes: James Franco<br />Dislikes: CGI<br />Hates: Planet of the Apes by Tim Burton<br /><br />I'll preface my review by saying that I have not seen any of the older Apes movies, but have seen the Tim Burton movie (which I cannot remember a thing from, but I do remember that I hated it). That being said, I missed this in theaters because I had no attachments to the Apes franchise and the first trailer released looked awful.<br /><br />I wish that I had caught this on the big screen. I loved every minute of this movie. The story was strong enough that I was able to ignore the (at times) poor CGI and got attached to Caesar as a non-human protaginist. The only problem I had with this film was the fact tnat,  during the start of the film,around 8 years supposedly passes and no one ages or becomes any different in their motivations, personality, or hairstyles.<br /><br />The human acting is servicable and the action, while used sparingly, is done well. The setup of the final battle scene is excellent.<br /><br />All in all, I loved this movie. It didn't do much with the humans, but I was instantly attached to Caesar. I welcome our new primate overlords with open arms.<br /><br />Score: A

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not only are they the best self-published books, they are better then most of the print books I've read in recent years.  I've been a voracious reader my entire life, and I'm into my fifth decade now. Science fiction was my first literary love. As it has become more popular over the years, it has sometimes been more difficult to find those true gems of the genre. You, my friend, need look no further then the \\"Wool Omnibus Edition\\".  There is one science fiction classic that I feel these books are very evocative of: Robert A. Heinlein's \\"Orphans of the Sky\\". They are completely different works, but the protagonist's yearning for knowledge and truth resonate in very similar ways. There are some similarities, but those are merely the bones on which this story is hung. These are very engaging reads, and you really empathize with the characters. For that reason alone I recommend buying the Omnibus Edition as opposed to buying the books individually - I won't say more for fear of giving away too much of the plot.  The editing of this book was superb. I didn't notice a single editing gaffe; something which is usually very problematic in self-published books.  I plan on reading more of Hugh Howey's works very soon. I hope you do as well.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|Some say it blows, but this film blew me away. A fantastic cast with balanced performances by all, excellent cinematography and shot composition, music that is unbelievably unique and infectious, a story that manages to be engaging and non-stereotypical despite its simplicity... A classic tale of a mysterious (anti-)hero finding his purpose, but told in a manner that is compelling and atypical and rarely seen nowadays. There are qualities that harken back to some of the action classics of the late 70s and early 80s, but it definitely stands on its own merits. I could watch this film over and over again, and seeing/listening to it all on Blu-Ray makes a big impact. For me, it's an instant classic.

0062060562|4.0|Book Description<br /><br />Here is the description from Amazon that hooked me:<br /><br />Every day Christine wakes up not knowing where she is. Her memories disappear every time she falls asleep. Her husband, Ben, is a stranger to her, and he's obligated to explain their life together on a daily basis--all the result of a mysterious accident that made Christine an amnesic. With the encouragement of her doctor, Christine starts a journal to help jog her memory every day. One morning, she opens it and sees that she's written three unexpected and terrifying words: \\"Don't trust Ben.\\" Suddenly everything her husband has told her falls under suspicion. What kind of accident caused her condition? Who can she trust? Why is Ben lying to her? And, for the reader: Can Christine's story be trusted?<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />The description immediately reminded me of the excellent movie Memento, which was a mind-bending thriller about a man with amnesia who cannot make new memories but is trying to solve the murder of his wife with a series of notes, tattoos and photos that he uses as clues. I adored Memento (even though it gave me a big fat headache trying to follow it), and Before I Go To Sleep sounded similar. I'm glad to report that the book mostly lived up to my expectations. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I had to know what was really going on. Although the ending didn't quite live up to what I was hoping for (but how often do they?), the ride was totally worth it.<br /><br />The book is told from Christine's point of view so we get information about her situation at the same time Christine does, which I thought was an effective way to write the book. Watson keeps up the pace throughout and does a good job of keeping you in suspense--making for a fast and exciting read.<br /><br />However, the ending had some issues that might leave some readers feeling disgruntled and underwhelmed. I can't help but think if Watson had just added one more sentence at the very end, it would have made for a brilliant ending. (If you're curious about the sentence, let me know in the comments and I'll e-mail it to you.)  Still, it was a better than average thriller that got my blood pumping and kept me reading later than I should have. I also have to give Watson props as this is his debut novel, and I think he picked a difficult premise to pull off. I suspect that if you think about the specifics too much, the whole thing might fall apart so don't think too much while reading. Just go with the flow and you'll find yourself whipping through this book in no time.<br /><br />Recommended For<br /><br />Fans of mysteries and thrillers that offer psychological suspense up the wazoo.u're curious about the sentence, let me know in the comments and I'll e-mail it to you.)

B006LEHOL2|3.0|This was her easily her most coherent, focused set in over a decade, and all things considered, the album is as good as her first two classics, 2000's criminally underrated 'Faith and Courage', and 1997's superb little 'Gospel Oak' EP. That's 6 very, very good studio albums (which I defy the vast majority of major artists to proffer 6 basically splendid albums). Her other 5 studio albums, not counting the She Who Dwells B-side offering, were mostly plonk (in my opinion). But this record is up there with her best as far as the overall quality of songs, wise production (John Reynolds) and arrangements. Beautiful record.<br /><br />Sadly, 2 points subtracted because no amount of studio wizardry in the world can hide Sinead's shamefully cigarette-damaged voice at this point, and it IS dismaying and does detract from the impact of the tunes. Tunes like &#34;4th & Vine&#34; &#34;Old Lady&#34; &#34;Wolf is Getting Married&#34; &#34;Back Where You Belong&#34; and &#34;Home&#34; rank with the best stuff she has EVER written.<br /><br />1/2 point subtracted for a truly hysterical album title, which has nothing to do with the prevailing tone of the record, and which was a last-minute petulant, reactionary bit of nonsense to respond to some tabloid foolishness she was involved with at the time, far removed from the music.<br /><br />1/2 point deducted for a few really ghastly lyrics (&#34;bunnies&#34; in the screaming Vatican song) and the entirety of VIP, one of the most godawful rambling bits of crap ever known. It may be valid to call Bono and Geldoff to account for certain things, but you'd better bloody well write brilliantly if you're going to do it. Otherwise, this is a solid 4 star album.

B006CC0YB0|3.0|Despite Mark Lanegan being my favourite vocalist of the last twenty years, when I first heard Blues Funeral I was initially very disappointed. Deliberately, I didn't rush to become one of the first to review it here in case I gave the album an unfair critique. Aside from 'Gravedigger Song' and perhaps 'Riot in my House' there didn't seem to be any other standout tracks on the album, so I've spent the last few weeks re-listening to it in the hope that Blues Funeral might grow on me. On every listen, I've desperately waited for it to reveal some hidden musical depths that I may have overlooked at first, but sadly, to no avail.<br /><br />I have been a Mark Lanegan fan ever since Screaming Trees released their classic 'Sweet Oblivion' in 1992, and I have followed his career closely since. In all, Mark Lanegan has produced some amazing tunes over his well-established career, though to be honest, there have been a fair amount of disposable tracks in his otherwise remarkable solo output. I agree with another reviewer here that 2004's 'Bubblegum' is perhaps his crowning achievement, so it is not that I am in any way stuck in the past. I just don't think Blues Funeral is particularly inspired, or to put it bluntly, it simply isn't that good.<br /><br />I think Lanegan's lyrics here come across more disingenuous than past offerings, as if he is trying too hard to be dark and moody, which detracts from the realism and (seemingly genuine) despair that has permeated his previous albums. It is as if he finally sees himself as a marketable commodity, and that the 'gloom' Lanegan pedals is what makes his product profitable. This may seem harsh but it leaves me with that impression, and the bland, unimaginative or outright cheesy musical scores that accompany many of the tracks on Blues Funeral do little to bolster what, to me at least, is an album that both tried too hard and didn't try hard enough... and failed. Most of it just blends into the background with the wallpaper, as ifit isn't there at all. A far cry from 'Bubblegum' then, where every track cried out to be heard.<br /><br />To the uninitiated, it's definitely worth checking out most of Mark Lanegan's earlier solo work, plus the later 'Screaming Trees' albums and his fabulous collaborations with Greg Dulli as the 'Gutter Twins' (Isobel Campbell's voice is an acquired taste, but there's some great material there, too)
B004T4KQJS|1.0|One star purely for dumbing down the English language and for ignoring logic by the lying title of this book.<br /><br />Neil deGrasse Tyson says, \\"Nothing is not nothing. Nothing is something\\", showing, once again, that ability with math, pure or applied, doesn't necessarily give you ability with spoken and written language, still less with clear thinking. This is especially true when there's an ideological axe to grind; in this case, it's basically theism versus atheism.<br /><br />The result is a bit of nonsense: nothing is almost nothing but not quite. If something can be given names that denote its properties then by definition it's not nothing.<br /><br />Cosmologists are not permitted to recast common usage; their \\"nothing\\" is truly a dumbing-down of the conventional meaning of \\"nothing\\". Contemplating the true meaning of nothing is a crucial discipline. But the cosmologists spewing out these popularizing books can't seem to handle it. Or at least, they want the sales numbers, courtesy of the pseudo-intellectual book-buyer.<br /><br />If something is \\"close to nothing\\", it's something. Period.

B005C7SXMS|3.0|I watched this film twice--the second time to see whether I had missed anything big. I don't think I did. This is a hip and quirky coming-of-age story that is so intent on being quirky that it ends up not being very real. Fifteen-year-old Oliver Tate is a fairly typical outsider at school and is trying to land a girlfriend whose mother may be dying while he simultaneously saves his parents' marriage, which is endangered by his mother's apparent infatuation with a self-help guru.  All of this could be the standard plot, give or take a bit, for any number of films, but \\"Submarine\\" is indeed different. For example, this fifteen-year-old boy listens to French crooners. He also makes films, at least in his dreams. In fact, he does a great number of things that, individually, might be credible of any particular fifteen-year-old boy but which, collectively, took the story out of the realm of believability for me. I still enjoyed the film, but I couldn't really get over the fact that I really did not believe in the characters. Nearly all of them seemed to be--I don't know what the right word is here. They're not stereotypes, certainly, or clichés. They're not archetypes. They just seem to be odd for the sake of being odd. And oddness does lead to some funny moments, but this is a film that just didn't work well for me.  I'm sure there will be others who love this, and I certainly would like to see more from writer/director Ayoade, who I think shows great potential. But \\"Submarine\\" was a mildly amusing diversion for me, little more.

B006ISJQ1W|3.0|Based on a novel by Hunter S. Thompson of the same name which focuses upon a wandering writer wanna be who takes a job for a rag of a newspaper in Puerto Rico during the 1960s. While there are some notable and interesting themes in this tale about getting too old to do your art and lust coming out after you're drunk beyond belief the flow of this tale was incredibly slow. Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Eckhart star. This is probably best suited for people who enjoyed the novel or who were looking for a tale about writers or who want a high brow picture. Note that HST was known for maniacal characters and in his spare time liked to take all types of drugs. He also hated Nixon with a passion and is credited with Gonzo journalism. It is definitely an homage to the author who died in 2005.

0307949486|3.0|I have been waiting a long time to read this book. Unfortunately I expected to be able to just pick it up and read it fairly quickly. This was however, not what happened. I hit a very hard brick wall upon opening it and starting to read. It was a horrendous fight to read this book all the way through. The author was so detailed in his descriptions to set the scene and get the story under way that I and the ladies who were reading it along with me really had to fight hard to not give up on reading this book in its entirety. The detailed content in the first 200 pages give or take were the hardest to swallow. Once the story picked up at the point where Mikael is working for Vagner and really into into the police reports and interviewing the family, then it was a bit easier and more fluid to read through.<br /><br />The first half though caused me to have to take numerous breaks from reading the book because the tedious and boring sort of writing style it was extremely difficult to swallow and read at any sort of a pace. Coming from someone who reads very quickly, this book took several days longer than it should have for it's size and topic.<br /><br />That being said the story was very good, despite it's writing style and descriptive over kill problems. I do endeavour to read the other two books in the series. Unfortunately they are also written in this exhaustive and boring manner until the story pick up and zooms along in the later half of the books. I plan on approaching them with more time to read them in so I can take my time and take breaks and not feel rushed and forced to buckle down so hard to push through it. I recommend having other books on the go so you can interchange between them to help you be able to read them and not feel buried under mountains of verbal diarrhoea.<br /><br />I am happy to finally be done this book, but I am happy that I read it as it's a great story.<br /><br />For these reasons I score the book 3/5. The movie was great, but having read the book now, they missed out on SO much it's actually quite disappointing upon reflection. That being said I do still like the movie, while not as much as I did before knowing the complete story. Which I expect to be the case with the other two movies of the Swedish renditions.<br /><br />PriscillaO much it's actually quite disappointing upon reflection.

B000BVQ9JO|5.0|My first Strokes album was Is This It. I listened to it sometime in 2007 after reading a bit about it. I was probably nine when it was first released, so I wasn't really a witness to all the hype that reportedly surrounded the band at that time, nor was I witness to the backlash. When I listened to it, I thought too many of the songs sounded the same, Casablancas sounded too detached and sarcastic, the lyrics were hard to understand and that the whole band was trying a bit too hard to be cool. The only song I really liked was the title track. It was slow and pretty, and Casablancas sounded absolutely sincere. He was tired, he was miserable, he was disappointed and he was sick of it all. It seemed like the only honest song on the album.<br /><br />So why do I mention all this? Well, the thing about First Impressions of Earth is that the whole album has that air of honesty that was only a small fraction of the first album. It's 14 songs of emotional exhaustion, bitterness and alienation. It's easy to see it as fallout from the stress the band undoubtedly endured after being heralded as the saviors of Rock. Looking at the album credits, Casablancas appears to be the main creative force at work here, which makes the album sound surprisingly personal. Not really something you'd expect from a Strokes record. He still sounds kind of sarcastic at times, but I think it lends itself to the lyrics pretty well, like in \\"Juicebox\\" where he screams \\"Why won't you come over here?! We've got a city to love!!!\\". Alone, that line sounds like part of a party song, but its delivery makes it sound more like part of an angry, drunken rant than anything.<br /><br />\\"Juicebox\\" and the other pissed off songs are offset by a large dose of melancholy. The music is still fairly loud, but the vocal melodies are generally sad and sweet. The chorus of \\"On the Other Side\\" has kind of a wistful, dark folk vibe to it while \\"Fear of Sleep\\" sounds like 5 AM following a long night of anxiety and boredom. Then there's the resigned \\"Ask Me Anything\\", which really sounds like an album closer even though it appears halfway through the proceedings. Musically, it's the albums starkest arrangement, comprised of little more than vocals and a mellotron, playing a simple but rhythmically eccentric chord progression. Combined with the lyrics (which are of course heartbreaking), it packs one of the harder emotional punches on the album.<br /><br />First Impressions of Earth's best track is \\"Heart in a Cage\\". It rocks hard, with furious lead guitar work and perfectly executed drumming. Meanwhile Casablancas delivers one of the most cathartic vocal takes I've ever heard, sounding both wounded and defiant while singing doom 'n' gloom lyrics that manage to hit home with almost every line. That song alone is probably worth the purchase.<br /><br />One last thing I'd like to mention is the CD booklet, in which every song gets its own two pages, complete with lyrics. prog-worthy artwork, and each song's title incorporated into said artwork. It gives you a lot to look at, which is something I always appreciate in CD packaging.

B006M4RN3U|2.0|I bought the first album when it was released and I'm still entertained by it. I was so excited for this album, when it was put up on the Internet to stream I was immediately there. I'll admit at first I was put off by the auto-tune in the track \\"Some Nights\\", but now it's my favorite song off the album. The album seemed really good, kept getting better in my opinion and then right when \\"Carry On\\" ended and \\"It Gets Better\\" came on, my smile sunk immediately into a frown and from there I was just disgusted with the rest of the album. I know people are going to complain and blah-blah-blah, but that song is literally the worst song, a band I like, has ever written and coincidentally ruined the entire album for me. I've tried re-listening 4 times now and I still can't anything out of the second half of the record.

This is dishonest and underhanded and I want the money back and I want a black mark on this companys history so no one else will have to deal with them
B006ON41FC|3.0|I enjoy playing this game but when I bought something for 8000 nuts it said that I had it but I realy didn't.other than that it a pretty good app.
B001JNNE64|5.0|The Director's cut packaging is a welcome decision. My only concern was if  any scenes were deleted but the added scenes in my opinion enrich the  movie experience (not the opposite as some of the reviewers have stated).  My only objection would be the few seconds of nudity (topless Stanzy) at  the cost of the \\"R\\" rating.  The Director's cut packaging also includes a CD (who would object to yet  another Mozart CD?) and a few pages of photos and interesting narratives.

B004QX07G4|4.0|This book is Ellen DeGeneres--or at least her public persona.  Scatterbrained and rapid fire silliness which somehow makes sense and imparts truth.  This wasn't a \\"can't put down\\" book for me.  In fact, I had to put it down to give my brain a rest.  Just like her stand-up acts, she jumps from one thought to another with such speed you almost get whiplashed trying to follow.  However, if you like Ellen (and who doesn't) you'll like this book.  Read a couple of chapters, have a laugh, put it down and rest your funny bone.  I read it while I'm on the treadmill--sure makes that much more fun.
0062011847|4.0|As one of the the most dedicated Pratchett fans, I was somewhat apprehensive about this book. Sir Terry's mind in the pre-Alzheimer's days inspired my awe and affection in boundless quantities (and I honestly don't feel that way about anybody else writing today). Soooo.... yes, this does seem like someone else's writing; or 90% of it does.It probably is indeed someone else's writing, and they're apparently aiming for the 13- year-old boy audience (I am middle aged female).  But that sets off the small good parts even more. Maybe the poignancy adds something, but I was laughing and crying at the same time, several times, amid all the dark and poo.

B005X5MXM0|5.0|Ian Hunter has always been one of my musical heroes and Mick Ronson, one of the original Spiders from Mars, was not only a fantastic guitarist but quite dishy. This DVD of a concert filmed in Germany is great. These two legends were meant to be together and Ronson's early death was a true rock tragedy. But now we have this DVD to remember this collaboration by. I know the same thing had previously been released on CD, but it's soooo good to have the visual as well. What a wonderful antidote to the &%@#!% that passes for music today.

B000002GWN|5.0|I have always loved this live Joni Mitchell album. There is just something about the performances that really appeals to me. A few of the songs are done quite differently from the studio versions. That doesn't mean they are better or worse, just different. But this is definitely my favorite version of Both Sides Now. And Tom Scott and his group are a wonderful complement to Joni. I know that some people have complained about a certain loss of atmosphere because some of the in between stuff that was on the vinyl was edited out for the CD. But the songs are still there and this is one album I will never tire of listening to.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Playing on Kindle Fire.  Ok, let's be honest...this is nothing more than a Solitaire game - a simple, fun, addicting PERFECT Solitaire game. I can't seem to stop playing. you can play random draws or choose to play games with leader boards.  Both 3-card draw and single draws. You can customize the cards and playing surface, including an option to use your own photos.  If you have to exit the app it'll restart where you left off.  As with any app there are some minor glitches - but none so terrible that they impact play.  I've been playing this game for well over 2 months and am still loving this perfect little game.  If you want a great card game to help pass time then you've got to get Solitaire by MobilityWare.

B000002UR7|5.0|I got this several years ago, and when I saw it on my recommendations I couldn't help but put my two cents in.  I grew up with a family who loves music, my first 'band love' was The Beatles, which my parents would play with their records.  My brother whose older than me, became very into music with many different bands, and so I too, loved those particular bands.  Once he had gone off to college and it was just me, I started actually looking for music to listen to on my own accord and then I stumbled upon Radiohead's Pablo Honey album and I was in love with them ever since.  I read somewhere that it was somewhat underrated when it first came out which baffles me since each song has a unique enough sound to be distinguishable, yet the album seems to flow without interruption.  I found this cd to be an excellent purchase.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|What can I say?  A GREAT ALBUM FROM A TALENTED MUSICIAN. Its a very dark album, released during the cold winter... perfect!  However its a shame that some translation of '50 Words For Snow' was made up... Still its a must have album to everyone who love music.
B003NJPOAQ|5.0|i read a few negative reviews on this album, so i was hesitant about buying it. but i figured it's jack johnson, it can't be bad! i was definitely right! i adore almost every song on the album, and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, 7 of them. it's my second favorite album of his behind sleep through the static. get it! you won't be disappointed. :)

B002SAUCBC|5.0|Again, this character driven novel was hard to put down. One of King's finest. And next to his Dark Towers series, one of my favorites. I emotionally felt every mile these boys walked - every bit of their pain, became so attached I experienced personal loss, even for the winner, by the end of the story.<br /><br />I read this many years ago and read it again years later, then just ordered it on kindle last month and read it again.

1416955070|2.0|The covers to these books have caught my eye every time I go into the book store. So I finally broke down and got one. It was a quick read and was entertaining but I found it frustrating too. The characters feel sort of flat despite some decent efforts here and there. Also, a lot of the book felt very familiar, a bit like a lot of my favorite stories remixed into one. Which doesn't bother me too much if the author takes it somewhere new or puts a spin on it. I didn't get that here.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Adam Green? Shawn Ashmore? Emma Bell? Are you familiar with any of these names? No, me neither. Yet, these three, with one other actor, created a celluloid project, a movie featuring three fascinating character studies. Oh, but they are not the stars--they're just passing through. The environment will become the controlling force.<br /><br />In Sartre's play, \\"No Exit,\\" three disparate characters torment each other. That's Sartre's Hell on Earth theory.<br /><br />The premise of \\"Frozen\\" is the questioning by the three character studies: Will we escape? Will we get out of here? Is this our hell on earth?<br /><br />You see, on Sunday morning, three people--two male friends, with one part of a couple--a threesome--go snow skiing for the day. The two men have been friends since first grade. (The undertone is that one is still in the closet about his homosexuality and his love for the other young man). The dilemma is the young woman, the steady girlfriend of the man in between. No one knows or suspects, except the audience, about the closet concept.<br /><br />Yet the inciting event happens when the three are determined to beg another ride up the ski lift for \\"one more\\" turn downhill. They never make it to the top. Through misunderstanding and mis-communication, the trio are left up in the air and in the dark when the lift attendant is dismissed for the evening. However, not just the evening but the week. Not just the week....<br /><br />There are three people in the lift where, normally, it is quiet and safe and almost cozy.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I got this book on a whim to read on the subway to and from work... then I found myself reading at lunch time, in bed, waiting in line.  So addictive!  And it mentions some of my favourite pop culture bits from my childhood.  Real Genius?  Really?  In my top 5 movies of all time.  Very well put together, nice relationships.  I enjoyed seeing the protagonist's character development in such a short time.  I'm strongly considering reading this again!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read some classic si-fy/fantasy and this does not compare in complexity to books like Lord of the Rings or Dune. That being said, the book is a teen book, so expectations shouldn't be set that high. The characters and their development is great and I was hooked after the first chapter. While young, the characters fight their way through a very dystopic world with very mature attitudes. I also love that the main character is a strong female, something that is often lacking in pop-culture. If I had teenage children I would definitely encourage them to read this.

For me this book has worked as a good reminder of what is important and how to prioritize my efforts. I still have a long way to go. I am not looking for possession-less lifestyle, I just want to enjoy what I do have more.
0812550757|5.0|It's been 3000 years since Ender Wiggin, as a child, was tricked into committing xenocide. While he and his sister Valentine traveled the universe and benefited from the effects of space-time relativity, Ender's name has been reviled on Earth and all the inhabited planets. He is infamous for his childhood deeds, but almost everyone thinks he's been dead for centuries. They don't realize that the man who holds the respected position of Speaker for the Dead is actually Ender Wiggin. And they don't know that the Hive Queen of the Buggers still lives and that Ender has vowed to find her a new home. When Ender is called to the planet Lusitania to speak the death of a beloved xenologer, he thinks he may have finally found a suitable place for the Hive Queen to resurrect her race.<br /><br />In the author's afterward to Speaker for the Dead, Orson Scott Card explains that this was the novel he had always intended to write and that Ender's Game, its more famous and popular prequel, was just an introduction. I'm sure that's why, as much as I loved Ender's Game as a thrilling action-packed YA adventure, I liked Speaker for the Dead even more. This is a more mature, thoughtful, and far-reaching story.<br /><br />Card explains that he wanted to explore this question: \\"What do we do about dead people whose lives were really crummy? What do we do about people who were vicious... What do you say at the funeral?\\" He suggests that we deal with this by lying, or by erasing the person they really were, re-making them, after their death, into the person we wish they had been. To address this human tendency, Card created the function of Speaker for the Dead -- an objective outsider who would learn about the person who had died and would then speak the truth about him. This would involve uncovering not only the person's good and bad deeds, but also the background that would let his acquaintances understand why he became the person he was. Card effectively uses the role of Speaker for the Dead to show us that there may be a very good reason why a \\"bad\\" person turns out that way. Not that this excuses his behavior, but it at least makes it understandable and may help us see how our own behaviors could have contributed to it. Perhaps then we can be more forgiving.<br /><br />There is way more going on in Speaker for the Dead than this, though. Card explores the sciences of cultural anthropology and genetics as researchers on Lusitania are learning about the native alien species that live there. In so doing, he manages to touch on ecology, biodiversity, virology, xenophobia, cultural elitism, our motivations for scientific study of other species, and how advancing technologies drastically change a culture. He asks us to consider when we should disobey our government and when we should abandon the ethical principles we've sworn to uphold. He asks us to constantly question all of our previous knowledge.<br /><br />Though this is a meaty and thought-provoking work, Speaker for the Dead is populated with characters you can love, hate, or otherwise relate to, and Card holds it all together with a heart-wrenching story about loneliness, bullying, abuse, hate, jealousy, adultery, incest, companionship, guilt, forgiveness, redemption, love, and death. There's a lot going on here.<br /><br />At the conclusion of Speaker for the Dead Ender finds that, once again, he has both destroyed and saved lives, and he is severely misunderstood by most of his fellow humans. He has accomplished much in Speaker for the Dead, but there is more trouble literally on the horizon. I can't wait to see how he deals with it in the third ENDER WIGGIN novel, Xenocide.<br /><br />Speaker for the Dead was published in 1986 and, like its prequel Ender's Game, it won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, making Orson Scott Card the first author to win both awards two years in a row. It also won the Locus Award. I listened to Audio Renaissance's full-cast audio production of Speaker for the Dead. It's excellent and highly recommended.

0307455351|4.0|I must say that this is indeed a blast of fresh air, as the Chicago Tribune said. I have read many thriller novels, but few have caught my attention as this one. The story is full of intriguing and unexpected turn of events. Mikael Blomkvist is a financial journalist that ends up investigating a family mystery for Henrik Vanger, an old businessman tortured by the disappearance of a very dear family member, Harriet Vanger. He moves to Hedestad for a year to do this assignment.<br /><br />As he gathers more puzzle pieces and approaches to the truth things start to get hectic. He hires Lisbeth Salander, the gitl with the dragon tattoo, to help him unravel the mystery. She is quite a character I must say, but I liked her a lot. How her mind works is quite fascinating. She has to deal with a nasty human being, her guardian Bjurman, but she deals with this creep in quite a unique way. I was really shocked to read about the statistics of violence against women in Sweden, and how elevated the woman hater's population is. One would think that in such a civilized country this wouldn't reach such proportions, but it does. I don't want to give away more details about the book lest I take away the surprise factor out of it. But I recommend is as a very refreshing and entertaining thriller.

B001FB5634|3.0|This is a tough movie to review. The book by Cormac McCarthy is a modern masterpiece, and I believe, fully deserved the Pulitzer Prize which it won. Part of the beauty of the book is its intimacy, the sense that you are there with these two people at the end of the world. The movie is well acted, well written, and faithfully recreates the events described in the book, but was unable to adequately convey this sense of \\"being there.\\" The film makers really faced an impossible task, as the source material is so difficult to translate into film. I was also surprised they did not incorporate the beautiful, enigmatic, passage about the trout which ends the book, and which obliquely conveys the sense of things lost. Anyway, the film was a valiant effort, but I think, somehow missed the mark.

B003O5MO6G|5.0|With their first two albums, \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" (June, 1965) and \\"Turn! Turn! Turn\\" (December, 1965), the Byrds introduced the world to the new hybrid of folk and rock. Their following album, \\"Fifth Dimension\\" (1966), saw the Byrds continue with folk-rock but also experiment with new musical styles including jazz-rock, raga-rock, country-rock, and psychedelic-rock. \\"Fifth Dimension\\" was a bit of a discordant mess but proved to be a necessary step in the Byrds exploration of alternative musical genres. The next three Byrds albums are considered among the finest albums ever recorded by a rock band.<br /><br />Jim McGuinn (lead guitar), David Crosby (rhythm guitar), Chris Hillman (bass), and Michael Clarke (drums) entered Columbia's Hollywood studios on November 28, 1966 to begin work on their fourth album, \\"Younger Than Yesterday.\\" Gary Usher was brought in as producer after working on Gene Clark's solo debut, \\"Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers.\\" Recording sessions for the new album concluded on December 8.<br /><br />\\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" explored many of the same musical styles of \\"Fifth Dimension,\\" but the songwriting and performances are much more accomplished. The album is distinguished by Crosby's emergence as the dominant artistic force in the band. Also, Chris Hillman contributes songs for the first time including two country-influenced numbers that presage country-rock. McGuinn, such a force on the first three albums, takes a noticeable back seat to Crosby and Hillman on this album. Producer Usher used several recording techniques associated with psychedelic-rock including reverse tape effects.<br /><br />\\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" was released on February 6, 1967 and peaked at #24 on the LP chart. The single, \\"So You Want To Be A Rock And Roll Star\\"/\\"Everybody's Been Burned\\" was released on January 9, 1967 and peaked at #29. \\"My Back Pages\\"/\\"Renaissance Fair\\" was released March 13 and peaked at #30. \\"Have You Seen Her Face\\"/\\"Don't Make Waves\\" was released May 22 and peaked at #74.<br /><br />Critical and popular reception of \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" at the time of its release was only lukewarm. Many rock listeners equated the Byrds with the pass&eacute; folk-rock sound of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man.\\" But \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" has gained increasing recognition over the years as one of the very best rock albums of the 1960s. Rolling Stone selected it as #124 on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list published in 2003. In 2007, USA Today included \\"Younger Than Yesterday\\" as one of the 20 albums that defined 1967's \\"Summer of Love.\\"<br /><br />Side One:<br /><br />\\"So You Want To Be A Rock `N' Roll Star\\" (Hillman/McGuinn) - Hillman's lively rip on the Monkees is fabulous. Hugh Masekela's trumpet is the first brass used on a Byrds song.<br /><br />\\"Have You Seen Her Face\\" (Hillman) - Hillman does a nice Beatles imitation. Love the chorus.<br /><br />\\"C.T.A.-102\\" (McGuinn/Hippard) - McGuinn explores the space aliens theme again. I like this novelty song, full of amusing special effects, much better than \\"Mr. Spaceman.\\"<br /><br />\\"Renaissance Fair\\" (Crosby/McGuinn) - Crosby's beautiful ode to a hippy happening. Exquisite.<br /><br />\\"Time Between\\" (Hillman) - Hillman steers the Byrds down a country road. Clarence White provides some extremely tasty licks. Nice little tune.<br /><br />\\"Everybody's Been Burned\\" (Crosby) - McGuinn criticized this as Crosby's lounge song but it's a stunner. Crosby's velvet voice combined with Hillman's rambling bass and McGuinn's solo make this one of the very best Byrds songs. Written by Crosby prior to the Byrds.<br /><br />Side Two:<br /><br />\\"Thoughts and Words\\" (Hillman) - Beatles-like tune on acid with lots of backward guitar.<br /><br />\\"Mind Gardens\\" (Crosby) - Crosby goes way over the top with this melody-less, self-indulgent number. But I still like it. Lots of backward guitar. Groovy, man.<br /><br />\\"My Back Pages\\" (Dylan) - Crosby fought like hell to keep this song off the album, insisting it was a regression to the folk-rock style of \\"Mr. Tambourine Man.\\" The Byrds' last Top-40 single. Great McGuinn Rickenbacker solo that stuck in my head for years.<br /><br />\\"The Girl With No Name\\" (Hillman) - Another Hillman country excursion. That's Clarence White once again adding some wonderful guitar licks. Girl Freiberg was an actual person.<br /><br />\\"Why\\" (McGuinn/Crosby) - It's hard to understand why Crosby insisted \\"Why\\" be included on the album. A gutsier version had already been released long before as the B-side of \\"Eight Miles High.\\"<br /><br />The following album outtakes were included in the 1996 CD reissue:<br /><br />\\"It Happens Each Day\\" (Crosby) - Crosby should have fought for the inclusion of this number instead of \\"Why.\\" Has a Jefferson Airplane feel to it.<br /><br />\\"Don't Make Waves\\" (McGuinn/Hillman) - Used on the soundtrack of the Tony Curtis/Claudia Cardinale movie by the same title. Embarrassing.<br /><br />\\"My Back Pages\\" (Dylan) - Alternate version.<br /><br />\\"Mind Gardens\\" (Crosby) - Alternate version. Simpler, gentler take.<br /><br />\\"Lady Friend\\" (Crosby) - Recorded over several sessions in the spring of 1967. Crosby kicked the other Byrds out of the studio and recorded the multiple vocal tracks all by himself. Released as a single on July 13 with \\"Old John Robertson.\\" Peaked at #82.<br /><br />\\"Old John Robertson\\" (McGuinn/Hillman) - A country song with strings in the bridge.

B0067QPVJ6|1.0|When they say `this is not a remake', it! is! a remake of Carpenter's film minus everything that made that film decades ahead of its time. The 2011 film and the 1982 film are companion pieces?  Why watch the same film twice with different actors? The only difference is the dog chase is at the end of one and the beginning of the other. The 2011 THING is a film that gleefully throws the intelligence of its viewers into a snowpit to soon be charred by its flamethrower.  It's a prequel but changes events from Carpenter's film defeating the purpose of being a companion piece. The Thing `11 has the alien burst out of the ice block to avoid showing what it looks like. The bizarre alien transformation scenes from Carpenter's film are in this new film less gradual and spectacular and decidedly more instantaneous, inauthentic and a blur of motion.  The director cut out Colin's death scene and we're left thinking, `Why isn't this in the film?'  The expectations for a horrifying ride where we witness the Norwegian camp turned into the war zone Copper and Mac eventually visit sink like a Snocat plunging into an ice cave. The Norwegians aren't underdeveloped characters, they are spectators in what was supposed to be their story. The focus is placed on American characters. Yes, American characters. The alien in an ice block isn't the only unexpected visitor arriving to the Norwegian camp. Norwegians travel halfway across the world for a novice paleontologist, as an excuse to import American characters back to their camp.  This film cheapens the `82 version because it shows the alien lacking cunning or intelligence. It is not the same deadly adversary portrayed in the '82 film. It is not a worthy adversary when defeated by its own ineptitude.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't think I've ever read a Sci-Fi book before let alone a series. That didn't stop me from giving this author a try. I bought this edition right after reading the first installment. Just had to see how it all ends. Very glad it hasn't--yet.  Some stories vanish from your mind as soon as you stop reading them. They simply don't stick. But this one, this one sticks. Like others have said, I couldn't put it down. Stayed up to 5am Monday morning finishing it. And even now, I'm still thinking about it, which is what prompted me to write this review. To be honest, this book doesn't need a review. The story speaks for itself. And those of us who've had the pleasure of reading it can't wait until the author releases the rest of it.  The price of this piece should be at least $1 more, so get it while you can. Get it and enjoy an outstanding story.  Oh yeah, where's Hollywood? Someone in Tinsel Town ought to give this author a call and see about bringing this tale to life. It truly deserves it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game. easy interface.  the games are a little hard sometimes but it makes it challenging. can't wait to unlock them all.

0441013597|1.0|Dune is one of my favorite books (series!) ever. But after reading the reviews here (and on iBooks) and after reading a few pages on a friends' Kindle all I can say is shame on you Amazon (and Apple). C'mon folks. At least run a frickin' spell checker before you try to screw me out of 15 bucks! The translation from the original is abysmal.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|highly suggest it as reading material for young and old alike.  it is an excellent story that doesnt have a fairy tale ending OR a bombshell disappointment as you read the last words.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Great app. Have really enjoyed it so far. Different then regular mahjong. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Download it today :-)
B00729GQ0A|5.0|First let me start by saying that I am going to try and write this review without spoiling anything for those who have not read this yet. I really have only one word for this book AMAZING from start to finish.  One of my favorite things about this book is you really get to know the characters. You get a back story on quiet a few of them and I like that in a book. It is because of this that you get so wrapped up in the characters and what they are going through. I feel like Sophia is my best friend and I truly care about what happens to her. Sophia is a bit of an outcast. The town she lives in and even her mother don't understand her Wiccan beliefs.  She is hearing voices that she just wants to get rid of. It is these voices that are the start to all of her problems. At first the voices are a jumbled up mess that she can't understand. But then things start to become clearer as she learns about her past, her future and her abilities. Rebecca has created a very imaginative world that introduces you to some interesting characters with some equally interesting abilities and pasts. Along the way Sophia meets some new friends of course some enemies and finds love. Now on to my favorite part of any book, the romance or love story and this book definitely did not disappoint with regards to that! Let me tell you Rebecca Hamilton knows how to write a love story. There are some intense scenes with Sophia and her love interest that left me with butterflies in my tummy. This story is so well written and descriptive that you can see in your head what is happening as you are reading it. Now if you are thinking this is just another vampire love story you couldn't be more wrong. There is so much more to it than that. It is supernatural, a history lesson and love story all rolled into one. Once you pick it up you will not be able to put it down. I would highly recommend this novel. I know that I cannot wait to find out what happens next! So what are you waiting for? Head to the linksposted up top and get reading!!!!  One more thing I have some thoughts about a bird named Red.

B007B6VOG0|3.0|I have to say I am a little disapointed with the album. There a few really great tracks, but overall as an album, I'm not feeling it. I guess Nate Ruess said he was listening to a lot of Hip Hop which inspired a lot of the songs on this album. But whereas good hip hop is repetitive but interesting, a lot of the songs on Some Nights are repetitive and monotonous. Aim and Ignite was such a dynamite album I guess I just set my expectations too high. Changing your sound isn't a bad thing if you can pull it off. Some nights isn't a bad album, but it is definitely not a great one.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|very good. graphics and playability are excellent, and they managr to bring some varjiety in a fun but otherwise very plain game
B004SEUJK0|4.0|Just happened to come across this movie at the library, by random chance, and picked it up for a laugh. Well, that worked out even better than I would have hoped. There are some scenes and lines in this movie that made me chuckle, and others that had me laughing out loud. Just wish I wouldn't have waited so long. I ordered a copy for myself so I can watch this a few more times, as needed. If this version has the same extras I saw on the library copy, they are worth a look, too.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|App works great on my EVO and gives interesting effects not found in other apps. I like that it has sliders to adjust effects and you can preview the degree of change.
0316017930|5.0|According to Malcolm Gladwell, an outlier is a person who has surpassed the realm of normal.  In his book, Outliers, he describes people that he terms \\"outliers\\" and their journey.  This book describes outliers such as Bill Gates, Christopher Langan, and several others.  Their journeys were researched and proven to be classified as an outlier.  Gladwell's thesis demonstrates a mathematical and statistical correlation between success and opportunity.  He terms this correlation as \\"outlier.\\"  In chapter two,  Gladwell discusses  the business success of Bill Gates's.  Gladwell wrote, \\"Brilliant, young math whiz discovers computer programming.  Drops out of Harvard.  Starts a little computer company called Microsoft with his friends.\\"  Before reading this book this is what the history of his success was understood to be.  However, throughout the chapter, Gladwell proved Gates's opportunities and how they mathematically enabled him to become a business mogul.  Bill Gates's opportunities included ten thousand hours of practice, which affirms Gladwell's theory of expertise that was expounded on in his book.  Other factors were his access to a computer, as well as his obsession with programming. These opportunities gave him the experience to become one of the most famous business moguls of today.  In contrast, in chapter four, Gladwell described the association between opportunities,  success, and hindrances.  He introduced Christopher Langan, who is one of the most brilliant men in America but is not considered successful.  He came from a broken home and a deprived lifestyle, and never completed a college education.  Langan proved Gladwell's theory that opportunities bring success and hindrances derail success.  Subsequently,  he lives on a secluded horse farm in Missouri and is unknown despite his brilliance.  Both Bill Gates and Christopher Langan are outliers; however, each man's outcome was different based on their opportunities.  Gladwell's style in writing was very clear and comprehensible.  He stated his thesis, and then he wrote story upon story proving his point.  Each chapter began with a quote that was relevant to the chapter.  However, the chapter had to be read before understanding the quote.  In a chapter which described Korean plane crashes, Gladwell over extended his thesis beyond logical limits.  The chapter was written in technical terms, and one's interest could be lost after the first few sentences.  It did not explain Gladwell's theory about the road to success the way all the other stories did in the book.  It is hard to connect Canadian hockey players to Korean pilots.  Malcolm Gladwell is also the author of Blink and The Tipping Point which were both #1 international bestsellers.  These books illustrated the way people think and the way people interpret the world.  His third book Outliers is a book that gives its readers a new approach to understanding  success.  He mathematically derived a connection between success and opportunities.  He then supported his thesis with many interesting examples of outliers taken from the fabric of society and their unique journeys.
0345440927|4.0|I loved \\"Secrets of the Baby Whisperer\\" - exceptionally good, practical, but not predictable advice for first time moms. This follow up book was a no-brainer.
0525425578|5.0|I have been a fan of John Grisham's books since The Runaway Jury, but it didn't click with me immediately that these books are written for young readers!  The shorter chapters should have clued me in, but I was there to be entertained and I was.  When I finished reading Theodore Boone, Kid Lawyer I said to my husband, \\"He has never written a book that didn't resolve all of its issues, but that's what he's done here.  Now I have to read the next one!\\"  So, this mother of 4 and grandmother of 12 was thoroughly entertained with both of the Boone books and I plan to pass them on to the grandchildren.  I'm not sure their parents are ready for them yet!
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|It's hard to review a TV Serial Drama like Downton Abbey without spoilers, but I will be careful not to say anything specific about plot lines. First off, the quality of the Blu-ray disc is fantastic. The images are tack-sharp, the audio quality is brilliant, and the menus are simple and easy to navigate.<br /><br />Season Two finds Downton Abbey a couple of years later than it was when Season One ended. WWI is well underway, and the war not only impacts each character in some way, but also the estate itself. There are some interesting story lines around the use of the home during the war. And, there are obviously many interesting story lines around how the characters are affected by the war and the changing times. It is nice to watch some of the characters' personalities take on added dimensions - particularly the Crawley daughters.<br /><br />A couple of the plot elements of Season Two are a little more soap-opera than I generally like, but this series is so good, and the characters and stories are so intricate and escaping, that I can overlook those. They really don't take away from the overall story, but they might make you roll your eyes a bit. But there are also some deeper, darker, and far more mysterious twists that unfold in Season Two. Of particular interest (to me) was the continuation of the budding relationship between Mr. Bates and Anna... one that is a far cry from a fairy-tale. And of course, the evil pair of plotters are still at it - and doing even more harm than they did in Season One. They are the pair that you love to hate.<br /><br />I was very glad they included the Christmas special in this set. It really does belong with the rest of the season's episodes, and it helps to cheer the somber mood that the final few episodes leave you with. It also sets the stage for a great season three.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have about Season Two, is that it ends. And we must now wait for season three.
B000O7ZZOU|5.0|If you like animals and medicine, this is the book for you.  Thoroughly enjoyable reading about rural England where James Herriot had his veterinary practice for many years.  You'll read about difficult deliveries of young farm animals in the cold, damp air of the English countryside and the many amusing clients who frequented his practice, both the animals and their owners.  There is no foul language and there are no sordid affairs to clutter the amazing life and times of this remarkable Veterinarian.  I found it refreshing.

0765322889|5.0|Like some reviewers - by page 60 I was scratching my head with wonderment. \\"Where is this going?\\" I thought. However, after a few more pages (and reading the back of the book flap - which always helps, Folks) - All became clearer.  A lot of people will not like this series - because they have been spoon fed on simpler worlds - black and white characters, young man goes on quest, cute Elves, friendly Mages, etc. However - Here is a book where you have to do a little work. This is a world that comes right at you with a slew of gray characters, lots of butt kickin' action, great atmosphere, Darkness, Ambiguity, Cool Magic & Ancient Lore out the wazoo. Lot's of detail and yes...one can get lost in the Malazan series - but to me that's part of the fun. Erickson uses a spinning coin throughout this novel and to me he couldn't have picked a better analogy. Who knows which side will face up?  While I am not a huge lover of Sci/Fantasy novels there have been several series recently worthy of some attention (ie Martin's Game of Thrones, Patrick Rothfuss' Name of the Wind. These are books that elevate the genre - and I would place this book & series at the top of the list. Why? Because of it's scope, depth, complexity and...well, it's just a damn good story with interesting characters you can care about. For those who complain - I say \\"What more could you want?\\" This is truly a revelatory work on how good a Fantasy can be.  For optimum enjoyment - take your time, pay attention to EVERYTHING and if need be -read the back of the book flap and refer to Glossary of Characters often. This will give you a signpost to where you & the story are headed. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the Malazan Book of the Fallen series \\"Deadhouse Gates.\\"

B00117U1FK|5.0|I had heard of Supernatural, but until this past week, I had not taken the time to explore it. I have to say that I am sad that I waited this long to check it out. I have fallen in love with this series and I can see why others have as well!<br /><br />First off you have Dean and Sam(my), two brothers who have been through hell and back. When Sam was just 6 months old, his mother was killed by a demon who tried to take Sam and the rest of his family out as well. Thanks to their father, Dean (the oldest) and Sam made it out alive, but their mother burned with the house. Heartbroken, the father sets out for revenge while taking his sons with him.<br /><br />When the series starts, you open up to Dean, fully grown, asking Sam, a college boy ready to graduate, to help him find their father who has been gone too long on a 'hunting trip'. Sam had long ago left the life of a hunter in hopes of normalcy, but he was never normal. Once again he is pulled back into the life of a Hunter as he and Dean try to find their dad while saving people along the way.<br /><br />Each episodes opens to a different paranormal event, and each gets better than the last. While on their travels, the boys must learn to work together and get along, but that doesn't always happen. Each is hiding something from the other, whether its insecurity, jealousy, or a hidden and deep secret. Those hidden emotions and feelings only cause the boys to bump heads along their journey, but they still manage to function as a team. Blood truly is thicker than water in this series! The search continues for their dad, bringing with it trepidation as the boys grow closer, especially considering that their dad is the one sending them on missions while he looks for the killer of their mother.<br /><br />Sam's insecurity and Deans feelings of hurt and betrayal from his brothers abandoning him and their father pushes the boys harder than they will ever know. In this particular episode, The Benders, Sam and Dean head to Minnesota, where a young boy witnesses a man disappear. While investigating, Sam is also abducted. Dean pretends to be a police officer in search of his brother, and teams up with Deputy Kathleen(Jessica Steen). Although she soon learns Dean's not who he claims to be; however, she allows him to continue investigating with her, as her own brother went missing in the same manner three years earlier. Despite this, she does not trust him, and handcuffs him to her car when they find the kidnappers' property. Kathleen is soon captured, and learns that the culprits are a human family who hunt and kill people for the fun of it. Dean manages to free himself and goes after her, but is also captured. However, this distracts the family long enough for Sam and Kathleen to break out from their cages, and the three of them subdue their captors.

As the hunt for the missing campers continue, it slowly becomes obvious that it is not a bear or tiger responsible for the disappearances, but something much nastier.

0812992792|4.0|I have read almost nothing about the Koreas, and reading this dark tale of repression, violence and love was like being strapped to a rocket and launched into unknown territory.  It took me awhile to get into it initially, but I was soon hooked.  I personally liked the second part of the novel more than the first, unlike some reviewers. I really was not bothered by the \\"disjointed\\" style, although I flinched each time a section began \\"Citizens.\\"  I particularly enjoyed the North Korean characterization of Americans and some of our habits. Some were pretty humorous and at least partially true.  It's not an easy novel to read, but I like the dark ones, and I'm glad I read it. I teach several sections of world literature and had hoped this might be an addition to my curriculum, but my senior students would surely get migraines.  Oh, well, I am richer for having read it.
B00715SUI6|2.0|First and foremost, there are no such things as ghosts, demons, angels, witches, sasquatch, wizards... You get the idea. I enjoy supernatural horror for the same reasons I enjoy zombie flicks, crappy alien movies, etc., because they are an escape from the every day reality of life. This entire series of movies was mediocre, with painfully delivered dialogue and only your basic boo-and-jump moments scattered through. This one was easily the worst of the three as it brought in the element of a coven of old lady witches to explain the \\"origins\\" of the fictional villain. The parallel was unnecessary in that it brought no additional believability or involvement to the story, much like the map argument in Blair Witch.<br /><br />All told, if you're a fan of the genre the you should watch it. Maybe you'll get something out of it that I didn't.<br /><br />But rent it, don't buy it. It's not a watch-more-than-once type of a film.
1594203334|4.0|Full disclosure:  I was a nanny in Paris 15 years ago and carry the city in my heart.  It's a great book!  I have to assume that the Parisians described in the book to represent French people are as exaggerated as the New Yorkers she chooses to represent Americans.  I couldn't always identify with what \\"Americans\\" do and think, but it's a small matter.  The book was hugely entertaining and informative.  I found myself rooting for her, her children, and her husband to--I don't know--make it in France, keep \\"sage\\" and happy, and make friends.  So as a narrative, it was great.  As a guidebook (which it was and at the same time was not), I also found it very interesting.  My 2 month old, HALLELUJAH!, is sleeping through the night after one lousy week of The Pause.  She never cries for long and not more than 1 time a night.  That is worth the cost of 100 of this book.  Also, my 15 month old seems to enjoy her meals more when I display the food, have her help me in the kitchen, and describe flavors.  It's fun for both of us.  I am working with her to quiet her fits and to understand her motives.  I feel empowered and encouraged to change how I address my family, to use reason, to use the framework of \\"education\\" instead of \\"respect.\\"  It's all little things, and very common sense (for Frenchies, though I as I read I discovered how many things about raising children I'd like to modify for my family).  A pleasure to read.
B000001EXR|5.0|As an original member of the Kiss Army, I tapered off after Animalize and the Elder was...well, some things are best not spoken.  I think as we get older, our tastes become a little more sophisticated as we become aware of more styles of music, discard what's popular and find what works for you.  The journey is the absolute best for everyone who got a shudder when they first heard the opening rift to \\"Smoke on the Water.\\"  KISS always attempted to swing with trends, but that isn't always necessary - nor true to the fan base that brought them to the dance.  Then I heard \\"Domino\\" and thought...huh.  Sounds like they finally got a guitarist who can set his own trends and plays with the bravado that I came to expect as a teen with cuts like Cold Gin, Rock Bottom and Deuce.  Personally, I felt Revenge was as much as a redefining of a core on the level of \\"Keep the Faith\\" was with Bon Jovi.  That experience that says, \\"if we put all of the marketing, all the agents, all the crowds behind and just cut what we KNOW is our music.\\"  Then Carnival of Souls witch I feel is a refinement of that core took back seat to the marketing, agents and crowds and thus the 1st of MANY farewell tours took to the road.  I am beyond pleased that Carnival of Souls made its way to the light of day. It is their best work.  Period.

0307352145|3.0|As I read the book I kept having \\"Aha\\" moments as I recognized the problems I had to overcome at achool and work. Then I got to the conclusion and the advice on page 265: \\"Quit your job as a TV anchor and get a degree in library science.\\"  I hope the author was joking. First, the job market for librarians is the worst in 50 years, and the pay is abysmal.  Second, libraries are not the quiet sanctuaries for introverts they are imagined to be. Besides managing the book collection, librarians are expected to entertain toddlers at story hours, visit schools to drum up business, teach classes on how to use the Internet, fight for funding from indifferent Boards of Trustees, and supervise parolees doing community service. Third, the cataloging and technical support jobs that would be most suitable for an introvert are being outsourced or deleted due to automation.  Perhaps in a future edition of the book the author could suggest a better alternative career.

B0068MNO4S|5.0|`All art is political, otherwise it would just be decoration.' ANONYMOUS is first and foremost a beautifully crafted film  - script, direction, lighting, costume, music, cinematography, acting - and whether or not the viewer buys into the premise that the plays and sonnets of Shakespeare were the work of Edward de Vere instead of the apparently illiterate actor 'William Shakspar' is unimportant.  Controversy abounds in every field of study - politics, religion, science, poetry, the origin of man, etc - so the veracity of the film's take on history is not the issue.  The film so beautifully brings to life the period of Queen Elizabeth and the flavor of those times and so richly floods the screen with delicious dialogue and comedy and human frailty that it is immensely successful. Roland Emmerich directs with a firm grasp on Elizabethan ambience and John Orloff's screenplay is wholly convincing.<br /><br />The film's beginning - after Derek Jacobi introduces the concept of the possible misconception of the true William Shakespeare's identity to a contemporary audience, underlining the fact that Shakespeare is as alive today as when the following story begins - is a bit difficult to follow as the timeframes change back and forth throughout the film to make the story plausible. The young Queen Elizabeth (Joely Richardson, daughter of Vanessa Redgrave who plays the aged Elizabeth later) is a flirt and has affairs, one with the young Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford (Jamie Campbell Bower), becomes pregnant, and gives birth to a son whom the Earl is banned from ever seeing or knowing.  Years later their son is the Earl of Southhampton (Xavier Samuel). Edward de Vere as the older Earl of Oxford (Rhys Ifans in a brilliant performance) who rather than tend to wealth prefers to write plays, works that he passes on to Ben Jonson (Samuel Armesto) in whose theater the plays are performed by an `anonymous' playwright.  The plays have become the favorite entertainment of the aged Elizabeth I (now Vanessa Redgrave) and De Vere soon feels the need to protect his privacy and asks Jonson to accept credit for writing the plays, but Jonson in turn passes that authorship to an illiterate actor named William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall) who uses the lie to increase his popularity and wealth.<br /><br />Coloring the atmosphere is the palace intrigue of who will be Elizabeth's heir - and the Cecils (David Thewlis father and Edward Hogg son) decide it must be James of Scotland (not a choice Elizabeth would make).  But since only Elizabeth and de Vere know who the blood heir is the intrigue passes into near warfare with the Essex rebellion against the Queen.<br /><br />Many of the known characters of the period are included  - Christopher Marlowe (Trystan Gravelle), the Earl of Essex (Sam Reid) - making the notion of keeping tack of all the derring-do of the court a bit tedious at times.  But there are so very many moments of memorable beauty in this film that the occasional befuddlement of who is who and what is what simply doesn't matter.  Whether the viewer buys into the identity of William Shakespeare as history has described him or to this far more credible story of the man responsible for writing the greatest plays the world has ever known is inconsequential.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|best mahjong app I've seen. love that you have achievements to get. also very easy to see open tiles... major plus!
B005HSL626|3.0|the app is ok. the game is pretty fun but there are way to many adds. it is also a pretty easy game. I wouldn't. make this review not make you get bealcause it is fun just a little heads up.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|Let me preface this review by saying that DSOTM is my favorite album ever and most people who will be looking at this product page would already be familiar with the content of the album, so I won't get into the details of the music itself, and my review will be primarily concerned with the Bluray audio disc of this collection as it is the main attraction. If you haven't heard the album, just get it by any means ASAP.<br /><br />Now for this particular edition, it is everything a fan could ask for and more. I had the SACD and a bootleg of the Quad version on DVD-A so I've heard the album in surround plenty, but the quality of the versions on the Bluray disc of this collection take the cake all around. I always preferred the Quad version to the 5.1 SACD but this uncompressed 5.1 mix adds a level of spacial immersion that was previously unheard. You get plenty of the individual channel separation and all the joy that brings, but there isn't so much separation and all the channels have some crossover or fade between the others for the greater part of most of the songs, giving the listener the impression that they are completely surrounded and bathed, immersed in the sound, rather than simply having four different sounds simultaneously flung at them from four different directions (or five).<br /><br />Some people claim that the analog connection and direct nature of the SACD sounds the best out of any musical formats, but I have listened to both the SACD and Bluray side-by-side and the uncompressed audio on the BR has greater fidelity and a more crisp and even natural sound than the SACD.<br /><br />As for the extras in this new box set, they're icing on the cake, just the things to make a Floyd fan happy. Three marbles with the DSOTM image that you can lose, several collectible coasters with artwork on one side, a fantastic art print that looks perfect framed on the wall, along with an art book and a tour photo book, as well as some collectors cards and an envelope filled with memorabilia (a ticket to one of the shows of the original tour and a backstage pass to said show). That is to say nothing of the other CD's and DVD of the collection, but I haven't explored those too much, and they contain the original mixes along with lower-quality surround versions and some video material from various shows from the tour.<br /><br />All in all, for a true fan of the Floyd and Dark Side of the Moon, this is a perfect purchase/gift, for the Bluray audio alone if for nothing else. This is the ultimate collector's collection, the perfectionist's complete edition, and simply the best version of the best album that exists.to one of the shows of the original tour and a backstage pass to said show).

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is awesome and you don't need wi ti to play trust me. it is really fun and addicting. there are like 100 levels it is even free don't waste your money on the expensive one I mean seriously. get the app
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this was a fun little way to waste some time but that's about all it is good for. so don't get it looking for something amazing.
B004EPZ06G|4.0|I got this for my husband who loves the first \\"hangover\\" movie!! He liked it, but said that it wasn't as funny as the first part. For me, I thought it was just as good, I didn't really find the first part that funny, it's a weird humor, but second part I enjoyed more. All and all it's a fun movie to watch.
B004EPZ00M|5.0|I went to watch this wonderful movie in the theater with my friends and I was amazed at how wonderful it was. I also watched the first one when it came out in 2003 it was also funny and awesome. Rowan Atkinson is one great actor that I admire. I have watched the first one 87 times and the second one 3 times already. Both of them have great story lines, amazing actors and yet a relativly low budget. All the action is mindblowing and in Johnny  English Reborn, you would never know what was going to happen in the end on your first time watching it. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes watching movies between the ages of 2 and 94!!! TOTALLY 10/10
B006ON41FC|5.0|really fun. the challenges are awesome. little hard though. i think people should buy it. really fun to play. nothing wrong the perfect game.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this is a. wonderful app. I just wish I could get it without having to have wifi. it even reads the words for you. I love this app on my kindle fire.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Awesome game perfect for the kindle fire!  Prepare to be addicted with challenging levels! Graphics are awesome too! 5 stars for sure!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|This arm does exactly what I wanted: to hold my monitor securely at the proper eye level.  -I liked having the \\"edge of desk clamp\\" as well as the \\"through a hole in the desk\\" mounting. I thought I'd use the edge of desk clamp but the through a hole in the desk worked best for my setup.  -The mounting bracket adapter for my 20\\" monitor worked without problem.  -Do not be concerned the unit is difficult to move when taking it out of the box. The joints are tight as that is what is needed when you get it set up and have 5+ Pounds of a monitor hanging 16\\" out in space. The monitor is held tight and does not wiggle.  -Some reviews had fault with the wire holders, I think they are fine, but I set the monitor and do not move it.  -Bottom line is I'd buy this again if I need another monitor arm.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun,challenging, enjoy playing, relaxing, this is a good app with other available options, have fun and play, see if you can win
B00007LTIA|5.0|I was twenty three years old when this album came out and had already seen Yes four or five times. I went on to see them fifty times, including one last time with \\"that other guy that sings\\" and am waiting for the return of Jon Anderson, if that ever happens. If not . . . well Jon, thanks for over forty years of music. We'll miss you. I witnessed the live performance of this entire album at Nassau Coliseum in the summer of '73. Yes, Jon Anderson said \\"we'd like to continue with the four tracks off our new album . . .\\" and there it was. So over the top by the end with all the stage props for Alan White (the manta ray thingy over the drum kit) and Rick Wakeman (whatever the structure behind his keyboards was supposed to resemble is still beyond me), the smoke, lights and \\"music\\" of the ending of the fourth movement. Totally blew my mind, although I was already quite high. I just finished listening to this entire album today (2/21/12) after seeing it while putting back cds in my cabinet and deciding to take a short trip down memory lane. It's still one of my favorite Yes albums even though it probably did alienate many fans. Then following up with \\"Relayer\\" further distanced the fan base. Whatever. Bands will sometimes do that. Take Queen for instance. \\"Hot Space\\" and \\"The Game.\\" Thankfully they came back around. With TFTO you either like it or not as with most Yes music. No in-between with this group. I did get to see the first movement live recently, about five years ago and it still kicked ass, especially Wakeman's keyboard solo. Shook the building in '73 and still can. Bottom line . . . you either get it . . . or not. If you do . . . then good for you.  PS: currently a major Dream Theater fan.  I've seen the about a dozen times already. Ask any one of them what they think of Yes and what do you think they'll say?
0143120255|5.0|Witty and fun comparisons that aren't a bit 'odious' unless you'd rather live in the opposite city..like Paris and who wouldn't? Visually and graphically arresting. Each city's icons do a face-off. I'll take Amelie over Carrie anyday. Or would I?
B0067Q42BY|4.0|wish the tiles would stay zoomed in and show board but cant have it both ways. Must zoom out to see entire board but since tiles too small must zoom in often to see better.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this game is fun, full featured. I like all the different levels and prizes. keeps me entertained for hours. I recommend it highly!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|fun game with a neat story and great tiles. tiles and graphics are really nice. game moves along nicely. fun game.
B001OGWY1W|3.0|I saw this film on an airplane on my laptop because it had been sitting on the hard drive. The graphics were very good, the acting was decent, the action was unbelievable and the rubble used was of both high in quality and quantity. This is the ideal films for people who love blockbusters, super hero films and strong villains. I don't think there is anything different here in terms of the story line.<br /><br />Christian Bale acted well, the late Heath Ledger was good too but overall the film doesn't have enough grey to intrigue one beyond the 153 minutes it runs for. I'm not into superhero films and think this is about as good as they get. To me, Nolan's masterpiece was The Prestige.
0143120581|5.0|I myself am Chinese and my husband is Jewish. Reading this book makes us wonder how we will be with our future children. We both know that I was raised with a Tiger mother and he was raised in a very open minded family.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|This app is good for those times that I don't have wi-fi. The only thing I don't like is how many points you have yo earn before you can unlock the next game. You have yo play the same games over several times.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is fun and easy. Something anyone could enjoy! My whole family can play this and offer diiffent versions of this game to play.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is fun and addictive.  Very creative and ever changing.  I would definitely recommend this game. I personally like old school games like Mario, tetris, word games, and puzzle games. I am not getting this game for free for writing a review.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|this is such a good movie, and it was awesome to watch it in blue ray. super quality! it comes with a dvd and digital copy too, which is good if you have kids and their tv has only a dvd player.

0385344325|4.0|It began long ago in the multiple award winning debut novel Killing Floor. 16 novels later the backstory of why Jack Reacher, US Army MP, left the service is finally told in The Affair.<br /><br />It is 1997 and there is a problem in Mississippi. Somebody killed the very beautiful 27 year old Janice May Chapman in Carter Crossing. The problem for the military is the fact that quite possibly somebody from the nearby army base, Fort Kelhem, might be involved. Army Rangers, two different elite companies, are currently station at Fort Kelham while rotating in and out of Kosovo in an attempt to prevent war. There is some circumstantial evidence that a service member stationed at the base is involved. Not to mention the fact that one of the company commanders is connected politically to a powerful United Stated Senator who also happens to be the chairman of the armed service committee. A thorny problem and one that needs to be dealt with quietly and discreetly.<br /><br />So the plan is to send in an obvious investigator, an MP by the name of Duncan Munro to the base while Reacher does some undercover work in the local small town of Carter Crossing, Mississippi. He's supposed to act like an aimless ex-military guy and drift around town gathering intel. As part of that he is supposed to somehow develop a relationship with local law enforcement so that he can keep an eye on both aspects, civilian and military, of the investigation.<br /><br />The job and the plan sounds relatively simple in the office of his superior officer. It is far different when Reacher is boots on the ground at the target trying to complete the mission. Not only complete the stated mission but the implied mission of protecting the United States Army at all costs. A tall order for Reacher and the case that changed everything.<br /><br /> Occasionally a bit graphic in terms of sexual contact between Reacher and a female character, the read steadily powers forth at a good clip as the numbers of players and complexity of the situation exponentially increases. The novel explains in detail many character traits that are now old hat for Reacher fans while at the sometime making those same traits seem fresh to the reader familiar with the series. Story/Plot complexity, as happens in all of the novels in the series, plays a huge roll here with the typical initial simple setup morphing into a complex situation with lots of moving pieces with public and private agendas.<br /><br />The only negative is the author's frequent reminders to the reader that it is 1997. The entire novel is of a flashback containing an additional extended flashback.  While the technique worked it is diminished in its effectiveness by repeated reminders that the book is a flashback. Author Lee Child frequently inserts lines such as \\"No hold music at Treasury, either, back in 1997.\\" (Page 155)  Or \\"This was already 1997, remember.\\" (page 208) there are numerous such reminders throughout the book with each one serving to jerk the reader back into the present day after shattering the artificial and engrossing world of  The Affair.<br /><br />That annoyance aside, overall the novel is another solidity good one in a long line of good Reacher novels. Though entirely a backstory novel, for the most part the 405 plus pages novel is done very well. Author Lee Child manages to make the Reacher character new again for long time fans while also creating a powerful prequel to the only running series. Filled with plenty of action, complex characters, a perplexing case, the readers is a good one where justice is finally served in typical Reacher fashion.<br /><br />Material supplied by the good folks of the Plano Texas Public Library System.<br /><br />Kevin R.

B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Beautiful, soulful,and soothing this CD of real Hawaiian music is the perfect antidote when modern, technology-laden living feels frenzied and frantic. I haven't seen the movie, but the recent books Unfamiliar Fishes and Lost Kingdom inspired me to investigate the unique music of the only state that was ever a sovereign nation.
B005HSG3U6|2.0|When I opened this I was disappointed.  It was very flimsy and not very stable when sitting on a table with the Kindle in it.  I returned it and purchased a better folio cover at Target.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Let's see, I can listen to this CD over and over and never ever get tired of it. The music, the lyrics, the unbelievable VOICE. Yes it's my favorite album of all time. On the DVD Adele is charming and funny and the best singer I've ever seen. What I wouldn't give to see her perform live. Until then I'll just keep watching this DVD. Until I have to order another one because I've worn this one out. Highly highly recommend.
B006BZ8WAI|1.0|KoRn got themselves back on the right track when they released KoRn III: Remember Who You Are in 2010. Prior to 2010 they had released two back to back terrible albums in See You On The Other Side (2005) and Untitled (2007), the latter being particularly horrible. I, along with many other fans, began to question the direction KoRn was going in with their music. What happened to the heavy, raw sounding riffs found on their albums released in the 90s?  Then they came out with Korn III: Remember Who You Are, an album which saw the band return to their roots. I thought KoRn was back and and heavy as ever. Then I heard they were releasing a dubstep album. I was intrigued at first, but after one spin of this CD I again found myself questioning the direction of KoRn.  This album is flat out terrible. It lacks creativity. These guys jumped on the latest trend and produced an album that is just plain trash. Dubstep was cool for what, 5 or 6 months? The production is terrible.  If anything, this should have been a Jonathan Davis side project. This is rubbish for a nu-metal band, and shouldn't be mentioned alongside the name KoRn. KoRn, you seem to have forgot your roots. Release this under a different band name than KoRn, then I wouldn't feel so bad about it.  We want KoRn, not this!

B006470HZ6|1.0|What a disgrace the 2nd season has been... I've NEVER seen a series do such a 180, I wouldn't have imagined it was even possible.  Season 1, had multiple locations, an epic journey into Atlanta, time on the road, the CDC, action, conflict, meaningful character conflict and interaction... all in 6 episodes.  Season 2, has had 9 episodes of JACK... I literally can only remember 1 or 2 mildly significant character events, that did nothing to advance the story... What used to be a tense event now might as well be the freakn survivor, with a bunch of twits bitching at each other... Seriously, the show is SUPPOSED to be about zombies, but there have been maybe 15 mins of zombie action in the entire second season.  It's the LEAST tense show I'm [for now] watching. WHY HAVE THEY WASTED AN ENTIRE SEASON AND OUR TIME?  I think the producers felt safe when they saw the numbers... They maybe thought they could sit on their hands and maybe rack up 12 seasons, using the great material already in Kirkman's comic. Yes, I liked season 1 so much I went and read the first series of comics in my life... There is enough material there for 5+ seasons (and counting) of the best show on TV. If they stretch it to 12, it will be cancelled by season 4.  They are absolutely blowing it... If they don't get back on track I AM GOING TO QUIT WATCHING. These episodes can be summarized in sentences, it's a joke.  Did they cut the shows budget by 80%? Do they only have enough money for Whiney House on the Prarie?  \\"Do something!!!... Or get off the @#$%ing stage!\\"

B001SGEUNI|4.0|No doubt this band is professional sounding all the way. Don't be fooled by the popular video for \\"Familiar Taste of Poison\\" with a softer melodic feel, the rest of the songs rock hard. YouTube has videos for a few of their other songs proving this: \\"I Get Off\\" vid has a sorta old school Joan Jett feel that rocks hard; \\"It's Not You\\" and \\"Love/Hate Heartbreak\\" bring the heart of their sound out nicely.<br />If you like straight shot rock women (with a classic Joan Jett aura) then this is for you.

B004BJMEO6|5.0|This is the best lesbian film I've ever seen.  It's a film that would not just be appealing to a gay/lesbian audience but to anyone.  The storyline is so wonderful and touching.  It's full of emotion, life lessons, humor, great writing and directing and so much more.  It also dosn't fail in the sexy category :)  These characters are so real and have such great chemistry on screen that it makes the movie that much more believeable.  With great acting, great music, great storyline....Elena Undone is a must see.  Absolutely wonderful film!  Nicole Conn doesn't let us down with this one!
B005QI4TP8|3.0|First of all let me state this: I absolutely adore Florence and The Machine. I think she is one of the more intriguing female artists to break into mainstream music in the last five years. No one else in popular music at the moment (except perhaps Adele) has a such a visceral voice. She is one of the few artists to emerge from a credibly 'indie' background and go on to have commercial success. This is all despite a deeply underwhelming sophomore album.  Her debut [[ASIN:B002F6FQGK Lungs]] heralded the brightest of prospects. It had immense charm, character, relevance and most importantly variety. The album had Welch traversing many different genres from baroque pop ([[ASIN:B002F6JPF8 I'm Not Calling You A Liar]]) to shades of garage rock ([[ASIN:B002F6HS0M Kiss With A Fist]]). It's variety was endearing and ultimately made for very enjoyable listening.  As a result, I awaited the release of [[ASIN:B005RAO0GS Ceremonials]] with great anticipation. This was aided by the release of the singles [[ASIN:B005RAO0PY What The Water Gave Me]] and the incredible [[ASIN:B005RAO0O0 Shake It Out]]. However, upon first listening I was troubled by it's apparent mediocrity. Some albums fall under the 'grower' category and further listening ensued. Finally, I have come to realize that this album in no way eclipses or even matches it's predecessor.  Songs such as [[ASIN:B002F6LQCS Dog Days Are Over]] and [[ASIN:B002F6HRYY Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)]] are perfect examples of Florence's signature sound; harps, loud anthem choruses and multi-tracked vocals. The main problem with the songs on her sophomore album is that almost every single song uses this exact formula, with the only real change being the adding of choirs (see [[ASIN:B005RAO28Y No Light, No Light]]).  Her debut album has a feeling of spontaneity and variety. It seems that in making this album Florence made a conscious decision (or perhaps producer Paul Epworth did) to create a more cohesive affair. This excessive cohesionis it's downfall. The entire album blends from track to track. Even the standout track [[ASIN:B005RAO0O0 Shake It Out]], simply sounds like a reworked \\"Dog Days\\".  In all honesty the album is boring from beginning to end and is saved only by Florence herself and the simple fact that while repetitive, her trusted \\"Harp + Anthem + Big Vocals = Song\\" does work in places and brings moments of magic, such as the exquisite Only If For A Night. In no way do I hate this album. However, considering the magic that she showed us on Lungs, this is just rather lackluster.  6/10.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have always used Lowepro bags and was about to spend $200 for the Lowepro Vertex 100 AW backpack.  The I stumbled upon the Amazon Basics Camera backpack.  I figured for $35 how could I go wrong, even if I hated it, I could give as a gift.  Well was I pleasantly surprised when I was able to fit (2) Nikon Bodies, (3) Len's, SB-700 flash, and many, many other accessories.  Everything fits nice & neat.  Each piece is snug in it's designated slot.  I highly recommend this case to any semi-pro/pro potographer.  Thank you Amazon for a great economical alternative.
B005ELQVGW|3.0|Alongside with Florence and The Machine's [[ASIN:B005RAO0GS Ceremonials]], Bjork's latest offering was the biggest disappointment of 2011 for me (musically speaking of course). It's hard to articulate just how dissatisfied I was. Bjork holds such a huge place in my life; I have listened to and loved every album she has released over her unparalleled career, her songs have personal resonance and I have been utterly obsessed with her my whole life. I was initially hesitant in writing this review because as with myself, many will think that anything Bjork creates is perfect. Until now.  This album is a logical progression from the more intimate and stark moments of it's predecessor [[ASIN:B000NVIXFA Volta]]. The songs are backed largely by obscure electronic instruments and her usual choral cohorts. In interviews she has stated that she wished to unite music and nature. The lyrics of songs like [[ASIN:B005Q2XX8I Mutual Core]] and [[ASIN:B005Q2XXVU Dark Matter (With Choir & Organ)]] are typical of the album's preoccupation with elemental, scientific and Earthen imagery. The often bizarre instrumentation somehow accompanies this quite well. Bjork has managed to combine the technological with the natural not only lyrically and aurally but also aesthetically.  That being said however, the lyrics are not of the usual Bjork standard. Given, Bjork has never been a poetic lyricist of the Joni Mitchell or Patti Smith order, but she has always previously had a knack for crafting insightful and emotive lyrics. Here, they seem slightly cliched. They seem too obvious, whereas on past albums there has always been a level of depth in her lyrics, on [[ASIN:B005Q2XTLY Biophilia]] there seems to be no emotion. That is perhaps as a result of the natural rather than humane subject matter.  Bjork is also a master of composition. Past work such as [[ASIN:B000002HPV Homogenic]] and [[ASIN:B00120E7FQ Medulla]] are so ornately detailed and written their tracks can almost be considered scores.However, the songs on this album are discordant, pedestrian and at their worst tuneless. Bjork often lets her ambition and imagination get the better of her, for example on [[ASIN:B005Q2XX1A Sacrifice]] which is quite truly an awful song suffering from some weird chiming, over the top electronic beats and off-kilter vocals. There are some moments of brilliance especially on the gorgeous [[ASIN:B005Q2XVMQ Cosmogony]] which harks to her past collaborations with Antony Hegarty. However, these moments are few and far between to consider the album wholly beautiful.  So, it is with immense regret that I admit this is by far Bjork's worst album. Hopefully a blip on the trajectory of a career which hopefully has many more classics left to add to her canon.  5/10
1400069289|5.0|What's the difference between a person who runs a mile a day and a person who smokes a pack a day? Not as much as you might think. While the first person undoubtedly has the better habit, both of them probably follow their routines without a moment's thought. In fact, there was a man who lost his memory to point where he didn't know where his kitchen was, but if he wanted a sandwich, he had no trouble going to the refrigerator to make one.  The key to dealing with habits, argues author Duhigg, is to understand what they are. Whether you're forming a good habit or getting rid of a bad one, the first thing you have to understand is that habits aren't about judgement or willpower, they're about habit. That means to form a habit, you need to link it with a cue you'll respond to automatically. And to get rid of a habit, you'll need to redirect its triggers to something else.  The Power of Habit isn't just a self-help book, by the way. The main focus, in fact, is on the scientific research about what goes on in the basal ganglia and how that differs from what happens when we're thinking more consciously. From anecdotes about people to research on mice (all with neat and simple illustrations of the processes involved), you'll learn about the biology of habit, how it manifests in the world around you and what you can do about it. For real insight into all those things we do on autopilot, and how to set a better course for yourself, The Power of Habit is a fun and riveting read.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|At first I was a little hesitant in buying this book because when I read that it had sexual content I excepted full out. Surprisingly it was a wonderful book that didn't have that much content. You had a scene here and there but when you got passed that there was romance, poker, fights, and humor.  If there was on thing I could change would be all the fighting Abby and Travis did. Plus I didn't much care for Abby's friend, America. I really recomend this book the only probelm I have now because of this book is finding one that doesn't sound boring. After you finish this book you just want to find ten more like it.

B002SSBD6W|5.0|I've been a vegetarian for about 16 years so I went into this book thinking, \\"I've heard it all before.\\" I loved Foer's other books though, so I figured even if I was being told information I'd heard before, I would still like it. I was definitely wrong.  Foer presented a case for vegetarianism (though, he provides that this was not his goal) and/or ethical eating that was new to me. He doesn't rely on the traditional methods such as detailing the violence experienced by farmed animals, though the book does not lack in descriptions of it. More, he tells the story of \\"farms\\" through an ecological lens, detailing how factory farming affects humans in more ways than just digesting in their stomachs. There was a lot of information new to me such as the amount of antibiotics forced upon animals (17.5 million pounds annually) compared to the amount used by humans (3 million pounds annually), the fact that the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by the agriculture industry is 40% higher than the entire transportation sector, and the root causes of pandemic viruses. Very eye opening! If I were not already a vegetarian, I definitely would be one after reading this book!  Overall, I loved that this book did not push anything in your face and he spoke so warmly about the traditional farmers he met along the way. I appreciated that this was his personal story he was sharing and not an attempt to sway public opinion; as a vegetarian, I'm often accused of trying to convince others to give up meat just by my very existence. I'm very persistent in saying that vegetarianism is a personal choice. Do I think more people should give up meat? Of course. Is that my choice to make? No. This book uses this premise to tell its story, making it informative without being aggressive. I think non-vegetarians will not be threatened by it, allowing them to be informed and thus make better decisions about how and what to eat.
B006YXTRHY|4.0|Girl falls in love with guy, girl marries guy, girl goes honeymoon with guy, girl makes love with guy, girl gets pregnant. This is what the storyline is all about. Except that each part of it is made according to every girl's dream: Guy is sickly pale but handsome and loaded, wedding gown is designer tailored, honeymoon is chauffeur driven through the streets of Rio before speedboating to a reclusive private seafront bungalow. Then both swim in birthday suits in open sea under full moon light, passionate love making till the pillows burst and the bed frame collaspe. Everything goes well until guy decides to celibate. Then sex resumes again and girl gets pregnant. Nice movie.

B00005JKMQ|4.0|\\"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, rumble young man rumble.\\" My black brother.  The DVD could not have arrived at a better time, when Smokin' Joe Frazier, some said Ali's shadow, juz went RIP.  Do not watch it if you are looking for another instalment of the Rocky series. There is no scene of one-arm push ups nor running the Rocky steps up n down in front of Philidelphia museum.  Will smith ...looks a bit small size for a heavy weight champ tough.  The soundtrack is superb. Soul and RnB or whatever u called it. Beatles fans will be thrilled as the name is mentioned in one scene.  The black liberation movement, his women, conversion to Islam, his running-away, dodging, refusal, whatever u call it, from the Vietnam war drafting, his big mouth with ryhme, all are presented in the movie.  But somehow the movie ended rather abruptly with the fight with George Foreman.  Ain't no fan of boxing (too violent) but this is a nice movie that narrates the partial life story of a champ. Worth to spend the Friday night in punggol with 2 bottles of red wine and wife-prepared food with this dvd.

0718157672|5.0|Anyone who has seen or read much of Jamie Oliver knows that his great passion is to get people eating \\"proper\\" food. But he is also aware that with today's busy lifestyle, the temptation to settle for quick and easy takeaways is overwhelming for many people.  Hence, 'Thirty Minute Meals', where Jamie shows you how preparing a proper home-cooked meal can be just as quick, simple, and inexpensive as going out for a curry or fish-and-chips. Each recipe really is for an entire meal of at least 3 and up to 5-6 courses, including entree, main, salad, side dish, drink, and desert. Through some clever ingredient selection, innovative cooking techniques, and a few short-cuts, Jamie proves you really can cook these multi-course meals in 30 minutes (well....maybe 40-50 for wannabe home cooks like me!).  Each recipe is well set-out, and deliberately planned to make your cooking as efficient as possible and eliminate down-time. Simple things like spending a minute to organise all your equipment so you won't waste time searching for utensils, or pre-heating ovens and pans, which are common sense but are often overlooked when cooking at home. You will definitely need to learn to multi-task, but it is manageable provided you follow the directions very closely. The fast paced and to-the-point style has attracted some criticism for a lack of a human touch, but Jamie himself acknowledges that his aim is to get you in the kitchen and cooking, not reading pages of personal anecdotes. This is a \\"cook\\" book, not a \\"food story\\" book.  There is a good variety in the recipes here: from Asian-style stir fries to curries, from steak and chops to traditional roast dinners. The ingredient selection and matching of each dish's components are excellent, providing a great balance of flavours for each meal. Although designed to be cooked and eaten as a whole meal, you can of course pick and choose between the individual dishes, or even mix and match from different recipes, if that's to your taste (although Jamie discourages this....).  On a personal note, having many friends and relatives of Chinese descent, we really appreciated this book for its more \\"Chinese\\"-style approach to dining; several different courses and dishes, with everyone able to take as much or as little of each course according to their own taste. It's a welcome contrast from some of Jamie's very \\"British\\" style one-pot recipes in his other books.  I also really appreciated the checklist of essential equipment and utensils at the beginning of the book. A few things I'd never previously thought of, such as oven-proof saucepans, have been particularly useful for our cooking.  In all, this is just a fantastic cook book, certainly one of the best and most useful I own. Great recipes, with detailed step-by-step instructions, that can be cooked in (just over) 30 minutes. Probably one of the best ways to encourage today's busy working people to start eating \\"real food\\" again, as well as being an excellent cook book in its own right.  Five stars.

0062082353|1.0|This book is TOTALLY over-rated.  I am really shocked that this book got so many 5-star reviews.  I've read every sniper book there is, but this one was really sub-par, especially considering the possibilites due to Chris Kyles extensive career.  There are no details at all in reference to the combat.....the book gives more details to his personal life and things that were done in his down-time.  His description of time behind the rifle was like an afterthought.  He sets up battle plans and how an attack would unfold....then, when it comes down to him engaging targets, it was basically \\"the insurgents finally withdrew....I got several kills.\\"  I am not questioning the the authors experience, more his writing and story telling.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the only series that each time I rewatch, I find something new about it, and I've watched it more than 5 times. For a series with a platoon-sized cast, you'd think it's hard to relate to the characters, but no, as the characters meet one another, we get to know them, we follow them from the beginning 'til end, and grow to love them. It's that attachment to characters that makes war so disturbing.

I was working across the street in La Pomme so she waved at all of us waiting tables and looking out the window waving to her.

B006O5YHUY|5.0|You really can't say enough about this movie. It's astounding, the actors are beyond words and the story line keeps you invested in both brothers I love Tom Hardy he's perfect in his role. This movie did not get nearly enough credit, they did a wonderful job portraying MMA, and the fights were true to styles and tactics. The background story adds to the emotion and everything together just makes for a wonderful movie to have in a collection of honor, family and self worth. Great movie, amazing story. Watch it.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This movie does Charlotte Bronte proud. Too many period movies put an actor or actress in the lead role who are very good-looking when the part calls for a plain person. Mia Wasikowska, though interesting-looking, is not by any means gorgeous. I think she's the perfect Jane. Her acting ability is fantastic. While trying to hold on to her reserve, you can see the emotions just under the surface.  Michael Fassbender may be a tad too handsome, but his acting is believable.  Beautiful cinemetography.  I don't watch many movies more than once, but this is one I'll probably watch yearly.
0385474547|1.0|How the heck is this book green-lighted in schools?  This is THEE most degrading book I've ever had to read.  Honestly, how is a story about a sinfully prideful man, who beats his family (wives and kids) and acts like a total whiny, savage a** throughout the entire novel; how does that seem okay over a banned book, such as Animal Farm, which has some of the best references to Stalin and Russia, as well as using animals as victims in the telling?  And let's be honest. Animal Farm actually IS interesting cause the author uses animals creatively to hide the darker undertones. It's clever and easier to read than this piece of trash they call Things Fall Apart.  TFA is just a major drag because it reads too much like text from a history book.  Seriously, who the heck wants to read a textbook for a reading assignment? Especially when high schools are trying to force this garbage down their students' throats.  The writing is sloppy and immediately turns the reader off with the mundane tone and overuse of African words they cannot define without the help of a translation guide / dictionary in the back of the book.  And then there's the abusive nature of the protagonist, who I cannot name cause I've scrubbed this book out of the existence of my mind (till today of course; still tastes like garbage after all these years).  Oh. My. Word.  How DARE we let children read this book. We have ENOUGH domestic violence in the United States.  And yet this book is still being forced upon students?  Newsflash: Harry Potter may have witchcraft, but I think a child is intelligent enough to recognize reality from fantasy.  Animal Farm is so cleverly written that it can actually pass for a children's book, when you get down to the basic format of the text itself. (come on, animal stories always get green-lighted)  Both works are FANTASY / ALLEGORY either way.  But with TFA...urgh.  Any child could try to read this book and they'd be upset that a man is beating his family.  And domestic violence is not entertaining to watch nor is it something anyone should be forced to read about, in GRAVE, EXPLICIT DETAIL, like in this book.  In fact, have any African natives ever read this book?  I imagine they must be pretty dang embarrassed with how Achebe degrades his own country with horrendous novel.  tl;dr: go read Animal Farm. Stay away from Things Fall Apart.  I'll spoil the story for ya, those who need help:  The main protagonist BAWS about how \\"tough\\" his life is, beats his family, then \\"accidentally\\" shoots a villager and is forced into exile. Comes home 7 years later and sees the White Man has ruined everything, so he commits suicide like the typical emo jerk he is.  Oh and the #1 symbol in the book is Yams. A freaking vegetable.  Yeah.  Just goes to show the creativity that went into this novel.  Which is NONE.

B000000HXK|5.0|\\"Hex\\" is one of a handful of landmarks in the post-rock genre. Unfortunately, its creation destroyed the band as they spent nearly a year laboring over these sublime sounds and, as a result, were no longer interested in working together (which is a crime). This is a tremendous, literate, mellifluous collection of sounds and if you're a fan of late-era Talk Talk (\\"[[ASIN:B000006UNG The Colour Of Spring]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B000005RS5 Spirit of Eden]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B000W2742I Laughing Stock]]\\") you'll likely groove to these shimmering tracks. I'd rate Talk Talk a bit higher (they blazed this trail and \\"Hex\\" is a bit derivative by comparison), but there's no mistaking the lush, innovative noise contained herein.

B003UMW69I|4.0|Very good movie.  At first I was hesitant due to it being another Rom-Com but I was surprised.  The backdrop is awesome and looks fantastic in 1080p.  It's a funny yet a bit predictable story.  All in all, it's one that has made our repeat viewing list.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I just got this app today after a friend show it to me and I'm already addicted I mean who dosent like squirels.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read this book two times already..  I can say now that it is my favorite book of all time.  So well written, engaging, powerful characters, such a great story.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I love everything Celtic Woman does! And this is another GREAT example of their lovely angelic voices!  I go to see them whenever they are in St. Louis!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This. is the most wonderful app!  Love all the translation choices, search features, audio feature, but especially love the ability to share verses with others with a touch of my finger!!!!  I use this app all the time -  I LOVE IT!!!
0385534639|4.0|Fantastic, but definitely not plot based. If you consider yourself someone who is good at visualizing things you read then this is the book for you. Although at some points confusing, it has great imagery. The plot is not very easy to follow chronologically I recommend it.
B0033AI41G|5.0|Russell Crowe brings an honesty to the character that not many others could. Entertaining, but bitterly touching at the same time. The audience is left feeling bad for the character, something many current movies fail to do, as they instead focus on special effects or 3D. Not the case with this movie.
0545425115|1.0|Do not read this book.  This woman is a thief and a plagiarist.  She stole this trash from Koushun Takami. Over a decade ago he wrote Battle Royale,  a fantastic novel about children sent by the autocratic government to an island so they can compete to the death. The whole novel is stolen. How she got away with this is insane. It is fair enough to take inspiration from other works, and no novel can really claim to be truly, 100% original, but this is just ridiculous. She has has stolen a novel, sucked out all the emotional and creative brilliance and then slapped her name on it.  If you like the idea behind this piece of trash then please read Battle Royale. It is an infintely greater work.
B000VDDWE2|4.0|Sure, the scenario isn't completely convincing, but the idea of a catastrophe happening overnight can't really be expected to be. At least it's entertaining, if only for a few hours. Its cheesy attempt at political relevance and overblown special effects make certain of that fact. It could be MUCH worse (Gigli, anyone?)
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Being a Mahjong addict, I generally try all the editions I discover. This brand has great graphics, a smooth yet simple storyline and premise, and fluid game play. Better than the rest I have tried- keep up the great work G5 Entertainment!
0385504209|4.0|While it has been a couple years since reading The Da Vinci Code and the specifics of the plot have faded, I do remember it as a very engaging read. Dan Brown's book keeps you on your toes (and fingertips) as you turn each page.<br /><br />Brown's incorporation of sites, art, and history create a world in that wonderful realm of \\"conceivably true.\\" It is this quality that draws the reader in. He mixes facts with fiction so seamlessly that the reader is left with a very immersive and almost believable experience. My only complaint is that the plot seemed to lack some of its previous strength as finish.<br /><br />However, this book is definitely a page turner. If you want a book that will keep you until the end, this book has my recommendation. I enjoyed it enough to read Angels and Demons as well, but enjoyed this one more.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|This is a very dull film. I cannot believe it made the best of 2011 lists for Roger Ebert and his two critics.  I expect it will be dissected in high school English classes for years to come as students try and impose some meaning on the \\"Symbolism\\" and \\"metaphor\\" of this film.  I want my 2 hours back!
B006LEHOL2|5.0|I have listening this CD in the NPR radio website , and I thought it was OK, but after listening again, it has great flow , great lyrics, and her voice still amazing. listen to it.
B0070Z97LG|2.0|extremley dissapointing. I had it figured out within the first 20 minutes. Not happy that I paid 4.99 to rent so not worth it :(
B0067Q42BY|2.0|Nice graphics but for some reason to select a tile is a mirrored image on the vtab. Makes the game super hard to play.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I knew that I would want a  protective cover for my Kindle Fire immediately.  This one fits the bill perfectly.  It is lightweight, fits the Kindle Fire well and is able to be used as an easel .  I like the strap that can be used to keep it closed also. Lacks nothing. Is getting slightly worn on the bottom edge that I use to open it, but not badly.
B004XE0TDW|5.0|Been a long-term fan of Justin Vernon and his various collaborations/projects --- this record seems to continue to sound found in \\"For Emma, Forever Ago,\\" but on a grander scale.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Bon Iver, know that you won't get pop-predicatable vocals or easy-lyrics --- you will however discover of crew of musicians and songwriters working together along side Justin Vernon to pay delicate attention to the subtleties and magic of experimental play in music --- I don't know a lot about how to accurately describe music, but for me, they create a sound that is sincere.  With Justin's raw, crooning vocals, and sweeping instrumentals that seem to rise and fall through the combinations of acoustic and tempered brass... take your time with this music, and treat it with respect.  This music is not a quick fix to simply fill the empty void in your head --- rather, toward the right listeners, it seems to resonate and reflect something profound, unique to each individual user --- take a chance, or if in doubt, sample before buying sillies!!! :D<br /><br />*Also, and speaking from experience, they sound a million times better --- LIVE.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|O.K., I'm getting on the Bruno bandwagon a bit late as I don't listen to pop radio or watch much t.v. And I am 65 years old.  But I've got to say that I love this album and feel that this young man has a wonderful future in front of him. This will sound crazy but I am likening him to the late Michael Jackson, whom I also adored. Pop stars come and pop stars go...some stay around simply due to good marketing but that is not what is happening here. He is standing proud on his own talent. May fame go easy on him.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I.love this game it is solo addicting mymom told me to do my chores but I was platting this game so I got kindle taken away intill I did them I did them in like five.minuetes because I wanted to get back to the game
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Raw, shocking, nearly perfect. This series isn't just for teens, it's for anyone who appreciates a good read. I imagine that each generation will have different reactions and takeaways. Just from reading some other reviews, it's amazing to me to see this same book enjoyed by everyone from a teen, to \\"cookie mom\\", to veteran, to myself, an unapologetic 30-something yuppie. This installment was my least favorite, but not due to the writing, but rather the emotion it elicited within me. The characters you've come to love and hate have changed, and you can't get them back. Suzanne Collins body-slams the reader into a harsh reality with this last novel, and it hurts, by god, it hurts. Like another reviewer, I felt positively exhausted at the end, and it will take me some time to recover.
B0063IH60K|5.0|ive played on the computer before and I became hooked instantly... that was 15 years ago. this is my all time favorite. and now that I have it on my Kindle Fire I'm even happier. love this app.
0060555661|5.0|What I liked most about this book was the most comprehensive analysis of risk that I have ever come across in one book.  It covers risk tolerance of the investor, as well as the risk of the investment, and everything in between.  Once you understand your risk tolerance and the risk of the investment, you are 95% of the way to making the proper decisions about investing.  Highly recommended!<br /> - Aimee Elizabeth, Author of Poverty Sucks! How to Become a Self-Made Millionaire.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Wow!  They're really kicking ass with this new album A Different Kind Of Truth. It is H E A V Y ! ! !  I haven't been listening to Van Halen for a while, probably missed out alot, but this album is nothing less than cracking. And with 'good old' David Lee Roth on vocals again.  I think they delivered one of the best Van Halen albums here but I admit I heard it just now! On every classic metalalbum there's a song or two that stand out and tops the rest. On this album I'm totally blown away by As Is, Honeybabysweetiedoll and Beats Workin'. Some awesome tracks.  What also helps is the outstanding production. All is so perfectly clear.  Some reviewers are having serious doubts about the album and underrate the band's performance. Don't mind that. It's a great Van Halen album, most likely one of their best and a very recommended purchase.  What a great surprise!
B000ICXQS8|1.0|I was so bored watching this movie. There was so little dialogue, so it was hard to get into the storyline, and what little dialogue there was seemed to mostly be arguing/yelling. The storyline moved along pretty slowly, and the love scenes were kind of violent, which was very awkward to me. The ending seemed abrupt and random, and was just depressing. I was hoping that this movie would live up to the good reviews, but it just didn't for me. Two hours of my life I'll never get back...
B005K17RU0|4.0|koolbeans, like this app a lot, works excellent, don't need anything mote,,, what else could you want out of a weather app
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book. Great story line. I loved the all of the moral and ethical dilemmas throughout the book. Would highly recommend to anyone!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|First of all, I'd like to make it clear that I will be reviewing aspects of the Kindle edition and also the Hunger Games trilogy itself.  This series was recommended to me by a friend and I was told it was a definite must read. I chose to purchase the Kindle edition because it offered all three books for around $17. I figured this would be my best bet money wise and I also loved the fact that I would have all three books immediately in my hands. When purchasing from the Kindle store, you are promised to have your book within a minute of clicking the purchase button. My decision of purchasing the trilogy through Kindle was greatly based on the price comparison of the hardback trilogy and the Kindle edition trilogy. According to Amazon, the Kindle edition of the Hunger Games is $16.85 so roughly $17 and the hardcover trilogy is almost $31. In my eyes, there was no doubt about the Kindle edition being the more reasonable purchase.  I'm still quite unsure and confused on how Kindle formats their book, in regards to font sizes and page numbers. I understand that Kindle users have the option of changing their font size to increase or decrease the character size. When a user increases the font size this also changes the number of pages they have to read in order to finish the book. A second issue dealing with the font size is that sometimes out of the blue, the font will just change when you change to the next page. This has never been a major problem for me but it threw me off guard and was a little unsettling for my eyes. The page numbers in Kindles can be very confusing and I for one haven't figured out the method yet. This usually wouldn't be a big deal but when you try to compare the Kindle edition to the actual hardcopy of that book, it can be very frustrating trying to match up the page numbers. Although, there were a few minor problems with the Kindle edition of the trilogy, I'm still very happy that I made the purchase. I loved the fact that I received all three books at the same time and I could carry all three of them around with me within a device that was a centimeter thick.  As for the Hunger Games trilogy itself, I had absolutely zero complaints. As I began the first book, I was sort of confused but still very intrigued. Not until I heard someone else talking about the book, did I realize it was based in the future. The basic story line of the book is that the USA had destroyed itself and all that was left was a land called Panem. This consisted of 13 districts and a Capitol city. The people that lived within the Capitol were the wealthiest of all the people. The 12 districts that housed mostly underprivileged people had a different lifestyle all together. They had to work within their district's industry and many times went without food and any type of comfortable living. Each year, the Capitol would put on the Hunger Games in order to punish the districts and remind them how they ruined civilization. A girl and boy from each district were randomly chosen to fight to the death within a challenge-filled arena. Katniss and Peeta's lives were forever changed when they were chosen as tributes for the annual Hunger Games. You get to know the characters in great detail throughout the book when they are faced with adventure, challenge, death and even romance.  As the series goes on, you learn more and more about the characters, the Capitol and the real reasons behind the Hunger Games. At some points, you may find yourself wanting to jump into the book and join the rebellion against the hated Capitol. The romance that was once a huge factor in the games begins to die down but the action and mystery only increases.  Suzanne Collins does an absolutely amazing job of painting the romance, gruesome deaths and cut-throat action into the pages of the Hunger Games trilogy. Once I started the first book, I was fully intrigued and it was very hard for me to set my Kindle down. I would recommend this book to any person of any age. I know you can't always rely on the movie being as good as the book but I cannot wait until the movies comes out to see if I painted the same thrilling picture in my head.

0307887898|3.0|The premise of 'The Lean Startup' is that entrepreneurship isn't something people are born with. It's not being ultra creative, being well connected, or working out of a garage. According to Ries, entrepreneurship is a set of processes, and like anything else, can be learned.<br /><br />Whether an entrepreneur is conscious of it or not, he engages in certain behaviors. These make up the chapters of the book. Ideas like 'experiment' 'learn' and 'measure' are ideas Ries touts, along with case studies for real world examples.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ries makes it seem that entrepreneurship is only in the tech industry (all the case studies were websites or an app of some kind). I would have liked him to showcase entrepreneurship across activities other people can relate to, such as restaurants, apparel, and health clubs.<br /><br />The book, physically, is not lean (over 300 pages). It seems like there are several chapters that could have been condensed or cut. Additionally, the book at times isn't exciting or engaging. It may not get your blood pumping enough to start something of your own.<br /><br />The Lean Startup website has good resources, and has meet ups across the country. Although the concept of a book on start up lessons is great, it could have been simplified and less cumbersome.

B003VXPKQW|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert does not want to get married, but marry she must if she wants to live in the United States with her honey.  The adage holds:  truth is stranger than fiction.  To work through her anxiety about marrying, Gilbert puts the institution under the microscope.  She talks to Hmong women in Cambodia who are far more pragmatic about marriage than we are in the U.S.  She examines early Christian attitudes toward marriage and finds, to my surprise, that marriage was discouraged since celibacy was the ideal of life.  She looks at the Old Testament tribes and how marriage was a form of protection in the openness of the desert.  Then she discusses, at great length, same sex marriage.  Mixed in with the historical examination of marriage is a very personal recounting of the marriages of her grandmother and mother.  Once broken down and examined, the giant and overwhelming machine of marriage becomes a collection of pixels- simultaneously a monolith and just two people at the kitchen table.  Similar to Eat, Pray, Love, Gilbert's tone is conversational, lively and very intimate. Like most things in life, the book's strength is also its weakness and it does ramble a bit and need some tightening up.  That being said, the book is very interesting and readable.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|Other reviews here have highlighted the movie's great qualities.  The movie gets 5 stars from me.<br /><br />It loses one star when it comes to retail and the customer experience: UltraViolet is a poorly implemented system that has caused Warner Bros. to hand out iTunes codes to dissatisfied UltraViolet customers.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I won't buy the Blu-Ray copy of this movie due to the poor digital version option.<br /><br />HOLLYWOOD: For now, your most appealing movie package is the Blu-Ray + DVD + DIGITAL copy one.  I pay the Blu-Ray premium for these!<br /><br />Otherwise, the savvy public is tempted to burn backup copies of their purchased DVD copies so they can watch them as they please.<br /><br />'nuff said.
0312370849|5.0|This story is so moving and captivating.  The author weaves the story smoothly, and  like an afghan, it comes together beautifully.  I envy people reading this book for  the first time; they will be caught up in a number of lives and learn history not  known to many.  I discovered many things I did not know.  The hippodrome part of the  book was horrific, and the French people feeling safe because they were taken by  French policemen...well, this was shocking to me. So much history here, and the  families involved... a learning expedrience for all.  Wonderful book, enjoy it!
B000022TSX|5.0|this movie is hilarious its basically just a really long episode its defiantly worth the money its a very good movie

B001PJRAUS|5.0|Historical fiction movie buffs and book nerds unite!  I found this movie appealed to the universal desire of avid readers to literally find escape in a good book! It's quite enjoyable if you suspend belief & just enjoy the ride. The production value is lacking somewhat, but not to the point that it detracts much from the story.

B005LAIGSM|4.0|Chick Flick Alert! We love 'em and aren't afraid to admit it. Happily, this sudsy PG-13 romance is based on a true story and we see a photo of the real people involved during the closing credits.<br /><br />What does a devoted husband do when the lovely young woman he courted, loved and married, is injured in a devastating accident? When she comes out of her medically induced coma, she has no idea who he is; she only remembers her OLD boyfriend and events from five years and earlier!<br /><br />Here are the principal players:<br />  * Tatum Channing (\\"Haywire\\") is Leo, a self-employed businessman who drops everything in an attempt to help his wife regain her memory. BTW, this actor does some of his best work with his shirt (and everything else) off. ...smile...<br />  * Rachel McAdams (\\"Sherlock Holmes\\") is Paige, daughter of a prominent judge. She hasn't been in touch with her family for five years but can't remember why. Nor can she remember why she dropped out of law school, or anything about a marriage to this nice stranger.<br />  * Jessica Lange (\\"American Horror Story\\") is Rita Thornton, our heroine's mother, who dashes to her daughter's hospital bedside, eager to bring her back to the bosom of the family.<br />  * Sam Neill (\\"The Hunter\\") is Bill Thornton, the judge who pulls strings to get his girl back into law school. He is somehow involved in the underlying reason why she can't recapture those past five years.<br />  * Scott Speedman (\\"The Moth Diaries\\") is Jeremy, the old beau. He is delighted to realize that his is the only relationship she remembers and he is yearning to start all over.<br /><br />So now we watch family dynamics, with the parents happy to leave her past forgotten, our forlorn husband trying to woo back his wife, her confusion when confronted with her recent art work, and her reaction when she goes back to law school.<br /><br />Only one person will sacrifice his own happiness to see HER happy. Who, you might ask? C'mon...it's a ChickFlick! I'll be happy when Amazon.com notifies me of the DVD release date.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was gripped to the first two books, not wanting to put it down between chapters. Didn't feel the same way with this one. Katniss' lethargy and depression got annoying and it was hard to like her anymore.  I was also disappointed with the ending and rushing of some important character deaths.
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|Navy SEALs are America's warriors du jour. Remember that spectacular demonstration of marksmanship when three of them, standing on a tossing boat, felled three hostage-holding Somali pirates with simultaneous shots? That was followed a year or so later by the end of Osama bin Laden, so these elite fighters are the ones we look to for military prowess.  I can only hope this film's regular release contains the introduction by the two principals behind this project. They were embedded with a platoon of Navy SEALs in hopes they would get enough material for a movie. It quickly became obvious to them that there are NO Hollywood actors who could approach the calibre of the men they were with, in terms of fitness, devotion to their families, intelligence, and skill levels. Consequently, they cast a group of active duty SEALs! (Shooting was occasionally delayed while cast members were briefly deployed.) When we know those guys up there on the screen have actually done the things we see, it adds immeasurably to our involvement; plus, many of the scenes were shot using live ammo!  The upshot is, even though the Bandido Platoon is a fictitious one, this story is based on feats of the most elite, highly trained group of effective warriors in the modern world, using up-to-the-minute technology under highly challenging circumstances. Because of artistic license, we see the same seven men off the coast of Somalia, in the Ukraine, in the tropical forests of Costa Rica and just south of the Mexican border. They are trying to stop a chilling plot that uses ceramic pellets in suicide vests. Ceramic doesn't set off metal detectors, so terrorists plan a coordinated attack in crowded areas: football games, shopping malls, concert arenas and airports. When explosives kill and maim hundreds, the economic impact will be devastating (like 9/11).  This film starts with the rescue of a kidnapped CIA operative, which leads to the terrorists, who are linked to drug cartels in Mexico (they know how to penetrate America's borders). The domino effect of international terrorism and drug trade is compelling stuff. How can the American drug consumer ignore the down-range impact of his or her folly! Expect lots of gunfire, SCUBA diving, some really satisfying blowie uppie stuff, and stealth warfare (when these seven guys silently break the surface of that stream... goosebumps!).  I found this far more involving than your average run-of-the-mill action film. It's clear that these guys are SEALs, not actors, but there wasn't a moment when anyone's attention strayed; we were rooting for them to complete their mission so they could all return home to their families. As the tag line says: The only easy day was yesterday.  I will request notification when this DVD is available on Amazon.com.

B007B8GI28|2.0|I like zombies and I like Dayle. I think he is the character I watch this show for and they are even trying to make him sappy. And the love triangle, you got to be kidding me. She asked him to stay. I swear that women is the dumbest person on the show. Really how long could she have thought her husband dead. He had on IV bag that may last about a day or two at most depending on how slow the drip was, than the body can only last a week with out water. I guess the lesson is that if you think you love one is dead and zombies walk the earth wait more than a week to sleep with their best friend.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought that it was a fun game with different types of games to play. The games were not to easy and not to hard.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is great there are lots of challenges and fun outfits. I would definantly buy it. buy it buy it
0345529057|3.0|After watching Game of Thrones on HBO, I was convinced I needed the books. The 4-book set appeared to be the best value, so I made the small investment and received them in a timely manner. I devoured the books in days, but that's all they needed to completely fall apart. I'm not hard on books, and most of my books (having been read and reread) still look like new. Large chunks of pages fell out and the spine of one book completely split in half. I was, luckily, still able to pass them on to my mom to read but she handed the first book back to me in a plastic bag as it had completely disintegrated. I know I'm paying a value price for this set of books, but I think they should be able to hold up to some normal wear and tear.  As for the books themselves, from Game of Thrones (1) up through A Storm of Swords (3), they kept getting better and better. A Feast for Crows (4) was a long and tiresome read that, for the most part, I had to force my way through. It was unnecessarily long and introduced new characters that I honestly had no interest in. As for A Dance with Dragons (not included in this set), after AFFC I probably won't make the effort having read other's reviews. Instead I will just wait the long wait for Winds of Winter and hope it stands up to A Storm of Swords!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this a is pretty cool still learning how to use it but fun wish u didn't have to use points to buy games
B005TZFZ9W|2.0|Call me a hater if you want, but this album is exactly whats wrong with Hip Hop today. I've never liked Tyga or the YMCMB camp (minus Drake), but I actually tried to listen to this album and it was a complete waste of my time. Tyga has been rapping since 2008 and first came out with a song called \\"Cocoanut Juice\\" and while not a pure hip hop song, that song was a lot more interesting than what Tyga has been coming out with the past 4 years. Careless World: Rise of the Last King suffers from pop garbage I hate hearing and it only appeals to the young and ignorant. All I've heard from Tyga throughout the entire album is pointless vulgarity about how much money he has, the women he can get, and the same chauvanistic bragging YMCMB is famous for. Not the mention the album cover and title share a slight resemblence to J. COLE's debut \\"Cole World: The Sideline Story\\" even his positioning on the album cover is similar to J. Cole's album cover. Wheres the originality Tyga?..........<br /><br />Once I seen the tracklisting and guest spots I was surprised because I saw a Hip Hop Legend (Nas) and my current favorite (J. Cole). Two profiecient MC's on an album with no substance so how is that gonna work out? The tracks \\"Show It\\" and \\"Kings & Queens\\" actually pushed Tyga to rap better, but ultimately becomes a failure once Nas and J. Cole start rapping and makes it easier for listeners to distinguish between a good MC (Nas, J. Cole) and a bad rapper (Tyga). The content of the album is my main problem, I just don't get what Tyga is trying to convince to his listeners, he's just not an interesting person to listen to, and his storytelling is very limited, just throwing out crappy metaphors that don't  connect with the songs subject matter (has Lil Wayne written all over it). When Tyga has songs like \\"Rack City\\", \\"Potty Mouth\\", \\"For The Fame\\", and \\"Mu********* Up\\", anything that Tyga says on any other song no longer becomes sincere nor convincing emotionally from there on. He tries to be \\"deep\\" on typical songs like \\"Far Away\\" & \\"Black Crowns\\", but it just doesn't connect with the type of persona Tyga has created for himself.<br /><br />The only thing that saves this album from 1 star is the productions. While Tyga's lyrics are garbage to say the least, the beats are a saving grace for me, some of these beats are actually some of the best I've heard in 2012 thus far.

The only song I actually found barable is the song \\"Light Dreams\\" feat. Marsha Ambrosius which is the LAST SONG on Careless World, this song was the first time I felt real emotions from Tyga's voice, not to mention the dark yet soulful productions. Other than that, this album is overrated and after a couple of months from now, it is going to be forgotten. Like I said before, Tyga is young so he is going to make music for young people that are interested in club songs and ignorant lyrics to make people feel like they're the s***. While that may be cool for some, the grown people who actually know what real music is will just laugh at Tyga's music. Tyga needs to grow up as a person and find his own sound instead of following the formula that is YMCMB, that is the only way he can become a better artist, because there is no way he can ever dream of getting a grammy with this type of music.ep\\" on typical songs like \\"Far Away\\" & \\"Black Crowns\\", but it just doesn't connect with the type of persona Tyga has created for himself.

1594481938|4.0|This was one of the cleverest little books I've read in quite a while.  You really wouldn't expect me to describe a book about suicide as \\"fun\\" and \\"entertaining\\", would you?  Oh, but it is...  with just enough gravity and genuine human insight to avoid becoming a farce. Four desperate people - Martin, Jess, Maureen and JJ - converge on the roof of Topper's House (a common suicide spot) on New Year's eve... and instead of jumping, they end up forming their own unlikely little alliance.  Their personalities are about as mismatched as one can imagine and ultimately make them a very funny bunch.<br /><br />The story is told in first person narrative from the points of view of all four of the central characters.  That storytelling approach was one of the best and most ingenious things about this novel.  The rapid-fire switch between narrators - often in the middle of a scene or bit of action - was absolutely brilliant and kept the narrative moving along at break-neck speed.  Each character had a unique style, delivery and outlook, though I will confess that in the latter part of the book, I sometimes forgot whether I was reading JJ's perspective or Martin's because their styles began to merge a bit.  I found myself looking back more than once in that second half of the novel to remind myself who was speaking - a sign that the uniqueness of the characters' narratives was beginning to flag.<br /><br />The characters themselves were perfect and each was developed through the firsthand telling of their own background story.  All four central characters were equally well-developed, and while I certainly had favorites and least favorites, the story would not have worked without any one of them.  The dialogue (both internal and external) sparkled throughout this book and is without a doubt the novel's greatest strength.<br /><br />Obviously, there is a healthy dose of humor in this novel, but there are serious moments as well... moments of near-surgical insight into the human condition, so perceptive that they gave me pause.  There are also elements of social satire that were truly amusing... particularly in terms of the sensationalistic tabloid media.  In short, this book had a bit of everything without ever feeling like Hornby was over-reaching or trying to do too much with one story.<br /><br />In addition to these things, Hornby also did his readers the favor of sparing us a \\"hearts-and-flowers\\" feel-good ending.  These are troubled people leading difficult lives and \\"happily ever after\\" just wouldn't have worked in this case.  Oddly though, this also gives rise to one complaint that I had about this book:  the fact that by the final third, it was apparent that there would be no real resolution for any of these people and as such, the story began to feel like it was treading water.  All things considered though, I don't know how else it could have been handled while still 'keeping it real', so to speak... so perhaps my complaint is unfair.<br /><br />The Bottom Line:  If you enjoy a tale that is darkly funny with razor-sharp dialogue, then A Long Way Down is worth a serious look.<br /><br />This review originally appeared on my blog.

014062029X|4.0|\\"For my part I don't see why men who have got wives, and don't want 'em, shouldn't get rid of 'em as these gipsy fellows do their old horses.\\"  ---The Mayor of Casterbridge<br /><br />And with those words (and the act they inspire), Michael Henchard brings a lifetime of misery down on himself.  The Mayor of Casterbridge is widely considered to be Thomas Hardy's greatest novel.  It is a classic tale of the spiral and eventual demise of an essentially bad man.  The story is rich with personal intrigue... sins, lies, cover-ups, love triangles, secret identities and so on... making it a continual pleasure to read.  The regional dialect (spelled phonetically throughout) can be a bit cumbersome to wade through at times, though it certainly lends atmosphere to the novel.<br /><br />The characters are interesting and easy to relate to and Hardy did an admirable job of making most of them distinctly human:  Michael Henchard is \\"bad\\" (as evidenced by the sale of his wife and child in the opening scene) but is also carefully drawn as essentially flawed and insecure, rather than a flat parody of evil.  Donald Farfrae, who is as good as Henchard is bad, is also flawed in his own ways which adds depth to his character too.  Hardy was obviously better at creating men than women because the women are a little more \\"Victorian stereotypical\\":  the good ones are pictures of chaste virtue who can actually take ill and die over a nasty shock (puh-lease) and the bad ones are fat hags in bawdy houses. The women are certainly less interesting than the men in this book.<br /><br />The plot is nearly impossible to adequately discuss without writing a book of my own.  After the initial unforgivable act, the book fast-forwards 19 years and we soon learn that the previously down-on-his-luck Henchard has made a success of himself in the rural town of Casterbridge, where he is a wealthy merchant and mayor of the town.  At the same time that he takes on a quick and capable apprentice (Farfae), his wife and daughter reappear in his life.  Farfrae proves to be better at Henchard's business than Henchard is, Henchard has to abandon another woman in favor of doing right by his wife and the daughter's paternity is quickly called into question.  Intrigue, twists, turns and surprises ensue.  And all the while, Henchard's selfishness, quick temper and poor-decision making contrive to bring about his eventual fall.  It all makes for a very satisfying read... not as satisfying as say, reading about the Count of Monte Cristo dealing out his brand of justice... but it is interesting to see how things unravel for Henchard nonetheless.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: a very entertaining and complex story from the Victorian era.  Worth a read whether you're plowing through the 1001 Books list or not.<br /><br />This review originally appeared on my blog.  See my profile for details.his life.

B006ON41FC|5.0|Loving this game! It has a large replay value due to the goals/achievements, you level up based on goals and they vary from collect X amount of nuts to go this far with no nut or just good nuts etc, so it's not just endless nut grinding.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|Tried this thing with Windows 7 64-bit on an Acer Aspire.<br /><br />I have had the older version network adapter AWUSO36H from Realtek for 2 years and it works super great.  I thought this newer one would somehow be amazingly super great and get wireless way back in the upstairs back BR. I was wrong.  The NHR picked up the network in my house at half the strength my laptop gets it and picked up none of my neighbors' networks.  The older AWUSO36H picks up my network at greater strength than the laptop alone and it picks up 12 neighbors' networks. I figured out I can live with the older one I already had if I use a 32 foot long powered USB extension cable to get the adapter into just the right spot.  Update to review: I got rid of the powered USB extension and now use a ten-foot RP SMA antenna extension cable to move just the antenna into the proper place and keep the AWUSO36H on the desk. I suggest you do the same - extend the antenna not the entire adapter.  (RP means reverse polarity and SMA means the kind of connector for the antenna.  Reverse polarity means the female threads have the center conductor sticking out.  Normal polarity would be male threads have the center conductor sticking out.  Just know that for wireless antennas, get RP SMA extensions.)<br /><br />I've seen comments that say powered USB cords longer than 32 feet don't work with wifi adapters.  My 32 footer seemed to work except it disconnected if I just wiggled the laptop like it had a defective connector. Now that I know extending the antenna works, it's better because it leaves the adapter safely on the desk and the antenna can go outdoors or wherever no prob.  Read my other reviews to see which antenna extension cable I got.<br /><br />When I wrote in to complain, Amazon said send it back.  I kind of wished they told me they had a bad batch and were going to replace it with a good one.  Oh well.<br /><br />Stick with the older tried and true model.  Thrilled Amazon was quick and easy on thereturn.

Good quality recordings as well.<br /><br />I have seen the film Rocknrolla so many time that when a song comes on I know where in the film it's played. Its wonderful as I love the film. It wonderful when I am on a long drive and need a quick pick-up this CD does the trick. Good buy, would have paid double for it.

1603400265|3.0|I evaluated three series of abridged/paraphrased classics: Great Illustrated Classics, Stepping Stones, and Classic Starts.  I specifically read Treasure Island in all three versions, but also evaluated the Jungle Book and other stories in at least two of the versions.<br /><br />Great Illustrated Classics is in between the others in length and complexity of sentence structures.  It's not as easy to read as Stepping Stones but offers a slightly better story by virtue of more adjectives, adverbs and clauses in the sentence structure.  The language is still more basic than Classic Starts, and the story suffers some because detail is left out that would embellish it.  GIC may be the best series for children readers.<br /><br />Personally, I bought the books intending to read to my kingergarten age children, rather than have them read.  We found the Classic Starts to have by far the best versions of the stories, notwithstanding the originals which are just too long for us, in language that is hard to be understood.<br /><br />So far, with the children, we finished Call of the Wild, are half-way through the Jungle Book, and started Treasure Island.  Previously we've read books like those of Beverly Cleary and the Little House series, besides hundreds of basically picture books (think Virginia Lee Burton, H. A. Rey etc.)  The classics have a little bolder story lines, and these abridged series make them more accessible.<br /><br />Note that the illustrations are poor and don't really add anything.  These are just paraphrased classic stories.  The illustrations in GIC are the least appealing and not any more frequent than those in Classic Starts.  If you want lots of illustrations, try Illustrated Classics (comic book versions).  The stories are very poor, but there's lots of illustrations, none of which are fantastic by comparison to a good imagination with an adaquate telling of the story.<br /><br />I recommend Great Illustrated Classics for the avid chapter book reader.  For stories to be read-aloud, I prefer Classic Starts.Starts.
B005HSL626|3.0|This app is pretty fun. I like the fact that it's free. The only real problem I have with it is that once you unlock everything, it gets kind of boring.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|This album is the perfect blend of african sound and pop music, brought together with the sweet voice of Paul Simon. I picked up this album because the record store I was at did not have Simon & Garfunkel's album \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" (an album I still desire-I have only heard good things), but this album made me happy about my purchase when I played it in my car. Awesome south african choirs and sounds are on every song. This album is one worth buying!  Key tracks: The Boy In The Bubble, Diamonds On The Soles of Her Shoes, You Can Call Me Al, Homeless

Amanda Bynes and Colin Firth are very persuasive. Totally believe their story telling. This is the most adorable lovable watchable dumb movie.

You get some great Lego colors that can be hard to find.<br />Color like: Bright Pink, Dark Pink, Dark Purple, Lime, Magenta and Lavender<br />Plus you get a nice colorful Minifig. I hope to buy a few more of these.<br />Oh don't forget, it comes with the storage container!
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I found a lot of great ideas in this book.  I will have to refer back to it frequently to remember some of the ideas.  Its a short book but not only is it packed with great ideas but the author has a great free website packed with ideas and there is a free audio on his website. I think it would be worth writing down some of the ideas and reviewing them before a social situation.
1569757275|1.0|I would probably have bought this book as novelty if it had had traditional characters.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this game is very fun you can play it all day you would love this game it is more fun than you think
0061969656|5.0|As with every other Bernard Cornwell novel, this is an exciting story bringing historical events alive. This novel continues the story Of Utred began four or five stories before. If you haven't read the previous Saxon Tales, do so, though it is unnecessary to enjoy this tale. For me, it was like catching up with an old friend.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|This is the best CD I own, I listen to it everyday. I know every word and I love it! I have always loved Hugh Laurie, but when he sings, he puts so much love an soul into every song he sings. I didn't think it would be any good, you know another actor with a CD out big deal. It is a big deal. I can't wait for his next album. I am truly a devoted fan and will always be. You must buy and listen. It will change the way you think. If I miss a day and don't listen to this, I am a little sad, but when I listen I am very, very happy. I also have the PBS Great Performances special, so if I don't listen to it I can watch it. Then I am a very happy soul. I love all the songs, but my favorite is \\"Let Them Talk\\" it makes me cry, but in a good way. The way he sings, he truly loves what he is singing!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's s fun games app. Just do not get why people complain about FREE app? If you do not like it, just uninstall! Acctually, I like the challenge to get more points to unlock the next game. Some games are challenging but some are completely boring. So, there are planty enough games for anyone.
1451627289|5.0|As others have given reviews of the plot I will just give my feelings on this book.  This is one terrific time travel.  I love this genre and have read so many good and bad time travel stories.  This does not disappoint.  It is right up there with Time and Again and Replay (my favorites).  The main character is a fabulous person and one cannot help but root for him over and over again.  The book is exciting and unpredictable.  The supporting characters --Al, Sadie, Deke are all wonderful and three dimensional.  The plots are many.  Stephen King manages to keep the tension building throughout the book with many subplots.  Having a love story as another plot just is terrific.  I could have read the book quicker but tried to put it down each day so I could look forward to reading more the next day.  I cannot say enough good things about this book.  It is pure enjoyment!!!!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This is a good game so far and the backgrounds are very good. I like the game play in the quest

0765322889|5.0|This review is for the whole series, not just this book.  No spoilers.  How can you describe a book/series that keeps you riveted... for 7 months???  This series is not for the faint of heart, or low of attention span, or poor of memory.  Erikson dares you to figure out what is going on.  (But he's not going to tell you for a long, long, long time.)  This series requires patience and perseverance.  Crazy things will happen.  You will never be able to predict the outcome.  The universe is overflowing with power, and mortals can acquire godlike abilities.  Tiny little details will come back as critically important.  Hundreds of characters, thousands of pages, a completely unique world.  This could be tedious, except along the way you are following some of the most intriguing fantasy characters you'll ever meet. And some of the funniest. Somehow, even after reading all 10 books, I feel like I did not get enough of them.  Glorious!  I can understand how the blatant lack of exposition irritates people.  And there are certainly things that are never really explained.  I found it enthralling.  I did need to post to a web forum a few times with questions (\\"now who was that guy again?\\") and reassurance (\\"please tell me this entire book wasn't a big waste of time...because right now I'm worried it is\\").  But they got me through, and I'm so glad I did.My only negative comments are that some of the \\"main\\" characters are not pleasant company and tend to wax into a long soliloquoy.  Epic fantasy often suffers from a lack of focus, or \\"filler material\\".  Remember the middle seasons of \\"LOST\\"?  Let me assure you that everything ties together, as crazy as that may seem early on.  The resolution of this series reminded me a lot of how you could tell \\"Harry Potter\\"'s ending had been planned from the start--all those little things along the way made a difference in the end.  The fact that Erikson could weave together so many details over such a monstrous series is tremendous.  He pullsit off, and this is one of my all-time shortlist favorites.  This series is just absolutely fantastic.  But it will take a long, long time to read it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are short and sweet. no game specific instructions though so you'll have to figure out on your own how to play each of them.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|Wish all movies had a good message to the family, but unfortunately out millions we must select the best to keep growing a healthy relationship; and this is one of them.  highly recommended!!

B004VMUS9G|5.0|repeats and uses the same approach as my phone does. could be louder but since kindle does not over heat it can lay under or next to my pillow.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It's a really fun game, looks great and adds a nice twist. I'd say it'd be 3.5 stars for anyone 4 stars for those people who love Mahjong.  I give it 5 for getting it as the FAOTD. Also, for the only reason I made this review. When I downloaded it I noticed several reviews complaining about ads in the game. Sure there is a top row of icons showing other G5 games on the home screen, but it doesn't slow getting into the game, there is a button to start immediately after the developer's logo intro, like every other videogame has at the beginning. To me this is such a pitiful thing to complain about, especially that most of the complainers got it free. Do you people have nothing better to do? Have you noticed the relentless ad placement in games such as madden which is a 60 dollar game when it comes out? Basically, if you like Mahjong, definitely buy it.
014241493X|4.0|This was the first John Green book that I've ever read. I know some people complain that this is too similar to Looking For Alaska, but I've never read Alaska, so I wouldn't know. And because I'm not familiar with Green's work, I had no idea what this book was going to be about. I just cracked open the book and started reading.  The book starts off in a good direction: the first nine chapters are my favorites, with a fast pace and interesting banter between Margo and Q. Once Margo was gone, the mystery surrounding her was good enough to leave me wondering who she really was and what happened to her.  Q is thoughtful and makes observations that are goofy and funny - I laughed out loud more than once - but he's also obsessed with Margo, which I found a little hard to believe. This is a girl who barely acknowledged him for nine years. Why would he suddenly put so much effort into finding her?  The pace is slightly off, too. I wouldn't call it slow, but I wouldn't really say it was fast paced either. There's a lot of stuff happening with Q internally as he tries to figure out the mystery that is Margo and it's not that Q is dull, but there were times where I was tempted to flip through the pages just to get to the end and see what happened.  That's also a good thing, though. I really wanted to know what was going to happen. I had to keep going because I couldn't leave the mystery unsolved.  I don't know how I felt about the ending. It was perfect for the story because I couldn't imagine it ending any other way while still staying true to the characters, but I wish there was more to it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great app. nice the way it plays through.  great job.  i like the additional bonus tile play as well.  graphics are amazing.

However, let me take a minute to say that I believe that the kindle edition, though cheaper than buying the 3 books separately, is annoyingly flawed and basically done without any dedication.  The main flaw is that the font size changes every time I advance one chapter. This is really stupid and I have to readjust it every time. I do not know if other people have had this problem, but it has happened to me in two kindles and in my kindle for android too. This is very annoying and I cannot understand how this can happen in such a popular and well selled book. I believe an update on the file is in order, as has happened with other flawed titles.  The other thing is the format every time you advance from book to book. There are horrible letters that say END OF BOOK XX with a clearly different font and size of the text. It looks pasted and like nobody proof read it.  Also, I would have expected to have the three covers of the books as separation. No such luck. I'd buy the 3 books separately, this is not worth the trouble.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|This movie is the second installment in this franchise. It provides some backstory on what happened in the first movie, which is that the sister's husband places the hex on the girl who kills her boy toy. But only because their is some link to their family history many many years ago. It is well done, but begins to drag at many points. It just seems to work too hard at fitting in with the first movie, which makes it a little bit disjointed overall. In sum, not a bad movie, but not a very good one either.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|It's been almost a month and not a word about this item. I continue to wait only because I don't know where to turn for help.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This was the free game of the day &amp; I wasn't sure it would be any good, but it is.  Very good game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|level up system could use work but I enjoyed it. great for long car rides and entertaing kids for a while
B0060AY6FO|4.0|Readers can have fun imagining Pemberley and its inhabitants six years after the close of &#34;Pride and Predjuce&#34; as long as they don't expect this murder mystery to be a reincarnation of Miss Austen. The novel is a bit slow, at first, but picks up as it nears the conclusion. A worthwhile read, but it is helpful to have a working knowledge of &#34;P & P.&#34;
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great utility. Silmple to install. Works like a charm.  If you need to access your desktop Pc, then this is the app...
B00715SUI6|2.0|What do you get when innovative people chase a buck? Well, this movie is the answer to Here is the last of the series, and we can all thank the sprits for that because it was by far the worst. This one attempts to set up the events that unfolded din the earlier movies, and follows the same formula to get there as well. So, what you have is the same movie (basically), but with the bonus of seeing some 80s fashion. Not my idea of a great movie. So, you can imagine that I was very underwhelmed.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />Hmm, I don't know just what I expected from Mockingjay, but it certainly was more impressive than what I just read!<br /><br />I believed that this finale would be action-packed, thrilling and nail-biting drama all the way until the end, but alas, I must have been mistaking.<br /><br />The beginning was ok, interesting plot development. What wasn't fun (and in fact rather boring) was that middle section of the story where the star team are sent to the Capitol, but not allowed to fight in any real situations, this dragged on for MUCH too long. I didn't feel it held much value, except for padding the story.<br /><br />Another thing that bugged me was the failed relationship with Gale! Yes, he was a bit pig-headed and stubborn, but the way it was left was rather appalling!<br /><br />Peeta, Peeta, Peeta... At first I wanted to punch him in the nuts, then I wanted to give him a set, then he went completely off the rails!! I HATED what Snow did to him. It was cruel and in humane (I get that that was the point), but I didn't find it very believeable.<br /><br />I am not even going to touch Katniss and my thoughts on her incessant crying, bitching and moaning. Grow a freaking brain! Nor am I going to touch the blatantly obvious 'climax' that involved Coin and Snow.<br /><br />Some of the characters I loved were Cinna (my absolute favourite!! Though I was very upset about how he dies and they gloss over it! I mean he was a key supporting character for Katniss throughout the lead up to both games, and to just be glossed over!) Hmmpf!  I also loved Prim. She was such a strong young girl, her character really grew in this last book.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the use of Buttercup in the story, he was fun.<br /><br />Hated the ending! Sorry Suzanne, but Mockingjay only just scraped a 3 star rating, but it wasn't because you can't write beautifully, it was just that this story didn't work for me.
0553801473|5.0|About the book: I knew it was the hardcover edition, but it's some much better than the paperback 'HBO edition' that I was really surprised. The paper cover is beautiful and the drawing in the hardcover (under the paper cover) looks great.<br /><br />About the story: I really missed a lot of characters when I read 'A feast for crows'. I couldn't wait to know something about Daenerys, Jon, Davos or Bran... But the waiting was well worth it :)
B0068TL23G|5.0|I've played my share of puzzle games, but I tend to play more motion-based games.  This more static puzzle game deserves 5 stars for somehow enticing me to keep playing. I thought after the first two pages of puzzles, they would either get boring and repetitive, or too difficult. Now I'm on page six and each challenge seems fresh; after 5 stars, I try the next. It's fun to eliminate impossible paths then find the optimal solution.  (One minor gripe: it should save your best solution so you can keep trying new routes. Though I guess if you've solved a level once, you can solve it again.)  I'm amazed at the number of puzzles and how the authors came up with so many variations and difficulties.  I bet I could create some fun Angry Birds levels if an editor existed; but creating just the right difficulty of Router puzzles seems difficult, so I must give the authors credit.
B004I744AS|5.0|Convient and fun to use. would recommend it to anyone who wants a fast method to look up word definitions.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|Misleading description.  it is just a 5minute trailer of the movie.  they should mention it somewhere.  It is not even a good trailer.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|THis is the first installment in a franchise that was initially novel, but became a bit boring as time went on. Still, this being the first movie, it represents something different and unusual. It is not so terrifying as it is mysterious as a result of how it is shot by the makers. The acting is not bad, and the movie flows well. It is not something not worth watching as a result. What makes it less than perfect is that it is not that scary. Its more interesting, but not scary. That is why I give it only four stars instead o five.
0440244412|5.0|I think that Karen Moning did a fantastic job with this series.  If you like urban fantasy then this is a must.  Thank you Amazon for your fast shipping too!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game that is fun and is more than one game but some games make no sense but most games are fun
B005ONTD42|5.0|OK this thing is awesome. Really cool technology. Everyone I show it to wants to know what it is and where I got it. There are a handful of apps that let you play with it in different ways. Just driving it around is fun, Golf is awesome - but I think the best is yet to come...They have some apps coming out soon where you use the ball like a controller... sort of like a Wii-mote. Can't wait!!!!!! Seems like there will be so many cool apps for an already cool product.  Check out some of their cool videos: [...]<br /><br />Tip: If you get one of these, they are great for pranking and messing with your co-workers or friends...And apparently your pets too (but I don't have one).
0817439390|5.0|I think anyone starting out in photography should read this book first. Bryan lays everything out for you and makes it really simple to learn and the basics of photography.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game on kindle FIRE! Beautiful graphics,  nice music and stable app!  love the adventure feature so you can progress on &quot;quest&quot; !
B004RZGUBM|5.0|I think the reason there haven't been more reviews is a combination of most if not all of these titles can be obtained for free elsewhere, and the comprehensive list makes it mostly self explanatory. That's what this edition has. As someone said, there may have been a large number of grammar errors, as with the free versions, to some extent understandable, but I really don't see much of anything glaring now. What it really boils down to then I think is does the cost make it worthwhile?  For only $3 (currently at least), you get all of his works, small yet visible illustrations, and the one click on the table of contents in a single file makes it all quite convenient. There is also some additional biographies at the end, as well as some commentary by Dickens that is probably difficult to find. If you're a Dickens fanatic, this is undoubtably worthwhile to avoid hunting down the free versions, which in my experience have a plethora of grammar errors and clunky format by comparison.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Mahjong Artifacts is quite fun to play as the puzzles progressively get harder to solve.  also enjoyed the story line.
1469984202|5.0|Just finished reading and wish there was more.  I went to the author's website and understand there is more to come.  Good news, indeed.  Anyone who wants a well-written story that will suck you into a new and frightening world, here it is.  I can see great things for the author.  What a movie these books would make.  Stop reading the reviews and get yourself a copy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading the trilogy after a co-worker mentioned how good the books were. I started reading the Trilogy on a Friday night and was finished in two days. Suzanne Collins kept me wrapped in the story from the very beginning until the end.  Tiffany Berry - Author of Eternal Changes
B006Z7Z3R2|4.0|I absolutely adore Ti West's classic approach to creating real authentic scares without buckets of fake blood and F/X carnage. He takes the time to allow the audience to get to know the characters and actually like them for their cynicism and sarcastic stances on what is happening around them, making them people you can relate to. Perhaps what I love the most about his films, \\"House of the Devil\\" and \\"The Innkeepers\\" is that he films them in areas that appear both foreboding and as classic Americana all in the same frame. The large, isolated Victorian house of \\"Devil\\" and now the historic bed and breakfast Inn at the center of this tale; real places that exist and that add more character dimension than just the actors themselves. To me, his approach while still centered in horror, is more Hitchcock-ian given that the story boils until the final climax, leaving the viewer's tension to grow. \\"The Innkeepers\\" doesn't fail to deliver and while it is some slasher, it is very terrifying in a cerebral context.  My only gripe is that awful cover art that I really hope they don't choose to go with. Originally, there was a far better illustrated poster that was an homage to the old 80's film posters. This new hideous cover art (if we can even call it \\"art\\") reduces the potential market for prospective buyers by making it look like some low-rent direct-to-DVD rubbish that'll be exiled to the $5 Bin at Wal-Mart within a month of release. Does the studio have no honor for film enthusiasts whom actually want a package's authenticity to be intact from A - Z? If not that's tragic, because if I were someone who judged a book by it's cover; I would definitely pass this one on the shelf with cover art like this. Please don't be that person, the movie is great and for those who love classic character driven horror; this one is a keeper!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Without giving anything away, I really recommend this book. I have been recommending it to just about anyone I talk to. It very much suprised me after purchasing it on a whim. Best book I have read in a long time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is so cool and fun so I just can not stop playing it.I love it and you should too!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great game but i dont get the story. Its fragmented and doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Who cares thought its a load of fun to play.
0553801473|5.0|I bought the book the second it was available for my Kindle...before reading the depressing reviews of how terrible the book was.  Imagine my great delight that those reviewers and I completely disagree.  It isn't a terrible book by any stretch of the imagination.  After waiting five long years for the next installment, I was very happy with the \\"bridge\\" concept, and I felt that GRRM didn't disappoint.  His catching us up, moving forward in the inhabitants lives, was done in an incredibly entertaining and expert fashion. After the first chapter, I fell back into the world as if I'd never left, and that's what I consider excellent authorship.  I never felt like it was a book for the sake of publishing something-anything, as I have felt about several other authors who subscribe to the multibook anthologies...\\"uhoh, it's been a while, I guess I better throw something out there.\\"  I savored each chapter, and enjoyed the continued braiding of the creation.  I do hope it isn't another five years.  I, too, want to get on with the story; but this book was a pleasure to read and I felt like it caught me up so I didn't need to go reread the others, although I'm doing that now because they are so well written.
B004XZ99LO|4.0|I like 3D movies and I like documentaries and other various themes. If you like them as well, then I highly recommend this DVD and know that you will not be disappointed. Amazon.com is a wonderful way to expand your 3D DVD collection. I am always impressed with the speed and accuracy of my purchases through Amazon. Try it yourself - you'll love the experience.  NOTE: Some people seem to think the performance is in the nude, however, I did not believe this to be the case here but the costuming is sparse and elaborate. It is an interesting interpretation and performance. Please view it yourself before allowing minors to view it.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|First ten minutes (at least) are long looks and awkward periods of silence.  It's liek they couldn't be bothered to write any dialogue.  the preview makes it look like an action flick but it's not. The end is a bit better but I was happy when the movie finally ended.<br /><br />My friends wanted me to rate the movie a two because Ryan G was in it... :
B0052VUNHC|5.0|... I love this book.. I couldn't seam to put it down.. when I read a book I feel like I'm in there watching it and when i read this it was like I was living it and i just feel everything Addy felt and I thing that's the best kind of book you can read!!

0061969656|5.0|I bought this book for my wife, she's read all the previous editions, if you like British history, this is the book and series for you. So she tells me.  Now she's going to re-read everything again. It's that good.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I was getting bored with the solitaire I was playing and Spider has energized me again with more difficult play and I am really enjoying Spider
B005HP2JAM|2.0|I like 3D movies and I generally like documentaries and other themes, however, I cannot say I particularly enjoyed this movie. This movie is very dry and boring. Perhaps it is just me but I did not find this movie to be very good. Sorry but that's my opinion. Others may find it okay, but I seriously doubt it. My mom always said if you can't say anything nice; don't say anything at all - so pretend I didn't say anything. The seller performed very well and I would buy from this seller again.
B0064J6OMO|3.0|Good romantic comedy flick...not my first choice in movies.  Entertaining, light, not as cheesy as I thought it would be seeing as how this has been done time and again since the 80's.  Interesting twist that made it unique..I won't spoil it (its not earth shattering but I don't like spoilers).
B005T9ZTSU|4.0|I had to download and install this app twice because it kept telling me that it needed to force stop.  Once it was downloaded the second time all was well and I now can upload my pictures with ease.
B003QNXPUK|5.0|Full maximum protection is awesome. Just put it on right the first time and it's perfect. I can see how the \\"orange peel\\" can bother some people but it doesn't bother me - you can only see it of you lock your phone or don't use it. My favorite part about this shield is that its \\"grippy,\\" it won't slide off my work desk compared to PowerSupport. Already dropped my phone inside a night club and it still looks brand new.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great. It has everything you could want or need. It even has reminders! Best Bible app EVER!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Addicted! I can't stop playing this until I finish it. Its pretty fun. I would totally recommend it to anyone.
072325804X|5.0|I absolutely adore this priceless classic children's collection of Beatrix Potter, I purchased this book as a bedtime storybook to read to my three and five year old, who also love these wonderful classic tales. This book is beautifully illustrated, encased in its own special  box. I highly recommend such a storybook to create memories with your children to last a lifetime.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I downloaded this as a back up to the alarm clock that comes standard with my android phone.  I love that it gives you options of when to set it, the language, and many other options.  It is just annoying enough that I do not miss it going off and I am up and out before the 2nd alarm goes off!
B004EPZ06G|4.0|If you the first one you will liked this one. same type of humor. in my opinion the first one is better but if you're looking for a good time with a comedy this is a good movie.
B002LE6XR2|3.0|It is a good product, and the person who i gave it was really happy , but i expected it was made of other material.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are all right but the ads are horrible and I lost all of my games when I updated it
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love to play this game and every time I co e home I play it even wen I'm alone I play it wen I'm sad I play it this game is like my life
0545265355|5.0|I LOVE these books. The story is great, the characters are great, I couldn't put them down. Some people are disappointed by the ending, because it's not a perfect fairy tale, but it's the best ending you could hope for with people who have been through so much.  I have recommended them to everyone. You'll definitely want to have all three because as soon as you finish one, you'll want to start the next.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best app to pass time while I'm at work. there are so many games I never get bored with it!
B006M4F67A|2.0|I have to touch the tiles 5 and 6 times before it will register. This is the ONLY game I have ever had to do that. My touch screen works great on everything. This game is also missing  some options the other one had that were great. They would make this one a lot better. Paid for this app. And wish I hadn't.
B004UBUNDE|5.0|I saw with my daughter yesterday night and it was mind blowing. Adjectives cannot describe the blu ray adequately. watched on a Samsung 46\\" LED connected to a Yamaha speaker set (7:1) with reasonably high volume.<br /><br />The cinematography starts with Hubble launch and its repair mission. It shows the awesome images of hubble's output and with great explanations. Then the second repair mission was nerve racking. My daughter was on her toes during this process. The blu ray movie concludes with several more images of our universe. It is just unbelievable when it ends and makes you wonder and ask lot of philosophical questions regarding existence of life and meaning of life.  The sound effects are also great during Shuttle launches. When guests come over, this is sure to be a conversation piece. I purchased this along with a Hubble National Geographic book.  [[ASIN:1426208944 Hubble: Imaging Space and Time (National Geographic)]]
B005C9YZIM|5.0|The beautiful photography, seamless editing and precise narrative keep people  of all ages riveted to the screen as our earth's secrets unfold before our eyes.  It's a series  that can be visited again and again because the viewer finds something  new that wasn't noticed before.  This is great family material that  can launch discussions about nature and our fit into this fascinating  place we call our home. Superbly done!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Once you play it automaticly opens to feint but other that that its pretty fun and beating the goals is cool too! Getting this game IS worth it:))
B004EBT5CU|5.0|adele music is amazing she is a really great singrr and her songs are amazing<br />I love the way her words come together and what they mean.

0142418218|5.0|My daughter wrote this review for Amazon. I don't see it, hence reposting again.<br /><br />This review is from: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Paperback)<br />I was thrilled by this story because it is funny and has a moral. Charlie is a simple, intelligent, nice and wonderful boy who is rewarded for these things. Being nice and having good behavior is the main moral of this story. Charlie Bucket is the main character in the story. He lived with his parents, Mrs and Mr Bucket and Grandpa Joe and Grandma Josephine, Grandpa George and Gradma Georgina. Although Charlie's family was poor, he was happy with what he had. Charlie's family had a good time as they all lived together. Mr. willy wonka was the greatest inventor and maker of chocolates. willy wonka's factory and Charlie's house were in the same town.Other important characters in the book are Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregard, Mike Teaver and Oompa Loompas.<br /><br />Charlie longed for a chocolate bar which he got only on his birthdays.The book explains and walks through how Charlie was able to eventually own the chocolate factory. Williy Wonka's chocolate factory tour adventure, how Wonka taught lessons to kids who had bad habits are amazing and tense. The poems in between the book are my favorites, especially one about Television. It was great! I also purchased several of other Roald Dalh's book. My other favorite book is Mathilda.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|great game. this game is great for killing time and a good mind teaser. glad i got it free but would purchase it also.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game when u unlock everything and u win after five tries try it out u will like it a lot passes time well also
006117758X|5.0|What I liked about this novel is it's representation of cruel juvenile realism. For children this kind of cruelty seems real. Adults hate you. Your parents hate you. Your peers hate you. You are ugly and stupid. Women don't want you unless you can give them a nice illusion of the future. All these realities are things we all experienced. In childhood you are controlled by your fears. Then your fears become your reality. There is so much drama growing up. Then there is the horrible boredom when you reach adulthood. These trapped feelings leave a sour taste in your mouth. The economy beats you up. The stupid wars beat you up. Your job beats you up. Your family and friends beat you up. OMG! That's what I got from this novel. That feeling of OMG like I had as a kid. Life really is a vile thing when you strip out the hope. But individuals have more control over their happiness than they realize. It seems to take a whole lifetime to figure that out.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|101-in-1 Games is the best app ever! There are so many games in just one app! I would recommend this to every Kindle owner. This is the first game I got on my Kindle and it is the best.
B005K2XM94|5.0|This padded envelope fits the Kindle like a glove and has already paid for itself when I dropped the Kindle.  It is very well padded!

B001O304TO|4.0|Aight!  Well here's a rapidly typed review.  Usually, on successful LP's the hit singles are dispersed throughout the LP.  However, here the four singles are almost the 1st four songs on the disc.  This album may put you in a mid-80s mood or give you a flashback to that era.  You might start thinking about \\"Back to the Future\\" or \\"Family Ties\\" while listening to it.  Now to be honest, back in 2002 or so, PSB released re-mastered version of all their discs and the re-mastered version had more mixes and B-sides.  You might want to get that, rather than this plain-old disc.  \\"2 Divided by 0\\" is prescient in that the duo has been together for decades when naysayers said they'd be a passing trend.  They have used this song in a recent tour almost 20 after the fact.  Their later song/single \\"Yesterday When I Was Mad\\" studied their shocking success.  This disc come out YEARS before PSB came out.  However, even back then I remember \\"Spin\\" magazine writing, \\"Their song 'I Want a Lover' sure sounds like it's from a Rainbow Flag man.\\"  Yes, I totally agree, but I'd add that the conclusive song \\"Why Don't We Live Together\\" can also be interpreted that way.  Like all their discs before they came out, the lyrics aren't included.  However, there are about 50 photos of the pair, including one focused on Chris' butt (the Brits say 'bum'), and hardcore fans will appreciate it.  This is a good darn intro to the band.  You might as well get it if you want to get exposed to the duo if you haven't over the past quarter century.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This series got me back into reading after Harry potter and introduced me to my love of dystopian novels. I finished the series quickly, recommend it to all my friends and even named my cat after the main character, Tally! Unfortunately, the other Scott Westerfeld novels have not drawn me in like this story.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Excellent performing basic GPS receiver for use with computer!  Started up and ran perfectly on four different PCs ranging from an Acer Netbook to a Dell Pentium 4 tower.  Less than 15 seconds cold start to lock on 4+ satellites in my basement.  Works with Delorme Street Atlas, Microsoft MapPoint and Streets & Trips, Precision Mapping, TopoUSA, etc after creating a virtual serial COM port with the included driver.    This device uses the same Prolific serial<-->USB chip as many stand-alone serial<-->USB adapter cables.  Having the current driver is critical, especially with Win 7.  The driver on the included CD is several years out of date.  Go to Prolific's website at    <[...]>    for the latest driver if needed.
B00062PN6I|5.0|the headphones produce great quality sound for under $20. when I  listen to old recordings i can hear multiple instruments that i couldn't hear with beats by Dr. dre. to remove the adapter, you have to unscrew it like a bottle cap.

B005D0RDIE|3.0|I've been a Rush fan since 1976 (yes I'm that old!) and, like everyone, my outlook on life has changed considerably during the intervening years.  Having always been an admirer of their musicianship, song writing and arranging skills, they are the only band/artist that I've kept up with and really listened to consistently. Sure, I still listen on the odd occasion to AC/DC (I mean, that's an exciting sound when the time is right!), but on the whole I've left bands like KISS, Judas Priest, Saxon, and Iron Maiden behind many years ago. So, that's a little background, now on to this DVD...  Rush very rarely put together new collections of material these days. There is the forthcoming album \\"Clockwork Angels\\" to come, but I'll get to that a little later (albeit in a short form as it's not due out until May apparently).  They have toured a lot in recent years though. \\"Vapor Trails,\\" \\"R30,\\" \\"Snakes & Arrows,\\" and now \\"Time Machine\\" were all very successful jaunts and Rush have become one of the hardest working bands around and fair play to them for that. They are taking their music to the masses like never before and are experiencing a renaissance as a result. Good for them.  I don't have a problem with the amount of DVDs they put out either. I think it's great that fans who couldn't make the concerts have a chance to see the show, even though it's through camera lenses. After all, to get to see the gig you missed over and over is a great trade-off for just under $20, right? Of course it is.  What I have a problem with is the attitude coming from the band these days. \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" was musically one of their best ever. Producer Nick Raskulinecz had Rush playing how most Rush fans had been yearning for them to play for years. It was a nod to \\"Hemispheres\\" (that chord!!), \\"Permanent Waves\\" (the end of \\"Far Cry\\" continues, for me at least, to remind me of the ending of \\"Jacob's Ladder\\") and almost made it to the heights of \\"Moving Pictures.\\"  Almost.  Lyrically, it was pretty angry, but not pretty. Neil Peart's lyrics have often come in for a bashing over the years. \\"2112\\" was called \\"crypto-facist\\" by a moron at the NME, and have been called various unsavoury names by countless journalists who have long since embraced obscurity. Rush have kept on rolling unabated as has Peart.  The lyrics on \\"S&A\\" were a vicious broadside at religion (but mainly Christianity). Peart has become an acolyte of British, and long since discredited anti-intellectual atheist bigot Richard Dawkins, (and I say discredited because someone who peddles hatred like that immediately loses any argument they may have had - and millions of atheists are completely embarrassed by his vile nonsense). Even the new album, by all accounts, is lyrically along the same kind of lines.  So, it's a shocking development, that Peart has \\"come out,\\" as it were, in such a nasty way (on his blog he even mentions the pathetic \\"skygod\\" epithet...never thought he was a childish name-caller, but there you go). He always seemed like such a reasonable man, willing to take all things into consideration and give space to things he didn't agree with. That is obviously not the case, that's if it ever was at all.  But, finally, on to this DVD. On the special feature section there is another particularly telling moment of how ugly Peart has become in his elitism and crushing dislike of all things he doesn't agree with or like.  During a humourous intro video (Gershon's Haus of Sausage looks like a must-visit to me!), part of the script stood out as nothing more than a childish aside by Peart. During various versions of \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" (including a a pretty groovy 70s disco version), there is a country version. Geddy Lee's character rolls his eyes, but after \\"Rash\\" (the pretend house band in the video intro) finishes that version, Peart utters the sentence \\"music for morons.\\" Unfortunately, this is typical of Neil Peart these days. He has fast become a man that dismisses entire swathes ofpopulations as \\"morons\\" or \\"stupid\\" because they believe in certain things or listen to certain music.  Over the years, I have listened to country music and enjoyed some of it. I listen a lot to Alison Krauss & Union Station, Faith Hill, and many others. So, the questions begged Neil are: Am I a moron? Is everyone that listens to country morons?  There is a nasty elitism that Peart is infected with. He obviously feels, as does the rest of the band (or they wouldn't allow these lyrics and attitude to stand), that anyone who doesn't buy into their belief system is a \\"moron.\\" It's inarguable as it's right there in front of us, in colour, front and centre and it's big time ugly and bigoted (and I feel so sad about it, but it can no longer be denied or ignored).  The performances on this DVD are fine, but not spectacular, efficiency personified. Yes, I know, I've left it long enough to talk about the performances (great to see \\"The Camera Eye\\" performed again after so many years, and it's a stand-out for sure), but certain things needed to be said, so I said them.  As for the next CD, I'll have to hear it before buying it (and that's never happened to me before with Rush). Quite frankly, however, I'm sick of being insulted for my beliefs, as well as my likes and dislikes because they don't line up with Neil Peart's or the rest of the band.  I'm probably going to get hammered by the Rush Patrol for this (\\"don't feed the troll,\\" \\"you don't have to buy Rush products\\" yada yada), but I expect nothing less. Or maybe I should say, I expect nothing more.  Some of you will disagree with me vehemently, and I support your right to do so. Some of you may even agree with me, but you will be few and far between. I'm off to listen to Alison Krauss now, as a fully paid-up, card-carrying member of the \\"Moron Club\\" should. Bye y'all!
0553582038|5.0|Hello everyone! This is a review of [A FEAST FOR CROWS] by [GEORGE MARTIN]. I really, really, REALLY loved this book, take my word for it! It is one of the best books that [GEORGE MARTIN] has ever written. On the cover of [FEAST FOR CROWS] there is a [RED BIRD] that will really stick in your mind after you see it, urging you to buy it. And you will! Because [A BEAST FOR CROWNS] is a really, really [REALLY] good book! The book is written in very clear blank ink and crisp, readable font that will make you stare at the words for [HOURS]. You will also want to glide your fingers across the pages, feel the smoothness of the paper and never have to look at the words because this book is perfect and very well made. The book has [8900] pages and I have read all these pages [BACKWARDS] and [BACKWARDS], take my word for it. The book was published by [BATMAN] and I have [ZERO 0] complained to the quality of this publishing, so feel free to send lots and of money, preferably in [AMERICAN DOLLARS]. The story flows really well and will leave you [BREASTLESS] from beginning to end. I still remember the time the main character [EDWARD STARK] [KILLED THE BAD GAY] and it stood out as the most memorable scene I ever remembered. It was very [INSERT APPROPRIATE ADJECTIVE] SAD]. Also when [DANYRIS TORGORON] [WENT INTO THE DEATH STAR AND STEALED THE RING] it was quite a shock! [ROCKY MARTIN] will always stand out as a really, really, REALLY good author for writing those scenes, that I have just written because I have read this very, very, VERY GOOD [BOOK] BOOK! [THE FEET OF CLOWNS] is one of the [SUPER]greatest books I have ever read and you should buy it! [IF THE BOOK IS A PART OF A SERIES, INCLUDE THE SUCCEEDING INFORMATION, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO DELETE THI] BUYER DISCRETION IS ADVISED! If you have not read the other books in this wonderful series, please buy them now! They are [A GAME OF TONES], [A CHAMBER OF SECRETIONS], [A RETURN OF A KING], [INFINITE JOINT] and [SEX FOR DUMMIES]. These are also my favorite books and you must buy them or I will be very, very, VERY [ADJEC---SMASHED!!].
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a really fun game but it is hard to get other games and some of the games are hard but seriously I cannot believe some people gave it one star or 2 stars!  I think you should get it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great app. It is very addicting. You should buy it. I could play for hours and hours and hours and never get bored one bit. Like I said in the title for this reveiw, this app is totally awesome!!!
0440422973|5.0|This was a great read!  Highly recommend it to anyone who struggles with the Christmas and the chaos, fights, craziness that goes with what is supposed to be a wonderful winter wonderland holiday.  I laughed out loud, groaned a few times as I saw myself and was just plain entertained.  You can read it in an evening or a 2 hour flight, easy to follow, great characters.  Enjoy!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just downloaded this game to the Kindle Fire and have no problems - would recommend HIGHLY!!! not disappointed at all.
B005Q1W0ZQ|2.0|What bad melodrama lol...................season one was decent soap opera; season 2 was just bad.  The last ten minutes of the Christmas episode saved it from total failure.  In this type of show the quality of the villians determine the quality of the story.............Thomas and Miss O'Brien are pretty boring cliched characters.  While on the subject of villians, why is no there no nasty femme fatale amongst the ladies on the upper floors?  Waugh and Ford made great use of this and DA suffers from the lack of one.  Poor Bates....what did he do to suffer Job like travails from the writers?.....I admired him in season one; in season 2 it has just been overkill to see how many ridiculous plot contrivances can be put on his head.  Did the writers change his sentence to life in prison so he can de beaten up for another entire season??  It looks like it.  The \\"lost heir\\" was a total loser................why even bother if you are are not going to make him a serious and attractive alternative to Matthew?  I know I am in the minority.................If if you can watch it for free, go for it..............I feel I wasted money buying the season 2 blu-ray.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I'll admit, I was first turned onto this band when I heard \\"We Are Young\\" a while back. But that song seems to be just the top of the iceberg. This album begins with an absolutely amazing 4 song run (counting the intro). Sadly, the run has to end. \\"It Gets Better\\" is certainly one of the weaker songs on the album, although I can say it has grown on me a bit since my first listen. Perhaps, as they say, it does get better. The second half might not be as energetic or exciting, but it's certainly just as strong. \\"Why Am I the One\\" and it's follow up \\"All Alone\\" are both equally great, but become one incredible song when played back-to-back.  Strongest songs: \\"Some Nights\\", \\"We Are Young\\", \\"Why Am I the One\\", \\"Carry On\\", \\"Stars\\"  Weakest songs: \\"It Gets Better\\", \\"All Alright\\"  Overall, this is a great album. Certainly one of the best so far this year. I look forward to listening to it many times over.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|This is a great Cd.  I ordered it used and when it came in the mail I couldn't even tell. No scratches on the disc nor the case. The Cd arrived at my house 4 days after I ordered it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|How can a movie be fantastic and inspiring? Check out Courageous. From the producers of Fireproof ( a must-see for couples, if not everyone) this is a movie for the whole family. It has a lesson for all ages and the teens were spellbound. It is good, clean family entertainment and makes you think for a long time afterward. Everyone should have a copy of this on their entertainment center. And every time I see it, I notice something I missed before. There should be a 6-star rating for movies like this!
B004EC5IUW|5.0|i bought this on a whim and was quite impressed. the quality is really good and this is just an amazing anime to begin with
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the App. Would be nice if u could access more features offline. But overall I would recommend this app to others.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I'm very happy with this app for keeping up with my e-mail on my Kindle Fire.  It displays everything neatly and it's easy to scroll through, read, delete e-mails, etc.  There's not a whole lot else to say about it beyond that.
0307959856|1.0|I read the whole thing, although I found it unpleasant. Ms. James really shouldn't have done this. There is WAY too much repetition and reiterating the plot of Pride and Prejudice. (Hey, I KNOW the plot. Very well. Knock it off. So annoying.)  Her treatment of Elizabeth and Darcy are abominable. Even if she hadn't been violating Jane Austen, this still wouldn't have been a good book.  All this book is good for is to demonstrate what a genius Jane Austen was and that P.D. James is not. The way to riff on a classic is best shown by the book Jack Maggs: Take a SUPPORTING or minor character and run with that. The only bit of the book that has some merit is the bit that includes Elizabeth's father Mr. Bennet. Maybe P.D. James could have had Elizabeth's father solving a murder mystery in which Charlotte's family (and the hilarious Mr. Collins)  had some peripheral part. I know this: She should have stayed far, far away from Pemberley, Elizabeth, Darcy, Wickham (although I did like her making Wickham having had some success as a soldier) and Lydia.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|started out having issues on how and what the app does but it's getting easier each time<br />so don't feel dumb if u don't get it right from the start
B003TEO3EI|5.0|IMHO, this CD is great. I don't know if people who like Blind Guardian in their beginning phase would enjoy it so much, so I recommend you to do the same as I did: listen to a sample of each song before deciding to buying it. I'm not a expert in heavy metal nor power metal. I just like the power and the melody of the songs. The strong voice, the images/feelings that the songs bring me, the guitar solos, the many voices à la \\"Queen\\" style. The lyrics. If you're new to Blind Guardian and you like Metallica, Iron Maiden and Queen, you should give Blind a chance...  ps: the 2nd CD doesn't add much more songs, but different versions of the same songs. So consider that you're buying a single CD that come with extra material.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This was the best game ever I can not stop playing this game. I just can't put it down this game is awesome if you want to get this game you should it is tough but fun.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|fun,easy to learn, graphics are very nice, great free app of the day, works well on my Fire, I've quickly deleted some of the other free games but I think this is a keeper.
B000JQUZCI|4.0|I wanted to read much of the free books with my new kindle and I started with this edition of Frankenstein. It was a slow start to a book which I imagined would be amazing based on its popularity. It took me over a month to get through it because of the less suspenseful moments. I started two other books before finishing this one. However when the book picked up it was a great read. Also confusing at time to who was speaking and the dialect made me review much of what I had already read.<br /><br />This edition was free and I love free books.In reading this book you must remember it is taking place over 200 years ago and the dialect is far superior to most writings of today, so some dictionary searches may be necessary. Even though it was not as good of a read as I expected I would still recommend it to anyone who wants to read the classics.
0061703087|4.0|Enjoyable.  The plot to begin with had captivated me, but let it be said that the plot was what kept this book afloat.  I liked Jack as the main character, but many of the other characters were a little 2 dimensional. Besides Mae and Ricky, I felt no real compassion for the other characters. But the story about dangerous nano particles was interesting.  Let it be said that this is no Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park, or Timeline. It does captivate, but it is not his finest of works, but it is a lot better than most authors.  Enjoy!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I originally bought the product because of its advertised ability to be folded into a stand. That part doesn't work very well. It does fold and stand, but it doesn't take much for it to collapse, as it's only an edge of the case inserted into a narrow groove that is holding it together. If that groove was deeper and/or there was a way to secure it, it would be perfect. But, since I wanted it mainly for use while lying in bed, I have found that the strap that is attached to it (that holds the case shut) is actually a very good 'holder'. I can insert my hand thru the strap..... and the Fire is securely attached to my hand.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun game lots of variety at different skill levels my boyfriend and I are taking turns trying to beat eschothers scores
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As you can tell by the reviews and popularity of the book it is a fine read. I read it in 3 days, two of which I worked 12 hr shifts. It is very entertaining and fast paced, you fall in love with many characters even the ones you wish you didn't. I often reminded myself that I was reading a book about children thrown into an environment in which  the \\"kill or be killed\\" reigned supreme. It made me think that maybe current culture is not too far from the premise, I hope I am wrong but it is fathomable. It was at times predictive, but still a great read.
0393327345|5.0|Chucks first book, but arguably his best. Fight Club is entertaining and will keep you reading for many hours. Its around 200 pages, nothing to long, but at the amount to keep you very satisfied. This book is the entree to my reading.  Enjoy!
0440243688|2.0|WOW! I am on chapter 59 and if I have to read through one more detail about the layout of NYC my head will explode! I thought about starting the Reacher novels because they rank so high on the best seller lists. I actually found this one at a resort and started reading it. It started out great and even though I had no background of Jack Reacher it was a great read. But now it seems like it is just someone showing off their detailed knowledge of NYC. Maybe if I was from there I could relate. But as far as it being any relevance to the novel if you have no clue what he is talking about, it's just filler. Like Child needed to turn in X-amount of pages by Sunday so he gave a tour of NYC. Someone tell me is this how all of his Reacher novels are? If so, I won't waste anymore time reading them.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|When I initially heard this CD I was thrown off a bit by the usage of autotune. But it's not like Ke$ha or something where it's used throughout the whole album. It's used at appropriate times.  This CD is a masterpiece and I've never been more proud of these boys and more proud to know Jack Antonoff. It's totally different from their first album \\"Aim and Ignite,\\" but it's a great kind of different. It's so fun to dance to or just to go walking to with it pounding through your headphones. It's just so beautiful. Nate's voice is still as perfect as it was before. Go buy this CD, you'll regret it if you don't.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|i am stuck on the part with the box that u dig up. i know ur supposed to use the code that u get from the golden snake puzzle but it wont work because the directions are too vague. and trust me, the first thing I do when stuck is NOT ask for help, but this is not working!! someone please help me!! I don't mind spoilers.
B006ZBRMOU|1.0|I started out reading the first book, FFG, and loved it and therefore couldnt wait to read the second one, FFD, which i ended up liking too...then I got to this last book in the series and i realized I was reading more of the same...nothing had changed!!I found myself just skimming through the pages and could barely finish it. The storylines lacked depth and whatever conflict came up between them was dull and quickly resolved then it was back to more BDSM!! Ana was still describing how hot she found Christian and how 'those jeans hang on his hips in that way' and how his sensual looks made her feel things all the way south of her navel'! I mean really??...we get it..he is hot! We dont need him described to us in every chapter very much the same way in that he was described in Books 1 and 2. Phrases and words like, dont bite your lip, mercurial, did you eat, plum dress (lol)....are a recurring theme in all three books, and after a while they start becoming annoying. Ana tries to stand her ground when Christian is being too pushy/stalker/psycho, but when he gives her that intense look or wicked smile..she melts and all is forgotten and succumbs to 'my fifty shades'!! Oh..and lets not forget Christian's constant mood changes which would give anyone whiplash..he was cold one minute then hot the next...(aaah, that explains the word mercurial being used over and over @_@) and it got tedious reading about his juvenille temper tantrums. I doubt a marriage like that would stand the test of time, especially if your wife is frightened of you half the time!! All i can say is EL should have ended the series with the second book!
B00139XSBA|2.0|Actually, I haven't read the Kindle version and thanks to the people who explained about all the mistakes, I'm not going to!  I have it in paperback and it's a great book, so Amazon: please fix these mistakes!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think you should get it right now   I'm not nodding.  it is free and I really think fabina really should get back together.
