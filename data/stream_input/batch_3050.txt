B0094BB4TW|5.0|I guess I use this app more than the other app that I got.  Guess I don't know why I got the both but I probably will need the other one also down the road some.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Let me start by saying I am not the target audience for this book. I am a 24 yr old teacher, who just enjoys YA books. It started with the Hunger Games and then followed by Delirium, Matched, The Uglies, etc. Most of this trilogies have the same flaw, a weak third book and a bittersweet ending... sadly Divergent is not an exception. After reading the reviews, I went ahead and read the last chapter and epilogue. I knew what was going to happen, but still took my time and read the book. It wasn't what I expected, and it is far from being as good as the other two, but I still enjoyed it. If you liked the first two, give this one a try, even if its just to choose for yourself if you like it or not.<br /><br />(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br /><br />Allegiant It didn't grab my attention as the other two did, but still it has some good aspects. I liked exploring what life was outside the fence, it made me think a lot and imagine if he could actually get to such a point as a race. I also enjoyed seeing Tris and Tobias explore their relationship as the teenagers they are and love each other and see past their flaws and insecurities. I liked how some of the other characters where developed and seeing them move on with their lives in spite of everything that happened. I missed seeing and learning about the factions, and the different POV's where a little confusing, but I guess that was the point.. seeing how their whole life changed overnight. The book does seem repetitive (another rebellion, another dangerous mission) and  there were a few blah moments where I just skimmed through. But overall I don't regret reading it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have used this quite a bit.  We loose our power quite often when it gets extra windy and I have used this to wake me up to get one grandson up for work and then one up for school. I like it alot.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing graphics made this game superb. This is adventures as well as incredible one. I love this game so much
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the best game like this. I love the fact that there are 4 different locations to choose from ADDICTING!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I saw the third season of the series and I thought it was amazing- the book is so much better in every way, I loved it, had to read it every spare moment I had.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|You have to have a Facebook account if you want to get past level 35,this is a really fun good game.I love it.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I loved this movie along with the kids. I have already preordered Despicable2. Can't wait. Got pack for the short minion movies also.<br />I have watched this 3 or 4 times already and still have to laugh out load.
B00C5XBAOA|5.0|cute, with very good finishing and durable material can be lasting, are equal to the real characters and buy the antencion was fast and excellent
0756655307|5.0|This product came very quickly and is has everything I wanted in an awesome encyclopedia!! There really are no characters that are left out. Makes a great gift.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun! it is sooooo addicting and creative. all the people who HATE this game can go SLAP THERSELVES!
0345529057|5.0|I bought these for my husband to save money rather than going and buying a single book at a time. They are brand new and exactly what you expect to be getting. They shipped and delivered quickly and packaging was good as well. I would recommend this set if you are wanting these four books.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was concerned after reading all the negative reviews that I wouldn't enjoy this book.  On top of that, it was dissappointing that so many reviewers felt it was their duty to spoil the ending for everyone.  I thought the book provided an excellent finish to the series.  I doubt there could have been a better ending, not like a bunch of trilogies that just fizzle out without closure.  I honestly do not understand why so many people are upset with how it ends, there was a good moral lesson in the conclusion and it reminded us life doesn't always turn out the way we would like.  I'm looking forward to reading Veronica's next endeavor. For those undecided whether to read this book or not, don't be fooled by the negative reviews, it is an excellent conclusion to a great series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game candy crush saga is very addictive I play both candy crush and candy crush saga and I always find my self  playing both all the time early in the morning and late at night
B000R8YC18|5.0|*insert gunshot sound*<br />Anyway, I will NEVER regret purchasing this collector's edition of Taxi Driver. Never, ever. It was neatly packed and shipped quickly. The movie arrived in perfect condition. I could say nothing bad about my experience. And the movie itself, whoa. What a gem. What a great film. What a CAST! Personally, I feel that Harvey Keitel was one of the greatest highlights of the movie. But again, that's just me.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was so well done! An amazing piece. It really made me think about my life and the lives of everyone around me. It also made me think about the unimaginable pain people with cancer have to go through. I haven't cried so hard in ages! I now have a completely new perspective on my life and how it should be lived.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|There's not a lot else to say about this film that hasn't yet been said I imagine; but, hey ho!  Scott interpreted Dick's dystopian view of the future to produce, what at the time of first release, in 1982, must have seemed an astonishing view of what life might look like in 2019.  Now we are only a few years away it's hard to decide how accurate that vision was.  The action is set in the Los Angeles of the time and it rains a lot; so, from a meteorological viewpoint, I guess not very accurate!  Scott's 2019 L.A. looks a bit more like I might imagine a future New York to look or, perhaps, Chicago which, in some respects, it almost does.  But wherever, it still looks amazing visually echoing as it does the look of Fritz Lang's seminal `Metropolis': in terms of production design, Len Wiseman's Philip K. Dick adaptation, Total Recall, released only in 2012, seems hardly to have moved anything on.<br /><br />The casting is near perfect: M. Emmet Walsh brings a noirish feel to sleazy police captain Bryant and even though, incredibly, the film's screenwriter, Hampton Fancher, is reputed to have `seen' a 75 year old Robert Mitchum in the lead role, Harrison Ford is a perfect fit and gives a suitably laconic `Mitchum-like' performance as world weary cop Dekard.  Rutger Hauer as the ultra-violent but oddly sympathetic super Nexus-6 Replicant `boss' Roy Batty, also, seemed perfect casting and the beautiful Sean Young (whatever happened to her?) captures the insecurity and fragility of the `is she or isn't she a' Replicant, Rachael.<br /><br />Strange to think that a film which in 1982 didn't go down to well with the film going public is now commonly and quite rightly regarded as a cinematic masterpiece.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|If everyone could read this book, there would be no hate on the world.  I just can't handle this book.
B00002ZMNV|4.0|Not as many songs as we thought.  Love the music w/the symphony orchestra though. Nice to listen while cooking dinner.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like the progressive difficulty of this game. I also appreciate that it keeps your place as I publicist occasionally.  This is one of the better apps
B000JMKNVK|5.0|This is one of Lehane's best Kenzie and Gennaro books. Excellent plot, continuous action and a truly evil villain. The writing seems to have &#34;petered-out&#34; with the most recent addition to this series, but Lehane is in top form in this book.
B005CKPQNE|4.0|I never saw this before, then watched the AMC marathon and what I missed in the middle of the night rented the rest, pretty much saw all of the episodes in a week.  But by the end I was enjoying things much less, skipping too even as I paid per episode -- and paying per anything makes for a different experience than getting the programs &#34;free&#34; on cable as you are charged anyways.  But The melodramtic plot lines and sheer neverending screaming wears, the show captivates by over-the-top melodramatics and wears for the same reason, however there are moments of quiet.  It's kind of The Walking Dead theory of programming.  In any case, almost all the characters started to seem not shabby and corrupt and less likable -- and I was watching things out of sequence anyways at times -- but just tiresome.  That being said, I can not watch 50 minutes of most TV much less 50 hours, so this was very good relatively.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its great.  I was able to synch it up with my facebook version and can now play it anywhere on the same level.  Even better, it was free.
B005URBC6Y|1.0|Note the Kindle version is not the same as the paper edition.<br />The paper editions highlights the more complex words and<br />gives definitions on the opposite page. The Kindle version<br />just BOLDs the complex words. You can still right-click any<br />word to get the normal Kindle dictionary definition of the bold word<br />(or even not bolded word), but this is not the definition<br />displayed in the print edition of the book.<br />The Kindle version does not contain the glossary of all<br />the bolded words as the print edition does.<br />Do not waste $1.99 on the Kindle edition of Kaplan's version<br />of Jekyll and Hyde. You can get the book free from<br />Google Books, although it won't have the complex words bolded.
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|The charger works well, and is nearly the exact size of my Samsung s3, just a little thicker.<br /><br />My only minor complaint is that I  need to remove my phone case to get the large plug into the phone. I expect the larger piece makes the product more durable, so that's okay with me.<br />:-)
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The book was amazing and I couldn't keep my eyes away from it! It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, can't wait to read the next book
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|This movie tells a very real story of a family who actually survived a traumatic, devastating tsunami against all odds of surviving, and their story of how they came together. This movie shows almost all aspects of the human heart and how humans can come together in the darkest hours and comfort each other. I appreciate the film and what it taught me and I know it can teach you too.
1592402038|5.0|How this lady makes punctuation so interesting is amazing to me.  She confirmed most of what I already knew and it is so nice to know that I am not the only &#34;stickler&#34; in the world.  Like her, I am also regularly tempted to rub out those superfluous apostrophes on chalk boards outside shops and restaurants, and sometimes I surreptitiously do!
B00BT70J6S|5.0|Despite some initial misgivings about the technical quality of such old recordings, before purchasing,  I can whole heartedly recommend this set even after listening to only the first few cds.<br /><br />The artistry and sheer magic of the performances is overwhelming and far outweighs any audio shortcomings.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this has got to be one of the most adictive and amazing games ive ever played. im so glad they finnaly have a kindle version.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|Lots of bits and seam to be the right sizes but the case is flimsy plastic. Not a big problem, but I'm not sure how long it will last opening and closing.<br /><br />Overall I like it.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I want to separate my enjoyment of the story from the actual quality. I will say in the end I was glad I hadn't felt really connected to the characters. Reading it I thought the writing was fine. I am normally a devourer when I read, not putting a book down until I'm done. I was able to put this book down. I'm not sure what that says about the book. My students who read it were not pleased and are very sorry for the investment of time spent reading and waiting. I believe one comment from one student was \\"I waited a year for this?\\" There were a few other comments but we are all trying to keep the talk to a minimum until everyone who is currently reading can get through it.
B006LR0XLM|4.0|The Dropbox APP allowed me to share large video files from my Droid that I have otherwise been unable to share.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad Candy Crush is now available on my Kindle Fire HD!!! I have been waiting for it for so long!!! The best game ever!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a great game for the whole family! Kids love to play it, they get to pet horses and learn how to take care of them. Big kids like mom gets hook on it too! =)
0525478817|5.0|This book is probably the best book I have ever read. It has a good story about life and love. The story was entertaining through the whole thing. I would reccomend this book to anyone. All ages should read this book, it teaches that even in our hardest times, a good friend will help you through it all. 5 stars.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant follows in the same tone and style as the previous books in the Divergent series.  If you enjoyed Divergent and Insurgent, I think the only reason you wouldn’t like Allegiant is because you feel entitled to have an ending that you find perfect instead of what the writer deems appropriate.  I actually enjoyed Allegiant more than Insurgent because there was less annoying teenager drama between Tris and Tobias and more information on the world in which they live.  Everything is explained in Allegiant (at times it is a little heavy on the exposition, but Roth handles this pretty well), and I personally think the ending was perfect.  Roth makes a statement about humanity and the character of people, and it’s really a positive, happy ending in that way, even though the plot isn’t your traditional happy, unrealistic ending.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Love playing this game daily if I was to influence anyone to get this game I highly recommend you download this game asap
B001E75QH0|4.0|Two of these movies (Raiders of the Lost Ark & The Last Crusade) are our favorites. Temple of Doom leaves us cold. I bought the whole collection for its  historical value.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved Divergent, Insurgent was okay, this book was terrible.<br />And I didn't know the ending until I came here to review the book.<br />I could swear this was written by a different author than the first book. It was hard to keep reading it, daytime tv was keeping me more interested than the book was. I couldn't put the first book down until I finished it.<br />I'm glad I didn't finish it, seems like I would've been disappointed until the end.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I really don't like to review music as it's such a subjective thing.  If you like sort of folksy type stuff, you might wanna give this a listen.  I know you have already heard &#34;Home&#34; since it's on every other commercial on TV....
B002GHIPYI|4.0|Sturdy and reliable headphones. The noise canceling feature is less than I expected, but not bad at all. My only real complaint is that the cord is far too long for daily, practical use.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This app is easy to use and can tell you quite a bit about area weather.<br />I recommend this app.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Not as functional as Apple TV or Roku.  Disappointed with the way it integrates with the sound system for my television.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is addicting and can be very frustrating, but I love it anyway!!  There's a bit of strategy involved so it isn't as similar to other games as I originally  thought.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There are already thousands of reviews written... a movie is about to be made... the book is already a best seller...<br />I saved myself a few $ by borrowing the kindle version from the library.  I'd have gladly bought the book from amazon though without regrets.  This book is intense.  There are soooo many sex scenes.  It's like BDSM 101 when Ana was introduced to the playroom.  I liked the way this author came across as one smart individual.  The word choices, the terminology regarding flying the helicopter, gliding, sailing... all very accurate sounding.<br />I hate Mrs. Robinson!<br />I'd recommend This Man (trilogy) if you enjoyed FSOG.
B00FIYGYKS|4.0|It's trivium through and through, but David draiman's influence is a little to prominent in my opinion. The bonus tracks are worth the extra money.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 2 kept me up most of the night reading until I couldn't keep my eyes open any more.  Things happen really fast for these two people who supposedly have only been together for maybe a month or so?<br />I still hate Mrs. Robinson!<br />At the end of this book, readers are thrown some crumbs as to where the story will venture into.  Looks like there will be suspense?  Perhaps some action?  No wonder they are making a movie out of these books.
006202406X|5.0|Instead of not reading this book because of other people's reviews, read it and decide for yourself :-) Just because a book doesn't end the way some people want it to, doesn't make it bad book!  This is the author's story and I for one am happy that she didn't take the easy way out with a fluffy ending.  It's a Dystopian society, things don't always end with rainbows and unicorns.  Have tissues ready near the end and enjoy the story.  Great job to Veronica Roth for sticking to her story even though I'm sure she knew some people wouldn't be happy with parts it.  Can't wait to see what she writes next.
B00454U1NS|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this is a great cd.<br />Pink is a great singer.<br />I recommed this to anyone.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It's clears out junk files, boosts your memory and can uninstall apps (kindle fire HD) so far I really like it, simple design and easy to use I have no complaints
B005HPY8LU|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this is a great cd.<br />Kelly Clarkson is a great singer.<br />I recommed this to anyone.
B0007TKNII|5.0|After seeing the production of Phantom on Broadway, I wanted to see the movie to compare. It definitely filled in some things I missed in the play.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so excited about Candy Crush on Kindle. I love this game! So much fun &amp; addictive. Beware once you start it's hard to stop.
B00007KWHG|5.0|This CD hits most of the top hits and is a great sing along whether you're driving in the car or just hanging out!
B004HD61KE|5.0|First book I've read by this author was entertaining and kept my interest, will read more books by James  Rollins
B00FOWX6NM|3.0|I love these cases with the clear back for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S.  I had been using a black Ringke Fusion from Rearth for my black/slate iPhone 5.  That case is excellent.  Similar to this one but the bumper is designed a little differently.  When I ordered my white/silver iPhone 5S I wanted to order the gray Ringke Fusion for it, but it was not yet available.  I found this instead and decided to give it a shot.  When I received the case I really liked the design.  I actually liked it a little better than the Ringke case.  I only hoped that the clear plastic rear of the case would hold up as good as the Ringke did.  That case is nearly impossible to scratch.  Unfortunately, this case does not hold up nearly as well.  And yes I did remove the protective films before I used it.  This back of this case scratches so easily.  And I am very careful with my phones.  They stay in one pocket alone with nothing else to scratch them.  The Ringke Fusion only has a few barely visible scratches after months of use.  This case was full of scratches and marks within the first week.  I now have all three colors of the Ringke Fusion and they hold up extremely well.  I really wish the Spigen was as durable, because I really like the design and feel of it better.  But with the scratched back, it ended up looking like junk.  I wish Spigen would use the same plastic that Ringke uses.  That would make this case #1 and it would probably be the only case I use.  I even went as far as trying to remove the plastic back to replace it with one from the Ringke cases, but it was impossible to do without ruining the bumper.<br /><br />The case did ship with 3 of Spigen's clear screen protectors.  I would say for the price of this case, that was worth it alone.  Their screen protectors are the best I've ever used and I would order another case just for the screen protectors.  They're actually cheaper with the case.  If only the quality of this case was up to par with their screen protectors, they would dominate the \\"clear back\\" case.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|best game ever. love me some candy crush saga. got my family playing it too. so glad its finally available on kindle
B008DYZKQE|5.0|I love this book and the importance of personality and character it teaches. Good to start your daughters out young!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, a Kindle versiont!!  Only problem is that you start back at 1 but it's amazing how fast you zip through the early ones.  Really enjoy it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game as it keeps my mind active & that I can now<br />Play on my kindle fire
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is great and should always be considered in this series do not skip the great series of books
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great little game, love the mini games in with it and how easy it is to collect money, imitates the movie well
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|The movie was entertaining but not a blockbuster. It was a good for the family type movie with not a lot of blood and guts.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|The item shipped to me looks very different from the ad. It has a lot of obvious scratch on the back.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG!  Finally Amazon got it and got the  real candy crush before it was not fun anymore. This is a wonderful time consuming game everyone should try it.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I chose Lexington,ky public dictionary because it can help many children in life. Just now my brother had a word to find the meaning of , I don't what it called but he had to look it up and on his kindle he saw a dictionary.I like about this is because it can not only help you but adults and parents to. What I don't like is that many people don't have dictionary so that why,Lexington,ky public dictionary give everybody one in the state.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had no real expectations of type of story this book held. I had been told \\"you will love it\\" ...I was drawn into the lives of these characters, that seemed to make me feel like they existed in a world similar to medieval times in history, yet could be a run down neighbourhood of any community of modern times. Obviously the hardships Katnis endured during her life gave her the survival instincts needed to not only survive these games, but the humanity to view her competitors as fellow human beings and not just predators.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Fantastic mob movie. Bloody, brutal, and just overall entertaining. The actors are talented, reminds of me the godfather. Love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is alot of fun , I find myself Having a hard time putting it down, Very addictive. Good job Amazon. :)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I feel betrayed by Veronica Roth. We counted down the days until it was released because we enjoyed the other two books so much and this is how she ends it?
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game! Anybody can play. I am 18 and enjoy it. I have older friends and even adult friends who enjoy it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game I love how each level is different. I am so addicted to this game!!!!! Best game I have played thus far.
B00004Z459|5.0|Love old school Linkin Park bought this as a replacement for a cd that got destroyed .great album, cant stand the new stuff now however,
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|It's such a fun game! It's easy to set up and to play. My family and I love playing it!
0399255370|4.0|i bought this for a friend's child's birthday and my kid wanted to read it first-- it was so great i decided to buy it for her too. very creative, crayons talking to the child about how they were being used and their suggestions about how to do things differently or thanking him for drawing so well. great pics too. the only flaw in the book was saying that pink was for girls (hence the four instead of five stars)--and urging him to draw more with the pink crayon, like whales, etc. i really liked the fact that the rest of the book was gender neutral, even though the main character is a boy. (well, the main characters are really the crayons i guess).  i like the emphasis on doing things in an unconventional way. Overall, great book. i'm so relieved to not be reading another dora or diego book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|good game(= Enjoy the ease and challenge. If you did not have to wait so long or pay for more lives, it`d be perfect.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so excited when I opened my email yesterday morning advising me that Candy Crush was available for Kindle. Downloaded it right away and have been playing.  Did not connect to my FB ... started from the beginning...when it was fun and relaxing as opposed to frustrating!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Keeps you on your toes, quick read! Good writing, I was always wondering what was going to happen next, would they find out?
B001XUPF2O|5.0|This is not the cutsie Batman but rather the real deal. It's for mature audiences but certainly exciting. Love the Joker character.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|Before I start this book review I have a confession to make, it is a secret my wife would like to remain unknown. I am an avid gamer and have been since I can remember. So please keep that in mind as I start this review.<br /><br />This book rocks it never stopped surprising and entertaining me from the opening chapter to the end. The author spins a tale that had me staying up late many a night just to read a little bit more. As well as creating a world that is not much of a stretch to believe is around the corner. He pays homage to the history of the humble computer game as well as to their forefathers the never forgotten book driven RPG games such as Dungeon & Dragons. I was like a kid in a candy shop as I was taken for a stroll along memory lane as games, films and TV shows are bought up in the story.<br /><br />The story is where the book hits a home run. A world where fossil fuel and real jobs are rare. Most of humanity lives in a virtual world called Oasis the ultimate social networking and MMO all rolled into one. It is in the Oasis the story runs rampart, we have our hero, a quest and an evil corporation trying to change and corrupt the Oasis forever. This book is for anyone who was bought up in the 80's or has a passing interest in gaming or anything geeky. Even if you do not fit these categories give this book a try and prepare to be entertained.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Drake's music never fails to impress me. I know people say a lot of it sounds the same but we are still listening to it so we must like it. I like how he can rap and sing in the same song and it's not awkward. It's hard for artists to do that. I'm a big Drake fan so I'm bias but I still recommend this cd for sure!
0670026603|5.0|I loved the story and have never cried so much.  I must have used 6 tissues and could barely read.  Could not put the book down until the last page. Just a beautiful and emotional experience.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|So easy to use, even for the novice. Love the free apps. The variety of apps and the large selection will keep me busy for days. lol It will definitely get lots of use!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Thank you for dragging me out of my romance novel rut with such a wonderful story. So scary and sad and real.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Such a build up, for such a huge letdown. The story moved incredibly slowly, introduced about 2 full books worth of plots and content, and then unhappily, viciously, and predictably \\"resolved\\" it, in like 2 short chapters.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed. This was a soggy, lackluster way to finish two epic books. Read it for no other reason than to get resolution from the plot and characters you've fallen in love with. But lower your expectations or you'll be sorely disappointed. And no, I'm not unhappy with the final turn of events- that was so predictable, and it's been foreshadowed throughout the whole series. Of course that would happen. But in those circumstances? It was a huge lack of creativity. Oh well, good riddance to another fizzled trilogy, I suppose.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|I always enjoy seeing George in intense personal relationships. He just does it SO WELL! Missed this at the theatre, so I watched it at home on DVD. This movie is unusual for me in that I really didn't like the way it started, or ended. The middle I enjoyed thoroughly. I am a collector and Class 3 firearms dealer, and especially liked watching him build his gun. Very realistically done. The same with making his mercury-core explosive bullet. after I saw the movie I also bought \\"A Very Private Gentleman\\" - the book that the movie is based on. Different somewhat from the movie, but also very good. This year I also was able to buy the prop-gun from the end of the movie!  Again; super detail.  If you haven't seen it; it is definitely worth a look!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Love Tris and Tobias. It's sad to see them go but I can't wait to see what Roth comes up with next.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Excellent.  Full of information  could have been longer.  Thoroughly enjoted readibg tgis book. Gladwell strikes again! !!!<br />Cant wait for more exciting insights
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I have seen all of them. They are all great. But Iron Man 3 has Heart. A must see with the whole Family.<br />Is one of the few action sci-fi movies that you can watch over and over again. It has Humor, Passion, Action and Comedy.
B007V4LBLU|3.0|Pretty cool film visuals.  Very funny movie.  Makes fun of a bunch of heroin addicts.  A lot of filthy language though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved this awesome app and I would recommend it to everyone who has been a fan of the most cool apps ever!
159463176X|4.0|Not as easy to follow as his previous books, I enjoyed them more than this one. I found it hard to remember who he was talking about. Feel it could have been arranged a little differently ..but still a good read
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing this game on my phone forever!  I love having it on my Kindle Fire in a larger format. Super Awesome!
B006P4FBUE|4.0|I've been \\"playing around\\" with the free version and like it so much I'm ordering the full priced version for only 99 cents. Yes, my device only supports two finger touch, but it's great for that. As a singer, it's nice having pitches available to me or the ability to play my part in show music during rehearsal. Also like the ability to play a full four octaves on one screen, a feature others don't offer. Fun little pocket sized musical instrument with tons of tonal options.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I must say that I was really looking forward to this book. I loved Divergent. I recommend it to students all the time. Insurgent kept me guessing. Allegiant bored me. In fact, I skimmed the last 100 pages or so and I never skim. I felt the whole I'm damaged...no your not...was overplayed. Exactly how many rebellions were in this book? Plus the ending?! What?! Now I know why you switched narrators throughout the book, Veronica Roth. On that note, while I truly enjoyed the first two books in the trilogy, the third fell short of my expectations.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|its great car music material..! i love avenged sevenfold.. and their tribute album to Rev is nothing short of brilliant
B00BD99JMW|2.0|She kills off a main character. Totally not expecting or wanting that to happen. Even though it's clique for them to live happily ever after, what is wrong with that?
B00BPDR3F6|1.0|I was so disappointed with this book. I hated the characters and didn't care to hear whatever became of Alma and her mosses. Weird book - I finally gave up about 2/3 through after she went to Tahiti to find her husband's \\"boy\\"friend.  Very strange.  I loved Elizabeth Gilbert's Eat Pray Love and Committed.  I think I will wait for another non-fiction book from her.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Heart tugging at every corner. Highly recommend.  Not the ending I was hoping for but it's a great book nonetheless.
B00DXP0QV2|5.0|This was great. I especially enjoyed the demos for Marigold and All Apologies. Makes me miss the band more than ever.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Five stars. Loved whole series. Couldn't put them down. Wished she could have lived though. I am a Sucker for happy endings.
1932100660|5.0|This is a serious book for everyone who wants to maximise their health.<br />Every point is well made and backed up by reference to a vast research index. It's compelling in its guidance for healthy living.
B00A86AIAI|5.0|Detail rocks as always !!Love the way the cape spreads on the ground ... not as good as the Aquaman or Superman on detail , but still great !
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We were huge Abbey fans after watching seasons 1 and 2.  Season 3 had some real shockers in it.  I will not be a spoiler!  This is a &#34;must see&#34; if you are an Abbey fan.  Only negative is that Season 4 does not release until January.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so fun I can play every day.I think that every person who played this game thinks the same.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Such a disappointment. I can't believe how horrible this was to read after the enjoyment that was the first two books. The other reviews go into one  detail, but all you bed  to know is that this boom isn't worth it and you are better off imagining an ending of your own.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love the game. Very addicting. Glad I have friends that play so we can send life's back and forth. About time they made app for Kindle.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|One of the most delightfully funny books that I have read in a long, long time. It is light, refreshingly original and always entertain-ing. The reader is constantly awed by the imagination of the author.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this free game. All the deals seem to be winnable. Graphics are great and card movement is fast. It makes the time fly.
006202406X|5.0|Roth stays true to her characters. Bittersweet, but it takes a lot of skill to create a world like she has & I think it soars above other books in the dystopian genre. I loved Hunger Games, since then, this is the only one I've been able to get on board with. Great characters.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is an excellent series based around the time of The Great War in Britian.  I love the cast of characters and the story.  There is suspense and a great meshing of a multitude of personalities.  I can't wait to start Season 3.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It is great to be able to use any Chrome browser (Desktop browser and some tablets) to simply click chromecast icon and display on a big screen wirelessly. Also with newer releases of Chrome, one can leave video running on TV/Monitor while opening a new browser on the desktop. This process is using computer processor and wireless LAN.<br />Audio and Video can be displayed although video quality is not HD unless you stream from Google services directly, Google has added some additional apps for direct streaming such as Netflix but the apps support is very limited. If Google were to allow apps such as Plex to stream directly this could seriously improve video quality. Google app selection needs to be increased significantly to make this device useful. If you only want to stream from Netflix and Hulu, you may OK with this very cheap device.<br />But limitations of applications supported to display directly severely limits its usefulness.<br />*** Outside the streaming capability of the device one other point you must be aware of is that the Chromecast device NEEDs to have a UPnP enabled router. If your home router does not support UPnP it will NOT WORK. Some cable companies provide the home router and lock admin of the router with UPnP turned off. *** Check with your provider before buying. ****<br /><br />Roku is a great alternative with multiple versions of the RoKu starting at nearly the same price as Chomecast. However Roku provide  much great app support (I mean a LOT more). Although Roku does not display your web browser window, with the flexibility of apps available I not sure how much I need a web browser over hundreds of video streaming services that Roku does support. If you need to display your Chrome web window use Chromecast, if not, I would recommend Roku. If Google could improve Chromecast Web sharing video quality and add more apps supported for direct streaming it may be a great product, but it is not there yet though.<br /><br />Apple TV is another alternative and is available globally, but like Chromecast it restricts the apps you can show to ones Apple approve and even worse, lock the Apple Apps on the screen, with no way to remove them. Apple needs to be connected by LAN cable not wirelessly and as such the video quality is potentially better than Google, but less flexible. Apple does deliver a nice click to play from iPhone/iPad but little other options if your content is not always held in Apple. So kind of forcing content to Apple makes them just as bad as Chromecast but but limitations in different ways.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend RoKu. Good start Google, but keep working on it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I really enjoyed this last book and I'm so sad that this is the end of the series.  I can't believe I've been reading this series for over 10 years!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's really fun and addictive, but it's really short. I could easily spend hours playing this game. More rooms please!!!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The fourth season of the Walking Dead begins with a bang! There are so many different angles...it is going to be exciting to watch!
B001BANK32|5.0|New or classic King, it doesn't matter. The master of horror, twists and page turning plots never gets old, even if the book is...
B00127RAJY|5.0|I used this workout program to jumpstart my weight loss efforts--and that it did. I measured and weighed myself (as suggested) before I started; at the end of the thirty days, I lost 22 inches and 12 pounds! I've used nothing but Jillian workouts to lose the next 50!!! So happy I found this video!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Most Americans have relatives that took the gigantic step of leaving their European homelands to come to this land of promise and opportunity. Little did these travelers know that the trials of their journey were just beginning.  This author uses the non-fiction story of train orphans to create vivid characters that cause the reader to cheer and cry as they try to find the rainbow at the end of many storms.  I was captured from the beginning to the end and even read all of the author's references at the end of the book.  I recommended this story to a fellow traveler as I was reading it, only to find out that her Aunt was one of these orphans in Minnesota.  While recommending it to a friend on my return home, she shared that she knew of these orphan trains in Louisianna.  A story that celebrates the tenacity of those who have no control of events that change their lives forever.  I highly recommend this book, you will not forget it!
B00003CXA6|5.0|We recently visited Gettysburg and I gave this to my husband who is a Civil War enthusiast and he enjoyed the movie very much.  Would highly recommend this to anyone who is of Civil War interest.
B00DYEBM3I|4.0|4th album, and the first in 17 years, from this West Coast band led by the magically pure,<br /> fragile and sensually haunted voice of Hope Sandoval + the crystal-sad, pristine country-blues<br /> guitar sounds of David Roback (though I wish he had rocked out a bit more).  Former members<br /> of Opal, Rain Parade.  Beautiful, soft & delicate, gently engulfing, gauzy folk/psych songs that<br /> recall artists such as Galaxie 500, Kendra Smith, Cowboy Junkies, Mojave 3.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|If I could give it less than one star I would.  They try to put too much into the movie time.  Too many policitical overtones during the entire movie.  If you want a good zombie movie rent the Walking Dead series(and as a bonus, no Brad Pitt).  Don't waste your money and your time on World War Z.
B00E1SJDJG|4.0|6th album from Texas singer/songwriter who formerly recorded as Smog—Callahan comes<br /> across as your next door neighbor, who also happens to be an insightful poet and storyteller<br /> blessed with a mesmerizing baritone that feels honest to the core.  His eminently affective,<br /> offhand vocal style and peculiar phrasing is semi-comfortably couched in a laid-back folk/roots<br /> musical style with some unexpected atmospheric side trips.  Sometimes recalls artists like<br /> Leonard Cohen, Josh T. Pearson, Will Oldham, Tim Buckley, Lambchop.  “Dream River” is an<br /> apropos title for an album that flows lazily through unpredictable currents and around unknown<br /> bends.
B008602KQI|5.0|Everyone should read all of the books and watch all of the movies.  I bought them all so that I can read and watch them over and over again.  I wanted to wait to buy the movie until the whole trilogy was out, but I couldn't.  I also bought the books and movie for niece.
B00D2PIUAM|5.0|7th studio album from U.K. band—Brian Moloko has a voice that you either love or hate.  I’m one<br /> of those who find it fascinating.  It’s a beautifully quavering ball of munchkin-like sincerity that<br /> falls in between Geddy Lee from Rush and David Surkamp from Pavlov’s Dog, with a bit of David<br /> Bowie’s epic fervor.  Moloko’s vocals are a perfect complement to the incredibly tight, muscular-<br /> but-smooth arena-style rock music that accompanies them.  The songs often project a dreamy<br /> flow with their big, soaring, repetitive choruses that are glued together with solid, thumping bass<br /> & drums + occasional electronics and strings.  Overall, “Loud Like Love” recalls bands like Muse,<br /> Oasis, The Verve, Twilight Sad, British Sea Power, Biffy Clyro, Suede, Airborne Toxic Event.<br /> While the distinctive peculiarity of Moloko’s voice means this probably won’t appeal to everyone,<br /> it strikes me as an excellent contemporary British rock album.  I like it!
0812984412|4.0|It's a pretty good book.  The &#34;voice&#34; of each character was very unique.  As usual, the book was better than the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad this game is now on my kindle. The game is awesome. Runs very well no issues. Graphics are awesome. So much nicer to pay than on te small screen of my phone
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE CANDY CRUSH&hellip; I started playing this game on Facebook then tried to get it on the Kindle and couldn't. Was totally bummed. Now I'm SUPER stoked it's finally here. Thanks for listening Amazon!! :)
B0081336FO|5.0|If you like mystery, you will like Sherlock S2. Everything flows really well and Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock has style so it makes it worth your while to watch and see where Sherlock takes you. This version is much better than Elementary in my opinion. I lost interest in that show pretty quickly (within the first season) and this one captured my attention.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that Candy Crush has finally made it to the Kindle.<br />I could play it on my laptop and PC, but not on the Kindle.<br /><br />Will enjoy many hours of playing, I think we are getting addicted to our electronics.<br /><br />flo
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I've solved the puzzle on the page, I've clicked on everything but I can't seem to figure out what to do next to move on.  The help just doesn't help.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad they finally got candy crush on kindle they just need more apps that r just as good
0783240503|5.0|I would have preferred the DVD, but all reviews said the audio was terrible and what good is a musical with poor audio?  The tape was purchased to replace my old VHS that was loaned out and never received back.
B00F2362IE|2.0|Game is really non climatic. My son doesn't really like it as much as other free apps such as Temple Run and Minion Rush.
B002E5N6CI|5.0|Nothing like some Hot Buttered Soul to take you back in time.The songs,lyrics and sound are professionally done. Music lovers enjoy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am seriously addicted and my kids are upset. They haven't had any kindle free time since candy crush finally made it to kindle. Loving It!
006202406X|2.0|I am not going to complain about the ending what so ever. Roth can end things how she sees fit, the story came from her mind and if that's the ending she saw years ago when she started this adventure, then I back her 100%.<br /><br />I am going to complain about how poorly this last book was written. I honestly loved the first two books, but this one was such a disappointment. I feel as though she rushed through it, trying to produce a 3rd book so when the Divergent movie comes out, she can sell all 3 books as a box set. True fans would have waited another year (or longer) if it meant the book would have been better.<br /><br />Sentences are short/choppy and scenes were not built/explained as thoroughly as they were before, Readers are often left assuming things or building the scene in their own mind. Reading from both view points would have been nice if she would have written Tris and Four differently. If you are trying to get readers into the two heads of the main characters, the chapters should be written as though Tris/Four were actually thinking them. Are we to believe there is no difference between the two?
0375869026|5.0|I enjoy seeing the confidence built in Auggie as he progresses through what is a difficult time in all middle school kids' lives.  The book shows that it what on the inside of a person that matters the most.  Bravo to R.J. Palacio for writing a book that is much needed in today's society.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  I was so happy to see it is now available for the kindle!  Now if we could just get pet saga.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|I read the books when I was young and loved all of them.  I enjoyed the movie and I am looking forward to the seeing the new movie when it comes out on DVD.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|the beginning was weird (seems like a cop out to just say that the edith prior video was a lie), the middle was boring (really repetitive...how many times do i have to read about tris and tobias tugging at hems and wandering around a hotel?!), and the end was disappointing (really?!). Anything you could imagine happening is better than what actually happens...and I see other reviewers thought the exact same thing. Not worth reading.<br />I think it's strange that a lot of these 5 star reviews say something like, \\"I like the book but acknowledge it had a bunch of problems.\\"  And there were many...the POVs, huge plot holes, slow pace, similar story line, no personal growth for Tris, very little secondary character development, etc... Seems like that is not a 5 star book, even if you did like it.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|I read the Great Gatsby in middle school and absolutely loved it.  Was very impressed with this movie.  I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow free is an amazing game cause it helps your brain start working in the morning before I go to school.
B00F91H666|4.0|Nice zombie flick. Has a different take on the zombie theme, an actual resolution to the zombie problem.  Worth the watch.
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|Quite a bit of drama and teen angst. Not as much action as I imagined there would be. Halo fans may like it.
B00C8S9VKM|4.0|Maybe not as good as some other of his books, but I enjoyed. Typical Bryson. Humorous, entertaining, and informative. 1927? Who knew?
1556438850|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful! I am preparing to get certified as a yoga teacher and this was an essential starting point for me to begin learning. It tied so many concepts together that I had learned from other texts and clearly explained important concepts, provided reflections and is chalk full of helpful advice that I take with me on and off the mat. I highly recommend this book to anyone from the curious beginner to the advanced instructor.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I never wanted it to end.  I'm glad that Alma came into my world.<br />Elizabeth Gilbert is amazing and I can't wait for her next.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|All my friends are addicted to this game including myself. It's great for challenging the mind and so much fun! Dangerously addictive
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I am not going to spoil this but how could you? There were other choices you could have made. I loved this series. I now would not recommend it to anyone!!!!!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Get this game its so worth money I play it everyday I love how u can level up and earn money for agents get it love it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game, lots of updates never boring, I suggest it to anyone of any age, remember it is addictive!!!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The book was really great but sad. And not a little sad. Like, don't-read-in-public-because-it-will-make-you-cry-like-your-whole-family-has-died sad. Not to deter readers. It's worth it. Enjoy.
B0097K21YW|3.0|It was free so can't say too much negative.  I use it just to pass the time if I'm waiting somewhere and don't want to get involved in something time consuming.  It's fun to watch things explode though.  That's the best part of the whole game; the nuclear bombs.
B00DJZR46G|3.0|I love Elton, but would have preferred less singing and more piano. The Dream songs should have been longer. Really was looking for that oomph that just seems missing.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Episodes are almost as long as a movie, very entertaining. Characters are fun and engaging, plots are smart, witty, and never dull.
B009R8DJ72|3.0|I think that this book deserves this rating because  for other people whose rating s are different this is the rating which I think it deserves. I thought this book was some how funny and I recommend it to anyone who has a great taste in books. I cannot wait until I get  Diary of a Wimpy kid: Hard Luck.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|My Linux server boots in mere seconds from an SSD drive.  This is a fast processor!<br /><br />It is also very power efficient.  The server (including the SSD and a hard drive) draw less than 30 W most of the time (near idle).  At heavy workload it would be more, but power efficiency near idle is important, since that's where the server operates most of the time.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy playing. Getting bonuses is fun. It isn't too hard for a technically challenged senior.  Thanks. Helpful hints would help some of us. goals need to be posted.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|This was great: Just install CPU, memory and storage, load Linux, and it all worked fine.<br /><br />With an Ivy Bridge processor, this system is also very power efficient.  At modest workload (e.g. seeking disk), I've measured its power draw from the wall outlet at under 30 W.  Of course, heavy workload could require more; but low power consumption near idle was exactly what I wanted for a server which would stay on at all times.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Boring, boring and more boring. It was hard work getting thru this novel, I say novel because I think the author took a lot of liberty in her stories and in rethinking this she should have taken more.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Let me start off by saying is that this book was up there for one of my favorite book series. Right next to Harry Potter and the Hunger Games. I would tell my friends that it could quite possibly be my favorite because i absolutely loved the first 2 books but it depended on the ending, because lets face it, the ending is what makes or breaks the series.<br /><br />With that being said, i felt a roller coaster of emotions. I had been anxiously waiting for the final book to come out for months and was a little let down. the story didnt have as much action and fighting as the first two books did and it got really repetitive and extended in some parts. it had things that could have been left out and some things felt forced in.<br /><br />The ending is obviously the part that everyone is going to talk about. i was heartbroken that Roth had killed Tris. I had grown attached to the character and thought that she was going to get her happy ever after. Yes, i understand that its the type of book where stuff like this happens, but after reading some other reviews, i have to agree where it may not be the fact that Tris died but the manner. She was all up for Caleb sacrificing his life but then at the last second she doesn't because she knows he doesn't want to. it really gave me a sour taste with the story because i had thought she had gotten over the stupid sacrifice thing for Tobias. I felt like she didn't consider even for a split second about him until it was too late. And i agree with some other reviewers, if you are going to kill off your main character, then you should do it in a manner that honors them and leads peace and resolution. Tris's death pretty much only honored Caleb's cowardicy and there was no resolution. and what's worse, her killer, David and the other guards, doesn't even get punished for it.<br /><br />I guess I had hoped/expected Tobias and Tris to survive and get their happy ending because they had been through so much in the first two books. as i wasreading it, i knew something big was going to happen because it had been calm up until then but what i thought was Tobias's memory was going to get wiped/reset and he wouldn't remember her. The more i think about it the more i wish that that was the ending. b/c it still would have had that surprise tragedy but at the same time it has hope for the future that they could end up together again.<br /><br />Overall, i can't say i hated the book. because i didnt. i'm not going to boycott the series just because i did agree with the story. being an English major in college it kind of made me more open-minded and accepting. I know that i will reread the series again in the future, but i'll probably stop reading it in the last scene that Tobias and Tris are together and they say they love each other (at least for a little while). I'm not going to boycott the movies because i think the movies are going to be fun to watch and i have a funny feeling that they are probably going to change the ending to Allegiant's movie (especially after seeing the fan backlash)
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|This is a review of the 3D version of the film.  Something I really loved about Iron Man 3 in 3D is that there aren't all those 3D &#34;gags&#34; that some films do.  Sure, the explosions are amazing and it looks like things are flying toward you, but that's not the main focus of the movie.  I never felt like the effects did anything except enhance the story.  The action scenes are amazing in 3D, though sometimes there is so much motion going on that if you're at all sensitive to that you might want to close your eyes.  I actually had to take a break for a bit after the mansion scene to rest, before watching any more.  If you have 3D capability, and you're a fan of Iron Man, I would definitely recommend going for the 3D version!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY CANDY CRUSH ON THE KINDLE FIRE WOOHOO GREAT GAME! VERY ADDICTIVE GAME. I've been waiting for this app and they definitely delivered no problems so far for me :)
B00355L2TU|5.0|High intensity workout that can easily be done in any home in an easy thirty minutes. You can feel the burn!
B00E9E4E50|5.0|I have admired Lisitsa's playing in other discs, but I had some hesitation about buying this one.  I like some Liszt, but too often it sounds bombastic to me.  Even pieces that I admire, like the B Minor Sonata, are pieces I like to hear just on occasion.  But I was intrigued by the program, which contains some pieces that are not often heard.  And it included her encore specialty, the Ave Maria.<br /><br />Well, I was completely surprised. This is a disc you will want to play many times.  The lyrical passages are lovely, and as one reviewer notes, Decca did a great job on the sound.  Once again, her artistry and technique bring insights to the music. We shall see how her career goes, but she has a shot at being viewed as one of the legends of the piano.
B00005ATQM|3.0|My fault for not looking closely enough, but it doesn't have support for Dolby Pro Logic II so it plays as just stereo. The album is still one of my favorites of all time. Also, you can still buy this for $18.99 from the bands website.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Been a huge fan of Clutch since Pure Rock Fury and have loved the blues infused rock, so honestly I wasn't sure about the album on first listen...then I saw half the album performed live and it clicked, this is one of my favs now. If you have never seen Clutch live GOOOO!! you will not be disappointed. \\"If your not gonna take it to the stage, then don't do it all!\\" ...this album was written to be done live.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Don't waste your money, or time in reading this book.  And if you have to read it because you are a die hard Divergent fan like I WAS don't bother finishing it you won't be happy! The first 70% of the book was so boring and had NO story line and the last 20% was just awful. So many different directions this book could have gone and it just took the worst one. So disappointed.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Take it from someone who has never been a real big fan of AlterBridge, but like their music. This is the best album they have done. I'm one that rarely listens to an album over and over but keep finding myself returning to this day after day. The first track sucks you in and it is hard to stop after that.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|It's great but you have to play forever to get the robot you want but other than that great game
B001XJEKGC|3.0|I bought this product for Eric Clapton but there is too much of Steve winwood on the DVD but I added it to my collection none the less. Not the sellers fault.
B0089LOG02|4.0|A wonderful story melding the past with the present, and showing a part of the country's past that I never knew about before.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Whats not to love about Iron Man in HD Blu Ray. Still gets watched over and over in this house.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app helped get rid of the junk I don't need.  I could then get even more apps.  Plus, this is free!!!!!  GET IT NOW!!!!!
143911000X|5.0|Love the book, love the show, love the actor (not that way - but not that there's anything wrong with that...)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really enjoy this game but for some reason it will occasionally freeze up on me. great graphics and interaction.
B004SVM7BW|3.0|I'm running this application in my new kindle fire. I like it because I can use the text to speech feature when I'm &quot;reading&quot; scientific journals. I can run, hike or do other things. It has great note taking capability too. The only problem I have with it is finding my bookmarks in order. I can't label them either but that maybe because I haven't found out how yet. I hope that when they update, they will include insert notes with label, and categorize the note by date or name. Would be awesome if the notes can also be grouped . I also wish I can turn off screen to conserve power when in text to speech mode.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it.  First game I play each day and last game I play at night.  Took a long time for ot to be on kindle
B0048LPRCS|5.0|I received this DVD yesterday afternoon and it was in my DVD player by 6pm.  I can honestly say that I was captivated.  Such a cool film!  I love that you are viewing the film in &#34;Oscar's&#34; head.  I am very much interested in rebirth, Buddhism, enlightenment, existentialism and psychedelics; this film did not disappoint.  Amazing film that will blow your mind wide open.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Total bizarre read. I'm sure there is a symbolic meaning to everything going on in the story,kept trying to find it.<br />But in the end I was still as confused as when the book began. No I would not recommend this at all!
B006S08RLU|5.0|Such a great movie - captures your imagination and all of the quirkiness of life. Too good! Shout out to all of the dreamers.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game world be a five stars if you were not timed out and have to wait to play again.  If you had your friends at your house and you were playing a game we would not stop one another and say OK you have to wait 24 minutes to continue.  That is irritating!
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|First caught this band on Clapton's Crossroads concert from Chicago.  They just blew me away.  I was a little nervous about the bass chair change, but the new guys did a great job, especially Pino.  All I can say is the more you listen to this disc the more you'll like it.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Comfortable, Attractive, Accurate, totally customizable, DPI changing a little inconvenient compared to some, but that is the ONLY drawback. Perfect.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I expected more from the ending of this trilogy, but the story never quite climaxed for me. It felt like a completely different world than the world of the first two books. At times, the character development seemed contrived or forced. The title didn't really fit the main storyline. The &#34;allegiant&#34; played such a minor role in the entire novel, that if you weren't paying attention and it wasn't the book's title, you might have missed that storyline entirely.<br /><br />The author tried to make too big of a world in the last book of a series. It's as though she couldn't figure out how to resolve the issues without including a broader, less believable arc.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|We both, love  the game, we spend a lot of time playing  it is very addictive once u get started
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|this is one of those games where you need real money to get any father in it. graphics are good but its just not worth it
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This was a good ending to the Divergent Trilogy. Another great YA series. I hope it get young adults thinking about the larger things in life.
B00EAIMGDW|1.0|this game is boring dont know why its still out there there are much better games to play with better graphics
B004LUS390|5.0|I've been using this app on my Note II for almost a year now and it works like a dream. It has replaced my hardcopy sketchbook and its functionality has offered easy integration to my WordPress sketch blog.<br /><br />At first the controls seem odd and complex, but if you just spend a little bit of time getting use to the layout you'll find that is surprisingly intuitive and well thought-out.  The fact that you can layer artwork and control various brush attributes is astonishing for this app. I've tried the desktop version of the app but I find myself on my phone all the time and the mobile version is just more natural to me in terms of its ease of use. It's a bit like an older version of Photoshop in many ways.<br /><br />If you're an artist and you have a Galaxy Note series phone, get this app.  The WACOM digitized screen on the Note plus the stylus offers amazing control. I was blown away by how well this works compared to my WACOM graphics tablet attached to my PC.<br /><br />My only wishes for the app would be better resolution on images, canvas size control and greater word art/graphic text functionality. I wish I could post some of my sketches here in this review. If you get a chance, google the blog Nguyening It.

B009GEYX5E|4.0|**Novice camera user**<br /><br />I bought a used camera at a Salvation Army and wanted to see if it worked. This was the cheapest film for the camera. It worked fine and the picture quality was good for my picture taking ability. The only issue I have is that it is $20+ for 8 pictures. Other than that, it is great!

B000ELJBAK|1.0|Some have reviewed this album, claiming it to be superior to any and all of Waters solo efforts. Some point to the Billboard ratings as evidence of this. The Billboard 200 ratings has this album peaked at 29, while Amused To Death by Waters, reached 21. The argument doesn't hold Water(s). This Gilmour release is nowhere near the caliber of Amused To Death. or Pros and Cons, or Radio KAOS. It just isn't.<br /><br />The only reason this album managed to make it to the US charts, or to sell gold, was because of the Gilmour's name, and the long-established fanbase of Pink Floyd fans; many who predate Gilmour's arrival in the band. After all, Gilmour was first a stand-in guitarist for the band before he became a replacement guitarist. Gilmour was a newcomer before he litigated for the rights to the group name, that again, pre-existed his arrival. If it were not for this pre-existing fanbase, Gilmour's album would have been the commercial flop that it sounds like when played. The objective truth of this statement can be found on the radio; when is the last time that anyone can remember hearing any single track from this album played on a classic rock radio station? I can't remember hearing even one track on commercial radio in the last 30 years or more. I have heard Waters' solo stuff, from Amused, RadioKAOS, and others.<br /><br />There is a reason, when compared side by side to Pink Floyd works, why this album and in fact all other Gilmour solo releases to date are laughable messes: they lack in concept and content. During the 5-album Floyd run at success, Waters was the driving, creative force. He wrote most of the lyrics and music. He developed the concepts. It was HIS vision, and Dave Gilmour was the replacement guitarist that he was hired to be. With the exception that Waters was working hard to put money into the pockets of the other 3 potted plants, it all worked well.<br /><br />When Dave Gilmour grew up and decided that he was the star and driving force, the world got this laughable mess. Disjointed. Pink Fraud. Mihalis, the first track, is Gilmour trying so hard to sound like Pink Floyd. The instrumental meanders about without any real structure or point, as Gilmour tries very hard to sound like Pink Floyd. Track 2, There's No Way Out of Here, is the perfect sentiment to describe the feeling you will have after listening to Track 1. In this track, Gilmour attempted to break out of the Pink Floyd sound, adopting instead a CSNY (especially Y) guitar sound; that brown, distorted chunking sound Neil made famous. Unfortunately, the trademark Gilmour marshmallow vocals clash with the brown sound, making it hard to listen to. To make matters worse, the lyrics were not only not worthy of Pink Floyd, they weren't worthy of Neil Young either. These two tracks are a roadmap for the rest of the album. There is no need to go further, describing the mess track by track.<br /><br />Waters was, and remains, a genius. The concept albums he developed for Floyd will stand the test of time for many generations. The same high standards can be found throughout Waters' solo works. Amused To Death is one of Waters' best works EVER, including his Pink Floyd successes. The album had a point; a message. Each song told a bit of the story, flowing into the next. The album had a coherent conclusion. \\"David Gilmour\\" by Gilmour is not any of that. It is a pointless album, containing no concepts or messages. The songs are not cohesive, and tell no story. At the end of the album, there is no conclusion... except that the audio stops (thank Buddha); and frankly, that is the only good thing about the album.<br /><br />Yes, I could put on blinders, and ignore the fact that this stand-in guitarist, and later this replacement guitarist, sued for rights to a name that preceded him. I could ignore that Waters wrote the vast majority of lyrics and music during Floyd's 5-album run at success. I could ignore the fact that Gilmour and the other two houseplants contributed little and whined a great deal, while Waters did the actual work to make them all stinking rich. I could also ignore Gilmour's meager contributions to those albums. I could ignore this, and just this album on it's own merits, as if written/performed by a new artist. What would that review sound like? It would be significantly shorter, pointing out only that the songs are amateurish at best, and that the album is entirely forgettable and regrettable.<br /><br />Whether you put blinders on, and attempt to review this album on its own merit, or whether you take the whole history of Pink Floyd into account, the end result is likely to be the same: this album is a turd. You can't shine a turd, no matter how hard you rub.ibuted little and whined a great deal, while Waters did the actual work to make them all stinking rich.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|Every woman should read this book whether you're in business or not. I heard myself in Sheryl's words all too often, the self doubt, the self sabotage. It's refreshing to recognize that it's universal and that we can change that behavior.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The subject and theme of the book is one that we are all sadly familiar with; WWII and its effect on the people of Germany, both jew and gentile. However, this book written through the eyes of a precocious and compassionate young girl who is coming of age during that period, tells us that a person can survive terrible tragedies if they have even just one thin thread to hang on to and persevere.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|It will take less than seven days for this movie to make you a man. I love this movie more everytime I watch it. 35th anneversary is a must for any fan.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|This is a star wars type movie with action and adventure on two worlds.  Yet John finds the link between them and joins in a age old battle of good versus evil.  He has to prove himself and chooses sides to help a Princess and her search for freedom and prosperity for her people.  Other races join in the fight and John finally figures out the connection between the two worlds and what part he will play in it.  It is interesting how the life force is delt with and what religeous practices tried to understand it.  This is worth seeing if you enjoyed the star wars series.
0131103628|3.0|I really wanted to love this book. Really, I did. I'm a highly self-motivated student who has made it to Senior year of my undergrad program by largely ignoring my professors and teaching myself from textbooks. There's nothing I love quite as much as curling up with a CS book and studying.<br /><br />But this book, this one I find incomprehensible. I've spent many hours trying to read and decipher the endless walls of text in front of me, but as I finally near the last chapter, I have precious little to show for my time. It is, perhaps, a generational gap; but I must ask, why on earth would one compile endless and only vaguely related lists of technical information into - prose, of all things? Why must its English language be as dense and compacted as its code? Elegance of phrasing and vocabulary, while critical and invaluable to a sound program, does not inherently a good education make. A picture is worth a thousand words, my friends, and while I do not need the glossy magazine-esque brochures printed by some publishers as &#34;texts&#34;, I do firmly believe that formal writing is distinctly the wrong presentation format for the numerous useful concepts in this text. It distracts from the code instead of enhancing it, the result of which was detrimental to my attempts to grasp the intricacies of C.
B00AAQHP66|4.0|I like surf moves and this one is one of the best and it is based on a true story, which I really like those king of movies.  I would recommend this movie.
B0058UXHHK|2.0|This book was just okay. Not thrilling but not completely boring either. Rather funny at some points and that helped add to the appeal. Not really a book I will ever remember reading and not one I care to find out what happens next in. It was just okay.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i like this game very much it is a easy game but u should get alot of coins so we could make our own persin in the game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that Candy Crush is now available  for  Kindle.  I love this game and now I can play while away from home.
B00BOLFRKW|5.0|Beautifully done period piece that shows the grittier side of politics, but demonstrates how important things can get done with good leadership, despite the serious differences in the two opposing sides.  I think they should lock our current congress in the capital and show this movie to them over and over until they get it!<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Fields and Daniel Day Lewis are fantastic in this movie, and although no one living today knows exactly what Lincoln sounded like or saw his mannerisms first hand, Daniel Day Lewis made me believe they had Abe himself playing this role.  It is easy to see why Lewis is a two time Oscar winner.<br /><br />WATCH THIS FILM
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Wonderful and loving, I encourage everyone to see this wonderful masterpiece with their family, specially during the holidays and ever<br />Annette

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game ever and I am so glad that amazon finally made the app available for kindle but the only thing this kindle needs now is the official instagram app
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|This album is brilliant.This  is coming from someone who is not a fan of this type of music, but this is extremely innovative music. Ground breaking effort from Kanye!
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|douglas was unnaturally brilliant -- in a surprisingly poignant and selfishly arrogant way. it is a master turn in acting. he really outshone all the fancy trappings he was surrounded by and immersed in. however, matt damon's character  could've and should've been played by a better actor. someone with more sex appeal and charm. the directing and other technical contributions were all top-drawer. a splendid way to spend an evening.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this game it is soooo much fun!!!! My sister loves it. she wont stop taking my kindle from me to play it.
B00E3JGCHO|5.0|I listen to this so much. I wish I would've bought the box set though. Great quality & great music. The Band is the best!!
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|This was a well filmed, interesting documentary that is worth watching whether you like sushi or not. It is an insightful look into Japanese culture, family dynamics, and work ethics. People in the US should watch and take notes. The sushi making process (selection, preparation, serving) and the interpersonal relationship dynamics between the master chef and his sons, apprentices, vendors, customers, etc. are also quite interesting to watch. Just make sure you have time to watch and read subtitles- it is entirely in Japanese and this is one you won't want to look away from.

B003W77TPC|5.0|Possibly Garner's best!<br /><br />This recording of a &#34;live&#34; concert at Carmel CA in 1955 really works a treat, and Eddy Calhoun - bass, and Denzil Best - drums, provide perfect backing.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I have been dieting off and on for years only to fall back into old habits.  My step-daughter started reading this book and then told me about it.  Well it changed the way I look at food.  The writing style is laid back but it makes you think about your body's relationship to the food we take in every day.  Yes, I've heard it all before but somehow the way it was written sunk in this time.  After reading the book I started on their Whole30 plan and have lost 18 months in one month.  My 2 co-workers have started it also.  What we have agreed upon is we are no longer looking for snacks in the mid-afternoon and are making wiser choices when we eat and what we eat.  I will be staying on this way of eating for the rest of my life and so will my friends and step-daughter.
B0052GACNM|4.0|I very interesting concept, with the great Tony Bennett performing with many of today's popular singers.<br /><br />Those old favourites such as &#34;The Lady Is A Tramp&#34;, &#34;One For My Baby&#34;, &#34;Body And Soul&#34;, etc., have a different feeling with the likes of Lady Gaga, the late Amy Winehouse, Queen Latifah, Josh Groban, Alejandro Sanz, etc., however in only a couple of instances not to my taste.
B00BATKPBE|2.0|Not having read &#34;The Selfish Gene&#34; maybe I am missing something. Or maybe I just don't like prequels. In any case I found this tome repetitive and simplistic.<br />Not going to waste a lot of words, just going to ask for my money back
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Unexpectedly fantastic. This isn't some lame romantic musical. I always loved acapella because it takes so much more skill than group singing to music. The songs are great. And even better, this movie is hilarious. It takes a lot these days for a movie to make me really laugh out loud hard and Pitch Perfect did that several times. I made everyone watch it and they loved it.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|like all three of them. like the way they put thier spin on the songs. you should get this one.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Purchased this when my daughter was 3 months old. She was too little for it at that time. Now that she's 4 months old she loves it. She can't reach the ground yet, but we put something under her feet to help. She loves to jump!

B004HO6HWA|5.0|I have the original Mechanic with Charles Bronson and always liked it.  I don't usually like remake movies, but this one was actually good.  We did enjoy it and will undoubtedly watch it again in the future. I'd recommend it to others.

B00DVKOYBM|5.0|This is a really good and fun game and I really like this game too and I don't dislike anything about this game at all
B008JFUO72|5.0|Many movies with multiple sequels tend to go downhill on the sequels, but the Iron Man movies are still doing good.  We definitely liked this one and will watch it again.  I would recommend it to others.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|This book is a typical Scarpetta mystery, with her continuous ramblings.  The last few Scarpetta books have been a boring mess of rambling reteric. It seems that Cornwell has run out good writing and has to fill her books with nonsensical stuff that makes Scarpetta seem to be losing it mentally. The mystery itself is quiet good and yet disappointing.  There was no explanation of why Marino was targeted by the killer. Overall, this book was a real disappointment.<br />I hope her next book will be better.<br />The Scarpetta novels had been my favorite for a long time.
B002ZG999U|5.0|We definitely liked this movie.  Lots of action and even had some comedy mixed in.  I'll be watching it plenty more times and would recommend it to others.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I also have it on my iPhone. I really like the challenges this app has because it makes me stop and think.
B00BB67UNW|2.0|Too hard to follow the storyline most of the time.  Kind of boring.  Not really the type of movie we like to watch.  I probably wouldn't recommend it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey! I happened upon it accidentally in the first season and loved it immediately. I have watched all three seasons several times and am anxiously awaiting season four!
B0026QC0TA|5.0|I was very entertained by this movie and sucked in to the story line.  Matt Damon and Danny DeVito didn't disappoint.
B00EBJ624O|4.0|Having been in the audience when Yuja Wang performed these two concerti with the San Francisco Symphony under Michael Tilson Thomas in Davies Hall, I was hoping that these 'live' recordings with Gustavo Dudamel and the Sim&oacute;n Bolivar Symphony Orchestra at the Sala Sim&oacute;n Bolivar in Caracas, Venezuela, would approximate those exhilarating experiences. The short answers are no and yes. No recording, despite the significant improvements in sound engineering, can duplicate being present, but oddly the sound of Rachmaninov's third concerto was flat and dry. There was no feeling of depth, perhaps because of the venue. As for the performance, I was expecting an exciting reading under Dudamel, but the feeling of this lush romantic and dramatic Russian composition was Germanic Brahmsian and stately. It was nowhere near the power and zest of Martha Argerich's old recording with the RSO Berlin (how is that for irony?), and my Russian mother would have been disappointed. Still, Wang presents a new face of technical and dynamic nuance to the concerto with reserved thoughtfulness, and the close microphones at the piano allows crispness and detail. Prokofiev's second concerto is a favorite of mine, and here Yang brings out its modernism, the angularity and wit and darkness, and the large array of mood and color. Her performance is much like Horacio Guti&eacute;rrez with the Royal Concertogebouw Orchestra, but this recording is superior by its sound and, again, detail at the piano keyboard. It has become my new favorite performance. Wang, here, does provide an excellent example of her astonishing talent. Considering the album as a whole, with its well-selected pairing of concerti, I am in the main pleased, but I am glad to have heard them under better circumstances, where eye and ear were both involved, and know why Yuja Wang is a star of the concert stage.

I am not a heavy gamer, but I do like to play a number of first person shooter games that require decent graphics hardware.  I quickly wished I had gone with the A8 or A10.  However, I have no complaint about the processor as it was I who mismatched my hardware with my tasks.<br /><br />For my mom's computer where she just surfs the internet, watches youtube and hulu, does email and some word processing, this little processor has been a gem.

Allegiant is the kind of books why i read predictable, HAPPY ending books.<br /><br />Maybe they'll change the ending for Allegiant in the movie. I hate it when in movies they change some of the story but Hollywood I'm giving you a free pass on this one.
B00CHILW64|3.0|The fact it was based on a true story was quite moving.  It was quite well done with all things considered.

B00CNGA1PS|1.0|This is horrible! There is no stop! Even when I deleted the ap it would not shut up. I finally had to turn off my Kindle (Fire HD). Maybe its just me but even if it is it should not be that hard to figure out. I am sure there are much better ones out there so skip this.
B00514HDNW|5.0|So this is about the 10th \\"last man on earth\\" (its always a man isn't it, funny) novel that I have read, and I would have to say this is one of the best one so far.  I went into this novel having seen the Will Smith movie, and not liking it so much.  I think the deal is this:  If you like the movie, you won't like the book, and vice versa.  I wondered how I would like a novel where the human race has be destroyed by vampires, rather than zombies, nuclear war, or plague, but I would have to say, I think that for the context of this novel, it matters not at all how the human race was extinguished, it just was, and was replaced with vampire-like beings.  The book reminded me a lot of 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthy, in that the main focus of the novel is this how this last man deals with being alone on earth with little or no companionship.  The book is a touch dated because it was written in the 60's, the vampires are a bit cliched and his views on women and sex are almost funny at times (for example, the female vampires try to lure him out of his house by being naked, and he sits inside and pounds his fist to the walls and drinks and can't look outside for fear of being lured out of the house for cheap sex).  What I really liked about this novel, and why I gave it 5 instead of 4 stars, is it deals with so much, in so little space, its not a long novel, but it has a lot of depth, and its very accessible.  The main character is your typical every day normal guy (I don't think it even said what he did before, other than \\"he worked at a plant\\", I assume nuclear power plant?  So he is Homer Simpson then?).  I'm sure you could sit down and pick this novel apart for its cliches and silly vampireisms, but in the end, you turn quickly from page to page, desperately wanting something to go right for this guy, and of course, you know it can't.  He is the last human alive, surrounded by vampires, alone.  Simply put.  He is Legend.

B00DJZR46G|3.0|I would imagine anyone taking the time to read this review is a lover of Elton John's immensely beautiful catalog.  And you can see from some of my other reviews, outside Victim of Love, I have it all.  All the B sides, soundtracks, yes, I even have The Muse.  Elton was and always will be my first musical love.<br /><br />All the talk on this record is that Elton is \\"back to form\\"!  A return to his roots, playing the piano etc...  I think since Songs From the West Coast, (a 5 star album no less), he's predominantly focused on straight forward productions without any technological wizardry.  I always find that hype amusing. \\"He's back\\"!  Where'd he go?<br /><br />Anyway, I've had this album since release date, and frankly, the best I can say is it's just not as good as it should be.  The production is there.  Elton's piano playing and voice are in spectacular form.  But what's missing is the most important thing...  the songs.<br /><br />Mind you, outside Mexican Vacation, which is just is poor man's rip off of Sleeping With the Past's \\"I Never Knew Her Name\\", there isn't a bad song on the record.  It's just so darn repetitive.  The songs almost all fall into the same beats per minute. Slow, mid tempo pieces without a truckload of melody to distinguish them from each other.  Many have said things like, that's how he did it on Tumbleweed.  Yes, that is.  But the songs on Tumbleweed are far superior. And I'm not one of those trolls who thinks his 70's catalog is the only good thing he's got going for him.  I think Songs From the West Coast is easily in his top ten albums of all time.  Maybe even top 5.  Heck songs like Emperor's New Clothes are reminiscent of that style of writing, and I find Emperor to be vastly superior to anything on this record.<br /><br />That being said, there are a few highlights.  Voyeur was originally the title track and I can see why.  It should have remained the title track.  It's by leaps and bounds the best song on the record.  The extended ending with the piano fills is pure magic.<br /><br />For my money, the second best song isn't even on the proper album.  The song 5th Avenue was placed on the bonus disc.  And while all three songs on the bonus disc have the same somber piano intro issue that plagues the proper album, 5th avenue's chorus takes it to a higher level.<br /><br />And the rest?  They're OK.  Oceans Away is nice.  The chorus of The Ballad of Blind Tom starts out so fun.  \\"Play Me Anything you like, I'll play it back to you\\".  But then it ends so flipping predictably, \\"But it's some...thing that I want\\" .  Grrr...  Come on Elton - dig deeper.  A Town Called Jubilee and Take This Dirty Water sound like B sides from the Peachtree Road sessions.<br /><br />I know some of the rabid Elton fans will vote this review with a thumbs down, and that's fine, fire away.  From my chair, with all the hype leading up to this album and the fact that Elton delayed it's release by nearly a year because he felt it was important to get it right, the results simply don't justify the wait.  A good, but certainly not great album.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book just as much as Fifty Shades Grey!  it is hot and the story is great..makes me want to live on New York in a high rise building ...lol.  this book made me read before work..at lunch and we'll into the night...luved it ;) Tricia B.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I read all 3 books in the series.  This was my least favorite :( however because it a part of a series I would recommend you at least skim it to find out how the series ends.
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|the game is very good and after a few tries I got use to using two fingers to navigate and shoot but every time I turned around the game was taking me to a screen to get glu credits and it took away from the game with all the advertisments and cost to buy stuff to go forward.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Ridiculously addictive little game, a lot of fun. Love that it has a lot of stuff you can earn without spending real money, very rare in a freemium game.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This is just a walk-through of uploading a book to Amazon. There's not much in the way of formatting instruction. It's good for a complete novice's first time. But the website does a good job of explaining how to upload your work. I don't think I'd pay money for this one.
B00FPH6PRK|5.0|I thought this movie was gonna be a little more hokey then it was.  It was pretty intense for most of the movie.  You have some pieces of it that felt like a paranormal activity movie, but overall it was a good blend of horror and suspense.  A lot of good use of score and silence, better then most movies in this genre.  We were looking for a good Halloween rental and my wife and I both enjoyed our choice.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It's fun yet challenging. It would be more fun if it weren't for the limited number of turns that can only be rectified by micro-transactions or begging Facebook friends for help.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This story has many parts. Some of them most us of will be able in identify with in some way. Very moving. It gives meaning to &#34;family.&#34;
B0042FZWC0|4.0|I really liked this book.  I bought the audiobook based on a referral from someone that I respect.  The reason that I found this book helpful is that is really enlightened me and helped me see that there is an entire world out there that I had been missing.  All that I have ever known is the 8-5 cubicleville lifestyle.  Thanks to Chris for sharing his story and helping me see that there is another possible lifestyle and way of thinking about work and creating the life that I want.  He doesn't say that it's easy, but that it's possible.  He gives us hope and permission that living a life that is authentic to ourselves is possible.  This book is along similar lines to &#34;A Million Miles in a Thousand Years&#34; that also helped me think new ideas.<br />This book isn't for everyone.  this book will challenge your status-quo thinking.  I recommend looking up and reading Chris's Manifesto and seeing if it resonates with you first.  If it doesn't, this book isn't for you.  Google AONC Manifesto.
B00AALHW6Y|4.0|This album \\"True Believers\\" is his third country album. The previous two \\"Learn To Live\\" and \\"Charleston SC 1966\\" both topped the Billboard Country album charts and produced five No.1 singles.<br />I was fortunate enough to see him at the O2 Arena London in August 2011 and can assure you he is equally as good on stage as he is in the recording studio.<br />The album title track \\"True Believers\\" is a mid tempo song that tells of a young couple who wed and in spite of their friends and relations saying the marriage would not last, it has. This couple proved that their marriage can endure the ups and downs of life, as they are true believers in each other and share the same hopes and dreams. This song would make an ideal dedication to the one you love on a wedding anniversary (this track has already topped the Country singles \\"most requested\\" chart.)<br />\\"Miss You\\" A lovely song, enchanting musically, it tells of heartbreak and a love that has grown cold. They live under the same roof, but no longer have any physical contact (it reminds me of an old song with the lyrics `We hardly ever speak and never touch at all' ) \\"Lay down in this big 'ole bed and you turned on the TV /  Fell asleep without a goodnight kiss or even an I love you  / How can we go on tonight and not even touch one another? / How can we say we're still in love and not be lovers ?\\". Sung to perfection, it is my favourite track.<br />\\"Wagon Wheel\\" (Features Lady Antebellum). This song was originally sketched by Bob Dylan and later completed by Ketch Secor of Old Crow Medicine Show in 2004. It is the only track on this album that Darius has not been involved in writing. Although it is proving a hit, it does not appeal to me. I asked a U.K. muso' as to why is it so popular in the U.K. He told me, \\"from a musician's point of view, it's easy to play, it's a foot tapper and the chorus is catchy\\". Some say the song conjures up visions of old Western movies, wagon trains and campfire songs. However, having read the lyrics, this song appears to tell of a man leaving the hard times in the northern states to `hitch' his way down south to the woman he loves and die a free man... \\"And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free\\" (the last line of the song).<br />\\"Love Without You\\" Sheryl Crow joins Darius on this very pleasant ballad, a good vocal combination. It is another story of a broken relationship. He is gradually learning to live without her and his friends are encouraging him to start socializing again. They try to fix him up with someone new, but it is too soon to consider a new love...the chorus says it all \\"I can walk into a room without you / And I don't get drunk and talk about you / So I guess I've learned to live without you / I just don't know how to love without you\\"<br />\\"Lost In You\\" It's a Spring Break vacation song (it is the style of song I would associate with Luke Bryan, not Darius Rucker) The setting is, blue seas, white sands and golden sunsets. It is a holiday romance which ends with sad farewells and lasting memories.<br />\\"I Will Love You Still\\" features Mallory Hope. The song tells of the woman he loves walking out and leaving him. He knows she will soon forget him and the love they shared, but he will never forget her. \\"Don't even try to explain / What you're leaving me for / Cause you won't cry / And you won't call / And you won't even miss me at all /<br />But I will / Yeah I will\\"<br />\\"Shine\\". A story song, it tells of a soldier returning home in 1943. He had been away for two years, but his childhood sweetheart has been waiting for him. He places an engagement ring on her finger and this ring sparkles and shines throughout their 50 years of marriage. When she passes away the ring is passed to her daughter who will wear it on a chain around her neck on family occasions. Later, the ring will be given to her son, to give to the woman he marries to shine as a token of their love and remind them of the undying love of his grandparents.... A charming song in traditional Country style.<br />\\"Radio\\". Cast your mind back to when the only in car entertainment was the car radio. This song tells of a 17 year old lad driving an old wreck of a car. The only thing in good working order was the radio \\"Ridin' down the highway / Who wants to be the DJ / I'll find a spot on the side of the road / You find somethin' on the radio / Like a feel real good song / We'll know it when it comes on / Didn't have no money, no place to go / All we needed was a radio\\" ... in those days the DJ's choice of music influenced your choice of music as you heard very little else, and on occasions a song on the radio could make or break a moment of romance (or passion). This song has an infectious Latin Country beat and  is rapidly climbing the Country charts.<br />\\"Take Me Home\\"  The title says it all. He's home sick and missing all the things he holds most dear, his wife and family and all the familiar sights and sounds of his home town.<br />I have selected a few of the twelve tracks from \\"True Believers\\" to review, but all are worthy of a mention. It is a good album, both vocally and musically with lyrics on various subjects.<br />Rita
006202406X|1.0|After waiting 2.5 years to find out the conclusion to this story we get THAT! I am beyond disappoint, and even more sad. I truly loved this series, and I honestly really enjoyed this last book until the end. Sadly, that ruined the series for me. These were books I had planned on rereading multiple times in the future but now I don't think I will ever read them again when I know what a tragic ending it has. If I wanted to read a book with a sad and depressing ending I would start reading Nicholas Sparks books.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars until the last few chapters, the end gets 1.
B0030T0VA2|1.0|Daughter needed for a school diorama.  Too expensive for cheap plastic but I bought them anyway because my kids are spoiled and have no concept of the value of money.  Good quality and pretty cute.
B005LAIIS0|1.0|What a waste. Seems like Liam Neeson nowadays is doing movies only on the basis of how big the paycheck is. Between The Grey, Battleship, Taken 2, Clash of the Titans, and Wrath of the Titans, Neeson's been bombing in public more than the Taliban.<br /><br />The Grey in particular is a depressing stinker, and the 'Feel Bad Film' of the decade. Do not recommend, you'll be angry at yourself at the end of watching this movie over the two hours of your life you'll never get back.<br /><br />And Liam, Liam, Liam... please baby, stop whoring yourself out to bad movies. You're better than this.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|An addicting game.  Sometimes stuck on one level toooooooo long!!  Can be very frustrating.  Sometimes I'm tempted to just stop playing.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|\\"Spoilers\\".  I am so angry and let down, I am not sure where to begin.  I know there is not always a happy ending but this is straight ridiculous.  This was the end?  It was like the author had to get a third book out and just through words on paper.  I did not liek it going back and forth from Tris to Tobias as the chapters were long and I would forget whose point of view I was looking through.  There was no climax, there was only we will kill off all of these main characters,  hit this button, erase the bad, and life will go on.  If the author was going to make the ending totally unrealistic then there was no reason not to have a happy ending.  So I am supposed to buy that Evelyn and Marcus just let all they have been fighting for go??  Tobias just forgives and forgets??  Everyone just moves on and gets along?  This was a total let down.  At least in the Hunger games, good people died, but someone wound up happy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|loads of fun!!!  So Sweet, quick and easy game play, old school art, relieves stress, simple pleasure of crushing candy
B000002L68|5.0|Considering it came out before Cd's the sound quality is great. Rock out with Prince and remember the good ole days!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love it! Best series on television next to Downton Abby. Good filler until the next season of Downton Abby comes out.
1616550414|5.0|It's simple:<br /><br />- Are you a Zelda fan?<br /><br />BUY IT! It have artwork, history, biographies, manga, and more!<br /><br />Otherwise, don't waste your money in a book dedicated to a video games series that you don't even care.
006202406X|1.0|The whole book was just awful.  What a disappointment.  The ending was just one of many reasons why this book just ruined the whole series for me.  I loved the first two books and I REALLY wanted to love this book.  But it was simply awful from beginning to end.  I finished it a few days ago so I have let it sink in, and I have realized more and more how awful this book is.  I don't even think I can support the movies.  I'm annoyed at the 5-star reviewers who keep saying people are rating it poorly because \\"they don't get it\\" and \\"she was so brave\\".  I do get it.  Roth wanted to make a big statement and rushed through writing a book.  Her \\"statement\\" was so poorly executed that I don't see her as \\"brave\\", I see her as a bad writer.  I don't see myself ever re-entering the Divergent world or any other world Roth creates.
B000002H6C|4.0|After the passing of Cliff Burton, Metallica made the decision to carry on.  After recruiting bassist Jason Newsted and releasing a collection of covers called The Garage Days EP, Metallica entered the studio to embark on their most progressive effort yet.  Instead of having the insane thrash beats they doled out on Right The Lightning or Master Of Puppets, they moved over to the rock standard that Lars Ulrich's become known for since this album.  The songs were notably longer, with only two songs shorter than 6 minutes (none were less than 5) and two songs over the 9 minute mark.  The songs were also notably darker given their experience through having lost one of their band members in a violent manner.<br /><br />Nevertheless, many metal fans point to this being the lynchpin album of Metallica's career instead of their self-titled \\"Black\\" album because it introduced Metallica's musicianship to a larger audience.  The song \\"One\\" captured the listener's attention with the blistering double-bass drumming (Tama sales went through the roof after that) and the wailing guitar solos to go along with a terrifying music video.  Anyone who went on to purchase the album were likely bowled over with Blackened, Harvester of Sorrow, And Justice For All, and Eye of the Beholder (unless they were the stoney types who threw the horns up in Burton's memory during \\"To Live Is To Die.\\")  There aren't any weak moments on the album.  even now, it remains one of their best works.<br /><br />Why did I rank it 4.5 Stars Out Of Five?  Two reasons:<br /><br />1.  The production value will always be a controversy with this album.  The bass guitar is grossly under-produced; along with allegations that it was done to \\"haze\\" Newsted.<br /><br />2.  Metallica's career could have gone two ways after this album:<br /><br />a.  They held their sound.  The \\"Black\\" Album would have been a bit more artistic and exploration, but would have remained close to what it was.  Load wouldn't have worked to cater to the mainstream, but would have instead pushed more artistic boundaries.  Though they get older, Metallica goes on to be considered the Pink Floyd of a generation (to the dismay of every Tool fan in existence.)<br /><br />b.  The sound changes.  The \\"Black\\" Album starts to introduce elements of rock into a metal band's sound, which ultimately overtakes the sound as the band writes rock-oriented songs to maintain their credibility.  After an embarrassing PR-gaffe involving Napster, the band goes to release an \\"experimental\\" record during a time their personal lives and interpersonal relationships are so rife with acrimony that the bassist quits and the band's long-time producer is ultimately fired.  Though the band recovers enough to remain multi-platinum artists and release an album that's a spiritual successor of this one in [[ASIN:B00F3OLVR4 Death Magnetic]], they don't have the drawing power they used to have.<br /><br />(I think we all know how that turned out.)<br /><br />Be that as it may, this album's still a classic.  I wish it would've been a sign of things to come but that's just not how it worked out.  I recommend it to everyone.  If you're a fan of rock and metal and you haven't heard this yet, make this the next thing you listen to.
B008KE3960|4.0|Goes from easy to difficult, very playable.  My sons and I enjoy it.  Would recommend for good defense type game.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was flawed in many manyy ways.  The first two I thought were entertaining and I could not put them down until I devoured every page, and I expected this one to be much of the same. Boy, that couldn't be any further from the truth. I was bored. Bored. I Couldn't wait to just finish it.  Where was the action and excitement from the first? I felt like I kept waiting for it to start! I may have been able to look passed all of these flaws if I had my happy ending between four and tris, you know, the happily ever after that I've been waiting for throughout all three books. Did I get it? No. It was devastating. And for no reason! These are YA books, maybe you should be looking at who your audience is veronica Roth! The majority of the people want some type of happy ending, and if not that, at least something that makes sense!  This entire book from start to finish was pointless, it's almost as if she forgot the last two books!  I'm pretending this book never existed.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is an addicting game and, with the new update it is even more awesome/addicting. I highly recommend this game for anyone who is addicted to games like Dragon City. I think anyone (with enough patience) could enjoy this game.

1400031362|5.0|I read it because I am hooked on this series. I just love the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency!<br />I recommend it to anyone who wants a good read. My Book Club really enjoyed it too.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The author concentrates on the likely political motives of the historical (as opposed to the theological) Jesus. Much of it is speculative  because of the dearth of contemporary documentation concerning Jesus. Neverthe less, the analysis is reasonable based upon the large body of scholarly research available about first century CE Judea.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|A mixture of fact and fiction that brings to life the history of the early twentieth century. I was educated and entertained by the intertwining lives of the characters who came from different countries symbolizing the culture, politics and philosophy of the time.

0980876702|5.0|I don't know if any of you are familiar with Carolyn Pearce, or Inspirations Magazine. It's only been in the last two years that I have become aware being from the US, and them in Australia. The price you pay for any of the books or mags from them will never disappoint you. The book is wonderfully illustrated, with stellar instructions and many projects that I am anxious to do.

B002VPE1WK|2.0|This pack is MUCH smaller that I had anticipated. It is well designed, with lots of movable dividers on the inside. However, with all of my camera gear packed in it (SLR body, 2 lenses, filters, chargers, mini-tripod, etc), I did not feel like my gear was actually well protected.<br /><br />Even though it does hold my gear, there is no room for anything else. Also, it is VERY small -- deep but short. It looks like I'm using a toddler's backpack. It is a smaller backpack that my young children's backpacks. As a result, it looks funny when I wear it -- like a turtle hump (I'm 5'8, broad shoulders). Also, I didn't like that I didn't have space for carrying other random things (like snacks, etc) even though I'd now be walking around on special family outings with a backpack.<br /><br />I ended up returning this backpack, and getting [[ASIN:B009XJYYB0 Professional Gear Backpack for Digital SLR Canon Cameras, up to 17\\" Laptops... by Accessory Genie]]. That backpack is also small (about the same width as this one), but the extra height and pocket on top is helpful. I also like the side zipper access so that I can get to the camera without having to take the backpack off, and that I can stick a large bounce in the back pocket (the \\"laptop pocket\\").<br /><br />I'm still on the lookout for a slightly wider and padded hard shell backpack, but in the meantime I'd recommend that Accessory Genie backpack over this one.

The movies is enjoyable, I would give it a \\"all-right\\" because rooting for man against....,can't be helped, and the team play lesson that is a great message.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|so I finally had to check out what all the hype is on this game... and of course I am terribly addicted!  its a great game but since I don't play on facebook I can run out of lives too quickly... and I don't think it should be so limited and definitely not cost 99 cents for new lives!  so I am also frustrated by the game.  too addicting not to be free.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I read this book while on vacation in Germany, because it was about a kid with cancer I figured it would maybe make me a little sad depending on what all happened but let me tell you I bawled and bawled through parts of this book!

1576875776|5.0|This book is a gem with wonderful, raw pictures taken by a woman who never intended for her work to be seen by anyone, let alone published. I loved learning all about Miss Maier and her seemly&#34; Ordinary&#34;  life, but her legacy will live forever through the extraordinary stories she tells without a single word, just her amazing photos she took. Love it.
1592402038|4.0|For the amount of reading that I did for the book (in correlation to an \\"in class assignment\\"), it was amazing to me how engaged I was in reading a book on punctuation and grammar. Having read \\"The Elements of Style\\" last year for my freshmen seminar class, I found it interesting having a work to compare it to. That being said, I would heave to say I preferred this book better. The section on commas was most enlightening to me personally because my improper comma use seems to be an epidemic in my writing, so that section in particular was very easy to understand and easy to conceptualize in my own way. Great read and very engaging.
076115678X|4.0|This book pleasantly surprised me, It is quite informative and resourceful. Though the author is one of the creators of the curly friendly hairline devacurl, she didn't just promote her haircare line; on the contrary, she informs non-straight haired ladies how to care for their hair based on certain characteristics and the use of natural products.

B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|I knew when I installed this app that it was a free app in which you could purchace things. But the upgrade costs ten dollars that is slightly overpriced.

0385334206|3.0|Kurt Vonnegut warned the reader in the name of Philboyd Studge that he made his living being impolite about American history and national heroes.  He released Breakfast of Champions during our long national nightmare, when the Watergate investigations had taken a toll on the confidence of the average American.  Americans did not expect that their children would have a better life when their children reached adulthood.<br /><br />The American dollar had plummeted after a decade of paying for the Vietnam War and the social programs of the great society left America in a deep national debt.  Yet American manufacturing was not poised to take advantage of low prices for American goods abroad because its costs were still high.  The biggest input for manufactured goods, energy, was imported, expensive, and increasing in cost as America had no counter for the oil embargo by OPEC nations.  The American economy had high unemployment, high inflation, and no answers.<br /><br />As the novel says, the planet was being destroyed by manufacturing processes, and what was being manufactured was lousy, by and large.<br /><br />The author tells the story in his own unique way, which he describes in Chapter 19.  Every person is an important as the other.  All facts would be given equal weight.  Nothing would be left out.  Let others bring order to chaos; I will bring chaos to order.<br /><br />Trying to imitate his style is difficult, because nobody quite has the experiences, style, and chemicals of Vonnegut.  The author also included many drawings to accompany the text in the novel.  Despite the fact that they are depicted in black and white, the drawings add color to the novel.  One of the pictures is a drawing of the American flag.  This is the same flag that the baseball player Rick Monday rescued from protesters who tried to burn an American flag at a baseball game at Dodger Stadium.  Rick Monday is also known for hitting the game-winning home run in Game Five of the NLCS in 1981,which advanced the Dodgers to the World Series over the Montreal Expos.  The game is called the Blue Monday game, which is incidentally the alternate title of this novel.  Such tangential, circular thoughts are a staple of Vonnegut's storytelling style.<br /><br />Vonnegut makes references to real characters that he knows, and characters from other novels.  His grandfather Al Lieber plays a bit role in this story as does a former maid of his family, Mary Young.  The paint and varnish company could be any O'Hare, but Vonnegut's war buddy who is a large part of Slaughterhouse-Five did live in Hellertown, PA.  Jon Sparks and Warren Stockmayer are real people.  Rosewater and Karabekian are major characters from other novels; Trout is common recurring character, while Francine Pefko and Wayne Hoobler have small roles in other stories.  It is easy to get jumbled in the world of Vonnegut with his recurring themes and characters.<br /><br />Breakfast of Champions is a reminder of the dark times of the 1970s. Two often-cited images of that bleakness are 1) A picture of the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland on fire, and 2) The New York Post headline `Ford to City: Drop Dead.'  Vonnegut states the former and describes the dangerous, drug-infested, porn-parlor that 42nd Street used to be when New York City declared bankruptcy.  Today, the Cayuhoda is cleaned-up and Times Square is Disneyfied but the subprime mortgage meltdown of 2008 is America's latest financial crisis.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Neat game! Is my 8 yr old son's favorite in the angry bird series. We play together some and I like it too!
1439199396|5.0|I found this a fascinating read. The author tells a good story and has clearly done a ton of research on autoimmune issues, a topic of great interest to many of us these days. It's easy to pick up and put down, plus some chapters are more relevant to my info needs, so I found it a good airplane book. I look forward to more articles and books by Velasquez-Manoff.
B001OMJGD0|5.0|Good family movie and introduction of Superman to kids.  My 8 yr old son loved it! I thought this actor was as good as the original!

B008GXHOFW|5.0|My son loves this game! Could play for hours if I allowed. He gets to some of the higher levels, but doesn't reach all the points that I have read that some adults do. This takes up a huge amount of space, even on the latest Kindle. Bargained to get rid of some of the other games he didn't play anymore and put them in the cloud.  We share the Kindle, I don't want him having one of his own yet. Even some of my apps had to go to the cloud. Just don't like how large this is. Will be glad when he out grows it! :)

B000W178XO|1.0|The album as shown prior to my purchase showed 21 songs, the new black cloud download system would not let me download the entire album, it was automatically downloaded prior to your new system. I was only able to download 16 songs, even after I purchased 21!  I tried 4 times to download the album, but the only thing I got was 4 copies of the 16 songs which I had to delete 3 copies from my Itunes!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game ever I didn't play it until my brother showed me and they just added this for the kindle fire and I'm so glad  it's free. The game gets harder and I've been stuck on level 20 for a couple weeks but you can either buy or wait for lives. They also have so many levels!!! I suggest getting this game :)

B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book ruined the entire series for me. I was completely disappointed. I was excited about the movie coming out too, but I'm going to skip that now as well. Dream up your own ending to the series instead.
B0024CEY36|5.0|I like 'reading about that time period. I was brought to a good ending with a steady build up. I have loved every book Fillet has written and looking forward to starting the next book.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love this show!  Have read all the books, and am pleased with the HBO series -- even with the changes they've made.  Can't wait to see how it ends!  I recommend this series to everyone (16 or older).
B00A3XQVKW|5.0|I love this book.  I love how it ...well, feels right.  Besides just being interesting, it gives me comfort as I miss dear ones who've left already.  And Betty is just so real!
B005NAE04E|3.0|This was an enjoyable adventure in London Underground that reminded me of some of Enid Blyton's more fantastical tales.  It didn't entirely satisfy - not like Stardust - but it was only two steps away.  Highly recommended for anyone who knows the London Tube map off by heart.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|For anyone that hasn't seen Into Darkness it really is a great movie. But for Star Trek fans that will get some of the references to the original series, it is the greatest of all Star Trek movies. JJ Abrams did a great job with the first foray into the Star Trek genre but this was a masterpiece. I thought Benedict Cumberbatch was an outstanding villain (ahem!) and the Enterprise crew really took a step forward in their performances from the first movie. Keep 'em coming!<br /><br />As for the Blue-ray itself, I had no problems and the picture is just stunning. I don't get to the movies often but saw the movie twice in 3-D in the theater - it was that good - but this Blu-ray was really outstanding for home viewing. The other day my wife and I (exhausted from raising an infant and toddler) planned to watch only the first 45 minutes after putting the kids to bed. We ended up watching the whole movie instead - it just pulls you in and is a joy to experience. There are very few movies I &#34;can't turn off&#34; but this is one of them. Enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|E. L. James' &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34; is a novel of erotica and romance.  The Twilight influence is easy to spot, though these two series are nothing alike.<br /><br />Anastasia falls for the rich and handsome Christian Grey, who seems to be just as smitten with her.  Her wavering decision over whether or not to spend time in his playroom is the only thing that stands in their way.<br /><br />This novel is a good selection if you're interested in reading erotica, since the hot scenes really are the core of this book.<br /><br />As a romance, it falls short.  The main things I didn't like were the lagging beginning and the abrupt, less than satisfying ending. It seemed to me that the romantic elements were only used as filler around the erotic scenes.  The thing that annoyed me most involved the stupid contract, written out in full a few times as more filler.  She will sign, she won't, she decides to sign, then he tells her to wait, blah, blah, back and forth, even though she's already doing everything the stupid contract outlines.<br /><br />That said, the steamy parts do a wonderful job of holding the readers' attention, but I'd only recommend this book to readers of erotica.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|about time!  tons of fun.  gets harder the farther you get. costs money for additional items but stick with it and you will get it eventually.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|although stream quality wad not as good even though i paid for HD. It was still a decent movie but not worth the money for HD
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I recommended this to my book club and nearly all loved it!  It is both gruesome and gritty but completely compelling.  I am always interested in other countries and their culture and this gives one a novel sized view of N Korea and the demands on its people......where are the squad of people who monitor human rights????
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I am a big fan of Jeremy Renner he is great I tell all my kid and grandkids to watch his movies
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This books makes one a believer in karma.....what goes around, comes around!  It was a well written story.  I enjoyed!!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|My daughter could not wait to play this game and all it does is crash! The entire Kindle crashes! Please fix!
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|This book is a reminder that even with the choice to sincerely pursue a spiritual path, you will not avoid the not so happy experiences in this dream of time and space. It's a wake up call, every pun intended. Still, remember the goal.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|This is a great little app for all ages. The fire truck must put out the fires and move obstacles before it's water runs out. Controls are simple and easy to understand. The challenges do get harder as the game progresses, but never seem to become frustratingly difficult.<br />Overall a well deserved 5 stars.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I do not want to spoil this book for other so all I will say is that I was very disappointed with the ending.  I understand the desire of the author to send an important life message but I think she forgot that people also read for the joy of traveling through a new world.
B008TZ87LW|3.0|You'll find reviews elsewhere on Amazon for \\"Mommy\\" (1995), the \\"'unofficial' sequel to THE BAD SEED (1956)\\", and Mommy 2: Mommy's Day (1997).  This two-in-one pack contains both films (Mommy and Mommy2), as well as a generous assortment of extras and bonus material: feature-length commentaries, bloopers, interviews, a making-of documentary.  If you're a fan of Max Allan Collins or the other releases from Neo Noir, this harder-to-find combo pack may be a good way to pick up both films and all the extras at once.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Excellent quality. Love this show. Downloaded quick. But make sure you have a good strong wifi connection or else it will not download right away.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I am so glad that more of Dr. Seuss' books are being turned into movies.  I have always been a fan of Dr. Seuss and the &#34;Lorax&#34; is another winner.  Thanks for being so creative!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed the writing of this book. All the angles are explored in each of the characters lives. I would be interested in more books by this author.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|My kid like it.  It's fun for him.  He spend good time on it.  One suggestion would be to make it more interactive.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is so much fun, but I wonder if there is any way to skip a level once it is clear you are stuck?
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|We really enjoyed the Avengers Movie.  Good action scenes and some good humor too!  Fun to see the combination of Action Hero's work together for the common goal.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|I just purchased a 60\\" Samsung smart TV, so I wanted to watch a movie that really flexed the capability of my new TV.  I knew the critics panned this movie, but I hadn't seen it so I gave it a watch.  The movie has great special effects, was entertaining, corny, and painfully predictable.  BUT, if you are a sci-fi genre fan, and have a uber TV and sound system, this movie is definitely worth a watch.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am so let down and disappointed by this sorry excuse of a novel, I dont have enough words to describe. So for those that feel the same I have made a pitition to have the book rewritten and or altered.  If you dont agree then disregard this review and if you do agree go and sign! I will keep it on as long as needed to get my message across to not only Veronica Roth but to her publishers and editors as well. Thank you fellow fans. Your reviews gave me the courage to do this. Lets see what happens.  P.s. here is the website where you can comment and review and SIGN!  [...]
B003Z0BWT0|4.0|Characters, loves and friendships and are well developed with a thrilling build-up of excitement. in a nicely defined fantasy world where really evil characters create an interesting plot
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I love this album with twelve freshly composed pieces!  Lindsey Stirling really has a VERY American style, and I love it very much.  I feel her skill and talent is very close to Gil Shaham, Hilary Hahn, and Anne-Sophie Mutter.  However, her creativity and musical ingenuity is equivalent to Philip Glass.  The album is an excellent investment and goes well with any music collection.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Most recommended for kids and for people that like constructive games. For people like me<br />(1) will download these type of games as quickly as possible<br />(2) have a heart for this kind of game<br /> I give it five stars
B0036S4B6M|1.0|Maybe it's because I watched the show first but this book is pretty boring. Also, the author went out of her way to say the inmates are all nice people who help each other out. That just seems unbelievable to me.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I am reading this book now, the last of Nicholas Sparks I have read.  Keep on writing beautiful stories.  I love them.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was suggested to me if I enjoyed one book, The Silent Wife, that I would enjoy this one. That proved to be true. Different situations but a mystery with a twist.
B008S80PCE|5.0|Bill is a legend in the music industry. Great buy and price.Well worth it.Not to mention it came on time from these buyers.
B0063IH60K|3.0|got free but you have to buy any other form of game i want just to play for enjoyment<br />just want some games to put on new kindle
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i love this game it's a lot like my other fav. game. the graphics are superb... the mini games are kool and the friends section is really great ... the in app purchase is not really required to play so that makes it a plus in my book... and the offline play is just as equally fun... although the expansion of land is a little costly.. but to only have one setback really says alot for the game ... me and my wife are so into this game that we are trying to see who can stay a level up on each other... in short this game gets 4 stars from me... try it  ... you will  not regret it ...  :-)
B009NH6JRE|5.0|The Walking Dead is a show that you don't have to be a zombie/undead fan to enjoy, because it's about alot more than just zombies.  Just about all aspects about surviving in a post-apocayptic world with no government, law, or even mass electricity sources  are shown and covered, but you do need a strong stomach to watch!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing Candy Crush on my Kindle!  Thank goodness I have a limited number of lives or I would play for hours.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Awesome buy, it was a gift . It seemed impossible to find. Sold out everywhere once I found it on amazon I was delight and once the birthday boy opened his gift the smile was priceless it's a great gift!
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|although it's not stage version that I want, still worth it !! Andrew Webber's musical definitely can be your collection.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I actually read &#34;Gone Girl&#34; first and really loved it.  But this book was absolutely just as fantastic.  Gillian Flynn knows how to write a good story.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I thought I would be the curmudgeon saying that I was disappointed in this book - but I see from the other reviews that I am not the only one. My take is a little different though, I couldn't get into the book at all - it wasn't until the last 15% that I got interested, and I actually liked the way it ended - I thought the ending was appropriate to the characters of Tris and Tobias. I thought that the reason I had such a hard time getting into the book was because it had been some time since I read Insurgent, and although the main characters were clear in my mind, I was having a hard time placing the other characters (I actually resorted to Wikipedia for a synopsis of Insurgent).<br /><br />It seems like Roth came up with the ending and then just rushed a story by rote so that she could get to the ending. I think having the story told by only Tris (until the epilogue) would have been more effective. Maybe Veronica Roth should have spent less time being a celebrity and a more time being a writer . . .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and so glad it's finally on the kindle fire. :) I've been playing it non stop since I finally found it. Fun game and very addictive!! Recommended for all ages. :)
B001I45UFC|5.0|These are some of the best stories I have read after seeing the series many years ago on PBS I had to check out the books for my Kindle and was not disappointed C.S. Lewis is one of the best in this kindred spirit story telling.
B00006879E|5.0|I love Maroon 5 and Adam Levine.  All the songs on the cd are wonderful.  Can't wait to get more from Maroon 5.
0525478817|5.0|If you can't decide whether you want a good laugh or a good cry, this is the book for you.
B00G32OMF8|4.0|If you are invested in the characters and enjoyed the romance of their first meeting and the eventual reunion, it's quite interesting and satisfying to see how their relationship evolves. This is the happily ever but it's not so happy. Now the two have a real life partnership with children, memories, resentments, fears, failures, triumphs, and all the indecision and pain that life can bring. What emerges is a true portrait of what it means for these two people to be together. If it were not inevitable, it would be impossible.
006202406X|3.0|This review and more can be found on my blog, The Library Canary: [...]    I’ve been waiting for this book for so long. We’ve all been waiting for this book for so long. When it arrived at my house on Tuesday, I practically ran to the door and ripped the box out of the delivery guy’s hands. I danced around my living room with it like an idiot. Then I started reading. And I realized that we got to read from Four’s perspective! I don’t know how I didn’t know this, but I didn’t. I was pumped. I love multiple POVs and I’ve wanted to get inside Four’s head for a while. (I haven’t read any of the novellas yet.)    Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the shifting POVs. Four’s voice wasn’t very distinct. I found myself forgetting that I was reading from his perspective. Then, when he would say something like “Tris said”, it would jar me. His voice and Tris’s just sounded so similar. They are such different people that it shouldn’t have been like this. I understand why Veronica Roth chose to write from both perspectives. It was necessary to the story, but it could have been done a lot better. In addition, I kind of felt like Four turned into a wimp in this book. And maybe it’s because we were in his head, but I just always saw him as this super strong character and in this book I saw an insecure child. He lost some of his swoon-factor for me.    I have been dying to know what’s outside the city for a year now. Then I found out and it was like a slowly deflating balloon. So disappointing. I thought it was kind of lame. Not exciting at all. Just more typical dystopian novel stuff. This book was a lot slower paced than the first two. At times I felt like the plot was dragging. I think if what had been outside the city was….cooler?….the plot would have moved a lot faster. But it didn’t. And I was sad.    Tris and Four still hadn’t worked their crap out in this book. I wanted them to be together, truly be together for the majority ofthis book. And they weren’t. They were still constantly bickering and arguing. I miss their relationship from Divergent. That being said, the times that they were together in this book were magical and had me crying and squealing.    “I fell in love with him. But I don’t just stay with him by default as if there’s no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.” –Tris    I love Tris so much. She's so smart and so brave and she's come so far throughout this trilogy. She's one of the most kick-ass characters I've ever read about. Every book she has learned something new and this one is no exception. I just wish that Four would listen to her!!!    Four on the other hand, seemed to go backwards in this book. He didn't seem like he learned anything and he almost seemed to get careless. I felt like he didn't develop at all in this book. Maybe he just didn’t develop the way I wanted him to. I don’t even know. I’m so confused over my feelings for this book. I was really happy that Four got some closure with his parents though. His relationships with both his mom and his dad were really complicated and he was able to deal with them in this book.    If you haven’t read it yet, prepare yourselves. Not everybody makes it out. Veronica Roth was not afraid to kill her characters. And I approved. Sad as it was (I cried so many tears), I admire the fact that she took the risk. This is a dystopian society. The city of Chicago is extremely unsettled. War is brewing between faction supporters and the factionless. Death is part of war and Roth doesn’t let us forget.    I’ve been trying to figure out how to rate this book since I started writing this review. I just don’t know. I didn’t hate it. Everybody is in an uproar over the ending. The ending shocked me. I never saw it coming, but I understood it. And I felt like, had I opened my eyes throughout the whole series, I would have seen it coming. So I really didn’t hate the book. But I didn’t really enjoy it either. At least not like I enjoyed the first two books. So how do I rate this?    Veronica Roth did tie everything up nicely. I didn’t have any unanswered questions. She closed it up enough that we knew where all the characters were, but also left the world open enough that we’re not sure exactly what was going to happen in the future. It was the perfect combination.    “Sometimes it [bravery] is nothing more than gritting your teeth through the pain, and the work of every day, the slow walk toward a better life.” –Four    The writing was beautiful. I will give Veronica Roth that. There are so many sticky notes in my copy. It’s crazy how many lines I marked. There were lots of feels in this book about many different things. I pretty much cried the whole time reading. My heart is broken. My soul is broken. I feel empty. But, I think I’m going to give it a solid 3 stars. Obviously you should read this book. Especially if you’ve already read Divergent and Insurgent. Even if you haven’t, you should read this series. It’s a great series with lots of lessons learned and some awesome kick-ass characters. I guess I just expected more out of this conclusion and I didn’t get it. Happy reading all!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I wanted to see this movie when it came out, but somehow it never happened. I rented it from Amazon the other day (SO CONVENIENT!) and LOVED it. Adorable. Hilarious. Heartwarming. Highly-recommended.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|We liked the movie very much.  Kept our attention the whole time.  A lot of action, it was a good story.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to use, has all my books, works just like a Kindle, but smaller and in my pocket. I love Kindle. I own several and will buy a new one when (if) I wear mine out. The app works great!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is my favorite of the 5 books (so far) in the series. I love all the scenes with Jaime and Brienne (this book made Jaime one of my absolute fav characters, along with Daenerys and Tyrion). And of course the brilliant and shocking &#34;Red Wedding&#34; which took everyone by surprise (and also took the show viewers who hadn't read this book by surprise in episode 9 of Game of Thrones this season). I almost threw my book across the room after reading it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep is a great follow up to The Shining, but you don't necessarily have to read The Shining first. Overall, I enjoyed it very much. Love those King novels...keep 'em coming!
B004I744AS|5.0|Found it useful for my college classes and daily life. Helpful for papers and resumes. Good tool in your arsenal.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|This was a great movie, a little weird seeing Michael Douglas and Matt Damon doing the &#34;gay&#34; thing, but fabulous acting on both parts - even Rob Lowe as the plastic surgeon.  Watched it once with my boyfriend, now planning a movie party with some of my lady friends.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love it. My son broke my first tablet but because of this app. All my books were stored in amazon. I could upload them again. All was not lost.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|Love gangster movies and this is at the top of my list.  Great acting by all of the stars.  A must see if you like mobsters.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Nice try, it was OK.  But Jaden might try taking some more acting lessons.  Just a little thin on the emoting.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I enjoyed reading all three books in this series and enjoyed the growth of the characters throughout the series.  I am not surprised at the negative reviews for Allegiant since most people have a prescribed view of how a so-called YA dystopian romance book series should be concluded.  However, I do believe that it is unjust to criticize the author's development of the characters and  her writing skill.  While she maybe a relatively new author, she excels in intricate and insightful weaving of the nature and personality of each character and their inter-relationships with one another.  She took a risk and created a fitting ending to the story she had conceived  (Please remember that while we have come to love the story and the characters, she has breathed life into them and made them so life-like that we the readers care a great deal about what happens to them as evidenced by the large number of angry reviews posted on Amazon).  I hope that if you are new to this series that you will take the opportunity to make up your own mind and not be a part of the herd.  The Divergent series was a thought provoking journey from start to finish.  I will be thinking about these characters and the decisions they made long after having read these books and trying to be as brave, selfless and forgiving as Tris and Tobias.
030758836X|4.0|I found this book fascinating! Every time I thought I knew what was going to happen. I could not have been more wrong.  I read many complaints about the ending from reviewers who loved the book but hated the way it ended.After reading it, I can't see it ending any other way.  I couldn't put it down from the minute I started it. Read and judge for yourself
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy Amazon finally got the candy crush app I'm finally able to play it!! It works great keep up the good work!!
B00F91G5BS|2.0|I fell asleep twice trying to watch this.  Lots of cool special effects but not enough of a story to hold my interest.
1416550550|5.0|This author successfully interwove many stories into one novel with a common ending. Through use of different yet realistic settings and time periods, the reader can truly feel that the story took place while always wanting to read or learn more about the unique characters.<br /><br />The theme certainly suits all readers who enjoy well developed characters with a bit of romance as well as controversy. However, to fully enjoy this novel, the reader must have the ability to grasp fore-shadowing and hidden meanings. By reading this book a second time, I uncovered an even thicker plot.<br /><br />Excellent book.

B00DGGIXS6|5.0|This is my new favorite Cher CD.  I sing along to each track when I'm in the car and on my Kindle Fire. I haven't seen her in person since her 2004 Farewell Tour and can't wait for her to tour again.  My favorites are Woman's World and I Hope You Find It, but it's like picking your favorite child...I love them all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun. I can play it for hours on end. Best game since Temple Run© I wouldn't pay for any boosts because that's not in me. But it was still a very good game.

B00FN811SY|3.0|Scroll down to 'Recent discussions in the JW Library forum'<br /><br />I posted instructions where to find the .apk file to sideload the app in:<br />jw library - kindle, fire hd<br />JW.Org Library<br /><br />The app does not include an exit button (I use another app to 'force stop' & exit).  Also, the links located in the Introduction & Appendix tabs are wonderful but if you want to access another link towards the bottom of the list you have to keep scrolling down to get to it.  I'm hoping this will be resolved in a future update.<br /><br />For me the app is 4.5 stars, but Amazon gets 3 stars because I had to search elsewhere to sideload it to my KFHD.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The best Grisham since A Time To Kill!  It made me feel like all the problems this world has can be solved, If people could only come together and put their differences aside!  He has a way of shedding light on dark issues and still coming away with a good feeling in the end.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|fun but addictive great colors and cool animation. it took me a long time to start playing but im glad i did. good way to pass the time

B00D2I8E46|5.0|Let's get one thing straight from the beginning: Contrary to what one reviewer, who gave this new CD only two stars wrote, this is not an album of \\"mostly reworked old E.C.songs\\".  He borrows a line or two from Pills & Soap and maybe two other songs, but places them in completely different contexts. The result being an original work  - No make that a STUNNINGLY Original work. Costello's wordplay and verbiage is the best it's been in years as he takes us down some lyrically original paths. Is it rock, soul, hip-hop, Classically influenced pop, or reggae? - and the answer is all of the above. It's fairly complex, but it's Costello's best work in years. Questlove takes some co-writing credits, but is content to stay in the background in support of Costello. Some of the final touches he gives some of the songs with backing vocals or as a co-producer takes the CD in original directions, that would have been unlikely in a Costello recording with The Attractions or The Imposters.<br />I'd also recommend that fans buy the expanded version of Wise Up Ghost which contains 15 songs, instead of the standard version's 12 songs. The three extra songs dovetail perfectly with the standard version's 12, like it was meant to be a 15 song album all along. Take my word for it and pay the extra couple of bucks for the extra three songs. They are well worth it. It's a lenghty album, so make time in your schedule to give the extended version a seriously focused listening. (Extended version running time is approximately One Hour & 10 Minutes).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Some of the stops are really hard.  I just about quit on one of them, but I would not do one for 1 or two months........ no w a y.  But I really like this game.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|This season so far has ben good, but not holy crap what is happening next good. I am a little disappointed but then again we are only on episode 2.

0753513382|3.0|I started reading it, but it failed to really grab my attention so I moved on to Freakonomics instead. Personally, I felt that Freakonomics was much more interesting, but to each their own I suppose.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|ALL OF Grishams books are good but this is a spellbinding.  Could not put this one down until it was finished.

B004SIP9RO|5.0|I had this movie in VHS format, and recently bought it on DVD. I love this movie! It has a fun storyline and I enjoy watching both Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack interact. Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon (as the best friends) and Eugene Levy (as as Bloomingdale's salesman) are a hoot. This is a classic pick for romantic comedy fans.

B00EKQ3YZI|3.0|A lot of people don't know that Donna Summer recorded different types of music genres such as R&B, Pop, Urban, Jazz, Rock, Soul, etc.  She won 5 Grammy's in 5 different music categories.  Summer earned  her Crown as the very first  Dance Queen, yes before Madonna did.  So the Mixes projects was something missing in her music legacy.  It's finally here... Besides ' Love to Love you' and ' Love is in Control' the rest of the Mixes couldn't keep up the fun energy from the original recording.  Most of the Remixes are dull and lack of dance energy.  I got this album for my collection but I rather to listen her classics songs version instead. My rating is a big C-
B0082RHRHC|5.0|This shows human struggles. She survives a harsh childhood  and developes a strong perceptive character.  Her moral and religious values consistently guide her.

B00A2H9X6I|5.0|Let's just start by fending off the critics who just troll for things to criticize.  This is a remake of the 1976 film based on Stephen King's first novel.  Because the original was powerful an remains effective to this day, some may argue that this is a remake that has no business being made.  I thought that about the 2011 remake (which they claimed was a prequel) The Thing (2011).  However, unlike The Thing, Carrie was remade impressively, honors the original and brings all of the quality to a present day audience that may have never given the time of day to the 36 year old original.<br /><br />Carrie White (Chloë Grace Moretz; Dark Shadows, Let Me In, The Eye, The Amityville Horror) is an awkward, sheltered, God-fearing 18-year old living with her fanatical zealot of a mother (Julianne Moore; Seventh Son, 6 Souls).  She develops telekinetic powers after being humiliated at school as she comes of age (physiologically).  As a result of her humiliating trauma, she becomes the subject of attention of some clique-y, over-entitled &#34;it&#34; girls leading to a cruel prank that gets way out of hand when after Carrie is asked to prom by a popular boy, they are crowned king and queen of the prom, and Carrie has the time of her life.<br /><br />The changes from the original were few in this remake.  But the major accomplishment here was modernizing a classic while preserving legendary acting performances with current actors.  Everyone seemed to do a solid job.  Carrie's classmates were vicious, with a cruelty credibly fueled by entitlement.  Chloë Grace Moretz was impressive, instantly capturing my greatest sympathies.  And Julianne Moore made me shutter almost every time I saw her face; hauntingly insane, often psychotic.  Moore commands most of our nervous attention until the prom scene, when Chloë Grace Moretz shifts gears from great to amazing!<br /><br />At this point I'd like to pause and address a non-horror victory.  The prom scene was enchanting.  They did such a great job making Carrie's date seem sweet and attentive.  For about ten minutes we see Carrie coming of age mentally as a beautiful, somewhat confident woman.  She makes friends, has her first dance, enjoys her first embrace from a boy, and feels safe and cared for perhaps for the first time in her life.  I almost wanted the movie to have a happy ending.  No, they really did that good of a job making this scene, well…just so…touching!  It reminded me of my prom and simultaneously made me think &#34;if I should ever have a daughter I hope she has a prom experience like this.&#34;<br /><br />Well, not entirely like this. This effectively sweet and tender scene primes us for what we all know happens next.  The messy prom finale.  It's impressive.  Carrie exacts her rage on her classmates to gory ends, sparing the few she knows to be innocent but indiscriminately rending all others.  Her face mixes horror, revenge and, at moments, a karmically reciprocal satisfaction.  The scale is large, the revenge is sweet, and the ending is appropriately sad.  Although, the final few minutes felt forced.<br /><br />If I had a criticism it would be that Carrie's telekinesis comes out of nowhere.  It may have justifiably emerged after a traumatic event, but how did this not happen before in her four years of high school or a lifetime with her incredibly psychologically abusive mother?  She also seems to master the power to levels of shocking acuity, which diminishes the frightening rage-like abandon with which she wields her powers in the prom scene.  It seems equal parts meltdown and calculated, instead of entirely meltdown.<br /><br />But largely this film was AMAZING.  This remake is not only worthy, but a must-see which should stoke young horror fans' interest in the original.ch a great job making Carrie's date seem sweet and attentive.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Addicting? Definitely yes!  Even when you get through the game, you want to go back and beat your own scores.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I've just finished reading the casual vacancy and I really enjoyed it. It is sad and traffic and not remotely Harry potter, but there is real depth and character development. The story is good. It's not epic or anything, just honest. I don't know that I would recommend it too everyone, but not every book is for everyone. I just know I enjoyed the emotional response this book caused.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This book gives a unique look inside another culture and puts a human face on the problems in Afghanistan. It is also a thoroughly good read, as it follows the lives of those who have left the country and those who stayed behind. The way their lives are linked makes for a fascinating plot.  I recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed previous books by this author.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I ordered one of these to keep my blades sharp and it works great! It's nice to be able to sharpen my knives in the kitchen and my pocket knives too. I like how it's shaped just right for your hand and it quickly brings a dull blade back to life again like new.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is so fun game man I am telling you I am also good at this game and good for my kindle fire
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you're thinking of writing a book or short story, then this is a must-read for a beginner of Kindle files for Amazon. This little book is packed full of information if you're thinking of writing ebooks for Kindle; proper formats, proper ways to insert pictures and page formatting.
0199535531|5.0|I'm not going to tell you what I think of the book, I imagine if you're here, you're a Jane Austen fan already and/or you're capable of reading the summary. :)<br />This is a nice edition, you get the standard summary of her life, and lots of analysis and such, but I found the explanatory notes in this version particularly helpful. I've read Austen's six major works multiple times, so I don't need a definition of a chaise-four or an entailed estate anymore, but this edition managed to tell me things I hadn't heard yet.<br />Just because I have to: I originally liked MP the fourth best of Austen, but it has really grown on me...<br />Highly recommend.
B00COCY67A|5.0|Elvis At Stax is shot with feeling, from heartbreaking ballads, adult nature and loss. The time is 1973 and the years behind him have been filled with trying to mask the pain that is growing inside of him due to his divorce; from the &#34;Elvis on Tour&#34; documentary, the &#34;Aloha from Hawaii&#34; special, and the recordings of a new gospel and Christmas albums.  These sessions allowed him to put his pain into his songs and it works.  You can feel the soul he poors into these sessions, revealing a man with a profound sense of lost love and a look into his personal struggles.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|formato de libro con las cuatro peliculas y dos discos de extras, el idioma no es castellano sino español latino, una muy buena edicion.
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|Like many of the BBC works this one keeps You hooked, great production, Ian Richardson's performance excellent.<br />I have not seen the american version, so I couldn't possibly comment ...<br />Update Feb 2014: Now I have seen the american versi&oacute;n (season 1), and It sure is the american way. It is just some entertaintment to me, enough with season 1, I am not buying more seasons.<br />I will be watching the BBC version again.
006202406X|2.0|I don't even know where to start. The ending to this series is so ridiculously unrealistic. So many things do not make sense, there are major holes in the plot and even the characters were unlikeable. I understand that this is a YA book, but I honestly can't get behind how these teenagers can outsmart the adults unless they are in cohorts with Scooby Do.<br />I was bugged by the unnecessary \\"kissing\\" scenes that I do not want my daughter reading. Why can't these YA authors put in light kissing without putting hands in people's clothing and insinuate heavy petting! Major bug when it comes to these YA books that I have to tell my daughter she can't read. Still debating if ill let her read this one. (Btw-she is all but 12)<br />I loved the first 2 books in this series and can't say how disappointed I am by this one. Bah!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love them and def will buy again from them it is a little to big but I'm going to stuff them and see if it works lol

B00881VLCE|4.0|is very good and easy to play, all was and not if I did well and you do not have the picture again or in some corner of what others recommend.

B0024Y9EYS|3.0|It's a bit slow in pace, but so far, &#34;it's just been ok&#34;. I'll watch more episodes to see if this changes, if that's the case, I'll come up and update my review.

B0099RFVXQ|5.0|So if you think seeing Ironman flying and kicking butt is like Christmas... then this movie is like 3 Christmases all happening together (Ironman, Thor, and Cap. USA!). Then the icing on the cake of course is Black Widow, which is basically like 3 Christmases plus a Thanksgiving. I know the analogy is weird, but that's how I felt!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a fun game to play. Some levels are extremely difficult. Keep up the good work. Need more games like this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy playing this game as every level is different and some more challenging than others, if I have spare time in the day I play a game, lots of my friends play as well.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Everyone has been talking about Candy Crush and I was anxious to see what was so great about it.  NOTHING.  It's ok but not my favorite game.  Bejeweled 2 is much better.  Sorry Candy Crush fans.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Hard to find new good books... way. This book is SO good it'll make other books look bad. I will so read the next book... \\"The Titan 's Curse\\", I think. Rick Riordan is so on my top-favorite-best-authors list. SPOILER!!! It is not Ares who betrays Percy... guess who he is. Wanna know? It's Luke. Not-spoiler... I SOOOOOO wish that gods and goddesses and demigods where real and I SOOOOOOO wish I were one. Have fun reading!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What an amazing read... Definitely inspiring in  a way. And worth every minute of reading. I will be definitely reading it again :-)
1579655327|2.0|When I buy a cookbook, I expect it to be about food, contain dependable recipes and perhaps some interesting stories. This unfortunately does not meet my criteria. Basically a picture book of hipster fluff, I was disappointed in the lack of quality writing and felt the errors and omissions in several of the recipes very amateurish.<br /><br />And let me be clear: I'm an early 30's, small business owner with an english degree from Reed College of all places. I spent half my life in Portland, Oregon and my tolerance for twee is high. But this is some silly, half-cooked hipster nonsense to be sure.
B00EQNYOYU|5.0|Their best since their first. PHM is in my opinion one of the greatest albums in music history, this is as close to being its equal as anything else NIN has ever done. Clever composition and complex sounds infused with fantastic lyrics.
0307341550|3.0|Gillian Flynn's first novel, Sharp Objects (2006) is a tale of murder and mystery set in the tiny town of Wind Gap in the boot heel of Missouri. Flynn's talent as a writer is evident from page 1, as is her lack of experience in handling storyline and plot. But it is worth reading this book, if only to appreciate how markedly she had improved by her second novel, Dark Places (2009).<br /><br />The characters in Sharp Objects are the most unlikely and unlikeable bunch of weirdos and wastoids you are likely to meet in the space of 321 pages. Cruelty to children, cruelty to animals, self-abuse, alcohol abuse and drug abuse are just some of the activities that flourish in Wind Gap. It certainly paints an unflattering picture of folk in rural Missouri, and I was wondering what point Flynn was trying to make, when she suddenly came out with this statement on page 223:<br /><br />\\"Missouri is the second-most addicted state in the Union. We get bored down here, and we have a lot of farm chemicals.\\"<br /><br />Flynn could have made much of this powerful and disturbing assertion. Instead it is left unexamined while an increasingly contrived murder mystery scrambles to an unsatisfying conclusion.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a wonderfully uplifting imagining of an actual well intentioned episode in our country's history. The orphan's lives fit together in such a way in the future to help a young teen in foster care. This story encourages belief in Karma, or at least predestination.

B00BEIYP8A|5.0|Rush is very well done about the 1976 F1 season. The first half is so so and not so much about racing, but the second half is awesome with great emotions. The pain Lauda went thru after his accident is all told here.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I have really enjoyed this book. It's a great spin on the existing tales of monsters and the heroes that fight them. It was also nice to have a strong yet vulnerable female lead character. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So addicting love each level  each with more challenging but if you are going to make it free it should be free all the way through and not get to a certain level make it impossible to go any further without buying something pretty ANNOYING

B00EZPCZ5O|5.0|Like some AFI fans, I love their earlier albums.  And like many, I really disliked Crash Love.  Prior to this album release, I would have loved to know that they were going back to their roots.  Have they?  Not quite.  Am I disappointed?  Not at all.<br /><br />This album is a synthesis of the natural progression you would expect after Crash Love AND all of their earlier music combined!  I'm floored that it sounds so great.  Not only does Burials provide tracks that would fit well on any album back to The Art Of Drowning, but the means in which the songs are delivered will clearly remind you 80's artists like The Cure.  It is dark, moody, reminiscent, and is an appropriate response to all critics of their newer sound.  It's as if they intended to deceive one into believing they would go back to their 90's punk rock days, but instead incorporated relics from the decade before it, and beautifully updated it to modern times.  The result is a must-have, quintessential AFI album from a band that continues to do whatever it wants.

B009LDCXNY|5.0|I really love the series and I've kept the collection up to date but...<br />As a few others have commented on; I really enjoyed the theme<br />used when the series started out. The differant plot lines each week<br />were much more crisp and fresh, I still find myself going back to<br />earlier seasons. Not taking anything away from this but if I had<br />my choice, the single week after week episodes of the past were<br />much more enjoyable.
B008JFUOWM|5.0|I like this cover of FAST AND FURIOUS 6 which has VIN DIESEL, DWAYNE JOHNSON, AND PAUL WALKER (GOD BLESS HIS SOUL) standing alongside each other, looks pretty cool. I know this movie is really going to be packed with extreme action and good car chases. Hey, any movie that has both VIN DIESEL AND DWAYNE JOHNSON as a team must be worthwhile and a must see for all the fast and furious fans out there. JUST WATCH THE INTENSITY AND ENJOY THE RIDE.<br /><br />P.S. PAUL WALKER WILL ALWAYS BE PART OF THIS TEAM BECAUSE THERE IS NOBODY LIKE HIM. YOU'LL BE MISSED BUDDY!!!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Lots of music history, great interviews, interesting photos and great soundtrack.  Truly enjoyed myself.  Dave Grohl is awesome. Definite watch.
B00FRN2QZM|5.0|AFI Burials IMHO is one of the best albums to date that they have crafted. Got to love 5. 17 Crimes not to single out any song because every song has its unique feeling and sound.<br />If you like moody Goth rock and punk styles than Burials is the album for you.<br />)0(
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game. Wish you could get more lives than five.  Still very fun and challenging. Highly recommended.  Great for lazy days.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This movie has that good ole jagged edge, fatal attraction....keep you guessing...type of feel that is lacking anymore...I thought it was wonderfully done...
006202406X|5.0|SPOILER ALERT: I find the negative reviews amusing. Why do I get the feeling that if the protagonist lived the reviews would be much different. To me it just confirms Roth's exceptional ability to create connections between reader and character. Perhaps to well since she's receiving death threats. By the way if your reading this and you're one of the aforementioned, maybe you want to rethink the decision to stop taking your meds.<br /><br />This is a fantastic conclusion to a wonderful trilogy. Not bad for the 25 year old.
6305882592|5.0|Classic Classic Cinema! This is Ruth Gordon's Best Film, second to \\"Where's Poppa?\\". And young Bud Cort. What a touching love story about agelessness, freedom, and abandon. Absolutely Good Stuff!
B003GK2216|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I hated to put it down. It had everything an avid reader would like- drama, mystery, intrigue, romance, tragedy, war, politricks, history and geography.............I have fallen in love with this author's novels and I intend to read as many of his books as I can.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I saw this in the theatres when it was first released in IMAX 3-D and have eagerly awaited this DVD release. Exceptionally good Blu-ray quality and I love the Special Features extras...
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Really like this game. Play it daily. No issues. No spending, and is the full version. As you progress pictures and puzzles get harder, but you can always earn hints to help.
B001EAWME2|5.0|I saw this film in theatres when it first came out and it was pretty scary then. What a joy to now own it on DVD. And it's such a joy to see Olivia Hussey (Juliet) and Keir Dullea (David and Dave) together in a truly creepy Holiday Film.
B005CRY2O6|3.0|This rating refers to the Kindle edition only.  Bottom line: Before buying a Kindle book, be sure to browse the *Kindle* version with the &#34;Look Inside&#34; feature.<br /><br />This book has lovely illustrations, unique recipes and readable instructions ... at least,that's what you see if you browse the hardcover version.  I decided to buy the Kindle version and was disappointed to see that<br /><br />- a significant number of recipes are not accompanied by illustrations, although the book description says &#34;a vibrant photo accompanies every recipe&#34;<br />- recipes run together from page to page<br />- the lists of ingredients have no spacing between groups of ingredients or bold-facing for the labels of these groups, which makes for difficult reading and, in some cases, ambiguous instructions<br /><br />I generally don't buy physical books anymore (I do use the library).  However, I like e-books for many reasons (portable, can annotate, can search, built in dictionary, etc.) and I would buy a lot more of them if they seemed worth keeping.  When it looks as if a book was just run through some conversion software with little attention to the reader's visual enjoyment (or, in this case, the usability of the book), the message is &#34;Badly-treated stepsister&#34;.  Let's see Cinderella!<br /><br />I'm happy that Amazon allows us to return Kindle books for a refund.  I'll be buying the hardcover edition of this book.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|Pretty decent Zombie genre offering. I particularly liked the Brad Pitt character. Well written and well acted with decent cast. Some pretty good action sequences, as well....
B00F91SCXC|4.0|In the spirit of most zombie movies, there's a pandemic that is spreading through human bites breaking skin. While the premise is believable, the pace of the action and the fact that the zombies aren't shuffling slow but incredibly fast means the movie just flies by going from action sequence to action sequence. Brad Pitt's character is left without having a lot of his background filled in - we are told that he's essentially a &#34;special forces&#34; type who is brought back into service to escort a virologist to the suspected outbreak source to find Patient Zero - but a shocker of a development leaves him alone to do the investigation himself, flying from military hotspot to hotspot to gather the info. At some point, they abandon the search for Patient Zero in an effort to just find some answer for how to contain the spread of the disease - a very current proposed solution (which was a nice twist) provides a very good sequence of scenes that make the entire movie totally worthwhile - but the ending is one of those which sets up a potential series of movies to continue the storyline further (I don't know if what is left of the story is worthy of continuation, but that's another topic for discussion...). Fun movie, really enjoyed it as a light evening's entertainment.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I really liked it. It was wonderful. And I liked how you had to actually put together the words in order to make the sentence. I recommend you to get this.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|Awesome acting, screenplay special effects, cast, and directing. Also an incredible book by Carl Sagan! A must see in Blue ray!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I like the mana aspect of the game maybe more than magic. the cards are just as awesome as the cards in magic
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Good action, quick to learn and play. Crashes occasionally but seems to happen less often if you restart your kindle every couple of days. Possible to advance in the game without dumping load of cash into it. Fun.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|Most albums have a few good tracks and a bunch of filler that you can't resist hitting the Skip/Next button on. Not the case with Pure Heroine by Lorde. Of course everybody knows 'Royals' but 'Team' and 'White Teeth Teens' are great and probable hit singles. If you're a Pop-Mild sort of music lover, as in somebody who looks forward to the next Dido album, you'll like 'Buzzcut Season' as well. The only tracks that don't have much appeal to me are '08-Still Sane' and '10-A World Alone' but even those two aren't something that you're necessarily gonna dive for the Skip/Next button on.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a wonderful bingo game that you do not need social media acct to play. And good for all ages.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is one of those gAme which kill alot of time I love it....the only thing that stinks is when you run out of energy and have to wait till you regain it....Other then that this game is perfect on my kindle fire 8.9....Way better then the 2013 edition......
3836503050|5.0|This book is one of my favorites because it has a lot of pin ups images, which I love. Gil Elvgren did a great work!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I always play this game on mobile and PC. And when i got my Kindle Fire<br />For Christmas last year i was hoping i could play this game but i couldn't.<br />But now Candy Crush Saga is now on Kindle Fire.<br />Yeah.. I love playing on this game everyday....
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A little strange but a good book. A little short should have a few more pages.might purchase another book in the future
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have only been doing this workout for about a week, so I will post updates if anything changes. Here are my initial impressions:<br /><br />--I started with Level 1, and didn't use weights simply because I couldn't find mine. In hindsight, I'm glad I didn't, as I was really sore the next day, even though I walk regularly and lug my 25-lb toddler around. This workout really seems to work all muscle groups.<br /><br />--The workout is not 20 minutes start-to-finish. It is 20 minutes, not counting the warm-up and cool-down. Not a big deal to me, but those few extra minutes make a difference in how I budget my time to fit it in my schedule.<br /><br />--My biggest gripe is that I have to watch the whole beginning part of the DVD every time I do the workout! I can't fast forward or just skip to the menu, which adds another few minutes, which does add up when I'm trying to squeeze it in during my baby's nap. I just have to start it before I'm actually ready to work out and let it sit on the menu screen until I'm ready.
1439153663|5.0|This was a really great book.  I read it in one day, couldn't put it down - brought tears to my eyes in a couple of places.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun to play. Something to pass time. Has its flaws but its a free app. Its all luck. Always enjoyed bingo. So this game is great to me.
B00CTT9646|4.0|Wonderul movie and a good set.  The Phaser is nice for a Star Trek junkie like my self, but if you just liked the movie, I don't think it is needed.  The movie was very well done and it taking the franchise in a good direction, as long as they actually go into space more in the next movie.  I would recoment this set to big star trek fans, but likley go with just the blue ray if a person just liked the movie.
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Enjoyable.  Lots of different puzzles to choose from keep you wanting to score higher. If you are for a challenge tgen give this one a try.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|My daughter is 3 and this is the first time she has seen the little mermaid. For me, it was a walk down memory lane.  I love the movie, and this set has it all.  The music is great and now on my ipod and computer.  The digital copy is great to have, just make sure you down load it sooner rather than later because it says that the code expires (although I have never had an issue with these codes actually expiring.)  Nice also to have the regular copy to play in the mini van on long trips.  Graphics are older, but have been made a little crisper.  Great set to get this movie in every format, and the music is wonderful.
0307949508|5.0|Stieg Larson's 2nd book in the series in the Millennium Series is more of his excellent writing. The second book flows from The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, yet can be read as a separate book to someone who has not read the first. I love Larson's detailed writing and his characters. Lisbeth Salander is so interesting, aloof and separated at times and thoughtful and feeling at other times. Blomquist, the other main character in the book is a man with solid conviction. Altogether, a very good read.
006202406X|1.0|I found this final book to be repetitive (another uprising? more deception?) followed by a horrible ending. Really, the only point of Tris' death was to provide a shock for the audience. It did not further the plot or provide further character development for Tris...and it left me frustrated and feeling like I wasted my time!
B002PEP4U0|5.0|I first learned of this book when William Kawambwa when he made a guest experience on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.  Like thousands of others I was blown away by his  story and is personality and sense of humor that he still after everything he had to over come.  This story had me laughing and crying and I am so proud of William.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is definitely worth the money no questions. The best thing about is everybody has it. And the light version is basically the same thing this is way better than any other apps like it. Love it &lt;3 :)
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is very addictive. The game is challenging but not to hard not to be able to advance. I really like that you can zoom in on the scenes.  I would highly recommend.
B00B19G01C|5.0|Not predictable at all and very interesting. It kept my attention all the way through. I am so glad I chose it.
006202406X|1.0|I am not one to review books but had to post my opinion on this one. I share all of the negative views posted so far.  It is hard to believe this book was written by the same author as Divergent and Insurgent as it is completely lacking in the emotions that made the first two books so captivating. It does seem like she lost interest in her characters or perhaps this is what you get when you are under a tight deadline from a publisher.  I am shocked the publisher allowed this book to be published in its current form particularly with so much at stake with the movie, etc.  Definitely a poor business decision.  My disappointment wasn't so much the ending as the whole book in general.  Boring, repetitive, yet another rebellion...couldn't they think of something more original for the third book? Also, Four went from this bad ass to this sniveling, insecure, shell of what we all came to expect.  The POV's were both the same and I never knew who was narrating which made it pointless. There were so many inconsistencies as well...too many to list but most covered in some of the other reviews.  Don't waste your money, take it out of the library or come up with your own ending.  Anything is better than this sad excuse for an end to what was a pretty amazing series.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This us a great game. My daughter loves to play this game. And the Halloween theme is good to. I would recommend this
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really loved<br /><br /> the ending such as finding out  all of the tributes (Victors  from the previous games) planned to escape by disabling the force field and the remaining tribute  saved by district 13
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an exciting, addicting game but not easy to win.  That made it an awesome challenge while being fun to play.
B001IWUZYK|3.0|We were planning on watching the 2005 remake of Oliver Twist when we came across this film. A bit of a tragic story line for a musical. I will say however that the acting by the Fagan character and the Artful Dodger were superb. These performances saved the day
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I do not want to spoil the story so I will tell you that this book was excellent. The characters grew and you felt their struggles and their triumphs. I was sad to have the story come to an end and I will miss Four and Tris. A must read. The entire series is worth it!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I wish I had bought this movie.  I saw it in the theaters last year and loved it.  It is beautiful and the music is amazing.  I highly recommend watching this movie!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Loved this game for months and am happy Amazon.com finally put it in their store for the Kindle Fire HD!<br />Very addicting and fun game that you can play with your Facebook friends. Downloaded it and it connected to the game I already had in progress!<br />Thank you Amazon!
B00BFV1JVM|5.0|the hunger games is an amazing  book filled with adventure courage friendship loyalty love lies sadness andbhappiness you truly feel moved i just could not put it down
B008FRFN7A|3.0|If you do not have your documents in the File, Photos, or Web that is on the app, you cannot find them to print. At least that is my problem. It does work great if you can find the file you need and print it.<br />I need to be able to take a file from &#34;My Downloads&#34; and print it using this app. There may be a way to do this but I have not figured it out. It is not completely useless to me, but could be better.<br />If anyone can figure or has figured this out, please feel free to share!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I'm digging the charger a lot. Unlike other charges I've tried, this is pretty small and only sticks out about an inch from the port. It doesn't charge my S4 as fast as a wall plug, but I suspect that has more to do with the limitations of a car electrical outlet than the product itself. The plastic feels substantial and durable, not that I'll be removing it from the port very often. Good product, especially considering the prices of charges in brick and mortar stores.
B007PKDW44|4.0|After listening to the whole disc, I found all of it good for jamming. Many albums have only a few good jams but this one had me rocking all night long...
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I just can not stop playing.... until I run out if lives of course. I really do love this game.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|My step grandson is really into these Japanese films.  It made a perfect birthday gift for him.  He was thrilled.
B00G32OER4|4.0|If you like based on true events, then you will like this witchcraft movie.  I enjoy true movies or documentaries, and this movie is based on true events, which makes this movie much more scarier.
B0060D3BWK|5.0|I love the witches and bette midler cracks me up in this movie a true classic. Would recommend to any family.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Interface makes it easy to play on my I Kindle. The longer you play bingo blitz however between the max number of credits you earn each day (without) paying for more makes it hard to complete seasonal rooms. But I still play it every day.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Arrived before time - Awesome<br /><br />My below observation is using my laptop with internet speed of 12mbps<br />Youtube - streaming well with quality<br />Neflix - streaming well with quality<br />When cast  tab or desktop(beta) with running video in browser the first frame/picture cast and then hangs without any video or audio. I am sure they will improve this in future.<br /><br />I am returning this and may buy again when cast tab & desktop without any issue.<br />If you are looking for cast only youtube and netflix this is really very nice device.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|This book was really enthralling. I had a hard time putting it down. Love the history in it, it taught me a lot
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|A feel-good story that reminds us of the importance of kindness. This was a quick read, and worth the time. My only complaint would be that it might be unrealistically positive, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|Love this movie; no matter how 'childish' it may appear, it is also 'smart fun' for the adult who needs a break from the heady stuff of daily life.  Glad we added it to our collection!
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|I got this app as  part of Amazon's free app of the day, but I think paying for this app would be well worth it. The game has pretty simple mechanics, simple enough that a preschooler could probably understand. Yet, the way the game uses those mechanics can be very fun and challenging for all ages.<br /><br />In the game, you control a firetruck. Your mission is to get to the end of the level without any huts burning down. Controls are simple: swipe up and down on the screen to change the height of your firehose, press the big red button to spray water. The path to the end of the road is blocked with all sorts of puzzles and burning things. Puzzles are solved by figuring out exactly where, when, and how to spray the water. In addition, your tank can only hold so much water before it runs out. Sometimes you just need to figure out the most efficient way to use the water, other times you have to figure out how to move sliding bricks out of way by using elaborate tunnels and banking the water.<br /><br />This game is lots of fun, I would definitely recommend it. I could see it being lots of fun for a whole family, or even if you are just bored while waiting in line for a coffee.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive game. Good Fun. All my family  and friends play it too. Great that it is now on Kindle Fire.
B000I9WWCM|4.0|I rewatch this movie because I find it a touching and fun romantic movie.  The variety of characters add depth to it.  The setting gives it a unique touch.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was just a kid when The Shining came out and it was scary. But kid scary, like bad dreams \\"monsters are going to get me.\\" Haha. But this was entertaining and nerve wracking. I know monsters are real now! This book just lets me know that other people do too. I really hope Abra grows up to be a wonderful person with her power or King just might have to put a third novel to this story. Hmmm. I was not sure what to expect but I do know that once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. Page after page I just had to find out what happens. It was gripping. I loved the ending. Such irony. Didn't see that coming. Just in case you haven't read it I won't give it away but you'll see what I mean when you do. I would put thus in my top ten of King's books that I've read, and I've read most of them. He blew me away with this one though. Just when you think you got it figured out it turns on you. This will become a classic like the Shining. Great job King. Top hats of to you!
B000I9X7R6|5.0|I found The Edge a riviting, colorful, and delightfully frighting movie.  I would recommend it to brave viewers. The scenery is in a class by itself.
1250038820|5.0|I found out about HONY on tumblr a while back and was excited to see that there was a book being made.  It's amazing how each photo tells a story and is enhanced by the quotes.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|Hannibal is a wonderfully delicious watch!  Before this show I thought no one could play Hannibal Lecter however, now I think Mads is bone chillingly hands down the best Hannibal ever!  And Hugh as Will Graham is top notch!  Cannot wait for Season 2!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Great Product! Access files from almost anywhere! Extremely convenient. Everything you need can always be close at hand. Dropbox it on all your devices.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Challenging but fun. Addictive! Spend hours with different puzzles. Every level is different. share lives with friends. connect with facebook.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I can always print directly at home from wherever I happen to be! Great convenience. Works just like you would always wish all printers did.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I just love this Mahjong game. It's easy and challenging as you continue to play . I play it on my kindle all the time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Have it on my Ipad and my phone so I can share books no matter where I am or what device I have with me at the time.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is one of must fun games I ever played. Thanks for creating this game your a hero! Remember if you what this game your going to have challenges
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I'm not happy with the way things ended. There had to have been another way. Thanks for the heartbreak Veronica Roth.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a game for the whole family. I love that it is updated for the seasons.  It is challenging and entertaining!!!
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Super fast delivery, great new condition. As a kid I used to watch re-runs of this show (because I'm not that old) but I never watch the &#34;pilot&#34; episode, neither I remember any of the episodes. I recently watch the fist DVD and it was AWESOME!! I enjoyed it very much. Super cheap for a CLASIC with 6 DVD's.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I think this game is awesome. I was addicting..... and I've already passed the whole entire game. Including the extra levels. I recommend this app to children who want some entertainment!!!
B000B7HZXM|4.0|Shipped very quickly.  I love this CD.  I have always loved Rod Stewart and this is a wonderful CD.  Would recommend.
0345529057|5.0|Delivered quickly and is in perfect condition. The box set is brand new and is still in plastic wrap. Great deal for four books!
B009NXV51S|5.0|2013-10-25
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My wife has had this game for some time. I couldn't wait to have it myself. It is very fun to play and quickly challenges you while passing time.
B00AEFXKOO|5.0|Even though the first 10 minutes of the movie have not been restored, everything else is absolutely great. The video and audio quality is excellent and the second disc is full of interesting extras most of them in full HD.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I had seen the PBS/Great Performances program in which Paul McCartney sang the same songs as this album, so I am pleased to be able to listening to them again & again.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thought this was a great way to continue the shining it brings docs story to a brilliant conclusion .I hope Stephen king revisits other novel of his to see if there story's can also continue
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Kind of disappointing they killed off all the good actors at the beginning from the original GI Joe.  But still a good movie.
B0035HKWLW|4.0|The movie called &#34;MASK&#34; is a pretty funny movie.  It is amazing what kind of things the man in green can do.  You will enjoy this movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad I can finally play candy crrush on my kindle!! But then again, maybe it's  just one more reason to keep me distracted :)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I recommend this game to everybody! It's fun, addictive, and just awesome! Only thing that sucks is the wait for new lives...
B001BKTEZA|4.0|So I did that quintessential teenage thing of staying up far past my bedtime because the book I was reading was so. good. Finished Grapes of Wrath at about 1:30am last night. What a gorgeous book. Great, now I get to be emotionally bereft all weekend.
B005PK56TA|5.0|loved it, scary, crazy and .<br />Addicted to American Horror Story.<br />Got my boyfriend hooked on the show as well.
B00FX8EY60|5.0|So awesome! Beats are great, words are positive and the songs actually have meaning. She definitely went in her own direction on this album and it worked out great.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I can recommend this book to those who are interested in how we make decisions. It provides reasons for how we reach decisions through what seems like an instinctive, near instantaneous reaction to an event. Kahneman's book contrasts those snap judgements with decisions that require analysis and deeper thought. That contrast offers a basis on which to evaluate decisions that later prove to be correct or not. More important, we are offered a way to distinguish between two different processes for decision making.<br /><br />For me, how the mind functions within the brain is a fascinating, but as yet poorly understood aspect of human nature. Kahneman guides us through an approach to understanding at least part of that process, and presents information in a very personal form that I find easy and entertaining to read.<br /><br />Kahneman does get a little repetitive in places, although not enough to be really distracting. The subject is complex enough that viewing the ideas from multiple perspectives is valuable. For those among us who are constantly wondering how we get from place to place across the mind map, this is great stuff.<br /><br />Recommended.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I read this in a High School English class and probably another 3 times since then.  Wonderfully written by the Oscar Wilde, do authors like this exist anymore?
B005HV6Y84|1.0|I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ITEM, BECAUSE IT CAME DAMAGED.  THE CD CARTON IS ALL CRACKED, AND THE CD IS RUINED AND DOESN'T PLAY RIGHT AT ALL.  SO AS FOR PURCHASING CDS FROM YOU AGAIN WILL NEVER BE.  I LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS CD, AND NOW IT WON'T PLAY PROPERLY.  SO SORRY I AM ANGRY WITH YOU.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great<br />I love this app it is the best u get to play the levels over and I love the unlock quests it's a great idea for when your friends won't send you anything I totally looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove it
B008M721MS|5.0|It is cool it is easy to use I can finally talk to my friends sence like 3 months sence so I like it and sometimes people on my Skype support me when I am sad or mad and make me happy.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is a fantastic product. I got one and then I got another. And if I get the opportunity I will buy a third. Simple and easy to use.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it it always help me when I am doing my homework in math I love the way it gives time alot of less time to do the problem.peace!!!lol just kidding
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I teared up a little re-watching this. Last time I saw it was when I was a kid so all the adult-type things went right over my head. Watching it now, wow, that poor girl. The ending was perfect, though, despite all the sad and angry bits.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|The twists and turns in this season leave you sitting on the edge of your seat.  A couple of the previous seasons had gotten almost predictable.  Predictable is definitely not a word for this season.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|The show was written well and the actors do a good job. I find myself looking for this show over other similar shows presently on like Castle or Bones.
B00003CXE7|5.0|My favorite movie of all times. The quality is decent (it stops few times at the beginning of the movie but it doesn't bother me that much). Thx
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|I love Monsters Inc. and all the Disney-Pixar movies, and I was so excited for this prequel since it was announced! And \\"Monsters University\\" didn't dissapointed at all! Like always, the animation is superb, the story is more meaningful than other current kid movies (like Despicable Me) and it values friendship, accepting who you are, believing in yourself and having self-confidence. With this film, we see Mike and Sulley on their college days, and we get to see that they didn't get along at the first time, the way they mock college sororities, and the little details they used from Monsters Inc. were just magical. You get entertained since the very first minute until it ends! I can see myself watching it a million times and never get bored of it, because it's so good you'll never get tired of it.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Monsters University\\" easily becomes the best movie of the summer, and I hope Disney-Pixar keeps bringing such unique movies like this one, and hopefully Monsters Inc. 2 too!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I loved this movie because it was scary and suspensful without using unecessary gore to elicit cheap thrills.  The filmmakers use phenomenal acting and creative camera work to create shocking and suspensful situations without being over the top with blood, guts, and violence.  Don't get me wrong, this film is not particularly tame and is definitely still a zombie movie.  It is very well done.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|I would like to be able to just quit without starting a new game and I have not found a way to do that. Otherwise it is pretty much like any other Free Cell game I have played.
B000FC13MM|3.0|I loved the world Nix has created. I also enjoyed the necromancy system. The story is interesting and ejoyable. Sabriel is a fast paced book that never gets boring.<br /><br />However, it lacks a lot of the depth I look for in fantasy books. If you, like me, like Steven Erikson, Brandon Sanderson, and Matthew Stover, you are in for a disappointment. Character backgrounds are severely lacking and many of the decisions they make just don't make a lot of sense.<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed the book for its unique concepts and fast paced story, but will not read the rest of the series.
006202406X|1.0|Can't believe I waited for months to waste my time on this horrible disappointment of a book. Save your money. Save your time. And don't bother reading this!!! Won't be reading any more of this authors work.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|The worst science fiction film ever.  No plot, no real action, no resolve, no quality acting. In short a big zero.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved our being on the interior of the character's heart and mind, feeling into the other person's thinking and emotions, even if they didn't let on out loud or show them always.  And it seemed so plausible and credible.  The first few chapters were a little slow, but the pace because much more interesting and very worth while.  I loved that the few families and the various members became intertwined.  A great read.
B00FRN2QZM|5.0|This album was well worth the wait.  A perfect blend of songs that are light, dark, haunting and even angry at times.  It's nice to hear Davey scream again :p
006202406X|3.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />I think first and for most we all should have seen the ending coming (I mean come on she killed like almost every other character we have met). I know that we wanted the happy ever after with Tris and Tobias having little baby Four's running around, but I never saw that happening. I knew that one of them would pay the ultimate sacrifice and absolutely agree it would be Tris. It is exactly what her character would do, sacrificing her life for the people she loves.<br /><br />I heard people say 'that it's not fair Tris didn't get to see the world after she helped save it and make it better' and their right it's not fair, but I think that's the point.<br />There are plently of people who have died before they got to see how they changed things for the better and this is one of those cases, but without her it would have never happened. Caleb would not have been able to complete the mission, only Tris could have, because she is brave and selfless, were Caleb is a coward.<br /><br />It's never fun to see character die that you've grown to love (HELLO Harry Potter, Mockingjay) I'm still not over Fred.<br /><br />I didn't have a problem with the end of the book. I thought it was fitting for the characters (even though I cried for Tobias when he found out) and wrapped up this world nicely.<br />My problem with it and why I only gave it three stars, was the middle of the books. As many others have said it didn't feel well thought out or as polished as the first two. I think this story of the GD's and GP's could have been a series in and of itself. I felt like we just abandoned Chicago and I felt distanced from the other character we had grown to care about, even the ones at the Bureau. I was confused at some points as to what was even being explained because it felt rushed. There wasn't enough time to explain this whole new part of the world and that made the story suffer.<br /><br />I didn't mind the switching POV's in concept (even though I normally hate when that happens halfway through a series IE: the Matched series) because we had already had a few novellas from Tobias's POV, but I can tell Veronica didn't really have the internal voice of Four down because a lot of the time I couldn't tell which person it was Tris or Tobias.<br /><br />Someone of the character choice didn't seem natural and that they were just there to further the plot but overall I think it was a fitting end to the series. It is my least favorite in the trilogy, but not because of the end.PG 416 might bump it up one more star.<br /><br />Remember not all books are for wish fulfillment. The author doesn't owe you the happy ever after if that isn't how the story is supposed to go. The author gives you the story you need, the one that is true to the characters and the world they are in. It's their story and if you truly love these characters and their story, then you go with them wherever that may be good or bad. Every new book teaches us something different, gives a glimpse into another way of thinking and helps us expand in our way of thinking and hopefully makes us a little better for it in the end. But you don't have to like the ending or the book even. Everyone is entitled to their option and its welcomed. Discussion is one of the greatest things about reading books.<br /><br />And to all those people who are devastated by the ending of this adventure for whatever reason (I feel you guys)remember this quote from the book Inkheart: \\"Stories never really end...even if the books like to pretend they do. Stories always go on. They don't end on the last page, anymore than they begin on the first.\\"
B007VTUYWW|5.0|This is, arguably, one of the best adaptations from game to big screen.  Angelina Jolie fills the Lara Croft mold perfectly.  Great action scenes and IMO, the best movie of the series.
B00G32OER4|5.0|This movie will make you jump and scream!  I highly recommend it.  Just when you think it's safe, watch out!
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|I really didn't think I was going to like this movie, but what a surprise! In the theater everyone was laughing out loud including me. There were times I could hardly breath I was laughing so hard. This movie has its low points, but overall it is a scream! I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ITS TECH TIME. it is so fun. its like block it up time.<br />there all ways a update. buy these app.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|The idea is very good and the games are fun. But the menus and overall appearance should be improved.The background image is inappropriate
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now I can recommend Kindle.  Was disappointed when I first bought Kindle and candy crush was not available. Addictive game.  More so when you compete with friends.
B00DJ3ITKS|4.0|A wonderful read. This book holds many valuable insights into not just Amazon as a retailer and as one of the 4 horsemen in technology today, but also leadership, tenacity, negotiation and just thinking big and thinking long term.<br /><br />Would have liked it better if it had more details on lab 126 and insights into development of AWS and kindle Fire
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Its great that I can now play a game on my kindle and my computer can we please have morre
B00BQ1DATU|4.0|There is nothing wrong with this music but only bought it for one of the songs.  The rest of the music is fine but not exactly my taste.  Those more familiar with this type of music would probably be pleased.
B006BFK5DK|4.0|Now, Then & Forever  - My Promise is to Sign On and follow the Guiding Lights because The Rush is on and Love Is Law. Got To Be Love, who else could make me have the Night Of My Life on the Dance Floor through listening and dancing, who else but Earth, Wind & Fire? Okay the paragraph was put together using song titles from the CD. Silly? Well truth be told, this CD can take you back to a time when things were great and one could sit and do silly enjoyable stuff while listening to good music. There is also something to be said for the &#34;familiar&#34; which in this case comes from the piano sounds of Larry Dunnn, which brought Ralph, Verdine and Philip closer to the sound founder Maurice White was instrumental in developing.
B00005RHGL|5.0|This movie should be required viewing!  With this DVD and the extras such as how they tried to stay authenticate to the time period, I would recommend highly!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great time killer for when you don't have internet. No hints so it forces you to be creative and patient. Can't wait for more levels.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|The way the music flows together and is interwoven is excellent!  The Beatles are always the Best and this is a good complilation of earlier and later songs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was playing this game on my phone and immediately got addicted. I am so glad that I can now play it on my Kindle.
0061950726|5.0|This is a very poignant story based on the actual treatment of orphans during the early 20th century.  Kline immediately engages the reader with a dual narrative technique.  She superbly develops the two main characters presented from different perspectives until their paths interwine. Excellent.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this awesome movie.  Heath Ledger's role as the Joker is memorable for sure and if you like action and good vs. evil type movies then this is the movie for you.  You can't go wrong with Blu-ray, just makes it that much more of an enjoyable, edge of your seat movie watching.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|I did like this movie.  Michael Douglas was amazing and equally as well was Matt Damon.  It was very entertaining.
B00CLH1PHM|4.0|This short story includes a straightforward plot with fully realized characters.  I look forward to reading more stories by Mr. Whitehead.
B00AL1P9PY|5.0|I haven't listened to this album since the early eighties on a cassette. The remastered version brings out those notes so crystal clear that my cassette, well worn mind you, could ever achieve. Geddy Lee's unique vocals are accentuated by Alex's precision guitar and as always Neil is spot on. I have always loved Rush's lyrics and this was a great flashback. Thanks Amazon for letting me relive some of those memories from the 70's and great years in high school..
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|For  a free app is great.  It to many annoying ads, it does what it says.  It'd be nice to have more tone choices, but you get what you pay for.  All and all, a good app. Recco
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very useful purchase, I'm from Uruguay (SouthAmerica) and the device works perfectly fine! I was afraid Google Chromecast does not accept my location, but everything worked really good!<br /><br />The main feature of this device is that you can broadcast Youtube videos and Netflix Films from your PC, Tablet and Smartphone to your HD TV, by plugging it to its HDMI port. Also you can cast a webpage that you are in your PC (not sure if it is possible to do the same with your cellphone).<br /><br />Only one thing, not groovy at all, sometimes there is a delay or freeze between the video you are casting and the TV, and some Youtube playlist does not play all the songs...
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|This is a great product, it was a quick delivery,  and I would definitely recommend purchasing.<br />I choose five stars for the clarity.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy this is finally on the kindle....now I have more devices to play it on. Can't wait to waste many hours lol.
B00B7I8HZ4|4.0|Review of Intel NUC Model DCCP847DYE<br /><br />I thought I would post a review of this unit that might help someone else in their selection.  My intended use for this device was to attempt to use it as either a Ubuntu linux based XBMC box or as a Windows 7 Media Center if it has the juice to make it.  I read numerous reviews, most were positive with respect to the box making it as a media center but there were a few that said \\"no way\\".  So I had a fair bit of angst regarding my decision and none of the reviewers that I recall provided any specific information about what they were asking the box to do beyond a general XBMC or HTPC function.<br /><br />So let me start by providing details about my infrastructure and the configuration of this unit.  I purchased a single 4 GB DDR3 1333 memory module (it was a Crucial brand, about $43 here on Amazon), I also have a 64 GB ADATA SX300 SSD (about $75 at Newegg).  I didn't bother with any WiFi/Bluetooth module.  In my experience WiFi just isn't a substitute for a wired network when it comes to video and if your serious about trying to get \\"good\\" performance from this box then a wired network is really the only way to go, everything in my house that can be wired is (of course laptops and smartphones are wireless), and all of it is gigabit ethernet, although 100 megabit should be fine.  The unit also has a \\"flirc\\" (see [...] serving as the IR receiver, it is a bit pricey, about $23, but it is fully programmable and allows you to utilize an existing remote.  If there is one thing that bugs me it is having multiple remotes needed to do anything, so with this really neat device I am able to use the regular TV remote (it is a multi-function remote) and so we now have 1 remote for the Apple TV and 1 remote that covers the TV and the HTPC.  I also had a Logitech bluetooth keyboard (a di Novo mini) around the house that I use ONLY when I must have a keyboard/mouse such as system maintenance.  Aside from that the unit runs without keyboard/mouse using only the TV remote.<br /><br />The video source is a Silicon Dust HDHomeRun Prime (with a cable card, about $140 on Amazon), this allows the addition of a cable company provided m-card which supports 3 tuners.  Our cable company, Comcast, now scrambles everything even local programming.  A plus with this is it can support reception and recording of premium content (HBO, Starz, etc...) as well.  By \\"can\\" support I mean that the HDHomeRun supports it when the receiver is DTCP-IP (copy protection) capable.  So in the case of Windows media center playback and recording of premium content is supported.  One of the reasons for this unit is we have a number of TV's in the house and the HDHomeRun supports UPnP/DLNA so I can have some device at each TV which can go to the networked tuner and display channels on that TV.  Somewhat off topic but I also hate having a cable company provided device attached to each TV, even the little boxes that are digital converters (Comcast charges $2 a month for each box) only support SD and you cannot get HD without using the more expensive boxes ($10 a month).  Ok, lets get back on topic.  That is a quick summary of the \\"video\\" and it is networked to the tuners so I could place the gear anywhere I can connect to the network using a wired connection.  Lastly I'm using a 1.5 TB USB 2.0 disk for recording of content, I had it around the house and ended up taking apart an old Maxtor One Touch external USB 2.0 disk and replacing the old 500 GB disk with the 1.5 TB one.<br /><br />So if I went with a linux/XBMC setup the plan was for this unit to be able to play TV content obtained from the networked tuner on the \\"local\\" TV, a must have with this configuration would be support for a TV Guide function as well where I can start a stream directly from the guide.  This was the fall back plan as paying about $300 to have the ability to play TV rather than use a cable company box is too pricey for me when considering the number of TV's.  The \\"hoped\\" for solution was a Windows media server that supports recording and playback of TV content from the networked tuner.  So I started out \\"going for the gold\\" and installed an old copy of Windows 7 Professional I had around that I really never used (we are a MAC/OS X household for the past 5 or so years).  The various drivers needed for the unit were available from the Intel NUC support area.  The only painful part was I had an upgrade edition of Windows 7 and ended up having to install Windows XP to make the Windows 7 install happy.  That is a whole other issue, suffice it to say got Windows 7 installed.  As I said this was an original copy purchased in July 2011.  Needless to say it required some updates to be installed, over 200 and this \\"low end\\" processor took about 7 hours to finish all the updates.  It took so long I was very concerned if I could even run Windows 7 on this box.  But after having \\"paid my dues\\" and completed the updates I was pleasantly surprised from there on out.  The box runs Windows 7 just fine (at least in my configuration).  The only things I have installed are antivirus (Microsoft Security Essentials), the HDHomeRun Prime software, Windows 7 and Remote Potato.  So running using the performance tab on the task manager I made a number of informal CPU utilization measurements.  Playback of HD content results in a data stream that is about 15-19 Mbps for each stream, this is just not an issue for my gigabit network, not an issue for a 100 Mbps network either, even with 3 streams (2 record and 1 live) the box was using about 6% of the network bandwidth according to the task manager display. Viewing of Live TV HD content resulted in a CPU utilization that hovered around 5%.  A recording of HD content resulted in about 20-25% utilization and this appeared to scale pretty well with about 45-55% utilization when recording 2 HD streams.  Finally putting them all together with display of 1 live HD program and 2 HD recording simultaneously the CPU hovered at about 60-70% utilization, there were spikes to 100% when starting or stopping a recording but in general the average was lets say 70% for recording 2 HD streams and watching HD live tv.  Bottom line the box looks pretty darn good in this area.  Playback of a recorded program was also in the 5% neighborhood which is great, while I didn't try it that would indicate that I could record 3 HD programs while playing back a previously recorded program.  I don't have any measurements on the USB/disk utilization but USB 2 is \\"supposed\\" to support about 480 mbps so even at 20 mbps per stream I should not be over taxing the USB interface, so I would assume that 3 recording and 1 playback all simultaneously should be no problem.<br /><br />The \\"fly in the ointment\\" is remote playback.  As I mentioned earlier I have installed a copy of Remote Potato a very nice piece of software that supports a browser interface to setup and manage recordings as well as providing remote playback.  The setup and maintenance of recordings is no problem at all, works just fine.  However the playback is a killer and to be fair I would have to call it unusable.  The box runs at about 80-100% utilization, mostly in the 90+ area and video will play for a period then stop completely for maybe 20 seconds then resume again.  Even the CPU loading on the playback machine (for this test I used a 2009 mac mini with a Core 2 Duo processor at 2 GHz) is very high running about 70-80%.  Not sure exactly what is going on but playback to a remote machine in this configuration is just not workable, I suspect that it is the work involved with transcoding the content.  When I was \\"playing\\" around with this I had the same software setup running on a virtual machine on a hackintosh with a core i7 processor and had no issue at all. I believe that it most likely is the Remote Potato server causing this since live TV and recorded playback on Windows media server is not CPU intensive. So if remote playback (using Remote Potato, probably any application) is important to you this is NOT the machine to buy.  Let me say I have NOT done any investigation into what is going on, I think it is most likely Remote Potato causing the issue requesting the server in the Windows 7 machine do some heavy transcoding, I just don't know, but as mentioned earlier in this review playback on this box itself within Windows media center is NOT CPU intensive.  I do know that whatever video resolution I selected in Remote Potato it had the same problem, from the lowest to the highest video resolution playback in a browser just doesn't make it, at least when using Remote Potato.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful to someone.

006202406X|2.0|I was late to the Divergent series and read the first two books in the last couple weeks. I really liked both, and couldn't wait to read Allegiant.  I found this story entertaining for the most part (I agree with other reviewers that the Evelyn part was hard to believe and the dual point of views were too similar), but the ending made me feel completely depressed! I have two young children and I rarely have time to read, so it really ruined the series for me because I know I won't go back and reread them after feeling like that.  I guess that means she did a good job making me feel connected to the characters, but to kill of Tris and then leave Tobias pretty much alone without much hope is too much for me. I'm wishing I didn't read this last one at all.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so excited that this game is now available for Kindle!!!  The game is the same one as the original. No more looking for a tolerable substitute.<br />The only problem I have had, is I haven't been able to connect to Facebook.
006202406X|1.0|*****SPOILERS****<br /><br />I was waiting for this book for what I feel was SO long! and now that I have read it, it was SO DISAPPOINTING!!<br />I didn't mind the fact that was written in four/tris perspectives, in fact I think it was kind of cool, BUT they seemed like two totally different characters!!! They changed personalities and moods so fast, and the plot was not helping. It was a complete different scenario... They basically forget about their people, their home... And everything is chaotic... several new characters arise.. and everybody is dying like there is no tomorrow...<br />WHo is still living from the first book?? it seems everybody dies and without any purpose.. Four ends living with his mom??? WHAT??? TRIS DIES??????? and without importance it seems... I kept reading thinking that she was going to \\"live\\" somehow...<br />The whole book was so far from what expected.. besides the horrible ending, the plot was to far fetched and detached from the first two books.. like a complete new plot.<br />Disappointed, do not recommended.

B00F0AAC26|4.0|Amongst the samples, I find four very agreeable numbers, TRIPWIRE, IF I COULD BELIEVE, WAKE ME UP, VICEROY'S ROW...in his late '50s he's able to issue sounds which this Reviewer would believe are outtakes from Imperial Bedroom. I like his smoky, monophonic voice upfront and that's what we get on those four songs.<br /><br />On songs sounding consciously contemporary, his voice is pushed back into video game electronics, though they are tastefully relegated to a small corner of the left speaker.<br /><br />Can't say this is a \\"comeback\\" album from an oldie (looks like EC has had fairly steady releases in the past decade) so my desire to say it's much better than the most recent stuff by McCartney, Neil Diamond, Graham Parker, Elton John, Cher, must be squelched.<br /><br />One Reviewer complained about Costello sampling himself here...I find it still a creative collaboration. Even if Elvis temporarily \\"ran dry\\" and said, let's reminisce...he's one composer who has earned that right. Name one R & R composer since Dylan wrote himself out around 1975, to compare.

B00C0W08XK|5.0|Offers difficulty levels, pencil notes, and solvable puzzles. I found the format attractive and easy to use. Great for everyone from beginners to pros.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|when I initially heard of this film and primarily its association with Ed and Lorraine Warren, I had a lot of major expectations. Since I had seen them appear as guests on the Don Lane show in the late 70s, on Australian TV, they made a very strong impression; they spoke of their work more in the sense of a vocation and it was very evident that their strong and positive characters/personalities came through right to the forefront. On the show I saw them on, they played some audio tapes which may have come from the UK or may have been from the US, I don't recall, anyway these tapes were spooky, chilling, and if they ever sold them or provided them as an extra on a new version of this film of some of the documentaries about them, I would buy them at the drop of a hat. The essential point I'm trying to convey is that the character of Ed and Lorraine Go to the heart of the story in the conjuring, and I think you cannot divorce Ed and Lorraine as central and credible real-life characters without changing the story.<br /> Right from the start of the film the quality of tension underlies the entire film. James Wan makes the light and shade, as well as a couple of jokes, work immensely well for this film. Although I understand that this was scripted, it was supposed to be scripted from real-life, but thanks to the fact that there is no commentary of any kind, we simply don't know. I think it would be appropriate for the filmmakers to either get Lorraine Warren (if she wants to) do a commentary, or maybe have the writers do a joint commentary saying what is adapted real-life, and what is out and out fiction. Overall, at least from my point of view, I would classify this film as the scariest I've ever seen. I have been shut down about this, and told that MAMA, INSIDIOUS CHAPTER 2, and some other films are scarier, but given what I know about Ed and Lorraine, and that I like supernatural, ghost house type stories (however, this is so much more than just a ghost house story), Istill maintain that this is a James Wan masterpiece that takes you on a tour of the dark side.<br /> When I received the DVD Blu-ray combo was happy to find that the cover was the hologram of one particular scene, and it's pretty cool. I still don't like the ultraviolet option since you have to sign up for two accounts (and they ask you for too much personal material), the file you can stream is only available for a limited time, and the so-called digital download presupposes you've passed over all the personal information before you can get the digital file. Anyway, I really wish the Studios would just can it with the UV garbage and provide a digital download. The Three extras are really great, since you get an interview with the original family, as well as the clearly terrified mother; there is also a special on Lorraine Warren, who takes her work very seriously, and the special feature is a very powerful bonus. The feature with James Wan, is a pleasure to watch, since he is obviously done his research on Ed and Lorraine, and it is clear James enjoys his work, and he knows what scares you...; Which makes his later claim, which he gave in a separate interview that I saw on the BBC, that he is leaving horror all the more devastating: there is simply no one of the caliber of James Wan that I am aware of. I for one, certainly hope he goes back on his statement that he is leaving horror, since I'll be lining up for tickets at the theater, and preorders for combo packs.<br /><br />***<br />Amazon's Fulfillment services in Lexington KY is getting to be very bothersome; I had two orders thrown together in one BAG, and it looked like no care was taken with the orders at all.TAKEN 2 had the cover damaged, and the CD \\"NEW\\" had an obvious bend in the cover; only the CONJURING combo miraculously survived anything except a few minor dings; most of my orders in the last few months have been packed in the same careless manner, and some damage has been above and beyond normal shipping issues, since the el-cheapo packing is used a de-facto send method.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I love these books. I don't even have a word to describe how extraordinary they were. I would have liked a happy ending ( who wouldn't ) but honestly I don't care. I was just bawling. It was a sad, beautiful ending, which usually I don't like, but here it was appropriate.  (if that makes sense) Well done. Can't wait for the movie!!!!!!!
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Fairly consistently, Paul McCartney has been one of those artists that produces amazing work as well as diverse work. Listening to the 14 tracks on the \\"deluxe\\" version of NEW, we basically get a mini tour through his versatility; it really is phenomenal how one man can encompass such an entourage of talents. I must admit I don't have everything he has done, but not for lack of trying (I only have so much money). Not much point in commenting on the individual tracks (except for one) since Paul has talked about how he mostly writes stories and in the sense of a true lyricist, he has talked about how he creates in various interviews. Suffice to say this is a must-have album if you have any like for Paul's work, or find any appeal and his amazing music. The so-called hidden track is on track 15 on the CD and was not part of the Amazon rip. The surprising thing for me was that I received two discs in the package, and so far I cannot discern if the second disc contains variants on the first disc or not. The hidden track is apparently autobiographical and when you get to hear it, truly a beautiful, from the heart song: the object of Paul's affection must be one wonderful lady. Also, if you get the Amazon<br />rip, you get the digital booklet; which is made up of 26 pages of text and photos, quite a surprise bonus.<br /> When I received my damaged copy of NEW, I was kind of surprised but since the damage was minor, and seems to be the result of policy changes I will let it go, and just<br />give the following caveat from my buying in the last few months Amazon's Fulfillment services in Lexington KY is getting to be very bothersome; I had two orders thrown together in one BAG, and it looked like no care was taken with the orders at all.TAKEN 2 had the cover damaged, and the CD \\"NEW\\" had an obvious bend in the cover; only the CONJURING combo miraculously survived anything except a few minor dings; most of my orders in the last few months have been packed in the same carelessmanner, and some damage has been above and beyond normal shipping issues, since the el-<br />cheapo packing is used a de-facto send method.<br />  I really get the impression that the Lexington KY fulfillment services section presents the Bag and Tag, don't care a bit attitude of one part of Amazon, since I have received the same poor excuse for packaging from several Amazon offices over the past few months. And these same places used to have such great packaging for CDs, DVDs and Combo packs; I feel like asking, what did I do to tick you off?? Even the higher price items can't survive the ultra poor packing of a BAG in a smartpost travel.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The author asks us to be brave in her acknowledgement at the end of the book. She was as well in the manner she decided to conclude this portion of the series. I always feel there is more to explore of this world Roth has created. If she does, I look forward to it, if she decides this is it, I am fine.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|Update 10/26 -- Well, after sleeping on this one for a day I think I'm going to drop my rating to three stars. I still feel the same way about the ending, although with time, instead of feeling more at peace with it I think that I am more disappointed in it. I really do think that Veronica Roth could have gone in a different direction that could have been just as gritty and harsh, but a direction that could have at least rewarded the readers for sticking with Tris and Tobias for three books. After all, we read to escape reality or to discover something deeper about who we are or about humanity in general. I'm not sure the ending to this series managed to accomplish that. Still, I do recognize the bravery of an author in deciding to go this way. But ... the reason that I need to drop this rating a star is because I spent some time really thinking about the themes and issues that were set up initially in the opening book of this series. These issues were never really addressed. They were dropped as new issues arose in book two. And then in book three we get a whole new set of issues. For continuity sake I feel as if the author dropped the ball in favor of a more soap opera dilemma-of-the-week approach that weakens the overall series. The characters are weaker as less time is spent on them and their individual struggles and more time is spent on the newest danger that Roth throws at them. So, anyway, I don't fall into the camp of die-hard haters out there that are spending their days trolling the amazon reviews and marking all the four and five star reviews as unhelpful while they publicly throw giant fits about the ending. But I also don't fall into the \\"this is the best book ever\\" camp either. It is not. I am somewhere in between. I see some value in the issues brought up in this final story, but I think that the execution of the entire series ultimately ended up falling flat after a solid beginning. Here's my initial review:<br /><br />Well, I'll say this ... Veronica Roth is one brave author. I can't really say why without majorly spoiling this book, but (man oh man!) that ending! There are going to be a lot of Divergent fans who are seriously angry about the way this trilogy ends. A lot. I can totally understand where those feelings would come from. I, however, can appreciate the choice that Roth makes in writing the events of this story. I don't necessarily like them, but I can appreciate them. And that is all that I can say without revealing too much. Just be prepared for a good dose of reality ... sometimes happy endings require sacrifice, and sometimes that sacrifice sucks ... big time!<br /><br />This conclusion to the Divergent trilogy is a good one. I did not re-read the first two books before I started this one, but I wish that I had. I think if the events of those books were clearer in my mind I could have appreciated a lot more of the nuanced dilemmas that crept up in this story. The alliances and motivations that guided so many people for the first two books had changed and become confusing in those stories, and so, because I did not have those stories fresh in my mind, I was having a bit of difficulty remembering who I was supposed to be trusting and who I was supposed to be angry with. I eventually remembered everything, but I do wish that I had taken the time to refresh my memory before reading. It would have made the first half of the book more enjoyable for me.<br /><br />Things I liked:<br /><br />The themes presented in this book. We finally get to figure out exactly who is pulling the strings in this new Chicago reality and what motivates the government. It is pretty creepy. In some ways I felt like it was a demented episode of The Truman Show. Creepy. There is the theme of the problem that comes about when those in authority take it upon themselves to manipulate others for \\"the common good.\\" What is that exactly, and is it ever okay to take away someone's autonomy or freedom to protect it? There is a hugetheme involving genetic research. Who are we when we discover that our genes are not \\"optimal?\\" Do our genes make us who we are or are we a product of our life experiences? So many fascinating things to thing about, and I love it when a book makes me think about my own world and my role in it.<br /><br />Tris. The tough, altruistic girl of the first book is back for this one. She has some seriously difficult choices to make. Seeing her make them in this book made me want to go back and re-read the first book, just so I could see her evolution from the very beginning. Love her!<br /><br />Tobias. Sigh. I don't know what to say. I adore this character and all of his layered personality. All I can give him is another sigh. I will always remember the way he ends this book in the epilogue. Perfect! Long live Four and all he stands for!<br /><br />Making the difficult choices. I began this review by stating that Veronica Roth is a brave author for the choices she made in writing this book. This doesn't just go for her. Her characters also have to make tough choices throughout this book. Tris. Caleb. Tobias. Peter. Matthew. Evelyn. Cara. Christina. All of them. Sometimes the choices end up well. Sometimes the choices make things even harder. But they make those choices, and I loved the bravery they showed by making them.<br /><br />So, this is a book that may end up thrown across a lot of bedroom walls when the ending arrives. Be prepared for that. But also be prepared for a beautiful story of a people overcoming great odds to find some degree of autonomy and happiness in an incredibly messed up world. I ended up truly enjoying it, and I know that this is a series that I will revisit in the future. Four stars!theme involving genetic research.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|The movie is extremely trippy.  I like that, but in particular, I love the music.  These arrangements of classic Beatles tunes that we all know so well are very good.  The vocals are excellent, and I always find it interesting to hear new interpretations of songs that are as well written as the Beatles catalogue.
1579655327|2.0|This book was a disappointment. A great concept but the recipes just don't deliver. I'm not sure some of the recipes were even tested. Hipster fluff at its finest. I would be bored out of my organic gourd in my hand knit sweater if I ever shared a table with a majority if the people featured in this jcrew inspired cookbook.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This movie soundtrack is full of wonderfully haunting music.  When I first saw the film, I was drawn to the music, more so than the storyline.  Don't get me wrong - the movie is good, but for me, it's the music that makes it memorable.  I know that there is now a Broadway show based on this film, with much of the same music.  I hope to see that show someday soon, and I've heard the cast recordings - they are very good, but there is something special about the music performed and recorded by the man who wrote much of it.  Glen Hansard is a true talent, and his rendition of these songs would be very difficult, if not impossible, to top.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|Like the previous three books in this series, the plot wends it's way through many unexpected turns and twists. If you are a fan of the television series, these tomes are a must-read. But for anyone looking to read a book in the fantasy genre, or just something extraordinary, these stories will not let you down.

B00E3IZIM0|2.0|I own tons of movies and I don't buy impulsively like I used to. From now on I only buy movies that I really like and I know I can watch repeatedly with friends and family. This movie captures my attention from beginning to end.  The blu-ray disc is flawless, high quality, I have an old 2007 hd tv, and the movie looks amazing. Not all the blu rays out there are the same, but you can see that Guillermo made sure this movie looks gorgeous. Avatar is another movie that looks amazing despite my tv being old. Other movies don't look so good, or the producers don't care to make a quality transfer to blu ray. This movie is great. I bought the version with 3d, 2d, dvd and digital. And this is why I give only 2 stars. I thought there wouldn't be a problem with the digital version. I own a mac, and an apple tv. And now I'm finding out I can't transfer the movie to iTunes. To stream the movie I have to use a website called flixster, that means I can't use it in my apple tv. This is not an apple problem because I know for a fact that I can see different types of files and movies in my video library, and best of all, I can stream them to my apple tv. I wish WB would give customers a choice and just release the digital version with apple compatibility.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am so incredibly disappointed with this final book in the series.  I understand that maybe the author was looking for a more realistic ending but I read to escape reality.  I do not want real life when I'm reading a book.  I want the characters in the books I read to have the happy ending so many of us do not get.  I wish I had stopped at Book 2 and made up my own mind about what happened next instead of reading this.  I am absolutely heartbroken.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book was good. Yes the ending is sad but I don't think it could have ended any other way without it seeming untrue to the characters. I actually expected something like that to happen.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Chris Nolan Batman trilogy has been one of the best film interpretations of a comic book character...EVER.<br /><br />That being said I do not really review movies as it's been said and done many times already here and elsewhere by people far more qualified than myself.  All I can say is that if I buy it on blu-ray, it's safe to say that I've already seen it on dvd or in the theater or in some other manner, and liked it enough to shell out the money for a blu-ray copy.  I'm an avid movie watcher and collector but my critiques of a movie shouldn't really matter much to you.  I've enjoyed many movies that critics have bashed and disliked many they have praised and often times agree with them.  it's all subjective, so watch it for yourself and if you like it enough, then you should buy it.  If my opinion really matters to you then I'll say it's an excellent movie and franchise and all 3 movies should be watched.  Great action.  Great acting.  Great story.<br /><br />I do have a gripe with the cost of new blu ray movies though.  There is no reason that blu rays should cost more than a dvd and no reason they should be at their current prices.  As far as I know, it doesn't cost much more, if at all, to produce and manufacture blu ray discs.  I understand it's a newer format...that will undoubtedly be replaced in the near future...but is that reason enough to gouge us with insane prices?  Again, blu ray DOES NOT COST MORE to produce or manufacture compared to DVDs.  The price for a completely packaged blu ray movie probably costs less than $2 and we have been charged upwards of $50...or more...for a single movie.  Ridiculous and they dare complain about losing profits to pirates.  We've all seen them market anti-piracy at the beginning of every movie.  They seem to be the biggest pirates of them all with them robbing us blind.  I understand they have a right to make profits from their creation but I think there's a difference from profiting and profiteering, and then there's just pure greed.
B00005YUNY|5.0|This is one of the best concert videos ever, by any band. Yes is on top form here and the orchestra (European Festival Orchestra conducted by Wilhelm Keitel) is more than the usual filler. A lot more. What they accomplish on tracks like Gates of Delerium and Ritual is astounding. It's just a treat to see these epics performed live, and Gates is a real test with it's ridiculous 11/8 and 21/8 time signatures. Get this wrong and the whole thing collapses. They nail it here. Only the inclusion of Heart of the Sunrise would have made this a better package, but, hey, I think I can live without it just this once! Bravo!
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I've been waiting so long for this set to be released.  I preordered it as soon as I learned it was being released.  I have to say it's really great to have this on blu ray and it was almost worth the wait...because I hate waiting.<br /><br />I don't know many who don't know about the Indiana Jones franchise and I'm sure there are many reviews already posted and many more reviews across the web from professionals as well, so i won't review the movies.  I bought them on blu ray because I love these movies and have watched them many times...many many times.  I still have them on worn out VHS copies if that tells you anything.<br /><br />Great movies but not a fan of the packaging.  The look of it is fine.  Lots of pictures and they made it resemble a book in a slipcase.  What I don't like is that the discs are wedged inbetween these \\"pages\\" and are difficult to remove.  You have to get a good grip on them to pull them out which of course leads to fingerprints and possible scratches.  It's all made of cardboard so not the most sturdy of packaging either.<br /><br />So movies, YAY.  Packaging, NAY.
B00006IU73|5.0|Mr. Wilson has put out a lot of great work since In Absentia was released, but I don't think he's done anything better than this. There's some heavy stuff here, but never less than tastefully done. In a way it is the ultimate realization of The Porcupine Tree project and the PT albums since then, although head and shoulders above what goes for prog rock these days, have become more and more akin to Steve's solo efforts (when he's not remixing in 5.1 the King Crimson and Jethro Tull catalogue). So get this and be thankful that we still have the occasional rock genius to entertain us. (Still no better PT track than Dark Matter from Signify, though!). Stars Die provides a mesmerizingly good retrospective of PT's earlier stuff.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001CI43LG Stars Die]]
B00C6B9H46|5.0|I love the movie and I won't bore you with a review of the movie except to say you should watch it if you haven't.  I have a huge movie collection and this is one of the few movies that I have and will watch several times.  That's a bit of an accomplishment in itself since I really do have a huge collection with hundreds if not over a thousand movies that I still haven't had a chance to watch yet.  It's not the best sci-fi movie by any means but it's just fun to watch and besides the Fast and Furious franchise, it's Vin Diesel at his best!<br /><br />So the quality.  I'm not an expert in video and sound transfer to blu ray but I will say it does look and sound better than the dvd version.  The picture isn't anywhere near the high definition of more current movies but it is far better than it was in dvd.  Also, it doesn't hurt that it came in a steelbook with really nice artwork and at a great price.  Extras...I don't even remember if there were any extras since I don't watch them all the time unless it's just too interesting not to watch.<br /><br />Frankly many of the extras/special feature that give that behind the scenes look just takes away from the fantasy the movie is trying to create in my opinion.  You want to lose yourself in the world that the movies create, so why spoil it by seeing that the wicked monster was nothing more than a tennis ball on a stick?  Don't get me wrong, I like having the extras but usually I'll skip on the &#34;how they did it&#34; stuff for the most part.

0143124544|5.0|My Review:<br />WARNING: This review WILL contain spoilers.<br /><br />This book was absolutely one of the best books I've ever read, but that being said, I almost wish I never read it. For those of you that follow my reviews, you know I'm a Happily-Ever-After girl. I read for the escape and the entertainment and the emotional therapy I get from books. I'll admit, I love it when a book makes me cry, but I need the hope of a happy ending.  This book did NOT have that, but it was still so good.<br /><br />This book is the story of two extremely different people: Will & Louisa.<br /><br />Will is a guy who, until two years ago, lived a huge life. He was an adventurer. He lived life to the fullest, taking huge risks with his life on an ongoing basis. That all came crashing down one rainy morning in London in the ultimate irony, when he actually decided to do the safe thing. It was pouring down rain so instead of riding his motorcycle to work, he decided to take a taxi and as he was getting into the taxi was hit by a motorcyclist. He ended up a quadriplegic. This story takes place two years later.<br /><br />Louisa is hired by Will's mother to come in and act as his companion. She's actually there to make sure he doesn't try to commit suicide....again. Louisa lives a small life. She's never left her small village and has no ambition to do so. Something happened to her seven years ago and she stopped. She stopped taking risks. She stopped putting herself out there in any manner. She also has no clue when It comes to Will. She just desperately needs the job. He's bitter and unhappy and in a great deal of pain. He doesn't want this life. Louisa's been hired for six months. What she doesn't realize for the first couple of those months is that is the timeframe Will has given his parents. They've agreed that at the end of that time, if he still wants to die, they will allow him to go into a Swiss hospital and kill himself.<br /><br />By the time Louisa finds this out, she's already begun to care about Will and they are headed toward an actual friendship. She makes it her mission for the next four months to prove to him that he still has a life to live. What happens instead is that he proves to her that SHE has a life worth living.<br /><br />This book was so good. Even as I sit here typing through tears because it does NOT end well and that is just shattering and so emotional and so heartbreaking. BUT the book is so good. It's definitely a book that will never let me go emotionally. But at the same time, I almost wish I had never picked it up.<br /><br />BUT the book does have an incredible message. Louisa was letting life pass her by and Will gave her an incredible gift by showing her other options. But the fact that she wasn't enough to make him want to live again....that hurts. But as the reader, I understood completely why Will chose what he did. The author did an incredible job of showing the pains and frustrations of this kind of life for him. As someone who's never been around someone with this kind of disability, it was eye-opening for me. The life he has after the accident is awful and it only looks to get worse as his condition deteriorates.  BUT at the same time, he and Louisa have so much fun together and they love each other. That's why I have such a hard time with this book.  The end is heart-wrenching and so emotional. Will says it was the best six months of his life. So as a reader how can I accept him throwing it all away?<br /><br />I feel a bit \\"more\\" for having read about it, but as I sit here with tears flowing down my face, I realize this is life. Sometimes there just are no good choices. But for me, I need my books to read a bit more like a fairy tale. If I want reality, I can just turn on the news. And I think most of the readers of my reviews are the same way. For that reason, I can't really recommend this book for most of them.<br /><br />If you think you can take the emotional upheaval, the book is amazing andlife-altering, but be warned. It's going to take you a bit to get over this one.<br /><br />This book gives new meaning to the term \\"book hangover\\".life-altering, but be warned. It's going to take you a bit to get over this one.<br /><br />This book gives new meaning to the term \\"book hangover\\".
B00EJU8ZIG|4.0|Caught some of Lorde's stuff on Pandora and really dug it.  I picked up the disc on Amazon, it came really quick.  The album itself is easy to listen to and there are no periods of boredom.  if you like \\"Royals\\" and \\"Team\\"- you'll like the entire disc.  I also really recommend Lana Del Ray's albums \\"Born to Die\\"  and \\"Paradise\\"- these 3 discs are all I'm listening to right now.
B0078XGEK2|3.0|This book has been around for a long time and was originally fairly inovative.  THe first part holds its own, but as you get farther along, you see how much progress has been made in understanding women and LGBT men and women.  Too much emphasis on the wonders of psychiatry.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Every now and then I feel the urge to throw my usual book selection methods out the window and read a book that is hot, hip and trending.  When I saw that Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy was chosen for the Today Show Book Club, I decided over my morning coffee,to get on the bandwagon.<br /><br />To fully understand how momentous a decision this is for me, I think I am the only woman on the planet who has never read a Bridget Jones book OR seen a Bridget Jones movie.  I do know however know that Renee Zellweger starred in the movie as Bridget.  That fact helped me to paint the picture of the adorable, confused and unorganized Bridget.  I had no clue who Mr. Darcy even was or why his fate had to remain such a big secret. Maybe that worked to my advantage.<br /><br />Bridget Jones had me at hello!  Oh, sorry.  I think that was a different movie with Renee Zellweger.  Anyway this book is a hysterical romp through the life a of woman, a friend and a mother.  I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.  Her encounter with nits had me ready to pee my pants.  Boy, I can relate to the anxiety of learning how to use Twitter while never losing a follower.  And the whole thing with her weight is every woman's nemesis.  Throw in her desire for sex and let the romp through the life if a 50 year old begin.<br /><br />Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy will brighten your spirits and make your own troubles magically disappear.  Even if you've been living under the rock with me and never heard of Bridget Jones, she'll win over your heart and your funny bone starting on page one.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Incredibly moving book, I couldn't put it down and stayed up till 2:00am to finish. The characters were rich and believable.  Five stars = must read!
0062206044|5.0|The book arrived on time. I was very happy with the book. In perfect condition and the package was easy to open.<br />Will order again from them. Really happy with the order.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really like having access to the Weather Channel since I do not have cable anymore. I wish the new version still allowed us to visit the seasonal area and storm central. There are also times when it locks up on the videos and crashes sometimes and has some bugs that still need fixing. But it loads up faster and is easier to navigate.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Wonderful movie for old and young alike. It is a Christmas tradition for our family every year to watch this movie. It reiterates the faith that it takes for a child to believe in Santa Claus.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I used to pick these cheap-o's up for around $5 bucks on Amazon -- which was the price for years!  They're great for running and working out because they're so light-weight and the sound is pretty adequate for that purpose.  They tend to break pretty easily, so I always bought a few spares.  At $5-10 each (the price varied), I thought they were worth it.  Now the price is ~$45??  That's such nonsense!  I would NEVER pay that for these headphones.  I find it insulting and disturbing that the price has jumped that high.  I refuse to be gouged like that.  I am beyond disappointed.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I think I am going to buy the series of movies they are going to make. This movie was just as good as the first one and you rarely hear that about sequels. I think this alternate universe Star Trek is better then the originals and this movie was and is better than Star Trek 2 The Wrath of Khan.
0375869026|5.0|I am loving this book.  Two thumbs up, a good read for the entire family. We can see there is a lesson in the book, and we are only in the beginning of the book. I will write more when we get through with reading it.

I did not fall asleep on it. And I wanted to see it again the next day. I want to see the original not after seeing this one. I know the both movie are 100% different but I would Like to compare the two.

B00821PCJS|5.0|I really enjoy this series. I think it is done really well. The CGI is not so over the top that it consumes the show. I think there is a very good balance. The only bad thing I have to say is that the seasons are too short. But this is done so the show won't be watered down and the episodes will have more meaningful content. 2 Thumbs up, 5 Stars.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I feel in love with Tris and Four from the moment I read the first page of Divergent. I highly anticipated Allegiant, and although I was heartbroken, I feel there was closure. I know many have been very angry with the ending, I feel the ending fit the vision. I feel some reviewers have lost sight of the fact that this is Veronica Roths vision, and I for one am grateful she shared her vision. This was a YA book, I am a 38 year old reading this and I feel the books perspective is lost on the target audience. Life is not full of rainbows and sunshine, and we as readers needed a finality to this series. And it was delivered. I still love the series and will read it many times over. Thank you Veronica for giving us Tris and Four, even if it was for a short time!!
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I love Bruno Mars' voice, but there are some songs that were not really meant for him. I felt like the more sexual sound isn't that good.
B00338QENI|5.0|Yes, it was very important to hear what happened in the past in the medical field before legislation was put in place to protect the patience.  It helps us realize why we need all these procedures today.<br /><br />The book was beautifully written and very easy to read.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I am a big fan of Divergent, so I was sad to see this installment of the series appear to unravel as it progressed. It seemed like it was rushed or something, but it was definitely not as well constructed as the first or second books. Some of the characters act completely out of character for no real reason. I am not saying that characters should not grow or change, but the changes in this book did not appear to me to be attributable to this type of development. All I can say is \\"Peter? Really?\\" I wish I could be more enthusiastic about this book, but it was disappointing when compared to the first two books in the series...
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked the book, but it did not hold my interest as well as other books have. Took me a little longer to read than the ones that really hold my interest.
B001MKQS4O|4.0|I don't know how much of this movie is real and how much is made up but the events portrayed really happened.  Capote got into the minds of the killers and did a good job of putting that into words in his book.

B00CWIMY3O|5.0|I knew from his many movies that Mads Mikkelsen would give a subtle, quietly charismatic performance as Hannibal Lecter.  Hugh Dancy  was the delightful surprise with his emotionally wrenching, carefully built-up  portrayal of the cruelly manipulated Will Graham.  Supporting actors were terrific, and the production values have been endlessly praised since the series began last spring. Extras in the set are extensive, and the short gag reel is fun,  though much of the Hannibal fandom apparently resents Mads'  few appearances in it.  This is an excellent compilation of Hannibal's first season .
1476727651|5.0|Being a #1 fan of THE MASTER, I of course bought the day of release.  I absolutely loved The Shining and knew someday more of that story would need to be told, and would be. I couldn't put the book down, I truly considered re-reading it when I was finished. That's how good the book is. It is a must read for anyone that is a fan, must read The Shining first, read, not see the movie, very big difference.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|about a doctor that was in a coma for about 7 days.  I haven't finished the book yet, however,  I find it a little boring, especially when he recalls his NDE in depth.  I understand that he tried to convey his experience in a way that would be understandable for us, people that haven't had that experience.  Nontheless, it is worth reading if you are interested in NDE and life after death.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down; from the moment I began chapter 1 all the way through to the end -- I was absolutely enthralled.  This was my first time reading a book by Liane Moriarty and I can assure you it won't be my last!  I can't wait to see what else she's written.

006202406X|5.0|It was a bit monotone in the beginning and I almost didn't read it but it got increasingly better and better until the explosion that was the end. I would recommend this but it's depressing. I gave it 4.5 out of 5.

B00AFROVQC|2.0|This book was not excellent and will appeal to people who enjoy a light read.  The main issue I have is that the story line is completely linear and there is no character development. When I say linear I mean things happen just because the author says so, none of this could happen in real life; so much so that the characters in this book do things that are completely illogical.  For example the main character looking like a peasant, breaking the rules, and injuring guards just because he wants to participate in the warrior selection process automatically has multiple princes and champions intervene and side with him for no reason.  Another example is a princess that just automatically falls head over heels for him for no real reason.  Another example is how the King takes an immediate liking to him (for thin reasons), even throws a party for him later on (again for thin reasons) yet doesn't believe him in the end?  There are many other example that show how all the characters in this book are basically 2 dimensional including the main character which makes you not really care much.<br /><br />The author uses a cliffhanger at the end of the book as a ploy to have you buy the second book.  However what led up to the end is ridiculously illogical that I decided to read reviews of the 2nd book which confirms my fear that the next book continues the same type of plot and poor character developments.  The only reason I didn't give this book 1 star is because the author is giving it out for free. I respect that, because the author is giving people a chance to see what type story he is trying to write before having them invest in the series.  Some people like this type of reading and will give the book a good rating and continue the series while others, like myself, will want something more substantial and not continue.
B00006FDCD|4.0|Okay so I'm going to get out of the way that I love this cheesy 90's made for tv movie and if I ever saw Tim Curry dressed as Pennywise coming down the street, I would pee myself and run. Or just stand there, peeing, and crying.<br /><br />That said, I am here for a more important reason. To tell you, yes YOU, all of YOU that are complaining about the HORRIBLE HALF MOVIE THAT YOU RECEIVED... To read the instructions.<br /><br />FLIP YOUR DISC.<br /><br />This dvd suffers from being old. Old technology. It's still the original dvd release from who knows when, probably way back in the Stone Age when DVDs were new. Because of this, dvd companies couldn't fit longer movies (like this one and Goodfellas, or The Godfather) on one side of a dvd. So you know what they did? They put it on what was called a &#34;flipper&#34; disc.<br /><br />Flipper discs suck and everyone hates them, mainly because you scratch the hell out of your dvd without even meaning to. It's lame. I know.<br /><br />But I PROMISE you, if you flip over your dvd, after watching the first half of the movie? YOU WILL FIND THE SECOND HALF!!!! Amazing, isn't it?<br /><br />This message brought to you from the girl that has been asked if you have to wear your regular glasses while using reading glasses, and also if 12 am is midnight or noon. I answer stupid questions. It's my life.

1608955702|4.0|The author has shown many good examples of how proper lighting make all the difference in a bad photo, or even an OK photo, and a great photo.  However, the book would have been improved with some diagrams of lighting placement and how reflected light was set up.  There are several photos of the overall scene with flash placement, but there were some instances where a diagram would have been helpful.  However, this is a minor point.  Get this book if you want to improve lighting in your photos.

0345803485|1.0|What a load of drivel. Read it to see what the fuss was about. Fine if you want to write a romance but at least attempt to weave a half interesting storyline through it. Nothing happens in this book. Same moods, same wine, same eating, same sex, same arguments over and over again. Yawn town.  I am now dumber for having read it.

She also wanted a case that folded into a stand for easy movie viewing.  She has had the case for a couple months now with no complaints at all.  She will watch her shows for hours at a time where ever she wants and it's always a pleasant experience.  Don't be afraid of the affordable price either, while the material isn't &#34;high-end&#34;, it's not cheap-feeling either.  The wake/sleep feature works flawlessly and exactly as it should.  We both recommend this case!

B0009F9O6W|5.0|What a great album.<br /><br />Until recently the only VdGG album I possessed was the now-rare as hen's teeth 68-71 compilation (on vinyl of course) and I haven't played any of my vinyl since I emigrated in '84. In my defense I *did* see them live during the Godbluff tour (at UEA if it matters).<br /><br />But a random noodle in Amazon parked me at the VdGG product page and I upped for this and a couple of others from the early years and I dug out my credit card.<br /><br />This album comes across as the most striking one of the three I bought even though I knew some of the material from the other two well. The sound has matured from H to He Who Am The Only One and The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other, as has the mixing technique - I'm not a great fan of mixes that put something into one channel with no bleed at all as so many early stereo mixes do, because it makes the headphone experience suboptimal. Here the mix is done with a proper respect for the stereo panorama.<br /><br />The sound is, as has been pointed out by others I'm relieved to find, a mix of early 70s Genesis and Early King Crimson in texture. It immediately struck me that way too. I have no idea how to explain what Peter Hamill's voice sounds like. You'll just have to sample it and see for yourself. The musicians are superb and at the top of their game, and have me excited at the prospect of getting hold of some of their later stuff. Godbluff at the very least.<br /><br />The lyrics explore many themes, but you can source discussions of them elsewhere. Suffice to say the man had a talent for poetry and a wide range of interests.<br /><br />I'll sum up the way I began. This is one of the albums I'm finding that I truly regret not having had the wit to buy when it came out so I could have listened to it over the last 40 years.

B00EDK1LP6|5.0|Great soundtrack from one of the best composers today.  A great mix of electronic, rock riffs and classic monster soundtrack themes.  You don't normally see this multi-layered composition for an action film - but del Toro always chooses his craft elements wisely.  The action pieces are great and the themes are extremely effective at conveying the underlying depth of the characters.

0385528787|3.0|I really wanted to love this book. And while I did enjoy the read (mainly for Atwood's writing style) there just isn't much here and certainly nothing here that wasn't explored much better in the first book.<br /><br />Beware, absolutely do not read this book unless you've read the first two! If you do you will be thoroughly confused and frustrated. While this book works as a somewhat tangential sequel to the original Oryx and Crake (O&C), it really is the direct sequel to The Year of the Flood (YOTF). This book essentially is narrated by Toby (from YOTF) as she tells the story of her lover Zeb (also from YOTF), who is the brother of Adam, the founder of the God's Gardeners (also from YOTF).<br /><br />The direct tie to O&C, Snowman-the-Jimmy, was in a comatose state at the end of O&C. He doesn't wake up in MaddAddam (MA) until nearly page 150 and isn't lucid enough to converse until about page 260 (out of 390 pages). He ends up being a very minor character in this book. Thus, while the 4-page introduction, covering the story so far, is nice, it just isn't deep enough to truly bring first-time readers up to speed. It does help to remind those who've read the first two books what has transpired.<br /><br />This book suffers greatly from lacking any real plot that moves the book forward. MaddAddam barely advances the story into the future and when it does, it all takes place in the last 20 pages or so. And it does so in snippets, with less than a page wrapping up the lives of various characters (e.g., Toby, Zeb, and others).<br /><br />In the current world there is only one action-related plot, and it doesn't get barely started until after page 300! It involves working with the pigoons to track down the two Painballers who had kidnapped and tortured Amanda in YOTF. To do this they have to return to the Paradice Dome where Crake created the Crakers. But it feels both rushed as well as disconnected from the rest of the novel, as if Atwood knew she had to have some action and plot and just threw it in at the end. Her focus throughout this book is first and foremost on Toby, Adam, and especially Zeb as they existed in the pre-apocolyptic world. But we've already spent two entire books in this world. So there is nothing new, exciting, or innovative about going back in time to learn Zeb's life journey.<br /><br />As for all the life journeying in the past that relates to the first two books, about all that we really learn are snippets from Adam's life, as he cuts in and out of Zeb's, and a bit of back story about Pilar's interaction with them and a very young Crake. We see how the foundation of the doomsday technology is created, stolen, protected, used (to kill a father), and eventually given to Crake. The irony as regards the world's demise is very pregnant indeed.<br /><br />I think one of my greatest disappointments is in the thematic trajectory taken by the book. It ends up coming close to being a rather simplistic back-to-nature, re-set humanity eco-utopia. While the world Atwood described in O&C was horrific, by the conclusion of MA the reader is led to see the apocolypse that has destroyed humanity was worth it. That the world is now better off with the bio-engineered Crakers, who can somehow communicate with the bio-enigneered pigoons (who are quite intelligent), and who are now fathering their own Craker-specific offsprings as well as the hybrid children of the remnants of man. Yet, thankfully, I do believe Atwood realizes that the re-set isn't permanent and that eventually the Crakers will develop like man did. Their final ability to write and read and create the Book using Words, as taught to the Craker child Blackbeard by Toby during MA, likely means what it has to us as we've written and interpreted many books over the millenium...whether it is Bible vs Koran or The Wealth of Nations vs. the Communist Manifesto, etc. Words are ideas and ideas are powerful motivators that often lead to great conflict. Of course, this onlymakes sense since a sick world that produces a monster like Crake can only produce sick offspring, even if that sickness will take a long time to come to fruition. The offspring of Dr. Frankenstein are in his image and likeness and cannot but end up in the footsteps of their creator.<br /><br />Like most trilogies, the law of diminishing marginal returns sets in with a vengeance. What was truly innovative, unique, and horrific in O&C has become rather mundane and repetitive in MA. Yes, we get to spend more time in this world and with its inhabitants, but the sense of wonder and shock is long gone. Where O&C is a masterpiece and YOTF a good read, MA seems to be mostly filler. If only Atwood had devoted MA to realizing what happened after the apocolypse rather than just re-telling the apocolypse for the third time! So...I'd recommend just reading O&C and then using your own imagination to complete the story. But if you have read O&C and YOTF then most certainly read MA. This world and these characters are worth the third book if you've read the first two. But only just barely.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|These TDKR movies are ripped almost straight from the comics, so amazing. A little pricey since I had to buy part 1 and 2, but was worth it. If you're a fan of the Frank Miller limited series/graphic novel then you need to check this out!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I could not put this book down, and literally read it in just two sittings.  Very moving and heartbreaking, and also one amazing story.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Part 2 just as good as the first part, if not better. This part is very Joker heavy. My only complaint was having to wait to see part 2.
1936608898|5.0|Change your diet, change your life?  Yes, it really is that simple.  However, in the beginning stages of changing your life, there are some deep emotional bonds to food that you have unknowingly created and to some extent food companies have manufactured you to feel.  I encourage you to give this book and the whole30 a try, I was very skeptical at first, and even failed my first whole 30.  I couldn't stop the drinking, but after noticing this was an emotional weakness not a need, I attempted my second whole 30 which has become a whole 180+ - crazy for someone who thought paleo was a bunch of bs.<br />I am a crossfitter as well and have also gained a great deal of muscle, but you must use the meal planning guide appropriately to do this.  When it says eat 5 meals as part of a workout day - you do it.  And when it says you should double up on your meat and veggies you do it.  I think the folks that hate on paleo and crossfit don't eat enough and certainly aren't paying attention to the pre/post workout meal suggestions along with the double food requirements.  Buy it, read it, live it and don't get discouraged you're changing your mind/habits it's not an easy thing to do. :)
B00CL0J99K|2.0|Not much better than Ironman 2, if even that good. The &#34;twist&#34; was terrible, such a waste for such a great actor. The first Ironman stays far and away the best in the series. 3 is just honestly not that good. Not much story here. Some rather poorly acted scenes by RDJ as he hams it up a bit to much with his nervous breakdowns and trouble sleeping...sigh...then some action...then more I can't sleep BS...then more action and on and on. Would have been able to look past it if it was as fun as Avengers, but it's not, not even close. I thought the ending was lacking as well. Had high hopes for this installment, thought it would be much darker and more serious, and nope, not at all.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I really enjoyed the Divergent series.  Allegiant is actually my favorite of the books.  99.9% will disagree with me because the book takes you on an emotional roller coaster like the one from one of those Final Destination movies.  I can understand that, but, for me, there are books that I read to escape and books I read to think.  Dystopian fiction is one of those I read to think - and Allegiant made me think.<br /><br />It made me think a lot of the dynamics of relationships - friends, family, significant other, even those we don't get along with - and the effects of said relationships upon our views.  It made me think about class divisions.  It made me think about the choice we have to participate in society or not.  It made me think about how suffering is universal.<br /><br />One of the best statements in the book for me: \\"...everyone has some evil inside them, and the first step to loving anyone is to recognize the same evil in ourselves, so we're able to forgive them.\\"<br /><br />On the negative side: The voice issues that come from the switching of the POV kept me from being able to give a full 5 stars.  I had trouble remembering who was speaking.  Nevertheless, when their voices were clear, I liked what both had to say.  I fully understand that internal dialogues rarely match the faces and actions you are shown by people - it's a life I live everyday, so Tobias/Four didn't seem unrealistic to me.
0545615402|5.0|This set was immediately devoured by the devoted Harry Potter fan who received it. I don't know if it would be of interest to anyone who has not read the Harry Potter series.
B000002AD0|5.0|I heard this cd in a store which brought back many memories. I asked if I could see it. Wrote the title down looked in the store for it could not find it so went to amazon.. it arrived in great condition. Listen to it every day in the car.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|This should have been a no-brainer 5-star rating, but since it never showed up on my Kindle HDX (despite repeated attempts), I have no choice but to give it a single star. At least it was free.<br /><br />Update: 72 hours after downloading this app, it still hasn't showed up. I've consulted with Kindle Tech support (via the \\"Mayday\\" button) and they were unable to download this app to my Kindle either. I was able to purchase another calculator app which did download and install without problems, but it isn't the one I wanted. Until and unless this problem is resolved, I have to recommend that other users of the Kindle Fire HDX skip this app -- it's not worth the aggravation.
B00E7RZEI0|1.0|I found this game enjoyable, but unfortunately my antivirus found it contains spyware 'Artemis'.  So I have uninstalled it.  Please be wary of this software.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|From the very start chock-a-block full of incredible action. &#34;UNPUTABLEDOWNABLE&#34; the whole trilogy. Every waking moment totally captured by the tale, enough to make you want to go to Sweden to experience the realistically described environment.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|After reading the sample of The Circle that was in the NY Times about a month ago, which struck me as one of the best speculative science fiction short stories I had ever read, I anxiously anticipated the release of the full novel.  Last night I &#34;completed&#34; The Circle, and while the plot and satire that I enjoyed from the sample remained strong, the writing did not seem as polished as what was presented in the NY Times.<br /><br />The Circle can aptly be described as a prequel to George Orwell's 1984.  What added a delicious piece of horror to this work was that the &#34;newspeak&#34; that is utilized by the Circlers is already in use on the web and makes the world of The Circle not that far removed from our everyday life.<br /><br />My chief criticism of The Circle was that the  book could have benefited from tighter editing.  The Circle would make for a fantastic read in middle school, to be read alongside 1984 and Brave New World, but for several gratuitous sex scenes which, though these scenes arguably serve to show the complete dysfunction of the Circlers personal lives, would not have been missed had they been excised in the final draft.<br /><br />In my opinion, The Circle is a five star idea with a three star execution. I couldn't help but feel that it had the potential to be a classic, but due to poor editing, the final draft came up short.
B00G4Q3KOC|5.0|The difficulties of surviving as a slave are proven to be frantic right from the start of \\"12 Years a Slave.\\" Thrown from abusive master to abusive master, small meal portions, tight living quarters, and if you're able to read and write you're beaten for it. You have no friends, are packed like sardines in a can whenever you're transported, and the struggle to survive nearly outweighs the urge to live. Solomon's story is absorbing because his time as a free man is spliced into the film whenever he seems to drift off into his own world while he's a slave. His family and time as a free man are his comfort thoughts when he's not able to handle the harsh world around him.<br /><br />The historical drama is immediately uncomfortable and difficult to watch as it takes little time before Solomon gets his first beating and it's just the tip of the iceberg as far as excruciating sequences go. The cast is extraordinary as you see extremely familiar faces pop up here and there; Benedict Cumberbatch as a Baptist preacher and slave owner, Paul Giamatti as a man in charge of selling slaves and getting the best price for them, and Brad Pitt as a Canadian carpenter with an Amish beard. Paul Dano continues his streak of impeccable performances. Dano's portrayal of sleaziness and smarmy characters reaches new heights in \\"12 Years a Slave.\\" He is extremely unsettling in the film.<br /><br />The two standouts of the supporting cast are Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey and Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps. Patsey picks the most cotton out on the field every day and Master Epps (Fassbender) takes a liking to her because of it. Nyong'o's suffering bleeds through in her performance in every gesture and facial expression. Patsey's journey is heartbreaking and you feel it deep within your soul. Her whip lashing later on in the film is powerful, agonizing, and nearly unbearable to watch without flinching. Fassbender has this demanding yet frightening presence on screen. Epps is a drunk with a short-temper and treats his slaves like property. He is physically and sexually abusive and just the devil reincarnated as far as slave owners go.<br /><br />But of course the real gem of the film is Chiwetel Ejiofor. The English actor has so much talent and has been in several recognizable projects already, but the down side is nobody knows who he is. He will be a mainstay in the public eye after \\"12 Years a Slave.\\" Ejiofor is an absolute beast in the film. If you weren't already sitting down, Ejiofor's performance would bring you to your knees because it's so devastating. The extended shots in the film, those ones that seem to last forever while everyone pretends not to see the disgusting event taking place right before them, will haunt you. The over the shoulder shots of kids playing in the background while someone is hanged. It's depressingly mesmerizing. Thinking on your toes has never meant more than during this film.<br /><br />\\"12 Years a Slave\\" is a soul crushing experience. It's a film featuring no humanity and no kindness only damnation and desperation. You won't be the same after viewing it. It's as if a piece of you is left behind once it's over. \\"12 Years a Slave\\" strips you naked, verbally abuses you, puts you in restraints, and whips you bloody until you're so battered and beaten you think you're going to die. Then it ties a noose around your neck and hangs you out to dry. As you choke and gasp for air and begin to turn blue, the ropes loosen slowly. A small glimmer of hope emerges and you can breathe again. You will live to see another day, but your life will forever be changed because of it.<br /><br />\\"12 Years a Slave\\" will leave you broken and it's difficult to imagine a repeat viewing, but it's also the most respectable and melancholy experience you'll have this year. \\"12 Years a Slave\\" is an outstanding triumph in filmmaking since it's so unbelievably captivating yet will leave you feeling so undeniably uncomfortable as it takes pride in ripping yourmortality to shreds over the course of two hours.mortality to shreds over the course of two hours.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|A truly remarkable book. It's filled with simple yet strong language. Full of life lessons and great quotes tying everything together from religion to superstition to war showing that everything no matter what it is, is tie together in the world. A must read for anyone!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I truly thought that this book was just absolutely the best book I have ever read. Is there going to be a sequel? Because then I want it.
0385751532|5.0|I got this book for my son for summer reading. He loved it.. This book held his interest.  We even watched the movie after he read the book..  This is a good read..
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I literally have not enough words to explain how deeply broken and sad this book leaves me. But at the same time, I think there wasn't any chance for it to be different or better, thanks Veronica.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Sorry about the cheesy line but this movie was great.  A bit on the morbid side but the acting and singing were spectacular.  I thought I wouldn't like it when the singing started but you realize after you watch it that the contrast to the singing and the dark storyline is what makes the film.  I will watch this a bunch of times throughout the year and never get sick of it.
B00C5R8364|2.0|While the book was full of history on Al Qaeda and middle east I was not too impressed with the flow of the book.  I think it would have been better published as a history book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Thus game is fun and interesting. It is very addictive. I like that it is by age. I recommend it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The novel follows an Afghan family over generations and weaves a rich tapestry of characters and events resulting in a jewel of a book. Khaled Hosseini's writing draws you in, doesn't let you go and leaves you at the end wishing that he had written more. Some of his writing has an almost fairy-tale poetic quality in stark contrast to his evocative and vibrant descriptions of life and characters in different places and cultures across the continents.<br />Khaled Hosseini has a striking abiity to portray people in all their strengths and weaknesses dispelling the myth that good people do only good things and bad people only bad. There are so many nuances in the portrayal of the characters that you feel as though you have granted real insight into people. There is a heartfelt understanding of the dilemmas people face in their lives and how the choices made and actions taken are part of human nature.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Who doesn't love watching handsome men in suits and the characters are so strong I just love this show. I also love the fact that they placed a woman in charge of the entire firm.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Loved the shifts in point-of-view and the captured innocence and fire of young love. Rowell lets you relive the days of mix tapes and bus stops, before you were worried about love lasting forever, but when you were still so convinced it would.
1932907009|3.0|SAVE THE CAT! is about making money, not about making art. If you want to read about a bag of tricks that will increase your odds of making a ton of cash, this it. If you want to learn about the finer nuances of artistic, passion-filled creative writing, you should skip this one.<br /><br />I admit, I have never heard of \\"Blank Check\\" or \\"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot\\" (4.7 and 3.7 on IMDB, respectively). However, not only did Blake Snyder sell each script for over a million dollars, each, but both movies grossed around thirty-million dollars, each. Despite Snyder's continuous name dropping throughout this book, he does produce some artistic chops: twenty years in the industry, and (again) making millions in writing scripts.<br /><br />Snyder's approach is VERY formulaic--and opinionated. He's watched and studied countless films, figuring out his own formula for success. The title of his book comes from one of the coined phrases he uses in chapter 6. He says all good movies should have a \\"save the cat\\" moment where something happens (like saving a cat) that makes the hero likable. Snyder says \\"Tomb Raider 2\\" was a dud because it lacked a \\"save the cat\\" moment.<br /><br />I can't argue with Snyder because a lot of what he says makes sense. Some people may have difficulty submitting to his logic or confining themselves to his reasoning, but Snyder does prove it works. Just be prepared to follow his exact logic, such as making your \\"catalyst\\" moment shows up on page 12--not page 11 or 13. Yes, I'm serious. He tells you how many pages to have and what should appear on which page. All loglines have to contain irony and you must be a slave to the logline. Work the plan, earn the money.<br /><br />Beside his coined phrases in Chapter 6, Snyder has also gained some notoriety for breaking every movie into one of ten genres. What's weird is that \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"Die Hard\\" fall into the same genre. Snyder makes sense in his definitions, but it's going to rub many people the wrong way.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Snyder proves his merit and shows how a successful script can be done. Personally, I didn't enjoy his arrogance (he was \\"shocked\\" that fellow script writers couldn't quote lines from their favorite movies) and I don't appreciate locking down an art form to a formula. Can you make a lot of money following his advice? Sure. Will you feel good doing so? I don't know.<br /><br />Three stars for some interesting advice that anyone can cull from. Two stars knocked off for money-hungry structuring.e wrong way.<br /><br />At the end of the day, Snyder proves his merit and shows how a successful script can be done.

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Harold was a unique character on a trip of self discovery finding the meaning of friendship and relationships.  Would recommend the book for  light reading.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I realty like this game. It has a lot its cool stagees. Two thumbs up. Grate game. I just wish they gave more free special moves.... all in all grate.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|We read this book for book discussion.  Most of the group said it moved so slow. Overall the group would not have chosen this book to read.
0316322407|5.0|I wanted to read about this young woman who has worked so hard to continue the education of women in her country.  Where do I start with admiration and caring for this brave young woman it starts within my heart!  I am Malala!
006202406X|1.0|I personally thought this book was lazy. Don't bother buying it if you really enjoyed the first two books. The plot on the whole of this third book is like something that's been done thousands of times in other stories. Similar to where the character wakes up and realizes everything was a dream (not quite, but it may as well have been). It didn't match up to the complexity and in-depthness as the first two books were. I was very disappointed.
0385350864|2.0|After reading the first two Bridget books, I had such high hopes for this one.  The character of Bridget in the first books was goofy and endearing; but by the age of 50 she should have aged a bit and been less frazzled, disorganized, slutty, immature and unlikable.  I did not like Bridget Jones in this book; and her continual texting/twitter drove me insane.  I do not see why Mr Wallaker had any interest in her whatsoever.  Stupid book.  Do not waste your time!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It never feels the same every time I play it.  Has kept my very entertained.  Game play is great.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Downloaded this game months ago and still can't stop playing. The goals and challenges keep it interesting, and it's super cute to boot. Fun for all ages. Only downside is that you can only earn 5 coins a day.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Good matching game addicting. The only thing that sucks is that you only get five lives and then you have to wait to get more.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The story pulls you in almost immediately, the author paints a convincing picture of the world he has created. I caution you though, you will lose hours in this book, then you will move on to the second book \\"A wise man's fear\\", fly though that and be left waiting for the third book like the rest of us.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I downloaded this game to see what the hype was all about.  It was entertaining at first but I lost interest quickly.  It is a great time waster if you are waiting for your significant other to try on clothes or shoes since it can be a quick game.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Love the characters and the fun story!<br />You are back to your good writing!!<br />Loved it<br />always been a fan but some of your books more than others !<br />My all time favorite:<br />THE STAND
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game has great graphics, lots of options and fun for all ages and levels. I even love the holiday update.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Highly addictive and challenging. Don't think you should have to wait for friends or pay for higher levels. I let my daughters play and now they love it too.
B005R32L66|3.0|Simply put, the version provided by the Amazon App Store is probably the last version of the app that actually works like it's supposed to for me. The updated one on Google play changes so much and broke so many things that it is literally unusable for me. Considering that I only use the app for IM, the extra 'fluff' in the form of calls and video really don't do anything for me.<br /><br />Prime example as follows:<br />- Previously on my HTC One SV, I typically typed IM's in landscape mode. On THIS version of Skype, that is no problem. On the current version on Google Play, that is a HUGE problem, because the enter key no longer actually sends the instant messages. Skype did provide a &#34;send&#34; key on the software, but it's only visible when I flip the phone back to portrait mode.<br />- Skype is a notorious battery hog. from my own measurements, just having skype running can take a minimum of at least one hour's worth of usage from a given phone battery away, and usually more. So is this one, but at least this build still works.<br />- The &#34;current&#34; version of Skype offered on google play refuses to exit properly, and keeps trying to rather obnoxiously restart itself even when you don't want it.<br /><br />I want to give this version offered on Amazon a better rating. I really do. But the fact that google play keeps obnoxiously trying to force me to update to the 'new' and worse one, I can't really talk about any prior version of skype without bringing up all the bad experience that I keep having with the current build of the program. If anyone in charge of making Skype is even reading this, I'd have plenty of ideas on how to make it not suck again.
B00821OW8K|1.0|Anyone who has had any training what-so-ever in film, can spot \\"bad acting\\".<br /><br />This show should simply be titled \\"Bad Acting\\", because it is absolutely horrible.  Even if I were a 10 year old (who use to love extraterrestrial invade Earth-types), the acting is terrible.<br /><br />There is a new standard in acting now, it is called \\"Breaking Bad\\".  Really makes this show sub-par.<br /><br />I just love all the smiling in this show, despite the fact that aliens have taken over Earth, and killed many of their family members. These actors (I mean, huk characters) have such great attitudes about Earth coming to an end...
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie was just downright great!  Extremely fun and exciting to watch.  The entire cast of this movie worked fantastically together and contributed to why the movie was such a pleasure to watch.
B00AW57L96|5.0|thoroughly enjoyed this book! a mixture of emotions made this read something I was looking forward to each time I picked it up.<br />Clever writing in my humble opinion.<br />Happy to recommend!
B00FEN1C50|3.0|Kick and punch special effects, little to no science fiction, lots of meaningless dialog. Kick and punch? Really? If you like robot kick and punch, you will probably like this movie. If you want science fiction, this is not it. Overall, just sort of silly and certainly would not endure all the dialogue to watch effects again. Date movie? No. Viewing with spouse? No bad language or actually bloody violence, so I guess. Guys only?? Maybe, cause lots of dialogue time for pee breaks. No recommended.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|I thought Matt Damon should get an emmy for playing Liberace's boyfriend. He was absolutely great !  I thought the Dvd was done very well and I did like it.

B0014W0E1S|1.0|I wanted this movie because I like it but the copy I was sent is faulty. It has Spanish writing on the front and will not play in my machine. I don't think it has been produced for North American machines. The other DVD's I received all play so I know it isn't due to a problem with my DVD player.<br />How do I return this bad copy for a good one??????
B008B3MZNI|3.0|Their Breakfast iin America parts are what make this video good. Its not great because other than the music of their best record, the rest is unremarkable. i had always wanted to see them live and now that I have seen them, I would have sugested that they stick exclusively with Breakfast in America, it would have been a shorter but stronger show.

B001EBV0OY|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is quite possibly one of the greatest films ever.  It is entertaining through and through and gives a glimpse of the lives of long term prisoners that many people will fortunately, never know.<br /><br />First rate performances by all the actors, especially Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.<br /><br />A story of redemption, corruption, honesty, and friendship which is unsurpassed elsewhere.<br /><br />To put it simply, when this movie comes on TV, I set down to watch it.
1594746036|4.0|I read it in one day. Fun, easy read. It would be an especially good book for parents trying to get kids to read! Don't be put off by 'creepy' cover picture; this book is not scary...think 'super powers' as opposed to ghosties. Enjoy!
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Fascinating subject, well-written, but too long a build- up toward the main action. I really had to slog through the 1st 1/3 of the book. It did get better & more engaging but I mainly stuck with it because it was my book club read & at the urging of 2 friends. I'm sort of glad I stuck with it because I did gain insight into the Kafka-sequel world of North Korea.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is what every woman wants. A man that protects her, a man that only notices her. Great book.  Ready to start on the last one.

0544104404|5.0|Fresh, up-to-date, full of stats. I think it is worth reading for every parent having a new born or grown up.  It compares the personality and skills of children coming from: wealthy family, low income, private schools, public schools, single parent.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|SPOILERS INCLUDED<br /><br />I never write reviews, but I'm so disappointed with this last installment of a promising series, that I had to voice my feelings. Basically, readers shouldn't waste their time with this book.  They should just re-read the first book, Divergent, if they want a good read and another dose of the Divergent world.<br /><br />When I first read Divergent, I was excited and in awe.  I had to tell my husband the whole plot line.  When I read Insurgent, my excitement died down somewhat. I thought the plot was muddled and I was irritated with Tris' angst and \\"woe is me attitude.\\" However, the ending was a cliffhanger, and I remember shouting \\"WHAT???!!!\\" out loud after the last chapter. So I still had high hopes for the third and last book.<br /><br />Like others, I thought the POV changes were not written well. Tris and Tobias' voices were the same.  Even when I read Free Four and The Transfer, short stories from Four's POV, I thought his voice was weak and too similar to Tris.  Instead of making me like him more, I became bored. Maybe I just like him more as a \\"man of mystery\\" like he was in the first book.  Getting in his head ruined it for me. Maybe because he was so much cooler in my imagination.<br /><br />More importantly though, Allegiant didn't make me feel anything. Even with the tragic ending, I just muttered \\"humph\\" to myself. No tears, no strong emotions, nothing. And I'm a crier. I cried when Rue died in the Hunger Games, and she wasn't even a main character. I cried during the Budweiser commercial with the owner raising his horse and eventually having to give him away. I understand why the author chose the ending she did, and the meaning behind it, but it was not executed well.  I think what happened was instead of making me more attached to Tris and Tobias, Allegiant pushed me away from them. I didn't particularly feel their love for each other, or the love the other characters had for them. All the interactions they had with the other characters were to drive forward the plot, not deepen relationships or develop character.  For crying out loud, Peter didn't do anything, didn't say anything, until over half way through the book.  He's with the main characters the entire time, but is as important as a chair in the room. I felt like the author completely forgot about him until she wanted to make a point about him and treat him as a foil to Tobis' character and choices at the end of the book.<br /><br />Overall, I feel very let down by this series. It started off great, then just went downhill. It's not because of the \\"tragic/sad\\" ending. It's because what was supposed to be a tragic/sad ending, just wasn't. I felt no emotion. I appreciate the meaning the author tried to convey in the book, but without my emotional attachment, it wouldn't have mattered if she had made the most profound point in literary history.<br /><br />The only other series I felt so much disappointment for was the Sookie Stackhouse series. Another series that started out great and then got worse and worse until I didn't even bother reading the last installment. I wish hadn't read this last installment of the Divergent series either.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Not sure of quality or condition as the cd is sealed and meant for my daughter in November . I will post more if not happy with product or daughter has issues with product.
B009OYTIXS|4.0|The Green Arrow has always been a tough DC hero to make sense of. His combination of easy good nature and deadly force call to mind the simpler days of comics, when heroes would riddle spies, foreigners, and indians with lead at the drop of a hat, while his almost nonexistent back-story basically makes him seem like a lunatic who hunts criminals for sport. Arrow wisely revises all of this, giving the Green Arrow a welcome overhaul in all areas. Oliver Queen is now the sole survivor of a doomed sea voyage, tasked by his father with returning home to Starling City and stopping a nefarious but unidentified plot. This is complicated when he washes up on a deserted island full of homicidal mercenaries, where he spends the next 5 years. This time hones him from a careless, deceitful rich boy into a deadly avenger, and upon his return he must reconcile both identities, while putting arrows in an awful lot of bad guys.<br /><br />Arrow flips between Queen's time on the island and his crime-fighting in the present. Events in the two arks parallel one another somewhat, but not so much that it's worth being hung up on. Both periods are impeccably written and surprisingly dark, especially considering the source material. We also see quite a few faces from DC's rogues gallery in both past and present. Some, like Count Vertigo and Merlyn the Archer are substantially retooled, while others, like Deathstroke and Deadshot are pretty recognizable. The present storylines also focus on Queen's family and friends, all of whom are entrenched in the same web of deceptions and plots he is. It would seem jarringly soap-ish after all the action, but it's so well written, and the cast does such a good job, that all the extra drama is fully justified.<br /><br />Beyond being a competent drama/thriller, Arrow has pretty top notch action too. The fights are well choreographed, lots of people get shot with arrows, and there's some pretty big set-piece destruction. In an extreme rarity, firearm silencers even make the correct noise, although this accuracy is offset by the Arrow's insistence on closing to within 20 feet to shoot people with his bow (presumably because a show about the hero sniping his enemies from hundreds of feet away would be less exciting).<br /><br />The only real complaint I can level against Arrow is that there seem to be two distinct forces present in its creation. One of these authorial voices wants a dark, Nolan-esque hero thriller with as much blood and mayhem as can be allowed on TV, and the other wants desperately to sell Arrow to the 13-17 crowd. As a result the show, and its characters can seem a little schizophrenic- the arrow shoots bad guys by the morguefull but kills almost none of them, villains offer up gleeful plans to murder whole families to set examples yet instantly relent when asked nicely, and everyone is happy to take time out from their kidnappings/vengeance sprees/international terrorism to engage in some maudlin family moments. It can be quite jarring, although not wholly inappropriate in a TV show based on a comic book.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Great effects and big budget look and feel<br />-Fantastic cast, including some recognizeable names like Colin Donnell and John Barrowman<br />-Good action and compelling storytelling<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Seems confused about its target audience<br />-Deviates strongly from its source material, which will anger pedants
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i love this book it keeps my son busy and i really love roman and greek mythology to so i recommend this book for all ages!

B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Beth Hart is the greatest singer alive! Joe Bonamassa is a guitar prodigy the likes of which nobody has seen since Stevie Ray Vaughn. You must get this album!
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|I was really glad I could get this DVD and have it in my collection, I only got to see half of it on TV and now I can see the whole movie. It came in the mail really fast.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been playing it on other sights and LOVE it!  Each level is a new challenge and it is fun to see you friends scores.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Good pace.  Kept my interest.  Not sure how many lawyers give up a 300,000 a year job.  Street life, ambulance chasing and hustling clients made the story.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I loved reading this better then watching the movie. This is a wonderful classic that I am glad to have in my collection of Kindle books.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a good game if u like matching games. this game I use all my spare time playing this game. I love this game.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Amazing graphics, hidden objects, brain games, never-ending twists. Very entertaining. Keeps you coming back for more every day. Must get back to adventure
B001DHXT6G|5.0|True it has been modified, but not in a bad way. The changes take nothing away and make it possible for my grandchildren to enjoy it as much as I. This set will successfully introduce this classic to a whole new generation of Trekies!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So addicting and a great stress reliever! :) keep up the good work :) only thing I would change is make the costumes cheaper. other than that, 5stars :)
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use coming from a Word background. It took just a short time to get used to the features and they were very useful. If I used it more often I am sure I would discover other features that would be helpful. I used it on vacation and emailed the file to my home computer.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a fun game to play.  Need a lot of practice  to be good at it.  I am enjoying the game.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I went in with an open mind.  I ignored all the critical movie reviews and gave it a watch on Amazon Prime Rental.  I actually found it worth viewing and enjoyed it enough that I will probably end up purchasing the movie on Blu-ray or on Prime.<br /><br />Well I came back to this after my initial review last year and decided this M. Night Shyamalan and Will Smith collaboration will probably fair well over time.  Parents may actually enjoy it more, because they know boys usually don't start out as brave as they think they are.  Once they accept that, then they become young men.<br /><br />May 2017<br />With more viewings I have decided it was underrated. This a discovery film not unlike Enemy Mine [[ASIN:B000I9YXOC Enemy Mine]]. A father must discover how to motivate a son he hasn't truly understood. The son although his relationship with his father is not all about leadership and he realizes he must respect his fathers knowledge in order to survive. I purchased the digital version.<br /><br />CA Luster
B00BWU0S3Q|5.0|I waited a while to watch this one, since nobody else in my house hold wanted too... it was worth the wait... lost of action and the actors were top notch !!  recommend this movie if you like the gangster type movies...
B00F91RYL8|4.0|A different twist on a Zombie movie. Imagine people change very quickly and when they turn they can move very fast.  Not your typical change after a bite and eventual death.  No, it's more like a rapidly spreading virus.  No shuffling Zombies here, they can come fast and in waves.  More intense than many typical Zombie movies and even more helpless feeling of fighting the spread of the disease.  At least rent it if you enjoy Zombie or horror movies.<br /><br />CA Luster
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Makes you really wonder how it may really happen,,, great effects and actors... liked it,, good zombie movie,, Brad Pitt played his part to a T !!!  would recommend this movie !
1603420398|4.0|I've used about 8 patterns so far with no problem. Haven't found any errors. I love having the diagrams + writing instructions.
1416595236|1.0|I know this is genre fiction, but so many others do it better.  This is hack writing at its worst.  Everything is black and white, the characters are more like caricatures, and the action is gratuitously violent.  I am sorry to hear that Mr Flynn has died, but the literary world will not miss him.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Yep its star trek & awesome. Nothing else to say about it other than to fill in text for the review.
B004JC16LC|5.0|The other reviewers have exhaustively covered the contents of this set so I won't repeat the information in this review. I would simply say that my box set had no scratched or defective discs and the presentation of the discs in subsets was very helpful and logical. This box set is worth every penny for the Wagner performances alone. The rest is icing on the cake. The sound quality is exemplary considering the age of the recordings. Buy it before it goes out of print.
0596101996|3.0|Hasn't been as helpful as I had hoped. A hard read. Not much else to say just filling in text.
B002PJ8AE2|2.0|The car came with a loose (broken) wheel.  Because it was for my daughter's 9th birthday, and she waited for it.  She says to me mom it's okay.  For me not happy!
1603425381|5.0|I have used about 12 of the patterns so far and haven't found any pattern errors. No problems using the patterns. It's a great book to flip through for border inspiration.
0449000729|4.0|long, theoretical but an interesting view of history from the perspective one family.<br />Worth reading if you enjoy a different way off looking at the world
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|it doesn't have to be a tragedy every season.  How about trying a bit of joy and happiness, instead of all the misery.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|I do not know why I didn't pay attention when I bought these discs.  I thought I was replacing a single DVD I had lost.  I was pleasantly surprised to find my old friend from the 50's included!  I have not watched it all, but I will!  The movie is great, as always.
630542828X|5.0|Great buy amazing movie, every civil procedure student should see and own I recommend the purchase of civil action and enjoyed the message.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy they have candy crush on the kindle now. It's much better on the bigger screen then on my phone. Can't stop playing it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|pros:<br />-big buttons<br />-memory<br />-hardly any adds<br /><br />cons:<br />-whenever I go into the app, it always gets kind of slow and glitchy.<br /><br />that's the only problem I have with the app. other than that, its a really good simple calculater.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|So the first time I played this game was at my friends house and I loved it expelled the airplane one is not good on Kindles but other than that I love LUV LUVE it!!!!
B003F44QRQ|5.0|Shared this classic 80s flick with my kids and they enjoyed it, they didn't feel the love that I think they should, but they liked it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|The game is a interesting game I thought. The updates seem to always bring something exciting  to the game. Keep up the good work!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was worried that it wouldn't be as good as the others after reading other comments, but I loved it!  I am glad to see Tris get her tough girl image back in this book. Tris and Tobias' love is still strong throughout the book. I thought the twist would be a break up with them once they leave the fence and new relationships would form with the new characters they meet, but I am glad I was wrong. Many others commented about the ending being bad or not right, but I believe it was complete and left me feeling like I got great closure to this trilogy. I sooo wish someone would make a movie out of these books.  They would be a huge success!  Thank you Veronica for these three wonderful escapes from reality for all of us busy moms who just want to relax and curl up with a great book. I hope that you will continue to make many more similar to these.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is great fun.....and allows me to forget the pressures of the day. Daily tension melts away with every bubble that bursts.
B00992CF6W|1.0|It sucks peoples it rips you off Pc version is better and it updates 1 a month or year it is a ripoff. RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Cassandra Clare captured me with the first book..............and totally intrigued me with the second book. I saw the movie adaptation for City of Bones and I am anxiously awaiting the release of City of Ashes!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|The Pretty Little Liars books are so excellent! I am going to read all of them, one right after another. I am obsessed! Once you read one, you will be hooked. 5stars!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is fun to play and trying to make just the right match is not as easy as it looks.  The rules about the game and the different bonuses could be explained a little better but all in all I recommend it.
0525478817|5.0|Heart-breakingly beautiful. Green's writing has you invested in characters instantly as well as long after you are done reading. Once you read this book, it will stay with you. You will cry, you will laugh, you will hate John Green a little and then love him all the more for bringing this story to you.
B000ME5B30|5.0|truth presented simply.  an inconvenient truth tells the other side of the false premise. so be it told with plain language.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Our whole family enjoys this game, we will play for hours on end!  We love it! Only thing I am not happy about is my nieces can get free tokens for watching videos on their iPad and we cannot on our kindle, which in order to complete certain missions you need tokens and to buy them gets expensive, but overall I would absolutely recommend this game if you are looking for a cute game that anyone of any age can enjoy!!
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I had all the restaurants and then one day during an update PlayFirst went and locked most of them up. They now want me to pay for them. This is theft, plain and simple. Amazon should not allow them to pull this kind of sleazy move.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I love the Indiana Jones movies! My last set was on VHS so need I say more? I kept looking to buy them at Wal-Mart but it was never in stock. I got it fast and I'm thrilled.
0802473156|5.0|Great insight and useful information on how to communicate w your partner.  Really teaches you in a reader friendly way. NOT a dry read!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|While I must say I'm not a fan of how this book ended, I felt more let down by the book as a whole. Divergent was an amazing story with a great plot line. Insurgent was almost as good but it did introduce a bit too many characters and the plot was a bit shaky. But Allegiant is in a whole other realm! There were so many characters I often had to stop and try to remember who was who and I really didn't feel a connection to them , they were under developed. The plot was too fast paced. It was almost like Roth should have wrote another book so she could have really worked on developing the society that lived outside the gates. Due to the fast paced plot it allowed for many holes to develop which just left me dissatisfied in the end. I really wanted to love this book and I'm really sad that Roth just seemed to have breezed through it without keeping it up to par with the other two books. I suggest that if Hollywood ever makes Allegiant into a movie that they do some serious reconstruction to the plot and hopefully a change to the ending.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|this is classic elton john!  this cd is a must have for any elton john fan!  hope it wins some grammies!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am hooked on this game! Some levels are fairly easy while others are a real challenge. Keeps me coming back for more!
B00DXP0QX0|5.0|this cd is classic rod stewart!  this cd will be a classic for any fan of his and fan of classic rock music!
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|No rave reviews here for Hangover Part III. It looked to me like it was just something the producers ad-hoc'ed together to cash in one last time on the popularity of the original movies. Maybe I'm missing a broader perspective. The situational comedy that made the first two movies as popular was definitely missing. Give it a try if you like though, everyone has different tastes when it comes to entertainment. The giraffe getting his head knocked off going through the underpass was a little funny in a weird kind of way (spoiler alert). Having said all that, if you're a follower of the Hangover trilogy go ahead and give it a try. At the very least it's a good way to occupy an hour and 41 minutes of your time.
B007STBUIW|5.0|This film has lost nothing of it's original power and now it's looking the best it ever has. The picture transfer is really, really good and so is the audio.<br />The original, the best, and you need this!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Have read lots of reviews about this device, also managed to purchased high quality earphones sure 215, sounds incredible nice what you pay for, if you after extremely high quality sound then I would recommend Fiio E12
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Could have given more time to figure out without giving too much away.  Liked the map that showed pictures of each location.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is Lots of fun and a great way to pass the time. Great game for kids or adults.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|We really like this movie and my boys (4 & 2) love the little stuffed monkey \\"Belt\\" toy.  The toy has velcro on his hands so he can hold on to your arm or wherever.  Arms aren't long enough to go around a waist.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved if. It was different but enjoyable. Good tie in from book 1 and good flow into book 3.  I wish there was a book 4.
B0009P5YXO|2.0|I was really hoping for a bit better quality. I know this wasn't very expensive, but this is essentially just a fancy looking $0.50 pen.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love that I can now play candy crush on my Kindle Fire HD, I had downloaded app months ago but it was not available for playing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was happy to find this on my Kindle. I'm still not sure if I love this app or hate it. I may know when I complete the next level.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is seriously addicting.<br /><br /> I have yet to spend money on anything in this game and I've been able to unlock ponies such as Rarity. I am of the belief the other people are impatient to &quot;beat the game&quot;<br /><br />My only issue is that after the Equestria Girls/Nightmare Night update I've been seeing ads for the stuff on this app, yet there's no update for us.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Have been reading all the Reacher novels in publication date order. This has to be one of the best ones. Gripping! Loved it
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Oh my...<br /><br />After this book, I hate that line.<br /><br />Shall I list more qualms? Just a few.<br /><br />Overuse of adverbs after \\"said\\" words. Dryly. Overuse of odd synonyms for words that are more fitting--flow is constantly interrupted. Overuse of Victorian Age-old words in dialogue in all characters that's laughable.<br /><br />Plot is ok; the mystery in Christian's character is good. However, both characters repeat certain phrases an annoying number of times to the point where a lovable mannerism or quirk becomes flat and disposable.<br /><br />Overuse of exclamation points--writing and sentences and style should take care of that, but it's lost in the ellipses and italics, too.<br /><br />Oh, and her inner goddess and not-so-subconscious subconscious voices are highly annoying. To me, these show an inability to completely grasp the complex psychology of such a storyline and set of characters, and is an easy (and overly telling, not showing) out to this endeavor, so it fails.<br /><br />SPOILERS.<br /><br />Some things were good, but scenes like the gliding at sunrise were so under-described and lacked beauty.
0375842209|5.0|I purchased this book for my 12 year old. She is reading this book in her English class and is enjoying the story .  I will probably read it after her!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|So I initially I bought this book only because I wanted to read it before the movie came out in the coming year. It also had positive reviews and a few friends concurred that reading this was worth it.<br /><br />To say the least I cannot imagine reading this only once in my life. I will read it again and again. The wit among the characters the strong sense of reality and human interaction that would actually occur in real time was amazing to read. This book was hardly what one would think about teens with terminal illness all sappy and full of pity. It was uplifting and eye opening and made you think about each character in a depth that most books cannot touch.<br /><br />Wonderful read. Wonderful message. Buy it.
0316201561|5.0|My daughter loved this book! She is not easily entertained, but couldn't wait to tell me all about it at the end of each chapter. Very clever story
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great game, graphics are good and sound is good. No need to spend money in game all upgrades can be achieved during game play.
1612130607|1.0|I wanted to like this trilogy. No, I really did.  I read glowing reviews that it was a modern romance with a little kink thrown in for flavor.  Okay, I can deal with that but a few pages in I had to stop.  Seriously, did a fifty year old woman really write this?  It read like the overwrought prose of a fifteen year old drama queen. The repetition was nauseating and puerile.  It made it difficult to read.  I kept wanting to Frisbee which ever book I was reading.  Still, I trudged on.  Okay, I stalled when I tried to wrap my mind around Ana's virgin ignorance.  Somebody report her parents!  Obviously they kept her vacuum sealed somewhere, letting her out only to go to classes.  It would explain the breadth of her stupidly regarding sex--and well computers too.  It might also explain why she was emotionally stunted and possessed of all the sparkling wit of a toadstool.  As to her inner monologue between the goddess and subconscious--well there are no words strong enough to express how much I hated that device.  I can only say that I was grateful that E.L. James was no where near me at the time.  I abhor violence but I was overcome with the desire to really bitch slap that woman.<br />  And speaking of our distinguished British author, what the hell is wrong with you? Not only is E.L. an abysmal writer but she is also not big on doing research either. If you can't be bothered to check out the geography and consistently pepper your novels with British-isms, why is your trilogy set in the USA?  Your main characters are obviously British so why bother with the pretense?  Is it laziness or are you under the impression that all the kinky people live in America?<br /> And speaking of kink, what were you thinking about when you created Christian Grey?  For the record, mutually enjoyed kink between consenting adults is a wonderful thing.  Whatever happened between Mrs. Robinson and Christian is Sexual Abuse of a Child.  Let's not sugar coat it.  So you wrote this character thatwas abused by his mother, her pimp, and his foster mother's best friend. Christian got the trifecta.  However, that doesn't excuse the fact that he is a sadistic douche-bag.  Grow up and get over it Christian baby.  As far as i can tell, the reason he got his kink on and beat on pretty brunettes was to punish mommy over and over.  That's the wrong mindset for the BDSM life-style. For the most part, people in that life tend to stay clear of emotionally compromised individuals.  Anyway, Christian hurts women because he was hurt.  Yep, classic transference. That makes him a four star bastard.  Don't blame the kink when you oughta see a shrink.  Sorry--couldn't resist that.  Here's the thing; I didn't like the main characters.  They were both hopelessly shallow and as substantial as rice paper.  He needed MAJOR therapy and she could have used a dose or two herself.  News flash people--you can't fix broken.  The love of a good woman does not set you on the road to mental health.<br />  Speaking of mental issues what's up with the time line in these books?  First I can't believe how incredibly fast she gave up her virginity before she had any facts.  Are you nuts?? But all three novels span about three months.  So let's see, Christian goes from no touchy touchy to happily married in that short of time.  Hmmm. All those years of being screwed up in the head just--evaporated.  Wow!  What?!!  Was Ana really that potent?  Hey maybe we should send her to Iraq.  There are some serious male to female issues over there that could use some transformation.<br /> Bottom line--Christian was abusive and he shouldn't have been allowed to do what he did.  Ana was an enabler who was confused about the difference between mutually enjoyable kink and abuse.  They were both so immature they made my teeth hurt. Why couldn't she put on her big girl panties on once in a while an taken a stand.  For that matter, why is Ana so irresponsible with birth control?  That's just beyond irritating.  Icould have taken this poorly written crap if there had been some character growth--if our esteemed author hadn't glorified abuse but alas it saddens me that this garbage was published while better writers languish.

B00EMGUT1I|5.0|Fantastic display of Motorhead's unique blend of rock & roll, punk, metal and blues.<br /><br />A couple of slower numbers (Lost Woman Blues is fantastic) surrounded by classic sounding Motorhead meat.  For those who prefer Motorhead's heavier and faster ditties there is much to like; End of Time, Going to Mexico, Queen of the Damned and Paralyzer are sure to please.<br /><br />Many \\"mid tempo\\" (by Motorhead standards) songs are there: Do You Believe, Death Machine, Silence When You Speak to Me and Crying Shame. All good, not filler.<br /><br />If you're a fan, buying Aftershock is a no-brainer.  If you're not a fan... what is your problem?!
0071390111|5.0|Kandel et al. cover just about every aspect of neural science one can imagine. The book is very well organized and indexed. Explanations are very clear and rigorously technical, and most topics are accompanied by very high-quality illustrations. There are occasional typographical errors, but in a book this large, that is hard to avoid. Heck, the thing must weigh over twenty pounds! I find this book an indispensable reference when I need to write a paper on a topic in neuroscience.
0399226907|5.0|We all know and love this classic book. Of course we want to read it to our wee ones. But if you're going to be reading it to a baby still going through the &#34;Super Interactive Reading&#34; phase that involves smacking the book, please do yourself a favor and get the board book. At some point your lovely hardcover (or worse, paperback) will get ripped and that will be sad. No concerns with the board book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Flynn is insightful, witty, brilliant. She creates characters so flawed, but also so complex.<br />All three of her books number among my favorites of all time.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game keeps you on your toes. Tho this is a match game you do specific challenges to achieve the next level and try not to use up all you lives doing so. For if you do there is a so called time out til you can get more. Or you have the option of purchasing more etc. I had never played this game and in no time was I hooked.  THIS A GREAT GAME THAT YOU'LL NEVER GET BORED WITH, GET IT AND ENJOY.

1476727651|5.0|What ever happened to Danny Torrance.  Those of us who loved &#34;THE SHINING&#34; have wondered that for years.  Well he is all grown up now and dealing with his &#34;shine&#34; in different ways, some destructive for awhile. His special gift is helping people to &#34;cross over.&#34;  when as young girl who is strong in the shine contacts him he is pulled into a deathly fight to save her from a group of not so human beings called The True Knot.  While not as scary as THE SHINING, this sequel is more mature and just as exciting. If you didn't read THE SHINING  or see the movie, not the Jack Nicholson one, the other one, you will still enjoy this but it is even better for those who read the original book.
B004478AS4|4.0|Great novel by a wonderful writer many years ago. Easy to follow and keeps you pulled right into the story
030758836X|2.0|I wonder if there is a book discussion group in this country that didn't choose this book at some point. And I can't help but think that its sales figures would be substantially lower if we hadn't all been force-fed this book based on the hype. I thought it strained credibility to the extreme, the characters were completely unlikeable (and not just the obvious ones), and the ending was a complete let-down. Wish I had read more of the negative reviews, and maybe skipped that book group meeting.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that kindle finally got this game.  Everyone has been playing this game for a while.  This is a challenging game, it keeps you interested in the game, by trying to get to the next level.  I would recommend this game for those who like challenges.  You only get 5 lives to complete the level, if you do not complete the level you either wait for time to build up more lives or pay to get more lives.  I wait because, I am patient and cheap.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was so looking forward to this book! I had such high hopes! I loved the first two in the series, and could not wait to read this,I kind of wish I wouldn't have now. I know that everyone is upset over the ending, but honestly that is not the only thing that bothered me in this book. I found the two different POV confusing, although I loved hearing more from Tobias perspective, sometimes I felt like they sounded like the same person. Also, it seemed very monotonous ( ie. tris and Tobias have a fight, another attack happens, they make up, then start to plan another revolution, are we on revolution 5 or 6 now? I can't remember) it just didn't flow for me. I know distopian  YA  books are usually packed with a lot of action, and I get that, but at the same time it just feels a little redundant, and predictable.<br />Ok now about the ending, I'm not someone who believes that every story needs a happy ending, on the contrary ( I loved The Fault In our Stars by John Green and that has a very sad ending) however I do feel that an ending should at the very least not feel so contrived. I felt like it was totally predictable, I read it before i read any of the spoilers and by the time I got to the scene with Caleb, and everyone feels like he should be the sacrifice, it was obvious Tris would in the end never sacrifice her brother, I just didn't buy it. It was too predictable. If you want to take your protagonist out at the end, fine, but shouldn't it at least make a little bit of sense?she finally wanted to live, she finally understood what love was, and what was worth fighting for. It just didn't work for me.<br />I did enjoy seeing Tris and Tobias relationship grow and how they dealt with that, also the friendship between christina and Tobias was very sweet, the Uriah death just seemed to come out of nowhere and I honestly feel like it didn't serve any purpose except to of course serve as a catalyst for tris and Tobias to fight(again) and to play on the Emotional guilt Tobias felt, I mean hasn't the guy been through enough?<br />I also felt that there were  some underdeveloped characters in this. Are we really supposed to believe that Evelyn would just drop her whole fight for control over the city from one conversation with her son? The gesture was sweet, but we never saw one redeeming quality of hers that would suggest that she even had a softer side. Aside from her looking at the blue glass that she gave to Tobias. It just all seemed (again) to convenient. I respect veronica Roth as a writer, I generally like her writing style and the stories in the first two books really seemed to flow nicely, but I feel like she really missed the mark on this one.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|If you are an introvert or think you may be this is the book you need to read.  I was recommended this book by several like minded people.  Its easy to read and flows really well.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|While the third Iron Man movie wasn't an atrocious one like Spider-Man 3 it was the weakest in storyline plot sadly though I still enjoyed the movie overall it that's what pretty much counts for movie viewers.  The action and effects are top notch and I'm glad to see the cast for the most part stayed for the entire trilogy and while this won't be the end of live action Iron Man seeing as Avengers 2 is being prepared it's still a little depressing that this part of the franchise is over.<br /><br />One person has asked if it's worth getting this set instead of the single disc standard dvd one and on that question I say it is worth getting as you get the higher video quality blu-ray disc as well as the still very good video quality dvd disc and digital copy as well. So if you still haven't gotten a blu-ray player no worries as you do get the regular dvd until you finally decide to.  So if you've already seen the previous two movies this is a must have addition to your collection just keep the expectation of the story to match up in quality to the previous two movies otherwise expect some disappointment.

B000OSC3GM|4.0|I have seen this one a couple of times. As entertainment, it has something going for it. Not many movies where the US military decides to stage a military coup.<br /><br />I never really believed the basic premise that a \\"liberal\\" US president could just arbitrarily decide to dismantle the US nuclear arsenal through a treaty with the Soviets. That would have to get past a 1960s era Senate and the chances of that happening were nil, even if the Soviets had been willing to go along.<br /><br />The basic premise seemed to be that the chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff (played by Burt Lancaster) does not trust the Soviets to abide by the terms of the treaty, something that seems like a very reasonable fear to have. So he plots a coup against the president.<br /><br />There is some nonsense about a secret unit the general manages to create that is planning to take over the airwaves to broadcast the general's political views once he takes over, and some kind of broadcaster who is planning to help him.<br /><br />The whole problem with this is that a coup is about being able to apply sufficient force under your own control to be able to take over. The movie never made me believe that the general was going to be able to make it stick.<br /><br />OTOH, it was an interesting premise and the movie made the most of a premise that is at best a stretch.<br /><br />Kirk Douglas plays a USMC colonel who is an aid to the general. He is pretty straitlaced and really too good to be true as he finds clues to the plot and tries to help squash it.<br /><br />Ava Gardner plays a former mistress of the general. She seemed too old to me to be a credible mistress. There is an almost bizarre scene where Kirk Douglas tries to romance her character in an effort to get dirt on the general that was almost funny to me because it was so far out of character for the colonel.<br /><br />In the end, the US is saved by what amounts to almost random chance. That ended up being rather unsatisfying tome.<br /><br />At one point the president and the general are talking in the white house and the president demands he resign. At this point I am thinking - you are the president - just fire the guy and announce it and the whole thing is over.

No really scary monsters so Ok for all ages.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Very satisfting read with lovable heros and really nasty bad guys.  One of the best endings since Firestarter.  Fun book.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|Good story. Well written, great characters, and a great cameo (no spoiler alert). Keep up the great stories Joe, and I will keep buying them and hopefully keep you in a lifestyle you are fast becoming accustomed to. That of a great author.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I chose this rating because of the show itself, I love the entertainment it brings, and it brings my family together with laughter night. Can't wait til the next season is available to purchase.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|The case is nice and handy, provides good protection for the set. A really nice feature is that the case has a built in battery which will charge the ear piece a number of times before it needs recharging.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|It's like the handheld RPGs you were addicted to as a kid, but better, funnier, and with a bigger world. My only complaint is how long it takes to travel places. Seriously though, it's a fantastic game and more than worth the money.

0007466706|5.0|I loved the second book.  I still have not decided how I want the third book to end.  Which is unusal for me because I always pick a favorite and stick with it from the get go.  But she has built both of her suitors up so well.  I find myself rooting for one man one chapter and the next chapter I'm rooting for the other.  This one was a bit more built up then the first book which was entertaining and I can't wait until next year when the third book comes out.  I will be reading the first two books again before the final book comes out.  Kiera Cass has me so excited for the third book!!!  Well done Kiera!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book.  The writing is so graceful and the characters fill you up and make your heart want to explode.  At least for me, haha.

Also, when my son was a teenager in the '80's it became his favorite album of all times.The only mistake I made in buying the DVD is I didn't buy the original one.It still is great but, I would of enjoyed the original better but, that was my mistake.
B003B02O0U|5.0|Talk about all the right ingredients to make a classic American thriller - this is it!  Couldn't put it down for the last half.  Beautifully developed, great characters and the plot - beyond the beyond.  Very highly recommended to get addicted to Gresham.

B009AMANH4|5.0|I bought this DVD because the film sounded so interesting & it got great reviews. They were right. It was fantastic.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Very scary movie jumps come a dime a dozen. The story based on a true event always helps to hold your interest longer when deep in your mind you think that this REALLY HAPPENED will make you shutter. Acting was excellent, the total atmosphere of dread clung close. The only thing that kept it from being a 5 star rating was that it didn't have enough of the brutal battle between the demon and the exorcist. Expecting an R rating extravaganza  you will be let down but hey rent this movie without hesitation!!!!!
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|Not a bad movie, but definitely not for children.  Lots of images of weapons and shooting anything from medieval devices to bombs.  In fact, the only children in the movie sleep in bombshells.  Plus, much of the film shows adults mistreating children.  It's true, by the end of the film the adults have a change of heart, but you have to endure some dark adult behaviour before you get there.  Maybe ok for a junior high kid.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The controversy of this movie is...confusing. Everybody is complaining that the movie is nothing like the book, however the movie, well and truly, was not just of the Hobbit. Tolkien had many other stories of middle earth and Jackson built off of this and others. The movie is not a perfect adaptation of the book, but then that will never be the case. Most all major movie series are based off of books, and none of them have followed the book exactly. To say that this one is horrible because it doesn't follow the books correctly is like saying that cats are horrible because they aren't exactly like there ferocious ancestors. The movie itself is exciting, has wonderful acting, and is done beautifully. There is no reason not to enjoy the adaptation which has been provided for us.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|The final book in the Divergent series was entertaining while I was reading it - though not as edge-of-my-seat as previous installments - and while I could still hope the author might turn it around. After finishing, I disappointed but hopeful the films might actually improve on it.<br /><br />There were several major problems, but I think all reflect a lack of continuity with the previous books. The first two were dramatic and powerful, and this one was...not. I agree with another critic who suggested that the author really had no idea what to write after the end of Insurgent.<br /><br />1. Narrative structure and tone: I am open to alternative narrative structures, including the two-narrator style the author chose, but I generally like a trilogy to be consistent, and the sudden inclusion of Tobias as a narrator seemed odd. More problematically, although I like the author's writing style in general, there was very little difference in tone between the two sections. I often missed the change in narrator for a page or so, until something seemed off, and then had to flip back to the start of the chapter to recheck.<br /><br />2. The major plotline: It moves along quickly enough, and I felt like each scene was well-written and had merit. But taken all together, it was unsatisfying. Although yes, of course, authors can do whatever they want with their stories. But jettisoning the idea that the residents had to leave the city to help save the world outside? I think the story that the author prompted readers to start envisioning at the end of the second book would have been much more rewarding to read, and I agree with other critics who have said it feels like a last-minute change in direction because the author didn't really know what to write after the second book.<br /><br />3. The science behind the plot: So admittedly, I'm a doctor who does medical research. I know quite a bit about genetics and experimentation. But I'm also a sci-fi fan who is generally willing to give authors a lot of leeway, and a YA fan as well (introduced to this series by a patient). Still, the back story was never fully fleshed out, or even logical, even within the context of the world the author has created. If the basic premise was that altering genes to take away an undesirable trait (like aggression) took away positive traits as well (like motivation), then why set up the social experiment/behavior modification component? Wouldn't that just reinforce the genetic problem by perpetuating the same unbalanced behavior? Also what made people think genes would \\"heal\\" themselves over time? (A small population of mostly \\"damaged\\" people would create a pretty strong founder effect.) I needed the characters to answer more of these questions (and questions about the Purity War, etc.) for themselves by the end of the story (Caleb and Cara sometimes seem written just to serve that purpose). And while I really, really liked the idea of Tobias facing and coming to terms with his history, his lack of Divergence just seemed like a device to create conflict. (Plus, if Divergence is not a dominant trait once acquired - which seems to be the case since Caleb and Tobias both have Divergent parents but are not themselves - it seems like the experiment will fail. Basically, I just needed the author to have brushed on basic genetics a little more before writing her story.)<br /><br />4. The ending: I read dark and depressing works of fiction on a regular basis. I don't at all object to a character, even the protagonist, receiving a well-earned, heroic or otherwise emotionally satisfying death that furthers the story and completes the character's development. If you kill your protagonist, it MUST be the necessary final step in the character's development. Otherwise (again to echo another reviewer), it is purely for shock value. These requirements were absolutely not met. First of all, throughout the story, the author has been fairly cavalier about killing off main characters- too cavalier, in that, although, yes, people die in war, it diminishes the impact for the reader. (For instance, killing Tori was pointless - there was already so much grief in the books, and the reader's empathy is pretty well absorbed with grief for Tris' parents, her betrayal by her brother, Tobias' abuse and abandonment, and Will, with some left over for Lynn and Marlene. Tori's reunion with her brother would have made more of an emotional statement than her death just before.)<br /><br />Secondly, Tris' character development wasn't furthered by her death at all. She was already brave, selfless and more than willing to die for those she loved (although in terms of skill sets, it definitely made more sense for her to go than Caleb). It probably would have reflected more character development if she had let someone else make the sacrifice. It also made no sense that she would be able to resist the death serum by sheer will to live and then accept her death after being shot. What? It also didn't fit the character development for David that the author seemed to be starting. I love Tris' mother's backstory - that was awesome - and she repeatedly had Tris feel some empathy for David, as well as showing that David was drawn to Tris because of his relationship with her mother. After that build-up, it made sense for David and Tris to have a confrontation but not for David to shoot her. (I actually would have found Evelyn's refusal to be moved by her son's pleas more convincing in light of the story the author wrote up until that point.)<br /><br />Third, the story wasn't furthered by her death - perhaps, in part because the ending was so anticlimactic. Tobias moped for awhile and started to mend, and the city was no longer at war but the world wasn't radically changed - which it needed to be, given the emphasis throughout Allegiant on how tiny Chicago actually is in the scheme of things.<br /><br />All in all, this didn't feel like the same series that I loved and re-read countless times previously. A major disappointment!- too cavalier, in that, although, yes, people die in war, it diminishes the impact for the reader. (For instance, killing Tori was pointless - there was already so much grief in the books, and the reader's empathy is pretty well absorbed with grief for Tris' parents, her betrayal by her brother, Tobias' abuse and abandonment, and Will, with some left over for Lynn and Marlene.

I recommend it to everyone who hasn't experienced this to remind them as well of the magic of Christmas.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Allegiant, which concludes the Divergent trilogy, has taught me several things:<br />do NOT pre-order a book in a series ever again;<br />always read the ending first - that way you don't get emotionally invested in characters who will be killed off;<br />refuse to ride the emotional roller coaster - read books by authors you can trust with your feelings;<br />if you want to read a REALLY GOOD tragedy there's always &#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34;;<br />and don't keep falling for the hype.<br />I'm just sorry it's taken me so long to learn.
B0093LINVK|5.0|I installed this unit with a 120GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM running Windows 8.1.<br />Results have been very good in my setup. It runs Windows 8.1 with ease. It's fast, boots quickly and handles most tasks. I use it mostly for XBMC but I've also used it to rip Blu-rays and CDs, play light games, capture video and other general tasks. I think as long as you don't try to play high-end games or run graphics intensive applications this computer works very well.<br />It is especially suited as an HTPC as it runs very quiet, it's small and it handles HD video and audio very well. It's not a cheap solution but performance is good enough to make it worth it for me.
0385528787|1.0|Although I agree with readers that the first two books in the trilogy were wonderful, this last book I had to force myself to read. It should be titled \\"Zebulon's Story.\\" The main characters in the story actually change: Strong Amanda becomes weak and is all but written out of the story; Self-motivated Toby is whiny and clingy; Jimmy is only in the background; and those that surrounded Glenn \\"Crake\\" that survived the waterless flood are shallow and silly. The only character that stays true is Zeb. And the entire book is about him. And it goes nowhere.<br /><br />What is the book even about? I don't know. So much of the book was just \\"filler\\" and could have easily been edited out, but then the story would have been so much shorter. Additionally, despite the first few pages summarizing the preceding books, there is so much reference to the first books, that it becomes repetitive. It just seemed that Margret Atwood did not know where to take the story, so she just started writing and went off on a tangent. I cannot explain how disappointing this book was--especially when I was so looking forward to reading it. I even re-read the first two books before I began this one.<br /><br />I am so absolutely disappointed with this book.

With that said, I still enjoyed the book highly. He has a different way of connecting with the reader through a dialogue of himself and another, posing questions and having them answered. It is almost like peeking in on what his music lessons might have been like, seeing the communication between teacher and student.<br />Even as a performer of over 20 years at the harp, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone wanting a fresh perspective on music, whether they are a beginner student or well-seasoned.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|There are not many movies you can watch without a lot of talking. But this one does it. It is a great fun movie about what our future could be like if we let Robots run the place. I have a 3 year old, and we loved watching this together.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Awesome<br /> masterpiece!  I could not stop reading it! A GREAT WORK OF ART !! Should be the number one best seller---must read!
B0034G4OXQ|1.0|The movie itself was in great shape and had nothing to do with the condition of the movie. The movie highlights are great but the plot line is not worth the viewing in my opinion.

0451419243|4.0|I enjoyed the 1st book of this trilogy so much that I could barely wait the week between putting down the first book and getting my hands on the second one! This book picks up from 1933 through to 1953. The connections between the families from England, Germany, Russia and the USA, which had been established in the first book, become more closely interwoven in this second book.<br /><br />As in the first book the historical background is well researched and the key characters continue to play a pivotal role in the lead up to the Second World War, the war itself, and the new order being established after the war.<br /><br />This book did not quite create the emotional sadness over the tragedy of the First World War I felt reading the first book . However, its portrayal of the rise of fascism during the 1930s, and the abuse of power by the fascists throughout that period and the Second World War, is quite superb. Some of the sections dealing with this, and the behaviour of the Russians in Berlin towards the end of the war, hold little back in the presentation of the horror of what happened.<br /><br />My rating of 4 stars, compared to 5 stars for the first book, purely reflects my personal interest in the Edwardian period compared to the mid 20th century, combined with a sense that I felt I knew most of the characters in the second book and their actions rarely surprised me. That said, another superb book by the author, leaving me with a sense of high expectation that the third part of this trilogy will cover the fascinating political period of the Cold War.
