B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a great book. It's full of life and love and the truth of feelings. I would recommend it to anyone.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Was on Son's gift list.  He seemed very happy with it he missed some of the origional episodes and said he will enjoy watching it from beginnin to end.
B001GA1RFA|3.0|Honestly, I expected more after read The Fault in our Stars but it was still cute and funny. Worth reading (:
B008QTVNUI|4.0|We're only 5 episodes in and we're addicted. A great way to fill the winter break. You'll have a hard time watching just one in a sitting.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Bought this as a gift for a Yankee swap and there wasn't any complaints just some battling over it. All three new batman movies in one set for a good price... Awesome!
B0091WQ58E|5.0|I love this movie! It definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. Plus it has great humor! I can't wait for the sequel.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|This is a really awesome app if you're a ninja kiwi lover, but some people, even me, do not fully understand this game.  Once you really play this game, you'll get the hang of it.  And people who didn't find it downloading you just did it wrong.  It's just like every app.  Some people downloaded it wrong.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Surprise after surprise with every page....  Pendergast at his best.  Loved it.  One of the best ones in the series.  More please!!!
B0094KT8PK|5.0|I love this movie. Betty White is awesome. It's definitely a feel-good movie! It's one of Sandra Bullock's best movies.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|It was a great book I couldn't put it down. It had action adventure and everything else in between. Awesome
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Great game but always be wary of cash shops. This game definitely has a tempting one. Lovely all around, though. Fantastic for fans young and old of the show.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|This movie is horrible! Matthew McConnaughay can do so much better. It was like let's take some good bodies and just make a stupid movie!
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Great graphics and addictive game play. I am a big fan! Worth the price, with a lot of replay value.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have to agree with other reviews about this book. I too am a huge DeMille fan, but found this lastest book to be a big disappointment. I loved John Corey in all his past books but something changed about the character in this one. His usually quick witt became quickly annoying.  The book was a big let down as a sequel to the LION.....
B005UA0FLE|5.0|I love this singer he is one of my all time favorites and I really think this is one of his best Christmas collection loved all the songs don't wait it is very good and the price was great !!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I enjoyed the movie very much!  I thought the pace was a bit slow at the end.  I never saw the TV series so I could not compare the movie to the TV series.
0843198761|5.0|We have been collecting Mr. Men books since the 1970's for my eldest son, before they came to USA. I have read them to my three sons over the years and am now reading them to my two grandsons.  The illustrations are colorful and most appealing to younger ones, the stories are great 'lessons' for little ones to grasp and the size of the books are perfect for little hands to hold.  Thirty plus years later I am still collecting!  Yes, I most definitely recommend these books.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|My 2 year old son LOVES this truck! He's been taking it to bed with him every night since Christmas when he got it. Its easy for his little hands to manipulate and move. Its also very durable and standing up against my rough boy! I will be getting him another Bruder truck for his birthday!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It left me speechless with tears in my eyes. Perfection. I will be rereading and rereading this trilogy for years.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is effective, quick and fun. You definitely feel it right away. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a jump start to working out. Who doesn't have 20 minutes to spare?
B006M4F67A|4.0|Love the app but can't save game and tiles too small & not enlargeable? Very easy to operate otherwise.  The light colors make it easier on the eyes.  Would like a few more game options (size, game save, and a bit more explanation of what control symbols mean).
B006LS7DQE|5.0|Initially had difficulty figuring out how it all worked as I had always played &#34;straight&#34; match 3 games, but once I got the hang of it I was addicted!  Although I've only had it a few days I think it's a great time to give one's brain something to do and pass time. The game seems to have endless opportunities for play given the different character options and was much more than I expected.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is a great read! I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to see the movie in February
B007SY3CEW|2.0|This app is very fun and you can really learn to play these songs. A number of them I already know but failed at grade-wise because it requires you to play three notes chords but the kindle can only pick up on two touches at once so you will always fail at any song with 3+ notes in a chord. There is also a complete lack of free playing piano which is a shame because this is one of the more comfortable keyboards to play from most others have keys either too small or too big.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I love Marvel based movies, and this one was as i expected .... Awesome! I'll buy it soon, and watch it over and over.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|This movie is very good.  The plot of the movie doesn't come out until almost the end of the movie, but its worth watching and Miley Cyrus does a wonderful job acting.  Great choice in selection of a movie.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Thanks KISS for a wonderful album.  Well worth the wait for this MONSTER! It's got all it needs.  ROCK & ROLL!  nuff said :-)
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Best game ever I just downloaded this and it is awesome<br />I just finished level 6 and before that bought the axe after the training one
B006LSZECO|3.0|Interesting read, but it just ends. I hate that!  Great premise, but somehow disjointed.<br />Would have loved a wrap-up chapter.<br />.
B002ZG98FU|3.0|Morning Glory has a likable cast, and some funny moments, but overall it's a comedy that falls flat. Rachel McAdams, as always, is cute and enjoyable but can't quite carry this uneven story. Harrison Ford is at his grumpiest here, which adds to the comedic tone. There are a few cast members I would have liked to see on screen more, including Diane Keaton and especially Jeff Goldblum. Besides the interactions between the two leads, there aren't many laughs to be had.
B00422LESO|5.0|What if we could go back in time, even for two weeks, to re-live an era far more romantic than our own. Hale hits a home run with this funny, sad, well-researched and tightly woven novel.
1616614609|4.0|Great cyberpunk themed card game that includes asymmetrical gameplay between two players that play the \\"Corporation\\" and the \\"Runner\\".    Complexity in mechanics and card abilities adds several layers of advanced strategy and critical thinking.    I liked this game so much that my friend and I had to create a comprehensive video tutorial ([..]) about this card game. Hope it helps you make a decision on whether you want this game or not.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|WE LIKE THIS GAME. IT requires you to think and strategize. I LIKE THE HUMOR ALSO. THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF CREATIVITY.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|what more can I say? Note, sync, search; fully cross platform; does what it says on the box and more. Good work.
B005LAIH54|5.0|I chose to give this movie five stars because it is better than the first part &#34;Clash of the Titans&#34;. I showed it to my students and gave them a few comprehension questions so they could answer them.<br />Love the movie. IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool..<br /><br />BUY IT!<br /><br />Seriously, this is perhaps the single most awesome piece of PA or TEOTWAWKI reading I may have ever indulged in, and one of the VERY few I would consider to be Literature.<br /><br />Frankly, you do not even need to be remotely interested in the genre to be absorbed by this story and find yourself cheering and crying, ranting and raving, and just holding on for the ride.<br /><br />You will find yourself thinking about the story, and it's characters, for hours after you have put it down.<br /><br />Why am I still typing?<br /><br />Wool.  BUY IT.<br /><br />Better yet, if they offer it in old-tech paper, but it that way so you can never not be able to read it again whenever you wish...<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />It's THAT good.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|It was hard to put this book down, I loved the plot and the pace of the book, it's exceptionally well written.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|Love the action in the movie. Hope they come out with another one. They should make two more! Seeing parts of the real footage of the landing on the moon was great.
B007IE4DSG|4.0|George really has some great songs like &#34;Run of the Mill&#34;, which people overlook. His guitar playing really shines and is enjoyable. It's nice to hear him play acoutic without the slide guitar! A gem of an c.D. Go buy one!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its super fun. I have a lot of fun playing this. I just keep trying to get more coins. I want more coins and prizes
B006YFR7H4|3.0|WAITING FOR THE SUN might be evidence that Jim Morrison was either a tapped-out lyric writer (\\"Not To Touch The Earth\\" and \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\") or just totally stoned out of his mind (\\"The Celebration Of The Lizard\\" poetry). But then, we see flashes of the sort of brilliance that permeated the DOORS' first two albums-- tracks like \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" and \\"Five To One\\" stand up against any that this band ever recorded.<br /><br />Musically, WAITING FOR THE SUN often sounds tremendously dated-- perhaps it was outmoded even in 1968. Fuzz guitar and calliope-like organ are everywhere-- there's waltzes (\\"Wintertime Love\\") and schmaltzes (\\"Love Street\\") and all sorts of filler. A pattern of inconsistency established here followed the group right through to L.A. WOMAN. The DOORS were a band that the \\"Best Of\\" compilation was ideal for. Like [[ASIN:B000M4PPM2 THE SOFT PARADE]] and [[ASIN:B000K380NG MORRISON HOTEL]], WAITING FOR THE SUN is only for their most devoted fans and perhaps '60s rock completists.<br /><br />SIDE ONE:<br />[2:14] Hello, I Love You<br />[2:53] Love Street<br />[3:56] Not to Touch the Earth<br />[3:22] Summer's Almost Gone<br />[1:54] Wintertime Love<br />[3:25] The Unknown Soldier<br /><br />SIDE TWO:<br />[3:03] Spanish Caravan<br />[3:01] My Wild Love<br />[2:26] We Could Be So Good Together<br />[2:36] Yes, the River Knows<br />[4:26] Five to One<br /><br />TOTAL TIME: 33:08
B0032KPE0G|5.0|Great movie--great cast.  Highly recommend for a light, fun movie.  Nothing earth shattering:  just nice to watch and enjoy it
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|It was pretty funny, id watch it again. I paid $1.99 to rent it and it was worth it :) deffinatily not for kids!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Really fun game.  I get done with one level and I have to play the next. I can't put it down, I keep telling myself I'll only play one more level.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|This works as it should and is pretty right now for the amounts. I wish it displayed in the status bar at the top so I did not have to keep opening the app. Just total battery life in percentage would be nice.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Season three is great fun.  Lots of good episodes and character development.  I would say season three builds nicely from the previous two seasons.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Standard Blu-ray disc, I did like the movie and the contrast is great on blu-ray compared to how I originally saw it on DVD.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A must have app for your Kindle fire and better than some of the pay apps. I find the percentage option to be an indispensable feature.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This video game is fun..but its hard to maneuver. But i still find it fun..not for a hardcore fan they will get frustrated.
B002DEI4NG|4.0|This is a great series that we're catching up on.  Where were we?  The only disappointment we have is that the video resolution is mediocre at best on an HDTV.
B009VB97EY|2.0|This story line was just so horrible, and the leading actress so incredibly awful, that even my boy Matthew McConauhey could not save the day.  There are so many more interesting plot line options they could have used in this movie.  Channing is such a cutie though.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is the best!  I was using my phone calculator, but this is much easier.  I use it a lot, especially to balance my. check book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|As a writer of a children's book, and the mother of a special child, I highly recommend this book to anyone who was ever a child or a parent.
B002GHIPYI|4.0|these things are huge but i love them they look nice though the gears in the outside look nice the headphones themselves look nice.  the bad parts are that i have no idea how to adjust them consistently i have been able to adjust them but its more accidental than anything also positive/ negative the cord is pretty long maybe about 5 feet or so it's good sometimes and its sturdy but other times it cumbersome but overall they are great headphones
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Enjoyed every minute. Being a woman in my late twenties, this book is s great reminder of timeless lessons on love, f as July and relationships.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|The head really has to be forced to move and the construction of the body is a cheap plastic. The design is fine, but the material is cheap.<br /><br />The UV writing is pretty cool, though.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|makes you want play all night. I would recommend for any age and I am 70. I just don't. think you should be charged for extra coins.  Wow having played this several days I am really pumped. Grrrrrrrr8,<br />You don't have to be old to play this, it keeps you hungry to earn more coins.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book...I can't wait to start the second! Keeps you fixated and flipping through till the end. The book was greatly written that speaks directly to the audience.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|The DVD, &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; is fantastic, I watch it at least 3 times a week during the time between Thanksgiving and Christmas every year, it never gets old, I bought this one this for a friend for Christmas as she only had a copy which she recorded off of the TV about 10 years ago, she was absolutely thrilled.<br />W
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book was well written, but it was tiresome to read about so many characters that had no (or few) positive qualities.
B005LAII1C|4.0|I had looked forward to getting this movie when it came out on bluray. Didn't really have the time to see in theaters, but my friends told me it was a very funny movie, and it was definitely worth seeing.<br /><br />At first glance when I first saw the ads on TV, I thought it looked kind of stupid, despite liking Seth and his shows, but after hearing about it, I decided it might be worth a viewing.<br /><br />Got it for my mom for Christmas, seeing as she likes Family Guy, and we watched it together. We watched the theatrical version, seeing as I didn't think my mother would enjoy the unrated version, and overall, we both thought it was pretty good.<br /><br />It was more profane, but not as crude, as we expected it to be. The laughs were certainly there, but it wasn't nearly as funny as I had it described to me. I had it described to me as one of the funniest movies my friends had seen, and while I thought it was funny enough, it didn't think it was that much funnier than the average, run of the mill comedy that seems to come out every week. What I wasn't expecting was that it would be as \\"deep\\" as it was. I thought it would be pretty shallow on plot, but I have to say, it wasn't bad.<br /><br />I'd like to see Seth have his hand at another movie (Family Guy movie, **hint** **hint**), but it certainly wasn't bad.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app is great. it works very well. the only thing i haven't used is multiplayer but the single player works fine.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|This book did not keep my attention at times, but I kept coming back to it and was glad that I finished it because the story had a positive ending.  The main character was interesting.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|In my opinion its a good app,there's<br /> lots of variety and the name says it all! I recommend it. It's free as well so why not give it try?
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The DVD was in great condition. worked very well. Great movie with good message. I'm very pleased with this buy.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|The book is enticing if you watched the movie first. Then when you actually read it the book is 20 times better than the movie. Kudos to Nicholas Sparks!
0062200909|5.0|My artsy granddaughter was very pleased with the preliminary artwork displayed throughout the book, and looks forward to building on the sketches to make them her own.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this solitaire app is a lot of fun. I enjoy winning so the selection of \\"winning game\\" completes my happiness.
B009OXS8RQ|4.0|It's just an amazing quality, it does even have a lyrics page, the only problem it's that it didn't came with MP3 Download.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the series and just loved the story! so much so I am reading them again. The characters are wonderful and the story continues into the three books wonderfully!
B005OT2YVA|1.0|It was painful to watch. I was tempted to give it two stars - I love his parents in this movie - until Sam and his girlfriend hopped into the company car after finding out her boss worked for the deceptions. It was just bad.
B002B554TO|5.0|It's not just a good album, but a good vinyl!, it's amazing for it to come with the mp3 download.
B0018LX9T4|2.0|one of the stupidest moves I ever wasted my money on.  Althought I know there are truly some really sick people out there.  I wouldn't recomend this movie to anyone...but to each his own.
B004MWI2M0|5.0|My son was thrilled with this gift for christmas.  My only complaint was that the box was a bit damaged in shipping and with Lego's the box does count for future resale value.  The item however, was in excellent condition and he loved it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|relaxing game. I really like the un do feature. you can get creative and up load a pic from your tablet for the cards background
B007PFD90G|4.0|I began the book rather reluctantly.  All these years I regarded the author as more trouble than he was worth, especially given the denser, more convoluted but ultimately powerful nature of his language and stories.  His memoir has drawn me in as I began to see where he came from and what he was all about. His is a voice I can more readily understand today in my middle age than perhaps in my younger days.
0143119680|1.0|I received this book as a gift, so some masochistically guilt-ridden part of me felt it necessary to keep pushing through chapter after chapter rather than acknowledge the insult to my gift-giver's tastes that came with recognizing just how awful a book this really was.  Thoughts that came to mind while reading included such gems as \\"Does his preference in pens really forward your plot?\\", \\"Yes, you mentioned her nervousness two paragraphs ago, but as I am reading this aloud to my goldfish, I'm sure he appreciated the reminder,\\" and of course, \\"I GET WHAT HE SMELLS LIKE ALREADY.\\"<br /><br />I kept waiting for things to happen, but they didn't.  I hereby drive a stake through the heart of that guilt-whispering imp upon my shoulder and push this book to the back of my shelf, where it can serve perhaps its sole function of taking up just a little more space.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|We loved this movie! We bought it to add to our Christmas movie arsenal, and we are glad we did.
B005LAJ212|5.0|loved it.  received quickly and promptly.  exactly what i ordered.  my husband was able to catch up on last season so he could watch this season with me.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it! This story is funny and quirky. It's a great book. I would definitely read it again. Lol. :)
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Awesome movie. I watch it over and over and I still root for him every time I see it. I love this movie, but I wouldn't have young kids watch it.
B009A9SULS|4.0|I bought this at BB before Christmas when the white mini was on sale for $49. I can say I would not pay $79 for it but at $49 it is a fair price. I like the size and lightweightness of it. I do not have the problems of ghosting etc that others are mentioning. Mine works fine. I did turn off the awards etc because I found them to be annoying and i really do not care about them. By turning off them I did find the download speed to be improved. While it has a slower processor and runs a bit slower than an average e-reader, it is acceptable for what you are using it for. One thing that I don't care for is the darkness of the screen. It might be lighter out in the direct sun but since we have had mostly gray days, I have only used it in the house with a light on.  Even with a ereader light or the nightstand lamp, I still find the screen darker than I personally care for.  Maybe I am just spoiled by the e-ink screens that Amazon uses which are a lighter gray background. The size of the screen is okay for reading the text is clear and easy to read.<br /><br />While I don't intend to use it daily, the size of it makes it nice to slip in a pocket to carry with you when you don't want to carry a larger heavy reader/tablet or will be in a place that you really don't want to have a larger device visible. I don't think it will be high on the list of most stolen devices which makes it nice to carry.  Having had almost all of the kindles since the first one and several other \\"toys\\", this is more of a novelty reader for me. One advantage of having an ipad, etc is you can download the Kobo reader app and load your books onto another device for reading. You do have to watch the price of the books and the Kobo library doesn't have a large selection but I have found some cheap reads to justify getting this little thing.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|this is the stupidest book ever and I will never look at this again in my life. Make my day!!!!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its a good game.  similar to many others just with a different theme. for the money you really cant beat it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Really enjoyed this one, hadn't read one of his in a while and didn't want to put it down-Great Read
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very well written. It had my attention from the very first sentence.  I never wanted to put it down and was anxious to be able to pick it up & start reading again. Can't wait to start reading the next one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I definitely did not get what I expected from this book. Every time I thought I knew what would happen I was wrong and I loved every second. Character development for Katniss is exactly what I might expect from a woman transformed by blood, loss, and love. All the puzzle pieces fit and it made sense. Not once was I reading and thought that something seemed forced by the author simply to push the story along. There is a flow to this book and the whole trilogy making it impossible to put down and more impossible not to fall in love with the rich characters. This is a series I would highly recommend a high school student who might not love reading. My only complaint is that I'm done reading it and am craving more!
B008YP272M|5.0|Intelligent readers who have admired Hitch's polemical and fearless views will approach this 19th month journey- from learning about his inoperable oeophageal cancer to his death- not really knowing what to expect.<br />Rejecting self-pity with the pragmatism with which he accepts his diagnosis as the natural consequence of burning the candle at both ends, he takes the reader through a Dantesque descent into the Inferno which is 'tumourland'.<br />Powerlessness is his newest and deadliest enemy, but other foes rise up and taunt him, especially remarks by self-serving strangers and well- meaning friends: words as torture segues into the nature and evil of torture, so that a crucifix on the bedroom wall of one hospital reminds him of the Inquisition's habit of throwing a crucifix into the face of its victim when in extremis; and the panic-inducing outpouring of secretions into his nose and mouth after prolonged treatment leads him to the subject of waterboarding, an ordeal he experienced so that readers of Vanity Fair could make a just assessment of a practice which he regarded as shameful.<br />It is impossible to read this without a sense of sadness, that any human should endure this level of mental and physical suffering, but especially a man who loved to live, to talk and debate what it means to be human.<br />I felt very, very sorry for him.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games was very good and enticing. I couldn't put it down... now to read the second book whoop whoop!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A book you can't put down. Amazing and heart breaking. Must read! Love love love love love love love love!!
B004OZZ624|5.0|A sit on the edge of your seat movie, thriller from start to end.  Excellent acting with a plot that didn't take the normal thriller movie twists and turns.  You were kept guessing to the last minute.  This is the best thriller I have watched in years.
B0034G4P94|5.0|I love this movie!!! and it helps that both the main characters are handsome; after watching it, it made me want to train in MMA
B001P3SA94|5.0|I chose i love it because this movie did a great job taking us back to the beginning of new record label once again it displayed a great cast
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I'll be honest, I read the first book, liked that it was raw, half way into the second one I stoped because it turned into another, &#34;the guy professes his love, yuppy bull crap.&#34; However, after a month or two I decided to finish it and then at the end of the second... well I HAD to get the third, just to finish the story. The third was good, and even though it was predictable to me, Im glad I finished it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What is there not to like? This woman can really sing! The songs are fun to sing along with also.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|My grandfather watched the orginial star trek, I grew up to those reruns and I often am iffy on remakes, however with Chris Pine, I am more then happy to watch this one and with Thor as his dad in the beginning.
B008AX1HD8|3.0|I have read and enjoyed several of John Nesbo's novels.<br />However, as an Australian, I found this book disappointing. The narrative was constantly interrupted by what seemed to me to be tourist information about Sydney.<br />What a pity.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|My dad is a firm believer that I have to watch all the orginials... This one is more my generation, however after seeing the orginial, thank god for technology.
B0044XV3QY|2.0|What the heck was all the hype over this movie about?<br />What a boring story line. Would not recommend it.
B003WTE886|5.0|I bought this CD as a gift for my sister and she listens to it almost every day. Of course it's up to the listener, but she loves it, and that's enough for me.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|It's very addicting.but very pricy.you made me blow of 20 bucks!lower the prices!in the new update,you should make the game so you can have friends with gamecenter.also,lower the process got gems,good and coins.
B0095R64AO|1.0|We rented this movie because we remembered seeing funny commercials for it when it came out.  Apparently, those were the only funny scenes!  I normally don't leave reviews, but I do read them.  Someone else was right when they said they felt like this movie took five years to watch!  Boring and too long
0439023491|5.0|After reading the Hunger Games I had to have the next book in the series to read, also, so I bought it
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The Winter of the World is an excellent saga. There is enough character development to really be involved with the story. A good sequel.
0439023513|5.0|Once I read the first two books in the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; series, the ending was still clear, so I bought and read the third book, also, to satisfy my curiosity, and it did!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The Racketeer was Boring. Character development was poorer than in most JG's books. I just didn't care what happened to anyone!
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Aside from a few funny lines, the movie sucked big time. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man was hard to put down because it moved so quickly and was so timely. Lots of twists that added to the suspense.
B0047E6LW6|5.0|Reminds me of a combo of Mercyful Fate and Blue Oyster Cult. Sinister lyrics and awesome music for some creepy tunes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This has been a great ending to a wonderful book 3 of the hunger games!  I wish it had been more than three book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Pretty good? Its addicting and challenging and it keeps your mind going? Fun for all ages young and old and it stimulates the mind.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book Is what I've been waiting for all summer long you should read this fantastic, wonderful, hilarious, kids book
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This flash offers considerably more flexibility that the SB-400 (which I still have), and so far has performed flawlessly used in conjunction with the D7000. It also comes with a diffuser (very useful for reducing the harshness of the light). I would highly recommend it.
B004EPZ08O|4.0|This was the BEST after the First one. It seems like the same old story plot with the same outcomes but there are some great twists in this one. BUT BEST OF ALL the end will grab you!
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|The movie was bad enough that I fast forwarded towards the end.<br />This version is based loosely on the original, and in my opinion, the original was MUCH more interesting.<br /><br />Completely un-believable plot and scenarios, over and over and over.<br /><br />I've seen better special effects, graphics, and acting in video games.<br /><br />The original wasn't a masterpiece, but I wouldn't be upset to watch it again.<br /><br />This one?<br />I will fight someone before I'm forced to watch it a second time!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Gave this show a try as something to fill the gap while waiting for Breaking Bad to come back on.  Why didn't I watch this sooner?!  Such a great show!  Bought this first season on DVD at such an amazing sale price and lend it out to friends and family regularly.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Pre-ordered this when it first came out and was so glad I did, didn't find it cheaper anywhere else and it came so fast! And of course it's an awesome movie!
B0012GMVVW|5.0|Great album by the most creative rock artist of all-time. This album is a must have. The only rock artist to equal his past, later in his career.
1440503257|2.0|The sole reason I bought this book was for the recipe for butter beer and it WAS NOT IN HERE. Keep in mind that this is an UNOFFICIAL harry potter cook book!!
B008EZVNFE|5.0|Best new artist of the year.  GREAT voice combined with well written songs. BUY IT !!!!!!!! In a sane world, she should be a huge star.
B001TODCII|5.0|My boyfriend kept bothering me that I needed to see this movie, so I caved in and bought it. Awesome, action packed, and suspenseful, I recommend it.
B000002J03|5.0|I can't add anything more to the superlatives that have been used to describe this great album.  So instead, I'll use this opportunity to point out that 3 of these songs were credited to members of Led Zeppelin when they were actually written by other performers.<br /><br />\\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is clearly a cover of Muddy Waters' \\"You Need Love\\" from 1962; \\"The Lemon Song\\" is clearly Howlin' Wolf's \\"Killing Floor\\" originally done by Wolf in 1964 (also covered by Jimi Hendrix, who at least gave Howlin' Wolf credit); and \\"Bring It On Home\\" is very clearly the song by the same name done by Sonny Boy Williamson in 1963.  For those who don't know, there were two blues greats named Sonny Boy Williamson who were probably the first two greatest blues harmonica players ever (though you could maybe throw Little Walter in there too).  The first gentleman named Sonny Boy Williamson was John Lee Williamson and the later one was Rice Miller.  Rice Miller is the one who did \\"Bring It on Home\\".<br /><br />I think it's crucially important to point these things out.  I don't mean to take a swipe at Led Zeppelin.  I'm a huge fan.  But to pretend that they wrote these songs is simply criminal.  I encourage fans of the album \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" to check out the original versions of these songs to see why Zepp dug them so much in the first place.<br /><br />For Sonny Boy Williamson I'd recommend the 2-CD \\"The Essential Sonny Boy Williamson\\" on MCA/Chess which has a cool version of \\"Bring it On Home\\".  It can also be found on the single CD \\"The Real Folk Blues\\" by Sonny Boy.<br /><br />For Howlin' Wolf's \\"Killing Floor\\", it can be found on many compilation CDs of his music such as the single CD \\"The Real Folk Blues\\", or the great 3-CD Chess box set \\"The Chess Box\\".  These also feature the great, stinging guitar work of Wolf's legendary longtime guitarist Hubert Sumlin.<br /><br />For Muddy Waters' \\"You Need Love\\" you can hear it on his 3-CD box on Chess records \\"The Chess Box\\".<br /><br />Youcan probably go listen to each of these songs right here on Amazon or some other website right now and hear for yourself what I'm saying.  It's just pretentious to act like Led Zeppelin wrote these songs when they didn't.  Frankly, I heard Zepp's versions of these songs WAY before I heard the originals.  Zeppelin's covers encouraged me to check out the original artists when I found out a few years later that they had been ripped off.  Since then I've become a huge fan of blues music, so while I'm grateful to Zepp for helping to introduce me to the music, I don't like seeing the true blues greats who inspired them continually being ignored and disrespected.<br /><br />My apologies if this has already been discussed.  There are hundreds of reviews here on this fantastic album so I didn't have time to look at all of them.  Like most others, I highly recommend it!!<br /><br />Just as an aside, it would seem that Zepp has quite a history of doing this sort of thing.  It's been said that even the song \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" was ripped off from a band in California that Jimmy Page had gone to see perform.  I think this is discussed a bit on the DVD \\"Inside Led Zeppelin 1968-1972\\".<br /><br />Another interesting thing that I didn't see noted in any reviews so far is the fact that John Bonham's drum solo on \\"Moby Dick\\" is played mostly with his hands (not sticks) on the drum set.  That's how he's able to get that conga drum \\"slap\\"-like sound on the drums in that solo.  I think he switches to sticks towards the end of the solo.  This is all a big part of why the solo is so amazing.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Media overrated it.  I don't know what the hype and controversy was all about.  It wasn't that great. Just good.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I enjoyed this futuristic spin on a classic tale, even more than I anticipated! I'm looking forward to Scarlet!!  : )
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Great game. Always a great way spend free time or way to waste time waiting for the doctor. Rocks that this was a FAOTD!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The end was a little confusing but I thought the story was creative and planned out great. It has a way of pulling you in and making you keep wanting to read more. I read this book in less than 24 hours
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Good stories as usual. The author is right on as usual. Love the location description. Details are just plain interesting.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is truly a compelling story that will leave you desperately needing more. A wonderful book with more to it than sex.
0307744434|4.0|I have to admit that I went into reading The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern kicking and screaming, but once finished, I wanted to kick myself for not reading it sooner. This is a very different kind of story, but one that is thought-provoking and captivating. Two characters are trapped from early childhood into a competition of magical abilities, one based on natural ability and one based on learned ability. The forum for this competition is a circus. However, this book is about so much more than competition and control; it is about freedom, love, friendship, and life's challenges. I do not want to say too much more as the story is complicated and layered; I don't think I could adequately describe it and do justice to this very original work. Take a leap of faith, and give The Night Circus a chance. I was pleasantly surprised. I hope that you will be too.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|I was really excited to play this game, but it wasn't what I expected. A lot of the abilities, like the pink bird, were dumb. I like the lightsaber swipe and the shooting, but not the black bird or the pink bird. Save your Monet and wait for the free version. really didn't enjoy what this app had. You also have to pay more just to unlock a planet. Not my favorite angry bird app. I took a survey, and 99 percent said they were board. Hint. They were kids. Save your cash and download angry birds space or some other app.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I am satisfied that plantronics sells replacement eartips. It is very easy to loose them when putting haedset in pocket, baggage, backpack with lots of stuffs and taking it from a bag full of things without care made loose mine. It nice product and easily changed.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I've played this game before, and it's great. It Isn't very slow on downloading, and Its very addictive. Once you play, you can't stop. The only thing I don't like about this, is you have to buy the danger zone planet. It's the most challenging planet. I also don't like how you have to aim to use an ability after you launch the yellow bird. I really love the updates. They really improve the game. Some of these levels are really difficult, so if you hate hard challenges, this app is not for you. I had to redo some of the levels 9 times just to beat it. I like challenges, but if you hate them, I bet you'll still like this app. I hope you'll download this app if you haven't. It's one of my favorite apps. I think it's the most popular angry birds app and the most fun. It also saves you money. Don't waste your money on the non free one. It's the same thing. I hope you find this review helpful.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|It's a great scifi and fun to watch good effects but I found it a little confusing. Not a whole lot of action, and some characters were annoying, but overall a good movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have had many students and friends read this book. So glad that this was the first book I chose to read on my new Kindle Fire. It was riveting!!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I've read all of Kathy Reichs books and this one is up there with all her best. I wish her TV show was more like her books!
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Had good intentions I guess, started off well with bad boy befriending smart girl who won't sleep with him, relationship grows slowly. About a quarter of the way thru feels like authors high school assistant took over writing it. Can't keep reading it, on to something else.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|I am only writing this spoiler-alert review because most people have already seen this movie:<br /><br />This time Michael Bay pushed science fiction beyond the limits of credibility, and that's where he lost me.<br /><br />I can see alien robots flying all over the place and destroying everything in their path, but THAT GIRL WITH THAT GUY WHO HAS NO JOB, AND NOT CHEATING ON HIM WITH HER ALPHA-MALE BILLIONAIRE BOSS? -ABSOLUTELY NO WAY!!!<br /><br />Now, to Michael Bay's credit: the acting and the special effects are incredible. Specially the scenes where she is riding in Sam's old deplorable car acting like it's no big deal for her. Those scenes do look real.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' was like nothing I have ever read before. It felt real and relate-able to me. The way the book is written (in letters) is really unique. Normally I don't like that kind of thing but this book turned out to be different as it was exactly how some teenagers think. Until I read my next book, this one is my favorite.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I saw the movie first which I loved. I have wAtched it four times. Having now read the book, I have to say the book is better because it is written from a first person point of view with Catniss' thoughts and her experiences whereas the movie was from a third person observer point of view. Both were quite effective.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I was very disappointed as a big fan of the previous RE movies I felt this was a let down!! Weak Plot Decent Action Scenes but very difficult to stay awake! Would have been worth $1.00 at Red Box but $3.99 Sucked!
B008CLI4N4|4.0|The show is a near-perfect representation of the novels, weaving fantasy and history together in a dirty game of life and death. The actors were carefully chosen and fit their roles beautifully.<br /><br />The packaging was what disappointed me.  There is a sleeve for a pamphlet describing the DVD features, but nothing is there. I like to know what the bonus features are before putting the disc in.  The actual box is great: solid and has well-chosen images of six of the main characters.<br />It also frustrates me when companies put only two episodes on each disc, especially for a show that has 10 episodes per season. That sort of thing just irks me in general.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Another great addition to the Ice Age series!  Loved the plot and the new characters! The actors were excellent and the cast is a great mix from the enertainment industry!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It is a fun game; just thought it would be more like the origional. All in all it is enjoyable to play.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|This is one of my favorites in all my opera DVDs.  Everything about this production is simply superb.  I first saw it on PBS, and fell in love with it.  When I found it on Amazon I was thrilled!  What a pleasure to own such a treasure!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A friend read this over Thanksgiving weekend and said she &#34;couldn't put it down!&#34;  I agree - it's well-written and great for anyone who like twists and turns in a novel.
B009CYCF5I|5.0|This is another great, great CD.  I love the fact that she can tell a story so well.  She may be a mother now but she has still got the attitude and force as in the past.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|It was just ok.  I didn't think it was as good<br />as previous Sherlock Holmes that I've seen.<br />I loaned it out and her comments were a little<br />better than mine.

B00992CF6W|4.0|I like it but a couple things really annoy me, first my person keeps shaking when i am mining making it really hard to mine, and i spawn in random places in my map every time i go in it, fix these and i would give it five stars in a heartbeat
B000FA57US|5.0|one of a number of the mchael myers we purchased because we love the movies and wanted to have the whole collection recommend highly
B009RI4FRU|3.0|I saw a preview for this on some really old recorded show and thought \\"why haven't I seen this already? Bruce Willis? Edward Norton? Bill Murray? I must watch it.\\" Turns out these stars are more of background characters. I hoped it would be funnier and less, I guess, poignant. As other reviewers said, this is a stylish movie. I loved the details. It was kind of funny because my husband is the boy scout type and I'm the one who would bring a suitcase of books (actually I'd just bring a Kindle but this it's set in 1965 so I get it). It was very cute. However, the part on the beach got a little too Blue Lagoon for me. My husband thought that part was why the movie wasn't mainstream popular. For some reason I was really annoyed with the part where Edward Norton jumps across the water to save the Khaki Scouts leader or whoever it was. Overall, this movie was an interesting change of pace but definitely not what I'd call a \\"must see.\\" Now I kind of want to watch the Royal Tenenbaums though.
B005MWPW86|5.0|craig is the funniest this is a must have he will have you in stitches, if you like comedy and love to laugh this is for you
B0056CUZRA|3.0|I really enjoyed the story particularly the fact that most of it lines up with actual historical events.  The only reason I didn't score it higher is because the author insisted on putting in sexual encounters on a regular basis. Some of these were too explicit and I wouldn't recommend these books to my teenage children as a result.  If I wanted porn I would have bought a dirty magazine! (not that I do).  It's a pity because apart from this I thought it was a very good read.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Really is a wonderful piece of art. Breath-taking plot. Spent 3 days to finish it. Revealed more details than the movie. What happened in the Vanger family was astonishing.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I love it! its really easy the first few levels but it gets really hard later on in the game.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Another great game from g5! Graphics and storyline are both enjoyable and quality is outstanding. Can't wait for my next new game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another winner from the depths of Grisham's fertile imagination. Well written (of course) with a sound believable plot and characters you really must discover more about by turning another page. Good enough to reread.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I really enjoyed this game, though I wish. It was a bit longer. A great way to pass the time!
0689815816|5.0|I gave it to my 4 month old granddaughter for Christmas.  Her 2 year old sister and 1 year old cousin immediately requested it to be reas to them over and over.
030758836X|5.0|Ever wonder how devious and deceptive some people are?  Well, read this book and find those adjectives on steroids. Loved the book. Couldn't put it down.  Enjoy!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|for a free game flow is really nice. the game itself is fun and the ads are not intrusive whatsoever.
B005EHQGTS|2.0|After weeks of trying to make it work, I cannot.  Contact was not helpful.  Still working.  Too bad you can't get money back on bad apps.<br /><br /> UPDATE:  AFTER COMPLAINING ABOUT THE APP A FEW TIMES, AMAZON MADE GOOD AND RETURNED MY COST.  THEY SAID IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MY LENOVO K1, EVEN THOUGH THE AMAZON WEBSITE SAYS IT IS.  SIDE NOTE:  THE SITE STILL SHOWS IT COMPATIBLE WITH LENOVO K1.  I RAISED THE RATING ON PRINCIPLE, BUT SINCE IT WON'T WORK, I CAN'T REALLY RATE IT.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that I bought the hardcover book AND the kindle version! This is by far my favorite Book of the Twilight Saga Series!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I do recommend this book.  Great mystery.  The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was because I wasn't on the edge of my seat throughout the book.  However, it was a fun read, with lots of twists and turns, and a surprise murderer.  From dance clubs to caves, to sightseeing and beaches, I loved the locale showcased in the book, in addition to the mystery itself.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have it on my smart phone as well as the new Kindle, good game, easy to use and pretty fast.
B0028ER4QE|5.0|My Boyfriend is really into the Doors and has a record player so I purchased this for him. He loves the record. It was in great condition.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I wanted something that I could look at quickly and see what I could expect in driving or flying, and currently flying for Christmas and New Years.<br /><br />I installed it on my new Christmas Kindle Fire HD gift and do like it and the speed and graphics.  I was going to also install it on my Droid Razr, and after reading the reviews on the phone version, have not done that because of the negative comments from phone users.  The users however for the Kindle were very high on it and I join them at this time, super product and is consistent with what I see when I bring up the Weather Channel every morning on the big screen.<br /><br />01/29/13 - update:<br /><br />I simply did not realize this feature or just skimmed by it.  There was a revolving circle that showed up a couple days ago, wondering what that ment I tapped on it and bingo here is the weather warning report for the Boise, Idaho surrounding area, up to 3\\" of snow fall, winds, travel advisories, an added benefit that just enhances this little jewel.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|this is great. I bought it for my dad to go with his ipod nano 6th generation. He said it is noticeable but does not really get in the way.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I needed an alarm clock that I could actually hear the alarm, I'm 68, hearing is heading South, so this works very well and it is pretty diverse in how you can display.<br /><br />I just sent an e-mail question to the company to ask if I simply missed the tab that allows you to set alarms in the future, that is for a calendar date like 3 weeks out.  Looks like all I can do is set an alarm for a week, but not a month out or 3 weeks.<br /><br />I hope they do allow that and I simply missed it.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|Beginning in chapter 6, whenever I click on an object (coffin, car, etc.)when the small screen pops up, it dims and won't respond.  Have restarted my Kindle thinking the device was the problem but this doesn't help.  It is charged.  Waste of money if I can't work it out.  Was great until this point.
B000062V9C|1.0|It did not play.  I bought this for my grandchildren and by the time they visited, I had discarded the papers.  It would not play on our DVD player.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter is a huge fan of this series and this book is yet another home run. She wanted this book as soon as she heard about it and couldn't wait to get it. She started reading it immediately upon receiving it and loves it. The seller was easy to buy from and the book arrived super fast!
0802473156|5.0|The CD's were very interesting.  I was surprised how quickly we finished listening to them.  I would recommend them to any couple planning to get married or even married couples--whether married for a short time or for many years.  Can't wait to read the book, too.
B0049CVUNG|3.0|I KNOW I would love this DVD if I were only able to view it.  I was unaware that it would not play on an American Blu-ray or regular DVD system.  It works on my  computer, but I don't get the complete effect sitting in front of the computer as I would watching my big-screen TV.  Very disappointing!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely loved the book, can't wait to read the second! Could not put the book Down hoping the second and third are,even better.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|I installed the app on my Kindle Fire, but upon opening the app I was met with an error message informing me that I do not own the app... They were perfectly happy taking my £1.99 just minutes ago! I demand a refund for this non-functional rubbish.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I gave this book a four star rating because I think it deserves it. I really like how the series always falls into place when you read the next book after the next. I think the part about Manny 's imaginary friends was hysterical and it really fit his young character. What I really like about the whole series is at the ending it always has something to do with the middle part of the story. However,I personally think they should've made a more specific ending because I really didn't see how the ending really tied into the story. Other than that,I really enjoyed the book.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|I had nearly forgotten about Rodriguez untill someone took me to the movie - &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34;<br />His music is fantastic to chill out to.<br /><br />The purchase from Amazon was quick, painless and we were listening to the 1st track before the entire download was done.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's the best game... and it's really fun. I am level 15! I don't know who wouldn't want this.... if they do... they must be mad!
B00479SVBU|5.0|Wow... This device is pretty cool!  It took about an hour to figure out all the in's & out's of it, but now that I know how it works, we're good to go.  It would not load when we plugged in an iPod, but a thumb drive worked perfect.  I first downloaded songs I wanted in separate folders, then plugged it into the Soundfly in the car.  I recommend separating artists or genres into folders, so it's easy to listen to the music you're in the mood for in the car with the push of a couple buttons.  I did notice something that might upset some people.  The Soundfly HAS GOT TO BE plugged into a car plug close to the radio.  If your car plug is farther than a foot away (maybe in the console), the sound quality starts to deteriorate.  Overall, we are very happy with the price and quality of this product.
0385366752|2.0|I love the writing here, but what is the deal with the people they hired to do the reading?  The narration is divided between Amy -- the &#34;gone girl&#34; in the title and Nick, her husband and prime suspect in her disappearance.  The girl is better than the guy but that isn't saying much.  All the earnest drama of a college scene study class read through.  After a while it becomes unlistenable.  Wait till you have a week off and then do your own reading.
B009AOFNU4|4.0|Greetings Amazonian,<br /><br />So you have a tablet and a phone either from the holidays or previously purchased...<br /><br />I love gaming. I have to say, on tablets/phones, the gaming experience has evolved impressively. The only quirk for most serious gamers on the go, is the lack of a controller for precise movements. There are just some games that lack good controls, because you have to use a touchscreen which promotes fatigue and not to mention the friction you'll undoubtedly experience after gaming for over a hour.<br /><br />Naturally, I looked into controllers for my Android tech. I literally own them all. I will post pictures for the non believers.<br /><br />Gamestop controller > Not a bad controller, but horrible company support and cheap feel to it. It was extremely large, but very comfortable overall. Battery life overall was decent while the buttons felt a little wobbly.<br /><br />Nyko Playpad > Here's a controller I had high hopes about. I've used Nyko products for years and have more good things to say than bad. That being said, the controller was awkwardly stiff. Not to mention, the software was lack luster and cumbersome to use. I did enjoy the case the playpad came with that triples as storage/protection/stand. The battery life is very short.<br /><br />Moga > Now here's a controller that took things to a serious level. Great battery life and it felt very sturdy. The phone holster hook is brilliant and secures your phone at an ideal viewing angle. The software is a bit clunky and sluggish. Luckily, there is a free Moga universal IME app to save the day and the product really. This controller has a lot of developer following which makes it a great contender; in case you can't afford the SteelSeries Free controller. The absence of the D-pad really bugged me. I use emulators and some of the older games just play so much better with a D-Pad.<br /><br />Now on to the star of the review :)<br /><br />Pros><br />-Light weight and ultra portable gaming controller; this thing is remarkably compact and easy to slip in any pocket.<br />-Battery life is amazing. I use it quite often, as I travel for work, and it can hold it's own for a long time before a charge. Also, you can charge it anywhere you plug a usb cable. I've charged it in my car or notebook computer.<br />-D_Pad! Finally a responsive controller with all the bells and a great feeling D-pad.<br />-This product is very well made. The buttons are snug and tight. The controller is lightly rubberized to prevent slipping for extended use.<br />-No apps required to get it working. I have a Galaxy S3 (jelly bean) and a Nexus Tab 7 (jelly bean) and the device pairs easily via bluetooth and doesn't need any extra apps to get it working. It's literally pair and play, LOL :)<br />-Android, PC, Mac and & IOS compatible<br /><br />Cons><br />-This is my personal opinion of course, but I believe this controller is almost a bit too small. I'm no giant, but I'm no dwarf either. I'm average size 6'1 with fairly large male hands. I wish the controller was a tad larger for male users. I mean face it, men are the target audience here (no disrespect to female gamers).<br />-The L and R feel a bit stiff. The other buttons are smooth and have good balance to them. The two top buttons are a bit tough and a little awkward.<br />-The price tag is a pinch unfair. Granted, I got this a stocking stuffer gift from my gf, this controller is expensive. They should bring this price down in order to let more gamers experience and own this product. That being said, it is worth saving up and buying this product regardless.<br /><br />Conclusion: If you have the cash, just buy this controller already! Look at it this way, you could purchase yourself two cheaper controllers and not really love them and end up paying more than the value of this SteelSeries controller. Better yet, you can save or use your money on a controller that delivers on every level and save yourself the hassle of a poorpurchasing experience.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful!purchasing experience.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful!

Broadway quality but it fits her..she engaged and we all know she doesn't focus 100 on dancing because she actually sings.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning from the outfits to stage.I am most proud of her vocals because that training has been paying off.I would hope that u would purchase this item if only for \\"Breaking Dishes\\"..btw she is very humanized in this dvd with the behind the scenes.She is followed through promo and the making of Talk That Talk..you will enjoy
B001JRB16U|5.0|I have always enjoyed this movie, but my VCR wore out and I needed an updated version.  This one with all the extras was even better than the original one I had.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|After reading only 27% of the book it seems repetitive in making its points.... A story with little worthy plot.......
B001OGWY1W|3.0|I barely remember watching this. Weak story and weak performances. In the comics Batman and Bruce Wayne were big hulking guys. That helped with my suspension of disbelief. Making these guys heart throbby is obviously the idea of Hollywood suits. It sometimes works in favor of their bottom line but not this time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am addicted to this game. Lots of fun. Sometimes one needs a mindless game to play and relax from the normal everyday toils.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John grisham at his finest i don't know how he does it ???<br />good from cover to cover couldn't put it down..
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I like every thing he writes.  This book was outstanding and should be required reading for those that do not rremember that horrible war.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was AMAZING! I couldn't put it down and now I can't wait to start reading the next book.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|A great novel bringing history to life. A reminder of the war many have forgotten and wonderful characters that we felt we knew.

B00APUQPX6|5.0|Kids loved it. A very entertaining movie with moral lessons brought out. Loved hearing their little laughs fill the house.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I took my time reading this and enjoyed the book, getting ready to order the next in the series in the near future,,,,,
B00846REIS|3.0|The book was fun to read. They make a great couple but I didn't like how needy he was and begging her to not leave him. I think of a dominant as demanding and sure of himself. Other than that I'm excited to read the next book.
0525478817|5.0|Hazel is a brilliant character that I understood way to well. I have been chronically sick for five years, and while it is a totally different disease. I have felt the sense of impending doom that Hazel has. I also understood what it meant to be a professional sick teen, because I lived it for two years. Green captured this aspect perfectly. I found it hard to read at times, because the emotions still exist in me from those experiences. Augustus was amazing. He was witty and funny. I loved his personality. At times, there language seemed a bit dense, but after further thought, it fit the character in a immensely fantastic way. The parents were also involved in the book, which is something I love in Young Adult Fiction and definitely added to the story. The characters were amazing and made this book even more lovely.<br />The plot of the book was amazing. While it dealt with being sick, it also dealt with the miracle that is life. I loved the sense of adventure and humor that were tangled between ever single aspect of this book. I have been a fan of John Green for several years and was really excited for his new novel. His writing was just as magical and extraordinary. He captured the essence that exist when you are between being dead and healthy. A lot that he wrote, is something that I have thought or felt at some point since getting sick. There were a few small medical things that seemed wrong from my experiences in the last five years. At the same time, John Green's writing is executed in a beautiful matter that I couldn't help adoring this book. I highly recommend that you read this book as soon as possible. This story is full of emotions that will clutch your heart, long after you have finished it. It is one of my favorite books that I have read in a long time.
0938045768|5.0|Me being a personal trainer, you are always looking for ways to further your knowledge to become better at your craft.  I must say that this book has helped me create programs with great and sustainable results.  I have also seen tremendous gains in my personal fitness level.  I still feel that there is a place for weight training in one's fitness regime, but this is an excellent foundation to build on.  It is all a process.  True strength starts from within.  One must master their own body weight before anything else.  That is real strength.
0525423281|5.0|Stephanie Perkins has a fantastic gift with words and stories. I loved Anna and the French Kiss and found Lola and the Boy Next Door to be just as amazing. Lola seems to be eccentric and over the top. At least she seems that way at the beginning, but really she is a down to earth girl that really cares about her dads and Lindsey and has amazing plans for her future. I could really relate to her and totally loved Lola. I wasn't a huge fan of Max. He seemed like a jerk at times and their relationship was hugely just psychical. Lindsey was a great friend to Lola and I liked that she supported Lola, even when she didn't agree with her decisions. Lola's dads, Nathan and Andy were such characters. I loved how protective they were and that they were such a huge part of her life. For example, Lola had to check in with them every hour when she was with her boyfriend. I could relate to this, because my mom did that with me until I was 18. They were amazing parents. I love Cricket. He was such a sweet and amazing guy. Cricket and Lola were great friends and I liked that it slowly developed into more. There was so much tension between both of them that helped sell their feelings for each other. I knew that Anna and St. Clair would be in Lola and the Boy Next Door, but I didn't realize how instrumental, they would be to the plot. I loved how sweet their romance was in the book and that it also showed some of the sacrifices that they made to be with each other. The plot is full of tension, romance, and heartbreak. Every part of the book excited and interested me. Like with Anna and the French Kiss, I didn't want this book to end. I loved how detailed San Francisco was and I felt like I was in that city. Stephanie Perkins creates complex characters with flaws of their own, a exciting story that engages you along the way, and amazing writing filled with love and humor. There is so much that I love about this book that it is hard to explain. I definitely recommend this book to fans of Anna and the French Kiss and Sarah Dessen. This book is a must read. I can't wait for Isla and the Happily Ever After and whatever else Stephanie Perkins writes next.of Anna and the French Kiss and Sarah Dessen. This book is a must read.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Found this book entertaining and enlightening. Would recommend this to anyone who wants a good story. Some reviews on here call it boring because he did not go into a lot of detail regarding his kills or engagements. I think they missed the point of the book. Maybe they should go back and read the first chapter again.

B0063IH60K|4.0|4 stars should tell you everything.  The game is great.  I get carried away playing the game, sometimes until 2 in the morning.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm not much of a reader but I wanted to read this book before I saw the movie. Once I picked it up, I could not put it down and ended up finishing it in four days. I highly recommend this book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Have not received my Stylus pens yet.  Xfinity keeps asking me for a user ID and Password which I don't have.  I am not sure if I should request one because there not enough information if I have to pay for it or not.  I am afraid it is a trick and once I sign up they will start charging me Amazon account.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Awesome book would recommend to everyone and anyone who loves to read no matter the preferences this book has it all
B0058VW36U|5.0|Great Kindle App for kids.  Love this game lots of fun and challenging.  It doesn't get old. Definitely recommend it.
B005VTGB0S|3.0|Cover is good however it has a major limitation as you need to remove the band that holds the iPad every time you need to turn off.
B004YXE438|5.0|Fun colorful puzzles of different scenes and things.  Played the free version and liked it.  I would recommend it to others.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|I love this quirky song. The video is funny cause I know many girls that have made fools of themselves trying to impress a guy. I enjoy being able to buy one song that I like instead of a whole cd I might not like. I like to pick and chose and I listen to a wide variety of music and this is just one. Thanks.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|If you love music and comedy, you will like this. Not what I expected. Really glad I rented it. Yay
B003DT19F0|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter who loves all the Tinker Bell movies and always wants me to watch them with her. I ordered this and received it promptly and it was in excellent condition. I enjoyed snuggling in front of the TV with my granddaughter and watching it together. Thanks for the great time and memory.
B006LSZECO|4.0|So great. I literally couldn't put it down...but the ending was shockingly unsatisfying. I am going to check out her first two novels though. I can't wait, actually.
B00005JKZ3|5.0|I bought this to watch with my granddaughter. She had not seen any of the MIB movies and I finally introduced her to them. She enjoyed watching this with me and I loved watching it again. I also wanted this so we could go to the movie theater and see the 3rd MIB movie but wanted her to see them in order. This was a great purchase and It was in excellent condition. I am very happy with my purchase.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|This movie is a thriller kind, you just need to buy it and watch it, very strange movie about a ship that had got lost in the devils triangle. You just need to see it, if you like strange movies that make you think then this is the one for you. Came within a couple of days. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Thank you!!!
B0011E9LBI|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter so she could see it along with the 2nd one and then we went to the theater to see the 3rd one. She enjoyed this movie and I loved sharing it with her. It was in great condition and have no complaints. Shipping was fast and quality was great. Thanks.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|Great movie for the price, In wonderful condition with the case and artwork. The disc is in wonderful condition and We enjoyed watching it. Thank  you!!!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was excited to read this book given the synopsis. But shortly after I started reading it, I was disappointed. It's not as well written and definitely not suspenseful at all. I think that it was imaginative at best, but was left wanting more from the story. Thoroughly disappointed.
B008M721MS|1.0|The audio was horrible with the speakers or the headset.  The video was alright.  Controls, settings are minimal.  2 weeks after I started using skype on kindle fire hd, I had six unauthorized charges on my credit card from skype.  I have used skype on several computers for years, but never purchased anything.  The only way to connect my skype account with my credit card was amazon prime/kindle.  That's pretty sad.  Skype  is removed from my account.
0316019984|5.0|if you are a fan of any of the super heroes, this is the ultimate pop-up book.  It was my granddaughter's favorite Christmas gift, and there was some pretty heavy competition.  It is the most elaborate pop up book I have ever seen.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Different from the other books he's written.  Finished it not knowing if main character was good guy or bad guy and didn't really care!  Would recommend it to anyone who has read John Grisham.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love this show.  I can't wait until the season 3 part 2's come out in February 2013.  I watched all these in one day and loved them.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|I found the Maze Runner to be incredible!!! Something that I've noticed is that people are constantly comparing it to the Hunger Games. When I first got the book, I had finished reading the Hunger Games series (which I completely ADORE) and the only reason I picked up the book was because I thought they had the same theme and similar characters. Well.... I couldn't have been more WRONG (in a good way) I remember I was kind of confused and kind of bored with the beginning, but I can assure you I was hooked with the rest. I couldn't put the book down. True, the characters could've shown a bit more emotion, but I did share some of the same feelings Thomas did. For example: him and chuck. That was probably the cutest thing ever. In fact, the end of the book broke my heart because of it. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't as much romance as I wanted, but the book is so... amazing! :D
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My 3 year old loves this game. Very colorful and playful so it keeps her interested. I'm glad I found it!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'd already read Colleen Hoover's previous two books, so I knew this one would be great, but I wasn't prepared for the depth that this book would reach. So much is shocking and really makes the reader think to themselves, \\"What do *I* think about this situation?\\" And truthfully, I wouldn't agree with everything the characters believe or do, but it all comes together and is perfectly plausible that I can only respect the actions of each character as something that is true. This is the kind of book that stays with you... I finished the book a couple of days ago, yet had to think on it first before reviewing because it is so powerful and moving. Such a beautiful story. But be prepared: it's not a walk in the park emotionally! It's a poignant portrait of two people whose relationship allows them to move past harrowing situations.
B0060D10I2|5.0|For theater auditions, the role of Mad hatter or even Alice serves as a useful template. Loved watching multiple times for its good acting, screenplay and animations.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like how easy this app is to navigate.  It is much cleaner than the web version.  It is also easy to add locations when you are on the move.
B0022W6L6G|4.0|Nice album. I don't like today's raucous &#34;music&#34; so this suits me just fine. I loaded it on my Kindle Fire and shuffle it in with my other tracks.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|For someone who needs readers this is a great app!  The extra large numbers are easy to read and it is NOT a Texas Instrument, there are not a lot of functions I will never use.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Great story line, terrific writing and superb acting. I can now see why Bryan Cranston has won so many Emmys.<br />Looking forward to Season 2

B005H29GSI|1.0|Spent the last 30 minutes trying to assemble one tower for my son to destroy.  Couldn't get it to stay up as the picture showed.  Can't speak about the launcher because I never got a chance to use it...we gave up.  Big disappointment.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Although it was good the movie seemed to rely on special effects more than solid acting. I didn't feel like I really knew the characters very well. I didn't &#34;care&#34; about them which is an important element for me to really enjoy a movie.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|This click and play game works well, there a few glitches in it which kicked me out to the main menu but overall no real big deal! The puzzles are ok and make you think, but as often with these type of games you can hit on the answer with luck. Overall not a bad attempt at a puzzle based R.P.G
B008QE9VJI|4.0|Loved this movie, we thought Johnny Depp once again did a great job with wonderful supporting cast.  This movie had a couple surprise twists that surprised us.  Great fun.
B005ONTD42|5.0|I got this for my GF and i to use with our dog and we love it. It was easy to use and charges quickly. the app for the iPad and iPhone work easily & well. Its a lot of fun for you to see the dog swat and chase after it but I would recommend it for large dogs or dogs with powerful jaws. all in all def worth the cash
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|I originally purchased this because the scene in the church is filmed in my own church, but after watching it i loved it. Wes Anderson knows how to make a movie that is so unique, strange, and visually appealing that it simply captivates the audience.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I wasn't even going to watch the movie..I mean Tom Cruise as a rock star? Well maybe he will be equally as good as Jack Reacher in his new movie..even if he is a foot shorter than the book character..lol!<br /><br />I am no longer a fan of Mr. Cruise and haven't spent any money on his work in quite some time, but I have to say..He is a pretty good rock star in this piece, even his singing is damned good. The movie was a very pleasant surprise. The whole cast at first seemed out of character but I have to admit they PULLED IT OFF BIG TIME! I liked all of the versions of some of the best rock music ever.<br /><br />So now I have to \\"eat my words\\" where Cruise is concerned. I bought the movie and the CD.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|this is visually and mentally stimulating! although I am truly struggling with a couple levels, but if you like a nice puzzle that looks nice as well you'll enjoy this game! But definitely think outside of the box
0439023483|5.0|This was like a breath of fresh air. A for YA that was not about vampires or werewolves. This story reminded me of ancient times. This whole series was like a Greek tragedy. For her it would always come down to two options and neither where good. and it even reminded me of  the Romans as well. One because of them going into an arena and fighting for there lives like Gladiators.  And even some of there names where Roman. Over all this was a beautiful tragic story.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Every time I log on it says that there's an update available but it won't let me update it but other than that it's a grate game but I hate hate hate hate blyth so so so much I liked that the pet's ruled now there really pet's :/ :( :)
B007N8RULO|4.0|I really enjoy this game, it is addicting. The only negative is when you just tap a card to another pile, if there are 2 possibilities, it doesn't go to the pile with the most cards in it. Logically thats what you want it to do, so its an extra move to get it to the pile with the most cards in it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I laughed ... I cried ... but I couldn't put it down. This is, without a doubt, one of the BEST books I have read in a long time. The raw emotion from the beginning had me hooked.
B008MEM24S|5.0|love it.! just enough challenge to keep you interested yet not too tough! good for all ages! love the characters!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing! I've never read a book so fast and enjoyed one as much as I did this in my entire life.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|I really wanted to like this series.<br /><br />The writing is some of the worst I have read in a long time. I found myself rolling my eyes at the tacky perverted descriptions of women and sex, which made it seem like more of an old man's gross fantasy than anything else. There is certainly a difference between a novel, with a decent plot, interesting and developing characters with a real sense of purpose, that happens to have sex and a trashy novel which seems to revolve around pointless insertions of text regarding someones figure that have really nothing to do with the action at hand.<br /><br />Ned Stark is two-dimensional and too &#34;good.&#34; The Lannisters, with one exception, are predictable. My feeling is that the author connects the most with (and perhaps the author is in fact) Tyrion, a dwarf who has a hard time getting the prettiest women and an even harder time proving his physical worth in the battlefield. He sort of turns himself into a mastermind and his insults are his armor against his complex regarding his size and his heartbreak regarding his father. Tyrion is perhaps the only readable and likable, although at times over the top, character in the whole novel.<br /><br />I read the first book and I watched the first two seasons of the show and I just can't say good things about it. I'll stick with Tolkien, thanks.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|In the previews it was hard to know what to make of \\"Pitch Perfect\\"; was it a film length rip off of \\"Glee\\", something similar to [[ASIN:B000I9X67W Drumline]] or [[ASIN:B0010EJFPG Bring It On: In It To Win It]]?  With a mostly no-name cast would it be any good?  I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised by not only how good it was, but how funny, albeit it in a slightly over-the-top way.  \\"Pitch Perfect\\" mines the trope of college life with incoming freshmen Beca (Anna Kendrick) and Jesse (Skylar Astin) at the fictional Barden University and their search to fit in on campus.  Beca aspires to become a successful record producer in LA and Jesse wants to score movies.  This plays out against a fierce competition on campus between four different acapella groups vying to attract top talent.  The all-girl Bellas are seeking to recover from a disastrous flop at nationals where they literally and figuratively blew chunks, leaving the all-male Treble Makers to clinch yet another win.  But the talent pool for the Bellas isn't as deep as they hoped, especially given their tendency towards model-thin glamazons who can sing.  The talent that shows up is almost out of central casting, the quiet Asian girl, the loud brash plus-sized girl, and so on.  Reluctantly Beca decides to try out and becomes part of the oddball ensemble and unfortunately for her Jesse joins the Trebles, setting up a problem as the Bellas aren't allowed to date or fool around with any of the Trebles lest they be kicked out of the group.  Tensions come in the will they, won't they dynamic between Beca and Jesse and as the Bellas desperately try and come together as a group, as often failing as they succeed.  There are a lot of hilarious moments in the films and the cast is, to use an appropriate term, pitch perfect.  Adam DeVine (of Comedy Central's \\"Workaholics\\") is outstanding, all swagger and bravado, as the leader of the Trebles and pretty much steals the show as does Rebel Wilson ([[ASIN:B00466HN7M Bridesmaids]]) as the lusty, self-confident, and uninhibited Fat Amy. The script and book by Kay Cannon and Mickey Rapkin keeps the laughs coming and some of the scenes are truly hilarious.  The production numbers are also well done and rival anything you would see on \\"Glee\\" and contrary to what other reviewers have said I thought the singing was quite good.  Sure, the script relies on some stereotyped characters and stock casting types, it's a bit screwball and at times over the top, but it's a fantasy, not reality.<br /><br />So is \\"Pitch Perfect\\" good?  I'd give that an almost unqualified yes.  Don't expect that this will be one of the best or funniest movies you'll ever see and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  The ensemble cast works so well you'd almost assume these folks have been working together for ages as they have a wonderfully natural chemistry and play well off each other.  The characters they create are eminently believable even if they're amped up for comedic effect.  What you'll see here is the next generation of top comedic actors and I have a hunch many here will go on to much bigger things.  My hunch is we'll be looking back at this in a few years as the launch pad for a generation of sharp comedic talent.N:B00466HN7M Bridesmaids]]) as the lusty, self-confident, and uninhibited Fat Amy.

B000SEGUDE|4.0|I flew through the first half up to the post-apocalyptic chapter. That chapter took me forever to get through. I have no idea why other than I just did not enjoy it as much as the previous. I know it was not the language as I'm sort of in linguistics/language study so that in of itself is not the problem.<br /><br />Anyways, it gets better again after one trudges through that long chapter. The themes of overcoming the various trials regarding the human condition, love, and violence make the novel worth the read.
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|Keep in mind that this isn't musical and you'll enjoy, watch it looking for action, special effects and such and you'll be disappointed.  If you grew up in the eighties, the soundtrack will take you back!
B009PF93LS|5.0|this guy is great recorded but even better in concert.  smoother than satin.  i bought the Michael Buble / Frank Sinatra also.
B0058BI864|5.0|Thank you Chuck Lorre for this hilarious fourth season with Sheldon and the gang.  This show has become one of our favorites.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Once you start the trilogy -  you can't stop until the last book is read. Fast action  - keeps you glued to the pages.
B001ASVXSE|5.0|If you are concerned about the sound quality of this set, don't worry. It's very good indeed. It's a kind of miracle what the EMI's  sound engineers have  achieved  : A clean, spacious and natural sound, without the usual brightness of many modern remasterings. A true gem.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once you start with the trilogy you know you will not stop untll the last book is read. A bit futuristic but enjoyable.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was different then I expected, in a good way! The letter format made it a quick read. I don't want to spoil the book so all I'll say is that I definitely recommend reading it. Awesome book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive when told about the books, but when i started reading I could not put them down.All books most enjoyable.
B007REV4YI|1.0|My observations/opinions:<br />(Contains spoilers)<br /><br />- The pre title sequence was the best part of the movie.<br />- The opening credits were overly dark, complete with grave stones and skulls. Say what? Please bring back the nude silhouettes, minus this new nonsense.<br />- Adele's theme song is decent, but not overly memorable.<br />- \\"Q\\" is now a nerd that looks about 15 years old.<br />- Bond's trademark charm seems to be completely absent these days.<br />- Miss Moneypenny is now a full blown field operative prior to taking to her desk, which seems a bit wacky. She was one of the better characters in the film though.<br />- So Bond gets a Walther PPK with a signature grip so only he can fire it. This was a cool concept... Back in 1989's License to Kill, where Bond had a custom rifle with a signature grip.<br />- The villain, portrayed by Javier Bardem (with bleached blonde hair) is just down right creepy and disturbing, and not in a \\"good villain\\" sort of way.<br />- The plot: A disgruntled former agent that feels betrayed and wants to expose undercover agents while exacting his revenge on \\"M\\". Not impressed.<br />- Ralph Fiennes fits in quite well, but I kept thinking \\"how did the English Patient get in here?!\\"<br />- Reintroducing the Aston Martin DB5. Cool from a nostalgic POV, but makes no sense whatsoever, being that the whole franchise has supposedly been rebooted. Then why would he have the exact same car (complete with ejector seat and twin machine guns) from Goldfinger, circa 1964? For reference, Daniel Craig was 4 at the time. Then to make it even worse, let's destroy the car just because we can!<br />- For about 1/3 of the movie, Bond needs a shave and sports graying stubble. This succeeds in making him look considerably older than he should. More so when he's sharing the screen with the teenage Quartermaster, aka \\"Q\\".<br />- Bond's short crew-cut dissolves even more of his Bond look, and makes Daniel Craig's elf ears overly prominent.<br />- We get to visit Bond's childhood home! A dark and dreary estate on a moor in Scotland. The brilliant plan is to lead the bad guy(s) there for a climactic shootout, while enlisting the help of the gamekeeper. Always a great way to revisit the old homestead!<br />- The title Skyfall simply refers to the name of the aforementioned estate. And here I initially thought it might refer to some intriguing plot. Silly me!<br />- Bond's timing is completely off, which leads to the untimely death of a Bond Girl. Note to Bond: You're supposed to make your move before the girl dies, not directly after! And of course, this doesn't even slightly concern our robotic Bond.<br />- Poor \\"M\\". What a lousy thing to do to Judi Dench's character.<br />- Skyfail<br /><br />In summary, I miss the Bond's of the past. I think this movie probably appeals more to viewers in their early 20's that haven't seen the majority of the previous films.<br /><br />The franchise took a massive nose dive with Die Another Day (even Pierce Brosnan laughs about the absurdity of the movie). Things briefly recovered with Casino Royale, then the descent resumed with Quantum of Solace, and now Skyfall. In my opinion, they have made a mess with their reboot attempts. They seem to be trying too hard while making strange decisions in the process.<br /><br />The movies are also coming across as exceedingly dark and Bond has very little charm these days. Having read most of the books, I think Timothy Dalton came closest to Ian Fleming's vision of James Bond.<br /><br />If they are so determined to wipe the slate clean and start things from the beginning, then we need a younger Bond. They are replacing everyone else with younger actors, so pretty soon Bond will be the oldest member of MI6, and that is bound to be a bit awkward.<br /><br />I won't hold my breath for the next installment. I may have to wait for the reboot of the franchise reboot, if that eventually happens. In the meantime, I'll pop in a DVD and enjoyone of my favorites, including For Your Eyes Only, The Living Daylights, Dr No, etc.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read, romantic, twists and turns, suspenseful. If you like NS, or if it's your first - you will not regret. Fast read too for those who like to read in a weekend.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Just not what I expected .. I like a good romance but just was not  my cup of tea..  Would not buy anymore
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I would let someone punch me in the face to get the last book early. It's that good. Get it.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|My daughters had already seen this, but I wanted to see it for myself.  While different than some previous Pixar offerings, it still told a good story about the sometimes difficult relationship a daughter and mother can have.  It's a good one to keep for family film night at home.
B00782O7IY|5.0|The movie is an  excellent film and enchanting filmscore<br />representing a great  storyline of an era that will never return.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|I had high expectations for the conclusion to the Christopher Nolan trilogy of Batman stories.  Unfortunately, he fell flat.  I have no issue with writers and directors taking liberties with characters, but if the only similarity you are going to keep is the name, why bother?  It is like he forgot what his formula was.  I was very disappointed.
1416589473|5.0|This book is an amazing read with an unexpected ending. I loved reading it and highly recommend the book to everyone I talk to that plays the game and even to those that doesn't. It has action, a \\"blossoming\\" romance, distrust, betrayal, and self-sacrifice. Again it's and amazing read I loved this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was better then the movie,only because the details that were not in the movie made the story that much better,made the characters just a bit more real
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Very detailed stories and descriptions, funny at times and shocking for most of the part. If you love food, whether you like cooking or not, you will enjoy this book. Be prepared to go on a rollercoaster journey uncovering some shocking secrets!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I always seem to come back to this movie throughout the years and end up noticing one amazing thing I never noticed before. That certainly speaks to the amazing detail in this film. One of my favorite parts is when the main character puts on her shoes in a rush and taps them against the floor to get them on, which is what a real child would do. Honestly, Miyazaki is a genius. This is one of the only films that I think is a great movie for people of all ages that actually want to be entertained. If you haven't owned this film, you need to buy it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very great game . Plus it encourages you to play more and collect a . Lot of prizes!<br />It also has a twist and nice graphics
B009D0LBRO|1.0|I didn't even get a chance to play. Says that it needs to add data. A LOT! I uninstalled it right away from my kindle fire. WASTE OF $1.00!<br /><br />DONT BUY IF YOU ARE SMART ENOUGH.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing. It completely envelops the reader into the story. A must read. Great action packed novel that will leave you on the edge of your seat.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|loved this game.....dear stuck .near the shed is a pully that you must use to pull car out from hillside..there is a &quot;cheat sheet &quot; on the left hand side under &quot;tools&quot; ...hope this helps!
1451613512|5.0|Americans are regularly fed a diet that emphasizes 'American exceptionalism' and the doctrine that it is our special role to bring freedom and justice to the rest of the world. This Stone/Kuznick work re-examines the incredible damage we have done, both to others and ourselves, in the supposed pursuit of that role. To be fair, the authors declare up front that they didn't try to provide a balanced accounting - instead, they focused on what the U.S. has done wrong, asking why we have military bases in 132 nations, the only developed nation without universal health care, and have such a lopsided division of income and wealth (the six Walton heirs have wealth equal to the bottom 30% of Americans, per Stiglitz; the Economic Policy Institute has concluded that the top 1% of Americans have more wealth than the bottom 90%). While America doesn't have a de facto empire such as England, France, and others had pre-WWII, we've tried to build a far bigger empire than any in history via economic pressures and incentives that often include trade pacts that cost American workers their jobs, along with numerous murderous CIA-led coups and/or military interventions to topple 'dangerous governments.' Harvard historian Niall Ferguson, however, reminds us that there have been sixty-nine prior empires, all seen as exceptional at the time, and now long gone. The signs of our coming demise are already obvious - our floundering wars in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, becoming the world's largest debtor nation while also accumulating federal deficits that now approximate our GDP, an economy that has yet to recover from the 2007-08 collapse largely caused by deregulation - and we still lack adequate protection from encountering a repeat, a paralyzed government, an inability to protect ourselves from terrorism, the world's highest murder rate, a paranoid fear of Communist aggression, and our 'mighty Navy' becoming vulnerable to asymmetric warfare from China, Iran, and Russia.<br /><br />One of the first myths to fall in Stone/Kuznick's book is the belief that the U.S. won WWII - turns out that the Soviet Union suffered an estimated 23.4 million deaths (about 14% of its population), the Third Reich an estimated 7.5 million (9%), and the U.S. 418,500 (0.32%). Germany lost over 6 million on the eastern front vs. Russia, compared to about 1 million on the western front and in the Mediterranean (Russia participated there as well). Until the Normandy invasion, the Red Army was regularly engaging over 200 enemy divisions, compared to the US. and Britain rarely facing more than ten.<br /><br />A second major myth is that it was necessary to drop two atomic bombs on Japan - to minimize overall casualties. Turns out that there was considerable evidence the Japanese wanted to surrender - the only impediment was their concern that our demand for 'unconditional surrender' included deposing/hanging the Emperor - a position they'd revered and worshipped since 660 B.C. The authors also present evidence that the real reason Truman authorized the bomb, despite opposition from military leaders (including Eisenhower), was to make a strong impression on Stalin. That it did - motivating him to accelerate Russian efforts to build their own.<br /><br />Many readers may have forgotten or been unaware of the litany of nations the U.S. then interfered in. The less obvious actions include helping Britain to overthrow Iran's elected government in 1953, providing aid to both Iran and Iraq in their long war, engineering the overthrow of Guatemala's Guaman, the Bay of Pigs fiasco, supporting the French in Indochina, invading the Dominican Republic in 1965, actively supporting a failed 1957 coup against Sukarno in Indonesia, the CIA's helping to overthrow Allende in 1964 Chile (also tried again in 1970), invading 1983 Grenada, snatching dictator Noriega out of 1989 Panama, supporting the Afghans vs. the Soviet Union (1979-1987), bombing Libya (2011), and now interfering with Iran's nuclear efforts.<br /><br />Vietnam-era 'deferments' by Republican hawks include Chiney (5), Bush (NG), New Gingrich, John Bolton (NG), Paul Wolfowitz, Scooter Libby, Richard Perle, Andrew Card, John Ashcroft (7), George Will, Gudy Giuliani, Phil Graham, Dennis Hastert, Joe Lieberman, Mitch McConnell, Clarence Thomas, Trent Lott, Richard Armey, Don Nickles, Elliott Abrams, Ken Starr, Kenneth Adelman, Jack Kemp (knee injury that didn't prevent 8 years of pro football), Rush Limbaugh (anal cyst).<br /><br />Carter's allowing Iran's deposed Shah into the U.S. is alleged to have provoked the hostage-taking at the U.S. Embassy. Reagan/Bush I are believed to have made secret sweetened offer to the Iranians to hold the hostages until Reagan took office (released the hostages that very day) - we later sold arms to Iran and used the money to provide arms to rebels in Central America.<br /><br />Under Reagan, the CIA missed the most important development in its history - the collapse of the Soviet Union and its empire - largely because of the hawkish culture (and purges) brought by Casey, Gates, and Bush I.<br /><br />Bush II, Rice, Ashcroft, Wolfowitz, and Rumsfeld all expressed a clear lack of interest in the bin Laden threat; several stated they didn't want to hear any more about it. 9/11 was then used to rationalize invading Iraq and Afghanistan, the Global War on Terror, torture, and now having 300,000+ sites listed as potential terrorism targets.<br /><br />The Iraq War was supposed to pay for itself; Stiglitz estimated its total cost at $3 trillion.<br /><br />Obama is moving to end the war in Afghanistan (though maintain some troops there), is encouraging India to build up forces near China's border, has stationed Marines in Australia (they've cut their own spending for defense to the lowest percentage of GDP since 1938), forming a Trans-Pacific Parnership for trade (sans China), and shifting naval forces to the Pacific.

B0063GORYU|4.0|the play feature everytime it goes to a buying apps screen which is annoying at the least wish I knew i couldturn it off
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I started reading at the end of the summer and have not gotten too deep into the book.  It was hard for me to get into the story.  Will give it another try after the holidays
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I can only finish one puzzle before  it freezes on me. I can't click anymore tiles and I have to redownload the app. Which I keep on doing because the fire game selection sucks and there aren't enough free books and since I broke my bank purchasing this device I now don't have enough money to make it useful. Thanks a lot Amazon.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|There were some very interesting parts that were hilarious and very unexpected . The story kept changing the plot/story<br />.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It had a good story line, good graphics, and fun puzzles. It was hard, but not too hard. Plus, the hints are nice. I cant wait for the next one!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Our daughter is 15, but has always been a Tinkerbell finatic.<br /><br />This movie was very enjoyable!  It shows a new side to Tinkerbell.<br />Cute movie...arrived in great condition.
B00068C7WA|3.0|This is NOT the definative Billy Joel one might want. While it contains a lot of his hits, it skips many others, like Top 10 hits You May Be Right, You're Only Human, Modern Woman, A Matter Of Trust, and I Go To Extremes, along with others that made the Top 20. In place of the big hits, we get drivel such as Scandinavian Skies, New York State of Mind, and Goodnight Saigon. That said, why did I buy this one? To get the edited single/radio versions of Piano Man, My Life, Just The Way You Are, We Didn't Start The Fire, and All About Soul. If you're like me, you'll need this CD for that reason alone. Now, if we could just get a volume 2 containing the missing pieces (in their single edits....please), I'll be very happy.
B000083C49|5.0|All the special features for this movie make it much worth the purchase. The two disc set is something I recommend.
B001RUXW48|5.0|great story line; real life, addressing moral and survival issues in life.<br /><br />well written and performed;<br /><br />first time using Amazon's video streaming feature. It was easy to use, no hiccups or delays of any kind. I am seriously thinking of using Amazon as my go-to site for viewing stream video<br /><br />Again amazed at the ease and video quality of your video streaming service!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Best movie seen in a long time! Many laughs, & we watched it 5 times in a row!  Definitely recommend this movie to others!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I loved catching the animals instead of just buying them straight up but I don't like paying for looking and catching animals even if you fail.
B000YGIIPO|4.0|Escape no flea your troubles in life and enter the world of Terry Pratchett every chance you get!  Loved it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love the way Charlie explains life. It's not just another teen angst book, it's about finding yourself....well more like finding hope when everything looks bleak. He reminds me to find moments where I feel infinite.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book gave a tremendous amount of food for thoughts making you realize what a gift everyday actually is and never rush time away
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this product because the way it breaks down the weather in my area not just generalization.  i had weather bug alot of times it wasn't working.I also like the news part and the map of the weather in my area.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a staple in anyone's game chest. It keeps on thinking and alert, and is just what we all need.  I especially like the  fact that we can chang the background and the card backs and faces.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I have looked for this movie and finally found it here.The movie is a great hit with me,I watch it with almost a cult following LOL!Beonce' nailed it when she sings the songs Etta James had sang and what can I say about Adrien Brody...I love anything he is in,he is so sexy!!! I recomend this movie with a 5 star rating!!! Amazon is a great place to deal with,they are fast and honest!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have enjoyed every new twist and turn that this gamee has shown me. I would recomend it to anyone who likes a little Brain Tickeling.
0141345659|5.0|Probably one the most beautifully written book I have ever read. It goes through the ups and down of living and dying. How one moment can change your life. Even though in a thousand years no one will ever remember it. Oblivion, is something you should never fear because its inevitable.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|I have not yet played this game. I just got it and I plan to spend many good times playing it
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Came into the Angry Birds scene a little late; 3 months ago but I have to say this version is more challenging and frustrating. I'm 44 and i find this to be fun and enjoyable during those 5-10 minutes of finding something to do.
B000002B2T|5.0|Sad I missed this one in the 90s :( at least I got it now. I also enjoyed the recording. They did it different back then... Not so loud and in your face.
B0063IH60K|1.0|This app has the most and longest ads I have ever seen in any app. I'll deal with ads for a free app, but these are simply ridiculous.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Wish it wasn't written in first person. But that's my only gripe. Excited for the next book:) starting it now!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The weather channel seems to be getting tougher to navigate lately.  Cant get weather in motion map to work. Probably because I can't figure out the &#34;kindle fire&#34;.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I was able to view 36 year old 35mm slides, and negatives that I had forgotten about......additionally they are stored digitally so that they can be viewed anytime.<br /><br />The scanner was easy to use, and I think the picture quality looks great.<br /><br />Once the photo's were stored on my laptop, I connected the laptop to a television via an HDMI cable and was able to show the photo's on television at a family gathering.....everyone enjoyed seeing the old photo's.
B001NHN7TU|5.0|Fun and story moves right along. Handymen and side kicking off each other,its great. Gross and Reba (guns guns guns). And the Monster great movie.  thanks agian Amazon  LJ
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Life of Pi kept me glued to the book. Part 1 was increasingly interesting. Part 2 was intense, at times becoming a hit of the drag yet the curiosity of what happens next is enough to push the reader to continue reading. Part three was a good enough conclusion to the book, yet I can't help but wonder what happens next after developing such a deep relationship with the protagonist of this book. Overall the book was very enjoyable, entertaining, and educational.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|Paul Newmam,what can one say. Great story,like the character a loner rule bender and strong willed. Hope the industry keeps putting more of the great movies on Blu-ray.  thanks much Amazon  LJ
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I thought the book was depressing and a little hard to follow towards the end. It's sad to think that some people are feeling like Charlie was.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|What can one say, Steven Spielberg all over it. And Ford at his best. I nerver saw all the movies till I bought this set.  thanks so much  LJ
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book. It was very realistic, down to earth, and relatable. The relationships and stories Charlie shares are truly amazing and a once in a lifetime kind of experience. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like an eye opening.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another great Harry Bosch read!  Harry Bosch has been around for about 20 or more years and I have read most of them, and this is a typical adventure.  I have met Michael Connelly and he is a very interesting person.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was good and cool but who was the person that made it and I want to know right now.<br />But so you know who I am try to say it and guest my name and my sister name now now
B007TK77QE|4.0|A simply exceptional portrayal of interpersonal and sociological relationships in small town England. Rowling has firmly established herself as an 'adult' author of note. Unable to put down this book.
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|The dialogue is juvenile but it is quite cute.  The game is a typical Nevosoft game; simple, fun and repetitve.  If you like hidden object games with easy puzzles to solve throughout, this game is for you.  Definitely worth the price for a few hours of mindless entertainment.<br />LizzieZ
B0015DWJX2|4.0|Great book worth a second read. Mix of comedy quirkiness and history in a unique presentation. I would read it again
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I won't reveal any spoilers, I'll just say that the first eight episodes of Season 3 continue to ramp up the intensity from the first two seasons.  If you loved seasons 1 and 2, you'll love Season 3 even more!
B007XIC1GI|5.0|I was impressed and it was something that made me think. I was surprised. I think he's an amazing writer.
B008N1V11U|3.0|Well I just &quot;beat&quot; the game...finally.  I'm using the Kindle Fire version and I had my fair share of lockups and even stranger, I was booted right out of gameolay to the Kindle 'desktop&quot; several times.  There were a few sections that I simply could not get through but after restarting the level (not just the checkpoint but the chapter), I was able to breeze through.  Amazing look and feel for such a small program, very impressed with that.  The story is good but I think there is too much hand to hand combat.  I must have fought 500 guys (maybe more).  The vehicles are pretty hard to control but luckily, you don't have to use them much.  There is absolutely no need ot advantage to buying all the crap  that Gameloft has for sale!  If you have the Kindle version, I suggest turning off the buy option as I twice nearly bought a bunch of credits by either tapping something inadvertently or maybe it's a feature?!  Worth the 99 cents but I'm glad I didn't pay 6.99 for it.  Oh what am I saying?  I got hours of gameplay out of this...most was fun.  Even 6.99 is OK...that's a latte!!  I may try Spiderman now!!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.
B0087ITBT8|3.0|Saw this at the movies this weekend with my sister, cousin and aunt.  In general we all seemed to like it (including the audience from what we could tell) but none of us raved about it...just a general like. A little humor but not the laugh out loud kind just a few things that might tickle your humor bone and make you smile/grin (or nudge your movie partner because you recognize that comment or trait in someone you know).<br /><br />Overall it was a nice story with a nice ending and mom and son are closer and better off for having been on that road trip - though it was not without the necessary emotional bumps and bruises that come with growth (or just plain being together).<br /><br />Well cast and good camera work.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  it's NOT a \\"must see\\" movie you'll love to watch over and over and tell all your friends they \\"have\\" to see it -- but it was a nice story worth seeing when you get around to it.<br /><br />=========================<br /><br />BTW ladies if you get fake nails please note Barbara's nails in this movie - THAT'S how a GOOD nail job should look.  Not those huge 1-inch wide, square, thick, crappy looking ones most women choose.  (Trust Barbara to get it right!)
B001A5HBAG|5.0|This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|My seven year old son downloaded this on his Kindle.  I am amazed that within a few minutes he was able to play &#34;Fur Elise&#34; by Beethoven.  What a great APP!  The keys are labeled with the notes and the music flows and shows you whether or not to hold a note long or short.  Love it!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.
B00280LYIC|4.0|The story is written well and easy to follow. I like that it hints at somethings, but leaves you guessing still.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I have played several games like this but have yet to play one that even compared.....I'm just so sad that it is over! I HIGHLY recommend downloading this app it is well worth the money and it works great on my kindle fire hd...no freezing, stalling, crashing, etc. The only problem I have with this game is that it was over way too soon! Don't get me wrong, it isn't a very short game....just wicked fun and I couldn't put it down. I do however recommend playing the more challenging mode, casual is a little too easy. Anyway....quit reading my rambling review and download it now! You'll be glad ya did;)
B002WBZD02|4.0|This was a great purchase. We were very satisfied and would recommend this vendor to others. The experience was positive.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Sort of an over the top version of a dysfunctional marriage after 31 years.  Acting is OK with three big name stars.  Glad I did not pay $8-10 dollars to see it.  Saw it with another couple and it was probably worth the $1.99 rental fee.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie on my pc while stuck at the Denver airport after missing a flight.  I even laughed out-loud, but I didn't mean to.  Very well done.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Emotion. Emotion. Emotion. A style of music that is attractive to anyone that can listen. Check out Babel, the new release.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is very Fun to play, and I can't wait to play more! It has a great storyline and it is Extremely addicting.
B007CKNX28|1.0|Come on Jack, what is the gimmick? I want riffs and unbelievable sounds, not ballads and remakes. I listened twice.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great game, but would love an update. I still waiting for it to get dark and a mob to come and attack me but it still doesn't do it. I'm wondering if there is something in the settings that can fix that.... the graphics are great, controls are fine, in General it's a pretty awesome game. I don't know if it's worth $6.99... but other then that I highly recommend this app.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|Fantastic talent. Some may find her style unusual, but the energy and talent in this work is rare indeed. The track &#34;How&#34; is absolutely stunning and is a must listen for anyone who has lost something dear to them.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Pretty simple game, but plenty of fun if you like the show. Options to buy help,  it's not too hard to get by without that.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this App is so worth buying!!! A friend recommended this to me and within the first five minutes  of playing I was hooked. THIS IS SO WORTH THE SEVEN DOLLARS!!!!!!!!
B004WR125O|1.0|I was unable to get this to work on my TX-NR509.  After doing some investigation on Onkyo support sites, I discovered that this device only works in networks where the SSID is being broadcast (even with the latest firmware installed on the receiver).  (A wireless network is actually much more secure if you don't broadcast the SSID - it can't be hacked if people don't know it's there).  I don't broadcast the SSID in my network, so this device won't work for me.<br /><br />This is the first time I've ever encountered a device that required the SSID to be broadcast.  Most networking devices allow the user to enter an SSID, and it's curious that Onkyo doesn't provide such a facility (could be due to limited memory on the receiver itself).  At any rate, since this device doesn't work on my network, I will be returning it.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Great lead character, generated interest in the follow on books.  The plot was fairly good. I will try some more Nelson DeMille.
B007FJFDXS|2.0|As much as I read the other reviews..I don't get it..it was very frustrating, and did not seem to work right...(or maybe it was me). Glad it was free, otherwise I would have been really upset..with myself.. the brick games are much more worth my time..
B000SVZIDA|5.0|Moulin Rouge is one of my favorite movies. The music is fabulous and acting our superb!  Nicole Kidman is delightful!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just buy it right now. If you're a girl, prepare to cry. This book is full of beautiful emotion and will make you appreciate life in a new light.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|It downloaded fine.Great music on this one.My daughter and I loved it!She's a great role model for young listeners too. :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It has been a very long since I read an entire book in one sitting.  Within 30 minutes of starting this book I knew I wasn't going to be able to put it down until I finiahed.  This story made me gasp, laugh out loud, and cry.  I fell in love with the characters and did not want the book to end.  I highly recommend this book!!!!!
0547884591|5.0|Third copy I've purchased.<br />One for me. To cook faster and better food. To eat better. To learn more faster (spanish & math).<br />One for my daughter: cooking, learning, living the good life.<br />One for my friend: so we can communicate on the same level.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Best Bruce Willis' movie since The Sixth Sense (1999). the picture is great and the plot develops very smooth, an entertaining movie.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|This game was too difficult to manuever through for me.  I had a hard time figuring out what to do next.
B000TENK4K|3.0|First of all its nothing compared to Discovery or Homework so i wouldn't recommend actually buying it but its good enough not to call it complete garbage so here's my review<br /><br />Emotion (10/10) just gets better and better as the track goes on and i can really feel the \\"emotion\\"<br /><br />Human After All (7/10) pretty catchy but a bit to repetitive, repeats \\"human\\" every 3 seconds<br /><br />Make Love (0/10) straight up BOOOOORING<br /><br />On Off (0/10) i don't know why this is even on the album, its just 19 seconds of a TV changing channels<br /><br />Robot Rock (9/10) hands down one of the best songs on here! The only reason i didn't give it a 10 is the repetition<br /><br />Steam Machine (5/10) boring and repetitive but its got a beat that makes it \\"OK\\" to listen to at times<br /><br />Technologic (10/10) impossible to not like this song, i love the high pitched voice saying everything xD<br /><br />Television Rules The Nation (6/10) boring and repetitive, but slightly catchy<br /><br />The Brainwasher (0/10) If you listen to this garbage enough, you will be brainwashed<br /><br />The Prime Time Of Your Life (0/10) half of it is a decent song and half of it is just white noise...garbage<br /><br />Overall Review (3/5) The albums not terrible but as a huge Daft Punk fan i think they could have done much much much better. Its like someone took them after Discovery and really did turn them into life-less robots. I don't know why the album is called \\"Human After All\\" cause it doesn't have too much soul, luckily the songs that aren't completely worthless on this album are really good :]
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good time killer for anytime, but not for the younger players who are beginning gamers. Cards are too small when device is in the vertical position.
1449417051|5.0|An excellent book and an excellent gift for any cat lover (or hater!). Lots of laughs all around, yes indeed.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This game is very much fun for the avid Star Wars fan.  Realistic characters, scenery and music makes this a great game to play anytime.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|enjoyed this sequel as much as the other two before it. Great one-liners and creative ways to connect to the earlier movies. I would recommend it for anyone who likes the first two movies.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|You couldn't ask for a better game to play.  Love the free coin option, and graphics.  The only drawback is the coin walls don't stay up long enough, and the rewards come in too close to the sides.
B00AEFVRB2|3.0|if u can appreciate your typical disfunctional texas trailer park family then this is the movie for u. all 5 main chracters are portrayed completely different it is inconcievable that they would ever find themselves in the same room let alone the same movie. yet for our entertainment here they R. mildly colorful movie. most adorable character dear old clueless dufuss &#34;DAD&#34;. i would have loved to have known more about the mother before joe killed her so that i could have hated her as much as everone else. And oh yeah, did joe and the 13 yo live happily ever after &#34;after she got outta jail that is&#34;?
B003H9M1QM|5.0|This is the first movie I remember seeing as a boy in the '50s. I bought this so I can share Dumbo with my grandson.
B00A23MVHA|5.0|I heard about Ted being a good movie and I guess my expectations were low despite the fact that everyone told me they liked it. I mean really, how good can a movie with a talking teddy bear be?  Well apparently really good which is unexpected. I enjoyed the movie it had me laughing a lot.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I've seen the movie adaptations but never read any of Nicholas Sparks' books. Wow! A huge mistake I've been making. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the way he writes. His characters came to life as I read and the details were wonderfully descriptive. You can identify with the characters and their emotions as you get wrapped up in the story. A great read!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read this book because I want to see the movie and I always try to read the book before seeing the movie when at all possible. I have to say that the book wasn't quite what I expected, but the unexpected can be quite a positive experience!  I still haven't seen the movie, but I doubt that it will do the book justice.  The writing was beautiful, the images so clear.  Yann Martel was masterful in his capturing every nuance -- humor, philosophy, sadness, anger, horror....
B00280LYIC|4.0|Great book!!  Can't wait to finish the series.  Percy is a delight to read and extremely entertaining.  I would recommend to friends.
B0032KLAKE|1.0|The acting is fine but the story has more obvious holes in it than you can shake a stick at.
B000W1W8W0|1.0|some idiot in the 1960s thought they could make Muddy more hip and commercial with this album. it's junk. if this was your first exposure to Muddy Waters you'd be forgiven for thinking he was no big deal.  his vocals are buried under a bunch of crummy over-the-top guitar playing and pushed aside by bass and drums that are way too busy. anybody who knows any of Muddy's classic chicago sides and has a working brain knows this is a piece of crap. avoid it, save your money. it doesn't work
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Boring.<br />Just didn't hold my attention.<br />Just a bunch of fist fighting.<br />Kept finding myself drifting off to something more interesting.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I was looking forward to another Resident Evil and I watched this entire movie expecting something to happen other than the group trying to escape.  All of a suddent the credits started to roll and I really felt like I had wasted my time.  I think they just wanted to throw another movie together to make money.  This didn't even make any sense; very disappointing.
B009VB97EY|3.0|If you're looking for Oscar-worthy storylines & acting, this us NOT the movie for you. If you're looking for eye candy with a back story based on Channing Tarum's life - you'll like this. I enjoyed it! I knew going in that my life wouldn't drastically change after seeing this but I did have a smile on my fact when finished!
B000SM7QUC|5.0|SIXX: AM Heroin Diaries Soundtrack is just that. Used in combination with the book of the same name, Nikki Sixx takes us through his nightmare addiction to Heroin among other things.<br />You hear & read a Rock Opera for the brain that pulls out your heart at times and you actually feel his fears, pain, regret, addiction through the use of the two media sources.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who wants an enlightening experience. Yes, you will cry. Yes, you will laugh (not at Nikki but at some of the commentary) but most of all you won't regret it one bit.<br /><br />Strap yourself in and get ready for the roller-coaster ride of a lifetime.
B00177YA1K|5.0|Funny movie and worth watching more than once. I like Will and Tommy together. They make a great comedy team.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This is an awesome series.  Can't wait until season 5 is available.  I'm sure we will have watched the previous seasons many times by then,
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Whoops I made my review for this one under Men in Black 2. I really enjoy science fiction movies. This one makes me wish they were real. So did the first two.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Installed the Amazon MP3 app on my Kindle Fire HD. I was so impressed with the ease of use, I'm actually considering selling my app iphone 4 for an android.  For me, the Amazon website is alot more user friendly than apple/iTunes.  I highly recommend Amazon.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|It's always great to see Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith together.And now they added Josh Brolin!! Can't beat that.
146500632X|5.0|My daughter is  a huge 1D fan and was very happy to  receive this high quality calendar as  one of her Christmas presents.
0547884591|5.0|Over the past month or so I've been reading The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life by Tim Ferriss, which is quite simply, nothing short of astonishing.<br /><br />While The 4-Hour Chef can definitely teach you a lot about cooking, it isn't just about cooking. It is also a book about learning, and it is a book full of fascinating information that you had no idea you were missing out on.<br /><br />I consider myself a fairly good cook, and was pleased to discover that I was doing a lot of things right - but even more pleased to find that the book was still full of plenty of interesting information. I would recommend it to newbies and chefs alike, because I think anyone could find something of interest within the pages.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to finish this book or not.  It was so slow in the beginning I almost gave up.  But then it picked up pace and I definitely enjoyed it.  A very strange plot though ... very strange.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book!!! It kept me guessing on what was gonna happen next! I can't wait to find more books by this author
0425252868|5.0|A Higher Call catches you off guard.  I looked forward to its release when word came that it was to be published and expected a story of the heroism of the American Pilot in getting his crew back safely.  I learned of that and more.  I learned of the German Pilot and his heroic and humanitarian actions that day.  I also learned of the conditions he had to fly in and of the other men of honor he flew with.  I learned that the actions and beliefs of his government were not the actions and beliefs of these Pilots who flew in defense of their country.  I learned how a short encounter 70 years ago turned into so much more later in the lives of these Patriots.  Some books you put down after finishing and move on to the next.  A Higher Call is not one of those books.  Thank you Mr. Makos and Thank You to Franz Stigler and Charles Brown!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|This app will not download on my Nexus book Tablet. Even the Amazon app will not work. This has everything I want to read only on my PC. This is not good unless you have a Kindle.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|My friend has this app, so I thought I would get it because I loved it. But it won't open, I click on it and the screen goes black and says it's not responding. Not worth 2 dollars, it won't even work.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I was fortunate enough to be 17 when this album came out and my friends and I loved it from the start. Great vendor and great deal... AAAAA+!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I enjoyed the first half of this book; however, as I read on, the author got into some technical descriptions that I found to be confusing because I'm not real familiar with medical issues.  Despite this, I felt it was well worth reading!
B009RI4FRU|3.0|DON'T REMEMBER EVER BUYING THIS, NOT EVEN AS A GIFT FOR ANYONE ELSE.  DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ASK ME TO RATE IT.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|This is our first Tinkerbell movie. It was a cute movie and the kids (ages 8, 5, and 3) loved it.  It is not the best movie ever, but it works for a fun family night.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once you start reading you wont be able to stop!! A heart throbbing novel that keeps you yearning for more!
B007HO392S|5.0|Her music just keeps getting better.  Each CD is better than the last.  Love Two Black Cadillac's, what a song.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This is not a very good dictionary.  I skipped a few pages but it doesn‘t list very many words in the book.
0142412147|5.0|Let It Snow is basically the most perfect holiday book ever. Could you really expect less from 3 amazing authors, though? First, I'll break it down into the tree stories.<br /><br />The Jubilee Express by Maureen Johnson<br />Take hilarious shenanigans, Christmas, and romance; mix them thoroughly and what do you end up with? Magic, I tell you, magic. I can't even count how many times I laughed out loud while reading this. I could read a whole book about Jubilee because she's unintentionally hilarious. Plus, she's the type of girl who'll trudge through 5 feet of snow by herself to go to a Waffle House and that's the type of girl I like to read about.<br />Her relationship with Stuart is good even though they had a lot of unnecessary miscommunication at the end. They start out as strangers (Stuart seeming a little more strange upon first glance) in a Waffle House then progress to friendly jabs at each other, and finally they realize that being together is kind of nice. Basically what I'm saying is that it all felt really natural except, you know, for the fact that the first night they met she slept on his couch...<br /><br />A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle by John Green<br />Mr. Green presents a familiar situation: guy friend and girl friend both like each other but neither realizes. Part of me was always going \\"Tobin, you idiot! Can you not see the googly eyes Duke is making and the massive elphant-sized hints she's dropping?!\\" But no, because I've totally been there. Before my (now) husband and I started dating I'm pretty sure everyone in the entire town knew we liked each other but could we see it? Hah, not a chance. So Tobin and Duke's relationship was predictable, but that didn't diminish its cuteness.<br />I liked that even though there were three (well, technically four, but he was mostly just on the phone) friends the third didn't just become a third wheel left out in the cold. JP (said third friend) was hilarious and had a great relationship with both Duke and Tobin and the story certainly wouldn't be the same without him.<br /><br />The Patron Saint of Pigs by Lauren Myracle<br />Myracle's story wasn't the laugh-out-loud hilarious type like the other two, but it kind of ended up balancing everything out. Now, it's pretty obvious within the first couple pages that this will be a coming-to-terms-with-the-fact-that-you-need-to-change type of story, but again, predictability isn't always a bad thing.<br />I didn't really understand Addie. All the people closest to her are telling her she's self-absorbed and she refuses to listen and just rattles off all the problems with her life instead. Plus, why in the world would you break up with someone if YOU are the cheater and your other half DOESN'T want to break up? I just don't get it. That's kind of the point of Addie, though. She's dramatic and just does things but you get to see her grow into a better person by the end.<br /><br />One of the best things about this little trio of stories is the way you get to watch them all come together. At first it's just a few references to people or happenings you heard about before, but then it all builds up into this giant avalanche of crossing paths and you see how everyone affected everyone else. It's pretty neat and (for the most part) believable too.<br /><br />The Nutshell: If you want a cute, funny winter read by some awesome authors then you simply must pick up Let It Snow<br /><br />Direct Hitd Tobin and the story certainly wouldn't be the same without him.<br /><br />The Patron Saint of Pigs by Lauren Myracle<br />Myracle's story wasn't the laugh-out-loud hilarious type like the other two, but it kind of ended up balancing everything out. Now, it's pretty obvious within the first couple pages that this will be a coming-to-terms-with-the-fact-that-you-need-to-change type of story, but again, predictability isn't always a bad thing.<br />I didn't really understand Addie.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. I liked the search and finds as well as the mystery. If you like mystery games this is one for you. I also like the hint bottom. It keeps you from getting aggravated and giving up on the game.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|my kids love these perplexes, they are very addictive, everytime they walk by they pick it up and play with it, trying to complete the course.
B0033PQXFA|5.0|I've read a lot of books on Aspergers because there are very few books on IPD or NLD out there. Most of them are aimed at the parents of recently diagnosed young children, but as an adult on the spectrum I was looking for a reference book that covered a broader range of issues. This was the only book I found that talked about the issues adults might encounter, possible solutions, and specifically, how Aspergers affects women, both directly and indirectly. Every other Aspergers book is basically useless after you have this one.
1449410243|5.0|Bought this for my cousin (who is cat obsessed) for Christmas. When she opened it we read it all the way through and laughed at every single sentence! Definitely worth buying!
B0083SBJXS|4.0|The movie is great, the blue ray quality is amazing, but like most production teams they didn't include many very good bonus features, which is half the reason to buy a hardcopy of a movie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love the game, But, I don't like the pop-up ads that appear when the deal is done. they are annoying.b
B000YMQI6E|5.0|Great movie! Would recommend it to people who love movies with a twist and anyone who is a Ryan G. Fan.
B006AN78XS|1.0|I was unable to watch this movie, the sound and the picture both halted and not in conjunction. It was a frustrating, regretful experience.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I think I like Lungs better as a whole, but Ceremonials has a couple of songs that blow the last album completely out of the water (like Seven Devils and Shake it Off). I bought this weeks ago, and I'm still listening to it every single day.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This one reminds me of the old glory days of Grisham, The Firm and The Pelican Brief. Superb, absolutely superb.
2070643026|5.0|Hard to find books in French at any bookstores- my son wanted for Christmas and was so happy to find the Harry Potter Books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read hundreds of books purchased on Amazon and don't remember reviewing one. But this book? Read it. It is beautiful and funny and sad and amazing.<br /><br />I enjoyed the author's Slammed books, but this one is deeper and a whole other level of skill and beauty. She tells a shocking story with grace and truth. Parts are brutal to read and the characters a little too perfect at times, their lines more what one would WANT to hear in a perfect world than what one would probably want...but Ms Hoover creates here an amazing, sexy, at times heartbreaking story, ironically, full of hope.<br /><br />Read it.
B0007LXPBI|4.0|Bought this for a &#34;camping&#34; sleepover birthday party because there are some great camping scenes.  The girls thought it was hilarious. We had some trouble with the DVD stopping and losing signal.  Replacement was easy (no shipping charges, UPS pickup scheduled for us.)
B009X01FJS|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my daughter and she LOVED it! Especially nice that it can stand both portrait and landscape. Good quality.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Overcome, be cranky, be cute.  Two really good actors and Justin didn't detract from the movie, he may make it in Hollywood.<br /><br />It was enjoyable and wasn't a wast of time.
1449410243|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my daughter and she loved it! Very funny - and true - observations on feline behavior.
B0000634BN|1.0|I do not blame the seller for this mistake ( which was clearly stated in the item description ) Just makes me wonder why a U.S. seller would sell a DVD for Region 2 ( Europe ) I was able to play the DVD on my PC and is an excellent movie ! Just be sure when you by this ( or any DVD ) through Amazon that you look for the right Region
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This DVD arrived and was well packed. &#34;Arthur Christmas&#34; is an amazing high quality animation that will be enjoyed by family members.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Justice was not served....I wish the hero of this story had been a hero in the end. I liked the character in the beginning.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|there is really nothing more to say.  this is just the best book EVER.  not just for network marketers or business people... your KIDS should read this even.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This is a terrific series. Easy to pick up, impossible to put down.  I plan on reading the entire series!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great for the free app it is. The ads aren't really any problem. Just wish I could move 3 cards at a time. *edit* oops! I guess you can...under settings. lol
B001EBV0IA|5.0|If you are at all a fan of the Spaghetti Western, this film will likely knock your socks off. The themes, characters, acting, dialogue and story are all 5 star.<br /><br />An old outlaw and gunslinger, William Munny is forced to confront the horrors of his criminal youth during a fever. He suffers the fever while reluctantly employed as a mercenary assassin at the behest of a group of prostitutes that did not receive justice at the hands of a small-town sheriff.<br /><br />The Sheriff, is not utterly corrupt or wicked, nor is any character in the story. The shades of grey are true to life and the viewer can find revulsion and sympathy in the well-told stories of it's diverse characters. The film comes together after Munny's old henchman dies during an interrogation for a crime he did not commit. William takes the news rather calmly while collecting payment for the assassinations and then picks up the bottle of whiskey he had shunned since his youth. He figuratively becomes the angel of death in the best cinematic shoot-out of all time.<br /><br />The last 20 minutes of this movie are burned into my memory as one of those moments that will stay with me for the rest of my life. I've seen it a dozen times and just typing this makes me want watch it again, I think I will.
B001706I5I|4.0|We have always loved the Grinch and Jim Carrey does a great job! It was fun to watch it again in BluRay!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I REALLY love solitaire and the app works great. My only problem is that I cannot enlarge the numbers on the cards. I'm visually handicapped and being able to make the numbers on the cards bigger would be great. But overall the cards move really well and doesn't freeze.
B007Q1GJA6|5.0|This movie is pretty silly, but we have always loved it so we had to get it in Blu Ray.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Great game, however the Kindle Fire screen too small to really see tiles and enjoy<br />playing the game for very long
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|My favorite of all the Batman movies.  Couldn't leave my seat.  Not nearly as dark as previous ones.  Great movie!
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I purchased this lantern after Hurricane Sandy- it is bright and compact, easy to locate and I hope never to have to use it  for emergencies. Glad to know if I have an emergency, it will perform well.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I have to begin this review by saying no matter what I say about this book, my review cannot do it justice. No review could, in my opinion, do this book justice. The only way one could understand how truly earth-shatteringly-beautiful this story is would be to read it. It must be the envy of authors everywhere who have read it and cherished by every reader whose tears have splashed the pages (or their kindle) as they read it. It's not often I want to re-read a book, but this is one of them. This is one of those books that make you want to chase down other books to find one as great, knowing you likely will not, and one of those books that will make all other books pale in comparison for a long time. This book is simply stunning, and has fallen onto my list of all time favorite novels.<br />I also want to say what a surprise this novel was, which I suppose speaks a lot about me, too, and perhaps not in a good way. I read this book because it was lent to me by my brother-in-law's girlfriend. She gushed over it, but in the past her and I have no seemed to have similar tastes in books. I don't think she'd gotten through any books I've lent to her, and I can attest the reverse is true as well. This book was the exception. I received it thinking, \\"It can't be THAT good, not as good as she thinks.\\" It was in fact a bit snobby of me, as I was thinking that it's harder to please another writer than someone who only reads, so that even if she loved it, even if it was a great story, in all likelihood I wouldn't think it was very well written.<br />Add to this that the cover said, \\"Will appeal to fans of Stephenie Meyer's TWILIGHT,\\" and while I actually DID enjoy the story of the Twilight series, I didn't see this comment as a selling point. It actually cemented my thought that the book wouldn't be well written, and made me fear it might be a rip off. Now, I'm not one to judge books on similarity, mainly because it seems if you have a book with vampires in it, you're accused of ripping of Twilight. You know, because no one else wrote about vampires before Stephenie Meyer came along. So you aren't original like she was if you write about vampires. To be honest, a lot of books I have seen compared to Twilight I've always thought . . . well, not really. Not at all, actually. But people like to compare similarities to whatever is hot, so it happens. HOWEVER when I saw that comment on the BOOK COVER (which by the way is ALSO gorgeous!) I thought for sure I was about to read a copy-cat.<br />Boy was I wrong. The only reason this book might appeal to fans of twilight is because it's paranormal, but not in a supernatural creature kind of way and more in a The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold kind of way (as a comparison on the back cover mentioned). The other reason might be because this book EASILY will appeal to teens and adults alike. However, there are no vampires in this book and the writing is simply-yet-exquisite. Really, this book is in a different class than Twilight, and that is not a dig at Twilight; it's just that IF I STAY is really more of a masterpiece than a book. IF I STAY is more than epic. It creates a new standard.<br />WHAT I LIKED<br />So now that I've gushed and gushed without really telling you anything at all, let me tell you what I liked about this novel. And it's not a long list of things, really. It's ONE thing. One major thing.<br />The emotion.<br />I cannot remember the last time I've ever read such an emotional novel. Perhaps I never have. Perhaps I never will again. But I laughed and I cried and cheered characters on the whole way. If this book  does not make you cry, then you may want to visit a cardiologist to make sure your heart is functioning properly.<br />I also have to commend the writing. The author really did a breathtaking job, writing things in original ways without detracting from the story itself. The details were unique and made the story real, but never overwhelmed the narrative.<br />I loved most of the characters in the story, all of whom were SO fully developed and interesting and unique and many of them quirky as well, which I love. The story is creatively set up, so that there is as much (if not more) backstory than plot, and in any other book this would have been a criticism, but in this story it was just creative genius and it worked, REALLY worked. It was almost like a compilation of \\"slices of life\\" that came together to create a bigger emotional backbone to the story.<br />IF I STAY tugged at all the right emotions at all the right times. Some lines deliver a punch not because of what they say, but because of when it's said and what preceded it.<br />Buy this book to experience the emotion alone, because as much as this story centers around the topic of death, it's these emotions that we feel that mean we are alive. And I think when you read the book, you might discover that theme there as well, especially toward the end.<br />WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE<br />Not a lot to criticize on this title, and what I do have to say is minor, but here it goes. There was 1 missing word in the book. Really, this isn't much of a criticism because every author I know (myself included) would give ANYTHING for only one proofreading error to slip by unnoticed!<br />I didn't really understand Mia playing the air cello when she realized her parents had died. In the end, I understood her emotional distance while narrating (which also made the emotions in the story more poignant and allowed them to belong to the reader) but it just seemed like an odd reaction to have while overlooking the scene of her parents' death.<br />I didn't like the scene where the main character, Mia, plays Adam like a cello or he plays her like a guitar. That was just weird. I guess it was supposed to be a unique romantic moment, but I was just too busy thinking HOW WEIRD to enjoy it. Also, I didn't really love Mia. I didn't hate her, I guess just in some ways the attempts to make her look \\"deep\\" just came across as making her look whiny and clingy.<br />CLOSING THOUGHTS<br />I want to point out that each of my criticisms were VERY small things that only interrupted my thoughts for a few moments out of the hours I spent reading this story. In fact, I only mentioned them to make the point that, even when I am being my most critical, there is STILL next to nothing to dislike about this book. In the balance of good against bad, we're talking about an elephant against a grain of sand.<br />It's also worth noting that there is some strong language in this book (mostly use of the word s***). This doesn't bother me personally, but I mention it as some people like to know that about books that are marketed to Young Adults (this book is recommended for age 14+). I almost think adults would appreciate it even more, though! However, whatever age you are, you should give this book a try!<br />This is one of the best books I have EVER read. Some of the industry reviews on this novel called the book \\"poignant\\" \\"touching\\" \\"memorable\\" \\"dynamic\\" \\"powerful\\" \\"brutal\\" \\"heartbreaking\\" \\"masterful\\" \\"intensely moving\\" and \\"achingly beautiful\\".<br />I couldn't agree more.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Trespassing is perfect.  I love every song on the album + the bonus tracks.  I listen to Trespassing every day.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|A classic example of Vonnegut's views of human morality and nature in the face of determinism, Cat's Cradle entices you with a beautiful combination of science fiction and philosophical exploration.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Martin blindsides you in this book I don't want to spoil it by saying more, but at one point I put the book down in disbelief.  Great story...
B0091REZMW|5.0|love this app!! its a great way to pass the time, or just have some fun. there's always new quests so it never ends unlike other games! fun different modes to play and rooms to unlock. just all around great game! :)
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Definitely worth the read,  I won't hesitate to drop a series based on one bad book - this is NOT a bad book, but the other reviews were a bit too critical IMHO. Then again I had the luxury to read all 5 books straight through so far...if I had to wait 5 years for the book to come out I may have a different opinion.  I think people just didn't like it bc it didn't pick up with the characters everyone wondered about in book 3.  In my world...3 stars is a good rating.
B003FHMHPQ|5.0|Really interesting and cool read! Going to find Doreens other books about faeries now!  Also liked reading about some of the different hybrids.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I gave this book a 5  because  it had a lot of emotions in<br />it. Also  it  showed  you what a real book should be like.  P.s. Suzanne Collins is the best author ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005QUQP76|5.0|This is everything I wanted. It's perfect, it's very high performance. The snipe button is a great feature for gamers. It's got a bit of weight to it, which I love, I hate super light mice that shoot across my desk when I barely touch them. It does have a metal bottom, so be sure to use a mousepad if you like your desk unscratched. The mesh covered cord is great as well, doesn't tangle up to space and it survived my dog dragging it around.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app is dumb. Your Kindle already has a goood face book access.Plus it doesn't even work well on most devices
B009YP9L7U|4.0|What a great book. I never really under stood why men always gets it (love) untill the they loss something or when they think it's to late. Believe in the feeling, stop fighting it.
B009OYTIXS|1.0|Suffice it to say, the first, pilot episode was stupendously well done, action-packed and riveting.<br /><br />Beginning with the second episode and progressively getting worse with each new one, the series crashes into silly themes, totally implausible storylines, disconnected and under-developed characters of no depth.<br /><br />Bottomline: Watch episode #1 then save your money and call it quits.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So fun I'm addicted, I love this game it's great and FREE what an awesome app,, have fun it's really worth it
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|I like hidden object games and am forever searching for one that isn't just random images (most of which are lifted from the internet*) pasted willy nilly onto a background with no attempt to incorporate them into the environment.  This game isn't THAT bad when it comes to that, but is flawed in many other ways. You can pinch and zoom, but every touch is counted as a wrong click, which can be annoying. The rooms with the flashlight are even worse as moving the flashlight causes it to register as a false click as well. It doesn't seem to keep score or punish the player for it (I only play the untimed mode), but it is still annoying. My biggest issue is that it uses the same objects over and over with very little variety in the screens. I like the find the difference mini games but they are ridiculously easy. The game DOES save your progress; you just can't stop in the middle of a level. Since each level is only one or two screens of objects, it's not a hassle to start that level over if you quit. I really would not buy this game unless you REALLY love hidden object games.<br /><br />*A fun experiment: after playing for a while, do a Google image search for things like &quot;stone gargoyle,&quot; &quot;human skull,&quot; &quot;sceptre,&quot; &quot;sextant,&quot; well, you get the idea...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but I could not stop reading once I stared. The entire time I was cheering for Katniss and Peeta. I cried, I laughed, and I'm going to read the second book!
B008B11R1Q|1.0|I was really excited for this band's second album. However, I found that through my first listen I went from thinking that I would just have to grow accustomed to it to just absolutely never wanting to hear it again. It felt that every song was worse than the last. I've never in my life had a band that was so good in their first album and be, I'm sorry, absolute garbage in their second release. And I'm not one of those hipsters who say they only like the first album that was released before they were cool! This album just plain stinks. Biggest let down of the year.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|After spending a few hours reading and dissecting the diction in Asher's writing and the relatable events he used, I really began to fall in love with the concept and execution of this book. It honestly gets you thinking and  reflecting upon things you have  personally went through. As a teenager reading this, I saw a very realistic story begin to unfold. It was almost as if I was listening to the tapes myself; I longed to finish the book just to see  how it would end.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone thinking about suicide because  it can truly affect the way you view your decision and it can really teach you a lot about analyzing people and noticing signs that they're screaming for help silently.
0920236162|5.0|Love this book, as does my toddler. Nice to see a princess book that focuses on more than just looking pretty.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Pulled a lot of story lines together. Would have liked more insight into Pendergast's emotional landscape. Great twists and turns. A little fast here, a little slow there but overall a great addition to the series.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Zeptolabs makes,awesome,games and this one is very cute and fun. It is another challenge strategy and level puzzle that is on par with fruit monks and angry birds. I got this game for  my kindle fire HD and it works great!
B007SY3CEW|3.0|I love this app, it's fun and has inspired me to finally take up piano lessons, something I have wanted to do for ages. unfortunately the sound has stopped working, I've tried the free version and the sound was still working on that. also some songs have chords of three keys being pressed at the same time which you cannot do on the kindle fire.I'd like it to be fixed or get a refund as it was 1.99
B00355ORFG|3.0|When purchased I had expected that it would be a dvd of the actual concert itself, instead I got a cd of the concert version of the songs, and a dvd that shows the making of the music video for one of the songs. Also, I have yet to be able to actually listen to the cd as my computer doesn't recognize the format. May have to return if I'm unable to even listen to it. This was a christmas gift so I'm rather disappointed.
B0086900TI|5.0|Very similar story to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The other movie gives you hope but this movie is just a dead end with no way out.  Great movie.  The only thing I don't like is Lucy Liu.  She is not that good in this movie.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|My wife and I are fans of all the previous Resident Evil films, even though they are admittedly bad. This maybe is part of the charm. They are just fun and silly and laughable. Nothing to be taken too seriously. This last installment wasn't even fun. It was pretty much just the bad, with none of the silly charm that the others manage to harness. I recommend saving your money, and more importantly your time.
1250027624|5.0|Full of gorgeous photos and great period details, this book is a fan-pleasing delight. Now I want to get the earlier volume also.  Spoiler alert--this book contains some information that relates to Season 3.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this show! I love the wittiness of the lawyers n the lil bits of comedy! It's an awesome watch! Can't wait for season 3!
B005H9B44A|3.0|OMG, America!  Cradle of cinema, home to Hollywood!  Is this what it comes down to ... a $200 million comic book?  You can feel your IQ falling each minute of this computer-made flick.  If you really like mythology & sci-fi, I suggest a book -- \\"Ilium\\" by Dan Simmons.  Read it, & you'll realize that \\"Thor\\" is just a big yawn aimed at selling popcorn.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book more than any other books I'd ever read and every single second I could I would be nose deep in this book wanting more. This book is full of romance, edge, and wonder and I would recommend this book to all ages. I would also highly rank this book for the ending of romance but confusion, leaving me wanting more.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Perfect! It came within a reasonable amount of time.  The product was just as described.  I love it and so will you!
B0019N8P2W|4.0|I purchased this for someone as a christmas gift, She has been wanted it for a few years now.  I was able to get it for her. She was very happy.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Another of those games that you can't stop playing. Good graphics , different puzzles. You won't be bored. And a fun story line to boot.
B004HO6I4W|4.0|I purchased this for a gift.  They really liked it.  We also have the movie.  It is a great cute movie, my kids love it.. The person I bought for is like a kid at heart.  He will enjoy it was..
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|An interesting turn on &#34;be careful what you wish for.&#34; There isn't a lot of depth in the actual relationship between the guy and his bear but the off-color humor is enjoyable.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I wasn't able to get to the theatres for this one. but it was a great movie when it came out to rent.  We rented it and wow it was a great movie.  We have watched the iron man, captain america, thor movies and this was just a great one. can't wait to see the next installments of them
B007Y6OZE0|4.0|Offspring have been one of my favorite bands for years. I practically grew up with Ignition, Jennifer Lost the War and Smash. That said, I absolutely prefer their punk-rock sound over their poppy stuff. Ignition is hands down their best album, followed by Smash, Ixnay, Americana and self titled. Dividing By Zero could be on Ignition, where Slim Pickens could be on Americana.<br /><br />The rest of the album, honestly, is just so bad I wonder why they even bother. But for Slim Pickens and Diving By Zero, these songs are so good that it's the only reason to own this album. Or just purchase these 2 songs.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|This was a very cute movie. Great price when purchased, kids loved it.  I didn't think the movie was going to be like that but I liked it anyway as well..
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I enjoyed some of the cheesetastic earlier RE movies, so I thought, why not? I should have known when the 1-star reviews outnumbered the 5-star ones. This is like watching someone play a video game, except it's worse, because you don't get to make fun of them when they screw up and die. You'll find more engrossing plots in the movies that come in brown paper wrapping, and even if not, well, they'll still likely accomplish their purpose. I've seen Holocaust movies that were less joyless than this dreary death march of a movie.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I knew I had to order this movie as soon as it came out, because I absolutely loved it in theatres. The second time around - I loved it just as much!<br /><br />I like Anna Kendrick and Brittany Snow, and they do a fabulous job, but it's the full cast of characters, especially Rebel Wilson, that make this movie as fantastic as it is. Every time Fat Amy speaks, I laugh, and I'm sure I'm not alone.<br /><br />Just a really fun idea that may not have worked so well if it did not have the right actors playing these parts. The music is amazing. This is going to be a well watched DVD in my collection, that's for sure.
B005LAIGQ4|2.0|Predictable, but a good story for a child towatch in order to teach believing one can do anything and anything is possible. Good animal story.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|I look forward to the next installment of the series. I've read a number of Brandon's fictional works and really enjoy his stories.
B003UESJ9M|4.0|Different insde look of a country star being blinded by what her fans have to say about her. Liked the acting of all actors and literally have watched this show many times for both the music and actors.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I look forward to the next installment of the series. I've read all of the Game of Thrones books and can't wait for the next installment
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Great light anytime read. Fun story with depth enough for a smart reader. Loved the pace and the lessons. I think we can all apply a little in our everyday lives.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I look forward to the next installment of the series. I've read all of the Game of Thrones books and can't wait for the next installment
B004ZJZQ7O|1.0|The blu ray disc was not able to play.  I had to use the non blu ray disc.  I had a certified technician test it and it was un playable.
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|I look forward to the next installment of the series. I've read a number of Brandon's fictional works and really enjoy his stories.
B00ARAO1LC|4.0|Good cast. Mathew McConaughey's best work since Dazed and Confused. Emile Hirsch nails role of white trash idiot. Thomas Haden Church good as well
B002GYI9C4|4.0|I look forward to the next installment of the series. I've read a few of Brandon's fictional works and really enjoy his stories.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This is one of those books that, if you want to be a writer, should be in your library no matter what.  I bought a hardcopy of the 10th Anniversary addition at a local bookstore and have been drooling over getting the Kindle version (since I hate marking up physical books [unless of course it's Chaucer in Middle-English, and who doesn't need help reading that?]) and finally took the plunge when I realized that the current Kindle version has everything the 10th Anniversary Edition has in it.<br /><br />I'm not a Stephen King fan at all.  I've never read any of his other books and the short stories I've read of his weren't really my cup of tea (he's a good writer, I just like to read different stuff, and I don't drink tea).  I love his approach to how he opens up his methods of writing, giving the reader a peak inside the brain of a successful, working writer.  It's very conversationally written so it doesn't seem like he's talking down or lecturing to you, and it's chock full of tidbits of pracitcal wisdom found in no other book you'll find on writing anywhere.  If you were only to get one book on writing, this would be one of the finalists.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I look forward to the next installment of the series. I've read all of the Game of Thrones books and can't wait for the next installment
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved it. I laughed so hard, loving the sarcasm. Sky reminds me so much of me. Who wouldn't wAnt to love a guy like Dean? He was her knight in shinning armor without the cheesiness. He literally saved her. I love that she sees the good in the worst people. I cried because she hurt so bad. I felt like I was looking to Sky' s soul when she opened up to tell how she felt. I could literally go on all day. Definitely best of 2012¡!!!!!!
0307704076|5.0|This is the best motivation/business book I have ever read. It is succinct, creative, innovative. I highly recommend it to any and all professional types.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow Free is a great game to have when you're waiting around somewhere, or just want to kick back for a few minutes. My kids loved the easy levels, and I really enjoyed the 10x10 and up frames. You feel a nice little rush when you sole the 14x14 frames!
B00916TU00|5.0|Love this album! I have been waiting for Olly new music for a while...<br />Olly continues to get better and better each album.<br />This is the best yet!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is just a spectacular animated story.  Merida is the Princess daughter of King Fegus and the beautiful Queen Elinor.  Her mother wants her to be a perfect princess and a lady but Merida is a tom boy at heart with a passion for challenges and archery and she is really fearless.  When it comes time to match her up with a suitable suitor for a husband from the sons of the clan tribe leaders, Merida has her own ideas. She wants to be able to make her own decisions about how she will live her life....<br /><br />This is a very cute story and the CGI graphics were outstanding. This is a five star movie and it is an excellent film for children and adults alike.  The graphics design and animation of the film were some of the best that I have seen and the story line for the film was dramatic but well thought through.  The accents and the voices selected for the characters was just as well selected and performed.<br /><br />My wife and I thought the film had a good premise and it was great to see how the movie flowed and it never left the plot line, sticking to the final goal until the impeccable and exciting ending.  Disney and Pixar have another hit on their hands.  The film also had an excellent song track with some good music and songs and it really is a full package when it comes to an entertaining CGI adventure film.<br /><br />I rate this movie 5 stars and I recommend it to you.
B003L77G6A|5.0|The best surprise about ordering on-line is that your goods arrive exactly as described, quickly and without damage. Anything else makes you wish you had gone to a store and picked it up yourself. So, the Best Surprise is No Surprise.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book has romance, passion & fantasy.  I didn't like the few curse words.  Loved the heat between these 2 characters.  I give it 5 stars.

B0045XICB2|4.0|I've watched this movie a few times already, and each time it seems cheesier. The series gets better as It progresses. :) I rented it from Amazon to recap before going to watch breaking dawn pt. 2.

B006YXTRHY|5.0|This is a good series, in my opinion. I didn't read the books or anything, but have seen the movie once before renting it from Amazon. Watched it as a recap before watching Breaking Dawn pt. 2 in theaters.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This was another great book by Sparks. I couldn't put it down. This is a love story that will touch your heart.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|My husband and I saw the movie.  I purchased this for my grand children who had never seen it.  They enjoyed it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Perfect and extremely relatable. Loved this book. After reading this book, I feel as if I can accomplish anything and I can also be, infinite.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It Made me have  a different outlook on life. And I very much thank this book for that. Thank you!
B005K17RU0|3.0|looks like it would work,  but the frustraiting thing is that the app installs upside down on my kindle fire and doesnt flip when i tilt my kindle like all the other apps do.
B0018QPPXW|4.0|I bought this movie for my daughter who has been a Tom Cruise fan for more than 20 years.  It was one of his early movies and he looks so young in it.
B006HL9G10|5.0|The Insight Timer app is the best meditation timer in the market place.  The timer provides starting and ending reminders as well as a resonating bell of your choosing.  The Community feature is a great way to connect with other people who are meditating.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I originally saw this movie in the theater.  It is a fun movie with some poignant moments.  Fabulous cast.  Scenes of India were colorful and, according to my friends who have been there, totally accurate.
0316228532|2.0|I was so disappointed with this book. I have never read Harry Potter, so had no expectations except that she was writing a book for adults that got a lot of press. I found it tedious, slow, redundant, boring and focused much too much on the adolescent characters rather than the adults..
B005S9EJ46|5.0|The cast was terrific and the scenic design just perfect.  We enjoyed the character development and the sweet story line.
B0072IVGZG|1.0|No passion. They gave it great packaging but phoned in the actual music. Phony drivel, set to a driving beat.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|This movie was great very different type of role for Barbra Streisand but, you will get a good chuckle watching it since she has a great roll in this movie
B0000026DJ|5.0|Good on first listen, great by the third. A band with passion and conscience. Highly recommended. Good rock n roll too.
1419705849|3.0|My kids read this entire series and just loved but both really didn't seem to excited over this book. I have an 8 and 11 year old. They both completed it but not a word on how funny or good it was like all the rest. Perhaps they have just outgrown.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the several choices such as:<br />Type of play- winning,etc.<br />Did you want to auto complete or not?<br />This helps me decide what kind of solitaire I choose to play depending on how I answer these and other questions.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|Classic fun, reminds me of the Dreamcast game. For free how could someone go wrong. Puzzles so far have not been stressful.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover, Hopeless was unbelievable!  I wanted to start this book review by saying you rock my face but I feel guilty for doing that after just finishing your heart wrenching novel.  You did rock my face with the sweet romance between Sky & Holder but then you shattered my world when you revealed what Sky had been through.  It's probably not appropriate to mention how much I enjoyed Holder and his character at this time but he could be my new favorite fictional boy.  You are a brilliant writer and Hopeless proves that again for the 3rd time! Seriously, I would read it again right now but I know that I have to process the book first before I can consider doing that.<br /><br />All I can say is that I have read very few books that have made me laugh, cry, rail against humanity, hope for love, healing, and everything in between, but you have managed to do that with Hopeless.  And, the first kiss scene...let's just say it made me swoon.  Lordy! I so loved this book that I can't even put my thoughts down on paper properly!!<br /><br />In the effort to not give away any spoilers, I would just like to quote my favorite line from this book as it has special meaning to me at this time in my life, nothing as horrific as the subject matter discussed in Hopeless, but this line gives HOPE to those who may be suffering through their own personal issues...\\"The things that knock you down in life are tests, forcing you to make a choice between giving in and remaining on the ground or wiping the dirt off and standing up even taller than you did before you were knocked down.  I'm choosing to stand up taller.\\"<br /><br />Colleen, thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing your wonderful talents with the world!! I hope that everyone stops what they are doing to buy this book.  And, if it's your first ever Colleen Hoover book, go ahead and pick up Slammed and Point of Retreat because they will rock your face too.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app in my opinion is awesome, addicting, and easy. I can easily find what I'm looking for, follow others, and get ideas. If you find a recipe that I want to try I can just click on the given URL and I get the recipe just like that. Craft ideas simple! I just love Pinterest!
B005K17RU0|4.0|While always having been a fan of the weather channel on tv, I must say that I rather the accuweather app for Android more than the weather channel app because of the superior radar graphics.
B008476HBM|5.0|great read! Loved the electronic format even though it is a little different from have the feel of a book.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I know, not the most intellectual of movies, but fun!  A great way to &#34;get away&#34; for a little over an hour or so.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book was one of those you can't put down. Awesome character development. Guessing to the end! Very dark indeed.
B009POCG2C|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Eastwood, Addams and Timberlake all did a fantastic job. Amy Addams was especially surprising with her baseball lingo. Eastwood still has it after all these years too. This movie leaves you with a good feeling at the end so I recommend it. Its funny, heart felt and real. Just goes to show you that seeing isnt always believing. LOL
B008FRFN7A|4.0|this app works great on my kindle fire. l haven't figured out how to print to photo paper yet. I highly recommend it.
1607066017|5.0|If you are still reading comics you want to at least look at this one, as it is the most original cool one to come along this year.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I could hardly put it down. A new twist at every turn. Not sure I will ever think of marriage/relationships the same. Do we really know the person we're married too? This book may make you wonder.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Good sampling of songs from an amazing movie.  Some of the pieces are unnecessary and others should be s little longer.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|The name of this game meant absolutely nothing to me, but I'm glad I got it. It's essentially OutRun on a phone. I was amazed by how faithful it was, while still feeling like its own game. Given some of SEGA's output as of late, I'm not even sure they could do it better than this.<br /><br />The tilt controls work surprisingly well, although there's several control options that include an onscreen wheel. The graphics are retro, fun and fitting to the game (the car even flips out of control and dumps your characters onto the floor haha). The music is not bad either, although it seemed weird to me that you couldn't hear a preview of it when picking the song you want to hear on the select screen.<br /><br />Overall, a fun game that's easy to pick up and play in short bursts -- which personally is all I want from mobile games.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Easy and Fun to read. Mark Cuban shoots it straight, something everyone needs to do to themselves. The book supports the idea that you don't get &#34;lucky&#34;. With a lot of work and effort, and letting go of your fears, anyone can be successful in anyway they want.
0812984412|1.0|Terrible movie.  Someone bought my ticket, but I still want my money back!  An attempt at profound that entirely disappointed.  If the emperor has no clothes, Tom Hanks, this is no movie.<br />My only wish on this rating is that there would be a choice of negative stars, since I want my time back.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love it, read it three times. Can not get enough. Can not wait to read the second book for the continuation.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|I enjoyed reading the account given by Dr.Alexander during his tragic but enlightening experience while in a coma.<br />The seven days he spent in this predicament proofed very trying for his family.  The fact that he made a complete recovery and was guided through the eternal that can be possible after life on earth is indeed the light we all need to know is awaiting us all. Thank you for sharing this amazing experience with me.
B0086700CM|5.0|I played this on my daughters iPad and was hooked! We spent several hours laughing and having a good time trying to beat each other. When I got home, I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire and enjoy playing whenever I want too. The graphics are really good.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|I thought that Jennifer Egans book was very well constructed and took an interesting and thoughtful journey through time and the evolution of technology, through the eyes of characters that I lived to follow.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I came in perfect conditions and we like the serie.  Please let me know when you have the third season.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series will never get old! No matter how many times I read it!!! Definitely a work of art !
0142418471|5.0|This book was entertaining, fun and really funny. It's one of those books that are really complex but yet so simple. It's one of those books that you don't want to put down for a second, one of those books that you read in 5 hours with no break. I really enjoyed it and established a connection with every single one of the characters. I'm really happy i did not read any review or spoiler because I loved the plot twists and the way the characters evolved and changed through the book. Undoubtedly one of my favorite books.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good character plots and great intimacy.  Definitely a must read.  A Vegas trip gone wrong but yet gone very right.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|just flip your devise around idiots<br />if that doesnt work, lock the screen so it wont flip in the first place
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Wonderful story of from rags to riches.  Hanging in when life is hard. Ever After- A Cinderella Story is great.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I did not understand the why this game was so popular untill I played it... so awesome. I can play for hours
0811879542|5.0|Bring this book to any kids birthday party and after the child opens it and people start reading it, all the kids with gather around you. And then all the adults will too! It's so much fun!
B005HSL626|5.0|Awesome game and it is a good way to destress after a long day at work so much fun =)
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am a big fan of Vince Flynn - read just about all his books.  This is his best.<br />Keep them comming Vince.<br /><br />RogerC
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Great action and story telling. I'm a canine handler and have always wondered what it would be like to be able to communicate with my partner. Great concept.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|It takes a download don't waste your time getting it it takes a long time to download it took me 2 days to download it sucks.
145210655X|5.0|We bought this book as gift for a friend and it was a big hit. Humor for the whole family.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|My one year old granddaughter absolutely adored this doll and immediately learned to say a new word - baby!  The doll is just the right size for little hands and her soft body is cuddly and easy to carry around.  She's got a beautiful little face and the removable cap makes for long periods of fun - taking off, putting on.
0843178140|5.0|Have the Mr. Men collection and have started collecting the Little Miss books. My daughter loves them. They are great stories.
B00000IUT7|4.0|Pulls a lot of Brio/Thomas the tank engine cars and that is great.  Would have preferred the engine without the semi-attached tender. Works better for older children who know to turn their toys off when they are done playing with them. You must use a small Phillips Head screwdriver through the funnel on front of the engine in order to access the battery compartment. This gets tiresome if your child leaves the engine on when putting it in the toy box.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have this on my kindle, downloaded it on my sons' tablets, my husband's tablet and more.  I like how I can share books and the free books and apps offered daily.  Definitely better than my original nook purchase : )
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love Lee Child's books, Reacher and, the suspense. I have read them all and can't wait for the next.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I downloaded this for my son, but I began playing it and it definitely entertained me for quite some time.  Some physics, some logic, and some strategy.  Definitely makes you think!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When my daughter loaded this game on my Kindle Fire, I thought well at least she'll have something to do while I work on my computer.  Then, she said, \\"mommy, have you played the game yet?\\".  I tried it that evening and I have become addicted to it, always trying to beat the \\"Santa Guard\\".
075669812X|5.0|If they have Lego Ninjago this book is a must to keep track of all the characters in the collection plus it has a special character.  Got to have it!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|keep up the great work.  I enjoy seeing all of the updates as they are released. I enjoy using this for both personal and professional tasks
B004P95A8E|4.0|A got to have for the Lego Star Wars collection. Cannot go wrong with Lego here! This is a good addition for your collection.
0061452068|3.0|If you're interested in economy more than in evolutionary psicology, steer clear from this book. It's nice and well written, but it is totally centred about the idea of the evolution of the ideas in human mind, and much less than one could expect on the real functioning of the mechanism of today market, trade and prosperity.<br />Ah! I forgot!<br />I won't read any other book of this writer, I'm too much annoyed by the substitution of the pronoum \\"she\\" instead of \\"he\\" in generic sentences
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is a great series with an amazing emsemble cast.  I missed it while i was deplyed during 2003-04.  Unbelievable dialog and believable situations that are really everyday problems.  I can really relate!
B000X2H8G4|3.0|For some reason, this device is good wen using it for conversation, but not for watching TV. My dad can hear people's conversation with this device; however, it makes no difference to improve the sound volume when using it to watch TV. He still cannot hear the TV sound. Disappointing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|She writes this story and u can't help but be drawn in. And throughout the story, u want to cry and laugh, as if u were really there
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This movie, of course, got a lot of hype when it was in theaters; for that reason I avoided it.  I read the book in a day. I should know better to read the book then see the movie as they always lack the details the book allows. However, all in all, I thought the movie was good.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book provided an engaging and well crafted story.  Hard to put down.<br /> Book  3 of the Fifth Shades of Gray Trilogy
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to play solitaire and love playing it on my kindle.  When I click on a card it moves I don't have to continue to click in order to get a card where it is supposed to be. Thanks!!!!
B00APUTEBG|1.0|this movie is slow moving with a poor plot bruce willis gets kiled in the beginning ( I would have too, to be done making this poor movie)
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I t is pretty good but not exciting. I have read most of his books which overall were great but I expected more from him.
B00AEFVRB2|2.0|lots of nudity if you like that sort of thing, Story line ok but the movie has a strange ending.
0345529057|5.0|My son wanted to read these and the books individually were expensive, this was a great find!  He read them in less than a month!
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|The end of the trilogy did not disappoint. Chris Nolan has done it once again. Great movie. I would highly recommend it.
1250000971|3.0|I discovered several flaws in the historical references. Was Miranda Law in effect when Harry was arrested once he arrived in New York? The author writes that Harry was placed in a prison but not in a military prison. As Harry was convicted by a non-military court on charges of desertion, this does not seem an accurate account of any USA military Code of Conduct.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|We didn't have enormous expectations so we were pleasantly pleased. I laughed out loud several times and overall found the simplistic storyline and shallow characters pretty enjoyable.
B005K2YRVG|4.0|This is a good product and does what it is suppose to do for transporting the Kindle reader. It has good seams and fits the device nicely.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|brings you into the mind of a genius, a man unimpressed with his given talents, but wanting to know the world around him..the art world the scientific world and the world of women and socitey
B0043RSK3K|3.0|This has great information that is cited and explained. The chapters are long and the text bounces in and out of chronological order. No page numbers are offered on the Kindle version.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|This is a good read. I liked the western feel to it. I also liked the closure with some of the characters that Abercrombie gives us. However, the story wasn't as tight as his others and seemed to grasping for a closing. Cosca is at his best, but other characters are lacking.
B004SKQAJI|2.0|When I received my product the back cover it was damaged and looks as used item insted as new how is suppost to.
B0073XV2W2|3.0|Definitely not up to the other Suarez books. The other series he did was well written and captivating. This book was well researched, but fell short on the captivating part.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift and it was so hard not to open it myself when it arrived. The packaging is eye catching as well as durable so it should hold up over years of use. Blu-ray is such a nice experience with these classic movies. We haven't made it to the extras yet but there seems to be plenty. I will be adding this to my personal collection sooner than later...  It's that good!
B005LAII62|5.0|Have a good time - watch this movie. If you're into stop action animation, the extras show you how they did it.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Saw this in the theater and knew I had to add it to my own library. I've shown it many times at my work, it gets requested again and again!
B009EANE3M|5.0|The Script's new album is awesome. Love the group. Great album to listen to. Love their songs and the band!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|enjoying this game<br /><br />enjoying this game graphics are pretty good and storyline is interesting pretty good game considering it was free
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Need I say more?? I've been laughing since I started reading it. Her parenting advice is not only funny but relatable. I've definitely spent forty minutes looking for diaper cream! I will recommend this book to everyone I know.
B005D4YHA2|5.0|These sandals appear to be really well made and are nicely finished.  They are the most comfortable and sure-footed sandals I've ever owned.  The sizing is perfect.  I love them!
B00APUQRPC|2.0|Hackney'd script. I like Eastwood but this grouchy old man routine is wearing thin. Very formulaic. Very predictable. Watch the trailer and you've seen the only parts of the movie worth watching.
B005URRCUY|3.0|Great Songs just poor sound and it doesn't matter if played in a different CD player sound doesn't get any better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was so great because it was something different.  Most stories with a female lead are all about gooey romance and sex. This story shows a powerful female with a will to survive that takes charge. Romance is only a part of the story. It was refreshing to read something different from everything else in the mainstream.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I gave this book a five star rating because I loved the thrill of reading this book, the plot, and Shepard's writing style. I recommend this book for teens who like mystery, scandals, and a good read.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Love it but definitely needs to get coins faster and drop prizes of different colors more often but it's really fun
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Its a very fun game. The app is great. It doesn't freeze which is great. You can use it when your bored
B002MQYOFW|5.0|ONCE I STARTED READING I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN! GREAT STORY, GREAT CHARACTERS. I AM GOING TO START BOOK 2 !
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|It was great! It was the creepiest most fun game I've ever played. If you like slender man, you need this app
B003L0V758|1.0|I bought into the hype as I was trying to expand my musical horizons instead of always listening to your typical r&b music. I thought this would be good to try but I was wrong. In my opinion, she doesn't have a good singing voice. I also found it hard to find songs that I could &#34;sing along&#34; too. This album seems like its just all over the place. I tried to like it by listening to it multiple times, and with each go-round I disliked it more and more until I finally just took it off my iPod.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I liked this book. It wasn't as good as I expected, but it was still a nice book. Definitely used the word incidentally a lot.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I love reading this at Christmas time to help me remember the true meaning of Christmas! Such an inspiring story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is too real. The emotions and the opinions are so raw. It's refreshing and a heart-gut beauty. This is not the first and certainly won't be the last time I read this amazing book.
0757302661|5.0|This book helped me to achieve a natural and unmedicated birth of my first and only child. I read this book and took a hypnobirthing class; however, I think you can do it with just the book and cd's if you are committed. Marie Mongan explains what is going to happen during birth and educates you so that you are proactive instead of reactive during labor & delivery. While I was in labor all I wanted was to hear Marie Mongan's voice since I had trained to relax to her soothing relaxation CD.<br />If natural/unmedicated birth is something you want to achieve I highly recommend getting this book early on in your pregnancy. You will allow yourself enough time to learn and practice the techniques in the book and you should be successful.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This book is amazing! It made me fall in love with love itself. Reading for a second time was a hundred times more enjoyable. If you're looking for the \\"perfect\\" love story, this is it.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I generally read non fiction, but decided to read this classic. So very glad that I did. Read it in two days and couldn't put it down. Great story great plot. Great attention to detail! Loved it !
B001OGWY1W|5.0|If you liked Batman begins you should like this one. I enjoyed the movie very very much. A must see
B005MMJ84K|4.0|so confusing with all the then's & now parts. after all its a very good book with a stupid ending. Julian should just die
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Great for family viewing.  A &#34;must see&#34; every year.  A long-standing family tradition that needed upgraded from VHS to Blue-ray.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|I did not think that the movie would be this good. Making the world war II era as the background of the movie, made me think that the tech of special effects for this movie would be minimum, but I was mistaken. I like the story line, the choice of actors and the smooth transition to become the first avenger. We must have this DVD as part of our super heroes collection.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|This Trilogy will keep you on edge!!! Once you get past the first couple of chapters it is hard to put down, It was recommended by a couple of friends. Make sure and read in order to follow the story line. I like get even stories and this is one of the best I have read in several years.
030758836X|3.0|Read in one day so very good word writing but ending just seems like those movies that run out of funding and so have quick silly ending tacked on. Another reviewer said author got stuck towards end and it shows. It will keep your interest so give it 3 stars.
B005K17RU0|5.0|i love this app. it has everything you possibly need to know. anyone can use it. i highly recommend this app.
0375869026|4.0|I ordered this book for my 10 year old son for Christmas, as it was recommended by a literary catalog. Neither he nor I have read it yet, but it showed up in good condition, and on time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could go on for pages about this book, but I won't.  The important thing is that you should buy it.  You should read it.  Colleen Hoover is truly talented and skillfully handled both the romance and the serious issues in the book.  I adored it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I know that people have degraded this book because of its rated r content. However, people need not to focus on that. It has a touching love story. One that goes through more hurdles in less than one year than most in a lifetime.
B000SEI230|5.0|This is such a touching book with many morals.<br /> It reaches out and pulls the reader in. I never wanted to put the book down.<br />Nicholas Sparks has done it again, making my opinion of him being the best author even stronger.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Sometimes the predictive text is very accurate and makes things quick and easy. Sometimes it suggests and auto completes things that I don't want and I either end up making a fool of myself when I don't catch it, or I waiste more time than i saved going back and fixing all the mistakes.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|With the exception of the CD she did with Elvis Costello, this is the worst Krall album yet. The selection of music was very poor. Diana does a lot better when she sticks with the standards or at least songs where can exercise her fine voice and piano talents.<br /><br />I listened to it once and don't plan on listening again. It was a gift so guess I will just shelve it.
B00295UBTO|4.0|This truly is a collection of &#34;Unfinished Tales&#34; from the early times of middle earth. Going even further than the reaches of the Silmarillion. This book contains many great stories, some complete, and some abrubtly incomplete. You will hear of Tuor and Veronwe' only to leave off at the height of the tale. You will here of the Isle of Numinore and is great ( and perhaps not so great) kings. The rise and fall of the Eldar and the hidden city. You will hear the tragic story of Turin (this is the complete story by the way. So if you read it here, you can skip reading Children of Hurin, it is the exact same tale). You will be enchanted by the story of Beren and Luthien, and mourn with Nimrodel.<br /><br />Only get into this book if you know what you are getting into. As I said, some of the stories are incomplete. The timeline is not linear... as some of the stories are not told in a historical order.<br /><br />Do get into this book if you love Tolkien's works and his world and have an unquenchable thirst for more of his wonderful and sometimes dark imagination.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is very enjoyable. It not only is fun the different levels are all challenging. I would recommend it for all ages.
B00973902K|5.0|Great Song!!!!!! This was downloaded again from I Tunes and it came very quickly without any issues at all.  Will download again
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a book I could not stop reading. I amazed myself by reading it in four days. The characters and themes were encouragingly superb, King at his finest, this book had excitement, heart, and soul, and holds the reader in it's grasp. Pick it up and don't let go!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I work with \\"at risk youth\\" of all ages. One of the hardest struggles we face is the emphasis on education, more particularly, on reading. This series has \\"hooked\\" my kids! I only give it four stars because dependent on the young reader, the fighting can get a bit scary, but Rick riordan does an excellent job of bringing humor into the mix. I have kids as young as 7 in my book club, up to age 16, and all of them can't wait till the next reading session to find out what each page will bring!
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book, totally sexy. Couldn't put it down, better than 50 shades of grey! Would recommend it to all of the girls! LOVE
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a fantastic look into a teenage life.  Trying to figure out life is something all teens do.  Definitely a great gift
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|she and I play it together on our down time. before she goes to school she asks me to &quot;check on my babies for me&quot;
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book! I didn't really think it was a book for me due to my age. This is for the young and old and i can't wait to see the movie. I love how Charlie made thing's seem so real and how honest his was. It always takes me a while to finish a book but i couldn't put this one down. If i could give more then 5 stars i would.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My son introduced me to this game and i'm glad he did. It is fun and addicting that you don't want to put it down.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Fun match 3 game with hidden object levels added. But... not worth the $5 asking price. The &quot;history lessons&quot; as far as I'm concerned are unnecessary.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's free. It's really fun to play. The cards snap and move with ease. Great game. What's not to love?
0525953728|4.0|It was exciting to read about the Navy Seals.  I couldn't put the book down once I started reading it.
0393061310|3.0|Dealer was great, but this book is boring.  I thought it was going to be more interesting when a friend mentioned it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very good read could not put it down it was good from the beginning to end over all very imaginative story.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I'm always on the lookout for a new, good mystery/whodoneit writer.  I heard a good comment about this book so I decided to try it.<br />WOW....This author is on the same level as Sandford, Connelly and Patterson.  From the first page I couldn't wait to read the next.  Was so taken with the characters and the plot that I not only went to the American movie but also rented the European version.  Both well worth the time to see.<br />I'm anxiously awaiting the release of &#34;The girl who played with fire.&#34; movie.<br />Have already read all three books in the trilogy.  The only thing I can say is that each book is better than the last.  What a sad loss that Stieg Larrsson has passed away.<br />I've heard that he either completed a fourth book, are was very close to completing it.  There may be some publishing rights controversy.  Hope they can be overcome.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book is good and is nothing compared to the movie. I think I was disappointed with the movie. The book is way better.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|It's the best text editor I have found, but I can't seem to find \\"save as\\" or \\"export\\" to change a file type. Also if I leave a document open an let the kimdle fall a sleep, when i get back to it, it takes a good 2 or 3 seconds for the text to catch up to my typing.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is great. Nothing like I have ever read before. I would really recommend it to all my friends.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|Like the others a really good read. Find myself trying to fit together the characters and time line to the Rain Wild and Liveship books. Interesting to do but not important to enjoyment of the book!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Enjoyed Chris's blunt honesty and insight into the world of SEALS! Thanks for your service and your part in our fight to maintain freedom!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a real page turner for me. Can't wait to read Mockingjay! Thanks Suzanne Collins
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a lovely little tool. That I use when I need it to do some math... So it saves me from embarrassing myself when something should be easy but is not.
0385333846|4.0|Slaughterhouse 5 is supposedly an antiwar book. Instead it is a creative tale juxtaposing the war experiences of the main character, Billy Pilgrim, with other events in his life, most notably his kidnapping by space aliens. Pilgrim is weak character who drifts though life, moving back and forth in time and space, sometimes on Earth, sometimes on an alien planet. Time didn't flow in one direction for Billy Pilgrim. As the book progresses, Pilgrim sometimes lives in his future, at others goes back to his past.<br /><br />I thought Slaughterhouse 5 was an engrossing read and enjoyed it quite a bit. This is not the kind of book I would normally pick up, and I'm glad I didn't read it in high school, because I would have hated it then. It's a bit more profane and graphic than I prefer, but that didn't take away from the story. This is a good science fiction story and worth giving a try.
B008CPZNL6|2.0|I use Flipboard everyday on multiple devices and love it. Now they've screwed up unis version.  I could adapt to the new format -- don't have a choice, since the phone style gives me blank pages.  What I can't handle are the ads OVER THE TEXT. Goodbye.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I didn't start watching WD until just this month and am absolutely fascinated with the show.  I would recommend this to any fan of End of the World, Zombie shows... Great drama, great story line..
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a wonderful series and enjoyed watching every one of them.  Great instant download and everyone should watch it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Can not put it down.  It is too exciting and interesting for words.  The surprise ending make it a mustread/
160059672X|5.0|I really love this book.  It has beautiful jewelry to make and is one of the very best for embroidery jewelry.  I would recommend it to any one.  Great shipping.
B007712XAU|5.0|Everything--the acting, the scenery, the costumes, the storyline--was superb. I can't wait for Season 3 on TV.  Will probably but the Disc when it is over.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, but was a little disappointed with the content.  Downloaded with no problem onto my Kindle.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|loved this game it was awesome.. worth the price. hope they make more like this. looking forward to a 2nd game based on this
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an excellent book & I'm so mad at myself for not getting with it sooner!! Can't wait to start the next one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It was epic I can play with people easy!<br />It's worth it I loved that you can craft unlike in the life version.but there both really.good ans fun
0374214913|4.0|I don't know if I remember where I heard about this one, but when I did, I remember the source recommending the audio version, so...that's what I got. And I was glad I did. I read really fast, and there are some books that I get more out of when I listen to them (for reference: all of Terry Pratchett, I didn't care for his work until I listened to a book, and then I was hooked).<br /><br />Books, bookstores, fonts, Google, history, mystery, secret societies, geeks, programmers...oh my.<br /><br />I know some of the reviews I've read didn't care for the style and tense of the narration, but it worked for me, especially, I think, because I was listening to it. I don't know how some of it looked on the page, where it wasn't clear if Clay was actually saying, or just thinking something, but in audio, especially with the style of the reader, I loved it, it added to the tone of the book, which was I felt was sort of fairy-tale-ish.<br /><br />Some of the characters were a little one-dimensional, but sometimes fairy tale characters are that way. I was rooting for Clay and his friends all the way, and look forward to reading more from this author!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A very simple story told in a simple way. Yet, however simple the story, it was very entertaining and a fun read. While my heart ached a few times, there was never any doubt that Conner and Megan would figure things out in the end... after all, it was a love story! A great read if you want something that is not too deep, that is uplifting, and just an overall easy read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|With the Country of Panem throwing up their arms in revolt, Katniss is trying her best to convince President Snow that she has not played the star struck lover card to start the rebellion. She and Peeta Travel the districts, making an attempt to show the world that they are truly in love, and unintentionally adding fuel to the fire of the rebellion. This is a great second book to the series. You see Katniss struggle to put the games in her past. To sort out the feelings she had to act out during the games with Peeta for their survival, and for the confusing attentions of her once best friend and now possible mate.  She has to deal with all of this while trying to survive the threats of the President and to settle down a upraising that she had no real intention to create.  I don't want to ruin the rest, but lets just say poor Katniss and Peeta will once again be fighting for their lives In more ways than one!  A must read for anyone that read the Hunger games, this is a sequel that for once didn't mess up the original story. Good Job!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|\\"Django Unchained\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Django is a slave whose brutal history with his former owners lands him face-to-face with German-born bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Schultz is on the trail of the murderous Brittle brothers, and only Django can lead him to his bounty. The unorthodox Schultz acquires Django with a promise to free him upon the capture of the Brittles -- dead or alive. Success leads Schultz to free Django, though the two men choose not to go their separate ways. Instead, Schultz seeks out the South's most wanted criminals with Django by his side. Honing vital hunting skills, Django remains focused on one goal: finding and rescuing Broomhilda, the wife he lost to the slave trade long ago. Django and Schultz's search ultimately leads them to Calvin Candie, the proprietor of \\"Candyland,\\" an infamous plantation. Exploring the compound under false pretenses, Django and Schultz arouse the suspicion of Stephen, Candie's trusted house slave. Their moves are marked, and a treacherous organization closes in on them. If Django and Schultz are to escape with Broomhilda, they must choose between independence and solidarity, between sacrifice and survival...<br /><br />The cast led by Jamie Foxx (great as Django), Christoph Waltz (Oscar-winning superb as Dr. King Schultz), Leonardo DiCarpio (achieving villainy excellence as Calvin Candie), Kerry Washington (as Broomhilda) & Samuel L. Jackson (as Stephen) is brilliant. The directing & story & (Oscar-winning) screenplay by Quentin Tarantino is brilliant.<br /><br />The cinematography by Robert Richardson is brilliant. The film editing by Fred Raskin is brilliant. The casting by Victoria Thomas is brilliant. The production design by J. Michael Riva is brilliant. The art direction by Page Buckner, David F. Klassen, Mara LePere-Schloop & Suzan Wexler is brilliant. The set decoration by Leslie A. Pope, set dressings by Antonio Andraus, Chris Britt, Carl Denooyer, Ryan Martin Dwyer, David Ladish, Vincent F. LeBlanc Jr., Sidney Joseph Montz III, Erik Polczwartek, Terri Rainha, Durel Yates & Paul 'Eel' Anderson is brilliant. The costume design by Sharen Davis is brilliant. The special effects make-up designed by Gregory Nicotero & Howard Berger is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by John McLeod is brilliant. The visual effects coordinated by Sheila Giroux, Rachel Faith Hanson & Tom Rubendall, supervised by Greg Steele is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Jeffrey J. Dashnaw & fights coordinated by J.J. Perry is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a well-made, well-acted film that is brilliant and entertaining. Jamie Foxx & Christoph Waltz make a great on-screen team together, and their scenes together and with Leonardo DiCaprio are superbly well-done. This is definitely one of Quentin Tarantino's best films ever. This is also one of the best films of the holiday season and of the year. This is also a film that should definitely has and already has awards consideration, written all over it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the conclusion of the Hunger Games Series and it sums up everything very well.  Katniss is now the ofifical face of the rebellion. District Twelve was destroyed by the President, Peeta has been taken captive, and Katniss her other family members Gale and the rest of the refugees are all in a now rediscovered District Thirteen.  Very different than their own home, and run by a unsympathetic President Coin. Katniss is face with an overwhelming depression, pressure to be a figure head of a rebellion she didn't mean to start, and a player once again in a different kind of Game. Watch how Katniss gets herself out of her depressed state and takes control of her own fate and the fate of Panem. With unexpected twists and turns, and heart warming and heart shattering moments, this is a great conclusion to a wonderful series. Will not Disappoint!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have a blast playing this on our Kindle Fire and will continue to do so. I just loaded it yesterday and am on level 47 already! It's a ball collecting prises and trying to solve the jigsaw puzzle. You gotta at least try this one out. One time and you'll be hooked!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just re-read this great series.  For those of you who have seen the movie but did not read the books, you are in for a really great surprise. The book is well written with descriptions of people and places that give you a full view of the world you are reading about.  The premise is a corrupt country that use to be the United States but is now &#34;Panem&#34; a country dived into thirteen different sections (the thirteenth area was destroyed in the upraising...that's all i'll say)  and then the capital.  Because of an upraising that occurred seventy years previously, a boy and girl child from the age of 13-18 are picked at random to compete to the death in the Hunger Games. Look through the eyes of Katniss, a sixteen year old girl who volunteers for her sister at the annual Hunger Games reaping. See how she is thrown on into the games and into the world and starts a revolution, although she doesn't  mean to. It is a compelling read that makes you stay up way past your bed time to see what happens next. With a beginning of one of the most complicated love triangles ever witnessed, you will find yourself wondering what you would do in her situation.  To be honest I don't really think it is appropriate for children under the age of 13. I believe that the social markings of the people and the questions of love and taking a life  go above and beyond the whole &#34;young Adult&#34; spectrum. This is a great book, that was made into a not so great movie. So if you liked the movie, you will love the book, and if you love the book, skip the movie! Hope this helps!
B0070YDOT8|5.0|This is totally realistic and allot of fun to play without losing real money! It's also GREAT practice for the real thing! Vegas look out....I'm coming to count cards again!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book immediately captures the reader and doesn't let go. I just finished it and it still won't let go of me. What a wonderful book.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This brings back memories of the &#34;Old Days&#34; when video games (arcade machines) first came out. It's a pleasure to play and show my grandchildren what it was like when we saw the introduction of video games in my day/youth.
B0049CVUNG|4.0|Every recent performance of Les Miserables has at least one thing that ruins it.  In this case it's Nick Jonas as Marius.  What were they thinking?  He's so below the standard set by everyone else in the cast, it's laughable.  He's really, really bad.  Other than that, it's an excellent performance.  This will never replace the definitive 10th anniversary performance, but it's still worth it for the excellent video/audio quality.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is the second series my grandson and I have  enjoyed together. We both can't wait until The House of Hades comes out in the Fall of 2013. This book starts out slow and picks up speed. Good book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Each season just keeps getting better, and better.  I want them to go on forever.  The time period and the actors are just spectactular.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is an app you can get addicted to quickly! If you like a challenge this is the game for you! Or even you just want something to do this your game.
B0026P3G12|5.0|There is a mix of CD music.  I wish she would have made a CD with just Christmas music.  She has included Christmas into a regular CD line of music.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howie is a really talented writer--managing to engage the reader on many levels--the unique dystopian world of the silo, the many characters on the various floors, the mystery of how it all happened.  I love this kind of novel, and I think he gives The Hunger Games a run for its money.  I'll always like the books better, but Hollywood: pay attention!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My grandson has this and I like to play on his Hook.  And when I got my Kindle I wanted it too so I will enjoy it. And it was free. Free makes a difference.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|cant get enough! highly recommend this game. I remember playing this game in Jr high on the old school Pc, and this is exactly what I imagined the game should be like when I was young
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have played once and really like it.  I look forward to playing whedn I have time at the office.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Other than the first book in the series, which I did not fully understand after reading, but did later on as I read,the story flowed very well. It kept me wanting to know, to know who survived and how. It was great right to the end.  Thanks for great adventure.
075669812X|5.0|Grandson loves to read and he loves this book.  And the extra little lego was encluded.  He was surprised and loves to look up all the people.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best series ever! I couldn't put it down...if sleep wasn't needed I would start the third book right now. Amazing
B004I744AS|3.0|I have troubler spelling sometimes and needed this for my Kindle.  I am also learning how to use my Kendle.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This was a pretty awesome book it gave details and it talked about Greg a lot more than the other books. Also it was different but in a good way. I liked it a  lot and pictured what was going on the whole time. Thanks.
B000784WMW|3.0|It was entertaining but not worth buying.  I like time peaces and enjoy the costumes and household furnishings.  Would rather see on PBS.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app WAS awesome. at firsts. then it just got stuck on retrieving news feed. After about 2 Days of use it wouldnt load my messages. And it would always stop responding and force close. THIS APP SUCKS.
B001PU8N0I|3.0|I would have wanted to rent it rather to buy it.  Once seen, I would not repeat a viewing. it was ok.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love it! But we need to be able to do what the Xbox adition does like railroad and stuff like that
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Not overly great, but good.  To see on PBS would have been better rather than buying it.  I would only watch it once.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The first and second season just keeps getting better.  Brilliant actors and story line and seans.  The house is one I would love to tour.
B004SBX112|5.0|It's fun to see the Angry Birds in different seasons, it's a lot of fun to play Angry Birds while snow is falling and scary music is playing.  I would totally recommend this app to other Angry Bird fans.
B006I1OB0U|5.0|What can one say about thios marvelous production of a period piece.  The actors, the seans, the story line is just marvelous in every way. Jillian Fellows had made a fabulous series.  It is like peanuts, can't get enough and wanting mord.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Free and fun, what could be better?  I enjoy playing Angry Birds on PS3 so I had to have this app for my Kindle, it's a nice mini version.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie has quickly become my favorite movie. Its the perfect combination of a comedy, drama with some great music thrown in.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is so addicting!  I love it.  I was familiar with this game from playing it at the arcade and I'm so happy to be able to enjoy it on my Kindle.  I  passed the time away while I waited for my husband to come out of a store the other day.  It's so much fun for FREE!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|IS AT FIRST GLANCE A QUALITY PRODUCT, COMPLETE IN ITS SEGMENT, WITH A GOOD PRICE FOR ITS PERFORMANCE AND QUALITYONLY THAT I WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT THE ENTRY OF THE PLUGS WOULD BE BACK FOR NOT HAVING TO SEE SO MANY CABLES ON MY TABLE, BY THE OTHER WELL.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|Angry Birds is fun, so I've been downloading everything Angry Birds, but the Space Angry Birds is quite different.  I don't find it as much fun as the other Angry Bird apps.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Love this movie. My 5 year old loves it. Great Gift!!! It is funny but also had a serious side.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|This third movie in the series changes from the dynamics of the first two that targets the child and adult audiences mutually and shifts toward targeting the 10-15 year old sector. Many of the actors are hip hop stars and the dialogue is very &#34;teeny bopper&#34; in nature. Queen Latifah, Ray, and Dennis Leary manage to keep it at a tolerable level and it does have some very clever and cute parts.
B002FGU3X6|4.0|I bought these sandals without really seeing them and they fit, they are durable, they are a fine pair of sandals.
0061120081|5.0|This is my favorite book and I wanted a nice copy to give to my niece as an Xmas gift. The cover is gorgeous!
B000JRYOPG|1.0|The movie was tired i dont know wether it was the sound or picture quality but nothing kept me wanting to watch
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Easy read, makes you want to read the others. Also a good intro into the raunchy novel world. On to the next!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I found this book on amazon.com when I was looking for a new good romance to read.  I saw that this got 5 stars and figured I would give it a whirl.  I like some romance but it has to have a good story, not just hot steamy sex.  This book has just about everything I was looking for:<br /><br />1) Outstanding character development.  You will love these characters and genuinely get swept up in their story.<br />2) Raw emotion.  I felt as if I was living Sky's world.  The author does a phenomenal job of feeling everything that these characters feel. You can really understand and feel the connection between Sky and Holder.<br />3) A plot that has some mystery and makes you want to keep reading.  I had my suspicions regarding the mysteries surrounding Holder's character.  The author threw me for a loop a couple of times which I thoroughly enjoyed.  It wasn't as predictable as I thought it might be. And, the pace of this book is just right.  It doesn't feel rushed or boring.<br /><br />This book definitely deserves 5 stars. I will definitely be reading other books from this author.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the whole series. Had gotten away from reading for quite. Some time. The Hunger Games was recommended by my friends & family. The books are a not want to put down page turner. Thrilling & unexpected turns. I highly recommend all 3 books.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a terrific app! Lets you know how much battery life you have left for various functions and can also be set to alert you when your battery level drops to a certain point. I highly recommend this :)
145210655X|4.0|Cute book with nice illustrations. Some of the jokes were really funny while others were so-so. Don't have to be a Star Wars fan to enjoy this book but it does help :)
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This is a good read for a weekend or beach trip.  Can't wait for number 3 to come out!  Hot and steamy!
0307946711|5.0|ONE DAY is not your typical romance novel and readers who don't like surprises will not enjoy it. It is a very realistic love story that is dark and gritty at times. It will make you laugh, cry and ponder about life and missed opportunities. It's one of those books where the characters still linger long after you've finished reading their story.<br /><br />Nicholls' unique concept of revisiting the flawed yet endearing Emma and Dex on the same day every year is beautifully crafted in this novel. When I wasn't laughing at their witty banters my heart was breaking because the characters still had a lot of growing up to do and messy situations to clean up. The ending was unexpected but still satisfying (to me at least).
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book was a great adventure read over my extended Christmas holiday.  If you like Clancy, this is a great one.
B003V5CTH8|5.0|This box is so cool. It contains really special things regarding the movie including a stocking shaped like Elf's shoes. I love it. This item in for when you want to give more than just the movie to someone who adores this film.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|My grandkids like to play this but I am a little bored with it.  Not enough action and is really kind of boring.
B0061Q13V2|4.0|I found this book very interesting because I remember watching Dominique Moceanu in the Olympics when I was around her age and thinking that she looked like she probably had the perfect life. After reading this book, however, it is amazing to find out what was really going on behind the scenes in her life that most people had no idea about. It just goes to show that you never really know what goes on behind closed doors...
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|And this game is no exception.  Very challenging.  Have managed to get all of the way through the game and will now go again and see if I can make better scores.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I normally don't like singing movies, but this one was really funny!  Even our teenage son liked it as well.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app. Very useful and convenient ,fun and does the job without a lot of fuss.  Good deal for the price.
B006FK7SZ4|1.0|beware of reviews that sound like infomercial testimonials lol. badoo prob hired ppl ir just made a bot. bad sign for the app.
0920668364|5.0|We had this book for my kids 17 years ago, and now we bought it for our grandson..my older ones remember it as one of there favorite book growing up
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've loved John Grisham's legal thrillers for years.  However, some of his more recent books were disappointing.  But this one was exciting, great characterization, and kept me guessing to the end.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|it is great for on the go trips and it keeps me occupied when I'm bored. I would deffinatley get this app if I were you!!!!!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Kept me entertained from the first page to the last... Covered a lot of areas that you wouldn't generally think about in a zombie book... Was a excellent read.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|I already own the CD of For Emma, Forever Ago, so I knew how perfect it would sound on vinyl. His ethereal voice pairs wonderfully with the warm crackle of the vinyl. I'm fairly certain that Bon Iver was born for vinyl records. If you are going to buy an artist's record, Bon Iver is a purchase you won't regret.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so good. It was a journey through a very heartbreaking experience but Colleen told the story so well! She brought all the pieces together beautifully. Definitely a book hard to put down and a book that definitely deserves 5 stars!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved it!! The story is unique and entertaining. Scenes are detailed and beautiful, creepy and fun. You can choose the difficulty level that suits you, and hints are available. There is a great mix of hidden object scenes, puzzles and games amid a great storyline. Kudos to the developer!!! I highly recommend this game.
B00A7OIXW6|1.0|IT WOULD BE GREAT EXCEPT I WANT IT FOR MY NEPHEWS (AGES 6 &5) IN MEXICO AND IT IS NOT IN SPANISH LANGUAGE ALONG WITH OTHER MOVIES I WANTED FOR THEM. I AM THERE SURRAGATE FATHER AND TEND TO SPOIL THEM A LITTLE SO WHEN THE NEW MOVIES ARE MADE IN SPANISH LANGUAGE I WILL BUY THEM SORRY DISNEY BUT YOU BLEW IT THIS TIME.[[ASIN:B00A83075M Wreck It Ralph]]
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Very repetitive, twilight with no vampires or wolves replaced by whips and cuffs. Okay story but not very well written. Curious to see how the movie turns out.
B001GWK2MC|1.0|Made very cheap think China people.<br />Buy American and save this country and our jobs.<br />Well this bounce toy lasted all of 3 days tearing at the doorway seam.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great! Its not like the other games that hardly give u any coins.... it has plenty of coins and games!!! Some of the games are boring and slightly on the hard side, but most of them are REALLY fun!
B005DOKM9M|4.0|I chose it just as a cover to keep the screen from scratches and debris.It does a fine job for that. For added protection I would get a hard cover to protect it from hard falls or something heavy falling on it. Does a fine job for the reason that i got it for. Seems to be well made and fits product very good. I would definitely tell someone to buy one for the money.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A dance with dragons may not be as good as books 1-3 in the series but this was a good book that I really enjoyed. The book starts out rather slowly but really starts to pick up towards the end. I can hardly wait to see how the story unfolds in the winds of winter.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|once again people, this is no Christian Grey! Gideon Cross and Eva Tramell have me in a spell. I can't wait in the next book and the fourth if needs be, because their story needs nurturing and time.<br /><br />stop comparing the book to fifty shades ... as none of these books are the same, only similar plots from time to time. read this book in less than 24 hours and I loved it!<br /><br />it's full of so much twist and turns how can you not?<br /><br />I am patiently waiting for book 3.<br /><br />gonna set an alarm :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Finally! A calculator that's not ridiculously complicated or unhelpfully simple, but one that is &quot;just right!&quot;  It allows me to do the calculations I need without having to do separate calculations, then write down the results, so I can then add them back into a separate calculation, or is so complicated, most of my time is spent trying to figure out how to use it! Love the way it tracks previous calculations along the bottom of the window, and that I can exit the app to look up some other financial info, come back and it's still right there where I left off in my number crunching. I use it daily and it never disappoints!
B005HHSXP0|5.0|Percy is back. that is all! The return of Percy is spectacular, he seems even more powerful and the 2new demigods are very powerful 2
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a must read. I couldn't sit it down. Very very very very very good. I enjoyed it.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I enjoyed this game on my Nook and now I am enjoying it on my Kindle. Hidden object fun and a great rebellious daughter story line.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This was just as good if not better than the 1st one. I loved it!!! It has all the stars that I grew up watching.<br />I would love to see a 3rd one come out. I would watch this again! Awesome movie!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is one of my favorite books now it is awesome and you need to read it thanks for reading this review
0307591549|5.0|Written with humor, science and understanding. Makes you laugh and strengthens one resolve to keep moving forward in a positive light. Share and pay it forward.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the most amazing book I have ever read twice actually. It took me a day to read it I couldn't put it down!!! This is a must read!I'm ready for the movie!!
1419705849|5.0|My sons love this series and so do I.  We have so much fun reading it in bed.  They are such quick reads, though.  I wish they would last longer or that I could find other series that my kids enjoy as much.
B003K16P3M|1.0|Very good. When I first started reading it I thought it was going to be boring. Bot it wasn't. I loved it
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|A little different from the other Pendergast books. I enjoyed this one. It left me hanging and looking forward to the next book in the story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book so much!! It is a inspiring love story, with a tragic twist. Thank you John Green, for warming my heart.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game! as always! graphics are good and game is easy to follow. loved the story line! Got stuck for a min. in the managers office. the key is in the book on the desk,  just flip through the pages.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is a winner!  It's writing and acting are superb. There's subltley, humor, pathos , ...human interactions well thought out and always having the historical events of the times as an underlying theme.  I've liked many BBC series, and this one is very, very enjoyable.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie was delivered by Santa and we've already watched it a few times!!  Fabulous story and incredible graphics - Anne Hathaway is an amazing Catwoman as well!
B00A77II0U|5.0|I play a lot of these type games and in my opinion, THIS one is one of the best apps I have played on my Kindle.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The storyline makes this movie, but what really shines are the characters, expertly played by a wonderful cast.  We've already ordered Thor and Ironman to catch up on the background - and can't wait for 2014 when the next Avengers is due out!
0307895475|5.0|i ordered this for my husband when i bought him the game and he loved it. it had everything that he wanted.
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|Barbie does a wonderful job with wedding gowns - and Bella's simple satin gown comes to life in this lovely doll.  Can't have a Twilight Barbie collection without Bella dressed in white!
B008XNZMOU|4.0|I like this cd but it is not the country sounds I am used to. It is about half country and half watered-down pop you hear on the radio. Worth the purchase though!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Splashtop has made it very easy for me to connect to my home computer when I am traveling and to get work done. I use it with my blackberry tablet and love it. I recently got a kindle fire and have downloaded it to that device as well.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|A very nice addition to the Angry Birds Collection.  It does freeze at times with my Motorola Xoom tablet for some reason.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I never played Mahjong before. When I found the Deluxe HD version, I feel challenged and I keep my mind alert.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I first played this game at Kings Island with my friends 14 year old daughter. On a big screen tv, it was awesome!
B002RVZV9U|5.0|Jimmy Page is great! I will rent anything that he and the rest of Led Zepplin are starring in. He is a legend and this movie shows how he got there.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game so far. I like it because I'm getting my moneys worth. I like the various locations. plenty to do. I will reccomend this game to others. cant wait for the sequel.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|This movie has the ability to make me laugh. What is called comedy today is sometimes nothing more than vulgar! It doesn't have to resort to having a candy bar mistaken for poop in the swimming pool. Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn play perfecctly off each other. I love it! Every time I watch it. I have watched it butcherd by TV to fit the commercials now I have my own DVD so I can watch it in its full glory!
B00A757EFW|3.0|I thought I was getting good until I hit the 2nd stage, then find out that I have to buy more in order to play more!  Not good!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The more acorns you get the more easy'er the game gets. And the more stars you get the higher level you go and you better you get at the game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this version on my Kindle.  It's very user friendly.  I can take notes, highlight, cross reference and get many different translations.  I wish it was available in a non online version.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|really enjoyed this game...finished it in one sitting :) cant wait for the next...maybe a little less scavenger hunts would be nice
B008S4YZCO|3.0|cant visit Random ranches so cant complete all goals or get alot of friend hearts. crystals are too rare and or expensive so progress is slow. its cute but wish I could do more faster without money
B00542USJW|5.0|Having your grandkids overnight? A must have for fun and entertainment and they never get tired of watching Michael Jordan. I love how kids and adults become engrossed in watching this movie and both are clearly enjoying it! A fun and funny movie!
B00846REIS|3.0|There is way To much back and forth, fighting and making up. Very 20 shades of grey, but still somewhat entertaining.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|A nice movie for a guy to watch by himself when its girls night out. I like it a lot. This has a simple plot and is very exciting. Lots of action and enough story for me. No one talking about their feelings and how much diaries mean to the,m and no dudes shirtless washing dishes. Guy and cool girl movie!
B004LROUNG|1.0|I can't really rate this book at this time, because I just started reading it.  However I have loved every book that I have read by John Grisham.  He writes the type of books I enjoy.
075669812X|5.0|It comes with a Ninjago character and a very nice and detailed hardcover book. Very colorful and tons of pages and photos of the kids favorite Legos
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is the best book I read and I'm in the beginning !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!! !!!! !!!! !!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The best app i have used for the Bible. I only wish they still supported the NASB for audio reading.
B007TML4EI|2.0|this game is ok for the first 10 levels but then it gets very very very boring so I don't really think this is a good game
B002WY65VU|5.0|This movie is one of the best Zombie movies in the short history of Zombie movies. The only negative thing I don't like about this movie is the part where Bill Murray gets shot, I think it would have been funnier if they would had left him alive and alone in the film.
B0055Q5F36|1.0|Had to return it the same day.  Does not fit the Samsung Galaxy SII for US Cellular. Too loose and not very snug.
B002SR2PKG|2.0|the begging of the book was pretty good. but the rest was just not at all good. but i will say that my favorite boook by stephen king is insomnia.
B005LAIISA|5.0|As evidenced by my 3 boys' obsession with this movie (they've watched it at least 5 times in as many days), it's a winner!!  The humor is quite good and I think each movie in the &#34;Ice Age&#34; series gets better and better.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Awesome series! ! !  Love love love love love totally by the whole series if you can, great great great
B008JGSM6G|5.0|lots of levels and lots of fun. great casual game. not a lot of spammy ads. several hours of fun.
B009K0P10K|4.0|Revenge season 2 was very interesting and Amazon made it available to watch it without commercial interference. I recommend amazon for its price and availability.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I really thought there was a lot more character development in season one. I will continue to watch season 2 and I hope the episodes get better. I did see some improvement from the first few episodes.
B009IQ0TGM|2.0|With an amazing voice like hers and the ability to make quality musical decisions, not to mention the access to top of the line production value that she has, this could have been brilliant. It comes across strained and muddled, instead.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I received this from a friend for Christmas. I thoroughly enjoyed the story from start to finish. I like to find authors that have a series I can follow and have enjoyed Kennedy and Brown for mysteries and thrillers. I definitely will be reading more Connelly. I'm off to find the first Bosch.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kept my interest throughout. It got better and better until the terrific end. The end really surprised me. Well written.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I have had this DVD for over a year and have watched it many many times. I purchased two more for Xmas gifts.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was great:) I will read it again and again for sure,:) this is better than the twilight serious without doubt!!!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is a good book. I am amazed at how long she survived with those people. I hope the best for her and her daughters.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|More than worth the $5 I spent on it! All of the songs were absolutely amazing. You should definitely see this musical!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Excellent! Great story! Look forward to the rest of this series! Highly recommend this book and the rest of the Percy Jackson books!
B009B51K9U|3.0|when I heard about what Green Day was planning for this series of albums I was excited because of what American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown were. When I bought this and listened I felt like there was nothing special about this ablum. It's not a bad album by any means but it just wasn't what I hoped it was.
B000088E6D|5.0|Bought this as a present for my Wife, she likes it,  for me not so much, I am not a fan, won't grumble if it's playing in the background though..  I guess if your a Buble fan you will no doubt like it and good luck to you.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|This is a great murder mystery and does a nice job of introducing high school government students to the American criminal justice system painlessly.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great variety - ever-increasing challenge - different types of Angry Birds.  This game makes time fly!  You will love it!
B008NEVPCC|5.0|I enjoy this product, and it came in a fashionably matter. Nothing is wrong with it what so ever. Thanks!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This Kindle Fire HD 7 inch case is attractive for a variety of age groups.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />The case has a different grooves which allow you to angle the Kindle HD 7\\" for optimum horizontal viewing depending on how you are seated and what you are using this Kindle for.<br /><br />The purple color is stylish without being overally bright or neon.<br /><br />The strap secures the cover to the Kindle HD 7\\" and thereby causes it to power off and save energy when not in use.<br /><br />Nuetral Note: The case only allows for horizontal or \\"landscape\\" viewing, it doesn't have a swivel feature to allow for vertical or portrait viewing but it does not claim to do this.  This note is included in the event you are looking for a dual view option (both vertical and horizontal). If that is the case, you may want to look for a different (and probably more expensive) version.<br /><br />Overall, an attractive, sturdy case that protects the Kindle HD 7\\".
0375507256|3.0|a complex read, gott be ready to really get into it, not a light read at all.  Hopefully I will have more time and silence in the house to really dedicate to this book.
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|It's ok for a Resident Evil flick, Doesn't really relate to the game much but it's got a few things I like: guns, zombies, hot girls, and excellent production quality. Overall, it's just like any other Resident Evil movie.
B006O6F932|3.0|Easy to put together (my 10 year old did it herself), however for the price I expected a better quality product. Very flimsy, top floor of the house is only held up by the ladder.  Folds nicely, however again the ladder gets in the way when folding and my daughter snapped it off although it did snap back on. She likes it and has played with it several times since Christmas.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|No, i dont think i should have had to pay for this app either, but i did. No biggie. Its unlocks the hidden camera function on our kindle hd, i dont really think much of it but my 8 year old thinks is awesome. Wish the kindle would have had a camera on the other side of the device as taking pictures of other people other then yourself is a challenge. In all fairness amazon doesnt advertise the kindle to be designed to function that way but my daughter wanted to be able to do that with her kindle so she does the best she can with it. The app functions well and takes good pictures.
1419705849|5.0|My daughter loved all the other books from Diary of a wimpy kid and this one is another book that she couldn't put down. She read it on Christmas day. She loved it...
B001HN6922|5.0|great movie. great gift.  Don't like the words I used to make sure it's long enough for you?  Is this better?
B005CA4SJW|4.0|I wanted to see The Walking Dead because I had heard so much about it. The series on TV was not in my time frame. It was a great series I jumped a couple of times, I like to watch something that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|Nanny McPhee is enjoyable for the whole family. Nanny teaches the struggling family lessons for a lifetime, with some fun and adventure mixed in.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|I love being to see weather in other states. My kids live in Florida. it is great stuff for an app.!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Incredible cast. Plots and sub plots. And all in an exotic setting. I liked it so much that I gave another copy as a gift.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the start of reading this book I never wanted to put the book down, at the I felt as if I were there and could really visualize what was going on, I can't wait to read the other books.
B005CM1INE|5.0|Loved this movie. It was well directed, acted, and written. Love Stephen King novels and the book was great. Watch
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really loved this book. I didn't think I would but it was fantastic. Two thumbs up ! ! !
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Easy to read.  Fast moving....fun but not a surprise at the ending.  I do recommend it for a quick read
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Bought it with device and find it very useful, but folded tripod could<br />be sturdier as it takes a minute sometimes to get it holding firmly upright.<br />Good value
B007SGM084|2.0|I should not have been shocked because I was aware of the content.  However, it is soft core porn without any real substance.  Could have gone more with a story of love and if the author felt a little perversion was needed, then okay but constant S&M.  Don't let your kids near it
B00A6I87UQ|1.0|I have the kindle reader on my ipad and have purchased books that I can read, this book does not download and I cannot read it. A waste of $9.99.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This was a great book!  It had plenty of excitement and just enough twists to keep you guessing.  I liked it because it is not like most books where you can constantly guess what is going to happen.  It is different and exciting.  I would definitely recommend this book.  It has a small amount of language in it but not as bad as a lot of books these days.  There is word every once in a while, but besides that it is one of my favorites.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|This movie does not disappoint.  A great mix of superheros with great action sequences.  If you see the other movies for each of the avenger characters, you will have a better appreciation for this movie.  I appreciate the side humor in places you don't expect it.  Can't wait for the sequel.
1843106698|5.0|Informative. Helpful. Reliable. My son is eight and recently diagnosed. This gave me a much greater understanding. So many truths about my own son. amazing. Well written. Thank you to the author.
1451696191|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is now one of my favorite books of all time. This book provides the reader with drama, comedy, and everything that you need in a book and then some. The Perks offers a unique writing style based off of its format, and always leaves the reader wanting more. It offers surprise upon surprise upon surprise. Charlie's stories allow anyone from almost any walk of life to take a walk in the shoes of someone who has been neglected by his peers, bullied, and who just generally doesn't fit in; someone who sticks to the outside and watches and understands -- a Wallflower. If you are looking for a fantastic novel that will grab your attention and take you to another place, look no further. Chbosky's novel will have you searching for a box of tissues. If you can't tell already, I think this is an absolutely amazing novel that envelopes the life and hardships of an average highschool who doesn't seem to fit in with his peers.
B005LAIGWS|1.0|I really don't care what your opinion was on the first Ghost Rider movie, but I will say that I enjoyed it. I thought it was badass and had a lot of mass appeal. Here we have Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance...also starring Nicholas Cage...<br /><br />First, this movie is like a half sequel, but it is clearly made by completely different people except Nicholas Cage. Its like a sequel/reboot, so you will be disappointed on that alone. Next, it sucks. It just sucks. Lame plot, lame villains, lame script. Decent special effects.<br /><br />Don't waste your time. I don't even want it for my marvel movie collection. Its just bad.
B0095R64AO|1.0|dont watch itff ffffff f f f f f f f f  fff f  ff f f ff  ff f
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I love Christian Bale as an actor, he is a wonderful Batman, and I just loved the whole movie.  I am looking forward to watching the The Dark Knight Rises!!
B000022TSH|5.0|I like almost everything Jack Nicholson does.  I'm not a Faye Dunaway fan, but she plays her role well.  John Huston is great in his role, a despicable one at that.
0205313426|4.0|This book is a great reference. I use it often when writing. It can be read cover to cover, but after that you will use it as a reference.
0767827902|4.0|Good flick from years ago.  Re-viewing it was fun.  Loved Ben Johnson.  Sheperd and Bottoms also good.  Cloris Leachman shows her wide versatility.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As usual, fast-paced, hitting current and relevant issues...where does he get his info?  Makes it easy to understand spying in a wireless world and how it could affect every one of us.
B00364K6YW|1.0|It is missing a huge portion of the movie. It's a terrible copy. It's my favorite version, I know it well. This is a shame.
B007SSEU9O|3.0|Lots of back ground of her life.  Not much focus on what she did and how it was received.  I would not recommend.  Acting was very good however.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|This was like ordering \\"A Year in Provence\\" and finding 90% of the book taking place in Mexico. The story was fair and at least it was free so I can't complain too much.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Liked this story.  Good for kids and family with a good moral outcome.  Good for girls because it is a story about how girls can be as strong minded as boys.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I bought one for myself and one for a gift! All the songs are wonderful and unique. Every piano player should have one!
B004XNGKBS|5.0|This app works good, and is very useful when taking notes. I am using it with a stylus which I find works much better then just using your finger.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is Awesome! Doesn't matter what she sings, her voice is totally HOT! My favorite song is rolling in the deep, of which a classical version was made on The Piano Guys hit CD, as well as a sound track on the James Bond movie; Sky Fall.
076781214X|5.0|I bought this movie for a Christmas gift. It arrived on time and no beating the price. Always a good gift.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I bought one for myself and one for a gift! Every song on it is truly great!<br />What a voice!
0307352145|4.0|Everyone should read this book.  We are all not alike!  &#34;Quiet&#34; points out many differences between quiet and talkative people and how schools and educators do not recognize these
1607066017|5.0|Brian K Vaughan and Fiona Staples in the collected 6 issues of SAGA found in this trade create an expansive and interesting world filled with crazy characters and a thrilling story. The artwork is simply beautiful, Staples makes your entry into this world as easy as possible while conveying a world filled with wonders. Brian K Vaughan as far as I can tell decided to write Star Wars one day and then realized that Star Wars already existed so instead he created his own unique universe filled with amazing characters. Now I'm not saying this is just Vaughan telling a Star Wars story, no, this is Vaughan creating a story of lover's on the run that in just 6 issues rivals the epic tale that is the original trilogy. I loved it. Can't recomend it highly enough. I would happily hand this book to anyone over the age of 12 interested in comics and just good stories.
B00846REIS|5.0|5 stars, best book I've read since Fifty Shades of Gray! Can't wait to read the next book of the series
B009UX2YAC|5.0|all it is, is just a modern temple run but it is more fun cause u get to jump on top of things and u have better characters to choose from and lots of cool daily missions and regular missions.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I have a brand new kindle fire with no books on it and this game said there was not enough storage space for it...how big did u guys make it?? My kid was super disappointed, he loves ice age.
B006O6F932|3.0|I was really surprised and the poor quality if this house. Very flimsy plastic. We were expecting more sturdy house for the money. Thankfully my daughter likes it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|It is way better than game in phone my 3 year old is great at this game, thinks he loves it even more than angry birds!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The Angry Birds Free graphics are so much better on the Kindle Fire HD then on my smart phone.  Better, clearer graphics on the larger screen make the game more enjoyable to play.
B009YX02T8|5.0|Even if you don't like the movies... or get the books...  listen to the soundtracks.  You'll understand what the feelings are about!
B004EK926K|5.0|Great job bringing this classic tale to life.  We will make this movie part of our holiday routine, and tell our friends to do the same.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|Naomi Watts looks so beautiful in this movie . By the time it was over I loved her as much as Kong did. Several scenes only show her magnificent face. There are 2 scenes where she and Kong are mesmerized by the incredible beauty around them. She tells Kong \\" beautiful\\" and she is trying to get his attention. Even Peter King's magical movie making can't top her smile. I felt sorry for Kong because as hard as he tried he just couldn't keep her.<br /> I saw this movie on the big screen and it was a thrilling spectacle from start to finish. The expressions on Kong's face will make you feel empathy for him. The island is like a world no one has ever seen. This movie is by far Peter Jackson's greatest. Even Spielberg would be jealous after watching this movie.
B009PAETCG|2.0|I have to pay to go one anything but normal it's terable  I don't like this I should have gave it a one star
B008LD09LS|5.0|The app downloaded easily to my Droid X. Connecting to the drone's wi-fi was also easy. I test flew it in my kitchen. It took off and hovered about 3 feet from the ground awaiting further instructions from me. It is rock solid stable and if I can fly it the first time out, anybody can. I haven't taken any pictures yet. I'm waiting for the snow to melt so I can take it outside and get some aerial shots of my property. Very happy so far.
B009LY72LQ|5.0|My daughters love these sets. They get creative and mix and match parts. There aren't enough pieces to make two dolls but that wasn't an issue for us. My kids like having a variety to switch up the pieces. My 3 year old has no problem getting the pieces in and out, but my 10 year old needs help, sometimes. The only thing I wish was that the pieces came in some sort of case. They were all over in an instant and I made the girls put them in a Ziploc. A nice carrying case would be ideal. The dolls are a slightly lesser quality than the regulars but they have different parts, such as the tail on the cat or the fin legs on the sea monster.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Dat Hair!<br /><br />The hair in this movie give the main character a whole new dimension, something I've never seen in an animation. The is the only one using the technology which helps bring the focus in on it. It has a life of it's own. The physics of it are phenomenal. Every step, bounce, and nod is noticed. Oh yeah, the movie had a good story too.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|wonderful...faithful to history... the actors are consummate in their craft...one feels the past come alive, and what an important  part of the past!.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|First off, I love the soundtrack for the Hobbit.  This version of the album has some extended and exclusive songs that were quite fun.  I love the singing ones, and Howard Shore did a wonderful job as always!
0345803507|1.0|I really didn't care for the first book, but I sort of wanted to know what happened next, so I bought the second book.<br /><br />I didn't think much of the second book either, but I decided I might as well figure out how this series wraps up as not, so I bought the third book.<br /><br />And yes, I might as well not have read it.<br /><br />Anyone looking for serious character development in any of these protagonists will come up sorely lacking, so I don't have much to say about this usually fascinating aspect of a given book. I suppose the character of Christian experiences a sort of character arc, and maybe Ana does too, but frankly, I wasn't impressed. I also wasn't impressed with the supposedly erotic nature of the book. Episodes in these books certainly are provocative, but not at all sensual, and I found myself irritatedly skipping most of those parts in search of something, anything, to latch onto in the characters.<br /><br />I think I am most impressed at the British author's description of stateside Seattle.<br /><br />Silly fad series. Save your money.
B006G2ZEV6|1.0|The game is unplayable as no text shows up on any of the menus, controls, or text boxes. Please fix this issue and I'll gladly update my review. Disappointing that the game is sold in such a state. It clearly was not tested on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9''.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|not enough time to view.. :( ... . . . . ... .. . .... ... ... ... ... ..
B00001QEE9|5.0|This is a great movie to watch. Totally captivating. Stupendous condition for the price.  Definitely would recommend to everyone who has never seen a classic Disney movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing read, finished in a day.  Beautiful story about love, friendship and willpower.<br />A must read for any age limit
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an amazing close to a very exciting, powerful, and suspenseful trilogy. I read all 3 over the course of 5 days. Couldn't put them down. WOW.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the suspense. Can't wait to read the next one. Love my Amazon Prime membership. Free books and free movies.
B003719G40|4.0|This book is good if you need to revitalize thoughtfulness in your marriage. There is an interesting questionnaire at the end to help you and your spouse discover your Love Language.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Much like his other works of literary art, I was eagerly enticed from the start. John Green has a perfect way of balancing the need to capture your interest, and keeping it as the plot thickens and you're sent into a maze of spiraling emotions. I feel connected to these characters; as if John documented a year in their lives and then wrote about it. I'd love to see these characters brought to life, but at the same time I don't want to see this seamlessly perfect book fall victim to bad screenplay. Maybe John can direct a movie for it himself. Keep on doing what you do best, kind sir. Okay.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Loved this book till almost the very end. I was swept up in the story until the island of lemurs.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|one of the preferred movies at home full of details for a better coexistence all over the world and to learn how take care of our planet
B008JGSM6G|4.0|enjoyable! another thinking game that seems simple at first blush but takes a bit more consideration as you go along. love the bright colors!
0689835604|2.0|Only a few pages. Kind of a waste of money. Not much point to buying this product as after three seconds you are finished reading it to your child.
0547884591|5.0|I picked up this book, knowing full well that Tim'd deliver.  Having read his two other books, I knew this one would be killer.  His lessons allow any novice chef to acquire the skills to vary and improvise with any ingredients they have on hand.  Thankfully, he makes a point that learning anything does have its physical limitations, and with the colossal content in this book, there's still plenty for me to digest.<br /><br />I bought this book for the meta-learning section, and it was wonderful.  Thing is - it worms its way into all of the other sections.<br /><br />Most importantly, his style of writing embodies spirit of a good-humored man who is willing to take on a challenge; and this is a skill in itself, worthy of cultivation.  Kudos, Tim - the book's kickass!
0671449028|5.0|This book is great! My grandson loves it. Great little story with lots of color and many pictures. Will definitely buy again for gift.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|all the funny parts are really on the preview making this movie seem a lot funnier than it really is.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Excellent service and the product is great. The product was actually what I wanted and I will shop again with yu.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|As stated above, I haven't watched this movie.  I love Margaret Thatcher and the clips I have seen of Meryl Streep portraying that role have been perfect.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I enjoy having the weather at my fingertips. I need to know what I may encounter as I travel and the weather channel is always very accurate.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|cool story line graphics pretty good.  wasn't long enough for me though finished it in about two hours. I would definitely recommend
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This product is great. I would not shop anywhere else for the Kindle app because Amazon stands behind their products and that is the main reason I shop at Amazon first.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Mike explained everything in a very simple and easy to understand manner that can benefit anyone from a beginner to a seasoned pro, best investment I have made in a while. Thanks, Mike
B009VB97EY|3.0|Giving 3 stars because I got to see the film free after I purchased a copy for my aunt.  The surprise in this film is how serious it gets.  As a whole, Magic Mike falls short of &#34;magical&#34;.  There are many places the movie could've gone to make it really shine.  In order to roll with the pitfalls and darksides which come with after hours work, one needs to care about the characters involved.  None are fleshed out enough for you too.  A watchable movie but not stellar.  If you're just looking to stare at 6 pack abs and see some butt, this is for you!  Otherwise prepare for a little heartache.
B00942S4OY|5.0|My granddaughter wanted it for Christmas, and she loves it...plays it all the time!  One Direction is her favorite group!
B003YTPS7O|4.0|For those who love both romance and wine you will love this movie. Russel Crowe is fantastic as is Albert Finney.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was a marvelous, suspenseful love story!! I definitely recommend reading this book to anyone who wants to understand what  true, honest love really is.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Awesome book, pride in all who have served this great nation!! Thanks for keeping this country safe, God Bless You
B007VUA7VO|4.0|The different colors for the battery at SO MUCH FUN! I like how immediately after I plug I'm my charger, this app shows the percentage of the battery life. (But the different colors are still my favorite trait!)
B0012QRPU4|5.0|When I first read about the premiere episode of &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; in the media, my wife and I made sure we saw the beginning. We were hooked from the first segment. It has the kind of drama and tension that makes you regret the end of each week's showing. It has consistently improved each season. Walt and Jesse are complicated and the best of partners and adversaries to each other.<br /><br />What a great show! When I have exposed other people to the show, they all thank me for the recommendation. Cannot be patient for the next one to begin.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|wi ll ki ll ho urs of ti me and yo ur bat tery good for kids and adults me and my girl friend both have the app on our kindle and phones
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book, can't wait until the third one is released I have already pre purchased it, steamy and romantic give it a shot and better written than 50 shades in my opinion
B00846REIS|4.0|After reading fifty shades, it's a good take off since I couldn't put it down. There are some circumstances that are the same but it's still a good read. Over all I like it and can't wait to read the third book. Cheers to Sylvia Day!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I love this series, great show,  wonderful acting ,  cant wait for the next season, it is so exciting !
B002MQYOFW|4.0|After watching the movie first. I wish I had read the book first because of the details that are not brought out as much. Recommend this book
B00999DFP0|5.0|My DVD's arrived in the time frame they promised and the videos work great! Would recommend this company to others.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|ANOTHER JOHN COREY MYSTRY THAT YOU HATE TO PUT DOWN TILL FINISH IT.  I WOULD RECOMEND THIS AND OTHER NELSON DEMILLE BOOKS TO ANY ONNE THAT LIKES A WELL WRITTEN STORY
B00136NVH4|5.0|I know it dates back a long way, but the stories told in the great tunes are timeless.  I love the two bonus tracks on this download as well.  Rockin!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Lately when I've been playing, the game either froze up or didn't accept my correct e-mail. It's getting annoying because I really like this game,but if I can't play it, then...I'm unhappy. The same situation occurs with my sister and her iPad. I would not recommend owning this game for a long time.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Very unpredictable, funny entertaining. Was glued to TV. Can't wait to watch season 2 and all the rest of the seasons.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was a great book......but it needed a better ending or a big twist before it ended..... otherwise it was a great book
B00062PN6I|5.0|I'm a transcriptionist, so I need a headset I can wear all day. This one is super comfortable. Even though it is big, it is very light. The cups cover the ear fully and muffle ambient sound. Incoming sound is crystal clear. Very pleased with these, and they were inexpensive to boot!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Was such an amazing book! I recommend it to people who like romantic teen comedies. Colleen Hoover is an amazing author.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I am glad I read this book because it was a great thrill ride and I told my friends about it and they loved it to.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book was great and I loved it! It does have a few intense scenes being described but is written in a mature way. This would definitely be a good book to more mature audiences that would understand the content. Some people said that this book focused too much on the cats, but I think it is very believable in her condition. She was in a lonely place and that was probably what kept her happy. She even said that herself. This book would definitely be a book I would recommend.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of pi a great book filled with many twists and turns and a great symbolic story of the hard times pi has at sea. You will not want to put the book down until it's done.
B00170MYIS|5.0|This is my second battery (replacement and spare) and both were under $5 each s&h.  Wife loves having the spare because she can take more pictures!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is very fun and suitable for a wide range of ages.  I know people from age 6 to age 60 that enjoy it.  I typically hate video games and do not waste my time with them.  This one is nice because I can play when I am waiting for something and just spend a few minutes, but it is engaging enough that I like to play longer when I have the time.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Great author  began a little slow but made up for it in the end  always a good read with connelly
B006PAZMMK|5.0|First Skrillex album i bought, others i would mainly just listen to on youtube. It was well worth the money, a good mix of in your face songs as well as his more ambient tracks.
0307341550|5.0|I read Gone Girl first and then turned to this; Dark Places is awaiting me on my Kindle. What I loved about this author is her ability to create characters that are brilliantly unusual, damaged, and twisted and who still feel very real. I connected fully with the narrator and appreciated a mystery that did not offer a bland, cookie-cutter reporter/cop/what-have-you, and intsead featured a complex and dark heroine. In fact, I've been turned off thrillers and mysteries because so many of the characters come across as flat. Not so with this author; she has reignited my interest in this genre! The book also had the appropriate level of creepiness without being unnecessarily gory. Love her prose, too!
B002VX3RCW|5.0|My 3 month old got it for Christmas and loves it.  The colors are great and he enjoys grabbing the rings on the tail and the crinkly feet.  We also got the soft cloth book that goes with it and he loves both of them.
0446580848|5.0|Gives background on Yemen while weaving a thrilling story that even contains humor.  Love DeMille.  This is one of his best.  Probably my second favorite of all his books - the fist being \\"Charm School\\".  Buy now and begin the journey.  You wont regret it.
0525953728|5.0|Mr. Owen did a great job with this book. From the minute I started reading I was hooked and could not put the book down. It would appear Mr. Owen found a way to give us an inside view of how this event unfolded, including  a view of SEAL team life, without disclosing information that hadn't already been disclosed by the news services or other sources.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Grandpa and I both put this game on our Kindles and the grandkids love that it interacted with each other.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just finished reading the third book in the Fifty Shades Trilogy and I'm ready for the next book from E. L. James.  These books really leave you wanting much, much more.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading. I would attempt to put it down at the end of a chapter but I couldn't be left hanging. On to #3.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Always liked card games and this one is just perfect! Great to have on my cellular and KINDLE Fire! If you like card games...you'll like this one.
1457514508|4.0|In a cleverly twisted plot, there are 4 possible victims, and yet only one suspect, so far.  With an eye for lush imagery and a tongue in cheek sense of the absurdities of suburban living, the satire is intermingled throughout the story, aiding in the reader's enjoyment of the characters and the plots that are set against them.<br /><br />With distrust and suspicion, friendships and romantic entanglements are revealed, and are slowly unravelling as the plot thickens, with several twists that were unique and very reminiscent of playing the game of Clue as a child.  Thoroughly entertaining, the pacing improves as the book moves on to a conclusion that certainly leaves room open for one, or more, murders.<br /><br />I received an eBook copy from the author for purpose of honest review during my Indies Rock promotion on I am, Indeed.  I was not compensated for this review, and all conclusions are my own responsibility.
0525953728|5.0|I loved the book and am glad the author had the balls to go against orders to write this story so the world would know how this story REALLY took place!
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|I initially didn't care for this series, but I've bought every season since season 1 for my wife. I however am a big fan of this series now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book you don't expect the ending,and you fall in love with these characters  as you get to know them and their tale!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|It is not as user friendly as I would like, but it is a good choice for a kindle !
B008KE3960|5.0|This is a very time consuming game. Fun for the young and old children in your life! Get it now! Worth every penny!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Works Great!  I love have this app.  I check it a few times a day.  Simple and easy to use!
B009B50QOU|3.0|I like the drum sound. It's that old school Green Say same beat every song scheme, but it works. The bass rules, and the backing vocals rule. I couldn't help but laugh at the lyrics. Some of them are just plain childish, and others are so cliche you'll want to face palm.<br /><br />I recommend sticking with everything before 21 guns.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Grandkids love it!  The 3 year old loves to get the bombs,which is not the object.  But he laughs and laughs!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I don't need beats. I really enjoy using these headphones for home listening and for monitors for recording at home.<br />However, and I was ignorant to this before I bought it, the cord is very long. That was my fault for not researching. Can't easily use these while walking around. Not a big deal. The sound is superb for a fair price.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this was a fun little game to play on the tablets i got my neice and nephew. they really enjoy it
B00APUYWYA|2.0|I just did not care for the puke and vomit. Just did not add anything to the story. The music was the movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Someone has to pay for &quot;free&quot; apps.  Everyone is pretty hard on this app because of the ads but it is just at the beginning of the game and easy to close out.  This is a great app otherwise.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|Great Book, Looking forward to reading the next one. The short stories are good as well. Hope you enjoy it too.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I was mesmerized by this book! I love reading about why we do what we do, and this book brought to light the most interesting research into motivation that I have read. As a manager for many years, I was always looking for ways to motivate my staff, and learning why they acted the way they did, and what motivated them led me to read much on this subject. This was the best book I have ever read on the subject.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|What can I say.. This has got to be the best series on TV.  I re watch and find new things each time.  These guys are a real trip together.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This is a gripping, page-turner! Baldacci is always good. I read everything he writes and have never been disappointed. Buy this one.
072325804X|5.0|Original illustrations by Potter.  great for kids bedtime... colorful animal characters.. timeless... for a gift or home ! ! !
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book really was inspiring. The authors really did a great job at helping me find a deeper meaning to this story, and feel the feel feelings of \\"Charlie\\" himself. I can't wait to see the movie!
0723257639|5.0|Great set.  In a box and sealed.  Stories for kids and original Potter art.  great animal stories ! ! !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it this book was  amazing and I can't wait to read two--- then the third one. Thank  to prime
B003OETK32|5.0|This album has some better choices of music after comparing to others.  This was a gift for a Boyle fan.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|I can understand the no beginning, as the movie is a continuation of the Bourne saga.  But, it has no ending, the movie just ends.  the bad guys are still after him.  I was watching the chase scene at the end of the movie, they got away and as they were on a boat the movie ends.
B00008YJH5|5.0|Love the Where Is My Mind cut used in the Fight Club movie credits.  But the album is all good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can do like any thing.You can  mine craft and build.<br />You can play with friends and fight them. Also you can fight monsters.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie is an amazing view of our history; The sets, cars, wardrobe, music, lifestyle and social events of the time.  Thoroughly entertaining with hair obsessed Clooney in the lead.  Soggy Bottom Boys music the best.
0345525558|5.0|A very moving piece of literature covering life, love and the &#34;ties that bind&#34;. The use of floral interpretations makes you reconsider the next bunch of flowers that you purchase ! Heart- warming and heart wrenching !
030758836X|2.0|What a shame that a good story idea is rather poorly written. The two main characters (husband/wife) read like the same person and not developed well. I just don't understand the HYPE on this book.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Kids loved and it was everything I expected. the item came before Christmas, it was a perfect stocking stuffer for them.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|There was great humor and the girls definitely added to the movie.  They were adorable. Looking forward to seeing #2 in the theatre.
1401322786|5.0|An easy read that is thought provoking.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed playing with my thoughts around the concept of time (Chronos time [clock time] vs Kairos time [God's time], and Ecclesiastes 3:11.) I enjoy different interpretations from different genres on their take on time, infinity and eternity. This story does that.  There are two ideas worth contemplating in this tale about endless time and hope.  It's not just a love story but also one about lettng go of selfish motives.<br /><br />I recommend it.
B008M36EEI|4.0|The story is good for the inspirational type of movie to keep on trying the impossible. It is a feel good movie.
0345803507|5.0|Absolutely could not put this book down..one of the most enjoyable stories that I've read in awhile..a must read for the romantic...
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I always like playing freecell in my free time. It always entertains my mind and keeps my mind thinking and plotting.
0345803493|5.0|As with the two other books, I couldn't put this one down..I totally enjoyed the Fifty Shades trilogy!!!! Romantic and sexy!!!
B0053JJLLC|4.0|I like Michael Crichton stories of science technologies and the down side that technology can take when used for evil means by villains.
B00A23MYCC|1.0|The story line was good, but I found the language  vaguer.  Because of the teddy bear young kids would think it OK to watch
0060839872|5.0|Great book. I read it when I was in college and got it for my friend's son who's a motorcycle mechanic.
1439127700|5.0|At age 60 I thought i would remember most of the historical content of this book, but imwasvsomwtong! This book, whick forbthe most part didn't take &#34;sides&#34; was well written and an eye opening account of how the most exclusive club in the world operates, or should operate. Well worth the time to read!
1401235417|5.0|I would definitely recommend this product! As a long time comic book fan who has been absent for many years coming back to comics, I wanted to get into the New 52 line but the individual titles are hard to come by (and expensive). This beautiful trade collects issues #1-#7 and includes the variant covers. Scott Snyder's story arch is intriguing and Greg Capullo illustrates the action very well.It's a great entry to the New 52 series and definitely a must read ! This was an awesome Birthday gift and I cannot wait to get Vol. 2 !!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game.  The cards move smoothly and I like the game layout.  Overall it is an enjoyable game!
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I fell in love with this series, now I am addicted! Seriously, it is worth watching!  And it is not only just for \\"Vampire Lovers\\" it's for everyone!
B00004W221|5.0|Passing this movie and great all time story on to my young grandson.  Glad it is on DVD. To give as a gift
B001FB4W0C|5.0|My purchase was a Xmas gift for someone else.We enjoy this series.Above the normal production quality for a TV series.<br />I would recommend to any x-files fan to try this one also.
B008WCP2KG|3.0|I'll admit, I bought it for the eye candy and was glad I wasn't expecting anything more out of it. Good for a pick-me-up on a cold winters' night.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Fun to watch.Good acting with high quality production.Recommend to all,very fun.If you like/liked the x-files you'll like this series.<br />You won't be dissappointed.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|I thought the actors did a good job relating feelings that we all go through when we wonder why a relationship fails.  The manner in which the movie goes forward and back in time was interesting, too.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|Was very informative an  really broke the agreement  down nicely to be easily understood I highly recommend.<br />Just to fill review lol
B008133MDK|5.0|I found this by accident, but am I glad I did!  This is such a great modern interpretation on the old classic.  It's smartly written and acted.  By far, probably the best series I've seen, and I cannot wait for season 3 to be filmed!
B0015DROBO|4.0|I definitely enjoyed this book.....it was very intellectual and mind provoking. I would love to know Lisbeth Salander's past and the origin for her antisocial demeanour. The movie gave the book no justice.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Really fun game but it is P2Play. I just let it sit there building energy. Not worth dropping extra cash into in my opinion.
0446343129|5.0|This book is an easy read. It documents, historically, the evolution of the blight we know as processed sugar. I read this book and then cleaned out my kitchen cabinets. I lost 30 pounds in three months, and felt a lot better. That is, after going through about a two week withdrawal period.. The only problem with this book is that you must take all of its advice and actually drop &#34;ALL&#34; processed sugar from your diet. You'll be glad you did. Trust me on this one.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|I would not have watched this if my daughter hadn't asked if we could watch the trailer. I was hooked. I love the way the story is told. The characters are developed well enough to make you really care what happens. The script was fresh and had enough little surprises to keep me on my toes. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who misses a great story being told instead of disconnected special effects.
1451695195|5.0|We all vacillate on the belief monitor in our lives from one to ten. At least I think that is for most of us. It's always based on our human life experiences. I listened to Dr. Alexander being interviewed by Dennis Prager on the radio. I had read the article he wrote in Newsweek. Because of his background as a neuro Surgeon at Harvard I had to figure a 2nd generation surgeon was dead solid serious in his perception of what happened to him in the 'brain dead' state of his coma. This was not a fundementalist layman who attributed God to making every discision in his life. Had he fell off a tractor while farming I doubt (no reflection on farmers) that his story would have reached Newsweek. As he said he doubted he would have believed a colleague with the same story.<br /><br />I don't know that he offers proof of heaven but he offers up the possibility of a heaven that I like to believe in. He tells you over and over that he doesn't have the vocabulary to even describe his experience but he does it in grand detail in my opinion. I had trouble putting in down. The book is written with a lot of medical reasons 'why' and why not these experiences could not just 'happen'.  I'm sure this will not give many skeptics a reason to do anymore that claim him crazy or at best delusional from the illness. For those of us that live with doubt and are open minded I think the book does offer you an explanation on why he now believes, even if it's just in the idea that belief is possible. Faith seems to be a gift that some have and some don't. Short of a personal experience, I get the idea that Dr. Alexander was not on the fast track to become a believer! Unfortunately most of us will not experience that type of conversion but it's a nice way to spend a few hours with someone who has had a life changing experience that we may never have. It filled in a few blanks for me.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use a lot of social media and this really helps me keep my different projects coordinated. I like that it crosses over easily on different devices.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Music is certainly in the ear of the listener so telling someone you will like music is like telling someone you will like a certain food because everyone else says so. Easy enough to see; go listen to the sample tracks before you order. I loved it as I did the old Led Zeppelin, the old Moody Blues, the old Pink Floyd. I like  the CD and also sent it to a fellow music friend who liked it. I hear a little of a lot of earlier groups in their style. Well produced and I have a huge sound system and I play it loud! This is not background music!
141659521X|5.0|Always been a fan of Vince Flynn, as has my Father. Always can count on another great book every year - especially right before Christmas!!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Music was good, Rebel Wilson was hilarious.  I would definitely recommend this one as a good entertaining movie and the acapella groups are quite fun
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Easily installed. Directions were easy to follow. I still don't understand how it works, but it does. And it's free.
B002PZC8BM|4.0|Very entertaining. As long as you can believe the premise of a police &#34;consultant&#34;, watching Jane do his thing is lots of fun. The episodes are well thought out and fun to watch.
B0056C6XIA|5.0|Frank had searched online for this multitool, came home told me to check Amazon because he knew it would be less expensive and he was right! Once again Amazon proved to be the place to find exactly what we were looking and at a great price! So I got it for  him for Christmas and he LOVES it!<br />May God bless!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I found hopeless wonderfully written. I picked the five star rating because it was well written, I cried over the raw emotion of this book and the characters were well developed. However, I do think the ending went a little faster than it should have and the sex scenes seemed a little too vocal to me. That's a lot of raw emotion for eighteen year olds. Other than those two minor details,  loved it. The plot just kept getting thicker and thicker. Intense. I would suggest people 17 to 23 to read it people over that may find it a bit unrealistic.
B000007XUQ|5.0|I  enjoy this cd of Christmas.  It is a mix of old, new, and classical songs by one of the most beautiful voices of an amazing woman struggling with Anorexia.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|I loved the dancing the music and the HOT lead Ryan WOW all the dancers were amazing I can't wait for the next one(:
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Listen.... ignore this rating read the series but in my opinion the third book was a let down for an outstanding series of books.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good quick read. Keeps you gurssing what the deal is until about halfway, but then you want to see how it all ties together. Enjoyed it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book. Loved the series...well 3rd book was a let down but the whole of the series was excellent. I see this being required reading for 8-12 graders eventually as the topics covered are important.
B00ABKGG0C|3.0|I'm highly suspicious of how this novel rates so many 5-star ratings, if I'm being honest.  To me, it was a decently written novel, without any glaring editor errors or major problems like many e-books these days.  However, it was also not anything overly special or fantastic, and I have a tough time believing that so many people thought it was.  But there you go.<br /><br />I've read a great many fantasy novels in my day, and this one is somewhere in the middle - 3 Stars.  It's largely a coming-of-age tale and this type of thing has been done often (and better) by other authors.  The story is decent, but not exceptionally compelling, and by the end I kind of just wanted to get the book finished.<br /><br />The novel's overall story arc is of a boy who trains to become a warrior, but after a long period documenting his initial training (which was the most interesting part of the book) large gaps in time follow, jumping to later points in his life and subsequent chapters focus on specific battles or elements in the larger story.  To me, the problem was that I didn't really become engaged and \\"want to know what was going to happen next\\", and in the few instances where I was getting into the book, some long time-gap would then occur and pull me out of the story.<br /><br />I assume this is the first novel in a larger story, but I don't think I'll be purchasing the subsequent books.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this is a book that's just perfect not only for kids but for adults as well.<br /><br />the book is well written and easy to understand.<br /><br />it also presents parts of the story through viewpoints of different characters. while some \\"scenes\\" would be told by at least two characters, the reader is given the chance to see what might have happened through another's perspective and this in no way made the story some kind of a repetition.<br /><br />this is a kids book but could be enjoyed by adults as well.<br /><br />not only that, even adults could learn a thing or two out of the story.<br /><br />just perfect.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|I ordered this for my 9 yrs old son since he enjoyed Goonies.  I have been telling him about 80`s movies and he was so interested in.  Short Circuit was ( is ) one of my favorites as well as my husbands.  My son loved it, too that he watches over and over again.  We might try other 80`s movies.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|brain teasing fun for the whole family to enjoy. We need more games like this one for the Kindle Fire
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Good book<br />Really enjoyed reading it to my children. I felt the book followed the movie very well. Would highly recommend it.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|The book was a good romantic light read.  The plot wasn't very thick, but I took a liking to the characters.  Some of it was unbelieveable - for instance, how the main character, Maggie, actually went along with these guys at the beginning of the story - it was all very suspect to me from the start.  However, I liked the descriptions of French life, the countryside, city, food, and people.  This was by far the believeable part of the book.  I think the author writes well, is very descriptive, and portrays  the characters nicely.  I have just finished the second book in the series and liked that also.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There are no words for the emotion I feel after reading this book.<br /><br />Holder and Sky are..........I just......I can't even express how these characters are able to evoke such raw feelings within me. The push and pull relationship between them is incredible.<br /><br />I love getting started with a book where I'm positive I know what's going to happen and have that s*** thrown back in my face. I was completely blindsided with this at about 64% and it was the best thing that could have happened and right at the perfect time. I kept thinking that this was just another book being hyped up by default and dang-it all if I don't apprieciate being wrong about that on so many levels.<br /><br />I cannot praise HOPELESS enough!<br /><br />I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!<br />Please, read it.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is such a great movie! I must have for any family who loves music! Fun to have it on Bluray too!
B009VB97EY|3.0|Was home sick and had nothing to really watch and didn't want to read so I rented this movie.  Not what I expected.  Thought that some of the scenes just were not what I expected.  Dancing was good though.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|The music was great and the storyline was interesting.I watched it with my granddaughters and we all enjoyed it.PG13 rating but 1 of the girls is 9 and she didn't notice anything but the music!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved Colleen's first books. Slammed and Point of Retreat have been on my top 10 recommended reading list for almost a year now. They were brilliant. But I've got to say, Hopeless was PURE PERFECTION. Colleen managed to debut her career with two awesome books and then grow even more as an author with Hopeless. She was able to take something that is dark and ugly and just heart wrenchingly sad and turn it into something so beautiful and full of love and hope that it brings tears to your eyes. This is not just going on my recommended list, it's a MUST READ!
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game. I play it all the time.  I like the Multics player mode and stuff. yeah sooooo that's all I have to say
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I really liked that it didn't time me on anything I wasn't rushed to find anything or go anywhere...only thing is there is a lot of back and forth to the different locations.  But it had a nice hint button that helped me figure out where I needed to go next and only had a short cool down time when it gave u a vital hint other wise no cool down on showing u where to go.  Good story line a bit confusing at first because it starts with flash backs.  If u want something fun with easy play and more search & find and less puzzles this is it game...there are only about five real puzzles but are fairly easy...hope u enjoy it was over to soon :)
B005FISBTO|5.0|I bought this for my son-in-law for Christmas. It was in great shape and a much better price than in the stores!
B00A757EFW|5.0|i really love this game. my friends & family play all the time. it is easy to follow the instructions.& fun playing the game
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this game has a fun story line, multiple different types of puzzles and games, and good graphics. i do think it was a little pricey for the length but overall a great game
B005WUHAX8|5.0|It was for my girlfriend and she loves it. You have to press on the screen a little bit harder but she got used to it very quick
B003O86FMW|4.0|The writing was excellent and I still found myself being sucked into the story line, but there weren't as many twists and turns or surprising parts to the book. I think this book could have been more drawn out into two books to add more detail, but overall this is a fantastic story. LOVE the characters and ideas are so unique. Can't wait to read the third book. I would recommend this book to someone of any age.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Just finished it was basically her monologues from her show but she is so funny I enjoyed reading it she makes me laugh.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|I choose this rating because everything worked on my computer with all of the episodes.  I also enjoy being able to go back in and watch them at anytime.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Great plots, great actors and great chemistry between the characters. Hope it gets a second season. It is really well written.
1416987118|2.0|I expected the original wording for this preschool classic.  My error for not checking further so just a heads up for anyone else.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book, a fun and quick read that kept me coming back for more! I definitely recommend it to others.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I absolutely love this game, even more with the touch feature available on my tablet and the game itself.  No more sliding cards across or double clicking.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It took be a long time to get into this book.  It was a best seller and had great reviews so I purchased it.  I found the first half of the book to be slow and uninteresting.  The second half picked up a little.  But overall I found the book boring.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|He is an excellent writer.  I love all his books .  Highly recommend this one to anyone especially avid Mitch fans.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|FB does not load.  all u get is the spinning icon.  On the Fire HD you are better off going direct to FB
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'm an aspiring writer, and this helps me to organize my notes. I also like to draw, and to with the possibility of attaching pictures, I can illustrate my notes. I love this app!!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|One of the best Dr. Seuss remakes!  I would recommend this movie to any one!  Great movie for teachers to add to their classroom libraries.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Definitely gets harder at the higher levels, but still not that bad.  Fun for a while, but gets old quicker than some other games.  The kids like the easy levels.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Very fun app.  Entertaining for kids and for adults.  Some levels are pretty challenging.  Glad it was offered as a free app!
B005ES126Y|4.0|These would not be worth it if it wasn't for the free shipping and free returns.  Took multiple tries to get the right size.  As a woman, I did not like these - way too wide.  But my husband definitely liked them once he found the right size (multiple tries).  The sole is very thick and they are very comfortable for him.  They have lasted well so far, and were worth the purchase.<br /><br />Ended up with a Men's size 7 (usually a size 8.5-9).
B0058VW36U|5.0|Kids love this game and so do I!  It is a lot of fun to play.  Can be challenging, yet easy for the kids to play too.
B005VPRETE|3.0|There are other sets that my daughter likes better.  I think that's because this one tends to come apart easier than other sets and isn't as clear how to easily put it back together.  It's still a cute set, but I think there are other Lego Friends sets that are a little better.
B006O6F932|2.0|Came with stickers but no instructions on where to put them.  Playset is very flimsy, doesn't stay together, constantly popping apart during play.  All peices pop apart during play as well.  Not well made.  Pretty unsatisfied.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Loved the movie. Very funny!<br />Good acting and direction. Good story. Must watch in my opinion.<br />The rating is for the movie. But consider going for the HD version if streaming on a big TV.<br />The picture quality bugged me throughout the movie but I still couldn't stop laughing..
0553573403|5.0|The book that started it all... This is the first &#34;fun book&#34; that I have had the opportunity to read in years. Recommended by a friend years earlier, I was really surprised how quickly the story pulled me in. I have never been one for fantasy books, sitcking mainly to military, espionage, history, and the like. GoT was a major game changer for me. At this point, I've read through all the other novels in the series, and I'm currently on A Dance with Dragons. I have never read a series of books so fast. If you like character development and regular twists and turns that make you go, &#34;Whaaaaaaat???&#34;, then this is for you.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would recommend this book as a must read. Such a beautiful story with a whirlwind of emotions that reach to you as you feel like your in the story. Your gonna laugh cry and be in anticipation on what's gonna happen defiantly not expecting what happens next
0307749347|4.0|I really did like the book-great (and useful) information. Better put I'd give the book a 5 stars and the audio program a 3 1/2. I rated the audio as I did because I've seen this author on public television and he is MUCH more animated and personable on TV.<br />I found the author's approach of offering several different practical exercises to see what technique works best for you to be refreshing. Overall this is a very good book and one I've &#34;gifted&#34; to several friends.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Superb and one of the best of the series. Preston and Child make an excellent team. Awaiting their next book with baited breath.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|A classic that the kids really like. As an adult watching the movie again, it is so funny all the little innuendos and such in the writing. This movie, along with Mary Poppins, are favorites at our house.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is a good game to keep you busy for those moments when you need a little entertainment but don't have a lot of time.  Lots of replay value.
B00177YA1K|5.0|Still the best of the bunch.  I managed to buy MBI II and was getting III for Christmas but never did get the original.  Love this movie
B005HSG3VK|5.0|It is nice, holds kindle well and safely.  Does not cover screen at all.  Very sturdy and well made and a good value.
B005LAII62|4.0|I wish I could say I loved the movie but It was alright so i liked it instead. If you want to wait and buy this at a cheaper price then its worth it but i would wait til its cheaper.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Mary Louise Parker was not givin much recognition in the leading roles. She was equally as entertaining as Malkovich ,she was an accent to Willis and I can't imagine the success of this movie without her expressions.Hellen Mirren and Brian Cox were also very good roles.And as in every role that Morgan Freeman plays ,he is terrific<br />The cast as a whole were great . Another reviewer stated too much violence for children ,the news has more violence than this movie and it wasn't blood and guts .Most of the violent scenes were hilariously unbelievable such as shooting the shoulder launch missle ,and batting the grenade with the rifle butt .Great action.<br /><br />I wore my first DVD out,had to order another
B00005JKWJ|5.0|I bought this movie to finish off my collection. It was a good movie and I enjoyed it just as much as the first and the third one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds is the best! Best part is that you can still play Angry Birds with out having to be hooked up to Internet. Love love this game!!
