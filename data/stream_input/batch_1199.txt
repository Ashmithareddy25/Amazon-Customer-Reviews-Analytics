B000FCKGPC|2.0|I started with the first book and got hooked by the setting, although the constant shifting from one character to another became annoying.  I read the second and third, although the series became depressing (with everyone dying almost) and the alternate chapters of characters becoming more annoying as it became increasingly difficult to remember where the story left off with each succeeding character.  The third book actually became rather boring but I ordered the fourth book anyway as some of the characters were interesting enough  to want to find out what happens, although the slaughter of Robb and Catelyn was truly depressing.  Finally, half way through the fourth I gave up and quit reading as I really didn't care what happened to the characters anymore and the individual plots were more and more diverging.  I felt like George R R Martin seemed to have lost the thread of the original premise of his series and was just extending the plots to make more books.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|Great mellow cd. A whole different level for Eddie. I love this cd. I'm a fan of Pearl Jam but have to really listen to make out the words. Not the case with this solo/duet album.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|We have only just finished the first disc, but as usual Breaking Bad is fantastic.  I don't want to give anything away but if you are a fan you will love it.
0553801473|4.0|Before I bought AFFC and ADWD, I read review after review on Amazon that said both books were slow, boring, nothing happens, why didn't GRRM have a better editor, etc --so I started to read both books prepared for disappointment. And it didn't happen.<br /><br />I got into the series thanks to the HBO series (which is wonderful to watch a second time once you have read deeply into the series), so I read books one through five from June through August. If you read them one after another, there is a noticeable slowdown in the action in AFFC and ADWD, which to me, seems natural given the progression of the plot. Everything in these two books is setting up for the last two books, when winter comes and the ultimate battle takes place between the Others and human kind, when Daenerys Targaryen takes her dragons over to Westeros and reclaims the Iron Throne (so I hope!).<br /><br />There are times when the lists of names gets a bit too long, but I skim it. Still, I've skimmed way less in these books than I have in others where description goes to the point of madness. GRRM is wonderful at character development, and you get a rich sense of all the characters in these books, especially ADWD. No one is purely good, or purely evil, just as they are in life.<br /><br />I dont want to add any spoilers, but I still felt there were a lot of plot twists and surprises in the book as well. In any case, perhaps I would be angrier if I had waited years and years for books 4 and 5 -- but when you can pick up one and read it right after the next, it's just more time you spend in this incredible world that GRRM has created.
B000051VWW|5.0|I have been an admitted hip hop and alternative listener for my 34 years. In recent years I have begun to lean towards other genres. I am very glad my SECOND listened to from beginning to end was Sade Lover Rock (The first was D'Angelo Brown Sugar, I dated a girl who had that damn disc on repeat ALL THE TIME) But anyway back to my R&B breakthrough and realization that not all R&B was whiny popish garbage. Any time I am having a bad day or feeling some kind of way (yes guys do as well ladies LOL) I throw this on and just let her voice take me away. I recommend this for anyone who just needs to relax. Her voice is so soothing it can put you to sleep. I kicked myself after listening to this CD and immediately tracked doen her entire discography. I only hope I can one day see her LIVE with someone who I care about deeply. (yes again ladies men have romantic thoughts LOL!) Well enough rambling, if you want a good...no scratch that if you want an experience in your music I HIGHLY suggest you try ANY Sade CD they are all good. Have a good day.

0002051850|4.0|So after I bought the book, I was watching Pawn Stars and freaking george stephanopoulos was about to buy the book when him and rick decide they should give away the ending. i almost put the book on the shelf till i forgot what they said, but i decided to read it anyway. i actually think it may have enhanced my experience with it, but i can't be sure if i would have enjoyed it more had i not known the ending.     anyway, this was the first war novel i read, and i thought it was fantastic. at first i had problems with the character of maria, but by the end really liked her. all of the other characters i thought were well developed and interesting. i really liked that the story took place over the course of only a few days. i would definitely recommend it to others.
0553801473|5.0|When I started reading this book, it was kinda confusing since it doesn't just pick up where book 4 leaves off but reads parallel.  Once you get used to that, though, the plot is so intriguing and twisting and so entertaining.  I am not usually a fan of fantasy but I love this series.  The characters are ones you care about and show both good and bad traits making them real.  As the book goes on it gets better and better.  All the cliffhangers at the end just make me wish the next book was already published so I could know what happens next.  Definitely read this series and this book.
B005HBP70U|5.0|In true masterpiece form, this episode \\"takes us up.  It brings us down.  It plants our feet back on the ground!\\"  But, we all know that can't last.  There are two blaring clues to the last seven (I can't believe it!  Say it isn't so!!!) episodes of this season.  I'm not telling.<br /><br />I don't know how much adrenaline my body can take, but this one tests it once again!<br /><br />I actually found three continuity issues.  The most glaring is that with the rearview mirrors in Walt and Mike's vehicles, one second they're there, the next second, they're gone.  This is an issue that has bothered me with movies and TV since I can remember.  It's just annoying, and apparently the only way to deal with some scenes logistically.  The next is Walt's glasses.  They keep tipping them in different ways to avoid glare and reflection.  One minute, the right temple will be half an inch above his ear, and the next, it will be in place.  His lenses have gone from lined bifocals early on, to progressive lenses later.  That makes some sense, because he is more prosperous.  However in a scene where they are sitting on a table and we see through them, although there is a prescription, there is no multifocal distortion.  The third issue is a dropped drum that magically changes direction 90 degrees in a couple of scenes.<br /><br />These are are imperfections in what I consider to be the most perfectly produced series ever, and the only reason I notice these things is that because every tiny detail, from a dropped word to a seemingly meaningless object ends up interlacing into the story in future episodes.  I feel like Vince Gilligan must somehow be related to the Coen brothers for his seemless story-telling.<br /><br />The thing is that I have become hyper-aware of every detail in every episode, and when continuity is dropped or set aside for simplicity, I catch more and more of it.<br /><br />Even detailing these few flaws, I find myself typing away with the anticipation of a small child on Christmas eve as I wait until tomorrow morning when I can watch episode 6!  I refuse to watch this or any other series with commercials.  Broadcast and satelite/cable pretty much no longer exist in my world.  Don't tell Amazon, but I'd gladly pay more for a season pass for this series, at least!il tomorrow morning when I can watch episode 6!  I refuse to watch this or any other series with commercials.

B004QL7K2K|2.0|As someone who counts Stanley Donen's [[ASIN:B000AP04MO Two for the Road]] as one of his all-time favorite films, I was hoping this 2011 romantic drama might transcend its time-spanning gimmick of using one day every year - July 15 - as the touchstone for a couple who appear destined for happiness together but not without a lot of emotional curveballs and unforeseen detours. It doesn't. In fact, the film's structural conceit heightens the contrivances that keep the viewer from fully investing in the fate of what the filmmakers would like us to believe are soul mates. It's really impossible to calibrate why this mismatched pair continues to connect over the years other than to fulfill the cardboard dimensions of David Nicholls' verbose screenplay, which is in turn based on his [[ASIN:B0036S4CTS 2009 book]].  The lugubrious result makes for particularly disappointing cinema given that the film was directed by Danish filmmaker Lone Scherfig, who helmed Carey Mulligan's star-making turn in the far more satisfying [[ASIN:B002ONC9NC An Education]] (2009).<br /><br />The story begins on the night of July 15, 1988 when recent Edinburgh University graduates Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew end up spending the night together. She comes from a working-class background and is consequently smart and caustic but insecure as evidenced by the pair of granny glasses she constantly wears. He comes from money and has the cocky manner befitting someone whose shallow aim in life is to become famous since he's already rich. They connect for no apparent reason from the outset and start a friendship that borders on codependency. We see them every year thereafter on the same day as they grow from young adulthood to early middle age. Emma stumbles out of the gate becoming increasingly depressed working at a Mexican restaurant in London. Dexter finds fame as the sleazy host of a VH1-type entertainment-lite program. She eventually finds her footing as a writer, while he goes through a drug-induced tailspin. Their up-and-down lives intertwine at defining moments when something decisive happens to one, and the other has to cope with whatever the new situation is. The film repeats this pattern so often that it becomes redundant and tiresome even when an inevitable plot device occurs late in the story.<br /><br />I can see why an actress as engaging as Anne Hathaway would be drawn to a part like Emma because she gets to play a wide range of shades and emotions in her character's arc, but there are two things that are off-kilter about her performance. First, her pinched English accent sounds entirely too close to her take-off of Mary Poppins from her guest appearance on [[ASIN:B004DH7XI8 Saturday Night Live]] to be believable. Second, her naturally vibrant presence doesn't lend credibility to the early scenes when she appears to be doing a cheeky throwback to the first [[ASIN:B00006L948 Princess Diaries]] movie. She also makes co-star Jim Sturgess (Jude in [[ASIN:B002G1K82Q Across the Universe]]) look all the more pallid as the pitiable Dexter. He seems to be channeling Hugh Grant in order to evoke the charm necessary to attract Emma, but he suffers even more from the story's thumbnail-sketch approach. As Emma's failed love interest Ian, Rafe Spall is convincingly annoying as an aspiring stand-up comic without any talent, while Romola Garai has the thankless role of Dexter's humorless lover-turned-wife. Both appear to be playing stock characters for the sake of the central love story. At least Patricia Clarkson lends her requisite &eacute;lan as Dexter's worldly mother, but her scenes are all too brief. Despite a clever time-shifting scene at Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, the film left me dry-eyed wanting to see [[ASIN:B000AP04MO Two for the Road]] again.in.

0439813786|5.0|This book is a must have in one's own private collection.  I read this book to my daughter when she was four years old and she loved  to make up her own story to the beautiful illustrations.  It will become a great classic I'm so sure.  Every time we would go to the library to borrow it would always be checked out.  So we had to buy the book  ourselves.  An  investment I don't regret  making.

0439023491|5.0|Ok I must admit, when I finished The Hunger Games, I said to myself, \\"Self, there is no way this book will be as good as The Hunger Games.\\"  Wow, it is very hard for me to admit, but myself was WRONG!!!  *gasp*, I know Right--So hard to believe!  This book was AWESOMESAUCE x 2!  It led into the story and made me fall even more in love with Katniss.  I also LOVE the fact that the aurthor picked right back up with the story and the first 2 chapters were not a repeat of the previous book.  I HATE THIS!!!!  I have already read the First book, do I want to re-read it again?  HUMMMMM???? (well with this series I probably will read them again--but normally my answer is DUHH--NOOO!)  Great book! Great story! AWESOMESAUCE 2 nough said.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|This digger/loader is a great toy! My 19 month old loves trucks and this is a very close replica of the real thing. It's great he has one to play with after seeing the real ones on the street. He plays with it every day. He has dropped it many times and it's held up fine. I also like it b/c the other Bruder trucks I've seen are quite large, but this one is a manageable size. Only thing about this toy is the arms get stuck in an up or down position and my son can't get them to move on his own. I have to pry it into place for him, and it does take some jiggling. But I still give it 5 stars b/c it doesn't really impact the ability to play with the toy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I got this book because some of the blog's I follow just kept talking about it.  I would read over and over and over how GREAT this book was.  Let's be honest, if I didnt think the people who write the blogs I follow were anything other than geniuses, I would't follow their blogs, now would I---and yep I was right to follow them.  This book was built up to be GREAT-and it actually lived up to the build up.  I am a sucker for trilogies, something about following a story line and character through different stages.  All I can say is AWESOMESAUCE to all three books!  I can't wait for the movie---I just wonder if they will live up to the book.  That will be VERY hard to do!!!
B00000J7JO|2.0|En mi opinión es un álbum sobrevalorado. Es verdad que contiene muy buenas canciones (Scar Tissue, Around The World) pero otras son verdaderas bobadas (Road Trippin´). Con este disco los RHCP se establecen en la clase burguesa del r´n´r business, para desgracia de sus admiradores que nos gusta más su etapa más punky. Después de este vendrían otros dos discos incluso peores, By The Way y el insufrible Stadium Arcadium. Ahora entiendo los motivos de Frusciante para abandonar la nave.
0439023513|5.0|Ok that may have been a bit dramatic, but I did not want this story to end.  I wanted to see Katniss and Peeta get married, have lots of babies and bake and hunt their way to a happily ever after.  PROBABLY WHY I AM NOT AN AURTHOR!  That would have NEVER worked with this series.  This was a great ending to a great trilogy.  I must admit Ms. Suzanne, you caused me many hours of lost sleep---almost missed 2 deadlines at work, and a husband that got so tired of me reading my Kindle at the dinner table that he threatened to hide my charger!  Was it all worth it?  ABSOLUTELY!  AWESOMESAUCE X 3!!!!!

1594744769|5.0|I was looking for a good summer read.  I love books that don't fit in a box of sorts and this one is so unique in that it intertwines the pictures with the story.  A very visual experience.  It was great. I hope this author does more!
B004Y1USJE|3.0|Yesmusic is a distant past.  The intricate melodies, the soaring vocals and the intricate keyboard signatures are nowhere to be found here - probably a result of the hollow, poppy Trevor Horne.  But the album is so 'dark' owing mainly I think to the overpowering influence of the bass (Chris Squire  - great in its place but not dominating nearly every track. The influence of Steve Howe is as usual of the highest quality such as in Solitaire and Into The Storm. However, the title track(s) - Fly From Here Parts 1-5 are a weak attempt at quality progrock - any passion in the music/vocals lost in the haze of bass. For the Yesfan Jon Anderson's 'Survival' is a much better option.  We have here a glorified tribute band.  If it really needs to be said there is no Yes without Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman - a big disappointment!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|So, these aren't the original unaltered movies we loved.  And Lucas says he won't be releasing those movies on Blu-Ray.  But guess what?  He said the same thing about the DVDs.  And yet, there was a box set a few years after that with the new versions AND the originals.  George Lucas knows more people will pay more money for the original versions; as soon as he thinks he's made as much money as he can off these ruined movies, he'll release the good ones again.

B001E45XT4|5.0|There is not a better way to test a new sound equipment (whatever it is) than playing your favourite Phish CD and crank it up. If you know what I mean. All I can say is that it needs a deeper bass boom boom. The mid and high levels are fine, clear and distinguishable.<br /><br />I also did the Battlefield Bad Company 2 test, and indeed, a bit more of boom boom bass would have been great! Some Audio FX sounded a bit flat IMO.<br /><br />But no complaint intended, this product does a good job.<br /><br />I am happy with this purchase and the sound quality is good. I had couple of VoIP calls and it was a satisfactory experience.<br /><br />Cable has a good length, the unit is solid and does not feel cheap. Velvet pads are fine. Arch does not feel tight. And the headset looks great.<br /><br />I do recommend this product.<br /><br />If you are a sound geek you're obviously interested in other brands and you already know how they perform.<br /><br />But if you want a good product that does the job and is affordable go for it, this is a great buy.<br /><br />PS. Wish I had tiger sized claws so I could have opened the package with no stress.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|Kid Rock's Born Free is one of the most fabulous albums I have ever purchased from ANY artist. I admit I became aware of Kid Rock by way of country music, and I haven't been a fan anywhere near as long as some of the other reviewers here. Before I bought this album, I had his Rock N Roll Jesus CD.... I liked that one, but Born Free was what really made me realize the full extent of his talent and fall in love with his music as a whole - and I purchased several more of his albums after that.<br /><br />My favorite song from Born Free is Purple Sky. It is rock n roll perfection, and it feels so good that I wish it could go on forever. Absolutely amazing.<br /><br />There are so many beautiful songs on this album, including the patriotic Born Free and Times Like These (I know he's singing about Detroit, but this song could apply to America as a whole), Rock On (which has gone a long way in helping me heal from a painful divorce), Collide (a gorgeous duet with Sheryl Crow) and When It Rains (a song about untimely death that brings a tear to the eye). I also like the feel-good songs including Rock Bottom Blues, Flyin' High and God Bless Saturday. There's not a bad song on the whole album, and Kid Rock knocks it out of the park blending rock n roll, country and blues. This disc has such a great vibe that I could listen to it all day long.<br /><br />I hate reading all these gripes accusing Kid Rock of \\"selling out\\" because he's taking a new direction. I like his older music too, but he has evolved as an artist and as a man... And I should think that most longtime fans have also evolved as people over the last decade or so. He's 40 years old now, and his life is different than it was 15 years ago. People should expect that to be reflected in his music. I think he is showing us what's inside his soul, and I appreciate his honesty. As much as I appreciated it when he was being honest about his bad@$$ ways.
031236198X|3.0|I came into work today to find this on my desk, a gift from my boss.  Since there have been a lot of changes going on in our department she thought it would be good reading for me.  I found it very interesting, but sometimes too simplistic.  Still, I'm grateful she brought it to my attention.<br /><br />Our Iceberg is Melting on the surface is just a little fable about a group of penguins living out their life.  But the lesson shows how to work with personalities of all types and how to make things happen.  This is expressed through Fred, the penguin who found that the iceberg they were living on was no longer safe and had to set out to change the top committee's minds, and also help them express the plans to the others of the community and try to convince everyone that change was good.  It elaborated on the teamwork that they used as well.<br /><br />Each of the penguins was supposed to be a different type of person in this book so they were all very different personality types from one another.  They weren't really developed well, you were just told what their attributes were and how they meshed with the other penguins.<br /><br />There was a good story to this book.  But since it was geared towards adults, I found the actual storyline and penguin fable a little too simplistic.  It seemed like it could have been written for kindergarteners.  I know that it was just too show how easy the concept was, but it made the read so fast and I would have loved to delve more in depth to what the book was saying.  It did offer good points on working with people of different types and personalities though which was the main goal of the book.  It also showed how to move people to action.<br /><br />Definitely an interesting read if you're trying to interact with people in the business world, but it could have been developed and expanded on more in my opinion.<br /><br />Our Iceberg is Melting<br />Copyright 2005<br />146 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

0670022411|3.0|I read Twilight. I read this. They are like mother and daughter. Not that this is a copy. I don't accuse it of plagarism, but there are undisputable similarities. For example: [*BRIEF SPOILER ALERT* The Congregation vs. Volutrri; Matthew leaves Diana for fear of hurting her himself and for fear of attracting more danger to her and she has an emmotional breakdown=see Edward and Bella in the second Twilight book; Diana's not a damsel in distress, or so she insists, but she sure does seem to have a lot of mishaps that require his help; and last but not least: she smells intoxicatingly good to him-- been there done that.*] It's a fine story for teen angst, not so much for adults.  I grew out of my teenage hormones, but Diana Bishop and Matthew Clairmont (we're supposed to somehow disregard the fact that he's an ancient vampire?) have not. I found that disappointing. I've read a review that said this harkens back to an Ann Rice novel.  Discovery of Witches and Interview with a Vampire might have bumped up against each other on the subway. Briefly. With no eye contact. They both talk about historical things, I guess. All that said, however, It captured my attention enough that I'll probably pick up the next one just to see what happens. Maybe I'm a sucker for punishment.
1423113381|4.0|After reading the entire Percy Jackson series (and suffering through the mockery of a movie), I initially skipped over this series, thinking it would pale in comparison. I jumped to the Heroes of Olympus series and was pleasantly surprised, so I decided to give this a try was again pleasantly surprised. Riordan delivers the same suspenseful page-turning action and plot twists that made me fall in love with Demigods. This series will be a must read!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Using the keyboard to write this review, the word prediction is pretty good but not perfect. It supposedly gets better the more you text, email, and facebook as long as you have them linked to the keyboard. The customization is nice but limited. One thing I would like is a swype type option. Overall, not many complaints, this is my main keyboard now.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|Still one of my favorite movies! The Blu-Ray is beautiful and really helps you see the color and opulence that was intended when the movie was made.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|As an 18 year old guy, when first hearing about this movie, I thought it would be pretty bad, as many other Disney Channel movies are in my opinion.  However, I recently caught a few episodes of the show Good Luck Charlie, which I surprisingly enjoyed, and have since developed a *slight* crush on Bridgit Mendler.  When I found out that she was in Lemonade Mouth, I figured I might give it a chance.  Man, was I surprised at how well done this movie was.  Every time the band started playing a song, I couldn't help but tap my foot and smile.  The characters were very believable and it was nice to see some more serious issues in a kids' movie.  I have now found out that the movie was based on a book, and have done some research on it, and though Disney made many kid-friendly changes, I'm still quite interested in checking out the book.    The music is well written both musically and lyrically.  You won't find any corny High School Musical-esque lyrics in this movie.  Most of the songs are about friendship, perseverance, and standing up for what you believe in, which tie in with the overall theme of the movie.  The music is catchy, and the singing is pretty decent, though there is some obvious pitch-correcting at points. Overall, Lemonade Mouth is an excellent watch for the whole family to enjoy.  Be heard, be strong, be proud.

1250004349|3.0|As other reviews have mentioned, this book has great potential, especially when it comes to the historical fiction aspect of the story. A fascinating and tragic look at awful events that took place in France during WWII. However, the story gets lost when the somewhat \\"pathetic\\" main character struggles to internalize what she has learned about  these true events. The last half of this book was lackluster.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|I've been a hard copy and Nook reader for years and was encouraged by a friend to try Kindle in order to download Amazon ebooks.  I've only downloaded a few books onto my iPad, so maybe they're not the best measure, but the app is a little awkward.  I really do prefer the Barnes & Noble Nook app more.  The controls/settings are much more intuitive and user-friendly on the Nook.  B&N took some time to work out the kinks in their app and maybe Kindle will follow suit.    Also, the reviewing system is kinda crazy.  The first book I read had an inappropriate, spoiler-filled review that smacked of cyber-bullying.  Hopefully Amazon keeps an eye on these things.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I just started this series yesterday and I'm already on the third book. Fantastic modern take on a 2,000 year old Druid living in Arizona and a world full of ALL the Gods and Belief systems. I laughed myself silly most of the time, the writer is just that GOOD! Hope you try this series, you will not regret it. Great pick-me-up when you want something to mesmerize your brain AND tickle your funny bone!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first book was the best, But I enjoyed them all.  I am so happy there was finally a series not wholly based on love and crushes.  It was fun, suspensful and just enough romance.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Some puzzle games can be frustrating but this can manage to fix that with its soundtrack. the puzzles themselves are good and the simplicity of the graphics are nice and calming.<br /><br />overall great game.
B0058OUJA4|3.0|Not all games r perfect like alot of reviews I have read alot of games have flaws / glitches more so tower defense games like this this game is fun n im actually starting to like playing them but like other games of this kind it is far from perfect/awesome etc n I still belive alot of 5 to 4 star reviews are bogus n the insults r so not cool
B005BZQVJ8|1.0|Not a good movie. Liberal slant and anti-creationism. Sorry to have wasted my time and money to watch this. This is not a movie for young kids.
0156027321|4.0|I wanted desperately for give this book five stars, but certain aspects of the story bothered me too much.  On many levels, it is one of the most original books I have read in a long time.  Though the pace of the plot meanders in the middle, there certainly is a lot tucked into these 320 pages.    The Author's Note at the beginning of the book was a source of aggravation for me.  When authors insert themselves into the story to present a work of fiction as if it were a work of nonfiction, it blurs the lines of reality.  Making certain readers wonder if something really happened also takes away from their reading experience.      The early part of the book follows Pi (Piscine) and his early life with his family.  As a youth he explores several religions but finds good in them all.  Pi's explorations are a device which allows for the extraordinary events that make up the bulk of the text.    When Pi's family leaves India for Canada, the ship that carries Pi and his family sinks.  Left on a lifeboat with an eclectic group of animals, Pi must survive in the most dire of cirsumstances.  A hyena, a wounded zebra, an orangutan, and a 450 pound bengal tiger compose the rest of the crew.  Almost immediately, the most primitive of animal instincts take over.      Pi's journey is hard to believe, even when Pi tries to tell it to others.  Which clevely leads reads back to the religion theme of the beginning and makes readers wonder if Pi is believable.  If nothing else, the book is a clever premise even if the execution is not flawless.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Books 1, 2, 3...works of genius. Amazing! Spellbinding! Couldn't shut up about them. Book 4? Hmmm. Maybe it's a fluke. Maybe the author has been ill. But here now we have Book 5 and the realization that it's no fluke. Martin has lost his way.<br /><br />Like every other reader, I want the original characters and families to come back! I want them to evolve, grow up, turn evil, go mad, save the world, destroy the world...anything! I could give two figs about the hundreds of new, irrelevant, window-dressing characters that were introduced in 4 and 5: One-Eyed This, One-Armed That, the Giant, the Forked Beard, Green Grace, Blue Grace, Kindly Man. It's exhausting. If there's a prize for 'Most Useless Characters in a Single Novel', Martin wins.<br /><br />The power house families have crumbled but rather than rebuild them (Lady Catelyn appears only briefly in Book 4 despite her character's fantastic potential for vengeance and villainry!!) Martin has thrown us bones like Ramsay and Daario, hoping that we will keep gnawing.<br /><br />Seriously, I love George Martin's writing and he tells a wonderful story but I'm not sure I can endure a Number 6. Maybe we're all better off watching where HBO takes the story.
B000U0F7RG|4.0|We bought the whole series of The Gilmore Girls after the CW took our nightly viewing pleasure off the air a couple months back.  It's a nice collection, but for one small flaw - the sound seems a little off kilter - it's as though the bass is missing, or the ambient noise, or something, at least on the first season, which is the only one we have watched so far.  This makes the sound a little stagey - and kinda flat.    Otherwise, enjoying our new purchase.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Before I Go To Sleep is a well-written thought provoking book.  Not quite a thriller, but a very original mystery.  Christine, the main character has an unusual problem; every day is a new one and she can't remember anything.  Each new day her husband Ben explains who she is and how things happened to her. She never remembers the previous day of her life. Can you imagine what it would be like to never remember those \\"foot-in-the-mouth\\" moments of your life; or the great moments?  Your wedding, your children's birth, finishing that marathon.  This is Christine's problem.  The story plods along somewhat in the middle as Christine struggles to put things together each and every day.  Even with her amnesia, she begins to realize that something in her life is not quite as it should be.  If you are expecting a thrill ride, you won't find it with this book, but you will find a well-written, insightful look at how our ability to remember things and store memories is a very large part of who we are.
159562015X|4.0|While this is a book review, the first thin you need to know is that the Strengths Finder 2.0 book is actually just a written, in-depth, support document for the test that you take on the StrengthsFinder web site.The core idea to the test and the book is to identify your strengths and work on them instead of spending all kinds of time trying to fix your weaknesses. If you just think about it a little bit, it makes sense that you can spend days and weeks trying to improve in an area where you are not terribly strong while improvement in areas where you are already strong will come to you, fast & furious.<br /><br />The book is broken down into two parts, an introduction that goes over the concepts and science behind finding your strengths, and a huge section that defines all the various strengths identified in the test. Between reading the first and second section, you're supposed to take the test.<br /><br />The book is really interesting to read. The first section brings out a number of interesting facts from different areas of psychological research that seem... accurate. I've read some psychology types of books where so much of the \\"science\\" reads like so much feel-good claptrap. This is not one of those. There are discussions about the fact that you still have weaknesses and blind spots that you'll need to take into account, even as you work on your strengths.<br /><br />I do find this all very useful. I appreciate the insights into what makes me more motivated. It works. Unfortunately, I haven't also incorporated a regular review of these goals into my workload and I think to fully realize the results that needs to happen. Also, a psychological test I went through with my previous employer emphasized that knowing yourself is important, but that knowing others and figuring out how best to communicate with them (note, not adjusting yourself, just your message, you can do this and stick to your strengths) is the best way to improve your working relationships. Because of that, I feel like I only have half the tools I need. Yeah, I can make guesses at what other people might be (and sometimes it's obvious), but not knowing, it is possible to still mess up the communication.<br /><br />Overall, a great read, good information, extremely useful, but still not quite enough for what it sets out to do, at least in my opinion. However, I am going to try to focus on this on a regular basis (daily) so that I can start to use what I've learned and learn more (after all, I'm a Learner).use of that, I feel like I only have half the tools I need.

B002ZG99TA|5.0|I rented this movie today and have to say I truly enjoyed it.  Denzel Washington is still fantastic as always.  Chris Pine was extremely good as well. This movie proved to be a nice edge of your seat thrill ride.  I will be adding this movie to my collection.  Rent it or buy it-you can't go wrong.
B003L77GGK|5.0|going on to their 7th season this fall 2011, ive been a fan since 2005 and this show is amazing. it has action, storyline, comedy, anything you could want in a tv show, is mixed together. full of supernatural things they deal with, ghouls, reapers, demons, ghosts, even angels.
0767812387|5.0|I watched this at the movies when it came out in 1998 and find myself still watching it every few years. This is the ultimate feel-good romantic movie! Great cast, wonderful dancing, sweet story, what more could you ask?
B0029QRA1U|2.0|I returned it and purchased the Ion Audio REC2PC RCA-USB Cable adapter instead and attached that to my existing turntable.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Needs SD option.  Currently you can not move to SD. Nook has the option to move to SD. Until amazon corrects that this application gets three stars.
1405249536|3.0|Sometimes you don't know if LS is writing for kids or for adults. Sometimes he explains every 'strange' word for kids and sometimes he assumes that you have a vast experience in life. He made intelligent characters and incredible goofy ones.<br /><br />So if you want to read this book don't expect too much but read it while you have nothing else to read and you want to read something... like myself with the two firsts of the series that were in my doughter's bedroom... It'll be long down the road till I'll read the next one.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|Though there were parts that I'd call melodramatic, this was a compelling and very moving story centering around events during the July 16, 1942 roundup of Jews in Paris.  Told from dual perspectives, the story takes a few mostly-unexpected twists, keeping things moving nicely. I am a voracious reader, and this was a great book in a line of mediocre reads lately. I went through it in two days (and I work and am a mother of 2, so that's saying a lot!) I will warn you, I found myself sobbing in one part of this book! Enjoy.
0307593495|1.0|If an author wants to write a book about growing old in Sweden and having to endure personal angst, failing health issues and the harridans that are the main character's closest relatives, fine.  But if you call it a murder mystery, you should respect the reader.  That means the plot should be free from contrived coincidences and fundamental motives should be explained.       Henning Mankell's \\"The Troubled Man\\" is a smorgasbord of mystery novel silliness. For example: Why did the submarine commander suddenly disappear? What was he afraid of?  Thirty years after the crucial event of the book and twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, who cares if he was a spy?  Why was his wife killed?  Who killed her?  Even Wallander admits that had the submarine commander been exposed today he would have treated as a hero - not a traitorous villain. So fear of exposure can be ruled out. But what can we rule in?     And it's too contrived that the protagonist, Wallander, should happen to know a high level East German officer of Stasi who happened to defect to him years earlier? And that this officer would just happen to be privy to nasty, nefarious poisons used by Stasi assassins in the 1960's? And how fortunate for us, the readers, that Wallander just happened to grow up in the same small town with a bullied kid that just happened to collect a vast amount of minutia on Swedish Naval history.  Erle Stanley Garner at his worst didn't have this many preposterous plot props.     This book is chock-a-block full of angst and turmoil but it's missing basic expository. Explaining certain details - like why a pair of shoes was placed in a certain way  - isn't necessary. But forgetting to explain adequately the basic reasons for the crime(s) is a form of literary fraud.  Or, at least, genre fraud. Call it a coming-of-old-age novel. Call it a kill-off-the-main-character novel. But don't call it a murder mystery.     (p.s. Under normal circumstances I would have thrown this book across the room upon completion. Since I wasn't about to throw my Kindle, I found myself tossing old issues of Opera News and The New Yorker instead.  Apologies to Opera News.)
B004QL7K2K|3.0|I've been thinking about this movie and writing this review for a long time when I first heard the premise of a couple getting together every year, afterwards I was intrigued by it. In 1978 there was a movie called Same Time, Next Year which had the same premise, but after seeing One Day I was kind of disappointed in how it turned out.<br /><br />July 15th, 1988 Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Dexter (Jim Sturgess) graduate from college, during the drunken revelries they discover each other, spend the night together and start a twenty year friendship. One Day revisits them every year on this anniversary, to see where they are in their lives and in their relationship with each other, and in their relationships with other people. Like a lot of friendships between men and woman over the years, Emma and Dexter flirt with each other and with romance, but usually something intervenes to interrupt their path to romance.<br /><br />Although Hathaway and Sturgess are both strong in their roles, the movie seems overly long in places and Dexter isn't a sympathetic character, even after he realizes what he's been looking for all these years was right there in Emma. I also didn't feel a lot of connection with the characters, who actually fell in love on the first meeting.<br /><br />The movie tries to use a literary conceit in mentioning St Switun's Day, which legend has it that whatever the weather is on July 15th it will be the same for the next 40 days. It was never made clear how this might apply to the characters or situations they find themselves in. The screenplay for One Day was written by the novel's author, David Nicholls, and I assume it's a good representation of his novel. The movie was shot and is set in Scotland, London and Paris and makes the most of the romantic feel of those places, especially Paris.<br /><br />One Day isn't a bad movie but it doesn't draw you in enough, there are moments when you laugh and cry, but Emma and Dexter keep you at arms length.
0553801473|2.0|I was really disappointed with this latest book in the series. I LOVED the books leading up the \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" and was expecting the same for this book. The best way to put it is \\"it crawls\\". There is way too much detail and very little action. All of the characters seem to be at a standstill waiting for someone else to move, but they don't. It was very frustrating to finish. I would be extremely upset if I had waited 5 years for this, but I started the series this year. I really hope the next book makes up for this one and doesn't take another 5 years. If you are looking for a great fantasy series in the meantime, check out the Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson - the first book is absolutely amazing!<br /><br />Happy Reading
B0058OUJA4|1.0|this is such a rip off of hex defense its really embarrassing. they didn&apos;t even bother coming up with a new name just changed the first part. absolutely rediculous.
B00000J2PH|5.0|This is not a \\"classic.\\"  It is The Classic.  Of all the 200+ LP's (yes, vinyl) I own this is unquestionably the most beautiful.  King's voice is perfect, the lyrics are moving, touching and clever.  There's not one song on this album that's not timeless.  Do not let this experience pass you up.  Buy it!
B004LWZVZC|2.0|wow redford.... know what you get when you serve up paper mache painted to look like a christmas goose?....hollowed-out, tasteless paper mache for dinner. that is what this movie felt like.  2 dimensional, you could almost hear, \\"ready, action!..cut\\". none of the scenes nor sentiment had any depth or realism to them at all.  couldnt even finish it for lack of fresh air.  the movie died of a shot to the head, emptying it of its brains and blood supply, thusly its ability to thrive
B0058OUJA4|5.0|I skipped the tutorial, because it seemed easy enough. So far I really like it. I didn&apos;t get far enough yet to see if your turrets and such are upgradeable, but even if they&apos;re not, I think the different maps and weapon varieties provide enough strategy to keep me satisfied with it. One thing I thought was pretty cool was the ability to playback each round that you lose to see what you did wrong. A If it werent for the fact that I already have so many similar type games on my phone I might have bought it, but it&apos;s a great free app. Droid Incredible.
B000002KY8|5.0|This is probably one of Prince's greatest albums. It starts with the ever-so-funky 1999, and just rolls on from there. Unlike some of the earlier work, where it kind of skips all over, this album was put together in a deliberate way. Grab your attention and keep it, if you think you know where it's going, you don't. Several of his most influential songs are here. 1999, Little Red Corvette, the widely overlooked DMSR, International Lover (also overlooked on many collections) and a never talked about gem, Free. This album is a must have for ANY music lover's collection, your collection isn't complete with out it! CRANK IT UP & JAM!!!!!!
0439023521|5.0|I have to admit I had absolutely no interest in this book based on the plot description, but a friend gave me the series, so I thought I'd give it a try.  Wow, was I pleasantly surprised!!!  Love Katniss as the strong female lead, and the love story was very unexpected as well!  Loved it and can't wait to read the other two in the series!!!
B000060P79|1.0|Boy band with guitars. This CD is not worth buying. Don't know why people compare it to Greenday or Blink 182 sounds nothing like them.
B003SNJYSK|5.0|This was my first Jo Nesbo, and I have already started the next and have the rest lined up to read.  My only suggestion would be for the reader to either jot down the character names or highlight them.  I found that, like in reading Russian literature, the names were unfamiliar to me and often similar enough for me to confuse one or two.  Also, it is very important not to skim through the back flash war chapters.
1401924751|5.0|I have several decks of Doreen's cards which I use regularly but I must say I was thrilled that she published the Life Purpose deck. Who isn't questioning their life purpose these days!  Thank you so Doreen, keep up the great work.  Also have many of her books as well!!  Thank you!
B004I1WIWU|5.0|First off, I'm sitting here with my second copy of the album. The first copy had some distortion on the treble of side 2 which was very distracting. Amazon was very understanding and helpful as usual, and I had my second copy within a day of filing the return. Amazon picked up my first copy at the same time they delivered the second.    The album itself is wonderful. Of course it has the radio hit \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" which is a great track, but as usual the radio is oblivious to the rest of the gold on this album. The album is full of great tracks. I definitely recommend this album!
B003Y5H574|5.0|This didn't have police chases, the music is appropriate to the plot and some of it's really lovely. The plot made sense (in our current contexts, although at my age I still reel with shock at the freedom of speech of this day in comparison to how restricted it was when i was 17.) I think Steve Carell could do Cary Grant type movies, he showed real talent, much more depth than that Office guy. I'm not fond of Julianne Moore but I liked her very  much, Marisa T.,  is wonderful always, the young actors were very fine. Ryan G's hunkness was hilarious and he's a a fine actor. But every actor was excellent, I felt a sense of enchanting hopefullness, and I've only viewed it 3 times so far. It seemed a bit long but I can't think of any part that  should have fell to the cutting floor. It's about time someone made a movie that makes me feel like seeing it 3 times, in a month is not excessive. Excluding Twilight of course.
0439023521|5.0|I thought this series sounded really strange and I was not interested. I went to the beach and decided to pick up the first book and I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!! I had to immediately get the second and third. Now I can't find a book that I can enjoy as much as I enjoyed reading these. You really escape to different world.

1932100660|5.0|My wife & I are reading this very heavily researched, detailed & convincing book. We've read other health oriented books dealing w/ the nutients & digestion/assimulation of food.

B0047Y0FGY|1.0|Very disappointing.  If it were possible, I'd demand a refund.  Very dull reading, rehash of tv scripts, and her attempts at &#34;humor&#34; fall flat.  One star only.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|Picked this up to satisfy my twilight fix, and add to the collection.  Thought it had slipcover to match my other discs... It did not.  Also, was duel language on front cover, which made me think I picked up a dubbed version.  Overall, the movie played fine, but felt a bit deceived  that the DVD shipped wasn't exactly the one pictured.
0743298039|4.0|I was fraught with indecision about how many stars I wished to give this book. At times, I thought the situations and writing too dramatic to believe or respect, but at others, the author wowed me with beautiful imagery and a smart, dysfunctional heroine. By the end, I did love this book, but the doubts I'd harbored about the theatrics inside it kept me from giving it five stars. The last third of the book was an amazing wrap up!
B0034G4ORC|3.0|Receieved movie ahead of schedule and the movie was in perfect condition.  I would definitely order from this distributer again.
B004SBQAN8|4.0|Saw at the theater and enjoyed it.  Decided I wanted to own it.  I loved the action sequences!  All the gushy romance, however, was getting on my nerves- and I love romance!!!  Some of it was just too much- for example:  while aliens are chasing you down to destroy you and your loved one, why would you both go hide out at your high school and develop film?  Doesn't make sense!!
B004PR71JC|5.0|The cd arrived as expected when placing the order, I was both pleaseed with purchase process as well as I love the music.  My 7 year old niece is in love with the soundtrack - we play it endlessly.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|I have read five books on the \\"Great Contraction of 2007-2009\\" and have now added the viewing of \\"Inside Job\\" to my knowledge base. \\"Inside Job\\" is good but only presents one perspective to a very complex story.<br /><br />For those who want to learn more, I strongly recommend: John Mauldin's \\"Endgame\\" which provides a sixty year perspective on the emergence of a 60 year debt-cycle which permeated and influenced the financial world and provided the catalyst for ignoring risk for out-sized gains; Michael Lewis' \\"The Big Short\\" which provides a glimpse into the minds of a few who began to see clearly what was underway and prepared themselves to make billions as the world markets collapsed; David Wessel's \\"In the Fed We Trust\\" which highlights what Hank Paulson and others did behind the scenes to insure the \\"The Great Contraction\\" did not morph into \\"The Second Great Depression\\"; and the most recently released \\"Reckless Endangerment\\" by NY Times reporter Gretchen Morgenson which names many more names than \\"Inside Job.\\"<br /><br />One of my great take-aways from all of my research is that our lay-press is inept. It is clear that there is a Washington elite that does not bear the scrutiny it should. Pundits most often focus on the politicians and are missing the bigger story of what the less public \\"public and public-private servants\\" are doing to serve their own needs. We need more scrutiny of the un-elected and those appointed to regulatory agencies.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Every now and then a somewhat inconsistent band will take an unexpected leap in artistic capacity and create something beautiful. Some bands do so from obscurity, others while already having established a sizable following. Shinedown accomplished just this with 2008's The Sound of Madness. Having released two commercially successful albums: Leave A Whisper and Us And Them, Shinedown not only sold a few million albums but offered some great radio rock and built up a respectable fan base. While using the predictable and familiar song structure (verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus) ensured Shinedown's accessibility, the true strength lay in vocalist Brent Smith. Sporting a combination of hard rock and alternative metal, Shinedown's lyrical moods were rather melancholy with a little bit of inspirational (\\"Fly From The Inside\\"), and the music tended to follow suit. A powerful vocalist and relatable lyrics are sure ways to win over an audience, but only up to a point.<br /><br />From the opener \\"Devour,\\" the change in Shinedown is as subtle as a fist to the face. The production is crystal clear, the levels perfectly mixed (that means an audible bass!), the guitars an even balance of melodic and heavy, and the vocals emotional and strong. Shinedown found their sound (no pun intended) with The Sound of Madness, and the purity of that sound carries through the entire album. Balancing rockers with ballads fairly evenly, the album is sure to appeal to just about any modern rock fan. It's not sonically adventurous, but it's not meant to be. It's comfortable and executed with precision. There are a few blemishes, such as the awkward \\"for yourself\\" that Brent yells during \\"Sound of Madness,\\" and \\"Breaking Inside\\" is a little weaker than the rest of the tracks. But despite these minor flaws, Shinedown distinguished themselves, truly made a name for themselves, with this album. It is unquestionably one of the best hard rock albums of the 2000's. [For those who found it to contain too few rockers, the original limited edition contained three heavy tracks: \\"I Own You,\\" \\"The Energy,\\" and \\"Son of Sam.\\"]<br /><br />Recommended: \\"Devour,\\" \\"Second Chance,\\" \\"Cry For Help,\\" \\"Call Me\\"<br /><br />4.5/5few rockers, the original limited edition contained three heavy tracks: \\"I Own You,\\" \\"The Energy,\\" and \\"Son of Sam.\\"]    Recommended: \\"Devour,\\" \\"Second Chance,\\" \\"Cry For Help,\\" \\"Call Me\\"    4.5/5
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Great tower defense game with a very light and simple Ui. As an added bonus it has tools built in that allow you to create your own maps. Which also can go into a market for everyone to download. Such a great game. Especially for free, grab it while you can!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Born this way is great because of the diversity of songs. Dynamic building songs, uptempo rock, dance, electronic, trance...etc. Lady G's vocals are diverse and she sounds unique on every song. I predict Born this Way will stand the test of time better than Gaga's Fame albums.
1594202710|5.0|Professor Henry Kissinger captured the behind the scene story of one of the most significant historic moment close to the end of an era - Mao's most deadly and final assault on his own people during the bloody so-called \\"Cultural Revolution\\". Facing internal chaos, factional in-fights and  threat of Soviet-led-invasion, Mao decided (wisely for once) to turn to America for help. President Nixon exercised his leadership and the political will to take this opportunity to finally open up China and to free its people from tyranny. China from thereon would start its fundamental transformation into a world class economy and never looked back (I hope). The people of United States and China should never forget President Nixon's historical contribution to world peace and freedom he won for chinese people like I who was nearly killed at the time under the brutal oppressive state of Mao's dictatorship. President Nixon shall forever be a hero to me and my family. We shall never forget what he has done for us. Thank you very much Professor Kissinger for writing this book which I and my family will treasure for generations to come!

B003Y5H5FG|4.0|A man moves into a Las Vegas neighborhood, and he may or may not be a vampire. Well, he is a vampire, and that is why some of the locals are disappearing. A young man figures it out and decides to take action. This remake of a good 1985 film is actually an improvement of the original. It has been updated for modern day, with excellent visual effects, and 3D. There are some truly scary moments in this one, and the protagonists are likeable people who are easy to root for. Colin Farrell does a creepy turn as the vampire. This is a good horror film without being excessively violent.

B000L53D4O|5.0|Broke this out about the time my son started crawling around (about 7 or 8 mos. old).  It was nice at this time because it folds down and he could play with the toys while sitting up on the floor.  You can also put it up against a wall so that the activity center directly faces the child.  My son loves spinning the ball in the middle and flipping the animal tabs on the right most of all.  I was worried it would tip over on my son when he eventually pulled himself up on the handle at about 10 months, but it surprisingly leverages all of his weight with nary a tip or lean.  He really loves the mobility this walker provides and is currently zooming all over the house with it.    The size is great and the weight of it is light enough to fold down, pack and carry.  I recently took this to the sprinkler water park with me and it allowed him to have tons of fun and the freedom to self-direct himself in the water.  So many of the littler-toddler kids there were very attracted to this toy and wanted to take it from him to play with too. The only thing is that the stickers you put on some of the activity sections may start to come up on the edges if you expose the walker to water.  This occured after the second trip to the water park.  I think I can glue them back down though.  My son can sort of manuever on grass with it, but the walker definitely works best on flat, unobstructed surfaces.      This is one value-priced toy that has proved to be super-functional and fun enough for me to consider giving away as a gift in the future because of how much my son has used and enjoyed it.

B0000DG00B|5.0|The Allmans played 2 sets at this Festival, one early on and the other later on in the Festival. The 2 sets are similar but not identical (Set 2 includes a &#34;Stormy Monday&#34; while eliminating some others.) Where there are duplications, you will see different versions of the song and it is interesting to see the different takes.  This is a great band at their peak and is one of the limited number of concerts available of Duane Allman. A treat for all fans of the great band. If you have the Fillmore East material, this is something that will complement that and showcases the band a bit earlier in their progression.
B004HO6I2E|3.0|Two friends inadvertently change bodies, assuming each other's life until they are able to reverse the curse that has been placed. While enduring this, they are able to learn about one another, while also appreciating the lives that they have. This is a storyline that we have seen before, and this film does nothing to improve the concept. This is definitely an adult comedy, and it does contain some funny moments. The characters are likeable and I was laughing out loud at times, but overall this is a movie that does not raise the bar of modern comedy in film. It meets the bar just enough to get a modest recommendation.

0385342055|3.0|This  book was okay, but I agree with some of the other reviewers, I would like to see a little more growth in Becky's character if there is another book.  I really loved the first book, because I was exactly like Becky in my early twenties, irresponsible with bills, dodging collectors at time, overspending on clothes and extravagant meals at times to cheer myself up, but I'm 30 and married now and have grown out of it somewhat, though I still have my moments.  This kind of behavior on a 30 year woman with a child gets a little grating.

She has been doing the workout everyday for 2 weeks now and has lost an inch off her waist and everywhere else. She has said that she feels better about herself already. I do crossfit at work and the 30 day shred is kind of similar. It keeps you going and changes up ever few minutes. I have noticed a difference in her and we both like it. She has called me a few times after she has worked out and said that it kicked her butt, but in a good way. I'm just glad she feels better about herself. It was worth the money just for that.

B002ZHKZEM|5.0|I am a relatively new fan of \\"Doctor Who\\"; I actually discovered \\"Torchwood\\" first, then found out that it was a spin-off of DW.  I decided to give it a try and of course, I LOVED it.  I liked Christopher Eccleston (sp?) as the 9th Doctor and was actually disappointed at the end of the first season when he regenerated into David Tennant ... that disappointment lasted all of two minutes, lol.  David is simply BRILLIANT as the Doctor!  Because of him, I purchased seasons 2-4 (I already had season 1).  Then I read that he had left the series. :(  But I heard about these specials...<br /><br />Now I'm not going to give out any spoilers here since I'm not good at that anyway. ;)  So I will just say that this set of specials are wonderful.  I loved each of them.<br /><br />Planet of the Dead was awesome.  I'll just leave it at that.  And if DT had stayed, I think Michelle Ryan should have been considered to be the next companion.  She's wonderful and can definitely hold her own.<br /><br />Water of Mars is just full of intense moments and emotional moments.  You really see the Doctor in rare form here, but it's interesting to see him like this.<br /><br />End of Time 1 & 2 ... What can I say except I needed a box of kleenex by the end.  These two episodes were amazing and the Timothy Dalton cameo was nice to see.  I will say that I was truly surprised with the ending (not the regeneration).  It was also nice to see characters from past seasons, even if it was only for a moment.<br /><br />The video diaries are wonderful.  I love all of David's video diaries.<br /><br />Loved the concert!  The music was beautiful.  Murray Gold is a true genius.  I think 'This is Gallifrey' is my favorite piece, followed closely by 'Rose's Theme' (even though it makes me cry every time I hear it).<br /><br />As far as the extras on the DVDs go, I have read from several other reviewers that they did not like the fact that there was only audio commentary for End of Time 1 & 2.  I would have loved to have commentary on all of the specials, but the fact that there are FULL DW Confidentals (not the cut-down ones we get on the box sets) is a HUGE plus for me.<br /><br />I would recommend this set of DVDs to anyone who is a fan of Doctor Who and/or David Tennant.  I definitely miss seeing him on the show.  Matt Smith is great, don't get me wrong.  I have just always thought of David as MY Doctor; hence the title of my review. :)t the fact that there are FULL DW Confidentals (not the cut-down ones we get on the box sets) is a HUGE plus for me.

B005B0QYMM|5.0|With nothing really to do at the time I decided to check this movie out not expecting much,  but to my surprise while the movie shows itself through the portable camera it actually makes the movie more believable at lot more then the awful Blair Witch Project.  The basic story is you have a group of Ghost hunters who are doing one of their episodes and decided to take on a case of a haunted psychiatric hospital for the less then popular residents with a history of mysterious accidents and the like,  so hoping to get good ratings the team goes in with their phony psychic and have the caretaker lock them inside for the night.  Much to their surprise and growing fears and anxiety the haunting turns out to be real and starts to grow in frequency and violence as the team now find themselves trapped within the hospital with apparently no way out,  you'll see as they try and find different routes out of the building but with growing anxiety and horror they see that whatever haunts the building can manipulate it as well causing hallways to be where there were none before making the team apparently go in circles and so forth.  The ghost and effects are pretty good but what really pulls the movie off is that it doesn't saturate the movie with those effects,  you see doors mysteriously open and close by themselves hear ungodly noises and voices see background movement and of course you will see a few ghosts in the movie that are really frighting and most that are pretty malevolent to our would be ghost hunters. The cast of actors actually did their roles pretty well giving the feel that this was actually happening to them and their own fears triggering greater anxiety and infighting as the group tries to make it out alive.  Again while the movie plays with the portable camera view throughout the movie it isn't as annoying as it was with the BW movie or the first Paranormal Activity movie was when they did their films,  but if you did 't like those movies solely on that one part then this movie isn't for you but if you like a good old fashion ghost movie with a decent cast and effects and with time on your hand I say check the movie out while it's not a blockbuster summer movie it's still one to at least watch once...part then this movie isn't for you but if you like a good old fashion ghost movie with a decent cast and effects and with time on your hand I say check the movie out while it's not a blockbuster summer movie it's still one to at least watch once...
B005G67CYA|5.0|I'm frequently around a lot of self described music snobs who are always lamenting how pop music is cliched, trite, and without any \\"true talent.\\" The next time I hear them talk like that, I'm pointing them in the direction of Natalia. Once again, it seems the Brits have a corner on the market for fresh talent. This album is dark, slightly industrial, familiar yet exciting and above all--catchy as all get out.<br /><br />At times Natalia sounds a little bit too much like Gaga for comfort, but as a whole (especially the first half) Natalia takes the best of the current trends in music and puts her little touch on it. I think what I like most is that Natalia didn't get super crazy with the music or her voice just for the sake of being different. Her songs are melodic and very very addicting. This is guilt free pop. It's intelligent, catchy and it will probably be several months before you hear her on the radio--so go ahead and indulge.

1582701709|1.0|I would give this a minus if I could. Save your money. You will get nothing for your investment other than a bunch of babble and double talk.<br />Folks there is no free lunch in life and there is no one secret and that is the true secret. My wife got it from a friend. She said read this.<br /><br />I wanted to keep an open mind so I read it. If I had paid for it I would have asked for my money back.<br />Most motivational speakers /magic insight books are snake oil at best. The authors making a fortune preying on the hopeful, upset, and damaged human beings looking for comfort and reassurance but never doing anything of consequence themselves other than espousing babble as solutions for happiness and comfort. This Secret is the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />There is not one thing in this book that you can take away from your reading that is going to improve the quality of your life or make you happier. Nothing that will last longer than the reading the last page.<br /><br />Like most of these types of books, ( words without actions, false promises, and delusional simple untruths) someone claiming something that does not exist, but ideas that appeal to the human spirit in our darkest moments. Times we are lost and down. But sadly you will only be throwing your money away. Give it to charity instead.

B000LSR446|5.0|This album was the last of the classic seven from the Moody Blues from the period from 1967 to 1972.  It was also, like the 6 preceding it, different from the others. &#34;Seventh Sojourn&#34; is the most middle-of-the-road rock album of the bunch.  This album has very little progressive rock and no real experimentation.  The album is just plain, solid rock.<br /><br />The Moody Blues had become better and better at orchestrating their style of music throughout the six classic years period.  By the time they reached this album, they were fully mature in a rock style all their own and yet fitting with the times.  Looking back, it is difficult to see how they went from &#34;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour&#34; to this album. EGBDF was progressive rock with a fair amount of fantasy and science fiction. Seventh Sojourn is very down to earth, reflecting a more mundane and earthly orientation.<br /><br />The synthesizer is a fully matured instrument in &#34;Seventh Sojourn.&#34;  In the Moodies previous albums the mellotron was used for novelty and to enhance the unusual nature of their albums. In &#34;Seventh Sojourn&#34; the Chamberlain replaced the mellotron and became part of the orchestration. The use of the Chamberlain is sometimes so subtle that I find it difficult to know when the Chamberlain is used.<br /><br />With all these differences, the change to an earthly orientation, a middle-of-the-road rock sound, and a new instrument, you might worry that the album was so different that it is no longer true to the group.  Not correct in this case. When you listen to the classic 7 in order from &#34;Days of Future Passed&#34; to &#34;Seventh Sojourn,&#34; there is a feel of evolution, and perhaps, a feel of balance. Sometimes I become sad when I listen to this album because I know the group would never be the same group again. However, as we all know, the group has continued to evolve while trying hard to stay true to their roots. The results continually amaze me.<br /><br />Of the classic seven, this album is the least cohesive in terms of a common theme, and yet there are themes.  As noted earlier, the principal theme is the orientation back in the world as we know it. No dreams, no people from other planets helping us; merely a recognition that this is the place and time in which we live, and darn, while we wish it would be better, it's us that has to make it better and we can only do so much. What more of a theme do you need?<br /><br />This album is excellent.  The themes are excellent. The Moody Blues came back to earth and said: We aren't magic; we have to focus on the real world; we are just a rock and roll group, we are as lost as you are. These thoughts were sobering for those people that somehow thought the Moodies were gurus for a new world order. They were not and did not want to be. &#34;Seventh Sojourn&#34; is a reality check.<br /><br />Given all the positive comments about the album, which should be one of the best 100 rock albums of all time (and is not, according to those narrow-minded people at VH1), it does have one flaw: It is too short!  There are only 8 wonderful songs; two each from Mike Pinder, Justin Hayward, and John Lodge, one from Ray Thomas (&#34;For My Lady,&#34; my favorite Ray Thomas song from any album), and one that was a collaboration between Graeme Edge and Justin Hayward.<br /><br />&#34;Seventh Sojourn&#34; is the most polished of the classic seven, and ranks as one of the best Moody Blues albums by some people.  Of course, other people did not care for the melancholia and mundane topics and got all bummed out and gave it a bad review, which just goes to show, you can't please everyone all the time. I read one reviewer who hated &#34;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour&#34; and loved &#34;Seventh Sojourn.&#34; Another reviewer described EGBDF as being original and true to the group while &#34;Seventh Sojourn&#34; was too much pop and not the Moody Blues' best work. Who do you believe? Listen foryourself. When I'm in the right mood, this album is awesome. Other times I need something uplifting, and I listen to another group completely.<br /><br />All good groups generate controversy.  The Moody Blues are no exception (which by definition should make them a good group). They have always defined their own path in a unique way. &#34;Seventh Sojourn&#34; closed the first chapter in the story of The Moody Blues. Enjoy it for what it was and what it is: a good album by a good group.<br /><br />Enjoy!od groups generate controversy.

B0030HAJA6|5.0|I loved this book! I am a huge fan of the show Castle so being able to read the book that Castle is actually writing in the show is genius! It was very entertaining, a good mystery, and I still felt the banter and chemistry between Nikki Heat and Jameson Rook (Castle-Beckett). I would definitely recommend reading the book especially if you are a fan of the show, but it stands alone as well if you don't watch the show.

0385534639|2.0|\\"The Night Circus\\" talks a lot about magic.  It is deeply disappointing, then, that the novel contains so little magic itself.  While the first few pages showed some promise, the book quickly became plodding and boring.  It was difficult to care about the central characters because they were so poorly developed -- and their profound love for each other seemed so much to lack foundation so as to be unbelievable.  In addition, the descriptions of the purportedly magical circus itself were surprisingly earthbound.  Ironically, the most \\"earthbound\\" aspect of the novel was its greatest strength.  Only Bailey and the Murray twins were three-dimensional characters about whom a reader would care.  But their secondary storyline ended up dominating the book in terms of creating any sort of emotional response in a reader.  \\"The Night Circus\\" seemed to have a great deal of potential, but very little of it was ever realized.
0545123275|4.0|Like most praised YA books I figured this was yet another overrated book that recieved tons of praise because it was \\"different\\". I can say I was plesantly surprised. I'm not very versed in werewolf novels, but I felt this was a very well put together and thought out.<br /><br />The werewolves are different then others that I have read about. First off the fact that they are effected directly by the temperature is a very interesting concept and Stiefvater does a great job at making it work, she even includes the current temperature at the beginning of each chapter. The pack mentality and the way she explains the wolf's thoughts is also very nice and easy to understand. I don't want to spoil too much for anyone but the fact that the werewolves eventually loose themselves to the animal also makes this a very intense kind of read. Having those aspects put together you feel like the main character, Grace, at times. You become conscious of the temperature listed, and the fact that time is a factor so you feel the anxiety involved.<br /><br />The few complaints that I had were justifiable in the story and had nothing to do with the writing really. I wasn't fond of Grace's parents at all, I found them to be clueless and felt they had no business having a kid. I don't really like reading lyrics in books either and I skip them unless they are extremely important to the plot, so needless to say I glanced at them but didn't pay tremendous amounts of attention to them. They are good lyrics but I just don't enjoy trying to make music for something I've just read, I find it hard.<br /><br />I do recommend this book to others. It has a moment were sex occurs but it is done very tastefully and there is no detail involved, so there should still be somewhat of an age limit to this book i suppose I'd say 16+. If you enjoy the paranormal genre and werewolves I think you'll enjoy this a lot, it's a nice idea and it's worth reading. I'm looking forward to trying to find and read Linger.

This book is very well written and very interesting even to those who aren't aware that they even have an interest in this type of work. I would not hesitate in encouraging this book for someone else to read.
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|This isn't a bad book, but it's worth knowing what you're getting.    This book breaks no new ground. It isn't brilliant sci-fi or futurism; the setting and technologies are extremely trite extrapolations of the status quo. (Gas is more expensive; MMORPGs are more immersive; corporations are more powerful...but none of their roles are significantly different than they are in 2011.) This isn't a clever or intricate plot; it's a poor kid racing to solve video game puzzles to win a huge prize. The characters have no depth, and they don't undergo any substantial development; the villains are just plain evil, and the protagonists are classic Mary Sues. There are no deep themes or moral lessons; at best we get a \\"virtual reality is great, but maybe actual reality is kind of okay, too\\" tacked on at the end, completely unrelated to the rest of the plot.    What this is is a standard escapist tale for a very specific demographic. A poor fat virgin high-school student spends all his time in a MMORPG, has some success at an in-game contest, gets rich, gets in shape, becomes a hero (in the game and in real life), and gets the girl. It's (relatively) well-written. It's an easy read. If you liked National Treasure, The DaVinci Code, and World of Warcraft, then you'll probably enjoy it.    Hardly anything profound, but it does what it says on the tin.
B00479SVBU|3.0|After cancelling Sirus/XM (That'll teach them for cancelling Cinemagic :-),  I decided to find a way to listen to my MP3 player through the car radio.    This little unit does a fine job at a reasonable price.  As it turns out, there was no point in using my MP3 player at all, as all I had to do was load the songs onto a thumb drive and play away.    Sound quality?  It's good enough for me, but not nearly CD/FM quality.  In any case, I drive a noisy little sports car so very fine fidelity is wasted anyway.  However, I've found that some background noise and distortion is common.  Maybe I haven't found the right frequency yet.    Ease of use? The forward and back keys to the next song both require one click of a key.  Forward and back to the next folder/album require clicking the same keys as above, and just holding for 2 seconds.  If that's all you're doing, you'll be fine.    So why three stars?  Stupid annoyances.    Fist, the above mentioned background noise and distortion.  Maybe I'll find a better frequency, though.    Second, some features can only be easily accessed from the remote.  That's OK...It has more room for buttons.  But my remote is useless.  Sometimes it works...for a few clicks. Often, I have to continuously press a button, 20, 30 times or more before it registers.  At first I thought it might be a weak battery.  I bought a new battery but the results were the same.  I rarely try to use it anymore.    Third, Song order.  I can load the same files in my MP3 player and they'll play in order.  I'm not sure what determines the order on this player, but it works by different rules.     Also...The device can be turned off with a button, but for some inexplicable reason, it always automatically turns itself back on and starts playing through the files the next time you start the car, whether or not you want to listen.

1439107955|5.0|Author (doctor, researcher, professor) Siddartha Mukherjee took on a Herculean task in his attempt to cohesively piece together \\"a biography of cancer.\\" Anyone who makes the effort to read this book, which received the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction this year, knows that he succeeded swimmingly. Although daunted by its length (Amazon's Product Details put it at just over 600 pages-in fact, the main text comes in at about 470 with an additional 100 pages made up of the Acknowledgment, Notes, Selected Bibliography, Photo Credits, and Index), after waiting months for my turn at a library copy, I picked it up, plopped down (pen and paper in hand), to give it a go. Less than a week (and 20-8.5x11-sized pages of notes) later, I'd finished it, having learned a lot (though concepts became tougher to grasp with the increasingly complicated explanations in the latter third of the book) and immensely enjoyed doing so. In a generally chronological format, Dr. Mukherjee takes readers through the history of cancer, causes, preventions, research, researchers, treatments, funding, case histories, victories, defeats, statistics, his own views and pretty much everything you could possibly think of that has anything to do with this scary subject. Divided into six parts, it begins with the story of a 34-year-old mother who he, unsurprisingly, diagnoses with cancer, prescribes a treatment regime, and provides statistics on the cure rate for her condition. Readers may have nearly forgotten about her by the time he mentions her again (over 100 pages later) but will welcome occasional updates on her condition.<br /><br />The format for this \\"biography\\" is somewhat prescriptive but always engaging. The author  precedes each chapter with one to several interesting quotes (over 100 in all), titling them unusually (sometimes vaguely), such that readers won't necessarily initially understand what the titles mean. He introduces each researcher and/or individual relevant to the story by providing interesting information about them, then proceeds to explain what is needed to show their relevance. In the case of complicated concepts (like specifics about cancer cells and treatments), he details, in as layman-like terms as possible, what readers need to know in order to understand whatever idea he's trying to get across. Beyond the basic story are tangents aplenty (which I always love) especially about the patients, doctors and researchers whose individual contributions are important parts of cancer's biography. My advice: with so much information crammed into its many pages, your best bet is to just buy the book to use for future reference. I know I plan to. Subtitled \\"a biography of cancer\\" Mukherjee's treatise on the subject is extraordinary not only in its content but also in its telling. Also good: The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot, Mountains Beyond Mountains by Tracy Kidder and the Best Science Writing series.interesting information about them, then proceeds to explain what is needed to show their relevance.

B0058OUJA4|5.0|Similar to Hexdefense, ZDefense offers a simplistic tower defense game, my preferred type. This game has way more options than other tower games including tower types, game strategy, and being able to screenshot and share. I definitely benefited from the thorough tutorial provided in the beginning. I played through the first few rounds and only stopped due to sleep deprivation. Definitely worth the $1.99, but since it is free get it now. -HTC Incredible

B002BU0DPE|5.0|I bought these for myself for my XBox 360 after my X-11's cracked, (drunk brother probably stepped on those).  These are more durable than my X-11's, (swivel headphones); better and more sound adjustments, hyper bass boast, Dolby Digital connectable, and can give you the edge with all these options on the superior stereo sound when playing online.  You can tell when a player is creeping up on you and get the drop on them first.  The only drawback is it's still wired and my drunk brother still might trip on the wires, (but the wires are longer than the standard X360 controller charger cord).    Awesome if you can't afford the wireless upgraded versions of this headset.

1553655427|4.0|The argument certainly appears to be sound and pretty congruent with people like Garret Hardin, but the resistance against stopping the aid, given that we have very little if any evidence of its help, still seems insurmountable. I don't feel this part of the issue was fully addressed. Moyo, an African economist, does mention that there are huge economic issues tied into the aid givers themselves (jobs that would be lost if aid were eradicated) but that does not seem like a complex enough reason to resist what seems to be complete folly (guilt is also offered as an explanation).    However, Moyo's argument has ample support and some repetition. The book is quite small as it is but there is still excess. Having said that, there are times when she refers to an economic principle or a financial instrument without enough explanation for someone like myself who knows little about either.    What makes the book, perhaps, most worthwhile is her suggestions of what might work as an alternative to the aid movement. Some of her suggestions are already in place in small quantities (micro lending, unusual banking systems) and others would require a more massive shift in thinking and philosophy, not to mention a complete renovation of the current system of power in many AFrican states that thrive on the aid money.

0142418471|3.0|This is corny and charming. The story of best friends, Will Grayson (aloof loner, afraid to connect with anyone) and Tiny (an enormous gay young man) who are trying to find love in highschool (Will through avoiding everyone and Tiny through having a relationship with everyone). The story does a good job of weaving the parallel lines of this desire in both boys (and the third character, the other Will Grayson) as they also attempt to keep their own friendship despite their self absorption and differences. It is the relationship between the two boys that I found most compelling. How hard it is to pursue the desire for love but also keep friendships.     The goofiness is that there is another will grayson, one who is also gay, who ends up as one of Tiny's many boyfriends; and Tiny is writing and putting on a musical that is really goofy about his life and love. The lyrics of many of the songs are included (much to my dismay). But, it does make you laugh. At the end, there is what is supposed to be a powerful scene during Tiny's play about identity which left me both irritated and wondering, what the heck?  But ultimately, the boys friendship prevails and that saves the book from being just goofy.
B0010AN7Z4|4.0|After working with Jack Lemon in the highly successful Some Like It Hot (1959), writer/director Billy Wilder and writer I.A.L. Diamond were anxious to work with Lemon on another project.  The result was The Apartment (1960), co-written by Wilder and Diamond, and directed and produced by Wilder.  The film was nominated for multiple Academy Awards, and won best picture with Wilder winning best director, and Wilder and Diamond winning for best screenplay.  In addition, Jack Lemon and co-star Shirley MacLaine were nominated for best actor and actress respectively, but each did not win.<br /><br />The Apartment, may have caught the fancy of audiences at the time, because of the rather risqu&eacute; theme involving an apartment that is used as a \\"love nest\\", by employees of an insurance company.  Back then, when living together, premarital sex, and divorce, were generally frowned upon, this concept was somewhat racy.  While the film has some wonderful performances, and still has great charm and warmth, some of its impact has probably been lost due to the evolution of morals.<br /><br />Jack Lemon plays Bud Baxter a low level clerk in an insurance company, who through a series of circumstances, finds his apartment being used as a rendezvous for some of his superiors in the company, who take turns using his pad to entertain their dates for the evening.<br /><br />His neighbors mistakenly believe that he is a playboy, but Baxter actually has no love life, although he is attracted to Fran Kubelik (MacLaine), an elevator operator in his building.  Baxter is called in to see Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray), a top executive in the company, who it turns out would also like to use the apartment for some hanky panky, in return for future favors.<br /><br />The relationship then becomes a triangle, as Ms. Kubelik is Sheldrake's mistress (the latest of many).  While alone at Baxter's apartment, a despondent Fran swallows some sleeping pills.  Fortunately, Baxter arrives in time to save her life, calling his neighbor (Jack Kruschen) who is a doctor.  Baxter hides his feelings, while trying to be a both a friend to Fran, and loyal to Sheldrake.  Sheldrake's past comes back to bite him, but just when it appears that he may have won Fran back, he's left to celebrate the new year alone.<br /><br />The screenplay is well written, with few wasted scenes.  Tailored to Jack Lemon's shaky and slightly neurotic acting style, playing the trampled on and conflicted Bud Baxter, is a predictably nice fit.  Lemon and Shirley MacLaine work very well together, and have some great dialog, in an understated MacLaine performance.  Fred MacMurray (My Three Sons) is also excellent, playing a man with a long history of using people.<br /><br />Very much of its time, The Apartment has the quaint charm and innocence from an era that has long since faded into the past.  Those seeing it for the first time now, might even wonder why it was selected as Best Picture, some fifty years ago.  While some films easily translate through the years, with the vast changes in personal morality, The Apartment may not be one of them.  Time may have put some tarnish on its luster, but it's clear even today why The Apartment has retained its appeal.bor (Jack Kruschen) who is a doctor.

1934030198|5.0|This is an awesome book.  But, it is INCREDIBLY detailed and thorough.  It took me a few weeks of reading and taking notes and making plans to get through, but I finally felt like I understood triathlon training and planning a training period...be it a week, 6 months or a year.    Before reading this I would get a training plan online, or from a friend, try to personalize it a bit, follow it and do ok.  But, after signing up for an Ironman and not wanting to shell out the $$$$$ for a coach to make sure I got through the year injury free and ready to race, I got this book.  It's amazing.  It goes through planning the year up to your race in great detail....hours per year, per week, training phases for running, swimming, biking, weight lifting, cross training and resting to make sure that you peak at the perfect time for your race.  It has workouts, drills, tips...if you learn well from a book, it's almost like having a coach.    He has special sections for women, novices, masters, youth and elite racers; injury prevention and treatment, etc.    That said, this book could be incredibly overwhelming if you've never done a multi-sport race or training before, or if you're not into planning/organizing.  If you're more the go-out-and-do-it kind of person, this book isn't for you.    However, as someone who struggles with the \\"Am I Ready?!  Can I Really Do This!?\\" anxiety, especially on race day, this book has very much calmed me down...I know that on the day, I'll be as prepared as possible and ready to go.
031237593X|4.0|Following the reign of Edward IV and Richard the III, Penman does a wonderful job of weaving history and narrative. Penman portrays Edward as a once grand and thoughtful king whose downfall is hurried by his greedy, power hungry, vindictive wife and her family (Elizabeth). Richard, in contrast, is all that is possibly good in a potential King and a foil to Edward.     This is a controversial history because Richard (of Shakespeare fame) has historically had a bad reputation. Penman sees little historical proof for this perspective and Richard becomes a man who is ultimately felled by his own goodness. While the history is interesting, what Penman is good at is weaving a compelling story around characters who are complex and interesting
B00000F5KH|5.0|At the time of writing, 90 of 115 reviewers have awarded this movie 5 stars. They cannot all be wrong, but many are right for the wrong reasons, classically an estimate of the number of sodden handkerchiefs you will have to toss into the laundry when it is all over. There is no doubting or denying the emotional power of this movie, but it is a power that comes as much from the intellectual and artistic brilliance of its creator and director, Walter Salles, as from the heart-rending performances of its two protagonists who have reluctantly come together across a chasm 50 years wide.<br /><br />First to Salles. His script reads like a game of chess. The different moves made by the ageing hag, Dora, and the engaging but brutish young Josue are played out in an exciting counterpoint that brings a check-mate or a stale-mate perilously close on one occasion after another right to the very end, that I will not divulge. How this see-saw of fortunes over a 113 minute screening could be too long and too boring for some reviewers beats me: maybe they permanently need a continuous infusion of amphetamines to keep them alert. The camera work and the editing are exceptional. The entire narrative is built through a series of confrontations that are brutally cut to speed the momentum. Within each, we have animated close-ups that are riveting, often of fascinating side-shows that are not essential to the plot but add greatly to what the film gives us: a stunning lesson in the sociology and anthropology of this enormously misunderstood country and the society that has emerged from its very varied population. Searing pictures of husbands, wives, lovers, dictating their wildest dreams and hopes to the callous scribe, Dora, who will probably toss the letters for which she is handsomely paid into the waste-basket, leap from the screen. One such, from Josue's mother to the boy's father who may or may not still be living in a village thousands of miles from Rio that they left several years earlier, keeps resurfacing like a leitmotif  at crucial points in the plot. It is the search for this village and this person that provides the main skeleton of the plot, in a journey that allows us to become acquainted with the starkly awesome interior of the country and the poverty, ignorance, and incredible superstition of its inhabitants. The latter characteristic is vividly depicted during an orgiastic religious celebration that calls to mind another celebrated Brazilian movie: Marcel Camus' BLACK ORPHEUS. To a relatively simple and potentially sentimental story, Salles has brought a level of cynicism and sophistication that at times can be breathless. The motives and desires of Dora and Josue, and even of peripheral characters such as the kindly lorry driver they encounter, can change almost without warning and yet when you think about it, they are the outcome of guilt, resentment, fear, and remorse that are perfectly logical and should never have surprised us in the first place. There is nothing manipulative in any of these twists and turns, because the chemistry that creates the action is deep inside the characters all along. In other words, this is not a film to weep about, but one to THINK about. But weep if you must. There is enough sadness, joy, despair and hope in this 113 minutes to stimulate every emotion in our being, and it is beautifully epitomised by the closing sequence of Josue growing smaller and smaller as he runs towards the receding bus, and then large again in the very last close-up shot.<br /><br />Visually, this transfer offers excellent sharpness and crisp subtitles in English. You don't HAVE to put up with the commentary although I found it quite perceptive. The musical sound track is exemplary: almost minimalistic, but welcome when it is present, unlike that of BLACK ORPHEUS that nearly drove me crazy. My single grouch is that the Special Features on the Menu of my Columbia-Tristar DVD offered me only the trailer instead of the advertised interviews and biographies; but I made on attempt to return my copy. Even without these features, whatever they are, there is enough great film-making and acting to justify describing the $8 cost of this DVD as one of the best bargains around.erviews and biographies; but I made on attempt to return my copy.

B0035G02MW|4.0|Lodge's novel is both poignant and funny, especially for those of us who are going to be shopping for our own hearing aids soon. The novel is lively, engaging and a fast read (the introduction of the crazy grad student, Alex, writing her dissertation on suicide notes is less than realistic and somewhat trite but it does add some humor).    Desmond is going deaf and can't hear half the conversations he engages in. He meets Alex in one of these conversations where she asks for advice and a meeting and he doesn't know what she's saying so he just nods his head. But the story is about how he copes with aging in his relationship with his wife and his father. His wife is somewhat younger and this relationship is not very well developed perhaps because the novel is told from a dear diary perspective and Desmond is self absorbed.     His relationship with his father is more finely drawn and we can understand and empathize with both of them: Desmond as he tries to do the right thing but feels torn by the boredom, semi-craziness, and chaos of his father's life as he deteriorates; and the father trying to be independent and yet still be involved in his son's life

0807014273|4.0|I had mixed reactions to this book that I've been meaning to read for years. If I understand the therapy correctly, Frankly advocates for the importance of meaning in each individual's life and that most pyschological illness comes from a lack of meaning (or meaningful meaning). Logotherapy, Frankl's approach and known as the third Vienna school of Psychotherapy--after Freud and Adler) focuses on approaching meaning in the client's life. One of the main ways meaning is expressed is through our suffering. Suffering, from Frankl's perspective is a \\"good\\" thing, or, at the least, necessary. I do kind of agree with this, not that it provides \\"meaning\\" necessarily, but that life is not really lived without some suffering (which seems counter to the Buddhist stuff, which I kind of agree with too--I guess they can be combined with the idea of acceptance of suffering . . .).    The first part of the book is focused on Frankl's horrific experiences in the concentration camps and how those that survived did so by accepting their suffering and seeing how the suffering itself provided their existence with meaning (this part of the book is not really convincing to me. I see how Frankl has interpreted the world this way, but I don't see that this is a universal theory). The second half is somewhat more interesting, exploring what it does mean for people to suffer. One therapeutic approach is facing that which you fear which is a fairly common approach to fears.

B002ZG981E|2.0|I've been a Christopher Nolan fan since \\"Following.\\" But I'm disappointed that such an obviously smart director has so quickly allowed himself to be assimilated into the Hollywood blockbuster mentality. Granted, he does the mega-budget, computer-graphic, eye-candy movie better than most, but he could be doing less expensive & more interesting films. \\"Inception\\" is just ok (though numbingly familiar) to look at--for about an hour. Then, if you're inclined toward concise, engaging & original films that do a lot within a small space--such as classic noirs or eccentric but really fascinating art films like \\"Fallen Angels\\" or \\"Last Life in the Universe\\"--this is hard to sit through. It's much longer than it needs to be, and clumsily confusing--despite stopping the narrative every now & then to explain what's happening & whose dream we're in, which tells you there isn't total confidence in the viewer. Or in the movie itself. Finally, I didn't really care whether I was in a dream within a dream within a dream--or just dreaming I was at the movies. Nor did I particularly care about the sentimental idea of getting back to his real-life kids. (Or, hey, do they even exist? Wow!) Being a cinephile of sorts (ok, I dislike the term too), many friends I've talked with who have a similarly broad, extensive experience with film have agreed. (Read David Denby's review in \\"The New Yorker,\\" which nails the pretensions & problems here.) It's a kids' film, a flashy but cheesy puzzle film, and finally a shaggy spinning-top story. Who cares if the \\"reality token\\" keeps spinning or topples? I waited this long & then Nolan won't tell me?  Not that it mattered at that point. I was just happy to have done my cultural duty & was free to return to a world that, dream or not, is far more interesting than \\"Inception.\\"

B002ZG99G8|4.0|THE LOSERS is anything but. Created to appear like a comic book in motion, writers peter Berg, James Vanderbuilt and Andy Diggle have come up with a script that has defined some strong, unforgettable characters, outlined an all over the place story line, and managed to polish it all off with just the right amount of parody, humor, steamy scenes, and silly dialogue that makes the movie work.  It is a film highly dependent of pyrotechnics and special effects, but these also are pulled off in such a way that they, too, are entertaining an even set the audience to cheering.<br /><br />The story comes across as a bit jumbled due to the many sites where the action takes place, but essentially it is the tale of a group of five men (CIA operatives) who in an attempt to save some children in a fated helicopter escape from a disaster in Bolivia instead are assumed dead when the report of the exploded helicopter reaches the US.  The five men toss their dog tags into the flaming ruins of the helicopter and thus become lost to the world.  The team is a talented and well trained unit and each of the members has a special identity and gift: Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is the leader (and womanizer), Roque (Idris Alba) is the brains, Jensen (Chris Evans) is the wildly funny guy, Pooch (Columbus Short) is the sensitive guy, and Cougar (&Oacute;scar Jaenada) is the sniper with the ever present hat.  The team (the Losers) becomes the target of a betrayal in dealing with one Max (Jason Patric) who is preparing the bomb to end all bombs.  Out of nowhere comes the mysterious Aisha (Zoe Saldana) who works her way into the group via Clay's attraction to her beauty.  But Aisha has her own agenda and the team joins her in uncovering and hopefully destroying the lethal Max who is planning global warfare.  There are unexpected twists in the plot and internal challenges to the team's structure, but it all comes round in the end.<br /><br />Yes, this is yet another noisy action film with classy acting from not only the stars but from everyone in the large cast.  It is a hoot of an action thriller and hopefully this cast will be reassembled for a Part II in the future.  Grady Harp, August 11stars but from everyone in the large cast.

0553801473|1.0|What a train wreak!  I wondered if the last book was a mistake.  Now, I see it was part of a trend -- a downward spiral into nothing.  I am officially done with this boring slog.

Most reviews were positive, with over half of the ratings in the 4 and 5 region.  Then there were over a third of them in the 1 and 2 region...and only FOUR rated it in the middle, a 3.  The audience either loved it or hated it, and...<br /><br />I really enjoyed it myself.<br /><br />I thought it had a nice, gritty approach, with the emphasis on a single platoon's encounters with their portion of alien invaders.  Handheld cameras, soot, dirt, grainy shots, chaotic action...it seemed much more realistic than I was expecting.  As one of the interviewed actors said, it was  a war film that happened to have aliens in it.<br /><br />When  people claim it was like \\"Independence Day\\" I have to disagree.  Certainly there were similarities, but heck, they're both alien invasion films.  I thought it shared more similarities with \\"District 9\\" actually; both were similar in technical approaches (see the preceding paragraph), and both emphasized a plot that was about a problem that also happened to include aliens....in \\"District 9\\" the subject was immigration.<br /><br />(And I think holding \\"Independence Day\\" up as a bastion of All That Is Great in Sci-Fi is faulted, by the way.  Really, think about it: almost any individual aspect of that movie was pretty bad: the cliches ran overtime, what with Randy Quaid,  and Judd Hirsch... and what about that ridiculous scene where Will Smith hijacks a helicopter to his old base, where his fiance just HAPPENS to be waiting WITH the President's wife?)<br /><br />I felt this movie did a fine job emphasizing the smaller, more personal aspects of battle, rather than the grand D-Day approach of thousands of men and dozens of personalitiies.  While Aaron Eckart's character (Sgt. Nantz) had a pretty timeworn problem--in that he was a warrior facing the end of his 'useful' days--I felt he did a terrific job of infusing the role with the hoorah! of the marine, and the characters serving under him came off as authentic as well.  There were hardly any really name actors in this film, and I think that made this more genuine, too.<br /><br />The action was constant, from the moment the troop helicopter touched down in L.A.  There was almost no let up, and I don't need a spoiler warning to tell you that a good deal of the cast in the beginning of the movie isn't around at the curtain call.  And those that are around at the end look pretty beat up, scraped up, and worn...not like those old movies where John Wayne's uniform wasn't even dirty at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Special effects were terrific, as one is coming to expect nowadays, and the movie incorporated a pretty solid alien enemy, keeping them hidden and mysterious for a good deal of the film, then letting us in on them bit by bit.  One of the \\"meatier\\" moments involved probing an alien's body in a scene that goes a good deal further than waterboarding, which I thought would receive at least a little more of a reaction from the general public--it was certainly worse than anything Jack Bauer did in \\"24.\\"  But I guess it's one of those things that we would shout out about were it an enemy soldier who also happened to be human.<br /><br />Watch this film, and try to think of it in terms or what it is: a war film.

B004YEJGEO|3.0|This looks like an interesting game, but I uninstalled it very quickly. It's supposed to be light, but it uses red, blue, and yellow as the primary colors. Those are not the primary colors of light, and this is quite bothersome. Red, blue and green are the primary colors of light (red and green make yellow). Pretty basic flaw.
B00005S6K8|3.0|I actually enjoyed this version of Sabrina much more than I did the original. Maybe because this one was more real. You understood why Sabrina went to Paris. The reason she went flowed through out the movie and made much better sense than the original. Good chick flick. ;)
030788743X|1.0|I'm really surprised that so many people have rated this book so highly.    Have people actually read the book or are they simply presuming it's good based on snazzy cover art and the notion that liking temporarily-relevant books garners them some kind of Amazon customer review street cred?    The concept is good, but the writing is designed to appeal to those who think that a vuvuzela is a subtle way to support the home team . The author uses an astounding number of clichés - I've seen DMVs put together with more imagination. The writing here is about on par with a freshman year Creative Writing class at Arizona State.    So many of the 80s references are jammed in at embarrassing angles and seem to want the reader to smile knowingly and exclaim, \\"Oh my Gosh! That was from the 80s! I was alive in the 80s! How clever is this!\\"    Again, the concept is interesting, but I just don't understand how this got through an editor, unless that editor was blind, fingerless and perhaps died in the Spanish Inquisition.

0385534639|3.0|This is one of the most anticipated books of the year- its author received a pretty massive advance from Doubleday and the rights to the movie adaptation have already been purchased by the makers of Twilight (EEK).  I generally am wary of hype and am nearly always wary of novels about the circus.  But the cover on this one was too great to resist!    The Night Circus is about two magicians, Celia and Marco, who are in magical competition with each other a la The Prestige.  But they are not entirely in control of the game, and each move they make impacts many, many people.  What starts as a competition soon becomes almost a series of magical love letters before things take a dangerous turn when lives start becoming disrupted.    I can see why the movie rights to this book were snatched up so quickly- it is a very visual book and I can see people biting at the chomp to see the actual night circus, full of wonders and marvels, brought to life (probably in IMAX 3-D).  But while the descriptions of the circus were beautiful, and the secondary characters fascinating, I just didn't get much emotion at all from the two main characters, Celia and Marco.  They are supposed to be madly in love with each other, so much so that the earth seems to tremble every time they touch.  But through the whole story, I didn't feel as though I really KNEW them.  For example, Celia is a quiet and sad child, but somehow grows up to be witty and confident, making suggestive jokes at dinner parties and delighting everyone.  Marco is a lonely child who becomes a charming young adult, but when he becomes interested in Celia, he just seems a little TOO intense for it to be real for me.  When did these evolutions happen?  With such stunning visual descriptions of everything else in this book, I felt like the main characters should have been fleshed out more and then maybe their love story would have taken on more meaning for me.    But even though the main characters didn't do the heavy lifting this story required, in my opinion, the side characters (particularly the clockmaker and Chandresh) were excellent and so wonderfully portrayed.  When combined with the beautiful and riveting descriptions of the night circus itself, they really carry the story and kept me interested and engaged the whole way through.

0307386171|5.0|In this sad, yet poignant tale, we slowly watch the happiness of this newly married couple slip away.<br /><br />The beginning paragraphs offer up a clue as to the root of their problems--sexual inexperience and lack of communication.  But in the pages that follow, we see how the two met, how they gradually reached the point of marriage, and that the seeds of their future discontent sprouted long before that fateful night.<br /><br />I liked the author's style of gradually unfolding the actual events of that night:  from the opener, followed by the courtship in its various stages, until finally we see the disaster on Chesil Beach.<br /><br />The author then gifts the reader with the \\"near misses\\" of their lives afterwards, and we cannot help but wish that somehow, the two of them would find each other again--improved by age, wisdom, and experience.  But alas....there is no happy ending here.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000YJ6736 On Chesil Beach]] could be a cautionary tale for those who would ignore or choose not to engage in serious communication in the beginning of a relationship.  But the time period (pre-sexual revolution) is an indicator of why and how these two failed at this task.<br /><br />Five stars.

B0036S4C6G|4.0|I decided to give this book a chance, since it kept popping up on my Amazon page as a recommendation for me, and the title kept catching my eye. I don't usually like books that bounce around from character to character and don't have a traditional, cohesive, orderly plot (even though I like to imagine I'm fun and spontaneous, my taste in reading says otherwise, I guess). Anyways, maybe it was my low expectations for the book, but it ended being much better than I thought it would be. In fact, it ended up being really, really good. Egan is a strong writer who creates characters with depth and complexity, and the stories flow from one person to the next. It is an effortless transition into each person's story, and you can't help but become engaged from the start.

0446677450|5.0|Kiyosaki does a tremendous job simplifying the seemingly complicated dynamics of money. He does make it sound easy, but like many of the countless analogies he uses, it just takes a little practice, experience, and motivation to start. Like riding a bicycle or playing baseball, after a while you get the hang of it and it will \\"look easy\\" to others not familiar with the many opportunities that could have money work for you.<br /><br />That's the motiff throughout the book: finding ways to make money work for you. He begins with an explanation of how he had two dads, one whose rich and one poor (biological). Kiyosaki does a seamless job comparing the two dads he had growing up, drawing comparisons and contrasts as the book progresses. It gives the reader an idea of characteristics that tend to come with the wealthy and the poor.<br /><br />Some of the topics that he covers are : myths about money, the traditional view that getting good grades and finding a job to work for money isn't enough, taxes and the secrets of the rich, and of course, his tips and mentalities as to how to have money work for you.<br /><br />I found myself easily going through the chapters. He writes with a very colloquial tone, friendly almost. He really wants you to understand the concepts, perhaps change some of your habits, and if you not, pass on some knowledge and wisdom about money to your children. He speaks with a lot of wisdom, and again, he makes real estate investing, stocks, and owning corporations and business sound very easy. That's not much of an issue though, because he encourages you to start somewhere and take smart, educated risks.<br /><br />In the end, I'm left reading this book with a feeling of inspiration, knowledge, and an \\"ah-ha\\" moment. The financial intelligence he refers to in his book is all within us. We've just got to break some old habits (if not, just stick with some safer decisions), learn about investment opportunities, don't listen to everyone who tells you otherwise, and to start somewhere. After you've read this book, your journey isn't finished. He advises that you learn as much as you can and take smart risks.<br /><br />Well written book, great narrative and insight, and definitely a life-changing type of a book. You will feel invigorated and ready to take your life to the next step.e. After you've read this book, your journey isn't finished.

1594744769|4.0|I picked this up because of the great reviews and the interesting pictures and once i started reading it i could not put it down. Its amazing way its written just flows from one idea to the other creating these vivid pictures in your mind but then theres the actual photos which help with these fantastic characters. theres a creepy element to it as well making u want to turn page after page to see what happens.  the only thing that i found was that i was a little disappointed with the ending, with the way the book led up to it  i thought there should have been more. I love reading about the future mixing with the past, and would have love to have read more of that especially the house as it was in ruins.    other than that ive recommended it to every one that i know that loves to read and prob will never get my copy. thank you for this great read!
B003BLCKSU|5.0|After slowly then fully falling in love with the first album I was indeed slightly disappointed by their second endeavor. But as with the first after listening to many times Amys vocals become clearer and more defined and the music becomes less muddled and more sophisticated. I am again truly amazed by Amy and her band. Although I am 55 years old I cannot believe this group has not become even more popular than they are, especially in the USA. I truly believe that their talent can easily take them into the realms of the best of the best of Rock and Roll! I haven't loved any group as much since the days of the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Yes, Stones and on and on and on..
B001IBIQU6|4.0|Been listening to this for a while, I didn't care for most of it when I first bought it but time made it better (Ultra took a while to grow on me as well, although I like it better than this).     I am giving this fours stars, because sub-par DM is better than most other music out there, and also because Wrong is that good. I think DM's first album (too poppy) and Exciter (terrible production) are worse than this one. I am also going to go so far as to say that what they are missing right now is Alan Wilder, because when he was with them he did all the quality pre-production that would have made up for some of the lack of quality production since he left (before he left, there was no such thing as hit or miss with these guys). Given that, they still turn out some amazing stuff despite the revolving cast of producers.    Also, like me, many of the posters are big fans of DM, we might be biased but also might be most critical. What is interesting about this album is that when you read through all the reviews, the songs one reviewer likes are the ones another reviewer doesn't like.    Breaking it down by track:    In Chains - I don't really care for the first two tracks, I know a lot of other people like them but I find myself losing interest by the halfway point. Maybe time will make me want to listen to them.    Hole to Feed - See above    Wrong - Between non traditional song-writing, gradual progression in musical layers and perfectly crafted hooks, you can't go wrong with Wrong.    Fragile Tension - All I think of when I think of this song is the bassline, it defines the song, and it's amazing.    Little Soul - This is a odd song, which is why it's my second favorite on the album. Reminds me a little (but not entirely) of the oddity of Shame and Shouldn't Have Done That, I miss when DM did stuff that was so different from anything I had ever heard.    In Sympathy - This song kind of reminds me of some of the other New Wave bands of the eighties, which should botherme I suppose (DM was different), but I like this song despite, or perhaps because of that.    Peace - First few times I heard this song I thought, sounds like Erasure. Over time, I got over that first impression, it's my #3 pick for the album. It's got a pretty epic feel to it, builds to the chorus, comes back down, builds higher, adds more Martin Gore harmony as it goes, good song.    Come Back - This song feels like a Dave Gahan solo effort, other than his voice it doesn't really sound like DM to me. However, I like it, the way the lyrics transition to the chorus, sort of an atmospheric quality to it, hard to put into words why I like it.    Spacewalker - Odd little instumental, fits the album but not remarkable, I skip it.    Perfect - This song starts out with a cool tick tick tick beat/sound and then goes in a less intersting direction for me. I still like it though.    Miles Away/The Truth is - This song is dark, and DM is known for darkness, so it's a welcome element. Good song, good bass line, Dave is a pretty decent writer really.    Jezebel - This one is not for me, though it is a bit quirky like Little Soul, it reminds me of sitting in a cheesy lounge somewhere wishing I was somewhere else.    Corrupt - This one is mostly unremarkable to me, but sometimes I dont mind listening through it anyway. The odd intrumental version of Wrong at -.41 before the end is worth listening to though.

Also if your phone is not downloading the game, or any other game for that matter, don&apos;t down rate the game! you&apos;re most likely doing something wrong.<br /><br />-This game plays fairly close to an iOS game called GeoDefense in which I did buy long ago.

A nice, funny and engaging film despite a fairly   hum-drum first 30 minutes or so; a decent road   movie with an abundance of clichéd characters   and fairly littered with cinematic and televisual   allusions which all combined in the mix to wile   away an amusing 90 minutes or so.

0439597404|4.0|According to Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi, the text of this story was left for them by three mystery kids.<br /><br />With that stab at blurring the boundaries between fantasy and reality, these two authors slip easily into a haunted house tale that rapidly blossoms into a story of hidden fae and strange creatures. The first of the Spiderwick Chronicles -- \\"The Field Guide\\" -- is a staggering brief story that sets up mysteries, marvels and everything that come after.<br /><br />After their parents' divorce, the Grace kids -- teenage Mallory and nine-year-old twins Jared and Simon -- move with their mother to a crumbling old Victorian house, owned by a weird old aunt. Jared is having a rough time with all of this, but he's distracted from his personal woes by a \\"squirrel\\" scuttling around inside the walls. And their investigations reveal a strange little stash of items that were obviously not taken by a squirrel.<br /><br />An exploratory trip in a dumbwaiter takes Jared to a hidden library full of strange books on mythic creatures -- and soon strange things start happening to the family. Jared's further investigations uncover a strange little book called \\"Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide To The Fantastical World Around You,\\" a little guide to faery creatures. Jared begins to believe that the unbelievable might be true -- that there are faeries causing trouble in his new home -- but his siblings are a bit more reluctant.<br /><br />For the record, \\"The Field Guide\\" is a short book in a short series full of short books. It's only about a hundred pages of heavily-illustrated text, and we're not talking large pages. It's more like the first chapters of a longer novel -- and it ends on a bit of a cliffhanger.<br /><br />But Holly Black's writing style definitely makes it worth reading. Though the storyline is pretty simple, she weaves a web of subtle, eerie strangeness around the seemingly ordinary circumstances, and builds an increasing sense of dusty, leaf-strewn age around the house. And despite the Victorian house, the sprites and faery creatures here are anything but Victorian -- sometimes ugly, bizarre or malicious (such as when Mallory's hair is tied to her bed).<br /><br />And Tony DiTerlizzi's artwork is simply perfect for the story that he and Black are telling. He crafts lots of intricate pen-and-ink drawings, shadowy depictions of the decayed Victorian mansion, and illustrations of the weirder aspects of the Spiderwick estate (like the dusty library, or the vaguely Satanic door-knocker). The highlights are the old scribbled-on papers of Arthur Spiderwick, including a picture of a household boggart.<br /><br />The main characters are also quite believable: Mallory is a loving but slightly brittle teenager, and the mom is clearly struggling to stay afloat after her divorce. And the twins Jared and Simon (who can be told apart by their hairstyles) make good protagonists for the book, especially since they're so different -- Simon is a tidy animal enthusiast, while the more prominent Jared is a kid who is starting to sink into trouble after his parents' divorce.<br /><br />\\"The Field Guide\\" is a good opening chapter for the Spiderwick Chronicles, building up a sense of suspense, eerie fantasy and otherworldly creatures.

B004SJAZCC|1.0|Love Lesson From Twilight #4,267: \\"Love\\" turns all guys into controlling jerks who don't do anything except compete to see whose dingdong is bigger.<br /><br />Sadly that's most of what's going on in \\"Twilight: Eclipse.\\" It's the best of the series thus far, mainly because some underdeveloped characters get some backstory and there are some interesting action scenes... but the movie is smothered in a thick coating of phlegmlike teen angst, whining and bickering. It gets to the point where you WISH the bad guys would arrive.<br /><br />In summary: Edward (Robert Pattinson) is pestering Bella (Kristen Stewart) to marry him. Bella doesn't want to because (boohoo) her parents are divorced and marriage is dead to her, but she DOES want to become a vampire. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) wants Bella to dump Edward and be with him instead.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the evil Victoria is raising an army of newborn vampires to come to Forks and kill Bella. Yes, seriously -- she raised an entire army to kill ONE bland human teenager. Not the Cullens, or the people of Forks. Just Bella. And since the entire universe revolves around Bella, both the werewolves and the Cullens are desperate to protect her. So they overcome centuries of mutual hatred and join forces to protect her.<br /><br />I will admit it: \\"Twilight Eclipse\\" is easily the best movie in this series... which is like saying that a pinch is less unpleasant than a poke in the eye. Amazingly, there are actually some taut, fast-paced scenes here, as well as some creepy eerie scenes involving the newborn army (like their too-briefly glimpsed mayhem in Seattle).<br /><br />Too bad that isn't what the plot is REALLY about. Instead, we're battered with a bad teen soap opera -- lots of heavy breathing, kissing, whining, and romantic estrangements that last about two minutes. The dialogue is painfully vapid (\\"You love him.\\" \\"I love you more.\\" \\"I know\\"), and the director seems to be desperately trying to come up with some kind of plot other than Edward and Jacob being emo jerks.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart gives her usual one-note performance -- dead eyes, masklike face and a monotone voice. And the insipid Bella just drifts through the movie, more of a living MacGuffin than a heroine. It's hard to see why not one but TWO boys would be ready to die for a boring girl who just sits there breathing through her large front teeth.<br /><br />Robert Pattinson is pretty obviously just here for for his paycheck, while Taylor Lautner gives it his best effort. Unfortunately his character has turned into a controlling jerk to rival Edward, and the two male leads have more sexual chemistry with each other (the tent scene) than with the leaden Stewart. In fact, the only decent character development is given to Jasper and Rosalie, and seeing their backstories (especially Rosalie's bloodthirsty bride rampage) makes them richer and more intriguing than our bland protagonists.<br /><br />\\"Twilight Eclipse\\" is the best movie of the Twilight series.... which isn't saying much. It has some good moments, but those are smothered by all the teen soapiness.jerks.     Kristen Stewart gives her usual one-note performance -- dead eyes, masklike face and a monotone voice.

Robert Pattinson is pretty obviously just here for for his paycheck, while Taylor Lautner gives it his best effort. Unfortunately his character has turned into a controlling jerk to rival Edward, and the two male leads have more sexual chemistry with each other (the tent scene) than with the leaden Stewart. In fact, the only decent character development is given to Jasper and Rosalie, and seeing their backstories (especially Rosalie's bloodthirsty bride rampage) makes them richer and more intriguing than our bland protagonists.     \\"Twilight Eclipse\\" is the best movie of the Twilight series.... which isn't saying much. It has some good moments, but those are smothered by all the teen soapiness.

B003ERQWD0|5.0|Nobody can drench a book in creepy, dank atmosphere like Neil Gaiman, infused with humor and more than a little horror.<br /><br />Fortunately that flavour is kept alive in the movie adaptation of \\"Coraline,\\" brought to life by the talented Henry Selick. It's a haunting little dark fairy tale full of decayed apartments, dancing rats and eerie soulless doppelgangers, as well as a gutsy heroine who finds herself in this ominous \\"other\\" world.<br /><br />Newly moved into an aged apartment, Coraline (Dakota Fanning) is bored. Her parents are too busy to do anything with her, and her neighbors are either insane or boring. The one exception is Wybie, a boy who annoys her no end.<br /><br />It's the sort of relentlessly dull world that any little girl would want to escape from -- until Coraline does. She encounters a plastered-up door and a colourful wormhole, leading to a doppelganger of new home. In fact, it's so similar that she has a button-eyed \\"other mother\\" (Teri Hatcher) and matching \\"other father,\\" (John Hodgman) as well as great food, games, a shimmering magic garden, a chorus of circus rodents and magic toys.<br /><br />At first Coraline is fascinated by the other world, especially since her other parents are as attentive as her real ones aren't. Then she finds her real parents sealed inside a mirror. With the help of a sarcastic cat, Coraline ventures back into the other world. But with her parents and a trio of dead children held hostage, Coraline's only hope is to gamble with her own freedom -- and she'll be trapped forever if she fails.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's book \\"Coraline\\" is a brilliant dark fairy-tale vibe -- decayed apartments, dead children, spiderwebs, beetles, disembodied hands, button eyes, and an insectile button-eyed woman who wants to claim Coraline for herself. It's a fairy tale world that turns into a nightmare realm where souls are lost and horrific things scuttle in the shadows.<br /><br />Most directors would turn the story into a cutsy, unscary affair... but not the director of \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach.\\" Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon). And it's full of lovely details that could have been silly (the creepy-crawly claw hand) yet work brilliantly.<br /><br />The story starts off as merely surreal, but grows more ghastly and eerie as the movie unwinds -- and in the last third, the slow-moving story suddenly spins into a thoroughly spooky territory, and a truly terrifying climax where the Other Mother shows her true self. And along the way, there are plenty of wonderfully creepy moments -- the three ghosts in a rotting bedroom/mirror, the offering of buttons and thick black thread, weird circus acts, and much more. The horror is subtle, the delicious creepiness is not.<br /><br />Coraline -- the Alice in this Notsowonderland -- is a wonderful little heroine: strong, sensible, self-sufficient but still fairly freaked out about what is happening around her. Normally I'm not crazy about Dakota Fanning, but voice-only she's quite good in this role.<br /><br />The sarcastic cat is a wonderful counterpoint, and the movie's original character Wybie makes a nice companion (albeit an extraneous one). And the other mother is the stuff of nightmares -- she's utterly inhuman and merciless, and by the movie's climax she's become the stuff of nightmares. Oh, and French and Saunders make a pair of fun cameos as the kooky neighbors.<br /><br />\\"Coraline\\" is a brilliantly dark little movie, full of dark magic and eerie creatures -- definitely for fans of Gaiman, dark fantasy and really creepy stuff.The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"James and the Giant Peach.\\" Instead, Selick gives it a dark, cobwebby atmosphere, brilliant colours and surreal details (the button eclipsing the moon).

0321687299|3.0|I found this book to be a good update on the new stuff in HTML5, including good information on some accessibility issues. However, some things are already out of date, since HTML5 & HTML5 browser support has changed since this book was written, and a 2nd edition is soon to be available.<br /><br />It's important to note that this book is not for the beginner. The reader should already be somewhat familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also, this is not a reference book, so don't count on that. If it were a reference book, it would be A LOT bigger and probably less beneficial.<br /><br />Some have mentioned the humor in this book. Let's just say it is \\"childish\\" and \\"sophomoric\\"; the authors must have an underlying desire to be \\"megahunks\\". But many may find this type of humor funny (depending on the type of humor they like), and some could find it offensive and/or annoying and/or unprofessional.<br /><br />But I wouldn't buy this edition with the 2nd edition coming soon. HTML5 and user agent support for HTML5 have changed and HTML5 is still not final (though it's true that a lot is still the same and would still be useful). I would recommend waiting for the upcoming 2nd edition, unless you have to have this now for some reason.<br /><br />Because this book is already out of date (it was written Nov 2009 to May 2010) & the 2nd edition is upon us, I only feel comfortable giving the 1st edition 3 stars, but if the 2nd edition is just as good as the 1st edition was when it was first released, then I would probably have to give the 2nd edition 4 or 5 stars (leaning toward 5)... so I recommend the 2nd edition instead (I have the 2nd edition on order).
B00432QAKK|5.0|I am so happy that Married With Children series finally came out on dvd, been waiting so long. I watched almost every episode growing up and will continue to watch the heck out of these dvds. I don't care that they don't have any extras I just love the episodes. Thanks
B001WCN23W|1.0|I'll make this quick.    Look, I own 1000s of CDs in my collection, and the 2009 Rolling Stones remasters are among the worst-sounding CDs I have ever heard. Obviously, the music is great on all of them, but the sound just sucks. Remastered? Try OVER-remastered, if that's possible. It is compressed, distorted, and edgy, none of the above things you want in a Stones album. If you have the 1990 Columbia pressing or the 1994 Virgin Records pressing, stick with that.     'Sticky Fingers' is worse than any of the other 2009 remasters. This actually may take the cake for the worst remaster/reissue I have ever heard. The organ on 'I Got the Blues' is just deafening. 'Can't You Hear Me Knocking' features a great saxophone/guitar interplay, but that now also sounds just grating. Everything has been mixed waaaay too high with these reissues. Shame on you, Polydor, for releasing these pieces of crap.    As I said above, don't sell your 1990 and/or 1994 CD pressing of this. This is one of the best albums ever made, and everyone should hear it in one format or another, but you wouldn't know it by this 2009 remaster. Dreadful, just dreadful. I sold my copy of it to my local record shop and made some good money for it. If you have this, I advise you do the same and use the money you make from selling this to buy a '90 or '94 pressing of this (if you don't have one already).    NOT RECOMMENDED.
1442344989|5.0|I listened to this book on audio book. I think I would have had a hard time reading it, but listening to Jaycee reading it was easy. It made everything so real, which it obviously was. I have read some reviews on this book that say that they did not like the book because it didn't show how Jaycee has grown. Come on people, it hasn't been that long since she got out of the horrible situation she was in!!! This book is an account of her life after she was taken from her family. She already didn't have the most encouraging home life with a step father who wasn't really there for her. Then, she's taken from what she knows and forced to do things no person, let alone 11 year old, should ever have to do.<br />No, this wasn't the best written book in the world. She is not an author. She is a person who put down into words what her life was like, someone who only got an education until she was 11 years old. I was actually pretty impressed that she was able to write her story as well as she did given her upbringing.<br />If you want an account of what her life was like while with the man who took her, read this book. If you want to hear how she is dealing with trying to now get back to reality, read this book. If you want to hear about how she is now a happy, recovered woman, wait ten years for her to write another book.
0345529057|5.0|I loved this series of books. Im so glad that I bought all 4 at once so I didnt have to wait to see what happens next.Once again the reviews on Amazon helped me to decide to give this series a try. Thanks!   I cant help but wonder how the tv series is going to include all the funny thoughts of the dwarf. I sat on my couch laughing out loud. This guy never catches a break though. He is so not apreciated by his family.  What a rich bunch of characters! Jon and Arya have my vote for the best of the Starks, with Bran coming in a close second.   Buy the whole set you will be mad at yourself if you dont.
B004B63M1S|5.0|Great movie! I really enjoyed watching it.  Why does Amazon make you type so much and make such strict rules on what words they will count for the \\"20 words\\"?  I just wanted to give this 5 stars, and they make it so difficult.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|The plot is average, but the main let down is; with all these babes it should have been much sexier.  The outfits should have been hotter and camera shots could have shown much more.  I regret purchasing it but would still say it is worth a rent.
031261246X|5.0|In short: this is a recommended read for everyone who likes a thriller!    To test that short description, I'm feeding the book to my non-techie wife who loves reading thrillers. I'm suspicious she'll have a hard time during the first few chapters because the technology described may be \\"too much\\" for anyone out there. On the other hand, it gave the book a very realistic touch and if you see through it, the book evolves from a list of random events, a computer security specialist trying to investigate such an event into a very well-written thriller which shuffles back and forth between localities and characters, all coming together in an entertaining, nerve wrecking (as it should be :-)) suspense near the plot.    The fact that all of this could happen today gives the story a creepy feeling: next to entertaining the reader it also provides some food for thought.    I can't wait to see more of this type of books from Mark!
B0050PYNO4|1.0|Throwing in every negative stereotype the Brits have towards the USA and trying to make it seem funny. What I thought would be a send up, campy take, on nearly 40 years of scifi/adventure movies turned out to be a self righteous, condescending lecture on American violence and religious views. Didn't even get the Christian part right, not even close. Wasn't even a good \\"stick to the man\\" movie. Just a lame excuse to vent and ridicule an entire culture.  I made the mistake of seeing the piece of crap at the theater.  If you hate Christians and enjoy indulging in every possible negative stereotype of Americans, then this movie is for you. But even if you are inclined to that sort of thing...don't expect any laughs. Hold out for the bottom of the bargain bin at your local big box store. Better yet, wait for the streaming version at your favorite online site. The less money you spend, the less ripped off you will feel.    There are plenty of movies that can explore and expose our shortcomings in a thoughtful, insightful way. \\"Paul\\" isn't one of them.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|There is a scene in this movie in which Diane Lane looks into the eyes of her horse, Secretariat, and the camera lingers on the large brown eyes of this beautiful animal. There is a very long moment of eye contact between the two and in the final analysis she makes an important decision about the future of Secretariat. Any dog lover will recognize the intense unspoken communication between her and her horse.<br /><br />This isn't your father's Disney movie. there is a back story of a working mom and entrepreneur, a horse lover, and a failing ranch. Secretariat is as much a star of this movie as is Diane Lane. This is the world of Mad Men, set in the rarified world of professional racing and breeding. The story is engaging on many levels, and I am not an easy sell.<br /><br />A terrific movie for families...highly recommended!

1451629184|5.0|This Book was amazing! I read this book in two days! I am not the type of guy who reads a book in a couple days but I could just not put this book down! Jaycee went through so much and after that to say that she does not hate Phillip (her abuser)! That is one forgiving person with a big heart.This book will show you that there are sick people in this world but there is always a way to get away from it.

1933952806|5.0|First camera guide I've ever felt worthy of purchase. I'm using it like a workbook. Going thru page by page with camera in hand. The D7000 is truly a powerful camera and I don't want to overlook any features. Though I have used the D70s, D80 and D90 successfully for years the D7K demands the best from it's users. Until I found this book I would've winged it with the manual. The best thing about this 496 page guide is the recommendations after each section. For once a camera guide worth buying. The D7K is a little bit different from the other Nikons. If you have one, invest in yourself and learn it inside out. Best ten or twenty dollar bill you'll spend in a long time. I have the hard copy format.
0062060554|5.0|Christine awakens to remember very little from of her recent past each morning, in fact she only remembers the time before an shadowly incident that seems to have occured many years ago.  When she looks at her reflection in the mirror upon waking, a stranger seems to stare back at her. Each day she virtually awakens with very little or no memory of what had occured in the preceeding day or days, nor can she remember Ben her husband the stranger she awakens with each day.   She discovers, with the help of a doctor, that she has amnesia and that in order for her to try to remember things that happen each day and also those snipets of memories that come to her of her faint to nonexsistent past, she writes them down in a journal.         From the start there are more and more questions then answers that Christine encounters in each day. Is her husband Ben, continually lying to her about her past? Why is he seemingly reluctant to discuss more than just a little at a time? Why are her visits with the doctor kept a secret from him? When exactly did her memory capabilities get so messed up and why?    S.J. Watson debut novel is a facinating somewhat terrifying ride. The psychological terror of reading about someone who has seemingly lost herself, Christine's feelings of not knowing who to trust are overwhelming and terrorizing. The many emotion's that Christine feels of confusion, terror, sadness and feeling's of hopelessness jump off the page and make you feel truely uneasy as a result. The story was very unpredictable, although I tried throughout the book to guess, the story always shocked me. Watson did a great job his debut novel. I found it original, well paced and at times downright unnerving, Before I go to sleep will keep you in it's grip from first, to last page.
0553801473|4.0|Yes, not a lot happened, other than the plot grew denser... this story seems to be evolving in baby steps at this point.  But guess what?  I loved & thoroughly enjoyed it anyway.  Like a lot of folks, I didn't wait half a dozen years for this book... maybe that tempered my expectations, I don't know.  I started reading \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" last summer after learning HBO was making it into a series.  Was never a big fan of the fantasy genre, but got sucked into this series from the first few chapters of AGOT.<br /><br />Hope the pay off's a doozy, Mr. Martin.  With all this foreplay, it better be.  :-)
B0058P7KUA|5.0|The campaign is indeed short as others have said, but I&apos;ve been kept plenty occupied with survival mode. The graphics are nice, but I found the controls to be the best part.

I got this back when it was the Amazon free app of the day, but I would have gladly paid had I known how much time I&apos;d put into it.
B0018BB20W|5.0|This was truly the first album by The Moody Blues at least the verison we've come to know. Justin Hayward replaced Denny Laine as frontman and John Lodge came on board as bassist adding two singing/composing talents to the band. Their new album was done on the sly--Decca wanted them to record a rock/orchestration version of \\"Picutres at an Exhibition\\" to test the new Decca stereo system. The Moodies agree provided they had no interference from the suits. They met with their producer Tony Clarke and stated that they wanted to do an album of original songs--a song cycle about the passing of the day with orchestrations by Peter Knight.<br /><br />\\"Days of Future Passed\\" (named by the label NOT by the band themselves) resulted form this unusual collaboration featuring songs the band had been trying on the road using their new acquisition-a mellotron that Mike Pinder had obtained.<br /><br />This remaster done in 2008 with Justin Hayward has a number of merits and flaws; As with all the previous versions since the original issue of the album this features the remix tha Tony Clarke and the band prepared in the early 1970's replacing the original mix which they felt wasn't quite as good as it could have been. The master is compressed and loud compared to all previous editions but not uncomfortably so (at least for me)--be aware however that means that there isn't much dynamic range here and that peak limiting has been applied.<br /><br />The best sounding versions of this album are still 1) the Mobile Fidelity CD 2) the Decca first pressing on CD (the vinyl, of course is another matter entirely)with this third. The bonus tracks are the reason to pick this up (unless you want the multi-track SACD which does sound quite nice).<br /><br />We get (for this edition) a BBC radio session of the band performing \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\". We also get the singles \\"Fly Me High\\"/I Really Haven't Got The Time\\" (the latter has been avaiable on CD before), \\"Love and Beauty\\"/\\"Leave This Man Alone\\" and the b-side \\"Cities\\" all presented in mono (none of these were ever remixed for stereo to the best of my knowledge).<br /><br />We also get four alternate mixes/outtakes:<br />\\"Tuesday Afternoon\\"-an alternate mix<br />\\"Dawn is a Feeling\\"-an alternate version<br />\\"The Sun set\\"-an alternate version without orchestra<br />and \\"Twilight Time\\" with an alternate vocal mix.<br /><br />There's an excellent, comprehensive 20 page book that covers the recording sessions.<br /><br />While this isn't the optimal presentation of the album in terms of the mastering, the bonus tracks make this reissue an essential addition for Moody fans AND, if you can find the two disc SACD set, snatch that up as it has a multi-track mix for 5.1<br /><br />Recommended but be aware of the limitations of this reissue.\\"Cities\\" all presented in mono (none of these were ever remixed for stereo to the best of my knowledge).

B000QCS8TW|1.0|I actually wished I could give it zero stars. If you pick up this book thinking you could connect with a character forget it! This book give fantasy a bad name. I'm all for multiple POV but this is ridiculous. A barrage of characters that you will plain out loath or are evil. There is nothing to look forward to in the book. No clash of good and evil or even a gray area villain to cheer on. Just a endless parade of bad people doing bad things! All in all if you want a book that you cant follow and mass characters die for no reason with no plot movment....here it is.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This CD is as much of a hit with me (a 52 y/o mom) as it is with my 21 and 17 y/o sons!  I ordered it for myself, knowing that the 2 tracks being played on the radio were ones I and my family enjoyed.  As soon as it arrived, my two boys grappled over who got to download it to their MP3 player first!  Then I put it in my car CD player, as enjoyable listening for around town and road trips, only to have it \\"pilfered\\" to my son's car CD player!!  Love the mellow harmonies, the wistful lyrics & haunting melodies of Mumford & sons as well as the rousing, uplifting choruses.  This CD includes tracks that are tender, lively, spiritual, moving and upbeat, that appeal to everyone in my family.  But be warned that one track contains explicit language (bleeped out on radio airplay) so would not be suitable if you have younger kids.

B00003CXDD|5.0|This movie is a classic for any child ages 8 and up.  It has all the magic and fantasy that newer movies have, but more clean cut.
B003KGBIRK|5.0|I originally saw this at the theater - after it was over, we just sat there and thought \\"What the !#!#?\\" Did not know if we liked it or hated it. The movie was that bizarre.  Debbie Harry and the cigarette burning scene - truly memorable (She was the hottest punk rocker at the time.) The unrated director's cut is the way to go - you want to see this thing in it's entirety. A sanitized version? No way. If you think the ending of Fight Club was a total mind warping idea, Videodrome will blow you away.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|this movie kept you guessing as to whether the lawyer was good or bad. Loved Trace Adkins as a motorcycle gang member. He makes it believable. Can't wait to watch it again.
B000021Y77|5.0|I've probably watched \\"Run Lola Run\\" a dozen times.  The photography, directing, acting and plot are attention-grabbing.  The music (I have the soundtrack CD) is perfect, and the film is fast paced. It's a great watch on the treadmill and the score is a good jogging or skiing iPod addition.  Franka Potente went on to the Borne movies (as well as many others), and while many people find her annoying, she's a good fit for Lola. Lola has three \\"runs\\" - basically three do-overs for the same events, and we see how each progresses and what she learns from them.  It's a German movie, so there are a lot of cultural nods and references that foreigners would miss. The voice-over is by Hans Paetsch, a famous children's narrator. Famous German actors of yesteryear have cameos, and there are quotes and references attributed to other famous Germans (these were pointed out to me by a friend.)  Because this is a foreign film, the photography style, editing, actors, etc. are different from what we're used to, and the ending is typically European.  This only adds to the movie's attraction.  If you like fast paced or off the wall movies, you'll thoroughly enjoy Lola.
B003Y5H542|5.0|I thought this movie was very funny. Johnny Depp is great as Rango. Great idea to do a western with animals.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|I'm leaning toward saying Going for the One. Grandeur, beauty, melody, virtuosity, all the great things hoped for from Yes. Moments reminiscent of dare i say it? Tales. I said it. Wildly beyond my expectations given the absence of the great Jon Anderson. Its unfortunate I've had to let some classic Yes fans know about the cd, but in each case they've been very glad I did. If you don't have it, get it!
B003UESJFG|5.0|I've always loved cartoons and most animated movies. This was fun to watch and actually gets better when viewed more than once. Will Ferrell gives his voice to the \\"Megamind\\" villian (but he's not as evil as he thought he was). I'll enjoy watching this again with my grandkids :)  The DVD arrived in great shape and in under a weeks time.

B004FOOQV6|5.0|I was looking for a conversion app for the new Toshiba Thrive, frankly just got tired of having to look things up on the Internet all the time. After looking at several I decided to download this one and I'm really glad I did! This bad boy will convert anything you could ever need. Easy to use, plenty of options. You just swipe the category at the top until the one you want shows at the bottom of the area. then you can see up to 4 conversions at the same time. It works as promised, no muss no fuss! I'd rank it as a must have at the price. From kitchens to construction sites to labs, it has a use; even converts shoe sizes!

This means that Japanese language is not actually supported in language selection on disk-menu (only Italian and Portuguese is selectable as the disk function. Even English is not selectable).<br />This means that the product description in Amazon.com page is wrong (not same as disc package description) and very confusing. It shouled be corrected urgently.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This is a nice upgrade to the original SwiftKey.  The prediction really does get better as you use the keyboard more.  I do wish that it had better voice recognition and some type of swiping feature.  The lack of swiping keeps me from using this as my full time keyboard.  I keep going back to either Swype of FlexT9.  Still, the keyboard is great and does what it is advertised to do and that's why I gave it 4 stars.

B0058OUJA4|1.0|Sorry, I can&apos;t think of a single good reason why a game needs to discover known accounts on my phone, especially not a paid game. Until I get that reason, no install here...there are plenty of other games to play that don&apos;t do this. &quot;
B0043GAZYS|1.0|First of all, I should be clear that the review I am giving is not about the film, which is excellent (and I would give it 4*), but about the article received, which is really not.    I went to significant additional expense to purchase the US version of the film (I live in the UK), because the US version was expressed to include a digital copy of the film.    When I received the item I went to download the digital copy to find that Universal no longer supply it.  I emailed to complain that I should be entitled to receive the digital copy given that I had paid for the copy of the film which included it, only to be stonewalled by Universal, who didn't even bother with an explanation, but just said that the copy is no longer available.     This is appalling customer service, and I urge anyone looking to buy a Universal DVD or Blu-Ray with a digital copy to make sure on the Universal website ahead of time whether the film you think you have purchased is actually still available, as Universal seem to have decided that our rights as consumers don't mean a fat lot and they can simply deny you access to films you have purchased whenever they feel like it.
0316098329|5.0|Another well written and frighteningly real story.  The author, Emma Donoghue, gives five-year old Jack a voice.  He courageously enters into a pact with his mother who had been the victim of a psychopathic sex offender.<br />The words are riveting as the reader learns of the ordeal through the eyes of the child.  It is visually and audibly written as well with fine descriptive scenes and sounds to give the reader a full imagery of the scenes.<br />I would highly recommend this cleverly written book as I found it hard to put down.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|KILLING FLOOR reminded me a little bit of Oz.  It's a pretty spectacular novel, full of crazy twists and turns.  It builds from a small story about a bum passing through a small town in Georgia to a massive, international, big-big-dealio counterfeiting operation in a natural, organic way.  It's a BIG book and the dead bodies pile up as Reacher plows his way towards the thrilling conclusion, but Child doesn't lose sight of the building blocks - I cared about the whole cast of characters by the end, a half-dozen people who had all bravely done their parts to foil the bad guys.  But, and here's the Oz part, every so often I could see the Wizard lurking around pulling the strings and that spoiled some of the fun.<br /><br />And by that I mean it got easy to spot where Child was laying out his clues.  A nice early example comes when Jack Reacher is tossed in state prison for a few days with this guy, Paul Hubble.  There's a big scene where a prison bully stomps into the cell and tries to push Hubble around.  One of the first things he does is smash Hubble's glasses.  It seems like a random act of violence, just setting up Reacher's moment to step in and save the day, but turns out to be not random at all.  After a few more incidents it got really easy to see that something that was (1) showy and memorable and (2) random-seeming was always a Big Clue and never a random incident.  It made it easy to follow the very complicated plot but also made it super easy to see the author nudging events into a nice choreography.<br /><br />There were a few other little things.  Like, at one point Reacher takes a trip to New York City just so he can have a conversation with a guy.  I don't know why conversations are more interesting in novels when they are face-to-face vs. over the phone, but it's generally true.  Still, having a character waste a whole day when time is tight just to add a little drama to a plain old conversation?  Lame.<br /><br />Thing is, I could make a long list of little niggling things that bugged me but a whole world of nitpicking doesn't change the fact that KILLING FLOOR is a very impressive novel.  I've been curious about the Jack Reacher series for a while now, and despite all the hype I wasn't disappointed.  Reacher is this deceptively plain-spoken anti-hero who grabs hold of your attention and just yanks you along though the novel, holding center stage no matter how crazy things get.  I won't say that I'm hooked but, sure, I'm more than happy to follow him through another novel or two.  Dude's got charisma.s that bugged me but a whole world of nitpicking doesn't change the fact that KILLING FLOOR is a very impressive novel.

B00003CY5J|3.0|This is a movie I saw a long time ago on television. I had not forgotten how enjoyable the movie was, but seeing it on television I was not certain (other than the main actor being DeNiro, and some of Marlon Brando) of the degree of profanity. Hollywood, New York, and everyone else doing movies (except for the great and trustful Movies of Faith companies) have a huge responsibility regarding the way they have taken our country. Movie companies have the biggest failing in the fall of our nation, beginning with language, going to under-age and un-wed sex.<br />If My people who are called by My Name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land. 2Chronicles 7:14. God help us all.<br />With O'Bama having stolen the Presidency hope is on the wane, but all that is left due to his running away from the One True God Almighty.
B002N8A14M|4.0|I like this item. The only bad thing was that the hole for the area where the iPod is controlled, didn't exactly line up. I'm not sure if that is a design flaw, or if I'm incorrect about what generation my iPod is. Either way, it still works and I like it a lot.
B0055D3EOG|2.0|When I gear up to watch a horror movie, I expect a whole hell of a lot. My standards for horror are VERY high. This movie misses the mark by about 700 miles. There are a few creepy moments scattered throughout, and places where you see the potential for a truly terrifying movie, but it pulls back from every good idea it has. The concept is great, the movie is NOT. It gets super cheesy toward the end, like, unforgivably cheesy. Look, some men's trash is others treasure. I was wildly unimpressed with this movie. I hoped for a lot more.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Loving the graphics, sounds and the way towers change as you upgrade them. The levels are also each very unique.
0307595862|3.0|I battled my way through the first half of this book trying to keep track of the many characters and plot lines. Luckily I had a piece of cake late at night & the sugar high kept me going until the pace of the novel picked up enough to push me across the finish line. Implausible? Yeah. Clunky? yeah. Cliched? Yeah. But not horrible & I will give Mr. Nesbo the benefit of the doubt about the writing (I have not read anything else by him and probably won;t)and hope that it is so odd at certain points due to a bad translation. Too complicated and \\"clever\\" for its own good. And I didn;t believe the final (almost final?!?!) BIG scene at all.<br />And what's up with the mold guy???
B000B8657S|3.0|Pro:<br />You'll hear all of Schubert's songs.<br />Cons:<br />1. You'll realize that two-thirds of them should have been fed to the flames. But this was not Schubert's way of working. He saved everything.<br />• Consequently you get all of his juvenilia, his Italianesque recitatives, and his embryonic half-efforts that later became his great songs.<br /><br />2.  Many--possibly most of these--were not recorded in a real studio and properly mixed.<br />• If you don't believe me, just compare them to any good (echo-proof) studio recording of a &#34;star.&#34;<br />•  Many of these were apparently recorded in a barren hall with hard, sound-reflective floors and walls.<br />• The result is often poorly blended. Too many high overtones. Good luck trying to hear all the notes in the piano. You must increase the volume. Of course, at higher volumes, any forte from the singer will be ear splitting.<br /><br />3. There's a great variance in competence among the singers.<br />4. MANY are sung in FALSETTO. This did NOT occur in German lieder of this period.<br /><br />You can save a lot of money and time (it probably takes 48 hours to hear all these) by purchasing those songs of Schubert that have stood the test of time and were recorded in professional studios.der of this period. An unforgivable anachronism.<br /><br />You can save money and time (it probably takes around 48 hours to hear all of these) simply by purchasing collections of Schubert's songs that have stood the test of time, recorded by big names in good studios.<br /><br />This collection has reference value but not much else, in my opinion. Yet again, the bigger names on these CDs--where they occur--sound wonderful.<br /><br />Then again, if you love lots of tinny reverb bouncing off of hard walls and a voice that's double the volume of the piano--you might just love these.
B001EO748M|5.0|I have only watched the first two seasons and I must say that season 2 is going to be hard to improve on. This season was excellent and you are really starting to see the tyrant in which I and many others find King Henry the 8th to be. I have started to hate King Henry more and more and that is by the great acting of Meyers. You know an actor is really good when they make you feel the way you should about that type of character. But all in all this season was really very good, and I am truly going to miss Anne Boleyn's part on the show, she was portrayed wonderfully.
B0057VU1VU|5.0|This is the first album to come along in a while where I like every song. Well, there are three that I'm not really crazy about but that's me, they'll still great songs. Three I am crazy about are: \\"Hard to Believe\\", \\"Take Me As I Am\\", and \\"Let Me Fall For You\\". I love how Matt Serletic brings the different layers of Davids' voice out. \\"Circadian\\", \\"Goodbye to the Girl\\" and \\"Rapid Eye Movement\\" are EPIC!! I have said before that 30-yrs from now people will be looking at this album \\"This Loud Morning\\" as a classic rock album, which it is. David is starting his Tour in October, if you haven't seen him live, Please try and catch his concerts. Unlike most artist who sound great in the studio but NOT live, David is great in the studio and 10-times better LIVE!!!!

B0053Q9DQI|1.0|i can't even give this movie any stars but they make you give one. which is why it's a one. This movie was so bad that i had hard time getting through it. The acting was really bad. I didn't feel any connection between Rochester and Jane. Just wasn't there. I have seen better versions of this movie. Also this movie jumped around to much. When you go to the special features and see the deleted scenes that they should have keeped in the movie would have been better with them.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|I found the topic of this novel very interesting but unfortunately, the book itself was a bore. I expected some degree of repetitiveness throughout the novel given the topic, but this book really could have been a fraction of its length and readers would still get the same out of it. I had a hard time finishing this book and it became almost a chore to do so. The book gained a page turning quality only at the very end. This was the only place in the book where I found myself looking forward to finding out what was on the next page rather than having a likely prediction of what was going to be repeated on subsequent pages. Although this book was definitely not for me, I must say I don't know how the author could've written a novel about this topic in a more interesting way.
0553801473|2.0|I found it difficult to finish this book because I didn't care about most of the characters. I enjoyed the Arya and Jon segments, but the others rarely held my interest.  I have fond memories of reading the earlier books, but that thrill was largely absent here.

B000FC1HBY|4.0|Most of my review for the first book applies to this one as well, with a few minor differences:<br /><br />I am not sure if it was the book or just what I was going through in real life at the time that I read it, but I found this one a little harder to get into than the first one. But not that much harder. It was still a very good read, although the plot felt slow at first and finally picked up towards the end of the book. Because of this, I did consider not getting the third book, but my curiosity about \\"what happens next\\" got to me and I ended up getting it anyway. I definitely don't regret spending money or time on this book, though, it was worth the read!
B003Y74AXO|5.0|After spending a lot more on other brands only to mess them up due to incomplete instructions, I decided to give this one a try. Of course I'd rather pay as little as possible for these, but at least this one came with readable instructions. This is the first protector that actually is on correctly. It also came when promised and it was well packed. Other than less money I don't know what else one could ask for.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book was one of the best I've read in a long time. I have never really been into the fantasy genre, but this changed that for me. Where I found \\"Lord of the Rings\\" hard to read and get into, I found this book to be the complete opposite of that.<br /><br />The way this book is done was different than I was used to. For starters, there are no chapter numbers. This drove me crazy at first, especially since I like to talk about the book with my friend. We always have to say \\"That part where so-and-so did such-and-such\\". It would have been nice to be able to say \\"Chapter 14, towards the end\\" instead. But really, that's my only real complaint about this book.<br /><br />Another thing that was different is that the story is told from the perspective of several different characters in the book, and each chapter is a different character, and later on that character is revisited by more chapters. This took some getting used to on my part, as did the vast number of characters. I actually had to print up a chart to help me organize who was who and who was related to who, but my short term memory isn't very good.<br /><br />The author's writing skill is good, in my opinion. This is something that matters to me after reading some other books where the story was good but the writing skill was bad. I don't let bad writing skill keep me from a good story, but it can be distracting. Thankfully, the author of this book writes well enough that I was able to slip right into the world that is created in the book.<br /><br />And oh, what a world it is. The book is just descriptive enough that you can immerse yourself and reality slips away around you. The characters are developed nicely and the plots (both the main one and the sub plots) are interesting and at times, surprising. Definitely not \\"light reading\\" by any means, yet vastly enjoyable.<br /><br />This book was really a feast for the brain, and it has totally change my opinion about the fantasy genre and has inspired me to give Lord of the Rings another try someday soon. But for now, I am eager to jump into the next book in this series, because it definitely leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />A note about the Kindle version: The Kindle version was very well formatted, I found no issues whatsoever.omeday soon.

B001GS2JJ0|5.0|Guitarist Charlie Byrd was invited to travel and play in Brazil during a cultural goodwill tour sponsored by the Kennedy administration in 1961. He was completely enamoured by the music, and when he returned, he headed straight for the recording studio to make the now classic Jazz Samba. Collaborating with Stan Getz on tenor sax and backed by a band that included Gene Byrd (bass, guitar), Keter Betts (bass), and Buddy Deppenschmidt and Bill Reichenbach (drums), Byrd forged a new and brilliant sound. American record companies were to churn out hundreds of watered bossa-pop albums that have since given the style its lounge-addled image, but this album stands as a tribute to the vitality and adaptability of jazz. --Louis Gibson      1.

0767827791|1.0|I purchased this, noting the word \\"restored\\" prominently displayed on the package.  However, it is not is widescreen, so you are not even seeing what the film maker originally intended.  The print wasn't that great either.  Why do they sell products like this?  I guess it's because people like me buy them, and don't pay enough attention to the description.  Looked into returning it, but amazon would only refund half of the price.  With me paying the postage, I would have lost money on the deal.  Anyone want it?
0307276902|5.0|Best book I have read. I could care less if its true or not. Its James's writing style I so enjoy.  Oprah lost all her credibility when she first chose the book then condemned the writer. She the queen with the staff of minions to do all her work and research. I put the blame square in Oprah's lap whom wrongly took it out on the writer. Had her staff done there job she could have avoided the whole ordeal. But lucky for me I dont blindly follow said Queen. Like I said true or not I loved it.<br /> side note \\"OWN\\" is not doing so well and come to think of it neither is our current President. Yet another endorsement from the queen herself without any research.<br />Keep writing James Ill keep buying.

We are always wondering what our dog's different expressions mean and now we have a glimpse through this main character.

030788743X|5.0|Easily one of my top reads of the year. I am placing this right up there with Game of Thrones for my fiction reading of 2011(more science fiction). I was put into memory bliss reliving and reading names of games and 80's pop culture that I grew up with. I kept a tab on all cultural references and now have a long list of items to read, watch, and play.<br /><br />Aside from my nostalgia moments, the story was so intriguing. I was fascinated by the online world. It seems so plausible as each generation growing up is more tuned in online than the real world. I was so curious about how the author would intertwine all the elements presented. I was blown away  more than once at how he integrated so much and made it seem so easy to follow. I felt like I was actually part of a game myself.<br /><br />There is a lot of action, a lot of tense moments, very likable characters, and of course everything for a geek to love and adore. If you are a fan of movies, video games, pop culture, the future of technology, etc. then you MUST read this book. You will not be disappointed. Too bad this book is going to put a damper on my reading time as I go back to relive my moments of glory on my 8 bit NES.

Why this is so difficult for people to follow, I have no clue.<br /><br />If the people reading was your average person who typically reads fluff fiction, romance novels, etc., I could see this as a problem. But I'm assuming (terribly, it seems) the people reading the book are hard-core fantasy and sci-fi fans. Anyone who has read \\"Snowcrash,\\" \\"Dune,\\" \\"The Illuminati,\\" or even \\"LOTR\\" should be used to more complicated storylines. Heaven forfend, Martin is making you think and ponder the storyline. This is not a trashy summer novel to read on the beach. You are dealing with many detailed layers involving politics, warfare, reputation, influence, power, wealth, etc. In short, you are reading a series that you could, with some thought, apply it to major politics events in current events.<br /><br />If you want to read a book that will actually engage you, and force you to confront a much more realistic look on politics, warefare, power, etc. in a fantasy setting (no magic wands, no great wizard to wave his hand and make the enemies disappear, no great warriors who are flawless), then this is the book for you.<br /><br />If it's fantasy fluff you want to read, there are plenty of novels out there. But you will not find that in this book, or in this series.

It really works hard to keep the same light-hearted tone of the original while updating the story quite nicely.  I mean, things have changed a lot in the last 25 years and if you want to make a story like this work, it's either a period piece or modern day, that's it.  The cast is great. Farrell is so freaking sexy mean that he reminds you of what a vampire is supposed to be. This has some fun FX, good laughs, a few decent scares and great cinematography and music.  The source material is obviously well-regarded by the filmmakers.  Sad, though, there were only about 20 people in the theater when I saw this.  Most were easily over 35.  The new vampire fans don't seem to be interested and it's a shame.

1932100660|5.0|Read The China Study before agreeing with anyone's opinions here, mine included.  Several of the claims by a featured negative reviewer are inaccurate, chief among them his unfounded and broad assessment that at the time of the study the Chinese diet was homogenous. Campbell specifically describes the variability in diet across the locations sampled. Unlike the reviewer, Campbell gives proof of variability. He describes how blood sampling was used to assess the amounts of animal fats, animal proteins, blood cholesterol, and other blood contents in the location-specific populations.     My reading of The China Study and of other works by medical researchers with strong dedication to fact has led me -- a gourmet -- to eschew much of the tasty but unhealthy fare in my diet. On my plate is plenty of what my mother used to call \\"bunny food\\" before she died early of cancer. My cholesterol is dropping and my general fitness and alertness are improving because of diet. (My ears are not lengthening, nor am I getting furry.)    I am always wary when a supposed \\"Truth in Science\\" person calls a scientist of Campbell's stature a \\"zealot\\". Leave that language for describing philosophical differences.  Far more worrisome is what one discovers by following the money in medical research. Whose money is critical to staffing and funding medical schools and research institutions? Whose names are on the very buildings in which our medical experts work? Who are the \\"experts\\" called to serve on the policy-making government commissions and nonprofit councils? As with the cozy relationship between practitioners and the pharmaceutical industry until Marcia Angell pulled the curtain from around the vacations, free samples, and weekly pizzas, there are corrupting revolving doors in Congress and in medical research that make it profitable to align one's unproven or poorly founded opinions with the food industry. Too bad everyone who profits from the American dairy industry doesn't wear a whitemustache.    In the end, this is science. It is not, as FOX news likes to claim, fair and balanced. Either thousands of people have improved their health and reversed diet-influenced disease or they haven't. When cardiologists send their loved ones to other cardiologists knowing they will prescribe a plant-based diet, the truth is leaking out to the general public. You choose: Greens or scalpel?     I believe in science and consider Campbell's work highly laudable for its contributions to the health and happiness of individuals and to controlling health care costs for our nation.
B004GHYCKW|1.0|As a long time fan of PJ Harvey, it pains me to say, Let England Shake is not bad.. it's terrible. Not worth 1 star! For critics to say that she has taken steps forward with this new release is a farse and to call it a masterpiece is a suckerpunch to the crotch! Remember folks, music critics get paid by music labels. You are being told what to like. What's even worse, is when you get duped with a load of dung like this, you can't return the CD! Music companies + no return policy = winning!<br />Straight to point, LES sounds likes an amateur debut album of a garage band that has had only 3 practices and released to the masses as a joke to mock consumerism. Was this her intention? Or has the rock goddess I have adored for 20+ yrs dried out? This seems to be a trend.. it was heartbreaking to see Tori Amos take this path as well. I am devastated. RIP PJ Harvey, you will be missed.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I, along with many other people were pretty excited when I kept seeing the previews for this movie.  I wasn't sure what to expect and didn't think I'd like it once I found out it was an original story just carrying the title of Planet of The Apes.  I figures some cash cow was trying to make a 2nd rate movie milking off the name Planet of The Apes.  But I decided to give it a chance and I'm glad I did, I've completely changed my tone towards this movie and can't wait for the sequel.<br /><br />Plot:<br />***SPOILER ALERT****<br />The plot is slightly based, although not directly copied from \\"The Conquest of the Apes\\" from 1972.  It centers around scientist Will Rodman (played by James Franco) who has discovered a virus that when given to chimpanzees it begins repairing their brain and making them more intelligent, in particular a female ape that can solve a child's puzzle very quickly.  Rodman plans to use this virus to cure Alzheimer's disease, which his father has.  But at the investor's meeting, the female ape goes crazy and goes on a rampage because she fears they are trying to harm her newborn baby.  The project is then shut down and all the chimps are ordered to be put down.  One of the scientists doesn't have the heart to put down the baby and gives him to Will Rodman, who decides to take him home for a few days.<br /><br />Will Rodman decides to keep the baby chimp because he notices the intelligence has been passed from mother to child, and decides to name him Caesar.  Rodman steals some of the virus and gives it to his father to help him.  Which it does, and he not only regains perfect brain function he becomes much smarter than before.  Life is good for Rodman, until he finds the effects of the virus diminish and his father returns to his dementia once again.  He gets into a car that isn't his and starts crashing into cars left and right, the angry neighbor comes out and starts to yell at the father and poke at him.  Caesar seeing all this becomes furious and figures a way to get out of the house and attacks the neighbor.  For this he can no longer stay with Rodman and must live in an animal sanctuary.<br /><br />Caesar feels that he was abandoned in this prison where he is mistreated by the one of the staff(Tom Felton).  Meanwhile Rodman tries to find a way to get Caesar back as well as trying to create a new virus that will help his Dad.  He finds a way and they begin testing on apes again.  They find out that it works even better than the last one but one of the scientists accidentally inhales some of the virus.  Thinking its nothing, they continue on as usual, but it turns out that the virus is fatal to humans, and a pandemic is beginning to start.  Meanwhile, Caesar figures out a way to escape his prison and return to his home where he finds some of the new virus in the refrigerator, he brings it back to the other apes and expose them all to the virus.  Making them just as smart as he is.  They then escape and the staff worker tries to stop Caesar and shock him with his taser, Caesar grabs his hand and he shouts, \\"Get your paws off me you damned dirty ape\\" to which Caesar shouts \\"NO!\\" (epic part in the movie) The apes escape the facility and begin causing havoc in the town.<br /><br />The apes head for the center where they were being tested on and free the apes, they go to the zoos and free those apes as well.  Then Caesar begins to lead them to the Redwoods, a place he loved to go as a child, to live happily.  Their final confrontation with the humans is on the Golden Gate Bridge.  The swat teams and tons of police are waiting for them to blow them away and a helicopter is flying around to try to shoot them.  But the apes plan a strategy to evade getting shot, some go under the bridge, some climb to the top to be hidden in the fog, the apes end up ambushing the humans and make their way past them to get to the Redwoods.  Once there Rodman runs after him into the Redwoods where at first he is attacked by another ape but is saved by Caesar, Rodman tells him it's time to come home.  To which Caesar says to him, \\"Caesar is Home.\\"<br /><br />This movie was simply amazing, the CGI effects were a nice change to the older movies which always had actors in suits.  I feel they were able to do more with the characters this way that wasn't possible in the past.  Although throughout most of the movie Caesar doesn't say anything, you can always tell what his emotions are and what he's thinking.  You really connect to him and feel sorry for him, he is a very intelligent creature yet he is treated like a pet and later like a meaningless animal, which leads him to despise humans.  You would think the apes were supposed to be the bad guys in this movie but with that epic scene on the Golden Gate Bridge I was rooting for the apes all the way.  All they wanted was to go to the Redwood forest to swing in the trees lol, nothing more.<br /><br />This movie opened the door for several sequels and I can't wait, there were so many things left unanswered in the film, and I wanted to see more of the apes taking over, but sadly that didn't really happen in this film, you can tell this is just creating the basis for a line of sequels down the road.<br /><br />So, I loved this movie, and it isn't like the older ones, so if you were expecting that you will probably be disappointed.  But if you have an open mind I believe you will enjoy this movie as much as I did.lls him it's time to come home.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|In my search for a good alarm app, I noticed that there are numerous android alarm apps available, however many feature flashy and bloated interfaces that just serve to make the app larger less and less responsive depending the device being used.  All android alarm apps are programmed to start at boot, so having a large alarm app always running in the background may adversely affect a device's performance.    With Alarm Clock Xtreme, the programmers at Angle Labs have created an app that cuts out all the unneeded flashy interfaces and leaves what is most important, while offering extra features of it's own.  Namely, there are options to prevent a user from turning off the alarm by accident and falling back to sleep.  With the ability to set a max number of snoozes and require math problems (of varying difficulty) to turn off alarms, users have no excuse for not getting out of bed on time with this app at their side.    I highly recommend this app to all android users regardless of the device.  It's lightweight footprint and full feature set make it the perfect companion for any android device user.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Madonna is in a zone with these songs because her voice blended well with the melodies and other arrangements; I think the music could stand alone as instrumentals but her voice complimented each tune.  I think this set of tracks blend signature themes of 70s funk bass riffs and disco tempos with 80s new wave synthesizers with 90s lyrical optimism.  It's a solid album that is best listened to sitting down at home with high performing headphones.  I use Sennheisers.  Buy it, check it out from your public library, or listen to it on any streaming music service (then buy it!)

0812973992|2.0|Let me just say that there's no question that Colum McCann is a gifted writer. His use of sensory imagery rates up there with the best, and he should be given all the plaudits he can get for that. Sometimes, though, he certainly does stumble over a sentence or two in the book, and those moments do stand out. That isn't a huge problem, though. Many books have the occasional head-scratcher moment that seems out of step within context.  On the downside, this book reeks of pretension. Sure, it was released to the fanfare of the literary world, but I just can't seem to get into it. From the opening vignette placing special importance on Allen Ginsberg's Howl (a wonderful poem) throughout the rest of the book, McCann just seemed to reference things that were far beyond the scope of this book and are lightyears ahead in terms of quality.  Furthermore, I wish McCann would remove himself completely from the book, instead of popping up every now and then. It seems out of place with the book and does not contribute. In addition, the disjointed narrative seems, as a whole, annoying instead of edifying. I'm no stranger to multiple narratives; Thomas Pynchon is my favorite author, and there are many movies that I love which feature numerous excursions from the realm of traditional storytelling. However, in all of those examples, the multiple narratives provide depth to a wide cast of characters. Even in Coffee & Cigarettes, the Jim Jarmusch film, there is the unifying idea of the benefit of conversations held over the titular \\"meal\\", as well as the glorification of the average person, equating them with celebrities. In this book, the multiple narratives seem to exist only to add exponentially more platitudes and cliches about beauty in decay and life on a tightrope.  In summary, while this book may be gorgeously written, its in-your-face-here-I-am-LOOK-AT-ME symbolism and pretentious nature make it tinny, flat, and annoying. Colum McCann would do better to work on the depth of his narratives instead of flexing his prose muscles.    Also, for the record, anyone who likes this style of writing and would like a challenging and rewarding book should check out Thomas Pynchon's first novel, V. In my opinion, that novel is the perfect \\"New York novel\\" because it is the most like New York: sprawling, global, bizarre, and a testament to the profane and everyday man.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I watched this not really knowing what to expect.  All I knew was that it was a BBC historical drama/romance.  I am SO GLAD that I watched it.  I love it just as much as the BBC production of Pride & Prejudice (the one with Colin Firth)-and that is saying something since I LOVED LOVED LOVED that miniseries.  Well, this one is a bit more dramatic.<br />  Basically, its a love story that takes place between two people who are very very very very different.  Margaret Hale goes with her family to the North to an Industrial town filled with factories.  There she meets John Thornton (played by the swoon-worthy Richard Armitage).  She dislikes how he runs his cotton mill, and doesn't hesitate to tell him.  Over the course of the miniseries he starts to fall for her and thinks he isn't good enough for her high morals and values.  As their relationship changes, so does the town.  The mill workers go on strike.  There is some violence on both sides.<br />  I just LOVE this miniseries.  The acting was fantastic.  This miniseries brought the amazing actor Richard Armitage to my attention.  So now Mr. Thornton has a place right next to Mr. Darcy (sigh).  Okay, no more gushing, but seriously, this is amazing!  I definitely recommend it.  Don't be put off by the slow pacing in the beginning, it gets so much better and the pace does pick up.<br /><br />ENJOY :)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I don't typically read sci-fi, but I gave this book a shot at the recommendation of Wil Wheaton, who narrated the audio version and was talking the book up on his blog. And I'm so glad I did!    True, it's not really an overly original story (the specifics are, but the overall plot isn't), and the prose is a bit unpolished, but I was completely engaged the entire time I was reading this book, and that's saying a lot, especially given that it's a genre I don't typically read. It's been a very, very long time since I was this engaged in a story. Thumbs up and a big thanks to both Ernest Cline for the story and to Wil for the recommendation!

0671891634|4.0|Most memorable books of investing provide you a first-hand insight into the minds of Wall Street's successful and storied investors.  Beating the Street is no exception.  It gives us an opportunity to peer into the philosophy of one of Wall Street's greatest investors ever, Peter Lynch.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with Peter Lynch, he headed Fidelity's flagship Magellan Fund from 1977 to 1990.  His track record is still today a legend, having given investors a nearly 30% compounded return during his tenure.  Beating the Street is Peter's autobiographical chronicle on how his investment strategies developed and evolved as he grew the fund from obscurity into a multi-billion dollar juggernaut.<br /><br />I find the beginning chapters of the book very relatable and eye opening.  Peter has a very down-to-earth style of talking about his life as a portfolio manager and has no shame in sharing the lessons learned from his investing missteps.  I find it interesting that he never really had any set strategy for diversification and didn't really pick stocks to weight his selections among certain industries or types of investment.  Rather, he just studied hundreds of different stocks looking for underlying fundamentals that seemed favorable.  He never really distinguishes himself as a \\"growth investor\\" or \\"value investor\\", but contrasts the semantics between the two in his early chapters.  I would consider him to be a growth investor since he focuses strongly on long term increases in earnings and dividends.  Many of Peter Lynch's methodologies sound similar to much of what is presented in Jim Cramer's books.  However, I would characterize Peter's delivery and presentation much closer to \\"sane money\\" than \\"mad money\\".<br /><br />The writing style is very personable, and I like how most of the book could probably be understood by a fifth grader.  But that is not to say the book is too simplistic.  Later chapters go into more detail with the financial metrics Peter looks for in a company - something that both amateurs and professional investors could find insightful.<br /><br />The fact that Beating the Street was published in 1993 is no disadvantage, and in fact makes the book more interesting since Peter's stock picks can be viewed through the scope of time.  Curiously, many of the stocks that Peter recommends in this book are now defunct since the companies have been merged or taken over by larger entities.  Perhaps they were bought out because of the same attractive fundamentals that put them on Peter's radar.<br /><br />However, it should be noted that many of his picks went through tough times for investors not long after the book's publication.  One of his favorite stock picks, Supercuts, overstepped its capacity by expanding too aggressively.  By the mid-1990s, Supercuts was unable to make enough money to recoup the debt acquired from its rapid build-out.  In his pitch, Peter also didn't tackle the question of competition crowding out Supercuts since its business model was so easy to replicate.  Some of his other picks like Nucor or Cedar Fair are still publicly traded today, but have mostly traded sideways with bumpy ups and downs for the last 18 years.  Since the early 90s those stocks would have presented subpar returns to buy-and-hold investors.<br /><br />The poor performance observed by researching a handful of Peter's recommendations makes me wonder if the \\"50-baggers\\" and \\"200-baggers\\" that he ran across as a portfolio manager during the 80s could still exist in today's sideways market.  A cursory look at some of his favorite stocks mentioned in the book made me realize that stock performance in general during the 80s and early 90s was superior to the decades after.  Just look at the chart for Cracker Barrel, which returned almost 1900% in price appreciation from 1984 to 1993, but at its best only returned about 100% from 1993 to 2011.  Although this is a topic for further research, it makes me wonder whether Peter's principles still apply in today's stock market or whether they need some updating.<br /><br />The question of whether Peter's style still has the same effectiveness is why I am only giving the book four stars.  Has much really changed?  Would Peter still be able to generate annualized returns of 30% in today's sideways market?  We may never know.  I would love to see an updated edition with an epilogue from Peter on what he would do differently in today's environment and how he would change his recommendations given hindsight.r's principles still apply in today's stock market or whether they need some updating.<br /><br />The question of whether Peter's style still has the same effectiveness is why I am only giving the book four stars.

B0050CQY1W|4.0|I listened to this album the first day it came out and I did not like it. I cut off the album halfway through and was like, what? I waited for this? I vowed never to listen again. I was then searching for something new to listen to out of my Zune Marketplace and saw the album and decided to listen to it and you know, this is pretty dang good! Maybe I was in a mood when I heard it the first time which can definitely affect what I think about it. This album sounds more like something I would have heard between 1988-1992 and I love it!    1. 1+1: This is a soulful ballad that makes me want to turn the lights down low and enjoy with a loved one. The range was great and I absolutely loved it. This is a 5/5 for me.    2. I Care: I think anyone who have had their hearts broken by someone can relate to this song. I think this was smartly written and I give this a 5/5.    3. I Miss You: I did not enjoy the opening of the song, maybe the first few seconds, with the bad language. Once you get past that blip this is a nice song. I give this a 4/5 because of the beginning. The beginning does not even fit the song, seemed a little frivolous to add it. The ending went out a little incomplete as well. It just kind of faded out and I didn't like that.    4. Best Thing I Never Had: Not too fond of this song. Sounds more like a B-Side to me but it's not terrible. Mid-tempo and standard lyrics. For that this song scored a 3.5/5 with me.    5. Party: This song sounded a little like SWV's first album. Kind of a New Jack City sound to it and I liked it enough, but the song got a little annoying with the chorus. It's not the worst I have heard this year but if I heard this on the radio I would be more inclined to turn the station after a while. The rapping was not necessary either. In my opinion this is a 2.8/5 mainly because it gets annoying on extended listen and the rapping was not necessary.    6. Rather Die Young: This is not a bad track at all. The only gripe I have is that she strained her vocals on the chorus a little and that rubbed me a little wrong. Otherwise I found no issues on this one. 4.5/5    7. Start Over: I enjoyed this track. Again, however, she strained her vocals throughout the song and that would make it un-listenable for some. 3.8/5    8. Love on Top: This track actually makes me feel like I am listening to a song in the 80's. It's alright. She yells on these vocals a little towards the end and the style of singing feels like it needs to be pulled back for a more relaxed vibe. 2.5/5    9. Countdown: This song is not making me feel like the 80's. Sounds like something in 2007 with an 80's beat. Upbeat and I actually like it. 4.8/5    10. End of Time: Another mid-tempo song. It's okay, definitely not the worst on the album. Why does she yell on this song too? -_- 3.8/5    11. I Was Here: A ballad I actually have grown to love. I think everyone thinks about what will become of their legacy when they leave the Earth. What is left behind? How will you be remembered? Will anyone even care? I think this is thought-provoking and I enjoyed it. 5/5    12. Run the World (Girls): When I first heard this song I hated it. I laughed and thought, here lies Beyonce, she had a great career but retirement is upon her when she finds out how much this song is hated. To be honest, one day I was sitting outside on my break listening to my mp3 player on the shuffle option and this song came on and I fell in love with it. This is a love it/hate it song. Not really gray area. I do not know why it was on the album because it didn't fit the theme at all. She should have kept the album at 11 songs and released this as a separate single. My rating on this song is 5/5    To be honest, this album was not as bad as the 1 star raters would want you to think. It's very intuitive in sound and I appreciate the throwback sound. Now to some honesty. Beyonce has not progressed in her lyrics in the least. She showed some sign in 1+1 but because she is a happily married woman I thought she was going to put out an album that showcased a more mature sound and lyric and in that department I was let down. I understand that she wants to cater to the younger demographic but she somewhat turns her back on the demographic that is aging with her music. She has amazing vocals and she is an amazing singer, but she needs to stop straining her voice on the songs and screaming because that kills the mood of her songs. I think this was a great effort and lyric-wise sounds like what is being put out but here's the thing, I expected a better than standard effort from Beyonce. This is not the worst album I have heard all year but it's not necessarily in my top 5 either for that reason. I am 27 years old and I am looking for a more mature sound and unfortunately that no longer includes Beyonce's music.

It looks the same, with only minor variations in color. It plays the same too, but that could be said for just about any standard defense type game. I don't know if one is ripping off the other, but so far ZDefense looks like a supped up version of HexDefense. An extra tower type has been added, and each tower can up upgraded a bit more. Special hexes add to the differences. The explosions are nice visually, the sound effects very like an 80s Atari game. No background music with this title, but it does have an online score bragging mechanism. The challenge level offered will keep you on your toes, even on the easy and normal difficulty settings.<br /><br />Hopefully you have found this review helpful.

B0055IU4GM|5.0|I doubt many would mention John Hiatt and Alice Cooper in the same sentence but I will because in my opinion both have had careers spanning many decades and yet at this stage of the game, both regularly continue to deliver some of their finest music within their respective genres. I've been listening to John since the \\"Slow Turning\\" days and he consistently writes good songs and while the scope isn't all that broad, his songs are just some of the best ever written. I will admit that at first I had a tough time putting Kevin Shirley together with John Hiatt, but damn if this record doesn't sound absolutely outstanding without compromising or manipulating the artist's creativity in any way. In fact I believe Shirley gets a little something extra out of John on this recording and whoever teamed these guys up deserves a big thumbs up. I'll skip the track by track reviews because that's all too subjective, and if you're here reading these reviews you're already a Hiatt fan, so what are you waiting for? Buy the disc, pop it in the car or iPod and let your mind wander to wherever John Hiatt takes you!

0688163173|5.0|I have always loved the idea of trying to figure out the mystery as the main character does the same and then try to figure out if that main character is who we're told.  Twists, turns, and revelations abound in this fantastic novel by Dennis Lehane.  Lehane has always had a handle on stories taking place in Boston, and while this does to a degree,  the location of the book, Shutter Island, might actually be a character itself.  Overall, the books weaves in and out of dreams and reality and it is never confusing except for the protagonist.  Its hard for me to say how much I enjoyed this book.  Great stuff!

B0006Q1ULQ|3.0|2.5-3 stars    Baudolino is a clever look at how religious mythology starts and convinces those who invent it in the first place.  However, it just dragged on and on and became extremely repetitive in the sense that Eco got his point across in the first couple hundred pages. He didn't need to keep hammering it home, 'adventure' after 'adventure'. A much condensed version would have been rated much higher.    I felt I had to finish this book for some reason but kept picking up others in the meantime. In all I think it took 9 months to get through. This is my first Eco book (I also have The Name of the Rose on the shelf) and I wonder if they all have this problem.
B003Y5H53S|3.0|Even my daughter (8 years old) commented on the language.  It is totally unnecessary in a children's movie.  We enjoyed the plot...several funny scenes....interesting perspective-going from \\"pet\\" to \\"hero\\" We were also able to use it as an opportunity to discuss issues in the movie for example, how disappointed the townspeople were when they found out they had been lied to. The negatives can be turned into positives with a little parent involvement.
0156029065|3.0|2.5-3 stars    Baudolino is a clever look at how religious mythology starts and convinces those who invent it in the first place.  However, it just dragged on and on and became extremely repetitive in the sense that Eco got his point across in the first couple hundred pages. He didn't need to keep hammering it home, 'adventure' after 'adventure'. A much condensed version would have been rated much higher.    I felt I had to finish this book for some reason but kept picking up others in the meantime. In all I think it took 9 months to get through. This is my first Eco book (I also have The Name of the Rose on the shelf) and I wonder if they all have this problem.
014017821X|5.0|The Bloody Chamber is a great little collection and the first book of Carter's that I read.  In it, she re-envisions some of the old fairy tales of Europe into pieces with a feminist slant, but there is much more to Carter than feminism.  She was a great writer.  Carter's books tend to be brief.  Her longest book is Wise Children, at only 240 pages.  She won top literary prizes in Britain with novels that were actually much shorter than that.  I have to respect a writer like that.    The collection features The Company of Wolves, from which story Carter developed a screenplay for the movie of the same name.  The movie is now a cult classic in itself.  It is by far my favorite story in the book.  It's pacing and characterization are expert.  The language in that story is poetic and lyrical.  What else can a reader ask for?    A lot of Carter's work belongs to a specific subcategory of gothic horror called \\"grand guignol.\\"  They tend to be extremely gory and gross, but with much style and consideration for aesthetics.  The Company of Wolves is a good example.  Even though the story features a lot of bloodshed, it is told with beautifully lyrical language and evokes a bucolic setting of England's slightly more innocent past.    I recommend this collection to anyone interested in gothic literature, women writers, and good writing.
B003YF9PWC|4.0|If you're a big fan of the film get the 2 DVD special collector's edition.  It has all sorts of commentaries and featurettes including the fight choreography and a tribute to Burgess Meredith.  Stallone's commentary is wonderful to listen to.  This is a five star film, but I deduct one for this blu ray's lack of extras.  The extra DVD only has the film with no commentary or extras of any kind.

0618918248|5.0|The book is a quick read, and not nearly as dry as you'd expect.  While it largely deals with the lack of scientific merit in all brands of creationism, it also acts as a hilarious overview of the most common (and silly) indictments and quips you'll hear from the frequently irrational creationist.    Dawkins, as always, is quite the \\"radical atheist\\".  He makes no apologies for his scientific and logical estimations.  Some might find him caustic (he does address this in the book), but it does help frame the rest of what you've heard from him.
B0000024W3|4.0|1970 was a year where many of the events of the 60's came to a head. On the social front we saw things such as the end of the Black Panthers as well as the shooting of students at Kent State. Now on the musical end of things the people who had encouraged much of this activity through their music were looking to focus on their individual art rather than being inspirations for their listeners. Turning inward was part of that. Also the idea that maybe,just maybe the 60's revolutions had gone about as far as they could go. This was the world into which Bob Dylan threw out this album. Seeing himself as less of a cultural icon at this point and more of a musicians musician to a degree-someone who would try out new ideas on musical terms and not make the message quite as huge a priority. That was counter to the way pop music was going at this time. And the fact that this album was something of a patchwork quilt,consisting of both live and studio numbers,many of which were interpretations of folk-rock hits of others made this a hard sell. A lot of Bob's 60's audience probably fell away with this. Even to this very day. Honestly? It's not half bad an album at all on it's own terms.<br /><br />  It begins with \\"All The Tired Horses\\",a Bob Dylan song where not only is he not singing but the same line is repeated again and again. Of the studio songs he wrote himself \\"Alberta\\",\\"The Mighty Quinn\\" and \\"Living The Blues\\" are three strong examples,all showcasing that soul-folk/country fusion he'd been working with during the late 60's. Covers of \\"Earling Morning Rain\\" and \\"Days Of 49\\" actually kind of return to a folkier flavor to a degree. Some might say it was a strange choice for him to do a version of \\"Blue Moon\\" but he reinvents the torchy original as more of a rootsy blues type tune. Two live versions of \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" and a rockier electric version of \\"She Belongs To Me\\" taken from the Isle of Wight concert find him singing his own standards in his newer,more soulful and less abrasive vocal style. \\"Wigwam\\" is a relative rarity for Bob Dylan-an textural instrumental showcasing his already established strong songwriting abiltity. \\"Woogie Boogie\\" is another instrumental reminding us that bluesy boogie woogie piano is literally one step away from rock n roll. And this is one tune that does rock n roll for sure.<br /><br />  On many levels by doing this type of album,one that reflects more his influences as well as his own past it was a good looking glass for him to gaze at his own musical future. With only a the abstract,almost cubist painting on the cover,the literal embodiment of the album title on the cover adds to the sense of anonymity Bob seemed to be going for with this album. He wasn't trying to make any type of grand point to society or pursue any kind of creative crusade. He was only exploring his musical past basically and letting on join him on the adventure. And for his little break from \\"relevance\\" he becomes everyone's whipping boy basically. Ah well,so goes Bob Dylan's career I guess. In purely creative terms using this album as something of his audio scrapbook of what was going on with him musically at the time did pay off. It kept him out there for one when most artists like him had either died or flat out given up music completely. And even for people who wish this album never got made,there are not only plenty of highlights but also a strong trail of his own making for Bob Dylan to follow in the coming years.standards in his newer,more soulful and less abrasive vocal style. \\"Wigwam\\" is a relative rarity for Bob Dylan-an textural instrumental showcasing his already established strong songwriting abiltity. \\"Woogie Boogie\\" is another instrumental reminding us that bluesy boogie woogie piano is literally one step away from rock n roll.

0685113914|3.0|I got this recording so that I could read along in the book to help myself review my French. I figured it would help with my pronunciation and maybe understanding. However, he reads so very fast, that I can barely keep up! Also, I don't really care for the voices he uses for the different characters. (I've heard this read in German and I loved that version, so it's not that I'm prejudiced against hearing it in another language.)    Another problem is that it is recorded in mp3 format, so I can't fast forward or rewind on my disc player.    I'm not sure I'd recommend this to someone hoping to review their French. If you have any suggestions on that topic, please let me know!
B004QMW1NM|5.0|I rarely buy albums. I had heard about Naked and Famous through the \\"Related Videos\\" section on youtube after listening to songs by The Xx. I listened to \\"Young Blood\\" and was pretty impressed straight off the bat. I looked them up here on Amazon and saw what a good rating this CD had received, liked the music samples, and especially the $6 price for a full CD. I took the leap and decided to purchase my 2nd album of the year through Amazon. I am so happy I did. I have had this CD playing on repeat on my iPod since. Their music is very unique. As one reviewer put it earlier, one song seems like Radiohead, then the next like Passion Pit and so on. Its very hypnotizing stuff. Awesome CD, more than worthy of the 6 dollar price tag.
B004UHF51S|5.0|This is certainly one of the finest recordings of the decade. Every aspect of it is damn near perfect. In fact, it gets my vote as one of the best of all time! I simply can't say enough good things about it. If you like Michael Franks, if you like his unique ability to take you to a different, previously unexplored place of bliss, you simply have to own this CD. It's a tour de force, a literal \\"heaven on earth.\\" Don't believe me? Try it, you'll owe me forever!

B000FC1IPO|3.0|I bought this book because I thought it would be a great read... something I could relate to. I was totally and completely wrong. I didn't relate to the fact that the main character in this book has SUCH a high paying job. She's not a \\"real\\" working mom - not that she's \\"fake\\" either.  She has a nanny. No offense to the mothers out there that have it as tough as Kate did, but really. Talk to me about working full time, having 2 school aged kids both of whom play sports and a baby, and cannot afford the luxury of a nanny. There are some mothers our there that have it so much harder. Demanding job, less pay, we have to buy our OWN stuff from the super market and not ask the nanny to do so and we take our own children to soccer (or ballet). I don't know. I had a lot of different mixed feelings about it. I thought there was some humor, hence the three stars. All in all, it's not a terrible book. It's not a great book. The cynicism about motherhood (lets be honest, we all have our moments), is the best part of the book. Other than that... it's just not relate-able to a lot of mothers out there.
0553801473|4.0|This book was fantastic... that being said the storyline is so broad and comprehensive that this book unlike some of the earlier books has no defining denouement. Nothing gets totally resolved... it leaves  you halfway through so many storylines without ending something like the battle for the wall ended a previous book. Thus I believe the lower star rating than you m ay have expected. If the entire story were one text this would have been written just as well as any of the rest of the story... it captures your attention and imagination... Fantastic and far reaching character development... I think it goes to the credit of the author that if you just picked this book up without reading the other books first you would be TOTALLY lost. This is an EPIC tale and reading any chunk of it out of context will leave your head spinning. This book seems to end too soon for any one thread or story line to carry the book on its own. That being said... PLEASE do not make me wait another five years or so for the next installment...

I guess the publishers don't want to kill the goose who keeps laying those golden eggs (and could do so for another 2 or 3 books). This series began with such promise. I'm giving this installment one star, as a way of saying \\"snap out of it\\" and give us the goods next time!  What happened to the great story teller of A Storm of Swords? There are still some wonderful characters here. How about letting them do something when the next book comes out five or six years from now!

B0000CABBW|4.0|I can get rather insulted when I read reviews from people who are too ignorant to fully assess the meaning of a film before they make a blanket statement that really doesn't apply whatsoever.  It's infuriating because you can tell that the individual taking the time out of their day to review and persuade others of their opinion don't even really have a legitimate opinion because they don't really understand what they are talking about.  That isn't to say that someone who doesn't like this movie is wrong (I don't particularly love it either) but if you are going to discredit something you should be able to give a legitimate reason as to WHY you don't like it; right?<br /><br />So if you make a statement like `if you hate men this is the flick for you' you better be able to back that up with a reason as to why this film promotes the hatred of men.  But, Nor (yes, you), you missed the point of this film entirely (although I will credit you with at least raising the concern that this film is predictable, and you are right since it does take the `politically correct route' as you state, but please think your thoughts thoroughly for you make claims that hold no weight and make your entire review lose authenticity).<br /><br />`Whale Rider' is not a film set to diss tradition, nor is it a man hating bash against the elderly committed to their heritage.  `Whale Rider' is a beautifully told tale of a young New Zealander named Pai who is seeking love and affections and mutual respect from her grandfather.  Pai is facing great obstacles when dealing with the man.  Being practically raised by her grandparents after a fatal birthing leaves her twin brother and her mother dead, and her father emotionally unstable, Pai has faced a resentment from her grandfather for saddling him with unwanted responsibility.  Although she was considered a burden, he grew to love her.  But, due to traditions, Pai could not be groomed for future leadership (a privilege exclusively for firstborn males) and so when Pai attempts to train as well, her grandfather begins to fall back into his resentful feelings towards her.<br /><br />While I am not one to wholly embrace the overabundance of `girl power' (not because I don't believe in strong females or their empowerment but because I don't feel that Hollywood ever gives the subject any real dignity), I must say that `Whale Rider' understands how to make the subject feel heartfelt and moving.  That has a lot to do with the powerful performance given by Keisha Castle-Hughes.  She really delivers a wallop of a performance; one with depth (her eyes are so piercing) and just purity of soul.  She never forces it, for every emotion spills with a feeling of genuineness.<br /><br />When she cries, you cry.<br /><br />In the end I must say that `Whale Rider' is a beautifully made film.  It does have a predictability about it and an overwhelming feeling of manipulated emotions, especially on the outset, but they are never gratuitous and never take away from the overall impact of the film; in fact, in a way they aid it.Pai attempts to train as well, her grandfather begins to fall back into his resentful feelings towards her.

B004A8ZWSS|1.0|Here's the thing; this should have been amazing.  First you have the cast.  Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp are two of the most bankable stars in Hollywood, and they are both talented (albeit overrated, but talented).  They ooze this charisma that makes their actorly flaws seem irrelevant at times.  Then you have the director.  Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has one other feature length film under his belt; 2006's Oscar winning film `The Lives of Others'.  That film is amazing and his directing of it was flawless (he should have been nominated in the directing category).  Then you have the story; a solid mix of action and mystery and you have that beautiful setting; Venice.<br /><br />None of it works.<br /><br />The setting, while beautiful, feels cheap.  The actors, while talented, lack any real chemistry and don't evoke any emotions.  Angelina relies on her fading good looks to keep us engaged and Depp tries to play quirky again and misfires.  Sadly, Paul Bettany has been further reduced to stereotypical `obstacle' and does absolutely nothing with the role (quick, Russell Crowe, come to his rescue).  The direction is also just standard and uninspired.  It felt like almost every frame was ripped from a better Cary Grant/Alfred Hitchcock collaboration.  The story had all the elements for a nice capper and yet it felt underdeveloped and stale.<br /><br />Angelina does nothing by pout her lips and smolder.  Depp does nothing but try to pull off ignorant.  Bettany does nothing by bark into the phone.<br /><br />I liked the twist at the end even if it felt too predictable (and nonsensical at that), but the construction of the film as a whole was a total mess.  I'm just so upset over this.  I really wanted von Donnersmarck to follow up his brilliant debut with something a little more profound, or at least a little more epic (considering the genre and stars he chose).  Instead, `The Tourist' feels too tepid and too insipid to matter in the slightest.  I think the funniest thing about this movie is the fact that the Globes nominated it in the Comedy category.  It's not funny (at least not intentionally).  It didn't deserve to be nominated for anything, but the fact that they changed the whole genre to fit their need to nominate big name stars is just hilarious.<br /><br />Skip this one.he fact that the Globes nominated it in the Comedy category.

0062060554|1.0|This book is dull and predictable. I started skimming about half way through just trying to see if anything ever happens. By the time it does, you know what's coming.  And, it takes forever to get there. I am shocked at the good reviews of this book. It was not suspensful or thrilling at all. If you wnat to read a good memory loss novel, try The Raw Shark Texts. It is everything this book was not-mainly an exciting page turner.
B00005JMCN|1.0|Probably the best thing I can say about `Seabiscuit' is that it is a handsome film.  By that I mean that its production values are pretty outstanding.  It is a glossy and very pretty film that captures an authenticated `vintage' appeal thanks to the beautifully designed costumes and crisp set pieces.  That aside, the film is not anything to write home about.  It is disengaging and completely stale in taste.  The earnestness to become something superficially uplifting strips this film of any real soul.  Instead it feels tired and plagued by lack of real detail.  The narration is useless, never really providing any useful information (narration is tricky, and it can become a source of endless irritation when it continually insists of telling you what you already know) and the overall flow of the film becomes stagnant thanks to a lack of endearment or charisma.  Tobey Maguire is one of those actors who struck gold once with a role that was made for him (`Spider-Man') but his persona doesn't bode well with anything else.  He is a blank bore here.  The supporting cast works decent enough here, with Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges and William H. Macy adding some spice to the events (even if it is in clich&eacute;s) but they can't rescue this film from itself.  `Seabiscuit' had potential, but it squandered it in a sappy script that lost sight of what made the true story (and apparently the source material for this screenplay) so beloved; the horse.  This is one of those films that seem too intent on winning Oscars (it was nominated for seven) and less concerned with actually representing it's star (the HORSE) in a way that does him any justice.

B002GOAH1U|4.0|So the film is a predictable clich&eacute;, but it's so much fun and Amanda Bynes (I just heart her) is just so charming in her ridiculousness.  I swear that she plays the same dim-witted cutie in every film, but it works for her.  She likes to fall a lot, which can get old, but whatever; I like watching her.  She's funny in a way that makes you feel like you've known her for years and `that's just the way she is'.  The story here is a tad `overdone'.  Bynes' plays a young girl who has lived her whole life with her musician mother, longing for the day when she would meet her father.  Her father, it turns out, is a British lord who has no idea she even exists.  So, young Daphne slips out of her mother's sight and high-tails it to Britain to confront her father for some much needed `daddy/daughter time'.  Problem is that her father is about to marry a terrible woman who has a terrible daughter of her own.  If you think that this won't end with a happy ending for all (well, at least for all the good people) then you obviously don't watch that many movies (more power to you) but whatever; it's the getting there that counts and both Bynes and Firth are incredibly charming and wonderful to watch.  Sure, the cinemaphile in me is screaming \\"HOW DARE YOU WATCH THIS AND LIKE IT\\" but the realist in me embraces the fact that not every movie is going up for Oscars.  This one makes me smile, and that's got to count for something!
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Case is great! I was looking for something really small, but fit my Canon 7D and my main lens (17-55 2.8) for times i did not want to carry my main case (if i was hiking, walking downtown, etc.). This is a great small case for this purpose.     If you have alot of equipment and more lens, and looking for a primary case for your equipment, this is not one you should get since it was not designed for that purpose. I have a 580ex II and a 50 1.4, so I expected that it will not fit.     What i really love about this is that it's small enough to fit in my backpack and act as a protector!

I really do feel sorry for people who can't watch this movie and not just enjoy it and not worry about the plot the whole time.<br />All the main characters were well designed and the voices were well matched.

0691142165|4.0|I finished reading This Time is Different by Reinhart and Rogoff and I want to share some of my thoughts. Rather than a detailed recap or a sermon about what needs to be done from a policy-making perspective, I want to talk about the lessons traders can take away from this book.<br /><br />If you're unfamiliar with the book, it's essentially an academic analysis of episodes of sovereign default. It's not an enjoyable narrative but it's consistently interesting in the way it continually slaps you in the face with the central premise of the book: warning signs of crisis are always there and that they're always missed, ignored or dismissed because `this time is different'.<br /><br />Importantly, it shows 1) How bank-led financial crisis are far more expensive and more difficult to escape than economic crisis. They note that on average in post WWII financial crises, real government debt increased an average of 86% in the three years following the onset of the crisis. 2) How agonizing and difficult it is for governments to escape indebtedness. Once debt-to-GDP ratio hits 100% it cuts heavily into growth and it becomes very difficult to escape a debt spiral. Countries don't grow their way out of debt burdens, the authors show.<br /><br />These are important points to consider as the US approaches the 100% debt-to-GDP threshold. An important definition the authors make about default is that it is not always an outright denial of external (foreign) debt but often occurs as domestic default, which they define as allowing persistent inflation above 20%. For the US -- which holds minimal foreign-currency-denominated debt and manageable foreign-held USD debt -- it would be through runaway inflation that `default' would occur.<br /><br />Critically for us, Reinhart and Rogoff note that a currency crash generally precedes a period of runaway inflation. In the US, you could argue that we have already entered the early stages of the currency collapse. The Fed is debasing the USD through quantitative easing while trade and fiscal deficits are generally ignored. It's not hard to envision a USD crash in the next decade based on the historical examples of the book. In fact, we view it as the likely event that transforms the current path (a Japanese-style era of near-zero growth) into a depression.<br /><br />One passage focuses not just on leaders, but also how traders tend to miss crisis signals: \\"The greatest barrier to success is the well-entrenched tendency of policy-makers and market participants is to treat the signals as irrelevant archaic residuals of an outdated framework, assuming that old rules of valuation no longer apply.\\"<br /><br />Bank supervision is an example that jumps out at me because it applies to traders and the current situation. The authors show that governments need to more closely monitor and supervise banks and other financial institutions. Continually, leaders reassure the public that financial institutions are sound even as they struggle and as they collapse.<br /><br />Looking at the current Eurozone and US situation it's easy to sit back and say `this time is different'. This time we have stress tests. This time the lessons of the recent financial crises are still at the forefront of leaders' minds.<br /><br />As a trader, you have to look at this book and not be moved by the urgency of the authors who talk about the importance of overhauling institutions and putting in safeguards but instead recognize that `this time will be the same.'<br /><br />We bring up bank supervision because it's tempting at the moment to believe banks have rid themselves of risky assets. That the stress tests were comprehensive and proof that leaders want transparency and that they know what's on the balance sheets of all the systemically-important institutions.<br /><br />Governments never truly want to know what's on the balance sheet because  they're scared of what they might find. It's in their short-term interest to ignore the problems and hope they go away. For them, it's easy to believe that this time is different because it's in their interest.<br /><br />Another point to heed is that domestic government debt is opaque and often the source of episodes of hyper-inflation. In the US, this type of domestic debt would include municipal and state obligations. These are both already strained. The other obvious areas flashing warning signs are entitlements, especially medicare and social security. Rather than deal with these problems  actively, the US government procrastinate and the passive response will be an inflationary episode. Again, we have to emphasise that a currency crisis will almost certainly precede the inflation.<br /><br />Finally, the one question that the authors leave unanswered (due to lack of data) and we are struggling with is the effect of counter-cyclical government stimulus in a financial crisis. Their data showed Kenysian style stimulus in an economic crisis diminishes the severity of the crisis but this may not be the case in a financial crisis.<br /><br />The only example of a counter-cyclical response that can be examined is Japan. The result has been twenty years of economic malaise, an extremely large government debt and no easy way forward. It's an unenviable situation but it is impossible to say that an austerity and a laissez-faire attitude toward the economy would have provided a better outcome. We believe the past twenty years would have been much worse. But we can also argue that the outlook for the upcoming twenty years would be much better if Japan's debts were at sustainable levels.<br /><br />Counter-cyclical government spending has characterized the 2008 financial crisis and it has inarguably (in my mind) had positive effects on growth. For us, the question now is which countries can resist a second round of counter-cyclical spending in favour of austerity? We believe these will be the best currencies to be invested in over the long term.<br /><br />First, we believe there is almost zero chance the US government slows spending. The US electorate demands action from the government and the upper classes are terrified of high unemployment. At the core, there is no genuine appetite for austerity. Stalled growth will diminish revenue and/or spending will continue to accelerate until a period of default by inflation.<br /><br />As the US implements additional rounds of counter-cyclical stimulus spending, American leaders will attempt to influence on other countries to do the same. From their perspective, if they can persuade other countries to spend, the positive effect on global and domestic growth will be much greater.<br /><br />So the question is: which countries have a political system and population capable of resisting US influence?<br /><br />This is a difficult question to answer. We believe that many governments did not want to introduce stimulus spending in the first round of the financial crisis. Coming out of the G20 meetings in Toronto, however, leaders from all countries agreed to increase spending. A second such agreement is unlikely, instead, the US will push this agenda in a one-on-one fashion.<br /><br />If you believe it will be easy for countries to resist the influence of the US, you're wrong. The US could easily implement policies that would isolate and hurt countries who fail to cooperate. Efforts like the `Buy America' provisions in the first round of US stimulus are an easy sell to the American public and international trade organizations are not robust enough or fast moving enough to stop even the most obvious flouting of international trade agreements.<br /><br />The US can easily introduce damaging tariffs based on shaky legal definitions as was done to Canada in the softwood lumber affair. The case was before international tribunals as the US collected illegal tariffs for nearly a decade and the funds were never repaid.<br /><br />For this reason, we feel Canada is especially vulnerable. Whilewe believe the Canadian populace is somewhat deficit-averse, many of the lessons from an austerity push in the early 90s have already been forgotten. Less than a month after the large miss in US GDP and the downgrade by S&P, the government has already been asked if it will spend more to stimulate the economy and abandon plans to balance the budget in 2015. So far the answer has been no, but it certainly wasn't the definitive `no!' that would reassure us, especially given the record deficits the current government produced over the past three years.<br /><br />We feel a similar fate is in store in the UK. David Cameron was elected on an austerity budget but the public still hasn't felt the impacts of spending cuts. Events like the London riots will grow and the government will lose credibility when recession returns and the drop in revenues undermines any deficit savings from spending cuts (in the eyes of the public at least).<br /><br />If we have any optimism for major economies, it's in the Eurozone. This is the only area where political structures may be strong enough to resist the American influence. In this case, the US influence may be counteracted by the public and political desire to remain in the Eurozone. The banishment of a bad actor (like Greece) may go a long way to enforcing this goal. If governments can agree to hard limits on deficits it is likely to hurt European growth for the next five years but then set the stage for a lengthy period of outperformance.<br /><br />The lone area where we have genuine enthusiasm is Latin America, particularly the southern cone. The leaders and the public are extremely deficit averse after the episodes in the 90s. The United States and the IMF have minimal influence in this area because of prior failures and the economies there are growing fast enough to maintain political stability of if growth is below potential. At the moment, retail forex trading is largely confined to USD, JPY, EUR, CHF, CAD, AUD and NZD with the second tier including the Scandies, several Asian currencies and several others.

B004WY2M8I|5.0|What needs to be said about Anne Rice.  She is one of the best authors around.  I have read, and reread her books, each and every time they are just as wonderful.  You will love these stories, they are written with expertise, and are as revelant today as when they were published, maybe even more so.  If they can make epic movies, like ROOTS they should give these books a try.....wonderful
1400064287|4.0|Unfortunately, the brothers Heath give a nod to Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Tipping Point\\" as the basis for this book, but this book is very good.  It is principally about how good ideas can be created (crafted) such as to enhance their sticking power in peoples' minds.  With great real-world examples the reasons behind great marketing ideas can be scrutinized.  A must-read for those interested in marketing, sales, consumer behavior, or behavioral psychology.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|simply one of the best books i have ever read. Easily on par with works such as Hawaii by Michener and The Shadow of The Wind by Zafon.  It was an absolute pleasure to read.  Felt much more connected to characters than any other works by Steinbeck.  I absolutely recommend this book to fans of serious literature. This is, in my opinion, Steinbeck's masterpiece.
B005CDTOCU|5.0|The kids had to fend for themselves this weekend because I was wrapped UP in Tony's book! This inspiring and incredible journey made me laugh out loud and (several times) stop my husband so I could read a passage to him. I've been a Zappos fan from way back (praising their extraordinary customer service) and this solidifies it even more. LIke he says, if this is a \\"cult\\", I wanna be a part of it! Keep up the WOW, Tony and crew - you guys do it better than anyone!!

B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I brought this film along on a family reunion, and played it for the crowd on our Movie Night. We loved it and all had a good time. Even the younger kids were quiet. After \\"The Lives of Others\\", I'm sure critics were expecting more from director von Donnersmarck, but the fact remains that this was an enjoyable romp, beautifully photographed in and around Venice, and the story was fun. Is this fine director being \\"type-cast\\"? Is he not allowed to stretch?Forget it! The attractive cast and beautiful scenery and a fun (though a bit contrived) plot kept me watching with interest. Film snobs may be disappointed, but you just can't fool kids, and we \\"kids\\" of all ages enjoyed it a lot.

0553801473|2.0|I can't believe that this novel is the result of more than 5 years work by GRRM - honestly, the book is roughly 85% filler in which the plot barely progresses.  In my opinion ASOIAF fans would be better served reading a synopsis than trying to slog through the entire novel (which might sour you on the series as a whole).  Reading this book felt like work to me, and that's something that a book of fiction, and in particular, fantasy fiction should never feel like.

B004CR5TD0|4.0|This soulful piece,\\"dipped\\" in strong bass and off beat drum tracks, makes a statement. \\"Less is more\\".  It lives in its chord progressions and harmonies. Also its simple electronic drum tracks. At first listen songs like \\"Unluck\\"  and \\"I Never Learnt to Share\\" feel off beat but easy to adjust to, after another listen. The songs are well produced and their sounds encapsulate you, letting you feel the emotions that dwell in the notes. The only song I had a problem with was \\"Lindisfarne 1\\". I think the album woud've been better without that song. It was a nice idea, but it was too long and should've been a small intro like it was in his music video. The other songs were great but sometimes I felt as if maybe, just maybe it was too minimalistic. Maybe his sophomore album will be more interesting.

0553801473|2.0|Honestly, I couldn't believe that the book was over. I got it on Kindle, so I wasn't really aware of how far along in the book I was. I happened to glance down at the percentage line at the bottom, and I was 94% of the way through the book! I was shocked. I heard the book was over 1,000 pages, so how had I got through it so quickly? And how was the book ending when nothing actually happened?? Then it dawned on me-- all those pages that I had clicked my way through, because nothing was happening (or because Martin was going into painstaking detail describing someone being burned, raped, or mutilated). I had unwittingly skipped my way through the book.<br /><br />I was crushed. I had been looking forward to curling up with my favorite character: Daenerys and her dragons (as the title led me to believe), hopefully heading to Westoros to give the evil Cersei her due. (though Jaime I had started to grow fond of after that last book) But the dragons are chained up (except for an exciting scene in the fighting pits), and Daenerys has lost the fire she had when she double-crossed the slavers and burned them all in book three.<br /><br />Tyrion, my second favorite character (at least since Martin killed off/exiled/changed all the Starks), doesn't do a darn thing the whole book.<br /><br />Jon Snow proves himself totally unfit to command the Wall, and gets killed for it. But what else is he supposed to do when apparently there isn't a decent man of the Nights Watch left anyway??<br /><br />There are a whole bunch of new perspectives that I didn't care at all about. The problem with killing off all your main characters is that your readers are no longer emotionally involved in the story. So we (readers) don't feel bad about leaving all these newcomers to whatever fate Martin may have in store for them.<br /><br />I never thought I would say this about a thousand page book, but it ended too fast. It could have ended even sooner, but I kept expecting something to happen, so I kept reading. A good editor would have cut this down to 200 pages, tops. Frankly, I could have done without the whole book, except the scene where Daenerys first rides the dragon.
B0040JHLAY|5.0|These shoes have worked out wonderfully for my husband- he has a wide foot and requires a lot of support when running.  He had previously ran in the GTS 10 in the 3E, this new model provides the same great support he needs and a little extra room.  Good shoes for runners requiring support and a wider base.  Also, amazon had them to my house in 2 business days!  (I did not pay extra for speedy shippping or anything) FANTASTIC!

0316069353|1.0|Loved the Lincoln Lawyer but without giving too much away have to say Connelly absolutely ruined the main character Mickey for me in this one. Ending was not believable and was a total ruined set up.  Sorry Connelly but you loste for good on this one, will never buy another one of your books.  Awful!
B004L79VUI|1.0|This can't be the same person that wrote all those great songs for The Band. All of Robbie's solo stuff lacks the songwriting that was evident with The Band.  His stuff has been so avant-garde since his first release, it makes me wonder if he didn't get help in the eariler days like Levon and Rick claimed. Listen and file it away just like the others.
0345529057|5.0|I love George RR Martin becasue you never know when someone will be killed. Great characters which stir your imagination, nothing better!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|You are better off waiting for the next blu-ray set. I have cancelled the pre-order, and would recommend everyone doing the same. It's really pathetic what Lucas is doing. When the 3D versions come out the complete set will be released. Good night.
B003D83DPA|2.0|I was very diaappointed in this Blu-ray version. The video is very dark and grainy due to low lighting in the original recording. Audio was less than stellar on a surround sound processor. All sounds are delivered up front where crowd noises could have been handle on rear speakers. This Blu-ray version should have had enhannced visual and audio presentations; the technology is available.
0425241505|3.0|Dragon Bound is the story of Pia, a half human woman who has lived all her life avoiding other wyr and never letting anyone know who she really is. But she made a mistake and is blackmailed  into stealing something from the hoard of a dragon, specifically the most feared dragon, Dragos Cuelebre.<br /><br />The story starts with Pia, who has succeeded in stealing from Dragos and is running for her life. It's not too long until Dragos realizes he has been robbed, and starts searching for his thief. But he wasn't expecting a delicate and strange half-wyr woman.<br /><br />Pia was fun. I liked that she was in trouble but always tried to save her life. Even when she knew it was impossible to run from Dragos. She's brave and very independent, and she has a secret that nobody has to know.<br /><br />Dragos was the typical alpha male. I liked him only because he was a dragon, and the strongest, oldest and most feared wyr. Also, he's a millionaire. What's not to like about him? Of course he has a sweet side, one that not even him knew he had, and when he met Pia, he knows he doesn't want to kill her but explore her.<br /><br />I liked the story. It's full of different characters, and all of them with a distinctive personality. It has a lot of unexpected turns and I wasn't sure what was going to happen to Pia and Dragos. But it was obvious they were attracted to each other, and the romance between them was hot!<br /><br />But there were moments I couldn't help feeling the characters were a little bit ridiculous. For example, I felt like Dragos, who was feared by everyone, changed too much his personality. I always expect changes in the characters when they fall in love, but I thought like he was a different person.<br /><br />Overall, I think the Elder Races is going to be a series I'll enjoy. Although this book wasn't a favorite to me, I enjoy it and I can't wait to read Storm's Heart.
B000UAFDP2|4.0|First, I want to express my sincere thanks to the people who posted answers on various forums about the 'extended memory required' to play this disk. Their generosity of sharing their guidance and assistance is much appreciated by us all.<br /><br />Second, I must admonish Amazon for not having posted at least a note or some other notice about the issues with this disk. It is not, repeat not, a problem with your blu-ray player. Sony Entertainment has incorrectly mastered this disk and failed to issue a recall which is inexcusable.<br /><br />I have written Sony Entertainment and requested they offer all purchasers of this disk either a full refund or and exchange of the product for a disk without the extended memory requirement. BD-Live is an 'option' in the Blu_ray standard, IT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT and Sony Entertainment has violated the Blu_Ray player standard by issuing a disk that will not play without extended memory to support BD-Live.<br /><br />In short, SONY ENTERTAINMENT is LEGALLY REQUIRED to  send you either a disk that works without extended memory and/or to refund your purchase price.<br /><br />If you purchased this disk and are having problem playing it, then you MUST write Sony Entertainment and provide them the following information:<br /><br />1) The purchase information including the retailers name, date of purchase, and a copy of your receipt. If you cannot locate your receipt, then you MUST get the UPC code from tha disk sleeve the disk was shipped in.<br /><br />2) Provide a stamped-self addressed envelope if you are requesting a refund. If you wish a replacement disk, then include a 3x5\\" index card with your shipping address plainly printed (no cursive handwriting) or typed so Sony can send you a replacement disk.<br /><br />3) Use an 8.5\\" x 11\\" piece of paper and write to Sony Entertainment, (the mailing address is listed on your Blu-Ray case) and in BOLD, CAPITAL LETTERS underneath Sony mailing address, write the words on a single line: \\"RE: REPLACEMENT DISK REQUEST FOR STAR SHIP TROOPERS BLU-RAY DISK\\" . You can say whatever you want in the body of the letter, but in the body, in a single paragraph, write the following: \\" I am enclosing a copy of my proof of purchase and I am hereby requesting you send me a replacement Blu Ray disk to the shipping address included with this letter..\\"<br /><br />4) Mail you letter USPS Priority Mail with DELIVERY CONFIRMATION .. (cost about $5.00) keep a copy of the letter and your proof of purchase information.<br /><br />You should receive a replacement Blu-Ray disk from Sony or your refund in about six to eight weeks.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I read this on account of the great reviews, but it turned out to be mediocre young adult literature which aspires to Harry Potter, but doesn't succeed.  Big disappointment.

B00164GDD2|1.0|The grain/static in this Blu-Ray makes it unwatchable. Of all the Blu-Rays I own, it's the only one where I use my old DVD version (the original DVD release) instead. That's a travesty for such an adored film. The picture quality is awful. Don't waste your money.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|I remember stating in my review for Sgt. Pepper that it was the first great Beatles album but after going back over their earlier records, I would have to say that they are superb pieces of work that shouldn't be left out of their best albums list. Released in 1965, Rubber Soul has become my 2nd favorite Beatles record after Sgt. Pepper. While it may take a few listens to completly appreciate it, you will soon find yourself wearing this album out. There isn't a single bad track here and it showed The Beatles growing up a little bit and establishing that an album can be a work of art and not just a collection of hit songs. I remember reading that this album only took a mounth to record which is hard to believe but then again, each Beatles album sounds so fresh that it's hard to believe that any of them took over a couple of mounths to record and this album is the best example. Even though pretty much all of the songs only run at 2 to 3 mintues, you will be completly satisfied with each track. Their is a lot of passion in these songs, they are a fine example of maturity and even confidence in their music.<br /><br />It's hard to pick a favorite track but I would say \\"Norwegian Wood\\", \\"Nowhere Man\\", \\"I'm Looking Through You\\", \\"In My Life\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" are my top 5. Other gems include \\"Michelle\\", \\"Girl\\", \\"Drive My Car\\" and \\"Think For Yourself\\". While I have a lot left to learn about The Beatles, I can say that anyone who is passionate about music should check out these records but Rubber Soul is one that everyone must hear before they die.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|Pro Elite Wireless Controller for PS3    When I was given the chance to try this out I decided why not, I could use a new controller. After all one of my PS3 controllers is well broken so this was needed. So I waited for it to arrive and when it did I went right to work with it. Over multiple games I decided that this was indeed worth getting. The controller is basically the same as the PS3 version but looks more like the Xbox controller.    The obvious thing other than its size is the grip and for what it is worth I think it was a good idea. I didn't mind the texture of it and it did serve its purpose so I would give it thumbs up. All the buttons worked so that is always good and the triggers are great, and I didn't mind the pad. It does come with a USB for wireless play which is always fun and of course a cord for charging. I would say try this out if you prefer the 360 style controller but play the PS3.

1594744769|5.0|I read this book about two weeks ago in a one and a half day marathon. It has layer upon layer of stories developed so well within the main tale, I could not put it down. I read until almost 5 AM the first night and grabbed it up again first thing in the morning.     Please be willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy this book to its' fullest potential. It is not like anything that I have read in recent years and to say more would just spoil the fun for you. Enough has been written in these reviews already, so I will not go into more details here---JUST READ IT! And when is the sequel coming, for goodness sake?????

B0058OUJA4|5.0|My first thought was, \\"Hey, Hex Defense!\\" Only this has different maps and some different weapons, too. I guess Hex Defense was also a clone of something else so I'm not going to get upset about it. But the more I played it the more I enjoyed it. It is challenging and you tend to use blocking a lot more in this than you do on Hex Defense. The hexagons are smaller so you can fit more of them on the screen. It is almost like Hex Defense got a visual upgrade.    I liked it a lot and plan to play it a lot more in the future.

0143034901|4.0|The used book received was in very good condition and arrived rather quickly.  Thank you for offering it on Amazon.  The story \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is extremely entertaining, a real page turner, which is a good thing considering its length!
B00013RC66|4.0|Not a great film, but a fascinating and quite wonderful one.  Many of the other reviewers tell almost the whole story, stopping short only just in time to avoid giving away the ending, but few of them mention the extraordinary sexual tension between Winger and Russell, each beautiful in her own way.  Apparently not quite clear to several of the reviewers here is the fact that Winger's character is quite sure almost from the time she stumbles across accounts of several suspicious deaths that Russell's character is the killer.  It's not about finding it out at all -- it's about proving it.  When the two finally meet they are drawn to one another in spite of the suspicions each has about the other. Their supposed friendship is a device that each tries to work to her advantage, but the erotic pull between them as they play cat and mouse is real and can only be called delicious.  The minor roles are well played, especially by Nicol Williamson and the mannered, strange Dennis Hopper and Lois Smith.  If there is a weak link here, it is Samy Frey, who speaks his lines as if he learned them phonetically and wishes he were back in Paris.  Beautiful as the Hawaiian scenery is, the brief time spent near Seattle is just as beautiful. \\"Black Widow\\" is a movie that can be enjoyed many times.
B0058OUJA4|4.0|I hate the idea of a game copying another developer&apos;s game as much as the next person. That being said; this game, AND hexdefense are both clones of geo defense for iphone. Honestly zdefense looks a little closer to the original iphone version to me anyway. I still think I prefer hexdefense, but it&apos;s just a matter of personal opinion. This is still a fun game. If you don&apos;t like tower defense games don&apos;t download it. Quit bitching about something that&apos;s free people.
0684135051|1.0|I'm an intermediate knitter who has heard about how great EZ is. Well this book was very lame. It taught me nothing and the patterns are hideous. People say her tone is entertaining, if that were true then this book wouldn't have been a total waste of money. I would hope a beginning knitter would not buy this book because they will then consider giving up the hobby. There are many other books out there that are better at teaching knitting and are more entertaining with much more attractive patterns.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|Okay, let's be real. I'm a little confused as to why this book has a higher rating than The Maze Runner. I really enjoyed reading this book, but it did not compare to the magic of the original. I guess my expectations were extremely high going into reading The Scorch Trials.The reason? The first book was extremely original and was unlike anything I had ever read, plus it was so suspenseful and to be truthfully honest, I was terrified while reading it. Those grievers were friggin scary!<br /><br />That being said, I really enjoyed The Scorch Trials, and had it been a stand-alone novel, it would have been absolutely amazing. This is the reason I still gave it four stars, because it was an awesome read by itself. It still had the suspense and the fantastic world-building that the first book had. I did really miss the maze though. There was this feeling of claustrophobia in The Maze Runner that really helped the reader feel trapped in the story.<br /><br />I really loved the section of the story that took place in the city, which based on descriptions, I assumed was Las Vegas. If it wasn't, well then that's how I pictured it anyway. The cranks were really scary and the scenes that took place in the tunnels were riveting. I also really enjoyed the scenes in the beginning that took place in the safe house. After a few days, they still remain very memorable to me.<br /><br />I spent the whole book wondering what the heck was going on between Thomas and Teresa, and still received no answers, just more questions. That's okay though, because I'm pretty sure they will all be answered in The Death Cure, which thankfully comes out in October. I really need to know how this series ends.<br /><br />The one thing I have to complain about, as always, is the lack of character development. This still really bothers me, because I wish I was more emotionally invested in the characters. That way, when something bad happens to them I would care more. It's the end of the second book in the series, and I still have really no idea who Thomas is as a person. He's just a name with a face. The books would be a lot more disturbing if the characters felt a little more real.<br /><br />The Gladers language that I hated in the first book was here in the second book, but for some reason didn't bother me as much. I'm not sure if it's because I got used to it or because it was used in a less awkward way. Either way, it annoyed me a lot less this time around.<br /><br />The Scorch Trials really impressed me, and as a follow-up book to The Maze Runner, I think it was a great effort, but as usual it fell victim to sequel disease. It was good, not great. And I can't help but feel a little bit disappointed. Still, it is really worth reading. The suspense is worth it alone.ally no idea who Thomas is as a person.

B0058OUJA4|1.0|To be fair, I did not download this game.  When I saw the screenshots, I noticed some amazing similarities to one of the best defense games I&apos;ve played, Hex Defense.  Most Amazon customers that take advantage of the &quot;free app of the day&quot; should also notice this because Hex Defense was free on 4/30.  A lot of games are similar in play, but offer different graphics or a twist to make them different.  The graphics of this game are the exact same, less another tower option. Unacceptable.  Where&apos;s the creativity?

B004VD3PE0|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I haven't experienced a loss even remotely close to what happens in this book. It was honestly hard for me to relate to that. In addition, I am not an overly emotional person, especially when watching a movie or reading a book (since I know its not real and always have a skeptical view of things that happen). I want a book to entertain me. Whether that is to make me laugh, or excited with its action or make me cry because it is so sad (which there is so very few that make this list.) This book does none of those things except in the very beginning.<br /><br />Synopsis: As Mia lies in between life and death, she has an out of body experience that enables her to see how people are reacting and listen to what they are saying to her. She has a difficult choice to make. She must go back and examine her past and decide if she wants to have a future.<br /><br />Have you ever thought about what you would choose?<br /><br />I liked the conjunction of music and family in the book. These two things are most important in Mia's life. As she recalls past events, both aspects take center stage in her tales. I thought the relationship with Adam was a bit pedantic and undeveloped. As I feel with most YA books, the romance aspect was thrown in just because. The author assumed Mia had to have a boyfriend because there had to be someone close to her at her side. I really got no sense of Adam as a person.<br /><br />It's a solid edition to the YA genre but not a real favorite of mine.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|Like so many reviewers I've been a fan going on 40 years and own the entire catalog.  However, I'm basing my review on my reaction to the new Yes CD Fly From Here, nothing else.  How I feel about Drama, Jon Anderson, etc., doesn't strike me as relevant.<br /><br />Fly From Here is a very pleasant, enjoyable CD which I'll no doubt listen to a bunch of times over the next several weeks then will get filed into my CD collection.  The musicianship is superb as you'd expect from Steve Howe, Chris Squire, Alan White and Geoff Downes.  Downes' keyboards emphasis is on making pleasant, interesting sounds as opposed to demonstrating his virtuosity.<br /><br />Musically, it's pretty soft, no edginess.  There are interesting themes but a lacking of interesting melodies.  The instrumentation is quite dated - this sounds like a album that could have easily been made in the 70's.  The production is clear as a bell.  You can hear everything and it all sounds great, a definite plus for me.<br /><br />New singer Benoit David has a pleasant and pleasing, if somewhat generic voice.  I find some of his pronounciation (\\"zeeroah?\\" and e-n-u-n-c-i-a-t-i-o-n (beginning of Fly From Here Part 3) to be jarring and suspect the Trevor Horn influence.  Backup vocals are superb throughout.<br /><br />My favorite cut is Riding a Tiger, for some mysterious reason called \\"Life on a Film Set\\" on the CD.  I particularly like the strong contrasts within the song, although I understand the chorus drives other people nuts.  I'm afraid I'm not too keen on Chris's The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be or Steve's Hour of Need.  Both needed a lot more effort on the lyrics and might have been better-placed on solo albums.  The entire Fly From Here Suite, Steve's acoustic guitar solo Solitaire and the concluding ensemble piece Into the Storm are all plus songs for me.

030746363X|5.0|For months the scales wouldn't budge no matter how well my diet and exercise were.  I saw Tim Ferriss on Dr. Oz and thought I'd get the book to learn more about his strategies for fat loss.  Now the scales are moving (and in the right direction) again!  I've only used a handful of his tips, and the small changes work.  Changing up breakfast and my exercise routine were easy.  The cold showers, well, that's taken some getting use to, but they definitely work.  I recommend this book if your fat loss efforts are stuck in a rut.

1250004349|2.0|The author felt that she needed to weave in a contemporary twist in order to make this story appealing/marketable.  Hog wosh !  First I saw the movie version where the book was given out free.  So I read the book afterwards to see if I was equally disappointed, as with the movie.  For such a powerful compelling story of Sarah, I felt cheated out of hearing more directly from Sarah's voice.  The constant back and forth between the past and the present was very annoying and totally unnecessary.  In fact, it really detracted from the story about Sarah and the key.  I found myself skipping the chapters where the journalist kept whining about her French husband and the pregnancy and the apartment, on and on.    The story could have stood alone and be much more powerful if it was narrated entirely by Sarah.  Tatiana de Rosnay's writing was fine.  I just did not like the flow of the story.  It was very schizophrenic jumping back and forth too much.  Then the last half seemed to be all about Julia Jarmond the journalist and her issues which overshadowed the integrity of Sarah's story.  The most disappointing part was the very end - how she met Bertrand Tezac in NY and they both just happened to be divorced and spent endless hours in the restaurant.  What the heck does that have to do with Sarah ?  It just took away from the compelling story of Sarah's life.  She was trying to put a Hollywood love story thing in there (surfing the web for Bertrand for two years) and it was too fragmented and distracting.   Sarah deserved more space and time.

0316056863|3.0|Anyone who has ever watched an episode of 30 Rock, knows that Tina Fey is a very gifted comedy writer. However, her magic with words is not a constant in her book. First of all, this is not really a complete biography, but carefully chosen excerpts of different stages of her life. There were many times that I wished she would elaborate more on a subject. Second of all, with all the hype and her infamous wit, I expected to find more than just rants about feminism. Don't get me wrong, there are great parts in the book, especially when it comes to Tina Fey impersonating Sarah Palin. But overall, it left me wanting more. In the end, it wasn't so bossy after all.

The story contained some very interesting characters with some unexpected twists.  Although not a keep your lights on while you read horror book it was suspenseful and made it difficult to put the book down.  As the saying goes it was a real page turner.  I would and will definitely recommend this book to friends.
B00007ELEL|1.0|A friend of mine recently bought this DVD.  He assured me I would like it.  I had my doubts from reading the DVD jacket but said okay.  Curious, as I'd explained to him numerous times what sorts of films or themes I like, and don't.  And every I \\"don't\\" is amazingly encapsuled in this--uh--film--if one can call it that.<br /><br />So we watched the DVD.  I gave it about twenty minutes--to be polite--though after about three of them I knew I hadn't the slightest idea in the world what the hell this--thing--was about.  Here's a bunch of guys who they seem to think are 'with it' I suppose.  The dialogue is essentially one raunchy joke followed by another cheesy joke, with a \\"f\\" bomb about every four seconds.  The twenty minutes seemed like 20,000 years in Sing Sing, as the book goes.<br /><br />Apparently most people love this movie.  I'd like to see a breakdown of the demographics.

1401200923|5.0|This is a review for both \\"Hush\\" vol.1 and vol.2<br /><br />Jeph Loeb and Jim Lee have done what only masters of the craft of Batman-storytelling have been able to do; and that is to spotlight all of the elements that make \\"Batman\\" such a cool title. Within this epic series, you find lots of Batman in action, Batman using his detective skills, a smorgasboard of a  rogues gallery, and a dark, thrilling plot full of twists and turns that makes for one fun-filled romp through the Batman universe.<br /><br />There is really no way to elborate on the spectacularness that is this story. Batman isn't a newbie here(such as in \\"Batman: Year One\\"). Nor is he an older, more hardened vigilante(such as in \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\"). Both of those are phenomenal graphic novels and are worthy of 5 stars. But here, we get to see a Batman in his prime. He's at the top of his game in every way. We also get a nice interjection of supporting characters, such as Nightwing, Catwoman, and Jim Gordon(there are many more than this, but for expediency, I just named a few). We get to hear Batman's thoughts as he pieces the story together, as well as feel his emotions - something Loeb has shown an excellent ability to do in his other Batman-related stories(see \\"Superman/Batman: Public Enemies\\"). The story provides a nice depth to it, in part due to its long length. The length never makes things feel drawn-out; instead, it only adds to the gripping and thoughtful plot. The dialogue is also well-written, leaving you hanging on every word. Loeb is a masterful superhero writer. And it clearly shows in these books.<br /><br />What can I say about Jim Lee? The guy is another industry icon. His artwork is legendary for being both highly(and I mean HIGHLY!) detailed and realistic, while not being so photo-realistic as to not leave behind his very own stylish fingerprints as well. His work here is truly astonishing. But this is the case with all of his works. So there's nothing new to report here in terms of the quality of art. If you're a fan of Lee's, as I am, you will not only not be disappointed, but you will find yourself asking the question, \\"How does this guy continue to top himself, churning out more and more amazing art with every panel I see?\\". For those of you who are unfamiliar with Lee(and I doubt there are many of you), take my word for it: the guy's a god. Add to this the inking and colors and lettering, and you have one of the most beautifully illustrated Batman graphic novels ever put to paper.<br /><br />This is how Batman should be done. It's energetic, it's dark, it's action-packed, full of mystery and suspense, and it's a blast to read. Buy both volumes or the book that contains both volumes together. Or preferably, if you have the money, the \\"Absolute\\" edition. Any way you go, you can't lose. This is a winner, plain and simple.t.

B003QP4NPE|1.0|I ordered this book based on glowing reviews by Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte on their Security Now Podcast.  To say I am disappointed is an understatement.  The books reads like a writing assignment by college freshman in computer science.     A synopsis would be blah blah blah, tcp stack, blah, blah, blah, 256 bit encryption, blah, blah, blah jaded cop who has seen it all, blah, blah blah, super smart scientist, blah blah blah, denial of service blah, blah, blah, set up for second book.    This is a real pity. The underlying concept is interesting but it is executed in such a juvenile manner as to be really irritating. Surely someone can write technological thrillers in a more intelligent way. I give it -3 stars and advise prospective readers to not waste their money.      If this is what passes for good science fiction these days I am going back to the masters (Clark, Heinlein, Asimov, Herbert) who had interesting stories to tell and could actually write them.
B0051T46XM|2.0|I typically like this type of movie and I had heard good reviews of this one. I was not impressed. In fact, the only thing I liked about this movie was the scenery. The rest was, in my opinion, poorly written.  The dialogue was just plain dumb at times, feeling very unnatural. I wanted to like it more.
0307477479|1.0|This novel is about the author - not the characters - and it has \\"Look at ME\\" all over it.  This author is in love with her cuteness, her contrivances, her forced quirkiness, her knowledge of punk music minutia, her picking at the scabs of dysfunctional behavior.  Her unquestioned potential is wasted on a disjointed style that results in quite a depressing read.  The characters are determinedly narcissistic because the author is. At the end, Bennie says: \\"You grew up, Alex, just like the rest of us.\\"  Nothing could be further from the truth.    Just because the author has a quote referring to Proustian theory does not give her a pass to simply meander through characters' lives in the name of pushing literary boundaries.  Writing in a fragmented style seldom elevates a literary work's value.  That is so true here.    Rather than follow a universal muse, she is fully in control asking us to admire HER - and her stuck, tawdry characters.  I believe 'real' people have an underlying drive to make some sense of this \\"one precious life\\" against the background of eternity  - but you wont find much hint of that here.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|I love this show and pretty much everything about it, but I'm kind of growing annoyed with how much of an ignorant whore Dexter's sister is.  It doesn't matter if the person is old and dying or a huge conflict of interest, she'll sleep with anything and say anything no matter how ignorant.  And no police department would let her conflict of interest business fly on any level (unless it's LA or Detroit).  It's kind of stupid to the level of annoyance.  I know it's simply bad writing, but she's the only part of the show that continues to annoy me.  So if you don't mind a part with a stupid girl (with mediocre acting) that looks good, then this will be a 5 star show for you.

B000M4PPM2|5.0|This is an album for those who appreciate lyrics that require thought and interpretation blended with great music. \\"Tell All The People\\" and \\"Do It\\" speak of the events happening at the time this album was released. \\"Touch Me\\" and \\"Wild Child\\" contain Jim Morrison's signature sexiness. \\"Shaman's Blues\\" is a great, catchy song as well. The title track \\"The Soft Parade\\" is long, containing different styles of music, and lyrics that are satirical towards society. \\"The Soft Parade\\" is showing how some mindlessly follow, religion or society in general. Listen to the quote at the beginning \\"When I was back in seminary school..\\" and once Jim starts singing \\"Can you give me sanctuary? I must find a place to hide\\".   I would recommend this to anyone who is capable thinking about the music they are listening to. And not just mindlessly joining a soft parade of listening to meaningless music.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|After first seeing these in a store, I immediately wanted them, but was hesitant to pay so much for cooking utensils. Amazon definitely had the best price I could find and when they arrived, I was happy I took the plunge. I use these for everything and have rarely had to use a utensil outside of the set, save for the wooden spoon and whisk here and there.<br /><br />The elevation feature is definitely nice for those dishes that don't really dirty your utensil much, but when making a sauce, even a little bit left on the end will make the utensil succumb to gravity. All you have to do is make sure you tap the excess off into the pot and you're all set. It's not as big a deal as some reviewers make it out to be. You can definitely count on not needing a spoon rest!<br /><br />They're easy to clean, easy to use and get compliments every time someone new sees them. They're a great set and I highly recommend them!
B00514HDNW|4.0|This is an enjoyable novella and very reasonably priced. I liked in particular that you're given one man to follow through his experience with \\"vampires\\". That decision helps to create a wealth of questions in the reader's mind and also build an appropriate sense of dread.<br /><br />I'm glad I saw the movie before reading the book, because if it had been in reverse I would have been disappointed by how Hollywood switched a lot of Matheson's stuff around.<br /><br />If you're looking for other novella's with a similar feel to them, try Stephen King's UR and Ralph Lagana's The Monkey's Paw Trilogy.
B0058A11AK|5.0|Barbra Streisand is one of the most successful entertainers of our time. She has won 2 Academy Awards, 8 Grammy Awards, 4 Emmy Awards, a Special Tony Award, an American Film Institute Award and a Peabody Award. Also, she is the best selling female artist on the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) list and the only female in the top 10. Plus has had 31 albums reach Billboard's top ten. She is also the only artist to ever achieve number 1 albums in 5 different decades. Quite impressive, and now she is back with the follow up to 2009's \\"Love is the Answer.\\" \\"What Matter's Most\\" is Streisand's 33rd studio album and she hasn't missed a beat! This two disc set is a collection of songs by Alan and Marilyn Bergman (whom she won Academy Awards with for \\"Yentl\\" and \\"The Way We Were\\"). Produced by Streisand herself, disc 1 contains Bergman songs she has never before recorded. Disc 2 (on the Deluxe Edition only) is a set of previously recorded songs. Included with a colorful 24 page booklet, Streisand proves yet again she is an extremely talented singer.     \\"Windmills Of My Mind\\" (from 1968's \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\") is the opening track and Streisand sounds beautiful, elegant, and as smooth as honey. She hits every note perfectly and shows the dynamic range that made her famous. Another highlight is \\"Nice n Easy,\\" a song made classic by Frank Sinatra in which she sounds absolutely splendid. Sinatra sang it as a song about falling in love. Streisand's version is a song of seduction; of making love from a woman's point of view. \\"Alone in the World\\" is a love song, and this is what she does best. Sounding pure, vibrant yet subtle, the sound is simply amazing. A trumpet solo by Chris Botti adds texture and contributes wonderfully to the sound. \\"So Many Stars\\" was originally a hit song by Sergio Mendes and Brazil 66. Streisand adds her own personal touches to this song and can still hit the high notes even at age 69. Featuring an awesome Brazilian beat, she sings Bergman's lyrics in Portuguese. For those of you keeping track, that now makes a total of 8 languages that she has sung in! \\"What Matters Most\\" is the closing track, and leaves you wanting more. From the Jon Voight film \\"The Champ,\\" the lyrics are beautiful, almost as if they were written with Streisand's voice in mind. Streisand is the rare singer who can touch your soul as you listen, and these amazing songs will linger long after you shut off your music player. Highly recommended!!!!
030788743X|5.0|When I go back and watch a Spielberg film from the late 70s or early 80s, it has a certain look and feel to it - a tone that is instantly recognizable.  When I watch a sitcom from the 80s, it has a singular cadence that instantly puts me at ease, and prepares me to have my problems solved in 30 minutes or less.  When I play a video game from the late 70s or early 80s, it makes my fingers itch for a quarter.  And, when I read one of the books I loved when I was a teenager, it brings back the pure joy I would find in losing myself in another time and another place.  I spend so much time thinking about what I read now; it's becoming more and more rare for me to find that unadulterated escape in a book anymore.  I found it when I read \\"Ready Player One\\" - and I loved it.      This is a book for anyone who's every memorized a pattern on Pac-Man.  It's a book for anyone who's ever answered a question by saying - \\"Blue...no, yellow!\\" It's a book for anyone who's ever rolled multi-sided dice in the hopes of achieving greatness. It's a book for anyone who's ever believed with all his or her heart that a small square on a small TV, holding a pixilated arrow, was really a brave knight on an epic Adventure.       This book is just fun.  I don't want to go in to great detail on the story itself - to do that would ruin the thrill of discovery I felt as I turned each page.  It drew me in from the first chapter and whisked me along on a trip down memory lane.  So much of my childhood is represented in this book; it felt like putting on a comfortable pair of old blue jeans.  I realized about half way through that this is the book my 13 year-old self didn't know he was preparing my 40 year-old self to love.      To stop there, though, would do the story a disservice.  It's not merely a 300+ page excuse to reminisce about the stories, games, and movies of our youth.  It's also a compelling story that invests you in its characters.  There are themes exploring the corporatization of ourculture, the true meaning of friendship, and the dangers of disconnecting yourself from the real world.  The last is a timely message, and deftly balanced between a love for the virtual world and an understanding of the need for balance between the virtual and the physical.    Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of \\"Ready Player One\\".  Whether you are a fan of 80s pop culture or not - whether you've ever even put a quarter in to a Ms. Pac-Man machine - this is a book that will entertain you.  You will not be disappointed.  It has action, it has adventure - but it also has heart, and ultimately a message about the importance of not losing sight of what's real.  It gave me a span of 3 days where I felt like I was 13 again and nothing in the world mattered as much as answering the question - \\"what happens next?\\"  It may only be August, but I feel certain I've just read my favorite book of 2011.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|I watched this after finally giving into the back-in-forth of whether or not I should. It was better than I thought. I think Gyllenhaal & Hathaway work really well together. I even teared up a few times.<br /><br />I had to giggle though through the entire beginning scene, where Jamie is working in an electronics store in 1996 selling his little heart out to potential customers. It totally reminded me of my college days working at Circuit City. In 96' I was a CSA( customer service) but most of my co-workers were friends who were sales associates trying to make money off commissions so they all had their hardsell speeches. It took me back and anyone that has ever worked in an electronics store will understand.<br />~
0312370849|5.0|Have about 30 pages left to read and it is wonderful...hard to put down!  I understand the movie is very good.
044042335X|2.0|I enjoyed this.  It was suspenseful and rewarding, but so many things were extremely silly and childish, that I don't recommend it.<br /><br />For example, at one point some hostages send the protagonist (Reacher) a message that they were in the 53rd and 131st army divisions.  He notes that 53 is a prime number, and adds the digits together, and concludes that there are 8 hostiles.  From \\"131\\" he takes it that the hostage is telling him that he should combine the 13th letter of the alphabet (M) and the first (A), telling him that a man named \\"Mauny\\" is present.  Note that he could have just as well concluded that 131 is a prime, and the sum of the digits is 5, so there are 5 hostiles.<br /><br />If silly junk like that doesn't bother you, you will enjoy this book.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I never watched the re-make of Battlestar Galactica when it aired. I watched the original 1978 series for a while until it got too silly and then gave up on it. Robot dogs, kids and everyone had names of the gods, it got too Lost in Space like for me.    BBC America started running the new Battlestar Galctica series and I had nothing better to do so I figured I would check it out. Within an hour of the two hour opener I was hooked. The characters were good, the acting was good, nice special effects and the gods name were just call signs. Anyway, after a couple of weeks watching on BBC America I decided I couldn't wait a week between episodes and purchased the series from Amazon on Blue-ray. Now I find it hard to limit myself to one episode a night as I work my way through the series.    The Blueray discs have all sorts of nice extra features, commentaries, video blogs, games and other internet related stuff I haven't figured out yet, but the series was shot to look like a documentary, so the video is a little grainy at times with wobbly cameras to give you the feeling you are there so don't look for exceptional video quality. Do look for good action, good writing and characters acting like real people. This is not a Star Trek like universe where it is 'All for one and one for all' type of mentality. The characters cheat, lie, go on strike, try to save their own rear ends at the expense of others, somtimes to the point that I miss the Star Trek type attitude.    Can't say enough about the actors. Everyone is good in their role. I like Mary McDonnell as the president. She has this smile when dealing with other characters that makes her look like she knows more than they do and no matter what she'll get her way, kinda like a real politicians attitude. I also like the kind of retro feel to the overall design of the series. The ships look  like they have been heavily used. Nothing is too high tech. The CGI cylons are great, no actor in a costume here. There are plot holes that sometimes make me think, what are they doing, but it is a TV show and they have to create drama somehow.    My major complaint about this disc set is they have extended versions of some of the episodes but they don't really alert you to this unless you read the back of each box. It is annoying to watch an episode and then find that the next one is the same one you just watched with 16 minutes of additional footage. The episodes to watch out for are,    Season Two-- Pegasus  Season Three-- Unfinished Business  Season Four-- Battlestar Galactica Razor                A disquiet follows my souls                Islanded in a stream of stars                Daybreak    Bottom line, If you're a fan of the show you'll love seeing it again and with all of the added goodies it will be just that much more fun. If you're new too the series, you're gonna have a real good time watching this well executed show, just try not to watch all four seasons in one night.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|It could have been about eight hundred pages less than it is.  There is good stuff if you can wade thru all of the knights and their genealogy.
B002WYH5N2|3.0|I rate the movie 5 stars.  It is true the movie doesn't follow the book completely but does any movie?  There are very few things that are different in the movie from the book.  I just found there were many story lines that were left out completely.  This movie focuses more on Mr. Dacy and Lizzie's relationship.  I loved the movie. Three stars rating is due to the two disc collector's edition.  It is a waste of money.  It is two copies of the movie. I don't need two of the same movie.  The extras aren't worth the cost.  I wouldn't buy this two disc collector's edition. Buy a single video.
030788743X|5.0|Amazing read. After the first few pages I was hooked and couldn't put it down. It uses a lot of 80's references but even though I was born in 1987 I was still able to understand the majority of them. Throughout the book I found myself getting goose bumps and excited as the story went along. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure novels, lived in the 80's, or any gamer.
B002RD4UZ4|5.0|Can't begin to say enough about this CD, Melody Gardot's voice.  I could listen all day, every day.  So grateful to have stumbled onto her since where I live, hearing new music, new artists, or even good old ones in the genre's I like is difficult.  Her styling is extraordinary, refreshing.  Her blend of so many music \\"categories\\" into her own unique style is impressive.  Creativity is such magic and this woman has magic oozing out of her fingers and vocal chords.  It is pure jazz for me even though she doesn't call it that.  My kind of rhythm, joy, delight.  I just hope she keeps coming with more like this.  But if not, I can savour this one forever!!  Best new artist I've heard in years with no equals.

0312330537|5.0|Shantaram, surprised me! It was given to me and the novel was so big that I wasn't sure that I wanted to tackle it.<br />As I got into Shantaram, I started to enjoy it. The protaganist adventures and incidents are so well written and real.<br />Sometimes, I would stop reading and just contemplate on, the beauty of, the way a paragraph was written. I enjoyed it immensely
B0051T47NQ|4.0|Mockumentaries seem to have worn out their welcome just as much as unnecessary remakes have in recent years. There have been countless fake documentaries out there that chronicle \\"real\\" events or try to come off as feeling more authentic by using this technique. The Blair Witch Project, REC, Borat, The Poughkeepsie Tapes, Cloverfield, Diary of the Dead, Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, I'm Still Here, and Paranormal Activity are just a few examples that come to mind. It's become a really monotonous concept as of late since all of the films that decide to go this route all seem to follow the same formula. Trollhunter is a bit different though. It at least feels like its pushing the boundaries of what mockumentaries are truly capable of.<br /><br />Three college students are sent to investigate some rather unorthodox bear killings, but eventually come to realize they've bitten off more than they can chew. Their investigation leads them to Hans (Otto Jespersen), who is believed to be a poacher trying to capitalize on the success of all the bear hunters in Norway. The students are adamant about getting an interview with Hans and follow the mysterious man as he comes and goes at odd hours of the day and stays out all night. While trailing him one night, Thomas (Glenn Erland Tosterud); one of the students, is bitten by something as we finally get a glimpse of what Hans really hunts; trolls. Hans eventually caves and allows the students to tag along with him as he shows us a world the government is going to elaborate lengths to cover up.<br /><br />Trollhunter has gone to great lengths to at least appear like a lot of thought went into how these trolls exist in the real world. Whether a lot of time went into that or not, the parts of the film where that information is given to us is easily the most intriguing aspect of the film. Everything from how UV rays affect them, whether they'll explode or turn to stone, the various different types of trolls, why some have multiple heads, and what power lines are really put up for are all things touched upon in the film. It is probably a bit unrealistic on one hand, but if you grew up reading Grimm's Fairy Tales or are a fan of fantasy in general, then it's something you'll easily find yourself getting absorbed into.<br /><br />While the film does a good job of latching onto your interest, Trollhunter does kind of feel like it rushes in the troll department a bit. We see several different types of trolls; a Tosserlad, Ringlefinch, Mountain Kings, and the Jotnar. But you're left wanting more of these adventures of close encounters with these enormous fantastical creatures, which is probably better than wanting less of them. Everything we see relating to the trolls is incredible, but it seems like none of those scenes last anywhere near as long as anything building up to them. At one point in the film, Thomas mentions something about them currently standing where many troll battles take place. Mountain trolls and woodland trolls apparently come to blows there, throw rocks at each other, and basically just have an all out war. That would've been amazing to actually see.<br /><br />With that said, the troll scenes are still very impressive. The real gems are the Tosserlad and the Jotnar since they are the ones with the most screen time. The night vision camera along with the chase in the woods and how Hans subdues the creature are what make the Tosserlad experience so exciting. The Jotnar is almost overwhelming due to its size and it manages to deliver some of the most astounding scenes in the film. The main one being Hans trying to get in front of the Jotnar by driving right underneath its feet while it's walking only to be struck by its massive right hand. That scene makes the whole mockumentary technique payoff.<br /><br />Trollhunter is not meant to be terrifying and it more than likely won't make you cry from laughing too hard. It is, however, a thought provoking and fascinating dark fantasy film. Whether the appearance of the trolls appeals to you or not is entirely up to you, but they are presented fairly realistically on film. The amount of detail that goes into what they eat, how they act, and why they're being hunted is what keeps you intrigued in-between the brief, although rather spectacular, altercations between the human characters and the trolls. Trollhunter puts a unique spin on what was otherwise thought to be a worn out concept and leaves you wanting more by the time it's all over, which is all any film should really aspire to do.<br /><br />Special features on the DVD are a bit misleading. Mostly because it looks like there's a ton, but most of them fall in between being only thirty seconds to three minutes in length. There are five Deleted Scenes that last about three and a half minutes total and aren't really all that important or interesting. Improv and Bloopers is two minutes in length and has three scenes. Extended Scenes is where it starts to get interesting. Nearly eight minutes in length, three scenes from the film are a bit longer and contain some fascinating tidbits here and there. Visual Effects is really cool. Three featurettes show how most of the trolls and other CG animated creatures (sheep, Hans in his sample extracting suit) are built from the ground up. This is all about six minutes in length. Behind the Scenes is probably the most vital special feature to watch. You get a good look at how much of the film was computer generated and how much was actually built on set. It's incredible how actors are able to react to things that aren't physically there with them to this extent. Behind the Scenes is spread out amongst seven featurettes and is about twenty three minutes long. Photo Galleries is mostly a look at troll sketches and they're habitats while HDNet: A Look at Trollhunter is mainly the cast talking about the film in between clips of the film itself. These features are around six minutes and four minutes respectively. So you get a total of about fifty three minutes of bonus features.<br /><br />Trollhunter is rated PG-13 for some sequences of creature terror, is available in both English and Norwegian 5.1 Dolby Digital with English or Spanish subtitles, and presented in a widescreen 1.78:1 aspect ratio. It is approximately 103 minutes long. Trollhunter was released today on both DVD and Blu-ray in both retail stores and most online retailers.of the trolls appeals to you or not is entirely up to you, but they are presented fairly realistically on film.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but after about a week of using it, it became clear how amazing this keyboard is. It works really well. It is very intuitive and I type much more quickly than with other keyboards.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I wasn't too impressed with John Powell's music (apart from Bourne) until I heard this album. It has 25 tracks, but is not repetitive; epic, but not overwhelming! The Jonsi track, being the only one with lyrics, impressed me as well. The album features original themes with great viking-like style, catching you up into the adventure with pure excitement. It is astounding, and I love it!!

0756659841|5.0|Let me start off by saying: \\"There are a LOT of stickers in this book!\\"  Seriously, my kids have put the stickers in all the proper places withing the book, covered up their Lego bins with stickers, and put stickers on their walls and there are still a ton of stickers left over!<br />The book isn't heavy reading material, although there is a brief description of each Lego theme on the pages where the stickers go, but then again I don't think that this book was really intended as a reading book!<br />The stickers are what it's all about!<br />The book is really a lot of fun and my kids (4 year old boy and a 5 year old girl)and I sat down for days and filled up each little theme with the proper stickers so there was really a lot of interaction value from this book.  The stickers do tear a little easily, so you need to be careful, but they stick well so you don't have to worry about them peeling off on their own.<br />Great fun and the whole family can enjoy this book!
B000Q67876|5.0|I first saw this movie when it was released in 1994.  I could  not wait until this  movie was released on DVD and bought  it immediately.  When it was released on  Blu Ray I bought it immediately.  The difference between the DVD and Blu Ray is great!  Some scenes  that  look the best are when Morgan Freeman in in the  hay field in Buxton.  The colours are incredible.   The close ups of Red and  Andy are crystal clear and every great character  mark you can see.  If you are not sure if you want to upgrade, let me just say it is well  worth it.  I have  watched this movie many times, and again tonight.  This movie just gets better and better with each viewing.  The bonus features on the blu ray are a carry over from the  two disc DVD but great to have.  I  could go on and on about this movie, and to those that say they do not understand why this movie is so well  loved, well, sorry, you must not be fortunate to appreciate such a masterpiece.  If you have never seen this movie, you are in for a real  treat. So nice to see that you DO NOT NEED 3D, car crashers, monsters, rock sound track, all the trapping of so many crappy movies that are around  today.  Well, put in the blu ray, sit back and enjoy......
0553801473|3.0|My dear departed brother told me of reading Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. He stated that the series started out with great promise but eventually the later books did nothing to advance the plotline and seemed to be written with the sole purpose of extending the story ad infinitum. Unfortunately, the same thing appears to be happening with George Martin's series. I greatly enjoyed the first couple of books and thankfully did not have to wait six years for volume 5, having been enticed to read the series after watching HBO's adaptation of the first book. It now seems that Martin has realized that this series is a cash cow and he has no intention of ending it any time soon, hence we have a one thousand page book with barely any plot movement. The Others, so ominously hovering in the beginning, have become almost an afterthought. Were it not for the constant and neverending descriptions of food and clothing everpresent in all the books, the length of these thousand page behemoths could have been cut in half. I am slogging my way through Dance With Dragons and the wonder of the early story has significantly worn off. Apparently Martin has decided that this will be the work of his remaining years and intends to squeeze every last dollar from it along with whatever waning interest we readers can still muster. A well written but extreme disappointment.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Although my family and I have been Josh Groban fans for several years, I wasn't aware this CD had come out until my dad bought it last December while we were Christmas shopping. It was, indeed, a great surprise! Eight months later, I still love listening to it just as much as the first day we played it.    I love all the songs on this album, but I admit I have my favorites. \\"The Wandering Kind\\" is the first instrumental Josh Groban song I have ever heard. My only complaint about it is that it ends too soon! It became an instant favorite...even for my 2-year-old brother, who, when we first got the CD, would insist on hearing it three times before we could hear the rest of the songs. Other favorites of mine include \\"Hidden Away\\", \\"Higher Window,\\" \\"If I Walk Away\\", \\"Love Only Knows\\", and \\"Voce Existe Em Mim\\".     If you're thinking about buying \\"Illuminations\\", don't hesitate for a moment! This album merits 5 starts all the way. LOVE IT!
0307266303|5.0|I've always hated to run.  It was never an internal thing with me but rather running was an external thing with which I had to struggle against.  This book opened my eyes to a new approach and slowly but surely, yep, I'm realizing I was Born to Run.  It's becoming fun for me and I have this book to thank for that.  If running has intrigued you but you've never been a fan of running (but secretly wanted to be) this book could be what you're looking for.

1596680296|5.0|As someone who owns several books on sock knitting, and has checked lots more out from the library, I would fully endorse this as the best sock book available.  It has a pattern for each yarn weight, from fingering to bulky.  This is it's greatest feature, since not many other books provide this basic info.  It is great for beginners because it is simple; not bogged down with lots of different methods on how to do everything.  Once you have mastered the basics, it offers a few embellishments, like lace and cables.  If you're itching to take it a step further and already know what you're doing, I'd recommend \\"The Sock Knitter's Workshop\\" by Ewa Jostes, which has many different methods, including toe-up, circular needles, several heel types, cast-on methods, etc, but is hard to follow unless you're an expert.

0061537969|3.0|This book was heartfelt and nice to read, but that's about it.  The writing is unchallenging and amateur at best, which is ok if you're just looking for something to relax to.  The plot was often slow and I found it difficult to concentrate, especially considering that the author tells you how the book ends in the description, and that kind of ruined it for me.    I also thought it was really cheesy how Enzo could understand EVERYTHING Denny said.  Dogs are incredibly smart, don't get me wrong (smarter than I think we give them credit for), but seriously?  Dogs have to be trained to understand even basic commands, and if they could think like us, they'd be us (opposable thumbs notwithstanding, as Enzo likes to point out).    Overall, the book was sweet, and I easily related to Denny as a character, and it was fun to cuddle with my own dogs while reading.  The author made me truly feel for him, and I guess that is what writing is all about.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|You know, it's so crazy because i was on youtube looking for the song \\"die trying\\" by the art of dying, and accidentally clicked on the art of dying by gojira. i listened to maybe half the song but thought, this guys voice sounds way too heavy for me to enjoy becuase i couldnt really understand what he was saying, and i like some metal. The next day, i had the music entirely stuck in my head and i couldn't get rid of it, so i looked up that song again and tried muscling through the voice. Clicking on more of their stuff, i found i really enjoyed their music and tones and feeling of their music. I finally bought the album and holy crap, this is one of the best albums i have ever listened to. the music is heavy, yes, but you have got to listen to them numerous times. Their lyrics are simply brilliant! Its amazing how deep these lyrics can be while sounding so amazing. I recently bought the other 3 albums now, and i think the way of all flesh is still my favorite, but these guys have got to be my favorite band now! These guys music proves that music can be powerful and meaningful and sound great, front to back. All music artists everywhere, pay attention to greatness!
B001HN6922|5.0|Great movie! But there is some violence. I don't know how it got rated G. Should have been PG. Just make sure that whoever is watching it is at least 5 or 6.

0812973992|5.0|This book is remarkable. It's hard to write an original review of a National Book Award-winning book that has been critically lauded by the New York Times Book Review, Dave Eggers, and Frank McCourt, among others. What can I bring to the table, two years after its original release? So this is just my attempt to collect my thoughts.     First of all, I've never read a novel by Colum McCann before. I think he's a genius. He wrote a post-9/11 novel that is set in 1974. Amazing. So many of the lines in the novel, especially descriptions of the Twin Towers, resonate in a haunting way, even without heavy-handed foreshadowing. Instead, McCann reminds us what New York is, was, and can be in the face of beauty and tragedy.    The organization of the novel is a mosaic of characters, moving through vignettes that eventually all connect. (Strangely, the novel I started immediately after this one, The Imperfectionists, functions in almost the same way.) Book 1, Book 2, and Book 3 are each composed of three stories each, set in 1974, punctuated between books by descriptions of the tightrope walker Phillippe Petit. Book 4 is the only one set after 9/11, and this is the book in which all the characters' stories intertwine. Though the characters range from an Irish monk to Bronx prostitutes to an upper-east side WASP, none of them ring false. McCann brings raw honesty and authenticity to all his characters, and even women narrators read true (something rare in men's writing, in my opinion).     I unhesitatingly recommend this book to anyone.     Some notable quotes:    \\"I gave them all of the truth and none of the honesty.\\" (p. 303)    \\"Recklessness and freedom--how did they become a cocktail?\\" (p. 263)    \\"Even if people laughed at the notion of goodness, if they found it sentimental, or nostalgic, it didn't matter--it was none of those things, he said, and it had to be fought for.\\" (p. 145)

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It may be written for a younger population, but there's a \\"big brother\\" message throughout the series that many adults will appreciate.  I started reading this quick-moving, easy-to-read book, and couldn't wait to read more.  It took a while to convince my husband to begin the series because he thought it would be very teenager-y and not very well written.  Finally, he picked it up, and now our conversations are primarily about The Hunger Games!<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1575666286|4.0|I found this book to be an interesting read. I personally don't have cancer, but I am thinking of future situations, and would like to have as much knowledge as possible. I find that it always goes back to the Bible in the way you need to eat. All the books have the same answer, but in our society it is not appealing to eat fruits and vegetables and juice them unless we are dying.

0345472322|5.0|Love this book. It explains so much. I've lived in a fixed mindset for much of my life - avoid failure at all costs, don't take action if I suspect I'm going to fail, quit projects if I think they are going bad. So clearly the \\"fixed mindset\\" described in this book. With the fixed mindset, if I fail at something it means my character is deficient, I'm not good enough, I'm a failure and worthless. With the \\"growth mindset\\" that's nonsense. Life is ever evolving and every experience is a chance to grow and improve. Failures are just feedback and often energize the individual to try new methods and put in more effort.     The author goes into depth with these mindsets in various areas of life - relationships, business, bullying, shyness, parenting, teaching... With the \\"growth mindset\\"someone bullies you and you wonder what is going on in their lives that has them behave that way rather than taking it to heart and believing it proves you are worthless. With the \\"growth mindset\\" CEO's empower everyone in their company and share the credit when things go right rather than pitting people against each other, surrounding themselves with yes-men, believing they are better than the rest and refusing to look at any negative feedback. With the \\"growth mindset\\" you believe a marriage/relationship is ever evolving, changing, growing and you are continually seeing how you can make it better rather than believing that things should be perfect automatically if you are with the right person.    A terrific read that will alter your life if you have been stuck in the \\"fixed mindset\\". Imagine how we could alter the world by teaching the \\"growth mindset\\". Phenomenal.
0450602907|5.0|I've read this book twice and am glad to have this in my collection. I spend a lot of time perusing book stores for books I'm going to read and books I plan to read when I have nothing better to do. Snow Wolf is a top-rate action novel that should be made into a movie, so long as the producer follows the book. The historical significance of what happened to Josef Stalin is not lost, as is the madness behind this evil leader. The characters involved in the plot are authentic, as is the action. Glenn Meade has written a book that can be read time and again, and will leave the read satisfied each time.    David Lucero, author of THE SANDMAN
0811870987|5.0|This stunning coffee table book of high-speed, high-detail photographs of birds on stark white backgrounds illustrates photography at its most artistic.  Exotic birds are captured in flight, expressing their personalities, or displaying a single part of their anatomy -- a talon, for example, or an eye.  Because of their sharpness, each photograph invites a close look, even with a magnifying glass, to see the details of birds as you've probably never seen them before.  What's most startling about this collection of photographs is their composition on the blank page that draws the viewer's eye into the photographer's unique perspective.  Zuckerman's artistic vision is unlike any other photographer I've seen, and this originality gives this book much of its power.  Of course, the individual subjects, from a scarlet macaw to a green magpie to a King bird-of-paradise to a snowy owl to many others, lend personality to every page.  Because part of the art is in the white (or negative space, if you will) of each page, none contains text or page numbers; instead, there's a thumbnail index at the back to learn about the species represented in each photograph.<br /><br />This book makes the perfect gift for a bird lover or anyone who appreciates photographic art.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000AYEL6U|5.0|People say that movies never do the book justice.  I wouldn't know in this case.  I do know, however, I am hesitant to read the book in fear that it will not do the movie justice.  It is that good.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|If you can watch this movie and not feel pretty pissed off at the government for letting these crooks walk then you're a better person than me.  The film is incredibly well made, well researched and features interviews of players in this fiasco at the highest levels of business and government from around the world.  If you had any doubts that Goldman Sachs and their ilk have the government in their pockets just watch this movie, you'll think differently.  Not only has no one been held accountable for this disaster, most of the crooks who perpetrated this fraud walked away richer than ever with huge payouts and bonuses.
0553801473|2.0|I'm a big fan of the series but this installment feels like at least half of it could have ended up in the editors bin. Frustrating ramble back and forth across the Free cities. The sense of direction of the series has gone the way of Eddard Stack, dead.
B0058A119G|5.0|It is incredible that Barbra Streisand has managed to remain in such good voice after all these years. Her range is inevitably narrower than it once was, but the songs are well chosen. None of the new recordings expose any problems. The end result is an album of easy-listening love songs that some people will criticize for having insufficient variety. However, although I hadn't heard any of the recordings beforehand, I was expecting an album of that type and I'm very pleased with it. Of course, Barbra had already recorded enough Bergman songs to fill several albums, and ten of those earlier 51 songs are presented here as a bonus CD.  The booklet contains the lyrics to all the newly recorded songs, comments about the old songs and the new album, plus pictures of Barbra, Alan and Marilyn together at various times from 1971 (a decade or so after Barbra first met the Bergmans) to 2011.<br /><br />It seems that Alan and Marilyn Bergman never wrote the actual music, but worked with a variety of music composers. Here, Michel Legrand is the composer most featured, being credited with two songs among the new recordings and seven of the ten oldies, though not the two most famous on that CD.<br /><br />The new recordings include songs that, for the most part, Barbra could have recorded long before 2011 had she chosen to, The removable sticker on the front suggests that the highlights of this CD are That face, Nice `n' easy and  Solitary moon. Actually picking highlights is tough but I particularly like the first two tracks, these being The windmills of your mind (the most familiar song here) and Something new in my life (written in 1984 for Miki and Maude), which I don't remember hearing before. The next two tracks (Solitary moon, Nice `n' easy) are also excellent, so it is easy to understand why they were mentioned on the sticker. Nice `n' easy dates from 1960, so is among the earliest songs that Alan and Marilyn wrote the lyrics for. The album continues to maintain its high standard, although none of the other songs are familiar enough for me to say that I've definitely heard them elsewhere. So this may be a covers album, but only one song is ultra-familiar, and there is one other song (Nice `n' easy) that I have definitely heard before. For me, that makes it a perfect song selection. With excellent performances by Barbra and her musicians, I have no complaints.<br /><br />The bonus CD inevitably covers more familiar territory, not only because it contains two classic tracks that every adult must have heard at some time, but because I have some of the albums on which these tracks first appeared. Even so, some of the songs are not all that familiar. Outside of Barbra's original albums or the soundtracks for which some of them were recorded, you might not hear some of these songs. It is interesting that two of these songs (Papa can you hear me, A piece of sky) come from Yentl, which is a movie that I actually watched although I don't usually watch movies. Despite watching the movie, I never bought the soundtrack so I'm pleased to find these songs here. There's a lot of great music on this CD, which is definitely not a greatest hits package but is an interesting compilation in its own right. A comparison between  the music here and the music on the main CD reveals the difference in Barbra's voice these days, but as I said at the top, her voice is still plenty good enough just now.<br /><br />This collection, with or without the bonus CD, is a fitting tribute by Barbra to two of her songwriting friends, apparently celebrating fifty years of friendship on a personal level.  If Barbra were to retire from the music business now, this would be a great way to go out. Somehow, I think there is more yet to come.gh none of the other songs are familiar enough for me to say that I've definitely heard them elsewhere.

B003AO1SVS|4.0|It's a good CD, these guys rock.  I don't need to add more to the reviews however I wanted to point out that the CD I got in the digi-pack has a heat reactive label.  When I got it out of the pack the label had dark brown print on dark brown background.  Only if I got the light shining on it at the right angle could I make out some of the printing.  I thought this was an odd choice and reminded me of the Metallica black album cover.  Anyway, stuck it in my laptop to rip to my SONOS music system using EAC which takes a long time.  When it finished ripping and popped out, the label was white with black printing.  Amazing! I thought it had been designed to transform once it had been used. But then as the CD cooled it went dark again.  This has to be one of the coolest CD novelties I've seen in a long time.

B0019VTKIM|5.0|They say that epic movies can't really be made any more.  I would say that it's because we lack the innocence, not the resources because what we have here in \\"El Cid\\" is a breath of fresh air to the jaded modern (at least, to the jaded modern who does not want to be jaded).  Here is honor and courage and knightly subservience, all three being values from the past and none of which are given a showing today.  We reject any kind of submission or servanthood and indeed, there are times one must admit that the Cid's obedience goes too far.  Anyway, I suppose you want to hear about the movie.    I think the acting is great for the most part, though Sophia Loren can be a little too much for me at times.  You need to be able to appreciate the style of the acting and the action.  If you can do that, this movie has you.  It's honestly easier for me to believe in a movie if it has cheesy acting versus having computer animations which the eye immediately spots.  Also, I can't think of an epic that looked more, well...epic, thanks to shooting on location in Spain in real castles, etc.  I also appreciate small details, like filled, lived-in sets and also small ceremonial details like kissing the crossguard of a sword before battle or removing your helmet after coming in through a gate on horseback as a sign of politeness.  All these are done without explanation, and are better off for not having them.  All this is also well layered by what may be Miklos Rozsa's best film score (I'm biased).      But to return to my original discussion, what's great about this movie is that it has integrity.  Even the \\"baddies\\" have honor, one even agreeing with Heston's character at one point that one cannot live without honor.  I know it's not typically seen as \\"interesting\\" to have an uncompromising protagonist, but El Cid is so sublime that I say,\\"bring on the uninterestingness!\\"  I couldn't help compare this movie to the recent \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\", which deals with similar \\"Christian-Musliminteraction issues\\".  \\"El Cid\\" is more consciously Christian than \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\", and though this may put some people off, they would have to agree that Heston does his job and then some compared to Orlando Bloom.
0553582038|3.0|I have to concur with a number of the other reviewers in terms of the seemingly self-indulgent ramblings on heretofore minor and/or largely unsympathetic characters.  Jaime Lannister's evolution in this installment was interesting, but I could have done w/o roughly 80% of the Cersei chapters.  I also found the Iron Isles, and Dorne related chapters to be tedious at best.  Add in zero dedication to several of my personal favorite characters (e.g. Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, Bran Stark), and far too little dedication to previously central characters like Arya & Sansa Stark, and the overall result is a not ENTIRELY upleasant chore . . . but a chore nonetheless.

0674049160|5.0|I confess I experienced \\"flutterings\\" when I received this book. It is gorgeous beyond belief, and I do not exaggerate. Presented in an oversized format, in hardcover, and beautifully bound in cloth in a rich mustard color, this is a richly annotated and gloriously illustrated edition of one of the most popular novels in classic English literature. Edited by University of Virginia Professor, Patricia Meyer Spacks, the novel by Jane Austen is accompanied by rich insights that afford devoted fans and those new to the novel a more in-depth look into a story that has become dear to so many.<br /><br />The text chosen for this annotated edition is from the first edition, published in 1813. There is a lengthy introduction by Ms. Spacks, addressing pertinent matters such as Austen's life,her work, the enduring appeal of Pride and Prejudice and how it has affected the general consciousness, and predictably, the merits of literary annotation. Besides the annotations, the work is enriched with the inclusion of numerous illustrations, including movie posters associated with the dramatizations of P&P; illustrations and engravings of fashions during the period the novel was set in (bonnets, dress typically worn by gentlewomen and gentlemen of the time); portraits of authors that influenced Austen's work (e.g. popular novelist Maria Edgeworth); numerous other portraits/ paintings/photographs that depict life during Jane Austen's lifetime; and many more. I found it refreshing that instead of placing familiar illustrations depicting scenes from the novel itself, Ms. Spacks has chosen illustrations and photographs of places from Austen's life, and could very well have inspired Austen in her works.<br /><br />As for the annotations, they are of immense help to the Austen novice as there are handy explanations as to the meaning of certain words/ phrases not commonly used the way they were back then. The devoted Austen fan will delight in the fact-based annotations that serve to explain or observe the conventions of society during the period. Then there's Ms. Spacks own observations on events in the novel which enhance one's reading experience as the reader gains a fresh perspective as to the motivations of the novel's characters. In all, this is a treasure trove of insights and knowledge that have truly enriched my own understanding of P&P. I now eagerly await the Annotated Persuasion!n or observe the conventions of society during the period.

0553801473|2.0|Avid readers of the Game of Thrones series are in for a complete disappointment with this latest installment. First of all, Martin led us to believe that this book was already written when he published Book Four and would be the conclusion of the series. We waited for close to 6 years for this installment because publication was delayed several times. Martin finally produced a 900+ page book that simply rambled, went off the tracks in numerous areas, answered no questions, solved no issues, and filled the pages with more killing, treason, debachery, and supposed supernatural creatures.<br /><br />He abandoned Samwell, Rickon and Sansa completely. He added new, uninteresting characters and then killed them off. He left the reader stalled in never, never land with the obvious ploy to sell more books, not create a work that kept his readers enthralled with his world.<br /><br />By the end of the book I was wishing he would just say, \\"In conclusion, the dragons killed everyone and joined the Others! The end!\\" He did not leave me wishing for more. He left me feeling like I had been slogging through mud for days!<br /><br />This book is nothing but an obvious, self-serving contribution to his bank account and nothing more! If you are looking for a conclusion to this series I expect you will have to wait another 6 years if he lives that long. Expect to be led on by him and his publishers, and expect another statement the he is really writing a conclusion to the series. Robert Jordan he is not!<br /><br />BTW, I purchased both the hard back version (I preordered) and because of it's size, purchased it again for my kindle (which I just bought)! All in all... I stupidly contributed well over $50 for this book! I don't mind spending the money if it's worth it, but this was NOT worth it!

She shows where we miscommunicate with our pets and in that way also shows us how to communicate better so our pets can do what we really want them too. I highly recommend this book.

0307720748|5.0|For me this was a page-turner until the last three chapters.  In 2005, Branson did what many billionaires with too much money to spend do - he became an environmentalist and world crusader.  That's when I lost interest and it felt like Branson was trying to sell me on his world view.  I wish that I had bought the version with the red cover so that I would have been left with a more positive image of the man.  That being said, you gotta give a man kudos for moving in a different direction with his life after he has accomplished so many other things.  I can't say that if I were in his position that I wouldn't do the same thing.  We are a product of our environment and experiences after all.  He is still my role model in business matters as the entrepreneur that I can most relate to.  So, if you want an entertaining autobiography of a man who has been up and down in life and showed courage and instinct in all that he has done, grab this book and read it.  The last time that I read a book this fast was, um, never.  It's written in conversational prose, making for a quick read.  No big words here, just some British jargon that only well-rounded Americans will understand. (I'm patting my back here.) Oh, and the name-dropping throughout the book is fun.  Is there anyone this man doesn't know or isn't friends with?

B002VPE1WK|4.0|I've spent money on bags before. I have a Domke F2 [[ASIN:B001Q2074A Domke 700-02A F-2 Bag (Brown Waxwear Finish)]] that I like, but didn't love.<br /><br />I was in a position where I was going to be shooting up on a mountain, and knew I didn't want to hike with the shoulder bag - but I really didn't know that I wanted to buy an expensive backpack. I saw this on Amazon, and for $40 I decided to risk it.<br /><br />I was impressed as soon as it arrived - I was able to move everything I had in the Domke over to the backpack, with room to spare. I've since added and changed what I carry, and so far, everything is able to fit right into the backpack. Currently, I carry a gripped 7D with 70-200 attached. A 28mm f1.8. An 85mm f1.8. A 50mm f1.8. A Tamron 28-75mm f2.8. Two speedlites (580exII, 430exII) and a 24' ETTL cord. I also have all the associated collapsible softboxes, bounce cards, gels, batteries. In the side pocket I'm able to put a monopod and travel tripod.<br /><br />My Domke would have given up a while ago!<br /><br />It's not perfect though - but I didn't expect it to be for $40. The straps are short for a bigger guy (I'm 6' 210lbs and only just fit in). I wish it had a rain cover too.<br /><br />Since getting this, I've not even touched the Domke, so I'm debating selling that, then passing this one on too, and picking up a nicer back pack for permanent use.

The whole cast is mean-sprited too and that's just the animals alone. It throws every over-the-top cartoony slapstick & every screenwriting cliche in the book and not one of them works. There's nothing subtile about this fim. It shoves the \\"The Animals are our friends\\" morale in our faces soo much we might as well leave an inprint of it in our faces. It's tries soo hard to be funny it ends up failing in the end. By the time the film got serious,it was too late. The acting and the writing is forgettable. The story is tried & old which by the way gets derailed by pointless subplots and pointless cast members. The CGI is second-rate at best. It's like a bad Looney Tunes story with a touch of Captain Planet to make it worse. The only parts of the film I do like are the Animal Party nightmare scene and animal rampage but that's becuase it reminds of the flying rampage scence from Dumbo. but it fails to help the film in the long run. I give this [bleep] a -0 out of 10.

B000J5XS3C|5.0|The only problem I have with this system is that when you disable phantom power, it seems to stay on anyway. Only work around is to unplug the system until the light goes off or it just lights up again. Also, the blue power light is very irritating to the eyes and makes it difficult to read around it on the mixer. Other than that, I very much like the system. It can get plenty loud without clipping, it's pretty lightweight, and very simple to set up.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This game worked well on my htc DIC II; however its really laggy on my LG Optimus M. Overall this is one of the best games on the market. Although, the developers really need to work on some of the bugs; holding this gem back...
B004G600A4|5.0|Like many of you, I had no interest is seeing Tangled when it came out in theaters.  When I saw the trailer for it I thought &#34;Oh great, another boring princess movie&#34;.  To me, tangled looked like it was cheesy and not worth my time.  Boy was I wrong!  Ok, what made me want to see Tangled was when they begin to advertise that it was available on DVD and Blue-ray and they would show Repunzel getting covered by all her hair with only her eyes being visible.  So, finally I broke down and bought the movie and now I love it!!<br /><br />The story is great and Repunzel (played wonderfully by Mandy Moore) isn't your typical disney princess.  She's not some air-head bimbo waiting for a charming prince to come rescue her.  In fact, that's not even important to her.  What is important to her however, is that she be able to see the beautiful &#34;stars&#34; that are seen only on her birthday.  And seeing as her 18th birthay is the next day, she wants for her mother to let her out of the tower so she can finally see the &#34;stars&#34; up close for the first time.  But her mother who is actually the evil Mother Gothel (played by Donna Murphy) won't hear of it.  And the reason she won't let her go is because if she lets Repunzel go, she'll lose her youth because its Repunzel's long, flowing, golden hair, that keeps her young.<br /><br />So enter Flynn Rider (played by Chucks Zack Levi) a self-absorbed jerk who thinks the world revolves around him.  One day as fate would have it, he's running through the forest trying to keep two thugs who are chasing him; from getting their hands on a crown that's hidden in his satchel.  While trying to run from the two thugs, he comes upon Repunzel's tower although he doesn't know it, and climbs into the tower to get away from his pursuers.  Where he is whacked on the head by a frying pan.  When he finally comes to, he realizes that he's tied to a chair with long golden hair.  And understandably, he freaks.  At that point he confronted by Repunzel the one whose hair holds him captive. Once Repunzel realized that Flynn is not after her golden hair she agrees to let hiim go on one condition: that he gets her out of the tower and takes her to see the &#34;stars&#34; that appear every year on her bithday.  She tells that if he does this for her, she'll give him back his satchel; he agrees.  And what starts out as a matter of convenience for both, soon becomes a journey of self-discovery and personal growth.<br /><br />I love Repunzel, she has spunk and is full of energy.  And although she's naive she soon learns how to think for herself and to become her own person.  And Flynn Rider who is a jerk in the beginning, learns to think of others instead of always thinking of himself.  He also learns what true love is, and the meaning sacrifice.  And I must not forget Pascal (Repunzel's pet cameleon) and Maximus (Flynn Rider's horse).  They still show sometimes and you can't help but love them.  I mean this movie has everything, beautiful music, great songs, and amazing backgrounds.  And here's one more neat bit of info, all the actors do their own singing and they all do a wonderful job in my opinion. And hey, who knew Zack Levi could sing!!  I'm not going to spoil the ending for you, if want to know how Tangled ends; you'll have to see the movie for yourself. You won't regret it, trust me.hose hair holds him captive.

030745455X|1.0|I am very disappointed in the paperback book.  The description never said anything about water damage.  The top of the book - the first half of the book looks like it has mildew.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Dont waste your money if you have a droid phone. I bought this game but it wont ever install. If this is not going to work they need to give people their money back.
0399536108|5.0|I found this book highly inspirational and full of good ideas and view points. I had some trouble relating to the authors extraordinary career path, but I realize that is just my own doubts raising its head. Will keep recommending this book!
B00168OIOE|5.0|Great movie-highly recommend it!!  My husband, kids and I watch it over and over!  One of our favorites!  You won't regret it!
0060263857|5.0|oh the delicate understanding of a child`s thoughts... the understanding that us oldies too have happy memories of our childhood. i was so touched with sentiment bringing back my childhood amongst thatched barns and cart horses, cows and pigs and scurrying rats squealing behind the sitting room panelling that i have ordered the other two books immediately and sent charlotte on to my sister..read it read it read it..
B0010VD7EO|2.0|Not really a good theme running through this album, but there are probably three catchy tunes.  Band switches from electronica to acoustic guitar and it kinda doesn't make sense.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Being a huge Jane Austen fan - especially Pride and Prejudice - there simply is nothing to compare to this production of the book.  I had read the blue ray really made a difference and I believe it does.  The picture and sound quality are noticeably better and I enjoyed every minute of it.  One little difference that I just wasn't expecting - for each episode the entire before and after credits roll every time.  Not a big deal, just need to keep the remote close if you are watching more than one episode at a time.  Love it, love it, love it!
B004UUKDNA|4.0|\\"Pumped up Kicks\\" got some play on CSI New York and on the radio and that made me want to try this album.  Some folks compare it to MGMT style music, and that is a fair assessment - to a point.  Overall catchy tunes with the vibe of an 80\\"s style album.  It is not Led Zeppelin IV but you will want to play this more than once.  Great driving music.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|Great case, phone fits in like a glove.  The only drawback to this case is that the bottom doesn't have a low enough profile, and I can't dock it in my logitech  without taking it out of the case.  (this is a big deal for me)  If you aren't worried about docking it then by all means get one.  This phone is not that easy to get out of the case, so I had to buy another brand.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Just got netflex and almost didn't give this show a chance but I'm glad I did. It made my last two months of pregnancy go by so quickly. This and desperate housewives are my favorite series.
1451629184|4.0|A very interesting book about Jaycee's abduction. Some parts of the book were very disturbing to me. I didn't like to read about the details of how that sicko abused a tender 11 year girl, so I skimmed or skipped over those parts...but I know she felt like she needed to get her story out. I give her alot of credit. This was probably very therapeutic for her and helped her to heal. Considering her horrendous living conditions and years of emotional and sexual abuse, I was very impressed with her kind heart and how well spoken she was. God bless her and her daughters!! Thank you Jaycee for sharing your story with us...
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I was cautious in ordering this watch, because it seemed that the black version had the wrong model number.  I looked at the other colors available and the model numbers all seemed to end in \\"K2\\" (blue-SNK807K2, green-SNK805K2, tan-SNK803K2.)  At the time of purchasing, Amazon lists the model number as SNK809.  I was worried that this might be an old model, as there seemed to be SNK809K2 available elsewhere on the internet.  After a while I ended up purchasing the watch, and when it arrived I was happy to note that the watch model did have the K2 in it.             I have been very happy in the first two weeks of owning the watch.  It does seem to be pretty accurate. (mine anyway) The watch can last a while before needing to be wound in my experience.  I accidentally left my watch in a room in my house on a friday afternoon, and it ran out early sunday morning.  This is the only experience where it has run out so far, and is only an indication of how often it needs to be worn.      Overall, this watch feels to be very well built.  I am happy with the product so far. Great watch!
1881273873|4.0|I enjoyed this book - especially the quiz at the very back.  Learned lots about my love language, and particularly, what's NOT my love language and how that might have affected my past relationships.
B0002EXH54|3.0|As I've stated on Killing and So far, I tend to find Megadeth's 80's stuff to be a mix of ideas without any sort of structure.  thankfully the albums have grown on me.      I only have the original, although I'd like to get the 2011 version of this.  I've read it's suppose to be more of a true remaster.  I've heard most of the 04 remixes and they SUCK big time.  The songs just sound..  wrong.  It's the best way I can describe them.      When I first got this album I didn't like it.  I liked Peace sells, but the rest of the songs didn't do anything for me.  Devil's Island ang Good morning black friday grew on me.      Wake up dead is essentially an instrumental.  There are some vocals in the beginning, and a chant along part at the end, like in a couple other songs on here, but that's it.  I'm not a big fan of instrumentals, so I never listen to this one.    The Conjuring starts with Dave doing some snarling vocals in a sinister sort of intro.  Both the music and vocals sound sinister.  Then it erupts into a thrasher with great vocals and nice riffs.   It slows down a bit for what would make a good chorus, if they'd used it that way.  That kind of annoys me with this otherwise solid tune.    Peace sells, do I really have to describe this song?  We all know the famous drum beat and bass line, and the guitar lick at the beginning, to the lyrics, to the chant at the end.  Great song, a classic.    Devil's Island starts with a slower riff before moving into a faster song with a galloping guitar riff.  the chorus is a little simple, but at least there's some song structure to it.  The vocals are so fast I can't understand them.    Good morning black Friday is a decent song.  It starts off with a slow clean guitar intro with some lead guitar playing over it,    It's definitely not a ballad though.  It progressively builds as the drums kick in, and the guitars get heavier.  Dave has some snarling vocals, before a yell, signifying the beginning of the main part of the song.Then it becomes a really fast song, ultra fast guitars, really quick vocals I can't understand.  Well it's not quite that bad.      Bad Omen also has a slower intro, mixing heavy and clean guitars, before, of course, building up to a faster song.  They didn't really know very many other paces at the time.      I Ain't Superstitious has a terrible flow to it.  I really don't like this one.  If they'd kept the same pace or even made it faster like they'd do, it'd be fine, but the song has way too many pauses that throw the song off of any sense of flow.  If that made any sense.    My Last Words needed a chorus.  It just felt like there wasen't something holding it together.  I like the verses.  It's yet another fast song, and it's alright.  I'll still listen to it, but it could've been so much better.    Overall if you're looking to get into Megadeth, this is considered a classic.  Rust in Peace is better, and I'd recommend that one and Countdown to extinction, which is a little more accessible.  But this is considered a classic, so you could get it.  I'd recommend either getting the original or the 2011, which I haven't heard, so I can't speak to.  But the 04 remasters suck.  Avoid them at all costs.
0767827791|5.0|This movie is a bit dated and the plot perhaps a little silly, but it's a very satisfying romance story and fun to watch.  The theme music stays with you.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|5 Stars,  The Darkest Batman Ever and the Best by Far.  Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker will go down into history. Alas the worse performance is also there, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, with her pig nose.  She and her brother Jake Gyllenhaal, have yet to find any acting skills.  They maybe Hollywood's cheap flavor of the month, but neither can act.  Back to some of Best Actors in Hollywood in this movie.  Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), and Batman (Christian Bale), and Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart).  Director Christopher Nolan has somewhat re-created this experience by shifting his film from 2.40:1 aspect ratio (through most of the film) to 1.78:1 in the IMAX scenes.  This is a MUST Own Blu Ray, just simply put.
0061537934|5.0|You will both laugh and cry as Enzo, the dog, shares with us his life story and that of his owner, Denny.  `The Art of...' is an amazing story of life, loyalty and unconditional love.  But don't be fooled into believing that everything on the page is pure fiction.... whilst Enzo may be fiction, Denny's story was based very much on fact!  The book is an emotional roller-coaster ride from the first page and Stein's attention to detail is remarkable.  But keep in mind, whether reading `The Art of...' in the UK or the US, our so called justice systems are simply `systems', they are not JUSTICE!  John Bartlett
B00003CXXM|5.0|An interesting spy experience that unfolds just in time for the viewer to follow. I recommend this DVD for pure entertainment.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|I'll get my criticisms out of the way first. Danny Boyle has always been rather a self-conscious film-maker and never one to shy away from style-heavy effects in his film. '127 Hours' is no exception from the split screen opening to that big (though admittedly impressive) track-back shot when Aaron realises the full extent of his predicament. Then there's the use of 'trick' moments where we think one thing is happening but actually it's just a dream or hallucination. There are also a couple of gratuitous moments, for example the freeze frame on the girl's cleavage. Did we really need that?     Putting these to one side, however, this is an extraordinary film about an extraordinary event.     James Franco is brilliant (and in my opinion should have won the Oscar over the gorgeous Colin Firth). What's most impressive is how Boyle has managed to make such a drama-packed and gripping film on such a limited canvas. I know the film employs flashbacks, but essentially it's all set in a single square metre at the bottom of a gorge. In places the tension was wracked so high I forgot to breathe! This is a film that makes you experience the physical endurance of the main character.     One final thing. If you get the chance, watch the alternative ending. Normally these only last a couple of minutes but here it's over twenty! There's lots of unused material and it shows how by changing the tone and duration of the end of a film you change the entire thing. I think Danny Boyle definitely made the right call in concluding the film as he did.

It does exactly this, allows you to auto-group items, detects incoming items and tries to group them automagically, and presents a clean slick interface for your new groups. Well done.
B005CMGKTG|5.0|This is The best movie I have seen in a long time, I have been a Star Blazers (Space Battleship Yamato) Fan from Childhood and Was so Happy they made a live action movie, The CG of this Film was Awesome It makes you feel and think that they raised and rebuilt the Yamato and used it in the film. The acting was great even with reading the subtitles My heart raced during the action on the screen and overall I fell back in love with The Star Force and I have watch this movie online almost daily Now I have a copy of it I will have to watch it over and over again, This is a must Have for any Star Blazers (Space Battleship Yamato) Fun To thumbs way up For this Film.......

B0053Q9DHW|1.0|Having just watched this new version, and was re-reading the book and just lately saw again the 2005 version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson, I hate that I spent $20 on this new version. Did not like it at all. It seemed that too many important scene are rushed together, I suppose for the sake of time. There is no no real time spent on the developing of the relationship of Jane and Mr.Rochester. The reviews that I did read, went on and on about how great it was and so much better. But even my husband did not like it.
034552554X|5.0|Abandoned at birth Victoria is a ward of the state of California until she turns eighteen and is emancipated. Her only true chance of a family had been when she was nine at the last of a chain of foster families. It is with Elizabeth that Victoria learned the secret meanings behind families. It is this love of flowers that kept her going through the last eight years of living in group homes, takes her off the streets following here emancipation, and reunites her with a person from her past and ultimately gives her the chance at the family she could have and desperately wanted . It is also her love of flowers that will ultimately take her off the streets and give her another chance at the loving family she could have had, despite how much she fights it.    The Language of Flowers is beautifully written and i felt an instant connection with the characters especially Victoria. It is one of those books you read and instantly want to pick up anything else the author has written only to find that it was a debut novel.
B0000E5PEE|5.0|I like the music of Ennio Morricone and I like Fado, so what could be better than Morricone's music sung by Portugal's famous Dulce Pontes? I was not disappointed. She has a passionate voice which brings out the best of the composer. I loved this disc.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|This is --without exception... the best new album I have heard in YEARS, period.  If the Grammy Awards don't honor this-- they should be shut down for lack of taste.  I bought it 2 weeks ago... I've listened to it twice a day since-- and I still cannot stop.  I've bought 5 more copies-- to be given to my very good friends for their enjoyment.  For ten bucks--you can't beat the value.

B005F82X48|5.0|What a wonderful album!  You can really tell that Icon For Hire put a lot of soul into this album.  An amazing blend of electronic and rock!  These guys are all talented musicians, and I'm very ecstatic that I purchased their album.<br />Trust me, buy this album.  In fact, I'm listening to this album right now while drinking a Dr. Pepper, and I don't even care that it's only Tuesday and I'm stuck at work.  That's how good Icon For Hire's music makes me feel.
B0058A119G|5.0|Wow !    Not to be a downer, but I think Barbra is all too aware of her age, (and those precious vocal chords of hers that will soon be turning 70 LONG before any of us want them to...)  And she is taking this time to record some of Alan and Marilyn's timeless melodies and lyrics before the passage of time (that damned thief) begins to take it's toll.    Her timeless instrument is, sadly, beginning to show it's age, so we should all rejoice in the fact that she can still produce albums of this quality.    I pray she has at least ONE more \\"Broadway Album\\" in her, and that she can sing for years to come with every note captured by today's technology.    Every soaring, peerless note matters at this point, and those who are reading this should drink in the wonder that continues to be Ms. Streisand's gift to those lucky enough to escape through a gifted ear.
B004INNRFK|4.0|Oops he did it again (I'm bemused he called himself an idiot again). The producer with the pop star ambitions is back with another gala concert featuring artists on his production roll...and those not produced by him as well.  I picked this up as Donna Summer is performing Last Dance. The same reason I bought the Thank God It's Friday cassette when I was a kid. Summer's two hits On The Radio and Last Dance are not Foster productions but I'm glad to see her again after such a long spell.  Some songs he produced for Toni Braxton and Kenny Rogers are sung by other singers. Most are performed in a medley format as the singers are introduced one by one. Hitman Returns is a great variety as it packs lots of famous performers in one show.  For me, it was delightful to be watching artists I have not heard from in years or even decades such as Earth, Wind & Fire, Kenny Loggins, Michael Bolton, Kenny G, Chaka Khan and All-4-One. It also gave me a chance to catch performances from singers I'm not familiar with like Gary Wright, Jackie Evancho and Lara Fabian. The most amazing outfit of the evening award goes to Natalie Cole. The gown looks like it's painted on her.  Normally, the live CD in CD/DVD combos is rather redundant as is the case here. Nonetheless, it is still a great one as 11 of the best are featured. However, before you purchase a variety show, you might want to consider that you may not like everyartist featured.  This product is itself a curious thing, like a vanity project. It puts the producer, not the singer center stage. Watching this, I got the impression that Foster's interested in being a pop star and getting all the love. It's like he tries so hard. Even at the show's end, Donna Summer magnanimously handed her mic to him. I think she understood his need for attention.  Producers are the unsung heroes. But don't you worry Mr Foster, this DVD will be a great reminder as to why you are a true professional :)
0439023521|5.0|Quick Thoughts:  Courage. Fear. Survival.  Pain. Triumph  Well everyone has reviewed this every which way and back.  I thoroughly enjoyed this story.  The book is about the games but I didn't find myself tapping my foot impatiently before I got to the main part of the story. I was enthralled from the beginning.  I knew this book was \\"awesome\\" when Peeta said \\"Because...because...she came here with me.\\"  I resisted this book for so long because the concept reminded me of Lord of the Flies.  Here there is a strong connection with the characters and there is a back story that matters.  I loved this book.
0670022411|5.0|Wonderful book!  Couldn't put it down.  Engrossing use of history, romance, and science.  I am eagerly anticipating the sequel.  Definitely recommend it.
B00000JPH6|5.0|This movie is amazing. I didn't see this until last year ( i am 23) and i mother-freakin' love this movie. It has great story telling, the characters are all very interesting, and the visuals are fantastic!
0545265355|5.0|Read the three books in 4 days.  I couldn't put them down.  Loved the 2nd and 3rd books as much as the first. Characters are interesting and you can't help cheering for them.  I have recommended this book to all my book loving friends adults and young adults alike.  Eagerly awaiting more from this author.
0765365278|5.0|I was wary of reading this series. Especially since its only the first installment and I am VERY impatient. I just finished Rothfuss' two books and I was dying for a good story. I normally don't read new authors but I took a chance and read this and LOVED IT. So Amazing and exciting to discover such a great author. Looking forward to the next in this series!
B0058OUJA4|5.0|hex is prettier w/ better sound effects but this game is much better for the customization,  more towers, larger map sizes.

B0058A119G|2.0|IMHO as an audio engineer/producer....    This album is over produced and has wayyyyy toooo much artificial reverb...huge cavern. There is nothing natural about the sound of her voice.      Some will like this as it is an aesthetic.  But to me it is also a mask.    My advice for Barbara...find a new producer.  The string section sounds smaltzy.

Gives you a glimpse into what the human body is capable of when everything is broken down to its most basic.  I couldn't put this book down, finished it in one sitting.
B001EC3JME|5.0|My Husband owns a repair shop and has a flashlight attached to his hip at all times.  He is constantly reordering cases from his supplier (MAC Tools) because they are always ripping.  I told him about this case and he decided to try it out since the cases he got from his tool supplier were costing him 3x the cost of this holster clip-on.  His flashlight measures 5 1/2 inches long and a girth of 1 inch at the bottom.  It fit perfectly in this case!  He loves it!  He stated that it is solidly constructed and it is just like what police officers use.  It stays in place on his belt and does not move.  He loves it so much that he asked me to order more for his another mechanics.  You can't beat the price and free shipping if you have Amazon Prime.<br /><br />If you are concerned about the opening at the bottom of this case and your expensive flashlight falling out, don't be.  It will stay in place - it will not slide out.  The whole concept and design of this clip-on holster is unique and you will be extremely happy.
B001VIRWA6|2.0|I read the previous reviews and thought, \\"well, let's check out the samples\\". I had already heard the full version of Scream and it wasn't bad. So I wanted to hear some of the rest before buying. Not gonna. It sounds a little too Euro-popish for this Soundgarden/Cornell fan who goes waaaaaay back to the Fopp record. This record was made in 2009 and TOTALLY gives a secure reason as to why in January of 2010 a Soundgarden reunion was announced. You can only depart so far from your roots before you lose your fan base. Makes you wonder if life outta the states for Chris is having or had (if he is still living in Europe)a positive effect...
1451629184|5.0|In a few short words, this was a great book it was interesting all the way to the end.Warning when you start reading you can't put down so start on the weekend !
B004KSQN7C|1.0|I never received my CD in the mail. I did however receive an empty package. I even went so far as to notifiy the postal police that my package was stolen. Postal police did nothing. Got no response from amazon.com! Don't know how to recover this loss. Was looking forward to using this CD to workout and now I am still without my jams. Will never order a CD from amazon.com again!
0380713802|5.0|Although Bryson starts this journey through Europe rather slowly, the book soon picks up the pace once he enters more countries and provides us great descriptions of people and places in that quirky way he has. It is really funny and a great book to take along and read on the trains in Europe.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Season Four left us with one hell of a cliffhanger. The whole of the story arc explodes and rushes through what is going to be the end of the line, at least in terms of the five seasons of meta-plot. The plot is wrapped up nice and tight. Anyone that has watched the show knows this was to be the final season. But I'm going to keep this without spoilers.<br /><br />We know what to expect - we're given the industry standard: 5.1 Dolby Digital, and the DVD's visual gives the season a pretty good edgy and grainy look. When I finally buckle and buy them on BD, I am sure the quality will likely overshadow this DVD set and end the grainy effect. The acting, digital F/X, and the soundtrack are all so much better than what came before. The special features... wow. We get a little commentary (seriously, one commentary track on the The End episode 4), the Ghostfacers web-series (almost like watching a train wreck and it suddenly turns to flowers and rainbows; these guys need their own show), a deleted scene from episode 9, then magic: a walk through the Supernatural Apocalypse survival guide. I would have bought the DVD just for this. Anything that focuses on the guest stars is always a treat.<br /><br />So sit back, relax with some popcorn and your fellow horror fans, and hang on tight - this is the end game. This season is going to be what you've been waiting for.
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|Timeless, good selection of songs both traditional and Tull.  They did a nice job here and it has sold well.    Be sure to read about Jethro Tull (the band...not the agronomist!) on wikipedia.  There is an excellent write up.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|the best defense game I have played on an Android device!  Could use a better soundtrack...  Grid could be more HD when scaled on my HTC sensation.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This movie came to me in perfect condition. There wasn't a single scratch on either of the discs. The whole thing looked brand new,and got here in great time!
B005ER6STG|4.0|This movie is very rough. Give it a harder rating then, don't cut a movie to make it not what it was intended to be. Or make it safer for us. Give us a chance to decide for our selves' if we can handle it or not. I still Belive most people can think for there self. The uncut running time is 104 min.
030788743X|5.0|A quick glance at the cover-flap copy gives you a strong idea of what you'll get in this book. And the book proceeds to deliver on the promise of the ad copy--unusual in itself. But the book captures adolescent life and pseudo-life pinpointing the anxieties of coming-of-age, but not needlessly harping one them. Exceedingly well done and a lot of fun for those looking for a quick, light read to fill out the remnants of the summer.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I grew up in the 80's, my ears & eyes filled with some of the greatest music of all time, the artists everyone knows & a lot only a few of us remember. I listen to it all- Madonna, MJ, The Kingston Trio, Herb Alpert, Travis Tritt- I'm no snob. Good music is good, period, and genre alone doesn't define what's good. At one time I owned over 600 CD's, and truly would've considered myself an audiophile. But from turning from an idealist into a pragmatist, from having religion to having none, I fully acknowledge that I am not a happy person by nature. I'm a glass-half-empty kind of person. I like to complain about the hideous nature of the modern musical industry, pop & country especially, and commiserate with friends about absurd concert ticket prices, the lack of talent around, the endless tanned & blonde-haired twits calling themselves artists, etc.- things that we all have to endure. I hate 99.9% of the work put out today, and to buy an entire album is something I've done only once in the 2010's. This is that one album.<br /><br />I won't compare Adele to other artists, because people do enough of that. I won't break down every song for you here or attempt to convey deep & mystical insights into the work- that, too, has already been done. For me, this album is about pure pleasure. Pleasure to listen to it the whole way the first time through, pleasure to get more out of with each listening, pleasure that I didn't just find one song on an album that's halfway-decent (nearly unheard of now). So I'll leave it short & sweet for you. Every track has it's own personality. From the rousing beginning through the ending, every emotion is conveyed, yet the artist manages neither to oversing or undersing. She sings about love & relationships, things I normally care nothing about & have heard about ad nauseum. I'm the kind of girl you take to a movie about Soviet submarines, not chick flicks. How Adele's gotten the songs just right, how she's somehow made it all fresh to me again, I have no clue. Why I love it so much, beyond the obvious talent of the artist, is not explainable. I just do. Not overproduced or underproduced, the musicianship of the backup players is great (particularly the pianist), but not obstrusive. In a soulless, glossy, size 0-world that's quickly going down the tubes, I've found one itty-bitty oasis auditorily. For that, Adele, I thank you. Young you may be in years, but not in voice nor in soul.<br /><br />I listen to this album daily, all of it, and it gives me a glimmer of belief that maybe not all is lost, either in music or in reality. Hear it all yourself. Hopefully, you'll feel the same.<br /><br />Peace, wherever & whenever you can get it.no clue.

B001E75QH0|5.0|I received exactly what was advertised.  The movies are packed in slim cases so all four movies fit in a neat little box that doesn't take up a lot of space on your shelf.  You can't beat the price either.  I'm totally satisfied.
0062060554|3.0|SPOILER ALERT.  I am totally baffled by one plot development in this book and it's driving me crazy; I hope someone can set me straight.  Near the end, Chris's friend Claire calls \\"Ben's\\" school and ascertains that he still works there, albeit as a lab assistant not a teacher, and that he's in school that very day but unable to come to the phone.  Yet we later learn that the real Ben has been in Italy for months, presumably working as an architect.  Claire would have used the name of the real Ben, not the faux Ben, Mike, when calling the school.  Huh?<br /><br />Can anyone explain to me why the school said Ben worked there when it was later revealed he didn't?  And I don't think Claire was lying to Chris about it.  It looks to me like a gigantic mistake in the book, but I can't imagine it would slip by an editor, so I'm guessing that I'm just missing something. Help!<br /><br />By the way, I found this one of the most riveting, can't-put-it-down bad books I've ever read.  I kept telling myself that nothing was credible, it wasn't terribly well-written, but it did entertain me for the three days it took to read.
B002FGU44Y|5.0|Worth the price you pay for. they fit really well. Please refer to the Teva size chart only, before you order.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|This Nutini Album is golden...BUT the seller sent me a promotional item not made for sale and that needs to go back to the record comapany if requested etc. the label says :/ thought i was buying the actual legit album! not buying from someone who is selling items they got for promotional use
0307346617|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of this genre and this is one of my all time favorites! It hits the nail on the head and is exactly what zombie apocolypse fans want!Buy it!
B004UID2LC|5.0|It used to be great but a few weeks aga it stopped working. It does not download or play any more videos. I looked back at the application in amazonstore and got the update.  After the update was done it works even better than before!! so happy with it ;)
1400049628|2.0|I LOVE World War Z. I just wanted to start with that, it is truely an awesome zombie book. I am also a huge fan of this genre in general. That all said, this book is boring. I think Brooks took a basic survival guide removed \\"communists\\",\\"rioters\\", \\"Lions\\", \\"Tigers\\", and \\"Bears\\" and inserted \\"Zombies\\".
B0058A11AK|5.0|This record is Barbra's finest work in the last 20+ years.  Her voice shines and glows in every song.  Some harsh comments were received on my review of \\"Love Is the Answer\\" because I just expected Streisand's voice to be top notch, which I didn't feel was as good as her previous albums.      This review of \\"What Matters Most\\" is completely different.  It is not only great due to Streisand's perfect pitch, but she chose the Bergman's best songs.  The arrangements are stunning and this entire piece of mastery is just gorgeous.  There is a review stating the record contains artificial reverb, and let me assure you, it does not.  There is no element that is overproduced or artificial.  Maybe it's because our ears have become so distorted with all the garbage playing on the airwaves today, we're not used to a singer who can sing without autotune or songs that must be studio produced for release.  Everything about WMM is true perfection.
0060555661|5.0|The book I recieved was awsome. Even better than discribed and it was described as new. Also, I recieved the book in 8 days!! Will definitly but from this vendor again.
B00006JIA4|5.0|I absolutely adore Queen, so I was and still am, really thrilled to get this CD. I love CD 1 and 2. Three, not so much. In my opinion, instead of having tributes and little known songs, CD 3 could have had more original songs from the band that I wished were included in the first place. But, all in all, I'm very happy with this purchase!
B0034G4ORM|2.0|This movie is very hokey and should be retitled Battle Louisiana. If you know LA the first thing you notice that it isn't in LA. Went downhill from there. Otherwise it's better than than the remake of War of the Worlds...but not much.
B004X60QE2|5.0|This is a great show.  We don't care for reality shows, have enough of that in real life, so we really like to watch this one.  Every week it's all fresh and new with all kinds of wondrous and funny things happening to the town of Eureka.  It's a nice, clean, family show that is fun to watch.  It arrived in great shape and we thought the price was really good for this dvd.  When we ordered Amazon had the best price for season 1 and 2 so we purchased both.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|Using your shirt pocket is very handy for the bluetooth device but have found it occasionally makes a phone call if it gets bumped accidently.  This carry pouch allows you to carry the bluetooth device when you don't want to always have it on your ear without it making phone calls because it gets bumped.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I bought this undisputed collection on blu-ray because it looks great and the picture quality is crystal clear.and i also liked all of the rocky films
1451629184|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been molested as well aa abducted and molested.  Jaycee just said like it was. She didn't sugarcoat anything nor did she over do anything.  When I started to read this book, I cried and cried and cried until I got to page 49.  It has helped me to start working on my situation.  I was molesed when I was 7 years of age by one family member and then for 2 more years by another family member.  I have been able to face what has happened to me over 45 years ago.  If having 2 family members molesting you, what about teachers (more then one), having to go to court against them, then the on going atempts from the local community as well as other teachers until I was able to leave that state for ever.  This books would help others understand what they went through and what their molester might have been thinking and why.  Even thought everyone has a different story, this book will really help you to start to heal.  I have bought books for my therapist and others that could use it to help others.
0811874192|5.0|Bought the book for my Mother's Birthday---she was thrilled with it, as she lives in a small condo, and this does not take up much room---can have various centerpieces, all in one small book!   Thank you to whoever thought of such a thing!
B004US4K2C|3.0|At first I was absolutely in love with this launcher,and bought several of their themes.  however,it seems to randomly forget the buttons I&apos;ve set with cyanogenmod.  Give it a try, but wait a few days to make sure it works correctly before you buy any of the themes.  Would definitely be 5 stars if it weren&apos;t for this bug
B00002E224|5.0|yes there is a lot of talking in this movie. but if you like movies with young love then you will like this one. as a matter of fact i saw this in the movies with my ex girlfriend back in 1995. and till this day i just couldn't remember the name of it till a few weeks ago. when i purchased this on dvd.its a keeper..great film.
B0042YHC38|1.0|It was really hard to view the functions of the iphone through the screen when it was daylight. Great fit, and the material is light but a bad screen.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Lots of fun, and tough as hell. Leader boards, community maps, and some decent graphics. Worth the price of admission.
B001PBRCVI|5.0|What a kaleidoscope of emotions!  Reading this book brought joy, sadness, hope, triumph, shame, fear, and so much more.  A masterful writing displaying the sometimes disturbing links to our past.  I couldn't put the book down and as one critic mentioned, the situation surrounding Sarah's key leaves a lingering residue of thought.
B0042816YK|5.0|[[ASIN:B005GQXZGY Eat, Pray Die [HD]]]    Wonderful movie - satisfied. I will watch it many times. This shouldn't be necessary - I give the order 5 stars.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Two incredibly talented musicians!  What a great way to showcase a classical instrument by wrapping it up in today's music.  I listen to this CD constantly and haven't tired of a single note.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|No need to tell everybody that this is an awesome game... =)<br /><br />Controls perfect for the touch screen. Graphics are very good. Game play keeps getting better and better. Simple game but fun, fun, fun...
0061537969|5.0|This is a great book from the first page.  You don't have to love racing or even know much about it to enjoy this moving book but if you are a racing fan it is even more indredible.  Also if you ever wanted to know what your dog or cat was thinking this book will answer many questions for you.  Have fun and read away!
B003203GWO|5.0|When I first heard people were boycotting this book because it preaches killing God, I laughed. Seriously laughed. It's been touted as unChristian. If only those people read more about the different sects of Christianity, they would see it runs very parallel to Gnosticism.<br /><br />Read this book. It is charmingly written and had me feeling for the characters as they went through their trials, victories and challenges. Very well written with believable characters.
B0058A119G|1.0|There are four of us in this office. We listen to music during the day and do quite a lot of downloading. This review is of the 20-Song MP3. Here are our comments.<br /><br />Shaq: When I saw that Star-bra Brice-sand, winner of the Phony, Scammy and Flemmy awards and the Only Artist to have a Hot Fudge Sundae in Each of the Last Five Minutes, was releasing yet another mish-mash re-hash of previously released stuff I thought to myself \\"Oh Gawd! Not more of THIS!!!\\"<br /><br />Renata: Our supervisor says we usually have impeccable taste in music, But when we downloaded this collection, after playing the whole thing through 3 or 4 times, we are forbidden to ever play it again by the rest of the staff. She won't let us play Movie Album. Love is the Answer or Village Vanguard either. We have to give her credit, though, because she did give it a try. We all wanted to like the music but now we are like \\"what were we thinking. . .\\"<br /><br />Kelli: This issuance is devoted to the songs of Barbra's longtime friends the Bergers, but it's painfully clear she just doesn't have the chops to make these songs sing the way she used to. Compare the 10 songs on disc 2, all previously released ad infinitum, to the minimal smattering of \\"new\\" material on disc 1 and you'll agree: she sounds congested and heavy, like a wounded buffalo trudging uphill during the mating season. I shudder to think what this collection would sound like without the extensive sonic washing, dubbing, equalizing, tweaking, overlaying and filtering it went through prior to release!<br /><br />Raj: I guess adding the 2nd disc of already-released material is supposed to make it appear like she's actually been working, producing something, but the only thing being produced as far as I can see is income, with extra royalties for those Berger's! Any other artist could have fit this whole collection of 20 songs onto one CD and saved their fans some money. Not $trei$and! She's got EXPENSES!<br /><br />(Tewlip's comments would have gone here. She is on maternity.)<br /><br />Shaq: To all die-hard Barbra fans: If you've already got your wallets out, be prepared to keep them out! As has been done on past albums, this package is being released in multiple \\"incarnations\\", i.e. CD, 2 CD, 2CD/DVD, QVC, IUD, XYZ, etc. This has become the norm for The Big B.S., allowing her to double (and triple) dip into the paychecks of her \\"completist\\" devotees, forcing them to pay again and again and yet AGAIN for the same old stuff so that they/she can pay the taxes on that Pacific Cliff House she hides from the world in.<br /><br />Renata: Sucker's Beware! Think twice before you pay heed to the multitudinous bogus \\"rave\\" reviews posted here by Streisand's staff and the fan sites that link to this product and who therefore earn a commission on sales. After throwing our money away on this mess we have vowed never again to believe their ridiculous tripe. Going forward we will take the suggestion of another reviewer and sample music first on YouTube or Rhapsody and then decide for ourselves.<br /><br />Our consensus:<br /><br />For those who enjoy wounded animal sounds and mating calls, there are numerous wildlife specials airing on PBS, Discovery and Animal Planet daily. Save your money and turn on the TV instead of buying this CD.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|My son spent his birthday money on this headset, and for about two weeks, he thought they were awesome. Then the left side stopped working. Amazon was great and sent a replacement, but 31 days after we got it, the same problem happened and the left side stopped working. Too late for a return, naturally. I definitely do not recommend these.
1594744769|3.0|The author's inspiration for writing this book makes it truly original. I loved how he incorporated the pictures. That being said, the book is defiantly the author's first.
030746363X|5.0|The 4 hour body is a very interesting book.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that is interested in loosing weight.
1451629184|5.0|I got halfway through this book and wished I had never started. It is hard to read and very honest. That being said, I am glad I bought it to help support Jaycee's Foundation. And make sure to read to the end. It was important for me to read that she is doing better and it getting her life on track.

B004VMUS9G|3.0|I love this alarm. It&apos;s loud, impossible to sleep through and offers some creative ways to get you moving. My only problem is this: on two separate occasions I have had the alarm not go off. One of those days I wound up sleeping through my early morning work shift. When I investigated I found that vacation mode had been turned on, making the alarms not go off. The only time I have this problem is at the beginning of the week. Very strange.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|This game is challenging as well as fun.  If you haven&apos;t played hex defense yet I recommend that you pick that game up and reserve this game for after you beat hex defense. I&apos;m not sure if they are the same developers (if not than this is a blatent rip off) but they are both top notch games.
6300246817|4.0|When I ordered the product, I didn't see that it was a two-video movie so my husband was a bit disappointed about that.  However, we have chosen to keep the product and then we ordered one that was advertised as one-video.   We love the movie itself.  We have seen it both on TV and at the theater many years ago.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was unfontunately a series ended before it's time.    This is hands down on the top of my favorite sci fi series of all time, hands down.    The brain child of Joss Weadon, this lovely series was well written, well acted, and had just the right budget.    I can't really say enough about it.  Just if you are a fan od sci-fi, space shows, and maybe secretly like the odd western, this series should be on your shelves.
B002SAS26E|5.0|Wow!  One of the easiest games to pick up and play and so much fun!  Essentially, you are trying to collect sets of cards representing market items to sell so you can collect the corresponding tokens.  The first tokens of each market item are worth more than later tokens so collecting and selling early is desirable.  At the end of the round you add up the points on your tokens and high score wins that round.  Three rounds make a game and take about 20-30 minutes altogether.<br /><br />What makes this game special is the CAMELS!  On your turn you may either collect cards or sell cards.  You have 5 face up cards to choose from and besides market items, there are camels.  You can never pick up both camels and market cards.  You may pick up all the camels OR one market card and replace from the draw pile or pick up more than one market card in which case you have to replace however many you take from your hand and/or your herd of camels!  Whoever has the most camels at the end of a round gets a 5 pt bonus token also so there're some tough choices to make regarding whether to pick up camels or market cards.  Scores are often tight, so each choice is important and can make the difference between winning and losing.  Besides playing beautifully, this game is visually and tactilely beautiful also.  The market chips are solid, fun to handle and as beautiful as the cards.  It all comes in a small box with an incredibly designed insert for storage.  Every time I take the lid off the box, I get that same feeling I got the first time--the subtle excitement of anticipation of playing a beautiful game.  This is most definitely my favorite 2 player only game.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This game is awesome. It&apos;s a lot of fun and a really solid experience. I kind of wish there were more levels just because I wanted there to just be more!! Love this, probably favorite app of mine. No joke.
0307463745|3.0|This work is a collection of 80+ short stories on how things could be done differently in business (1-2 pages/each topic). These topics are put under labels like takedows, go, progress, productivity, competitors, evolution, promotion, hiring, damage control and culture.<br /><br />Some of the short stories are really excellent and give indeed a fresh perspective, some are just very general comments and some topics no doubt will make you wonder if it would fit your situation. Keep in mind that these short stories are matched to the situation of the authors (and their own specific business experiences) and are therefore not always transferable to different business settings. Some examples given by the authors would be an excellent fit for a small-team business.<br /><br />Overall it is a bit of a mix on project and time management tools, entrepreneurial attitudes and sometimes just common sense.<br /><br />The book reads very easily and some stories make you reflect.

B00005N6KG|5.0|If you want truly portable headphones, these are it. I use them for my netbook and they fit awesome in the sleeve. They do not get in the way, the cable is durable for as much as I wrap it up and they are really light weight and comfortable. Sound is pretty decent too for the price! I highly recommend this product.
B0018LX9T4|5.0|I had read a couple of reviews for this movie years ago but had never seen it. We ordered it from Amazon, received it promptly and in great condition. Me and the wife watched it for date night after we went out to dinner and let me just say- it was a great date night (wink, wink). Excellent movie, intriguing, captivating, entertaining...  What else is there to say? I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is open-minded. If you are one of those people that can only handle 'vanilla'- then don't even go for this one as you won't enjoy the mental and physical games played in this movie. James Spader does a tremendous job in this.

B00005NKCM|5.0|Upstairs Downstairs is a high class soap opera beautifully written and acted. The series shows the doings between the Bellamy family (the folks upstairs) and their servants (the folks downstairs) and how they interact. Woven into the soap opera is British history during Edwardian times up until the mid 1900s. During one show King Edward comes to dinner at the Bellamy residence leading to much cleaning and cooking. Along the way comes a big surprise for both the king and the Bellamy family.<br /><br />The show covered a wide range of sensitive topics including homosexuality, suicide, war and the effects thereof.<br /><br />This is one of the best British television series produced and while made in the 70s is timeless.<br /><br />Recommend.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|Here it goes again. Mystery is, is this after the series or a remastering. Up to you to decide this one.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is a very interesting book that switches cleverly between two time periods; the current time and the World War II.  It is well written and spell binding. It also includes questions for book clubs.  I can't wait for the movie to come out.  I hope it holds true to the book.
032147404X|5.0|I have been a hobbyist photographer for more than 40 years.  It has taken me 8 years to finally put down that old NikonF and commit my interest fully to the realm of digital photography.  So, with my new digital SLR, the owners manual, and a couple of lenses, I returned to some of my favorite haunts, looking to capture in vivid clarity, those scenes of forest and ocean, mountain and sunset, flower and insect, people and events. In short, as any photographer will tell you, I wanted to depict that which is beautiful in the world.  I was disappointed.  I new I had a good piece of equipment, I just didn't know how to use it properly to get those sharp \\"in focus\\" shots all the time, to shoot in low light and get consistently desirable results.  Bottom line, the digital camera is capable of doing so much that I was lost in a morass of buttons, switches and settings, not understanding how to best utilize all of these fantastic tools to get the best results possible under all the varied conditions a photographer will find him or herself.  I needed a book, and I found a book.    Scott Kelby has put together the most user friendly catalog of instruction I have ever read.  Infused with his home-spun humor, Scott takes you on several photo expeditions.  One day its' weddings, the next day its' landscapes, portraits, cityscapes.  And all the while he is telling you how to best utilize that great camera you're holding, helping us to understand in terms we can understand.  This book is full of priceless information.  If you own a point-and-shoot camera, buy this book.  As soon as I have absorbed volume 1, I'll be purchasing Scott Kelbys' \\"Digital Photography\\", volumes 2&3.  This book is to photographers, what oxygen is to our bodies, you need it.
B0000714BP|4.0|So I ordered this movie becaue it's my fav movie of all time, I have to say I have watched it over and over and over again! The only down side is the shipping of this movie.

Still have to say YAY for this movie! just wish that you could pick who is the carrier that will ship this item! UPS SUCKS

030726999X|5.0|PERFECT ENDING TO HIS TRIOLOGY.  IF YOU HAVE READ HIS FIRST 2 BOOKS AND CANNOT WAIT FOR HIS THIRD TO COME OUT IN PAPERBACK - I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU BUY THIS HARDCOVER BOOK WHICH IS ACTUALLY LESS MONEY THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING CHARGED RIGHT NOW FOR THE PAPERBACK VERSION AT BARNES AND NOBLES.
0553381695|4.0|Book two picks up right where Game of Thrones left off--Arya is on the run  with the Night's Watch, Sansa is held captive by child king Joffrey, Robb leads an army against the Lannisters, Bran holds down the fort at home, Jon has gone beyond the wall, Theon has returned home to take his rightful place as heir, Stannis and Renley are gathering their respective armies in order to claim the throne of the Seven Kingdoms for themselves, and Danny prepares her Dothraki forces. The book is as complicated as it sounds. Not that it is a bad thing. Part of the draw for this book is the utterly complex political situation set in the backdrop of a fantastical world where magic exists but is not in abundance (a rarity in fantasy).     One of the things that Martin does best with his characters and stories is the complexity of the story. Right and wrong is not nearly as obvious as other books tend to make it. Sure the Lannisters (minus Tyrion) are pretty awful, but for the most part, everyone has understandable if not honorable motives. In book one we saw Ned Stark struggle with honor and by remaining so rigid he end up losing his life and putting his children in trouble. Was that the right idea or should he have bent, at least a little, until he could better plan? Similar issues are grappled with in this book: Should Robb bend to the Lannisters to save his sisters? Should Theon be more loyal to the Starks who raised him despite being held essentially captive or should he attempt to reclaim his place with his true family? Should you stay aligned to a lord or a family member when you don't believe in the methods they employ?     Arya is still one of my favorites, for her strength and ingenuity. Even Sansa is growing on me, though despite all that's going on she somehow clings to her romantic ideals which gets a little frustrating. It felt like we could have gone deeper into Theon's internal struggle, which is more complex than perhaps any other character's in the book. The one character I really cared nothing for was Davos who seemed like a random character used more for plot device than because we were supposed to connect or care about him in any way.     Though it felt like some of the plot was rushed (dealing with Renly in particular seemed to come and go so quickly it was hardly worth having him involved in the first place), it was generally full of well-paced action. Not quite as many shocks as book one, but still an enjoyable read.
0385342020|5.0|I love this author and make sure to get her books as soon as they come out.  It was just as fantastic as I thought it would.  Also, thank you Amazon for offering affordable books.
0553801473|2.0|I read all five books of GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire in quick succession. I can only say that I was totally disappointed in \\"A Dance With Dragons.\\" After a prologue (which at best was confusing and accomplished nothing) 71 Chapters, and an epilogue the question must be asked: \\"Where's the beef?\\" \\"A Dance With Dragons,\\" really makes me wonder if GRRM's heart is really in this series anymore. Simply put, A dance With Dragons is a one thousand page epic of dull, dragging, incestuously self-referential, clich&eacute;-ridden language, soap-opera style narrative in which nothing significant reaches any kind of conclusion. Also, that I can do without the voyeuristic sex and the explicit detail of bodily functions and parts in endless details about bowel movements, Wildling penis size, peeing, frozen snot and on and on. That type of \\"gritty realism\\" detail detracts from the story for me and is not necessary.<br /><br />The first three books were excellent. Rich in detail and well written. Then came \\"A Feast for Crows.\\" The plot bogged down and did not move forward. Not to worry said I. Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind experience the same issues with The Wheel of Time and The Sword of Truth series before they righted their series ships. Surely GRRM would pay heed to the criticism AFFC received and pick up the plot and move it forward at a much faster pace. Unfortunately, Not only did he not pick it up, he kicked it into the basement and plot movement ground to a virtual stand-still.<br /><br />Jon essentially spends 13 chapters moving the Wildings south of the Wall and worrying about food only to get the Ides of March treatment from four of his Crows. Why spend that much time developing a character only to kill him off. Well maybe now we will at least be rid of Mormonts stupid raven screaming \\"corn, corn, corn,\\" every other sentence. With the death of Jon Snow, GRRM has managed to kill off every character I had any feeling for. Well Catelyn is still around after her rather bazaar resurrection. So is Arya, but I have no clue what she is turning into for the Many-Faced God.<br /><br />Daenerys, Mother of Dragons spends her 10 chapters holed up in the cesspool city of Mereen and dithering with palace intrigues and fighting a guerilla war with the Sons of the Harpy--only she never does any fighting, just takes casualties -- for the whole bloody book, while everything falls apart around her. Well she does have several steamy bath scenes with some of her ladies...HBO ought to love them. Bold, adventurous Dany who I though was on her way to Kings Landing turned into an abusive mother who put her children (the Dragons) in chains and turned into a hand-wringing, indecisive soap opera queen.<br /><br />And that brings me to Tyrion who also got 10 chapters. Our friendly dwarf spends his time making cynical comments to minor characters on a boring journey in which he ends up on a sinking ship with Ser Jora who is taking him to Daenerys. In the next Tyrion chapter the slippery half-pint appears on the slave block in Mereen along with Ser Jora. Ahhh could it be that he will finally be able to ally himself with Daenerys? She could certainly use his help at intrigue. But no, the Dragon queen flits off to never never land on the back of her black dragon leaving us with several chapters of Ser Barristan agonizing over everything and nothing. He does take Daenerys husband, who is also the King of Mereen, captive. To what end we kind of never find out.<br /><br />Unfortunately in GRRM's world, all the good guys die only to be replaced by simpering, directionless, two dimensional, uninteresting characters that are sent on never ending journeys. If anything bad can happen to the good guys, it does. I can also do without the GREAT amount of senseless killing, rape, torture, disease, etc. that seems to dominate all of the books, but especially dominates \\"A Dance With Dragons.<br /><br />But it's not just good guys GRRM kills off. The arch villain Tywin Lannister<br />also gets deep-sixed by Tyrion leaving the plot with no real antagonist of any consequence. Cersei might have filled that role had not GRRM not use her two chapters to debase her into another whiney paranoid soap queen who spends one whole chapter walking naked through Kings Landing. I guess you could make Roose Bolton into an antagonist...he and his bastard psychopathic son Ramsay make a good pair...but other than gratuitous rape, torture and mayhem they are shallow and two dimensional. So who is left? Errrrr....<br /><br />The line up on the Protagonist side is not much better. Daenerys is about the only major player left from Game of Thrones. Well there is Theon Greyjoy...but he has been made over into the unheroic Reek. Then there is Bran who spent his three chapters learning to talk to trees and sliding in and out of the bodies of Ravens, his direwolf and Hodor.<br /><br />So after five books we are left with no clear-cut protagonist or arch antagonist.  As I said earlier I don't think this series will ever be completed. If GRRM does write another book it had better be on a 2-year cycle not a 5-year cycle.<br /><br />In conclusion I don't like \\"A Dance With Dragons.\\" It was not a good read for me. I say this in the face of a large number of reviews and critiques that rave about GRRM's A Song of Fire and Ice series being \\"Adult Fantasy.\\" I can honestly say that I agree with them as the coarse language (how many degrading ways can you say vagina), numerous rape and sex scenes, the obvious pornographic BDSM of the slaver cities certainly earn a XXX rating in my opinion. It is gritty reality at its unbest, but I can already see the HBO execs drooling over it. But to me it is a complete turn-off as was the book itself.ister<br />also gets deep-sixed by Tyrion leaving the plot with no real antagonist of any consequence.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I both loved and hated this book.  I hated what it had to say about the depths of depravity to which humans are capable of sinking; but I loved it's representation of the individual's ability to overcome adversity.<br /><br />This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  It's fast paced, with excellent narration that \\"rings true,\\" even though it is set in a future dystopia.  The world of the Hunger Games is cast as \\"our\\" future, striking a perfect balance between the familiar and the alien.<br /><br />The important characters are well developed, but the reader isn't beaten about the head and shoulders with long, pace-slowing narrative passages.  Ms Collins tells us what we need to know as we go, without resorting to the kinds of tricks lesser authors often use.<br /><br />Peeta, the 16 year old protagonist, grabbed me in the first few pages with her direct, open style of narration.  She isn't a perfect character - she has her flaws - but the way she takes care of her little sister, ultimately offering her own life to save her, is more than just endearing.  The reader falls in love with her.  She is strong, smart, and amazingly capable, able to think like her opponents, but ultimately unable to read others' feelings for her.  This is not a fatal flaw, but it certainly does make her character more interesting!<br /><br />Supporting characters are equally well crafted; each provided just enough back story to make them real enough for the story's purposes, and always from the limited perspective of the teen narrator.  None of the characters is a stereotype, and many of them turn out to be more - or less - than they seem.<br /><br />The Hunger Games defies categorization.  Though it is labeled \\"young adult fiction,\\" it has powerful appeal for older adults.  Typed as \\"science fiction\\" and \\"fantasy,\\" it also fits into the \\"action/adventure\\" genre.  Some have even called it a \\"romance novel,\\" though it would appeal to even the most romance-averse reader.  In short, Ms Collins seems to have created her own category.<br /><br />The author doesn't preach to her audience, but this book has much to teach about the human condition.  I strongly recommend it for teens and adults, but would advise caution with children 12 and younger.  Some of the book's events are brutal and disturbing; possibly too disturbing for some children.  Read the book first, and ask yourself if your child is more like Peeta or Prim.  You will have your answer.eated her own category.

B003L77GRO|1.0|It's a truism that the worse a television series starts to suck, the more loudly it's Fanboys will defend it.  It's no surprise that Season 4 is rated \\"four stars\\": almost everyone with any critical thinking skills stopped watching after season 3, so all that's left are the people who'd rave about how wonderful it is no matter what.    Here's the truth of the matter, though: Season 4 meanders around aimlessly for the entire first half of the season, with almost no focus whatsoever.  When the writers finally get around to trying to establish an arc for the season, they do so in the laziest way imaginable: Dexter randomly notices a stain in the back of a U-Haul that he's renting, and instantly assumes a serial killer murdered someone in it.  Surprise surprise, he's right.  The problem is that it's later shown that the killer never transported the bodies in the U-Haul, and killed his victims via electrocution.    Then there's the endless scenes of Deb accidentally running into Dexter within ten feet of a dead body, and never once cluing in to the idea that maybe it's not a coincidence.  These scenes were there entirely for the \\"next week on Dexter\\" teasers, so they could push the silly \\"Will THIS be the week Deb discovers that Dexter is a killer?\\" red herring.    Now, very few of the other people commenting on this season seem to have a issue with any of this.  But that's the problem with assuming that your audience is comprised entirely of idiots: it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

B004J4WLPU|5.0|I read this book earlier this summer, and I can't stop thinking about it. For me, it was far more than an engrossing and well-written \\"who-done-it.\\"  It was a deeply moving contemplation of loss as well as a profound exploration of the relationship between sisters.  From the title, that might sound pretty obvious, but this book impacted my emotions about my own sister in a way I never anticipated.  \\"Sister\\" has been nothing short of illuminating, and I am grateful to the author for sharing her world.  She has changed mine.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|I love this game. It's really different from anything I've played.  My son took my tablet from me and spent an hour getting to level 4 and loving it.  I'm still working on level 1 but this game looks like a real winner for car trips and long waits anywhere.    I would recommend this game to anyone who like a game that's a little different from anything else.
0316066524|4.0|I must share. This work of genius does not translate as well as, say, the bible to Kindle format. The footnotes within footnotes confuse my clicking finger and, worse, the link *to* footnote works just fine but the reverse, not. You end up on the next page or the next next page. Most frustrating while working through this complex maze of a book. So. Kindle great for Girl with the Iron Fist (what's it called?), but not this. Stick to hardcover. Very satisfying.
B0058A119G|5.0|Barbra Streisand is one of the best singers ever.  Her voice conveys such warmth, wisdom and hope.  She is truly one of a kind. She sings so efforlessly on these tracks.  She pays tribute to the work of Alan and Marilyn Bergman on this two disc set.  I am surprised that I learn that I already know most of these songs.  I especially love the song \\"Solitary Moon\\". Chris Botti lends his talents playing the trumpet on this track.  It sounds very smooth and romantic.<br /><br /> \\"That Face\\" is a song written by Alan Bergman to his wife Marilyn.  This song has a sweet sentiment.  This is largely because of the violin playing here.  The musical arrangements are simply superb  The piano playing  is absolutely lovely.  \\"Nice N Easy\\" has a dreamy romantic tone to it.  I love the harp and piano playing here.<br /><br />  \\"The Way We Were\\",\\"You Don't Bring Me Flowers and \\"How Do You Keep The Music Playing\\" are three songs I grew up listening to.  It is great to listen to  all these tunes in one collection.  I love these three songs very much. \\"A Piece Of The Sky\\" and \\"Papa Can You Hear Me\\" are two beautiful songs from the movie Yentl.  These songs are very uplifting and moving.  Barbra can sing sad songs so well.  \\"The Windmills Of Your Mind\\" is a sad song that she sings perfectly.  \\"So Many Stars\\" is a pretty song.  It has a hopeful quality that lifts my spirit.  I love this music.
B003BWERF8|2.0|Let me start by saying this. I am not an average user. I am an engineer so I didn't just plug it in and gave up once it didn't connect. I have tried to get this product to work with my Ipod Classic 80GB and my Jambox. It wouldn't connect. You could hear the \\"connect\\" sound but it wouldn't stream music via i10S transmitter. I had tried all possible solutions but nothing worked. See other reviews by users who have an Ipod Classic also. They also experienced the same problems with i10s transmitter.    Please be warned.

B002ZG975Q|5.0|This was a really fun movie. The actors are great and the story is really fun and is very uplifting. I really liked the tattoo magic it was cool. Very funny.
159448385X|4.0|I can't say I ever truly had any intention in reading this despite the fact that I really enjoyed The Kite Runner. I don't typically like reading realistic modern fiction because I find it depressing no matter how wonderful the story. However I found out that my mom had ordered it months ago and never touched it, so I took it and finally read it myself. Despite the depressing nature of the book I did really enjoy it and it managed to reach me in a way that most novels don't.<br /><br />Khaled uses the same technique he used in The Kite Runner so the `feel' is the same, the writing remains as wonderful and flowing as it was in his previous book as well. Also like the Kite Runner there is a deep underlying sadness to the plot that you simply can't help but feel as you read through it. The two main characters, Mariam and Laila, are wonderful and in their own ways strong. Mariam's story was one that I found extremely sad as it progressed, but I found Khalid's ability to capture how she was feeling perfect. There are the small things that she does that really connect her to you and you realize that even though you've probably never been in the same situation that you've felt that same frustration or that same hope. Laila's story isn't a happy one either but it brings in the hope for a better life. The relationship between these two was very realistic and believable. They didn't immediately rush to support one another but they also didn't remain utterly stone faced about the other either. This was really a heartbreaking book but it's also one that's a true eye opener to the cruelty that lies in other places.<br /><br />This book really provokes emotions and pulled me into the story, to the point where I read it in two days and nearly cried numerous times. To me this is a book worth reading, it is by no means a light read and it will probably cause you to think and feel for the people who have really gone through situations such as these. It does contain abuse in multiple ways so if you don't want to read about such things this isn't for you, this is by no means an easy read. I really enjoy Khaled's writing and if he has written anything else I plan to find it and if not I'll be on the look out for if he does again.on't want to read about such things this isn't for you, this is by no means an easy read. I really enjoy Khaled's writing and if he has written anything else I plan to find it and if not I'll be on the look out for if he does again.

B000OT6V00|5.0|This movie has many subtle points that might evade the viewer.  For example Jeffrey Tabor's boss man, like Ron Perlman's Hellboy, is always smoking a cigar.  It is not until close to the end of the movie that the two develop some regard for the other, after having to work closely together in dangerous circumstances.  It is the short exchange between the two on the subject of cigars that indicates that they have finally come to understand one another somewhat.  Tabor's character shows Hellboy that he should light his cigar with a wooden match \\"to preserve the flavor\\".  In reply Hellboy actually says \\"thanks\\"!
B004LWZVZC|1.0|This movie is not historically accurate, so many lies as to what really happened.There are a few  good books that have been written in regard to Mary Surratt and the military commission fairness in her treatment.Five members of the military commission did ask for life imprisonment instead of hanging her  but that was denied but then president Andrew Johnson.It would have been justice to actually focus on the 8 conspirators and their role in the death of Abraham Lincoln but instead had to make a political point in today's military tribunals.Read the book Assassination of Lincoln:A History of the Great Conspiracy by T.M.Harris,The Assassination of President Lincoln and the trial of the conspirators by Benn Pittman.The movie the conspirator was total waste of time but mention extremely boring.
0553801473|2.0|I have spent over 5 years telling myself \\"don't worry, a Dance with Dragons will completely and utterly make up for Feast for Crows\\".  Um, not so much.  More characters introduced, more plodding and indecision, and it is finally 100% clear to me that GRRM just doesn't give a rats ass about finishing this series in a timely or motivated manner.  He has lost the love for the characters, the story, everything, and if you do not see this, you are blind.  Yeah, I gave it 2 stars because the first 3 books are so damned good that at least he had to have some good characterization that comes through into these last two sub-par books.  Tyrion is the wittiest, most fun character and yet he is so underutilized in this book that it borders on criminal.  I gotta hand it to GRRM though, he is on top of his game when it comes to describing the food they eat in the story.  I realize this is somewhat scathing, but this was a long time to wait for disappointment.
0553801473|1.0|Martin hates his readers almost as much as his characters.  The series is become very Robert Jordan-ish and is a serious test of patience. The plot inches forward, but Martin's writer's block is still evident, though not as bad as \\"Feast.\\"  I give it one star due to the wait, expectations, and my frustration at seeing a great series sputter and die.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This has always been one of my all time favorite movies, even now that I'm in my 20s. I can quote the whole movie to you line for line if asked and I even know the scenes by heart. So it goes without saying that I own this dvd and that I practically covet it. It looks just a wonderful as it did on VHS(probably more so I suppose) and even though I'm not fond of the 'Morning report' song that they had cut from the original release I find myself singing it all the time. If you are a Disney fan or just love the Lion King this is worth the extra money to own.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|I pre-ordered this movie after I saw it in the theaters and loved it.  I've had the movie for two weeks and still watch it every night.  If you are a fan of Danny McBride, or EastBound and Down, you will love this movie. I've never shown it to anyone without them wanting to steal it.  Not for the faint of heart.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|Free will and determinism are the themes explored in \\"The Adjustment Bureau.\\"  David Norris (Matt Damon) loses his Senate race in New York, but on Election Night he meets Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) and is soon swept off his feet.  The mysterious members of the Adjustment Bureau, however, make it known to David that his nascent romance is not in his best interest, but David resists what he sees not as their advice, but their meddling.<br /><br />As the film progresses, it invites the viewer to ask questions and form their own opinion about whether the protagonists make the right choices concerning their destiny and whether free will is a good thing--different viewers will likely come to different conclusions about the choices made.<br /><br />\\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" is not flawless--there is some silly commentary on the part of the head of the Adjustment Bureau on the history of humanity, and the ending is not necessarily what one would expect from a movie that examines free will and determinism.  I thought that the movie was a bit odd when I first saw it at the theater, but it is well acted, its cinematography of New York City is great, and it is worth your time--the film is one of those movies that gets much better with a second viewing.

B0013LL2Z2|2.0|This dystopian 1976 sci-fi clunker looks like it was filmed in a deserted shopping mall or office center, replete with fake greenery and piped in lifeless voices. Exteriors were obviously off the lot somewhere in southern California. The obviously fake model bubble city reminded me of Disney's Epcot. The acting is embarrassingly bad, and the script, well, it's also a message movie for its times when being over 30 was supposed to be like death. The special effects, such as they are, are cheap beyond words. Yet somehow this relic has remained as some sort of pop cultural icon. Watch it for its unintentional laughs. It's quite campy.
B005BGBPBG|3.0|Okay so I read the reviews before I actually watched the movie so I knew what I was walking into. But its a movie people stop judging it like its a live show or something. Many movies have cliches or are predictable whether its action or romance. But if you try to enjoy the movie you will. Its cute and its a love story that anyone should want to see over and over again. It wasnt the best but it wasnt the worst either.
B00479SVBU|4.0|This is a very good device transferring USB flash drive and SD card files to your FM radio. excellent design, crystal clear sound (just pick the right FM frequency). The only Con is that it only recognized English menu and listings, if they can improve the product by accepting multi languages, I will give them a perfect 5-Star. Worth every penny I spent.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I love Jane Eyre! I have the novel, the parody Jane Slayer, and several versions of the movie.  This is by far my favorite of the movies.  I thought it was going to be more indy and edgy but it turned out to be a very convincing portrait of what Jane's life must have really been like.  It is such a true representation of the book that after the movie was over I could think of nothing important that they had left out or skimmed over.  It is such a smart movie with a heroine that proves witty and self restrained all at once.  The casting is perfect and the pace is neither rushed nor does it drag along like many other period movies.  Though the bleak grey landscape of the movie does not reveal it, this is a story of all consuming passion.  Instead of the premise of other romances where the woman is swept away and saved my her hero,  this book has a heroine who saves herself time and time again.  Self-reliance and determination give Jane the ability to realize what she wants and wait until the time is right to claim it.  I would recommend this movie to any romantic whether male or female.

B0058OUJA4|5.0|(First paragraph is a rant to the idiots, last one is actual thoughts of the game)  #1 if youre gonna download a TD game when you hate TD games &amp; then give it a low rating for being a TD game you should go play in the traffic #2 people who complain about it being like another game are retarded &amp; obviously dont realize that everything in this world is a copy of something else. You can get a Samsung Tablet next to an iPad &amp; ask a 70yr old whats the difference &amp; he&apos;ll say its exactly the same other than few minor details, making something better than what it was is what keeps the world turning, so shut up about it being a copy.  ANYWAYS The game is awesome if you want a TD game that is harder than the rest out there &amp; youre willing to get it for free or pay the extra $2 then do it, &amp; if it does get too hard you can always get the change the difficulty or make it harder. I had to change my GamePlan in mid game &amp; i had a blast doing it cuz everything had to be done before that last life went away(almost passed it too, but they were too much for me too handle the next game however ended differently)
B0036EH3XE|1.0|The bottom line is that LOST was absolutely brilliant in Season 1, and then it just steadily went downhill from there. The final season was utterly dreadful, and it was a complete waste of time for the audience. The writers insisted that they wouldn't use some purgatory-type explanation for the show, and yet in the final season they give us one reality that is essentially just a type of purgatory. The writers failed to come up with intelligent explanations for much of what happened in the series, and their lack of long-term vision became more and more apparent as the series progressed.<br /><br />Celebrity-worship also plagued this show, in that the creators would bring in certain actors (e.g. the always-annoying guy who played Ben), and then they couldn't kill him off because he was designated to be one of the stars from that point onward. This is despite the fact that much of the show's audience seemed to want him killed off as soon as possible. Instead of getting rid of him (as well as that phony and boring Juliet character), they kept him on until the end. Yawn.<br /><br />Also, the most talented writer for the show, David Fury, left after season 1. That explains a lot.
B000VUQ4HW|2.0|Have seen this movie with the haunting,eery piano soundtrack that made this masterpiece truly scary. The sound track on this flick is a bore/tedium and takes away the frightening element with added sounds that are just plain stupid. The music in most part is lousy. Orlock/Nosferato is a horror story not some kind of sick joke.    Bring me the pounding on the piano any time.    The 3D is remarkably good for a century old film. But they knew about 3D way back then.    Tromeo studios is truly pathetic. They are not campy. They have no talent whatsoever except for one middle aged actor who is polished among the most polished in the field. He takes a role, I assume when he flat broke.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I was obsessed with this movie for about a year during my 21-22 years of life. Rarely is so much emotion and passion caught in one place. But this does it. Discussions of God, loneliness, time travel, insanity, destiny, fate, love, hate, fear, meaning, purpose, death, life.. It's all here. In one of the most mysterious movies ever created.

0307712354|1.0|I just couldn't finishing it... Completely disappointing! I actually listed to the audio book during a vacation, but at one point it was just too annoying and I had to stop. Horrible dialogues and totally unrealistic actions/reactions/characters. None of the characters really fully develops.     Also, I find the translation really odd at times.     Don't waste your time!

B004UA8D1O|3.0|This movie is best viewed start to finish. I could not do that with my new 3D LG 1080p, plasma with shutter glasses from amazon.com. The glasses kept on dying in about ten minutes because I was viewing out of the short range of about 7 feet of the shutter glasses.The 3D effects are good with the shutter glasses. They are better than the passive 3D glasses I have with my new LED 1080p 3D TV from amazon.com.    This was a movie made for 3D presentation. I think that this was Sanctum's only reason for release.    All movies are cool if they are in 3D. The 3D TVs and 3D Blu-ray players have better 3D than the cheap, colored, cellulose film paper glasses.    The film is 2 stars with 3D the true star of the flick (kinda redundant).    Amazon is far cheaper on the new 3D TV sets than everyone else for the time being. Just thought I would throw that in (preposition). Shutter glasses, from what I have seen are sharper than the passive 3D glasses like in the cinema. With LG LED 3D TVs you can use Real3D glasses from the theater on your 3D TV.    I do not work for amazon.com. I do not know anyone who works for amazon.com.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I am a huge HP fan.  I have all the first edition books and the dvds.  I was so excited when this movie came out but sad also as this one is the beginning of the end of the series.  How sad!  I think the producers were correct in making 2 movies out of the final book in order to get the detail and to keep the storyline intact.  The effects were good and the acting much better than years past.  I think for anyone who has not read the final book they might have some problems understanding what certain wands mean or who certain people are, but in general it was easy to follow.  It will be interesting to see how the final movie comes together at the end. Exactly how graphic will it be?  What will the director and writers choose to focus on?  Stay tuned for the final answers!
B005IEWT0M|5.0|...Walter White's decisions get worse and worse.<br /><br />This season seems to be about questions.  This episode leaves us questioning the future of everyone and every situation in the series.<br /><br />Walt has spiraled down to a point where it is hard to believe he can ever dig himself, much less anyone else out of the muck he has created.  Jesse, on the other hand, is proving he has skills and worth to Gus, who makes Donald Trump look like the manager of a hot dog stand...and then there is Hank, not making an appearance in this episode, but no doubt, much recovered and re-energized in the next...<br /><br />I now have at least twelve scenarios in my little mind, swimming around as I speculate on the end of this season, although it is only half over, and possibly the series...even though I want it to go on forever.<br /><br />I have one question for the next episode: Walter Jr is out cruising around the block in his birthday-mobile, but is that situation too simple?  Remember, this series takes us back and by surprise over and over...  Has anyone else noticed that while babies can be replaced by look-alikes, and adults age little over four seasons which represent a much shorter time-span in the series, a teenager who was fourteen or fifteen when the series started has a hard time looking like he is coming up on sixteen for someone born in 1993...just saying...Walt's bad decisions seem to have ever-worsening consequences...remember the driving lesson where Walter Jr had a hard time using one foot on the brake and one foot on the gas?  We just saw Walt spazz and drop a drum of toxic chemicals in \\"Shotgun.\\"  Maybe like father, like son?

B0054NQZ9S|5.0|This film is very well-researched and well-written. The topic is so close to home because I was laid off right at the very start of the Great Recession. Starting from the dialogue of the HR person giving the pink slip, to the outplacement agency, the retrenchment package (1 week's worth of salary for every year of service), the initial false certainty that we'd find a job after only a few days or weeks or even just after 3 months, the emotional paralysis, etc.     Turns out the story was developed after interviewing almost 200 people who were laid off. So the story is so realistic. It is not just a story but it is my story and the story of millions of people, millions of families of the current times.

B003062NG0|4.0|Porcupine Tree has set a standard that few, if any, can reach it seems. As I expected, \\"Recordings\\" did not disappoint. This is classic greatness ahead of it's time. I love P.T.'s various works because of the passionate vocal dynamic and musical mastery P.T. brings with every effort, every album. \\"Recordings\\" is as dark ,lyrically, as anything they've done I imagine. And being a naturally optimistist guy, always seeing the light at the end of the blackness, this is something I have to reckon with with each and every Porcupine Tree album I own. However, the outstanding musicianship, incredible heartfelt vocal delivery, and colorfully vivid pictures drawn by the lyrics, make it quite easy to soak in....I, for one, MUST have a daily dose of Porcupine Tree or my day is incomplete. I generally listen to at least 2-3 albums a day. I know, I've got issues, but music at this level is hard to find. All I can say is P.T. and their \\"Recordings\\" album is worthwhile listening for anyone who appreciates great music and/or outstanding Progressive music. It's not Dead Wing, but I still give it 4 out of 5 stars. If you enjoyed the Stupid Dream album you'll probably really enjoy this work as well.

0061353248|5.0|I am a veteran game designer and currently working on some social games. These are the free-to-play games with micro-transactions and the like. This book is worth the price for the sections on Relative Choices and The Power of Free alone. It has me thinking in a totally different way.<br /><br />Mike Birkhead wrote a very good post on how some of the books theories can be applied to game design on altdevblogaday.com which you can read directly here: [...]<br />But there are a number of other very interesting and entertaining sections. I participial liked the bit on Market vs. Social Norms. I just realized how boring that sounds, but I assure you it isn't. The first example from the book where a daycare center starting charging a fee to parents who picked up their kids late. The result was that it increased the number of late pick-ups and the theory offers a very good explanation as to why.<br /><br />BTW I picked up the Audio version from the Amazon owned Audible.com and had no problem with the reader or the quality. There are PDF's available on Audible containing the few pages of charts and graphs but you won't really need them.

This episodes shows the ever more egotistical side of walter white aka heisenberg. Hes the big man running the shop and he lets everyone know about it in this episode especially skylar.    As walter white he was kind, generous, smart and a bit of a pushover but as heisenberg he is letting his ego get the best of him and is now being careless and stupid with his actions.    Buying your son a 40 thousand dollar charger when your supposed to be broke not smart. Bringing three female Mexican workers into the lab to help clean up with cameras for gus to see not smart.    and where was jesse during this, on a steakout with his new buddy mike to get back their meth and how jesse gets access to the house to get it is just another brilliant showing of the attention to detail vince puts in this show.

0316098329|4.0|I have approached this book with trepidation due to some early reviews, and the whole idea of child abuse and such. I found the book to be very good at holding my attention, and a quick read. It gave an interesting perspective on how a child born in a situation of abduction and imprisonment regards world and life, and his problems adjusting to 'normal' life. Though a horrifying tale in many aspects, it is writen is such way that the horror is secondary to the acceptance shown through the eyes of a child. I was a little dissapointed by the rather trite and flat ending, but overall, a very enjoyable read.

030788743X|5.0|Ready Player One, a dystopian fiction set in 2044 and Ernest Cline's first novel, is quickly becoming known for this memorable one-word review, from author John Scalzi: \\"Nerdgasm.\\" Cline pushes our nerdgasm to its limits, stuffing the narrative full of every 1980s reference readers may know and then some more. Lucky for us, Cline's novel consists of more than nerdy references; it is also a thrilling tale of escapism and obsession, penned by a very talented, and often very funny, storyteller.<br /><br />In Cline's 2044, all of humanity's fears have come true; we have killed the earth, leaving behind a depleted husk with few natural resources, global hunger, and little hope. In Cline's \\"stacks,\\" which are trailer parks grown upward, teetering towers of poverty, we find Wade Watts, our allieratively-named, mega-nerd hero. An orphan, Wade wanders between his aunt's trailer and his Fortress of Solitude, the back of an abandoned van, spending most of his waking hours plugged into the OASIS.<br /><br />Five years before the novel's beginning, James Halliday, legendary video game creator, died. Halliday began creating videogames in the 1980s, and he remembered that decade like the legendary Troy. For him, everything good came from the '80s, all of the best music, movies, and games. Except for one game. The OASIS, Halliday and his team's last creation, is an acronym for Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation. Immersive virtual reality, a topic Cline handles so lightly and easily that it's difficult to believe he is not speaking from experience. In 2044, the OASIS is no longer a game: it is life. The fact that the earth's problems continue to grow while most of the population sits motionless, living in the OASIS, lies beneath Cline's narrative, a subtle warning.<br /><br />Halliday, heirless, leaves behind one final game: a virtual Easter Egg in the OASIS (like a secret message hidden in the game's coding). The first person to find the Egg, to complete the game-within-a-game, wins his fortune. For five years, the Egg Hunters, or gunters, swarm the OASIS but cannot unscramble Halliday's first riddle. Wade, now in his last year of virtual high school, is smarter than all of the other gunters, natch. The competition has quieted over five years, but no one has stopped researching Halliday's obsessions, re-watching WarGames, listening to Rush albums, playing every classic video game to perfect scores.<br /><br />Cline recounts the story of the the Hunt's real beginning as Wade, his virtual best friend, his virtual crush, millions of other gunters, and an evil company seeking control of the OASIS--and, in effect, the world--compete to find the Egg, to solve the next riddle, to unlock the next level.<br /><br />Cline simultaneously excites readers for the future--the OASIS, after all, sounds pretty awesome--and cautions us not to lose touch with the real, the tactile, world. It's a delicate balance. The story could easily have veered too cautionary, but Cline's undeniable enthusiasm for the future of gaming reins in the warning, reminding readers that real friends can be made online, real adventures had. Wade's immersion in the OASIS means he lives his life a little like a game, a little recklessly and over-the-top, and treats the game like life, with earnestness and devotion. Cline's novel beautifully balances the two worlds and suggests that happiness lies in neither world but somewhere between--a harmony of the real and the ideal.wins his fortune.

0307946711|2.0|The book is different and fresh, each chapter indicating one year. I love Emma Morley, although her character can be quite annoying; I would yell at the book when Emma would make smart remark. Dexter Mayhew is a character too! I found myself really disappointed in him, when he wasn't around Emma. I loved the tension between them throughout the 15 years of friendship, before they decided to give it a go.     I will the say that towards the end of the book is what threw me off. I didn't like it and read as fast as I could, to reach the end. It was kind of ironic how Dex would date Maddy, but it made me more upset. Her death came way too fast, just when they were settling down and were finally together. That really bugged me and it made no sense to do that.     I understand that a lot of authors are straying away from \\"don't give the readers what they want\\" crap, but seriously. For most of the chapters they weren't together! They were just really close friends that always thought about one another. And when they finally get married and are on the way to a happy life, she dies? and they were only married for what 2 years? I couldn't believe it. It was bad enough he was already married once and had a kid with someone else. And Em and Dex couldn't have a baby; when she was meant to be the mother of his child?     Overall the book is well written, great details and nice way of leaving us wondering what happened on the other days, besides every 15th of July. But it kind of fails to give hope to people that wonder if that boy/girl they really like is the one they'll end up with? Maybe I'm just mad because they didn't spend the rest of their lives together, but this book sure works you up to believe that. And honestly after everything they've been through, they deserved to be happy and live out the rest of their lives together!
0756405890|3.0|The book was good, though I skipped over alot of the Denna parts, which bored me.  Kvothe seems a little too know-it-all and at times I thought of him as a pompous ass.  I also got a bit bored with the First Person telling, which I usually don't have a problem with.  Having said that, I liked the rest of the writing style and will probably move on to the next book...where I hope Denna perishes and Bast is more detailed.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I started reading this book for the same reason millions of other people did. Someone let me borrow The Hunger Games and after reading that I was hooked. I read Catching Fire and finished Mockingjay last night, and was sort of satisfied with the ending. I didn't like the fact that the author really didn't develop Katniss's character as well as she could have. Katniss remained a bratty and brave teenager for most if not the entire book. Everyone around her matured and grew, but she remained stagnant and stubborn. Luckily, all the other main characters' developments and story lines were way more interesting. The book was really graphic and gory for several chapters, but I think it was the author's way of making her point. War is never a noble endeavor. The innocent always suffer the most, and even after a war is \\"won\\", there is not a single person that participated that does not have the blood of the innocent on their hands. I really enjoyed the social commentary aspect of the book. I think it's a great read for teenagers today who have NO idea how good they have it. As for the romantic entanglements, Collins wrapped that up a little too neatly, but I guess she didn't want to go on for 500 pages explaining how Peeta finally worked through his \\"hijacking\\" and how Katniss finally realized how lucky she was to have him. Peeta's development was tough to read, because for many (myself included) Peeta was my favorite character. All in all, a great book for teenagers. I hope that the trilogy eventually becomes mandatory reading for HS kids or that parents with teenagers strongly suggest it to their kids. I was thoroughly entertained by the trilogy, but really glad that it's over.

B0058OUJA4|3.0|Force Close every time on start up on LG Optimus V running AOSP's Cyanogen mod (GINGERBREAD).<br /><br />Before some troll makes an ignorant comment about this phone being cheap and/ or old, just know this phone is neither.<br /><br />When this app gets updated to work properly, I will adjust my rating accordingly.<br /><br />[UPDATE] I just learned that the game uses the OpenFeint spyware to send your email address out.  My phone blocks communications to OpenFeint's servers, which is probably why the game fails.  If the developer was correct that OpenFeint was not an integrated part of the game, the OpenFeint part would fail and the game would start.  That isn't the case if indeed the FC is the fault of OpenFeint's spyware components.
B002WY65W4|5.0|I think this movie is great from beginning to end. Sure there are some predictable parts, some corny parts, but it's a comedy about zombies.

B0058A119G|5.0|Barbra Streisand has (I believe) an egalitarian spirit! I'm assuming she made sure that her latest CD -- celebrating her \\"lyricist, best-of-friends\\" The Bergmans -- went on sale EVERYWHERE, as promised, this day, August 23:  Same day it became available here at the `world's biggest website,' I went out and bought my copy on my lunch hour (on this \\"the hottest day of the year\\" in what is usually \\"the world's coldest major city.\\"  An aside: Barbra performed here in Winnipeg back in the 1960s, then not again in Canada for another 40 years! Long story, not very interesting).<br /><br />First a confession: While I've not been Barbra's biggest fan throughout those 40 years, I've  gradually been won-over by \\"commercial-free\\" satellite radio where, (in keeping with their slogan, \\"Good Music Has a Home\\") Channel 71 plays a song by Barbra Streisand every one-or-two hours;  just minutes ago, for instance, it was Barbra's exquisite version of a song Sinatra effectively \\"retired\\" -- IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING: and like most of the Streisand songs we hear each day on `SiriuslySinatra,' this one featured a huge orchestra, beautifully-arranged by Patrick Williams (who arranged two of the songs here: \\"That Face,\\" and \\"Nice & Easy\\" - the latter featuring a gorgeous trumpet solo by Chris Botti).<br /><br />So. Minutes after buying my copy of the special edition (2-CD set) I sat in my car (windows up, air conditioner going full-blast) listening to the title track (the real reason I was compelled to obtain Ms Streisand's heartfelt tribute to her friends.  As a life-long fan of \\"The Bergmans\\" I'd been delighted, just recently, to hear for the first time the words they composed to this tune by pianist/composer/arranger Dave Grusin:  It's a song so obscure that (according to the liner notes) the copyright remains attributed to \\"Metro Goldwyn Mayer Inc\\" with \\"rights assigned to Ole Movie Classic [films].\\"<br /><br />A week ago I heard Jack Jones first sing these words, on the drive in to work (copied down, thanks to satellite radio's `record' function, and a few red lights!) I've since committed them to memory. For life-long cynics (like me) the words alone on the printed page may appear sentimental.  But then you hear Ms Streisand bring out their timeless beauty, singing this overlooked gem of a song, the way it was meant to be sung: performed with a good sized stringed orchestra, arranged by \\"William A. Ross\\" whose musical bridge features the wistful, `beckoning' sound of French horns: my favorite 'timbre & tone' (the closest to the male singing voice among the brass instruments, I believe).<br /><br />Barbra Streisand was inspired to make WHAT MATTERS MOST the title track. Still seemingly at her vocal peak (how does she do it?) the singer brings an exquisite dignity to the gentle loving words by  Marilyn & Alan Bergman, perfectly mated as they are to an achingly beautiful melody - my favorite, actually - by Dave Grusin.<br /><br />----<br /><br />It's not how long we held each other's hand.<br />What matters is how well we loved each other.<br />It's not how far we traveled on our way,<br />but what we had to say.<br />It's not the Springs we've seen,<br />but all the shades of green.<br /><br />It's not how long I held you in my arms,<br />What matters is how sweet the years together.<br />It's not how many Summer times we had<br />To give to Fall . . .<br />The early morning smiles we wistfully recall<br />[the laughter and the tears we gratefully recall]<br />What matters most, is that we['re] loved at all.<br /><br />----<br /><br />\\"This album,\\" says the title page, \\"is dedicated to the director of THE WAY WE WERE, our dear friend Sidney Pollack.

B002ZG99N6|5.0|I went into this movie not expecting much and left the theater with total amazement. They should change the writing on Ben Affleck's Oscar award from best screenplay for Good Will Hunting to jack of all trades for this movie because this is his best work by far. For him to star in this movie, write this movie, and direct this movie is very impressive. This movie is very well written and Ben Affleck has put himself in the discussion along with Clint Eastwood for best lead actor to direct a movie. Affleck does a terrific job playing Doug MacRay, the leader of a Charlestown bank robbing crew. He's also a conflicted man with his feelings for a female bank manager named Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), his loyalty to his best friend and fellow crew member Gem (Jeremy Renner), and wanting to get out of the game for good while dealing with his menacing boss Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite). And Doug also has relentless FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) pursuing him along with the fact his father (Chris Cooper) is incarcerated for life. Doug handles everything well and has a lot going for him, yet he has all these problems to deal with. Affleck executes those aspects of his role to perfection. The rest of the performances are superb as well. Rebecca Hall as Claire, Doug's one source of redemption, brings a lot of emotion to her role. Jon Hamm brings a lot of intensity as FBI Agent Adam Frawley. Jeremy Renner is also intense as Gem, Doug's best friend and fellow crew member. Chris Cooper makes the most of his cameo appearance as Stephen MacRay, Doug's incarcerated father. Pete Postlethwaite is down right intimidating as Fergie. And another standout performance is Blake Lively as Krista, Doug's drug addicted ex-girlfriend and Gem's sister. Lively breaks out of The Gossip Girl routine to show something different and her performance is on par with everyone else's. This movie is a character driven movie and it does a great job of mixing the action in. There are few action scenes, but they blend in well with the plot, they are timely, and well executed. If not for this movie, then \\"I'm Not Afraid\\" by Eminem would be not in my iPod right now. For those of you who don't know, that song played in the previews for this movie. And that song was perfect for the previews simply because of the intensity of this movie. All in all, Ben Affleck's career performance and a must see for all Ben Affleck fans. I have a variation of one of the lines from this movie: this movie is on this side of the star system and not the other!
1609419693|5.0|This is one of those books that I am POSITIVE it is infinitely better on audio simply because Fey narrates it herself. She takes us through all facets of her life from childhood to motherhood and all of the places in between. She gives us a glimpse of what its like to be female in a profession that is still largely dominated by men. Listening to her tell this story it is easy to see why she is as successful and as adored as she is.    Tina Fey's Bossypants (the audio version) is a memoir that is not to be missed.  I know it is one that I would enjoy listening to again. It is perfect for those days when you just want to laugh. I promise, you will!
B000002JEV|4.0|Just a short review...<br /><br />Led Zeppelin - BBC Sessions (1997) is a fine collection of live recordings from the early days of Zeppelin's career.  Zeppelin's roots are mainly hard rock and blues, and this album reflects that.  Several songs appear multiple times - \\"You Shook Me\\" (twice), \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" (twice), \\"Communication Breakdown\\" (three times), \\"Dazed And Confused\\" (twice), and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" (twice).  The songs have a very raw sound to them, which I like.  There a quite a few blues covers.  If you don't have this set but you have all of Zeppelin's other material and are looking for something \\"new\\" and \\"fresh\\", I recommend this set.  This two-CD set will satisfy your need for some raw, live Zeppelin.<br /><br />I rate this set 4 stars due to the repeats of some songs, but overall it's a great collection.  I highly recommend it.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|This movie is freaking amazing. I found myself smiling constantly, and giggling like no man ever should. Secret Garden also has so many important things to say about relationships and life itself without being too obvious about it. Add to that the fact that the acting is absolutely flawless; I mean everyone is so enjoyable to watch and I felt taken in by the story so much because it felt like I was watching people not actors.
B002ZCY7QY|4.0|The BluRay has the worst picture quality I have ever seen on a DVD much less a BluRay! They added some horrible artificial film grain to the digital footage and it makes it look worst than if you recorded it off a SD tv. It hurts watching it. Great show though...

1563899426|4.0|In the center of New York City, a strange community lives in secrecy, hiding their true natures so that they can exist side-by-side with ordinary humans. These are the Fables, refugees from other realms -- who happen to be the stuff of our world's fairy tales and legends. They've been driven out of their homelands by someone known, at the moment, only as the Adversary; his troops, from what we see in flashbacks, consist of gruesome monsters, goblins, orcs, etc -- the nastiest of the nasty, rapers and raiders, fixed on destruction. They took over territories one by one, and over a period of a couple of hundred years, the Fables fled, first finding their way into other realms, then finally into our world. Most of them live in an luxury apartment building, with their businesses on the surrounding street. Those who can't pass for human (the Three Little Pigs, for instance) live upstate at the Farm. The nice and the naughty live side-by-side thanks to the Amnesty -- an agreement that any Fable seeking asylum both forgive and be forgiven for any past crimes, on the condition that they go forth and sin no more, so that wicked stepmothers, vile sorcerers, and the like, now reformed, can live peaceably with their former victims.<br /><br />The first installment focuses on Snow White and Bigby (the Big Bad Wolf given human form) as they investigate the apparent murder of Snow's wild-child baby sister, Rose Red (this series merges the two Snow Whites, she of the seven dwarves and she of the bear). Along the way, they introduce us to some of Fabletown's greatest heroes and villains: Jack (of Beanstalk fame), Beauty and the Beast (whose curse reverts when his wife gets mad at him), the Frog Prince, Pinocchio, the thrice-divorced Prince Charming (Snow was his first wife, followed by Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella), the formerly-murderous Bluebeard, Little Boy Blue. The interpretations of the characters, bringing them into our modern world, are all quite clever, and sometimes surprising. Prince Charming is pretty much a professional playboy, mooching off of the women he sweeps off their feet (we learn that he's recently worn out his welcome in some of the royal courts in Europe). Snow is the Deputy Mayor of Fabletown, the brains and sweat keeping the whole organization running, while Mayor King Cole gladhands and takes care of the feel-good publicity. Beauty works in a bookshop. The Frog Prince is Fabletown's janitor. Cinderella's profession is as-yet unspecified, but we see her looking pretty badass, taking fencing lessons from Bluebeard.<br /><br />Bigby reveals the details of Rose's disappearance at the Remembrance Day ceremony, a Fabletown holiday on which they gather to honour those who fell defending the Homelands, to reminisce about their lost pasts, and to pledge themselves to, someday, reclaiming their former dominions. It's a nostalgia-fest, and some members of Fabletown are more cynical than others, but it's also the one time when pretty much all the Fables come together -- making it the perfect opportunity for a tell-all. There's some nice detective work going on, but that's far from the focus or importance of the story -- what's far more crucial is what the chain of deceptions and revelations tells us about the characters involved and their relationships.<br /><br />This is a great series, and the first installment does a good job of setting up the primary characters, as well as the world in which they operate. One of the loveliest moments is at the Remembrance Day ceremony. The official toast is the narration for a series of flashbacks -- the first we see of the Adversary's war and the Fables' flight out of the Homelands. It shows the struggles to escape -- in a somewhat different art style, with more saturated colors, higher contrast, more, well, epic tableaux than the usual style. For everything these first few issues reveal about the characters, they tantalizingly hint at a dozen more secrets and yet-unrevealed backstories.It invests the series with a narrative richness that I find utterly captivating -- I love the complexity of it, the threads of story stretching backwards, forwards, and sideways. I love the spaces between, the stories left untold, the character nuances that hint at past tragedies, scarred-over but never-forgotten.th a narrative richness that I find utterly captivating -- I love the complexity of it, the threads of story stretching backwards, forwards, and sideways.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|My roommate ordered this dvd set and made the mistake of purchasing from a secondary seller, which I almost never do, and certainly not for dvds.  It appeared NIB when it arrived, but several of the discs would not play all of the episodes correctly.  Hard to say if it was a scam refurb, or just an unlucky manufacturing anomaly.  I don't remember who the seller was, but I returned it and eventually got the money back, although it took a few weeks.  However, Amazon was helpful with the return process.  They did more than just tell me to contact the seller.  I reordered from Amazon and got a good set and have loved it.  I watched this season when it aired and really enjoyed seeing it again.  I loved the outtakes and extra scenes, and will watch it several more times.  I highly recommend the show, just make sure you order directly from Amazon because the secondary sellers will often send you returned and refurbished items without telling you so.

B0058OUJA4|2.0|I want to like this game,  but it goes out of its way to make itself uninteresting.   The graphics are okay,  the sound is okay,  but there isn&apos;t a single thing that makes this game shine.  There are also misspelled words and typos in a game that for all intents and purposes is supposed to be professionally made.   Not impressed.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|Great CD! It is the best remastering so far of Robert Johnson's great Blues music. I am simply blown away by this CD. It is so good that I am starting to wonder if the people who remastered it didn't also \\"sell their soul\\" to the Devil to be this skillful in the studio. Only kidding. They really got it right this time. But, this is a very good edition of these timeless recordings. I can't stop listening to it. Highly recommended.
0316056863|5.0|This is a great book!!!  I almost never buy books (I prefer the free aspect of the library), but I love Tina Fey and had to have it right away.  It was well worth the cheap Amazon price, and I've loaned it to several people.  From beginning to end this book is hilarious.  It's a page-turner and offers some insight into some of the experiences that have impacted Tina Fey and led her to the  success she has had.  It also makes some important points for women, but never takes itself too seriously.  Thankfully it is also very well-written; it doesn't have the same fake/impersonal ghost writer feel that plagues most books written by \\"celebrities.\\"  This should come as no surprise, as Tina Fey writes for a living and is an incredibly intelligent and articulate person.  It actually feels like she wanted to write this book, rather than it just being a quick way to make some extra cash.  I don't know of anyone I wouldn't recommend this book to, but certainly women of all ages should read it.  It's great to read something from the perspective of a funny, intelligent, independent, successful woman, who knows she is all of those things but doesn't base her identity on them.  There is laughter on every page and I'm sure I will read it many more times to come.
B0051T46XM|4.0|\\"Trollhunter\\" is the latest entry in the fake \\"found footage\\" genre, and if it ever catches on as a cult phenom, it could very well leave \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" and \\"Cloverfield\\" in the dust (if you're into that sort of thing). Like its predecessors, it features an unremarkable, no-name cast; but then again you don't really require the services of an Olivier when most of the dialog is along the lines of \\"Where ARE you!?\\", \\"Look at the size of that f#$%&* thing!\\",  \\"RUN!!!\\" or the ever popular \\"AieEEE!\\". Seriously, though- what I like about Andre Ovredal's film (aside from the surprisingly convincing monsters) is the way he cleverly weaves wry commentary on religion and politics into his narrative. The story concerns three Norwegian film students who initially set off to do an expose on illegal bear poaching, but become embroiled with a clandestine government program to rid Norway of some nasty trolls who have been terrorizing the remote areas of the country (you'll have to suspend your disbelief as to how the government has been able to \\"cover up\\" 200 foot tall monsters rampaging about). The \\"trollhunter\\" himself is quite a character. And one thing to remember while hunting trolls...leave the Christians at home!
B004EPYZU8|4.0|AFTER HEARING SO MUCH BAD about Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch, I really expected to dislike this movie. However, I'm glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised by what I've watched and this is the theatrical cut of the film I'm talking about (I've seen at least three deleted scenes exclusive to the BLU-RAY on YouTube and it's simply up to my mind to fill in the blanks when I watch the movie on DVD and those particular scenes happen to be missing).<br /><br />For the most part, I think I'll just skip over my opinions on the all the Feminist arguments and follow-the-leader \\"I'll compare to this movie to a movie that came out a year earlier\\" commentary that I've seen on around the internet. I'll simply say that for the most part, I think most of the things said about this movie are in fact valid as far as Feminist critique is concerned. Zack Snyder, try as he might, doesn't understand feminism and empowerment for women and shamelessly attempts to cover his fantasy behind a flimsy veil of fan service and a love for how certain types of anime depict females. It wants to subvert the degrading ways women are depicted in media, but it fails in every way possible on this aspect. But is the movie bad because of it? No, not really. It's more embarrassing than anything because it reflects just how badly feminism is misunderstood and seen by general [male] populace on a whole.<br /><br />However, when it comes to knocking an otherwise enjoyable action flick for being an \\"Inception\\" / \\"Matrix\\" ripoff, this is where a lot of the complaints lose me. People did the same thing with \\"[[ASIN:B001OQCVI8 PUSH]] (2009)\\", a sci-fi/superhero movie (I that I loved) that  has almost nothing in common with 2008's \\"[[ASIN:B00177Y9ZC JUMPER]]\\" (a poor adaption of an otherwise great sic-fi novel by Steven Gould) outside of the \\"Evil Organization out to get the protagonist\\" plot and what movie doesn't use that theme? Sucker Punch has superficial similarities to \\"Inception\\" (who's concept is by no means as original as its EXECUTION) and the \\"Matrix\\" and that's where the buck stops.<br /><br />If I have anything bad to say about this movie it's the fact that you cannot skip the DVD Advertisement to get to the DVD Menu (at least on the Rental DVD version). There has to be a told of six to ten minutes worth of BLU-RAY-COMING SOON-NOW ON DVD ads shoved down your throat and you can't skip any of it. That aside, the storyline is as simple as it gets:<br /><br />[A girl, codenamed \\"Baby Doll\\", and her unnamed little sister have suffered the loss of their equally unnamed their mother and are left with a rotten stepfather as their guardian. When he discovers that his wife has left everything to her two daughters, he throws a fit and decides he's going to have his way with the oldest girl. However, when she rebels, he locks her in her bedroom and goes after her little sister (who ends up evading him and locking herself in a closet with his keys). In a panic, Baby Doll exits her bedroom through her window and reenters the house armed with a gun just as the stepfather kicks the closet door open.<br /><br />However, she misses her intended target and kills her sister instead. She's understandably grief stricken that she's robbed herself of the one person that mattered to her and is left with the one she could do without and run from the house. The cops find her at her mother's grave and her stepfather gets her admitted to a presumably all-female insane asylum where she awaits a lobotomy in five days. However, Baby Doll has no intentions of waiting to a hole punched into her head and enlists the help of four girls (Sweet Pea, Rocket, Amber and Blondie) to get her and themselves out of the madhouse. In order to do this, they need five items (a Lighter, Map, Key, Knife and one unnamed item that will be the decider of how the plan goes), but all of them are under the guard of those who would keep them locked inside the madhouse (or brothel, depending how Baby Doll depicts her reality).]<br /><br />Other than that, the enjoyment of the movie hinges on how well the actresses perform and how much you enjoy stylized action sequences straight out of an anime realized by someone who knows how to blend the overtop with visually stunning universes out of a fantasy book and not detract from the overall point of the movie. And with that, for a movie that literally runs on the fuel of a screenplay written by himself, Snyder does a good job. He gets the point of his tale across better than most would be willing to admit. It's certainly not the tasteless and fetishized movie a lot of people made it out to be.<br /><br />When the characters interact with one another it doesn't come off an contrite or something made to kill time between action sequences; on more than one occasion, three out of the five female characters have a actual conversation with each other and the movie is better for it, I think. The relationship between sisters, Rocket and Sweet Pea, as unexplored as it is, for me, was the most genuine part of the movie. The actors Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone, made me believe that they were siblings on polarizing ends of a situation that was guaranteed to fail if something went wrong.<br /><br />However, the one thing he does fail on is the entire concept of a Sucker Punch. Granted, it's no surprise what happens to Baby Doll (they show it at the beginning of the movie for goodness sake), but Between Scott Glenn and Jon Hammm, I'm not sure who gave away the meaning of the entire ending more. The Doctor/High Roller or the Wiseman who likes quote Grandpa from \\"[[ASIN:B00005O5BN The Jackie Chan Adventures]]\\"? If I was surprised by anything it was how abrupt the cut between the close up on Baby Dolls face to the lobotomy needle was, other than that, one of the two the characters I wanted to see get out of that place alive, did and therefore I was content.<br /><br />I, for one, enjoyed all four universes created by Baby Doll, paricularly the Medieval Japan and Futuristic city that bookend the first and final acts of the movie. The action sequences, complemented with a impressive soundtrack of varying sounds and styles of cover songs or remixes of the better known singles of days gone bye, are executed with perfection. The music video feel of it all works well with the interpretation that Baby Doll's dances are interpreted by her mind through violence and a way to achieve her goals which coincide with one another.  I'm not even disappointed in the fact that we never get to see her dance as that was never one of the things I was dying to see in this movie.<br /><br />The acting for the most part is good. Emily Browning isn't a terrible actress, she gets the personality (or lack thereof) and determination of Baby Doll's character across to the audience rather well, but if anything she was one of the weaker performers of the primary cast. Vanessa Hudgens doesn't do a bad job in a movie that is basically her way of trying to become an adult in the wrong way most young actresses tend to do, but she isn't awful until she tries to cry on screen.<br /><br />The actress who plays Amber isn't given anything to do except play wingman for most the movie and therefore has the weakest performance in the movie because she isn't given anything worth its weight in significance. Honestly, the strongest actors in the movie are Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone, who are given more do in the action and non-action sequences any of the other girls combined, especially if you adopt the idea that the tale of the movie is basically a story told in the second person narrative and the story is really about the two sisters (the oldest in particular). I was a little more than misty-eyed at one particular scene between the two (in both realities) just because of how they performed.<br /><br />The orderlies and doctors were just there, I really had no emotional investment in any of them and therefore really can't comment on them other than to say, the orderly-turned-pimp's mustache was the only thing I could look at when he was one screen and, yes, indeed, the Polish accent for the doctor is something out of Rocky and Bulwinkle, but it's hardly distracting in any sense that it's bad. At least the actress is consistent.<br /><br />All in all Sucker Punch is a good movie that does a excellent job of blending fantasy with action and anime with live-action (even if that was unintended or not even a thought in the visual effects artists mind). The movie is a beauty to look at on every level possible. Snyder's direction is competent, but it's nowhere near what he did for \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" or \\"Watchmen\\". I don't think Sucker Punch is great by any means or that I'm even in love with it, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. [4 Out of 5]

Yes, it is that beautiful.<br /><br />Naturally, THAT FACE is the showcase piece of the first CD. Fun, a bit sassy and totally Broadway, the song compliments Barbra Streisand's voice (and vice versa). But don't stop there folks: every cut on the album is a loving performance which is the perfect marriage of actress and singer. When you hear her sing ALONE IN THE WORLD, SO MANY STARS, WHAT MATTERS MOST or any of the cuts, you know that Barbra Streisand believes in the words, thoughts and feelings.<br /><br />The second CD on the Deluxe edition contains material, also written by the Bergman's, that Barbra Streisand recorded before - THE WAY WE WERE, PAPA CAN YOU HEAR ME and PIECES OF DREAMS among the choicest picks.<br /><br />Whatever Barbra Streisand sings, she turns a song and makes it into a classic and a personal triumphant. And the winner is the listener.<br /><br />Is it surprising that for each decade since the sixties, Barbra Streisand has had a # One album? Well, she did it again with WHAT MATTERS MOST. But, more important, she deserves this distinction, and all other accolades.

The carrot and stick incentives of the last century no longer apply in the current workplace. According to Pink, extrinsic motivation and incentives have actually proven to be disincentives in many cases. So, how do you get the best out of people?    Pink focuses on three areas: Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose. Employees who are given control over their own projects and even the ability to create projects on their own are by far more productive and more engaged than employees who are given monetary incentives. The more employers attempt to control their employees, the less productive they become. The more autonomy given to employees, the more engaged and productive they become.    Money does matter, but it's not an adequate incentive for engagement. The role of money is simply that employers should pay their employees well enough that they don't have money worries. But, beyond that, in knowledge work, money proves to be a disincentive. Given the ability to improve their skills or make a significant contribution to the world, employees can more easily reach \\"flow\\" in their work. Work becomes more like play. Time passes without notice. Employees are fully involved in their work.    Many innovative employers like Google offer \\"20 percent time\\" to their workers. This is an opportunity for employees to work on whatever project they choose while on the clock. Gmail was created by a Google employee during 20 percent time.    Goal setting and performance reviews can be motivating or demotivating depending on how they are proposed. An extrinsic set of goals is rarely achieved with a smile on the employees face. Intrinsic goals, however, are far more easily achieved. In fact, engaged employees will set goals for themselves even if the boss isn't looking over their shoulder.    Pink offers a whole new take on human motivation. Employees are not Pavlov's dog waiting for the bell to ring. Human beings have a higher purpose that each is uniquely designed to fulfill. The sooner that employers can identify and engage the activities that their employers will jump out of bed for, the sooner employers will find the key to not only productivity, but also creativity.    This book is especially significant to non-profits and volunteer organizations that depend on unpaid workers. How do you keep volunteers from becoming weary in well-doing? Pink's findings are key to getting the best out of people.    Allen White  allenwhite.org

B005CZQ9I0|5.0|I'm so tiered of todays \\"artist\\" giving us junk. Talent plays a big part in great music, and when you are Barbra Streisand, talent is all you need. Her voice is silky smooth and flawless, as it usually is. Her choice of songs, pretty good. There are several gems here and there is something for everyone. Barbra just keeps getting better & better, and I have a feeling this CD will go to #1 just like her last two did. When you have Barbra Streisand, an original and true artist, do you need anything else?

0553801473|2.0|After devouring all of the earlier books in a single long weekend, I was completely primed for more. This book was very nearly a COMPLETE disappointment! I kept waiting for the OMG(!) parts of the book and they NEVER came. There were a few developments, but nothing that left me not being able to put down the book. For the very little that the story moved along, and considering how many years it took Martin to write this one, everything could have been wrapped up quite neatly in less than 500 pages. I can't tell you how many pages of blather I skipped over, but it was surely 30% or more. It was like trying to plow through all of the wordiness of a Jane Austen novel!<br /><br />I sure hope that the publisher kicks those editors in the @$$ for not slicing this thing into a more palatable serving!
B0018BB20W|5.0|Imagine, if you will, you are a newly reformed British pop/R&B rock band.  Two of your 5 original members have high-tailed it from the group, your excellent lead guitarist Denny Laine and your bass guitar.  You call on an old friend and previous band-mate, bassist and vocalist John Lodge, who gladly hops back on board.  None other than Eric Burdon, of The Animals, recommends a guitarist with velvet vocal chords, Justin Hayward and he also agrees to join the band.  You begin to realize that the success of the band as a whole depends on you abandoning your tried and true formula of American-style blues covers and R&B influenced pop.  So now your producer insists you have the talent to write your own songs and to start over with a whole new face in the mirror.<br /><br />Now you pop off a few radio-friendly tunes which perform well on the Euro-charts and you are all set to get into the studio and do something freakin' fabulous.  The record company you work for, however, has something else up their sleeve.  They have just innovated a new recording system and since you owe them a large amount of debt for unfinished contract items, they are going to give you the chance to showcase this new stereophonic sound and have your debts forgiven.  All you have to do is record a rock and roll version of Dvorak's New World Symphony with the record company's in-house symphony orchestra.  Okay, so you say, Yes!  Sounds like a good idea, no?  That's different!  That's exciting!  That's innovation!<br /><br />There is just one problem.  You don't REALLY want to do it.  The whole idea as a concept is good, mix some new rock motifs with orchestral backing.  The record company is notoriously tight-fisted and likes to micro-manage its artists.  But in the face of adversity, with a little help from the executive producer and from the orchestra leader, you are still able to secretly (at first) record your own compositions and your own concept, a kind of a day-in-the-life showcase, still as a melding of classical and rock, into a very intuitive fusion.<br /><br />No one can argue with you in the aftermath, the album sells gold initially, it hits the #27 mark on the charts, not bad at all, and it will eventually go very multi-platinum.  In fact, your album will be RE-released in five years in the USA and will fly to the #3 spot, not to mention re-releasing the singles for even more prestige and notoriety.  But the fact is, in the face of initial reaction, DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED is something quite unique in the annals of rock history.<br /><br />The Beatles had pioneered the use of classical instrumentation in modern rock and roll a few months earlier, but Mike Pinder of The Moody Blues was in turn the one who turned The Beatles onto the mellotron, a fussy and temper-tantrum-ish instrument that provides beautiful orchestral sounds, sans orchestra, when it works.  The Moody Blues drummer, Graham Edge was noted by the band as being a closet poetry writer, now they called on him to write real poetry to be infused into the new Moody Blues music.<br /><br />So now you may ask how a 60's pop band actually went from being a one-hit-wonder has-been group into being the paradigm of progressive rock and the clear definition of symphonic classic rock?<br /><br />First, thank Decca staff producer Tony Clarke sometimes known as \\"The Sixth Moodie\\".  Tony Clarke would produce all of The Moody Blues albums and singles for the next eleven years.<br /><br />Then there is Engineer Derek Varnals who would also contribute significantly to the creation of the Moody Blues studio sound.  Derek worked with Pinder & Clarke to create a more symphonic overlapping sound on the Mellotron as opposed to the sharp cut-off the instrument would normally give.  This was partly achieved by removing all the sound effects tapes that came with the Mellotron and then doubling up the tapes of orchestral instrument sounds, which, under Pinder's effortless ability and sensitivity at playing; and Derek's recording skills at creating an orchestral wave sound that characterized the non-orchestra accompanied sound; this became the heart of the Moody Blues sound from here on.  It also helped that Mike Pinder had worked for the company that manufactured the Mellotron and had become their most talented technical adviser.<br /><br />Okay.  Let's talk about the CD versus the vinyl album many (most) of us original Moody Blues fans purchased.  I happen to have purchased the original record and from Amazon a few years ago I purchased the NON-Deluxe remaster which has intense beautiful sound without high and low distortion (thankfully not a victim of the loudness wars in remastering).  Here are some notes for you and for the new youth discovering our Moodies all over again:<br /><br />Most of us Americans did not get DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED until 1972 when it was released in the USA during the wait for the Moody Blues 7th SOJOURN, about the same time as most Americans were exposed to Nights In White Satin as a hit single.  It was one of the most successful re-issues in  music history.  College \\"heads\\" did not get exposed to The Moody Blues until IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD in '68, mainly through word of mouth.  In 1978, the album was remixed because of degradation of the master tapes.  The original 1967 masters were deteriorating at a rapid rate and thankfully, the Moody Blues team acted promptly to save them.  Consequently, the original 1967 album has never and will never be heard on CD.  The remix of '78 is all that has ever been released on CD and many of us can identify subtle changes in the music.  Notable differences by track:  Dawn Is A Feeling, more abrupt beginning after the orchestral introduction, less echo on Pinder's vocals; Lunch Break orchestral part is longer and guitar is missing;  the Moody Blues to London Festival Orchestra segue in Tuesday Afternoon is more natural and sounds like one flute playing through the entire piece;  Evening Time To Get Away has John singing alone apparently where backing vocals have been lost, this song seems to have undergone the most extensive remixing of them all, the title refrain is sung only twice instead of three times, and, the mellotron is significantly missing from the coda; The Sunset is missing the entire piano instrumental section and Pinder's warbly reverb on the last word is quite different from the original; Twilight Time backing vocals used to be only in a few spots and now are consistently through the entire song; Nights In White Satin and also the orchestral opening to the album, The Day Begins are the only two songs which seem to not be noticeably impacted by the remix.  In the case of Nights In White Satin, I believe the original master was saved but there IS something, however slight, which I cannot put my finger on, where the song does indeed seem \\"different\\" from the original vinyl.  If anyone has any clue to this, comments are greatly welcomed!<br /><br />Most of us, as I said started our Moody Blues fascination with IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD and ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM, and it just got better from there.  There was no internet and we relied mostly on Rolling Stone and other music mags for our intelligence on artists.  There was a rumor about DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED and in hindsight I have to say that when most of us Americans picked up this album, in the same year as the waning of the Moody Blues as the group we loved, 7TH SOJOURN would prove to be the swan song of the core and no other album would ever live up to these seven even though Pinder would come back for a brief appearance on the 8th (OCTAVE); in hindsight and with years of listening, DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED was a most significant album in the history of rock music.  It is a wonderful work of art and though some fans do not hold it up to the greatness of the next 5 albums (it is often ranked just above 7th SOJOURN which foolishly is considered \\"weak\\"), I believe it has grown in my own estimation and I find myself listening to it more and more often and enjoying it more than I used to.  In fact I believe it is more cohesive, more expressive, and more interesting album than THRESHOLD OF A DREAM which received huge accolades in its time.  One has to remember that The Moody Blues were never treated very kind by Rolling Stone and the other trade magazines, most of the critics of the day just loved to call music like that of the Moodies \\"pretentious\\" and it was a sign of pure adulation of fans that their albums all sold so well (every one of the \\"core 7\\" going multi-platinum) and despite their singles performed rather dull even though they broke the 100 charts.  Most of the Moody Blues singles taken from the seven albums failed to crack the top 20, they were definitively a album-oriented group.  Nights In White Satin hit #2 spot on its re-release in '72, and I'm Just A Singer In A Rock & Roll Band made it to #12 in the same year.  Ride My See Saw and Never Comes The Day never broke #60 and #90 respectively and Watching & Waiting failed to chart at all.  Question and Story In Your Eyes performed much better at #21 and #23.  Compare those stats to the fact that the albums all sold immensely well:<br /><br />DAYS OF FUTURE PASSED #3 (after re-release in '72)<br />IN SEARCH OF THE LOST CHORD #23<br />ON THE THRESHOLD OF A DREAM #20<br />TO OUR CHILDRENS CHILDRENS CHILDREN #14<br />A QUESTION OF BALANCE #3<br />EVERY GOOD BOY DESERVES FAVOUR #2<br />7TH SOJOURN #1<br /><br />So now imagine if you will, as you sit in your favorite listening place, poised between the surround of sound, a magical journey begins and you depart on waves of colorful melody, lush, deep, embracing.  Would not you want to take that memorable voyage at least 6 more times, each one being a different but just as wonderful trip?  So the answer is:  take this journey without hesitation, and take each of the next six at the very least.  they are all immensely pleasurable and you will find yourself returning to them again and again and again!  The Moody Blues asked a lot of questions, and they left it to us actually, the audience, to provide the answers.

B0026PW67W|4.0|First off I just want to say that when I recieved the Marauders Map it was bent inside of the Amazon box, and I did not like that one bit. Second the map really does give off that feel of magic that is just waiting to happen. All in all it is a really good collectors item. Although, as others have already pointed out, I am thoroughly disappointed that none of the Hogwarts houses were included in the blue print. It would have been all to simple to place them in their appropriate place on the map. If you are thinking of buying this, if you are a true fan, then I encourage you to do so.

0446556750|5.0|This is an excellent Connelly. A young girl has been killed 25 years ago and the killer condemned. Then, the Supreme Court sends the killer back to trial. A DNA sample from the little girl's dress proves that the semen on the dress did belong to somebody else. Does it mean that the man condemned for the crime is innocent? We re dragged in all the difficulties of a trial that is 25 years old: witnesses that died or got on drugs, plus the inevitable lowlife who lies. Detective Bosh and the Lincoln lawyer in the unlikely role of a prosecutor, have to come up with a new analysis of the facts, a new interpretation of the killer's motives. It is well done, fascinating and small facts are tied in carefully.

0375704027|3.0|I suppose if you are between the ages of 15 and 22, you might think this novel a masterpiece.  This was my first venture into Murakami-land,  after reading and loving David Mitchell, Kobo Obe, and Kazuo Ishiguro. Chomping at the bit to read my first by this legendary author, perhaps I made the wrong decision of which one to read first. Although beautifully written, I found this to be nothing more than a typical, traditional, coming-of-age story, full of youthful angst and yearning.  No unique or refreshing insights or revelations, either stylistic or substantive. Seems to me to be dated and unoriginal.  Three suicides, watching porn for kicks/education, sexual awakening, sex vs love, am I happier with damaged, but so deeply loved depressive, or should I be with the outgoing lover of life?  Yawn- I'm so over it.  Not similar in tone, structure, or thought to any of the aforestated authors.  I won't give up, however, and look forward to trying again with The Wind-Up Bird Chronicles.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|Ever since I had heard of the line-up for this band I was intrigued..  Joe Bonamassa, Glenn Hughes, Derek Sherinian, Jason Bonham.. how could it fail!??  Indeed it turns out that the band is a potent combination.  A wonderful slice of base rock!  The DVD included in this CD/DVD pack is a nice inclusion, giving some insight into the band's inception, along with a couple of live performances (One Last Soul and Deep Purple's \\"Mistreated\\", showcasing the delightful blending of the band as well as Glenn Hughes amazing vocals, still going strong!    Why four stars?  Well, Black Country Communion 2 came along and became one of those rare beasts.. a follow-up which improved upon the debut, but don't mistake this for thinking that this first CD should be skipped!  If you like your rock with more than a little fire then personally I say grab both whilst you can, starting with this one.
1589949811|3.0|To be fair, I have not played many times, but there is a reason for that. As many people have said, this game is tough and especially as a solo game which was my main purpose for purchasing. In fact, I think it is too tough as a solo game. I am a fan of challenging games, but holy crap! It's not a bad game... The art is great and there are plenty of variances, but it is REALLY hard if you plan on playing it solo all the time! Be aware. That's all I am saying.

0385335997|5.0|I'm a very rational person, but reading these books puts me on the verge of needing therapy. I get so wrapped up in the Outlander books it affects other areas of my life. I am on the edge of feeling as if Claire, Jamie and all the other characters are actually real people. I know that later in the series parts of the story take place in upstate NY near where I live, and I know it will just drive me completely bananas. I burned through Voyager in 48 hours. I can't remember ever being so enthralled by a book or series before. I know I have several more to go, but at this rate I'll be done with them within a month, and I will be so sad.
0316056863|4.0|Impressions:    I've been a Tina Fey fan for a while.  I love her show 30 Rock and her comedy.  I heard great reviews of how funny this book would be so when I needed a few more dollars to get my Amazon cart over twenty five dollars.. I got it.  I'm glad I did; I recommend this book to adults who enjoy comedy and can stomach liberal convictions.    Thoughts:    Tina details her experiences well and always brings you back to a smile through every story and important life event.  She followed her dreams and fell right in to place writing and producing her own show.  I laughed at her self-deprecation and silly scenarios.  I would even call her story inspirational in that she accomplishes her goals through hard work.  She never leaves out a tale about her family and loving husband.  She balances her life with a heap of silliness everyday, something I would like to advocate for!    Quotes:        Dr. Spaceman enters from I.C.U.  His lab coat is covered in blood.

B0058OUJA4|1.0|I don&apos;t get how people can say this game is enjoyable?  First, it&apos;s a rip off of another TD (I know Hex is a rip itself, but it&apos;s like there&apos;s no originality at all here).  Second, the game is waaaayyy too hard!  The first level is quite easy, but then you get to the second... which happens to be labeled &quot;Tutorial&quot;.  I don&apos;t know if that&apos;s just there to insult the player or what, but you NEVER should be able to &quot;lose&quot; on a tutorial level.   It really is a good thing I this was featured as a free app, because to me it isn&apos;t worth 10 cents, let alone $2.

076790592X|5.0|This is a beautiful, life-changing, life-affirming book. \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is a story that will make the reader rethink his or her relationships and can be the start of a healing process for estranged families. The enthusiasm for life that this man has is astounding and incredibly uplifting. His philosophy is that each day we wake up is a gift from God, so what do we do with a gift? Do we celebrate, honor and cherish it or defile, ignore and take it for granted? Morrie never loses his dignity because he never loses his love and appreciation of that gift. This is a book to treasure and re-read whenever we've had a bad day and buy plenty to keep on hand for gifts.

B000N3ST7A|4.0|A nice compilation of Stevie Nicks favorites, it was good to hear some of these again.  Not real sure what is up with the dance mix of Dreams, but I am old enough to remember how amazing it was in it's original form.  The choice of Rhiannon was off, nothing will ever match the power of the Fleetwood Mac live album version, but again, I remember when Stevie could summon her with the power of voice alone, you could see Rhiannon manifest and you knew the stories were true!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I have finally ordered one of these and now I can't stand the wait.  I read all of the reviews here and everyone makes this thing sound like the only knife in town.  I of course will post an actual review once I get my hands on it.  My brother bought me a USMC Ka-Bar so I have high expectations for this one.  Stand by for further review.    Last night (8-29) I had my new little friend waiting for me when I got home from work.  Needless to say I was very excited to open the box.  I was a little disturbed by the packaging, it was just a plain brown box that was way too large for it and it was loosely wrapped in bubble wrap with the warranty just thrown in there.  My USMC Ka-Bar came in a Ka-Bar box so I was a little suprised how this one came.  Anyway, it is exactly what I expected, a very solid, heavy, beautiful piece of steel.  I of course could not leave it alone and immediately wrapped it in paracord and since I will not be carrying it on my belt, I removed the cheap belt loop.  I will be using the knife for hand carving walking sticks and to carry in my camelbak when on my dirt bike in the woods so I needed something strong and I think this will fit the bill.  I have posted a picture too.
B0042816YK|5.0|I put off getting and watching this movie for a long time.  Then, ultimately, I had to watch it and it has not left that little corner of my mind since, what a beautiful movie. This is not an Oscar event worthy movie, but it IS a movie that will make you happy time and again.

While there is noticable rasp in her voice when she goes for the more powerful notes, she still is able to do things with her voice that most youngsters can't. Some of my favorite songs on this album are \\"Something New In My Life\\" \\"Alone In The World\\" \\"The Same Hello, The Same Goodbye\\" and \\"I'll Never Say Goodbye\\"
B004EPYZU8|1.0|I have now seen 3 movies by Zack Snyder; Watchmen, 300, and Sucker Punch.  And all of them suck.  Each of them featured a great idea, an original idea never turned into a movie before, and all were overly surreal movies that lacked empathy, relied too much on stylized action, and superhuman feats of strength.  The only thing original about this one was the use of five women as the key characters; three blondes and two Asians.  The casting really did not matter here, the script was just bad.  The dialog was boring, and the movie reminded me of previous all-chic action flicks like Charlie's Angels.  All in all, a waste of time and money.
B002TVQ4HG|3.0|I'm always interested in stories about the Bermuda Triangle so I thought I'd give \\"Triangle\\" a try; it was not what I was expecting.<br /><br />In one regard I have to give this movie credit, it was well planned. The only problem was it didn't make any sense; if you're looking for a movie with an explanation this is not one of those.<br /><br />I have to admit it was intriguing enough that I watched it all the way through, hoping there would be some resolution to the puzzle which there wasn't. There was lots of gore and blood so if this kind of thing entertains you this may be a good choice.<br /><br />The movie, for its type, is well crafted and creates suspense and even curiosity about how it's going to end. There was, for me, a surprise twist at the ending which I totally didn't expect.<br /><br />I would recommend watching it before you buy it.

B0051MKNV8|5.0|Contrary to popular belief, we humans do use virtually 100% of our brain.  But if you can get past that as most people do believe we use 10% of our brain, you will enjoy this movie.  Basically the point of it is, what if you became 90% smarter than you were before.<br /><br />Limitless is based off the 2001 book called \\"The Dark Fields\\" by Alan Glynn.  The story centers around Eddie Morra(Bradley Cooper), a wannabe writer who somehow has a writing contract, yet he hasn't written one word of his expected novel, he is dumped by his girlfriend (Abbie Cornish), who as she put it was his \\"cleaning lady\\" and his \\"bank\\".  So basically Eddie is a washed up bum.  But then as a chance of fate, he runs into his ex brother-in-law, Vernon,(Johnny Whitworth) a drug dealer who gives him a pill nicknamed NZT that he says will enhance his creativity and cause him to use 100% of his brain.  At first Eddie seems skeptical but decides to take the pill.  Surprisingly the pill works, and Eddie becomes so smart he is able to write his entire novel in 4 days.<br /><br />Eddie comes to find Vernon to get more pills, and Vernon tells him to get his laundry and bring him breakfast first, Eddie finishes the errands and returns to Vernon's apartment to find the place torn apart and Vernon murdered.  Knowing whoever done this must have been looking for Vernon's stash, Eddie searches all over and finally finds the pill and some cash inside the oven.<br /><br />With his huge supply of pills and some starting capital, Eddie is able to find secret formulas in the stock market and make a ton of cash in just a few days.  A big investor, Carl Van Loon,(Robert De Niro) becomes very interested in him.  Eddie feels he is on top of the world, but there are still some problems.  The drug is highly addictive and if he stops taking it he realizes he loses his intelligence and he becomes very sick.  The drug has strange side effects such as loss of time, and black outs.  Also, a strange man keeps following him, and even tries to kill his girlfriend when she has the pills on her to bring to Eddie when he is suffering from NZT withdrawal.<br /><br />As the movie progresses, Eddie has to deal with all the people that want his drug, and he has to keep finding ways to get more.  He discovers billionaire investors that made all their money because of this incredible drug.  He pays scientists to figure out the ingredients and make more, so that he has a limitless supply to support is limitless intelligence.<br /><br />This movie caught my attention because of the idea that you could be so incredibly smart that you could become the richest person on the planet, the president of the United States, every woman would want you, the possibilities would be limitless(hence the name, but everything comes at a price, and at the end of the day it would a drug you were taking, and we all know the consequences of drugs.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|How can I put into words how much I enjoyed, loved, and needed this book...this series. I can't. I can only say the ending was what I needed...I needed to know the future of Katniss, Gabe, Peeta, Haymitch, all of them and in her (Suzanne C.) own unique way I found out. This series has to be one of the most brilliant I have ever read. I was ecstatic when I learned they would be putting it on the big screen. I hope that more and more people will pick up these books and enter the world that Suzanne Collins created so well. I'm sad to have to say goodbye to these characters as I read my last line just a few moments ago but I know that I will revisit them again because this is one of those rare books that you know you will pick up and revisit. I cannot tell you just how much I enjoyed this series....each and every book meant something different to me...so much so I'm getting my own bow.

0937381888|5.0|I agree with Lynn Hoffman's review that the Papazian, Miller and Palmer are all good in their own way and quite different in character.  Miller's approach is more scholarly, analytical and scientific, but also very practical.  Papazian's is very light and friendly but not too deep.  Probably the best single book is Palmer's.  It has fair depth on a lot of topics and also almost encyclopedic breadth.  Pretty comprehensive and excellent book.    One of the complaints about Miller is that it's not organized linearly, but any book that covers extract and grain brewing is going to have some material repeated and unique to each of those techniques.  In a way I find Miller better organized with that in mind.  Palmer attempts to do something similar when he describes extract brewing then expands and adds topics like mashing when addressing grain brewing.  In that way, both books have similar structure.  Both Miller and Palmer are good presentations and have things to recommend them.  I would suggest that both would be useful to a homebrewer.  It's a shame that the Miller seems to be out of print.  He has a newer title that some reviewers say is disorganized.  I haven't gotten a look at it yet.  My comments refer to his 1989 \\"The Complete Handbook of Homebrewing.\\"  Miller feels self-edited with a lot of discipline and rigor.  Palmer feels perhaps a bit too much edited down.    Miller may appeal to scientists and engineers more.  Palmer may better suit artists, hands-on, do-it-yourself types.  Homebrewers need to be all of those things at times, so they may like both books.
0446569895|5.0|I enjoy good music of every genre, but rock has always been my first love & Ozzy has always been a favorite.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm so glad I bought his book.  It wasn't the best written autobiography I've ever read, but it gave me a much broader view of the person he is, what he's been through, & what he learned.  Reading about another's hardships & mistakes really helps me deal with my own.  It gives me a reference for the \\"uh oh's\\" in life.

B0001Z37HM|3.0|A small film in many ways with little to say about it and to bring up and to tell and to speak for it. A mysterious talisman, green in light, is the creating stone of this world but is getting out of hand and has to be destroyed. Only women can touch it without running any risk but there are plenty of people who want to have that stone of power.<br /><br />Another evil ambitious woman gets into the picture and tries to get the stone from the priestesses that keep it, at the very moment it was going to be destroyed. Many men and women die, all the priestesses and attendants except one that runs away through a back door.<br /><br />There comes our man, the only positive man or nearly the only one in the story, since the other one is a child, comes into the picture, saves the messenger and let Red Sonja know about her mission: recapture and destroy that green talisman of bad omen. Don't worry, they will succeed.<br /><br />What's maybe original, if not entirely new in this fable: the government of women is in no way better than that of men. Women are just as bad as men when jealousy and ambition seize them by the hair. And men are as bad as women with their drives and other impulses.<br /><br />So what's left after all that. Not much, except a man and a woman who of course fall for one another and each other. Hollywood cannot avoid such simple endings, though they forget to marry them and make them have twenty-five children after that.<br /><br />Enjoy the suspense of that suspense-less film and the thrills of this thrill-less story. They even invented a mechanical metal underwater monster that has to be blinded to be defeated. You can hear the popping noise of each eye falling out of their orbits under the sharp point of some nice and useful knife. Better than picking your teeth with that dagger.<br /><br />Apart from that the music or Sergio Morricone is not bad at all. We are close to some macaroni barbaric age films, but we can survive that experience, with spicy olive oil and Mozzarella and Murazzano.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUJacques COULARDEAU
0061784788|4.0|Truly another remarkable book that intertwines science and history. I do have to say that two issues were presented that will complicate the immediate future. Not wanting to give away the book but the first issue is the personnel changes. I truly have grown to like the current cast and their adventures and skills are well documented. Often as a reader I find it hard to deal with possible future replacements because though they are unique they often are satirized and references by other characters are made referencing that individual in the past. My second issue is the development of new intrests in that it can be a good thing or it can be a bad thing. Depending on how the next story goes will determine if it will add or detract from the story line. Great job Mr. Rollins great job.
B004WJREMW|3.0|A year before Wings officially disbanded in 1981, Paul McCartney followed the same path he'd trod as the Beatles fell apart in 1969: he retreated to the studio to record an album all by himself. Much like 1970's [[ASIN:B004WJRF6C McCartney]], McCartney II was an outlet for ideas that might not have fit his band, and an opportunity for the artist to explore more contemporary sounds. The results weren't as organic as the earlier solo album, often leaping ahead from Wings to contemporary synthesizer-influenced arrangements that, like many records from the 1980s, have aged poorly. Still, McCartney's catchy hooks and memorable melodies were delivered with a crowd-pleasing smile. The album's hit, \\"Coming Up,\\" scored on the UK charts and was in regular rotation on MTV, but it was a live version recorded by Wings that scored stateside. A second single, \\"Waterfall,\\" scored in the UK, but only grazed the bottom of the U.S. chart.<br /><br />The experimental sides feel as if McCartney needed to prove he was more than a Top 40 hit-maker, but they aren't particularly convincing. The repetitive, droning chorus of \\"Temporary Secretary\\" sounds like a cut-rate mash-up of Kraftwerk and Devo, the instrumentals \\"Front Parlour\\" and \\"Frozen Jap\\" sound like something scratched out on a toy Casio keyboard, and \\"Summer's Day Song\\" is thin and unfinished. Better are the spare blues of \\"On the Way\\" and back-to-roots finish of \\"Nobody Knows,\\" trading production value for a peek behind the curtain of McCartney's stage polish. The acoustic closer, \\"One of These Days,\\" though not one of McCartney's greatest lyrics, does provide a moment of reconciliation with the life changes swirling about him.<br /><br />Hear/Concord's 2011 reissue offers a sharp remaster of the original album, along with an eight-track bonus disc. The new tracks include the 1979 live version of \\"Coming Up\\" which appeared as a B-side U.S. hit for the studio version. Oddly, the single's other B-side, Wings' \\"Lunchbox/Odd Sox,\\" is not included. Two more B-sides, \\"Check My Machine\\" and \\"Secret Friend,\\" are also included. McCartney's non-album single \\"Wonderful Christmastime,\\" and four previously unreleased session tracks, including the orchestrated instrumental \\"Blue Sway,\\" fill out the bonuses. The all-cardboard four-panel slipcase and booklet include photos, lyrics and credits. This album has a few candid moments, but it's not the burst of creativity found on McCartney, and represents something of a lull between Wings and McCartney's forthcoming hit single collaborations.

1579128149|5.0|This book is an excellent presentation of the elements by an avid element collector. The book is full of high-quality pictures, showing the elements in both their pure form and their various applications, as well as brief, but good descriptions of their history, uses, and trivia. The author is very passionate about this subject, which makes for an informative, but entertaining read.    The book's layout is simple: each of the first 100 elements gets 2 facing pages (4 for more important elements), starting with hydrogen, and going on up. The left-hand page is a full-page image of the element in pure or very close to pure form, and the right-hand page contains the text describing the element, as well as several pictures of devices that are made up the element. Often these are pictures of the thousands of things that the author has collected for his element collection over the years. For the more important or more interesting elements, there are an additional 2 pages of photos. All of the elements also include diagrams showing their crystal structure, electron orbitals, and melting and freezing points, and other important information.    Elements 101-118 have shorter information sections and no pictures because there is very little relevant information about them.    Overall, this is a very high-quality book. It's well-written (I don't remember seeing any spelling or grammar mistakes); the pictures are well-taken, have good lighting, and are high resolution; the book is made of thick, strong paper; and the ink and print quality is among the best.    This book is excellent light reading and is a perfect coffee table book. Each element's section is short enough that it can be read in a minute or two, so it's great to have around for people to look at when they come over. Also, it's very non-technical, so almost anyone can read it. I'd recommend this book to pretty much everyone, especially those with an interest in science and chemistry.

I bought the 1st book because it had so many reviews on Amazon, and Amazon recommended it to me (it has not steered me wrong yet). It sat on my shelf for a month, because I just didn't think it would be something I like. The book sounded sci-fi and futuristic from the back of it. Boy, was I wrong.

0345529057|5.0|Whatever, the first thing I will say is I am not a writer nor do I consider myself worthy to criticize books. Half the people who post reviews puke out a bunch of literary terms they just looked up or fart out some big thesaurus words from their arse.    Anyway, I read a lot. I read a lot of fantasy. This book is so sweet. The characters are diverse and dynamic, the plot is as viscous as curdled milk and the political intrigue, with the twang of fantasy makes for exciting adventure.    If you like fantasy, read it. If you like filthy love scenes and gratuity you have to read it.     If you can't stomach, histories, names and seemingly minute details, maybe read the abridged version.     Cheers

0545123291|5.0|The characters were amazingly rounded by the first person narration.  The story was told so uniquely that the reader can personally identify with every single character.  Each character was opened and swept up in the current of the fast-paced plot in a way that made the pages fly by.  This book series was so well done that I cheered out loud and wept for the characters before I finished the final pages of book three. This book and series are a great read for those fans of Twilight, The Fallen series, Vampire Academy series, or just a fan of myth and lore outside the mainstream books.

There is optimism while reading, knowing that Jaycee is alive and willing to share this. There is genuine hatred for a man who abused a young child with such ferocity. I recommend this book highly simply because human dignity prevails, that a life is slowly healed, and to savor Jaycee's comment that she will \\"never waste another second in the presence of this man.\\" Well done Dugard.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|With a few minor quibbles (hysteria occurred way too often) this was a very good opening in what I hope becomes a series.  I would like to see what happens with Rose and what's his name, well you find out       (*************MINOR SPOILER COMING*************)        that the love interest's name isn't really Joe as he says it is, so why not a follow up so we can find out who he really is and whether Rose maintains her new 'self' and her new haircut as she goes through the rapid changes bound to follow the traumatic conclusion of Twenty Eight and a Half.    Yes it's sort of a bucket list kind of book but in a charmingly and disarmingly kind of way.     Thank goodness the real bad guy isn't obvious too early and there are plenty of red herrings thrown around that motivations seem to change on a daily or hourly basis.      I liked Rose, her sister Violet, what's his name, Mike and the babies.  Please write me more of their story!

0316098329|4.0|'Room' was a devastating story of 'Jack' and 'Ma,' two people forced to live in an eleven-by-eleven room, created by her captor. Having the story told by 'Jack,' who was born in and only knew the room was effective because his innocence and vulnerability was present in every word. There was hope there too, though. He could survive this. The story of 'Ma,' on the other hand, was a bit more unsettling. 'Jack's' perspective of her was perfect for the timing and fluency of the story.    Over all, the book was well-written and authentic, even if the author never experienced the real-life tragedy involved.    So much went without saying in this story, and what was said was gorgeously written. So, so elegant. There was so much dialogue in the book, but it was never bogged down with inconsequential detail.

B002RKSXJG|3.0|Wilke Collins' approach writing from the perspective of the main characters was unique and intriguing.  Collins' differentiation of the characters' emotional and moral perspective is what held my interest.  My response to the actions and motives of the characters ran from infatuated to infuriated to frustrated to admiration (and many points in between.)  Being an elder baby boomer, I found the verbiage and pace often ponderous and annoying early on but relaxed into style as I got into the book.  Most impressively Collins is able to take twists and turns in the story because of his characters diverse and perverse moral development.      I highly recommend this book for the avid, adventurous, thoughtful  and perseverant reader.  Not for someone looking for escape with mindless entertainment.

B004EPYZUI|4.0|REVIEW MAY HAVE SPOILERS! I felt that I needed to review this film to counter all the analytics with absolutely no imagination whatsoever. This movie was thoroughly enjoyable for those few of us who are creative, inspired and artistic. With a very original plot (how many movies coming out of Hollywood can make that claim these days?) it opens up a world that is almost as creative as the Matrix. Maybe not quite as intricate, but I felt a breath of fresh air from this film's sheer creativity.<br /><br />Since almost all of the epic fight-scenes were taking place in the mind of a character, it was absolutely open-ended. There is nothing to say that one CAN'T fight a dragoon with a WWII-era airplane. Or go into battle against steam-powered zombie Nazis in a mech from the future. Let's face it. Many of us that had over-active imaginations as a child used to DREAM about this stuff. There is a Calvin & Hobbes comic where Calvin is playing with his toy dinosaurs and introduces an F-14 fighter jet into the fray, piloted by a T-Rex. Hobbes, ever the realist and grounded one, thinks it is stupid. But the child in us all related so well to that comic because we all wanted to break the rules and have T-Rexes attacking triceratops and stegosauruses with a jet. We did it. Transformers would join in the action-figure battles with X-Men and a GI-Joe here and there in a Lego city. What I am getting at is that it was all in her MIND. So why is any of this stupid?<br /><br />Maybe you felt immature letting your imagination loose and embracing the child within. Maybe you felt emasculated by it even. Or maybe you just lack the ability too imagine something so ridiculously crazy-awesome, that it made you insecure. Who knows? Who cares, though? This movie was, for me anyhow, the epitome of FUN, and in the end that is what movies are ALL ABOUT: entertainment. So look for a sophisticated plot if you'd like. You aren't going to find it here, and like Calvin's clubs, we don't want you here anyhow. We want people who like giant Samurais fighting with mini-guns. And T-Rexes in fighter jets. Because we just want to be entertained and have fun!ople who like giant Samurais fighting with mini-guns. And T-Rexes in fighter jets. Because we just want to be entertained and have fun!
B0002858YS|5.0|I am a latecomer to this CD--it's been out awhile. A workout buddy of mine loves to play Pandora radio while we do our workouts, and some of the songs from this CD kept popping up, and I really liked them for working out to; turns out they are really good songs for just jamming in the car, too. This is just a really good CD with great energy.
B00009V7T2|2.0|I like Metal, Rock, Prog whatever. But this album sounds like noise throughout most of the album, it has its moments....but most of it sounds awful in way that reminds me of Black Flag. I'm a touch disappointed after all the rave reviews.
B0000691U1|5.0|I love small ensemble jazz. Yes, the Ellington big band material is great and I enjoy it, but I feel much more connected to the music when listening to a smaller ensemble. This recording is a classic; some may find this blasphemy, but I think it ranks in the same high echelon as Miles Davis' Kind of Blue. Duke Ellington's piano playing is just fantastic here--and his playing tends to get swallowed up in the big band recordings. And of course Max Roach and Charlie Mingus, well....what can I say about these legends that hasn't already been said? If you like jazz and don't have this, buy it. It is a must for any listener. One curiosity about it for me is the cover; check it out carefully. I know Mingus was known for his temper, but the look on his face on this jacket cover is almost disconcerting: he looks like he's about to kill somebody. I have no idea what that is all about, but wow what a recording!
B000023VR6|4.0|Very please with my purchase. Received item in a timely manner, within two business days. Great purchase and great service. Very, Very, Pleased.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|Lady Gaga is a guilty pleasure for me. I really don't want to like her music. I mean, come on, I listen to some pretty progressive music, indie bands, classical, even some avant-garde jazz. I should not like this record. But somehow I do. It's just fun music to dance and sing along to, and I do. And if you tell any of my friends I like this record I'll have to hurt you. Or at least call you names...or something.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|I'm a big fan of TD games in general and this is the first really excellent one I've found for Android.  Overall this is a pretty standard semi-open field TD game with standard tower types (gun, splash, laser, slow, area) and a good range of upgrades.  The vector-style graphics are pretty cool, in my opinion, and they make it a bit easier to see what's going on when the fur starts flying.  The effects are well done if a tad distracting.  What makes this one stand out is the playability - it takes no time at all to get up and going, the tower placement is very intuitive, and I especially like that you can queue upgrades.  My only gripe with the UI is that the upgrade and sell buttons are a little too close together.  I've only mistakenly sold a tower once but it seems like one poorly positioned tap could ruin a round.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Super powerful level editor. Great graphics. Very challenging, but entertaining. Fun. This guy knows what he&apos;s doing. English is a little weird at times but noing serious.
B001DJXX6U|5.0|This is a superb package for the vinyl fan.      The sound is fantastic and for 5 records, less than $20 / each is a steal.      The Comfortably Numb is superb, Echoes is awesome.      I am a fan of Gilmour's solo stuff so the combination of his original material with Pink Floyd selections makes these some of my most played vinyl.    I am using Manley tube gear with Von Schweikert Audio speakers and even at mid dial on my pre-amp, it's like the band is in my living room.    Highly recommended for the vinyl collector!
B0025KW29U|5.0|my friend invited me to watch this at her place, and i gotta admit, i wasn't really expecting much.  i was pleasantly surprised while watching this movie.  i found myself bobbing my head with the songs and laughing at the well-written, albeit, cheesy script.  definitely a must-see for people who enjoy musicals.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Just be warned.  These are NOT the Original Trilogy films.  The best quality of the Original trilogy is the non-widescreen, letterboxed Japanese laserdisc version available on DVD.  Because that is the highest quality the Original Trilogy has been released.  Period.

0062065963|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

B005HI4LMS|5.0|Ever seen a horror movie with hillbillies in it? They're usually psychotic chainsaw-swinging inbred cannibal psychos who like to murder anyone who happens to drive by.<br /><br />But don't expect any of THAT to actually appear in \\"Tucker & Dale Vs Evil,\\"  a clever black comedy that asks, \\"What if the HILLBILLIES were the innocent victims of the doomed college kids?\\" Tropes are inverted (or lampshaded), there's gore aplenty, and Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine make endearingly rough-hewn heroes.<br /><br />West Virginia hillbillies Dale (Labine) and Tucker (Tudyk) have just bought a dilapidated little house out by a remote lake, and plan to spend some time fishing and drinking beer. They also end up rescuing Allison (Katrina Bowden), a college student who hit her head while swimming, and she soon finds that these seemingly terrifying hillbillies are actually kind, gentle and sometimes quite smart.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Allison's friends get the wrong idea, and think that she's being held captive by a pair of chainsaw-swinging psychos. As they try to attack Dale and Tucker, they end up accidentally dying in bizarre and gory ways. As Dale, Tucker and Allison try to defuse the situation, they also have to deal with the increasingly bloodthirsty Chad (Jesse Moss).<br /><br />I have no idea why it's taken so long for \\"Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil\\" to make it onto DVD, because this movie is absolutely hilarious -- a gory, satirical little comedy that acknowledges every hillbilly-slasher cliche right before turning it on its ear. And yes, writer/director Eli Craig homages many a horror movie, from \\"Evil Dead\\" to \\"Friday the 13th.\\"<br /><br />And even though it's obviously a spoof, \\"Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil\\" is actually very well-written -- clever foreshadowing, a shocking climactic twist, and all sorts of hilarious situations that make Dale and Tucker look... well, like psycho hillbillies. For instance: Tucker accidentally destroys a beehive, and ends up racing through the woods, screaming and waving his chainsaw spastically.<br /><br />And yes, there are lots of OTHER hilarious moments, such as lampshading hillbilly stereotypes (\\"Oh, I love Earl Grey\\") and the college kids' gory deaths (impaling themselves on sticks or jumping into woodchippers).<br /><br />And the acting is absolutely brilliant. Labine and Tudyk are amazing as the protagonists, respectively playing a sweet timid teddy bear and an outgoing good ol' boy. Yeah, don't judge these guys from their appearances, because you will be ALL WRONG. And the rest of the small cast also does an excellent job, especially given that most of them are shrieking horror movie cliches.<br /><br />\\"Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil\\" is pretty clearly destined to be a cult classic, right alongside other fun spoofs like \\"Shaun of the Dead.\\" Hilarious, bloody and clever.ally.

034552554X|5.0|Victoria knew she could identify flowers and what effect they would have on a person.  She could choose flowers and know what emotion they would evoke and what the person receiving the flowers needed.<br /><br />Victoria had a talent, but she was a foster child moving from one home to the next and had to deal with this ordeal first......then she turned 18 and was turned out of the foster care system and on her own.  Where would she go and what would she do now?  After sleeping in the woods for some time, hunger and cold made her walk boldly into a flower shop and ask to help the florist.  This was the beginning of a great relationship between Victoria and her talent with flowers....it had instinctively been developed in her and was a natural gift.<br /><br />Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh....the book was absolutely wonderful and beautifully written.  I totally and completely LOVED it.<br />You could definitely connect with Victoria even though she was a mean, angry foster child until she met her loving foster mother, Elizabeth.  It was amazing how Victoria changed into someone who was in tune with feelings and something as delicate as flowers because of  Elizabeth.  Elizabeth also had a secret, and the mystery thrown in kept you wondering what had happened in the past.<br />The book became better with each turn of the page.  It was exceptional in terms of writing and storyline.  I enjoyed how smoothly the book went from Victoria's childhood to the present.<br /><br />To me this book stood for unconditional love, for hardship, for talent, for disappointment, and for working for what you really want.<br /><br />I can definitely see why it is being considered the publishing event of 2011......it is indescribably incredible.

B001L1S1SK|4.0|I am a 50 year old male and I just love the show.<br /> Smart writing and good acting, lot's of laughs.<br /> DvD's were in the expected condition. no surprises.<br /> The factory packaging is not the best. I hate it when DvD's touch each other in the box<br /> and that's why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|It's hard to pinpoint what I loved best about this movie - it was all so well done!  The acting, the storyline, the photography, the soundtrack, the overall message...it was all superb!  Movies about actual events are the BEST!! I think audiences crave this - learning how other people react to tragic and heartbreaking events in their lives.  We can all draw something out of this girl's story that we can apply to our own lives and attitudes about our future.  The amazing scenery of Hawaii and the awesome surfing work to make this movie so engaging.  The DVD has a ton of Special Features!!  Check them out!
B00004XQ83|5.0|Purchased this movie for my son in law, who has nearly worn it out watching it again and again. also purchased the sound track for him to listen to while at work. he loves this music so much. we all have enjoyed it again and again. what fun, especially the scene with the frog.

072325804X|5.0|I grew up listening to the stories of Beatrix Potter and loving them.  Now that I'm an adult I still love them and have been buying many copies of this book to give to my friends who are expecting their own children.  The book is of course beautifully written and illustrated and also provides historical information about Beatrix Potter herself, in addition to all of the stories.  It is a wonderful children's classic that every home should own.
B001TOD92C|4.0|While wrestling fans have speculated on who The Wrestler character was based on, and movie critics hailed the career resurrection of Mickey Rourke, the criteria I had for this movie was does it depict wrestling as it is,  or as a cartoon spectacle? Randy 'The Ram ' Robertson was the Hulk Hogan of Aronfskys' world during the eighties crushing the Ayatollah and other eighties evil doers. Now twenty years later, The Ram wrestles on independent shows living in a trailer barely scrounging the rent together and sometimes not making it. Years of steroid abuse have had devastating effects on his body. Still even after a heart attack, he persists wrestling because its' all he knows and it calls him back towards the ring. Even when the Ram tries to build a new life with a young exotic dancer as a butcher at a local deli counter, still the ring calls, a hypnotic call that mortal men of the squared circle can't turn down. The most telling line was when he told his stripper girlfriend. This is where I belong.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|Darren Aronofsky may have provided the source of my nightmares for the next ten years with his hauntingly realistic, yet, beautiful Black Swan. Natalie Portman as Nina plays the talented, yet erratic ballerina who is simply dying to be the Black Swan in a production of Swan Lake. Throughout her career though, she's been viewed as \\"a very nice dancer\\" the prototype for the White Swan. Her artistic director (Vincent Cassel) pushes her outside of her zone of comfort and into the reality of the Black Swan. But merely being pushed to the breaking point isn't quite good enough. She needs to be challenged by a new dancer the dark and mysterious Lilly (Mila Kunis). Challenged by this new, sleek swan, Nina slowly begins to lose control drifting in and out of reality and a fantasy world so blurred even I as the viewer had trouble deciphering between the two. Everything about Black Swan screams methodical and meticulous just like the real life ballet down to the depiction of Beth who can't handle being cast aside for younger dancers and is killed by running in front of a bus. Even the documentary is painstakingly rendered.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|If ever an image sold a product then it was the cover of this dvd! I saw it while perusing Amazom and was instantly drawn to the image of the lone rider on the highway, heading towards the city with all the cars banked up in the other lane! I am so glad I took a chance and bought Season 1 of The Walking Dead, quite simply it is stunning and memorable.I have never been a big fan of zombie movies,sure Night of the living Dead is a great cult movie but the rest of them were more hype than substance! The Walking Dead however is a winner, the production value and special effects are top notch,Andrew Lincoln is a stoic hero and anything that Frank Darabont is mixed up with just has to be good.There are some fantastic television shows coming out of America at the moment,think Breaking Bad,Mad Men and Dexter, its great to see there is more to tv than rehashed police shows that change states but never vary scripts ( hullo CSI!).  Roll on season 2 I can hardly wait!
1933771690|4.0|This is a book I want to read again.  I enjoyed it, and went back and re-read a few sections before I even finished.  Some of the ideas in it are very well presented, and some not so well, and yes, it is soft on the science.  I can't fault it for that, however.  There's a lot going on here, and it's up to the reader to follow up on the pieces that catch his/her fancy.  The point of the book, I think, is to get the reader thinking in a new direction.  I, for one, don't have a solid background in hard science, although I am the sort that picks up and reads pretty much anything so I do have a broad background.  Delving too deeply into the science would have made the book unreadable except to those with the right sort of education -- I don't think that is the only intended audience.  I also found the mini-autobiography that is woven into the text interesting.  I kept waiting for it to tie a bit more securely into the theoretical portion of the text, but that never really happened.  It did break up the mind-bending theorizing, humanize the authors, and perhaps make the book more readable, but it also padded the content to make it look more substantial. It's the sort of book I want to give to my friends just so we can discuss it.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Well first off - I have not received the blu-ray box set yet (yes I went for the complete saga box set)  But reading about the proces of bringing the movies to blu-ray assured me this will be nothing less than the best editions since the LD Ultimate Edition box set.  You may hate or love the alterations (Han shot first!!!!) but the care for the sound on the discs made my inner child chuckle with laughter and for that alone and the two archive discs I will definitely be pleased!
B001AIRUP4|4.0|I generally don't like to watch the same movie again and again, so I don't have much of a video collection.  The exception is for holiday movies.  I consider this to be one of the classics we have to have on hand at the holidays.  It's just so different from the others.  Just in case you haven't seen it, it is animated, of course.  It's whimsical and uplifting -- not just for the kids!
B000002J5K|5.0|This is a nicely produced collection of great tunes! Music I love to listen to over and over. Wonderful selection! I just love their version of The Peter Gunn Theme.
B002GHHHG0|5.0|I truly love the Creepshow 1 and 2 dvds.  Although a little dated they are still a lot of fun for a night of creepy entertainment.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I actually bought this album after hearing her song 'Love the Way You Lie' as the audio part of the trailer for 'Damages'.  I was very impressed with all the songs in Loud.  I still remember that stupid under my umbrella song, and Rihanna has drastically her song writing. Great album at a great price with fast delivery.  I am thrilled.

1891252089|5.0|This is a wonderful practice manual. David Swenson is so inspiring. I love the descriptions of poses and the photos in this book. I'd recommend it to anyone who practices Ashtanga Yoga.
030788743X|1.0|Ok, the wildly positive reviews on Amazon and the blogosphere reeled me in on this one.   Unfortunately, I agree with some of the negative sentiment expressed by others:    1. Beats you over the head with 80's nostalgia, ok we get it, you did a ton of research on pop/geek culture of the time, how nice.  2. Character development fairly shallow  3. No real literary aspirations (I wasn't necessarily looking for a classic here, but still...)  4. Not a ton of strong tech aspirations either (40 years from now people are still emailing and blogging?  Maybe, but I bet something more interesting comes along).   There were a few interesting concepts but nothing genre-bending
B0058OUJA4|3.0|I found ZDefense to be a very fun and well designed iteration of the tower defense genre.  The game offers a good amount of variety with multiple tower types and various enemy types.  The retro style graphics were very polished with fluid animations and very nice special effects (lasers, explosions, etc).  My only gripe with the game, although a significant one, is the sheer difficulty as I found the game to be hard from the beginning and simply frustrating in later levels.  If there are any tower defense junkies looking for a challenge, this would definitely be one to check out.  That said, I do recommend the game, but only to the hardcore tower defense gamer.    As a final note, I seemed to begin losing my network connection at random on my HTC Incredible the day after I installed the app.  I've now unistalled the app and all is back to normal.  It might be just a coincidence, but I would recommend other users of the Incredible to proceed with caution.
0316056863|4.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting.<br />When I saw the cover did I think it was going to be a laugh out loud riot? Yeah...I did.<br />Did I think Tina Fey intelligent, witty, urbane and look to find this in her novel?  Yeah...I did.<br />Do I enjoy the way she makes fun of herself and takes shots at things she finds unjust?  Yeah...I do.<br />Was I surprised to find all of this and more in this novel?<br />Nope...not at all.<br /><br />A great read, this novel was very funny while staying away from being written stand-up.<br />It proselytizes at times, but Ms. Fey does enjoy her perch now and again.  However, she has earned her place as a premiere comic persona with heart.<br />Her stories are poignant and funny and she engages the reader every page.<br />I found this book thoroughly enjoyable and a fast read and recommend it to anyone looking for a little heart with their laughter as well as some self-deprecation.<br />Namaste~
B0051OZ564|1.0|This movie was bad, unfortunately it was not bad enough to be ironically good.    And I will sit through some terrible movies for good action but this didn't have it.
B0045NXMJE|5.0|Funny movie. Good clean fun if you like loveable eccentrics. Hollywood is out of ideas, which is why we see endless remakes. Foreign films provide much needed relief for people like me that love movies but want a fresh story every now and then.<br />Amazon Prime continues to amaze me with fast delivery. They guarantee two day delivery but I often have my orders the next day before I leave for work!

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was an amazing book. It is a bit graphic at times, but it helps paint the picture of what Jaycee's life in captivity was like.
B004G600A4|3.0|Just so you know, most of the good stuff you've already seen in the trailers !  It's a lovely animation & a cute take on the original Rapunzel fable, but it's pretty weak stuff.  They clearly had a hard time filling the 'movie length' category.  Worth a watch, but don't spend too much money for it !
B004529NLG|5.0|Okay, the storyline and acting were not the greatest BUT the dance sequences and the 3D effects are just great!  If you are looking a film that displayes great acting and a very in-depth storyline, pass on this one, it isn't for you.    But, if you are looking for a feel-good movie with awesome dancing sequences and soem REALLY awesome 3D effects (I've NEVER seen anything like this in non-animation movies) then this is the movie for you...  if you are like me and looking to stack your 3D video library, this will be a great addition....
0439023521|4.0|This is an excellent read and I have recommended it to many people, but about halfway through the cover came off and it started to fall apart.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Very well built, and has a few better features.  Got to love the map editor.  Game is not as hard as geodefense, but is pretty darn tough.  I love these type of tower defense games!
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Finally a tower defense games that feels like the first one I played (and still my favorite)  desktop tower defense.  Zdefense does away with a lot of the td gimmicks and let&apos;s you form the most strategic (long)  path for the baddies with just enough variety to make it interesting.  Great game!

B004LZFWJO|5.0|Right now this is my go-to game when I'm bored because it's fun, it's fast, and sounds cute, well except for the sound of the ice cream cone and when you lose.  Graphics are very smooth and swiping is a breeze. I just wish that the other objects looked more like candy.  I mean, gingerbread men are not candy nor cherries, and I don't even know what those blue things are.  I like this game so much that I bought the paid version just to get rid of the ads.
B002OSXDAU|4.0|My favorite dynamics in this novel were Howard's unwavering belief in his unconventional architectural style and the romance between him and Dominique. I saw him as the true starving artist. Well, he did starve at some point since no one would give him a chance after they would take a good look at his sketches. The world around him was not ready for his unconventional creations as they didn't mimic and follow the classic canons of sculpting/architecture. I pictured Dominique as some sort of Greta Garbo character... wearing silk robes and smoking a cigarette from an extension. Dominique and Howard's dialogues are steamy and playful. I thought the author presents Howard himself as a work of art: chiseled body, facial features, just like a sculpture from a slab of granite fresh from the quarry. A bit redundant in the theme of individuality at times. Not a before bed read. It requires lots of concentration as the characters are many and very intricate. So, not ideal if you are looking for a light read.
B004SRNH10|1.0|Take Note:  If you own an LG Optimus V, this app will not install even if it says it is compatible on the product page.  I was very disappointed.  You would think this would have been ironed out by now.
159448385X|5.0|I read this book last year. I could not put it down. I remember feeling grateful for living in a country where women have a voice and choices. Highly recommend it.
0743298039|5.0|I loved this book! It was beautifully written and I was completely engulfed by the story. The characters were interesting, alive and wonderful. I could not put it down. Highly recommended!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|This is absolutely the BEST mini-series I've ever watched.  The acting is superb -- you love the ones you're supposed to love and despise the despicable.  I wish the story had started a little earlier in Henry's life; he was a fascinating man!
B003V1WTMM|4.0|I got this book up at the airport before hopping on my flight, so I didn't think alot about it before my purchase. At first, I found the general flow of the story a little off-putting. To all potential readers: Pay Attention. The story skips around alot (from past to present, character to character, etc.). There were several times when I considered putting it down b/c it was just too much work to read, but I'm glad I didn't. By the time my flight ended and I was about half way through the book, I didn't want to put it down. It is an intriguing tale and you won't regret taking the journey with \\"Edie\\" as she uncovers long-kept secrets and helps set free a family bound by love, tragedy, and the unforgiving passage of time.
006112429X|4.0|This is one of the darkest, most harrowing and horrifying books I've ever read. It's also one of the most brilliantly written and compulsively readable; I couldn't put it down.    There is much discussion regarding the nature-or-nurture question about why Kevin was such a monster. I tend to believe it was innate, and would have come out even if Eva had been the most perfect of mothers. If poor or ambivalent parenting were the sole creator of sociopaths/psychopaths, a whole lot more of us would be killers.    The reasons I didn't give the book five stars: 1) I couldn't quite buy, with all their affluence, why the parents never consulted a specialist or psychologist. Granted, the father was in denial about most of it, but even he had to know there was something dreadfully wrong with a child who isn't toilet trained by six years old. and 2) I couldn't quite buy that any father could be that completely clueless. But those are minor issues in the overall scope of the book, the rich detailing and the incredible shocks the author heaps unflinchingly upon the reader.    I'll say one thing for sure... I have never, EVER been more grateful that I chose not to have children.
B0058OUJA4|4.0|This appears to be  (I'm only a few levels in do fat) a fun and stylish tower defense game.  Challenging, and has more levels to download for free. I dock it a point because it's more than just \\"inspired by\\" the iOS game GeoDefense, it borders on plagiarism. Outside of moral ambiguity though, it's a solid game.
0375703764|5.0|I haven't made a dent into the book yet. But it is starting to get good. Nice size book for a great price.
B001IF252M|5.0|One word: \\"Great!\\" - This is a great adapter. Worth the cost. Better than using plain VGA. Easy and fit connection.
0321687299|4.0|I purchased this when it first came out any only today actual read the book.  I skipped the chapter on Canvas for now.  First, the book is a great introduction.  I intend to read one or two others in the next few days.  It gave me a condensed overview of the philosophy, API's, and sticky spots in HTML5 as of the date of writing (and I realize some has changed since then and a new version can be pre-ordered).  I for one enjoyed the very brief humor when it reared its head -- it was not offensive or mean spirited (and I found it quite clever) so I'm not sure why the the violent reaction by some who have rated this book.  To the contrary, it held my attention through would inevitably be a dry topic.  I value the author's opinions -- this is not a text book.  I value when they are excited or are beaten down by a particular aspect of the spec or it's current implementation.  I do take a small amount of issue with how bogged down the book can become at times with some rather meaty examples (usually around long passages of JavaScript to handle some \\"edge case\\").  If you need a primer to get you up to speed of the major parts of HTML5 without a lot of hands on exercises, but filled with observations from people who seem to know what they're talking about then this book is for you.  That described me -- at least, the me who needed a first pass at the topic matter.  Now, on to a second and subsequent reference for more details.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I wasn't sure of what to expect from this purchase. I compared it to several other name brand photo backpacks. I chose it because of the size and way my bodies and lens would fit in the backpack. I also wanted a plain facade so that it did not stand out to would be thieves. I was astonished to find that I can fit everything into this one backpack. It is organized and well thought out. It fits snug to the body. I am very pleased with my purchase and received it several days before the deadline.
B004BRP7R4|2.0|I am a pretty big Groban fan and eagerly awaited this album.  I wanted to see what he could really do when not partnering with David Foster (directly or indirectly...but with the same \\"Foster\\" sound).  Groban still has a great voice no doubt but this album brings him back down to earth.  As someone who has done a decent amount of studio recording myself you just had to wonder if he was a vocal god or just a really really good singer where the studio production boosted his sound (particularly at mid-levels imho).  This album seems to answer that pretty clearly: Groban is great...but Foster made him a god.    Kudos to Josh for sticking himself out there and not relying so much on production value this time around.  Already looking forward to what's next.
B00428ZRFE|4.0|I absolutely love Rihanna's album Good Girl Gone Bad, but wasn't too impressed by Rated R, so I put off purchasing LOUD until I had heard several of the songs.  ONLY GIRL IN THE WORLD and  S&M are both great upbeat songs.CALIFORNIA KING BED is  a truly beautiful song. It fills me with emotion everytime I listen to it. I also highly recommend a listen to Rihanna's version of the EMINEM hit LOVE THE WAY YOU LIE because it starts off mainly Rihanna and ends with Eminem's vocals. It is a great version of the song.  I am very happy I purchased the entire CD instead of just downloading the \\"popular\\" songs.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I've read all the Nicholas Sparks books and this one was definitely unique. It had a lot of suspense, mystery and intrigue.  I loved all of it until the end. I feel like there may be a part 2, but I doubt it (it's not his style). But if you are a fan...don't miss this one!
B004289ZW0|1.0|I'm a Flight Test Engineer by trade.  IF the GNS 5870 were a piece of equipment in an airliner cockpit, it would be considered non-certifiable per FAR 25.1301(d).  Granted, it's NOT a piece of equipment in an airplane cockpit, but that's where a lot of people who buy this device (myself included) will try to use it. So buyer beware. When I purchased the device, the Bad Elf was all the rage and this really sounded like a better product.  I read the reviews For and Against, including several anecdotal descriptions about a quirky power switch.    Admittedly, I chuckled at the thought of some who idiot couldn't get shut his device off. The day I got the device, I had ZERO problems switching the device on and off.  \\"Swipe On, Swipe Off\\"  I couldn't believe people were having problems simply swiping their finger across the device.  It seemed ridiculously easy.  Call it beginner's luck because the next day after my first flight with the device I had a couple of \\"mis-swipes.\\"  OK, Nothing to be concerned about. I'm sure even the swiftest of finger swipers occasionally need to recalibrate their digits. ---- To digress for a second, in terms of Bluetooth/GPS performance, the until synched instantly with my iPad and to use it with Foreflight HD is a thing of beauty.  It captured a signal quickly, tracked very well and I was wowed.  ----My next flight with the device required a fuel stop. Parked at the pumps, I tried to turn it off and it wouldn't.   10 - 20 - 30 swipes of varying pressures and nada. I took a deep breath, shook out my hand and tried again with a very very light touch - and again - and again and again and still couldn't get it to shut off.  Frustrated, I left the device on while I refueled and dined on my $100 hamburger.  Returning to the plane, I swiped once more - just for the hell of it- and it magically went off.  Of course, now I was getting ready to fly again and needed to turn it back on.  It took me 30 finger swipes to coax it back on. The I flew home and had to turn it off again. Let's not go there.  This frustrating sequence of events now describes every flight on which I attempt to use the GNS 5870.  I've now got over 50 flight hours of use on the thing (and calluses on my fingertips).    This of course assumes that the unit is fully charged.  As difficult as the unit is to turn off, I find that when stowed / transported inside a protective case itself in my flight bag, all it takes is a mosquito fart's worth of pressure to bump the switch, turn the device on and drain the battery just in time for my next flight in IMC.       I must admit, the next point of contention could be true of any bluetooth device.  Using the supplied suction cup holder, I fixed the GNS 5870 to the upper windshield of a C-172 and while flying found that the device spat out some rather interesting EMI that caused my glareshield-mounted magnetic compass to oscillate 30 degrees in each direction.  Relocating the GNS 5870 to a side window eliminates this problem.        Lastly, I've also been unable to acquire a GPS signal whatsoever while flying in the cockpit of transport category airplanes.  This blocking of the GPS signal is generally attributed to these airplane's heated windshield wiring/circuitry.  Interestingly enough, the makers of the XGPS150 bluetooth GPS receiver have issued a firmware update to correct this issue in their device.  This coupled with their device using a revolutionary concept known as \\"The Simple On/Off Button\\" (something the GNS 5870 designers apparently have never heard of) are two reasons why I've just ordered an XGPS150 to replace my GNS 5870.
0345529057|5.0|This is an excellent book set.  The font is a bit small, but it makes the books very portable.  If you already own the books, i would not reccomend buying this to have them again, but if you want to read the series from the start, these are fantastic.
0783229364|1.0|1.  \\"We're not in Kansas anymore\\" uttered practically before the credits are over.  It was already a hackneyed cliche by 1987.<br /><br />2.  Fox's character gets a job because his uncle is the CEO of a major company.  Fox will repay this kindness by betraying his uncle at the end of the movie.  Fox's motivation for turning on his uncle?  That he had an affair with the girl Fox wants.  That Fox had an affair with HIS wife is not important, I guess.<br /><br />3.  Fox's character stalks Helen Slater almost instantly.  Before he knows her name or anything about her, he's following her around and fantasizing about a woman we later find out was hired for her economic genius (more about this in a moment.)  So she's an object, period.<br /><br />4.  Fox's character simply isn't interested in doing the job he was hired to.  Instead he spies on \\"the suits,\\" goes through their mail, and manipulates the system to get himself an office and a secretary he can order to get him supplies and Chinese food.  And then this Fresh out of College kid decides he knows much more than the people with years of business experience, and at no point is he ever proven wrong about anything (a moment of humility, like the one he experiences in \\"Doc Hollywood\\" when he realizes that the Old Country Doctor really does know his stuff, is badly needed here.  Doesn't happen.)<br /><br />5.  Fox's character is sexually harrassed by his aunt.  I mean, there's simply no other way to put it.  Was this kind of crap funny in the 1980s?<br /><br />6.  \\"Brantley Foster\\" is much, much smarter than Helen Slater, who only went to Harvard Business School and has worked at the company for a number of years.  No one has a problem with the portrayal of Slater's character as a dunce compared to the kid from the mailroom?<br /><br />In the end, \\"Brantley Foster\\" gets the girl, gets the job, gets the private jet, and puts his Uncle on the unemployment line.  This is a \\"happy ending.\\"  All that's missing is the \\"80s slow clap\\" to wrap up this cliche-ridden pile of mucus.  Just more evidence that the 1980s were a low point for comedies.ucus.

140131046X|5.0|Ever since \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\", I've tried to read everything that Mitch Albom has written. He has incredible insight into human nature and possesses the ability to string together a story that keeps the reader constantly turning each page well into the night. His books tend to be small, and I've read each one from start to finish in one or two nights. Even though they tend to be easy reads, I'm left thinking about the characters and the story lines for days and weeks afterwards. This is book is no different. I can't wait to see what Mitch will come up with next!
B004ZQRJH2|5.0|I have been an Eminem fan since the MM LP and I own every single major release. I must say that I was disappointed (as most were) with \\"Relapse\\" and although I liked \\"Recovery\\" 1000% better than the former, it still paled in comparison to Em's earlier releases. WELL LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, THE REAL SLIP SHADY HAS JUST STOOD UP! I don't know if it took him getting into the studio with someone from the \\"D\\" that could remind him of his roots or what... All I know is this is the best Eminem album in years. The album is lyrically incredible--Em is ferocious on the mike and Royce definitely holds his own as well. The lyrics are chock-full of  word-play, metaphors, and similes-- True Shady. So many that you will miss most of them if  you are not following along with lyrics in the liner notes.     They way I would describe this record in true Eminem fan terms: Imagine an amalgamation of the Slim Shady LP, and Marshall Mathers Album and then turn the linguistics forward to the year 3000. The flow of both artists absolutely blows my mind, and I'm a true hip-hop head who has seen, heard, felt, and done it all.     GO BUY IT!
B0058OUJA4|3.0|I&apos;ve liked the hex format since I first saw it done in geodefense swarm on ios. That being said, this app brings nothing new to the table and even lacks some of the features that makes the ios original stand out. There are also numerous spelling errors in the tutorial which give the app an unpolished feel.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|movie is great, I've already seen it three times and I don't like to watch movies repeatedly. Can't wait to see what the extra disc has on it.
B000055Y0X|4.0|This picture was released after the Cuban Missile Crisis when the world held it's breathe at the threat of nuclear war and nobody laughed at you if you were building a bunker in your backyard.  The tale is a satire with over the top characters who justify their crazy behavior in, yes, over the top manners.  Peter Seller's recent success in playing multiple characters in LOLITA gets him three roles in this film (U.S. President, RAF second Mandrake and Dr. Strangelove) and arguably his most memorable is as the crippled, queer smiling borderline Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove.  Some of the humor is a bit dated but some of it is still pretty funny to watch.  The complexity of this picture might confuse some viewers.  This film won AFI recognition over several years.  I suspect the ending influenced later media projects like the Fallout video games.  STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus  HUMOR: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; OVERALL GRADE: B.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I heard of this book through upcoming movies on the internet and thought i should see what it is all about. Once i started reading I couldn't stop, this book kept my attention and made me want to read more once it was over. I will not say anything specific about the book b/c their are many that may not have read it but there is good character building and it has a great story that flows real well. I recommend reading this book if you are into a bit of adventure, turmoil, and political rebellion... it was a very satisfying read. As a side not once i read this i had to buy the 2nd book, which is just as good, I will be starting the 3rd once I get a bit free time.
B0048LPRCS|4.0|Some ENTER THE VOID cover blurbs are true. \\"Most mind-blowing\\"? Yes, definitely. \\"Leaves you dazed, elated and absolutely awestruck\\"  Yes and no;  dazed, for sure. \\"Elated\\"? Exactly the opposite. Awestruck means 'reverential respect mixed with fear or wonder'. Fear yes. Wonder involves 'admiration of something beautiful'; so, sort of. Direction and cinematography are unique and excellent; but the subject/theme repugnant.<br /><br />ETV is dark, ghastly, horrific, sordid, vomited images of bloody screaming children, drug-destroyed lost souls and  twisted melting minds. And disturbingly more. All intended to shock and mess with your emotions along with your mind. Mission accomplished.<br /><br />On the one hand VOID could be a great way to dissuade young people from blowing their minds and lives on today's amp'd-up designer drugs, which is a very good thing. On the other hand, it will invade their minds - and yours - with nightmare images of people at their worst (perverse, exploitative, neurotic/psychotic, lost , lazy, stupid) most viewers will struggle to erase. VOID is the most downer movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />I've written many Amazon reviews. This one is the most difficult. I read other reviews to find common themes, but in all, most media reviews - from London, NYC, LA  - took different tacks; mostly un-judgmental relative to the perversities depicted (one straddled the fence with 'perversely inquisitive grace'); choosing to address the film's cinematic technique aspects.<br /><br />All bashing aside, it's an original, extraordinary film. No movie will hit you as hard, teach you so much of life's dark side. Create such conflicting feelings too. It rattled me, as did an earlier film by director  Gaspar Noe, [[ASIN:B0013O123Q Irreversible]]. Images thrill; some prurient, others stunning graphically. Horrors of exploitation, particularly of women, are exotically lit by neon facades of modern-day Tokyo, strobe'd dance clubs; very stylized cinematography, very dramatic. Some ultra exotic facades may've been CGI. There are sailing aerial views of gaudy Tokyo as good as I've ever seen; seemingly seen by the eyes of a departing soul.<br /><br />So that's why, in spite of my great discomfort watching VOID, I give it four stars. All films for all people cover a wide spectrum. Sermonizing sucks just like censorship. Three stars for execution; two for content. Life's full of subjective contradictions, ugly beautiful women, ugly cool men society and fate made that way; which makes VOID true to life, yes?cades may've been CGI.

0738711500|5.0|This book is easy to read as the title suggests.  The book is so well planned. It takes you through all the rules and how to be prepared to what each and every card means. It also gives you advice on taking notes as it states that it helps you memorise each card.  It also contains a chart of the celtic cross and what each position means so that you can always refer to it until you have memorised it.  The Tarot Cards are absolutely beautiful to look at and they feel so comfortable.  They in fact make you want to interpret them. I have only just started again to teach myself and I have absolutely found the right way with this book and cards.  The book gives lots of encouragement which is terrific to a beginner.
B000T05R90|3.0|Piper was Pink Floyd's debut album and it really shows. There is a very simplistic, almost amateurish quality to the songs, Astronomy Domine being the only exception. About half the songs on this album are very simple and aimed at a younger audience, and by younger I mean ages 3 to 8! Unicorns, gnomes, \\"oh mother, tell me more\\"...it was all just a bit too hokey and childish to me. The biggest disappointment on this album was Interstellar Overdrive. What should have been a cool, psychedelic track in the same vein of Astronomy Domine, ended up dissolving into a chaotic noisy wreck. In finality, I will say that this album is still a decent listen, and if fairytale-ish tunes are your cup of tea then you will be thoroughly satisfied. This was just ok for me, not something I will listen to often.    6/10
B004LUS390|5.0|if im nowhere near my photoshop, this app is my standby. its well flourished, solid, responsive, and very easy to use. the UI is a stroke of genius that other like apps should take notice of. coupled with a stylus, and any artist is in art heaven on their droid. some of the best money ive spent on an app!
B000002U9Y|5.0|Like \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\", this is another album I can listen to and not have to skip over any track.   All the songs are very well done and musically creative. This album represents a vast improvement over their debut album, \\"Piper  At The Gates of Dawn\\". While their debut album focused more on childish, whimsical, fairy tale music (the kind of music you'd expect to hear on childrens' TV programming, Puff the Magic Dragon anyone?), their second album contains more actual music. I don't fully understand the hype that surrounds Syd Barret. There were plenty of acid dropping artists and singers during those days and he certainly wasn't the most talented among them.     Overall, this is Pink Floyd's best album from the early years (1967-1970).  It's a must have for any Floyd fan, and for any fan of late 60's era music.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow! That's all I can say. I absolutely loved this book and although it had an unexpected ending, I still thought it fit the story to a T. Fantastic. This series is the absolute best set of books I have read in a long, long, long time.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game. I hope they come out with another! easily worth $15.00 or more! but its only $2.99! You already made the investment in your phone, might as well buy this game and really enjoy your smartphone!
B0058OUJA4|3.0|The game is quite fun but it tends to be too difficult. Even on easy the creeps will go through 20+ upgraded towers. Stresses me out!
B003YWUTKM|3.0|David Gilmour is definitely noticed on the album, but it is clear that they didnt write an album together. Instead, they recorded a jam session and made an electronic album with Gilmour's guitar parts dubbed over it. Also, there are only 2 tracks on the disc with each track being 20-30 minutes long. But there are several \\"songs\\" within each track. I personally think the CD would be more enjoyable if they would've separated the tracks.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Awesome game.  Simple yet hard, gorgeous graphics. Staying up when I should be sleeping. Not paying attention to girlfriend. Oops.
B001C4Z6SE|5.0|David Gilmour and Rick Wright perform with several Pink Floyd collaborators including long time group saxophonist, Dick Parry. The group performs \\"On an Island\\" in it's entirety as well as a second set of classic Floyd songs and a couple of more rare tracks - my favorite being \\"Fat Old Sun.\\" Unfortunately, another rare song, \\"Wot's... Uh the Deal,\\" is not included on this version of the album. But the production is excellent. In my opinion, David Gilmour is one of the greatest guitarists in rock history and he delivers an amazing performance on \\"Live in Gdansk.\\"
B003L77GRO|4.0|I love this show.. I really do and this season didn't get me as much as the other 4. I am very excited to see what season 6 has in store since he says \\"he has been getting back to his old self\\". Which is good, I feel like all his loves never work out and it makes me kind of mad since he tries so hard to have a normal life and it never works out with girls. I guess that is the plot though. But I think that season 6 will be better! So don't give up fans!
B000VZUWZW|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE The Big Bang Theory - our family has added several \\"Sheldonisms\\" to our regular vocabulary! Most notable is when we're irritated with someone, we'll shout out \\"WHEEEEEATOOOOONNNNN\\". The humor, intelligent humor mind you is priceless and the timing of all the actors is similar to the old spot on performances of Lucille Ball and her ensemble in \\"I Love Lucy\\". This is also one of very few shows that I don't mind watching reruns of. Amazon - please bring Big Bang to the Prime Streaming!
B004QK5N5W|4.0|I've enjoyed this adapter enough to buy two of them--one for home and one for work--as well as consider a third for travel, but there are a couple problems that keeps me from fully enjoying it.    The short cable is consequently stiff and makes the overall device a bit unwieldy. I pass mine through a binder clip's handles with the clip on a raised platform in order to have the phone upright and controls visible and accessible when playing to a monitor. At home, it is secured via a twist-tie to hold it upright against a desk's leg. I use a right-angle adapter to the HDMI port to be able to manage the HDMI cable as well. I'd love to use it with the Apple iPhone 4 Dock (model A1353) instead so I could have the device at a useful angle and the cable sticking out the back flat on the table, but for some reason that dock blocks the HDMI adapter cable from being recognized by the iPhone 4 or iPod touch (though charging still works). Apple needs to produce a new cradle that works with this or have this adapter be itself a cradle. (It's also a shame that most cradles can't accommodate cases.)    It would also be nice if it had the option to run a display at its native resolution and let the video be framed in black. There are 1600x900 LCD monitors that are cheaper than 1280x720 LCD HDTVs (and even those may really be 1366 +/- 2 x 768 displays), but the scaling-up of the 720p output can have a blurring effect on the screen.    Despite these gripes, for long duration viewing, the pass-through charging connection is essential. I would not use any other cable that lacked that.

140053271X|5.0|In full disclosure this is the first e-ink reader I have ever owned.  That being said, I've heard complaints from others about older models and have people at work compare their kindles to my nook touch and they think mine is sweet.  For me the size is perfect and once you play around with it, it is very easy to navigate.  It only has wi fi and no 3G but that may not matter to some.  I'm very happy with it so far and my only real complaint is that the B&N accessories are a little on the high side.  I mean really, you're paying 140 bucks for the reader, you shouldn't have to shell out $30 for a case.  Other than that, I think it's really cool and it doesn't have any of the web browser/mp3 nonsense on it that sucks anyway on e readers.  If you're on the fence regarding e readers, go with this one and help keep book stores alive!!!
0375703764|5.0|How many novels out there have multiple stories, illustrations, journal entries, and visual representations of the written text USING that text, all tucked away between the same front and back cover? If you're looking for something to browse through on weekends, or to occupy your time on a flight, keep looking. If you're looking for a work you've probably never seen the likes of before, that will keep you hooked, dumbfounded, and possibly afraid until the very end, where you'll be tempted to start it all over again anyway, then stop reading this review and try \\"House of Leaves\\" for yourself. Top notch stuff!
B004SUDQ8Q|4.0|This movie touches on a topic that may not be known by many people.  You are taken on an emotional journey and while this may be a slow pace for those who are used to action packed films, holds the power of a movie like Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile.  Definitely worth watching.
B004SB60OC|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter.  She was very happy to receive this and I'm happy I can put the album on my ipod too.
B000A88EVE|1.0|I tried to watch this film a few years ago and was bored to tears so I quit about half way through. I ended up reading the book instead and really liked it. So I decided to revisit the movie and watched the whole thing. I'm afraid my initial impression was correct- it is really boring, and also frustrating to watch. It took the interesting straightforward narrative of the book and made it very confusing when it didn't have to be- a few simple scenes of clarification would have done wonders for the plot. If I hadn't read the book, I would have been lost. I also thought the sex and nudity which were not in the book were gratuitous and distracting. The book wisely made the alien nonsexual, but the movie had him sexually involved with Candy Clarke's character. The scene were he finally strips nude sans nipples, fingernails, contacts and apparently his penis and tries to have alien sex- whatever that is, the movie implied some kind of full body splooge fest- was pretty ridiculous. As was the scene where he rekindles his relationship with her, apparently with his fully functional prosthetic penis back in place. Bowie's acting was fine, he was after all, born to play an alien- but Candy Clarke and Rip Torn were both terrible, and their characters were both grating and unsympathetic. The make up to age them was also really bad. Buck Henry was probably the most interesting supporting character, but the scene where he and his partner were thrown from a window was also ridiculous and made no sense in the plot of the film.     Any reviewer that gives this film a high rating I question their planet of origin. If you're from the planet earth, my prediction is you'll also dislike this film. Read the book instead.

B005DI66N4|2.0|This is a highly praised story of a polish army guy in the late 1930's who gets dragged off to a Northern Siberian Gulag. He and a half dozen of his friends decide they must escape. With a little bit of help (not much) they manage to get out in the latter portion of the Siberian winter, walk down to Mongolia, trek across the Gobi desert, hump through Tibet (the Himalayas), and find safety in India. It's an amazing story of endurance--so amazing that I could not wrap my brain around some parts. The vastness and coldness of Siberia is difficult to imagine. The Gobi, however, struck me as the true high point of the feat, sometimes forcing them to go 12 days without water. (Can you do that in a desert?) The description of help by Mongolians and Tibetans is heartwarming. The ordeal was clearly grueling. As always, I scampered over to Amazon to check out what other reviewers had to say, especially the rare one-star reviewers. So here was this one star reviewer (Steve Dunn, the top one) who basically screams, \\"Bull!\\" What was noticeable is that there were 29 comments to his review, which I presumed to be varying forms of excoriation of poor Steve. Au contraire. They concurred that it simply did not pass the smell test. My son admitted that he read it with an open heart and didn't challenge the facts. However, he got the recommendation from a veteran of Himalayan climber. It will be interesting to see if, when prodded, the guy begins to doubt the tail.    In general, I find some of these endurance books seem to push the story past the point of fact. (I am reminded of Lone Survivor, in which I found way too much bravado to buy into the story.) My son is currently listening to a book about Hemingway. Supposedly, Dirty Ernie says that all authors are liars; the fiction writers are simply more flamboyantly.

B001TK3XO0|5.0|An amazing read, dark subject matter like the Kite Runner but marvelously written. It is better in my opinion than the Kite Runner this is a very well written book.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|There is a very serious subject in this movie but I just love it.  I've never seen Shirly Mclain better nor Jack Lemon.  He reminds me of my dad and I just love Jack's movies.  To me, this is at the top of the list of his movies.
0062060554|5.0|I will just say wow, this is an amazing book that I had to read in one day, I couldn't put it down.  There are enough other reviews that give you the plot.  I just had to stick in my two cents and say that I thought it was hold your breath good.
B003L77GRY|3.0|I will preface my review of Dexter: Season 5 with some necessary explanations.   First, I did not buy this product from Amazon, so I cannot comment on shipping, ordering, etc.  Secondly, I have only watched the episodes, and so I will not comment on the extra features.   Lastly, this review has some spoilers. So, if you do not wish to know anything about what happens, do yourself a favor and quit reading.    Let's begin with a discussion of the first episode. Fans of the series know all about the cliffhanger at the end of season 4. Unfortunately for me, I had turned on my television the day after the season finale to see ubiquitous interviews with Julie Benz discussing the episode, in detail. So, you can imagine my mindset at the beginning of season 5.   One of the many foibles working against my opinion of this season is the fact that Dexter's inevitable return to equilibrium takes an agonizingly long two episodes. Some may argue that this creative choice reflects the character's reaction to profound grief. With a season of only 12 episodes, I believe it was essential to be more concise in Dexter's handling of the aforementioned cliffhanger.  I won't take long to explain my willing suspension of disbelief, suffice it to say that I had to really, really try with this season. After watching every episode, I can say there were some obvious plot holes and inexplicable choices that seemed to go against the very nature of some of the characters.    After ruminating on this season, I can't complain about the guest stars. Other reviewers have expressed their displeasure at Julia Stiles' performance, but I did not find her as dissatisfactory as others reviewers did.   Aside from Dexter, the sub-plots of the supporting cast are consequences of the previous season. So, dear reader, you will pick up right where you left off. While the sub-plots are intriguing, they will always play second fiddle to the season-long narrative.    My only attitude towards the over-arching plot isthis: for fans of the series who have continued to read my review, you can expect a mash-up of seasons two and three. To say the least, the plot structure of the season will feel familiar.  While another season of Dexter is a good thing, I did not feel the same sense of grotesque curiosity I felt when I first watched season 1. Perhaps I am becoming accustomed to the nuances of this series, but that only means that the writers should be working harder to rectify my emotional indifference.     I guess I'll close with the acknowledgment that if you're a fan of this series, what I say won't matter, and that you've probably already picked this one up. However, if you are only a casual fan, I begrudgingly recommend that you rent this season before you buy. In this economy, spending more than $40 for this product is not something I can condone (even if it is in hi-def).
B00005T30L|5.0|I love this movie.  This is for fans of Heathers, Mean Girls, and the like.  I wish the director would make more movies like this.  Seymour rules!!

B003Y5H5A6|4.0|When i first heard that they were making a captain america movie, I was both excited and worried. Marvel had already let me down with my favorite hero, wolverine, that I was nervous that they would destroy my second favorite. But as more screens and trailers began to arrive, I was excited that Steve Rogers would be given the movie treatment that his character deserves. I can say that overall this was a great superhero movie that captured the greatness that Captain America represents. I'd give this movie a 4.5/5 if I could. I had to go to the low-end on Amazon with a 4/5 because to me the movies biggest weakness is the incredibly under-developed red skull who is a much more terrifying and complex villian than the movie could produce. I do give Hugo weaving credit for what he was able to do with the character though.    Regardless this movie was excellant and it has me pumped for The Avengers coming out next year.
0920668372|5.0|This is a great book that has a lot of meaning to me, and many other people i'm sure. I recommend it for people of all ages to read!

B0012GVKVY|5.0|I strongly recommend this blue ray, it looks really great, also is a great movie. sci-fi on hi def is the best!!!
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|I love the concept here but mine was defective. Sent two e-mails to Mobee and got no answer. They have zero customer support. I finally found a document on their site that described my problem and listed it as defective. I just got a refund as I did not want to mess with another defective one. I just rotate rechargeables AAs out of a wall unit.
6305428042|5.0|What can I say about 'Hocus Pocus'? Only that it has been a movie that I watch not only every October, but every other time of the year when I'm feeling sad, happy, or just really nostalgic. And I don't know what's taken me so long to get the DVD, because for the past 10 years or so I've been watching the old VHS tape that I recorded from 1998 (which I will still keep of course because it has the old Disney Channel commercials- oh, sweet nostalgia), but I guess better late then never. And although I don't know what person in their right mind could not like this movie, I know that there are some people out there who pick on it because it was a box office flop with a campy/corny atmosphere making it incapable of being a quality movie. And the critic ridicule is completely justified because all of those things are true. But the fact of the matter is...I DON'T CARE! And neither should anyone else. I will defend this movie till the bitter end because it was a viable part of my childhood, and reminds me of a time when life wasn't quite so complicated, and I still believed in magic, and Halloween was one of the best times of the year. So if you haven't seen this movie, (But honestly, who hasn't seen this movie by now? The 20th anniversary (2013) is just around the corner for crying out loud...)DO NOT listen to the critics! Watch it because it is a fun Halloween movie that will entertain you for about 90 min or so and may just take you back to your own childhood memories of Halloween. Like I said, I don't like this movie, I love it.<br />P.S The order came on the estimated delivery date. Good job Amazon!
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|I am a huge fan of Pink Floyd, and this disc does not disappoint. It has all the usual Floyd songs as well as some of Gilmour's solo CDs. A worthy addition to any Floyd collector's collection.

0316098329|5.0|I was debating on whether or not I wanted to read this, so I took a chance. I couldn't put it down I read it from cover to cover in a day and a half. I love how its told from a five-year-olds perspective. You as the reader knows what going on, but the narrator doesn't. Such a clever touch.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game. it will make you waste your entire day. turn off the music but leave the sound effects of the slice.
0767827902|3.0|the original version was much longer and had no censorship of the nude episodes, It also showed hoow this young man, with the help of the concessions lady repaired the theater and tge  projector and began to  run a successful theateer whiich made some profits.  This DVD heavely censored the nude scenes and fore shortened the movie so it made no sense. A very reprehensive act.
0316069353|4.0|After reading some of the other reviews, I do agree that \\"The Fifth Witness\\" is long, lacks a lot of excitement, and contains a scientific courtroom piece that should have been shortened.  However, as a courtroom drama, it is well-researched and well- written.  Michael Connelly is such an accomplished writer that he is able to overcome the limitations of a story that occurs mostly in the courtroom.  It is a well-done drama with an engaging storyline that held my interest throughout.
B0058OUJA4|3.0|The reason being,  it is.  I received a message upon trying to install &quot;you already have zdefense installed&quot;  After uninstalling hex defense,  this installed without issue.    I sure hope the same development shop just changed the name,  or someone is going to get sued.
B000INAXGU|5.0|Simply put, if you are looking for the best of Jamiroquai, look no further. A very enjoyable album throughout. This album has most of the hits you may already be familiar with such as Virtual Insanity and Canned Heat (which was made famous by the dance scene in Napoleon Dynamite). Other gems like 'Little L' and 'Feels Just Like It Should' may be a pleasant surprise to new fans. A must have for a Jamiroquai fan on the budget.
B003Y5H542|5.0|Great movie for the whole family. Great price for the blu-ray dvd combo. Johnny Deep is great as Rango and plus all the other voice overs went well. Must see.
B004VQUX42|5.0|Prompt delivery and was as described.  Would order again from this vendor.  Friend insisted on a hardback version of this book even though available on E-Books
B002NXSRVG|2.0|My review makes sense only if you know the type of person I am:<br /><br />Loud noises bother me, even though I'm a musician.  I'm not easily distracted by shiny objects.  Hot girls in movies do nothing for me, because they're not real---they're freaking pictures, for crying out loud.  Might as well go masturbate to a stick figure drawn in a cave 10000 years ago, for all the good it'll do you.<br /><br />I'm a child of the 80s, so I grew up on GI Joe.  Still, one look at the cover, and I knew what this movie would be all about: loud explosions, jerky camera movement, and hot girls.<br /><br />In that regard, this movie delivered in spades.<br /><br />If you're like me, though, you won't like this movie at all.  The plot is stupid and the dialogue is very thin.  I mean, they might as well have just gotten some old GI Joe action figures and moved em around with their hands, having just 2 or 3 people saying all the dialogue.  At least this way, it would feel right: it's like this movie was written by a group of seven-year old children.<br /><br />I don't remember much \\"canon\\" from the GI Joe cartoon, so it's not like I care about accuracy.  But I do remember a lot of humor from the cartoon, and that sense of humor is totally gone here.  Instead, you get BOOBS!  Oh wow, BOOBS!  I'm, like, a SIXTH GRADER!  And WOW, there's BOOBS!<br /><br />Have fun.
0143117009|2.0|Prof Diamond can be a really good writer. I enjoyed the chapters on the Maya, Easter Island and the Vikings. I thought the Rwanda chapter was excellent. To be honest I found the beginning and end of the book a lecturey dirge.    But there are so many things to pick up on. The Easter Islanders were not isolated - after all how did the sweet potato spread into Polynesia from south America if not through Easter Island? Easter Island probably had some (trade?) connections to South America until the Inca Empire (understandably) collapsed in the 16th century.    Next, the Maya were not isolated. They had trade links notably with Mexico to the NW but also with Guatemala to the SE. The collapse of high culture in Yucatan was not a failure of agriculture - people concentrated in different parts of the Yucatan peninsula at different times as a result of changing trade, technologies and trade routes. Ultimately, technology made any trade route through the peninsula superfluous.    Lastly, the Vikings of Greenland were not isolated, but were a connected part of the Scandinavian world, exporting furs (as even Prof Diamond acknowledges). They probably packed up and went home because the weather, for various reasons, no-longer made it possible to keep that trade going (and I do pity the few poor blighters they left behind). What's a wonder is that Iceland's society didn't give up the ghost at the same time.    By failing to recognise the connectedness of past societies it's easy to make out that they were destined to implode due to their isolation. That makes it look like a really good analogy for the global food crisis that we're in. But it's not a good analogy, it's just wrong. A better analogy would draw would be just how bad the effects of an international economic crisis can be in making people behave disgracefully as they go down.
B0052FG8KO|5.0|Work Of Art have returned for their highly anticipated second album titled In Progress and it is yet another superb example of high quality melodic rock. These guys play a style of music that is very reminiscent of what Toto were doing on classic albums like Farenheight and The Seventh One. Their songs are simply amazing combining elements such as smooth and memorable vocal melodies, great guitar solos, lively performances, and killer production. The whole album is very strong but some highlights include the cracking opening track \\"The Rain\\", the hook laden chorus of \\"Nature Of The Game\\", the awesome keyboards of \\"Never Love Again\\", and the brilliant guitar riffs and memorable chorus of \\"Emelie\\". The music on In Progress is probably as close as you're going to get to the awesome sound that Toto owned back in the late eighties and is easily a top 5 album in a very strong year for melodic rock releases. In Progress is essential listening for anyone that loved the first Work Of Art album and is highly recommended to fans of intense melodic rock. Take one part Toto DNA and mix with crystal clear production and memorable melodies and you get In Progress!
B005BRS8Z6|1.0|I chose not to buy this book when it first came out because I suspected it wouldn't go much deeper than the table of contents.  After hearing good things about it, and distracted by the colorful cover, I finally bought it.  I was right, it was a waste of money.  The writing style is patronizing and it's just poorly written.  It's like four \\"good ideas\\" that the author decided to flesh out into a book.  But there's no flesh in this thing, only fluff.  Ideas are regurgitated in different sentence form just to bulk up the paragraphs, until you feel like you are reading a high school essay.  I'm in the middle of the 3rd agreement at the moment, and I don't think I'm going to be able to finish the book.
B004XQO90E|4.0|Like an action version of \\"Ground Hog Day\\" Duncan Jones' \\"Source Code\\" offers action and suspense in a clever way. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in sci-fi.

B004K8WPUQ|5.0|I've previously shot interviews at California wine tasting events with the wonderful Sony PD170 SD camcorder and Azden pro audio.  I loved the control with the pro gear but it is time to move on to HD and I decided to experiment with a Sony Handycam HDR-CX360.      My Azden audio equipment doesn't work with the Sony Handycam for some reason.  There is static and humming.  I need a shotgun mic so I read the mixed reviews of the Rode models and went with the Pro.    We experimented at home with the stereo turned up and the results were poor.  It didn't seem like much of a shotgun but there was no time to figure out another solution before the huge Family Winemakers of California tasting event at Fort Mason in San Francisco.    The noise created by a couple thousand wine drinking attendees and winery staff in that old military warehouse pier is a nightmare for audio.  The ambient noise is a constant din that makes conversation challenging.  I was standing only a few feet away shooting and could barely hear my wife asking the questions and the winery staff answering her.      After a couple of interviews we went outside to review them with the camcorder review function and the audio sounded at least salvageable with the camcorder speakers.  We shot for the next few hours and hoped for the best.  I didn't shoot with headphones because my Sony Studio Monitor set is too loud with this camcorder.    The Rode Pro did fantastic and equaled my big pro audio gear with a 16\\" shotgun mic.  In the videos you can clearly hear my wife and the interviewee.  I would say that the improvement over actually being there is maybe 3x better.  Other than an erupting volcano or a battle I'm not aware of a bigger audio recording challenge.    I was shooting with the camcorder and Rode on a handheld stabilization rig with the Rode about 6\\" from the camera and mounted on a cold shoe on the DV Multirig.  I had a Japanese camcorder on an Israeli stabilization rig with an Aussie mic at a Californiaevent :-)    We will soon be posting these interviews on WineQuesters.com.  You can compare them with the older SD videos of tasting events in the Videos section.  Use the search feature to find wineries we interviewed using the Rode such as Clos Pepe, Cornerstone, Delectus, or B Cellars. I could probably make some improvements to the audio in post processing but there is no time for that with these short clips.  We shoot run and gun and achieved the quality we need under the circumstances.
B001IF252M|4.0|Works fine, but shouldn't need it - most PC's have HDMI and VGA out, so this piece is just a money maker for Apple.  But it works great, great pic quality and one benefit is that you can leave the VGA cord screwed in and just unplug this easily.  It stays snug in the Mac.
034552554X|5.0|This novel was absolutely wonderful.  Beautiful prose, and an equally beautiful story.  The central character, Victoria, was abandoned at birth and spent her entire childhood in the foster care system.  At the age of 18, she is emancipated and pretty much thrown out into the world, completely unprepared, to make her own way.<br /><br />I read many books that are so rife with cultural references that you have to be a certain age to get.  This is not one of those books.  I can wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good, heartwarming story.  This is a story that my mother would enjoy, as well as my 13 and 14 year old daughters.<br /><br />This is such a gut wrenching and heartwarming story.  You want things to work out for Victoria, but at times, it simply seems impossible.  She is afraid to trust, afraid to find herself relying on others and apparently completely unable to love.  Through a series of flashbacks, we are also shown how she came to she see herself as totally unworthy of anyone else's love or trust.  As her upbringing severely stunted the development of social skills, the only way she is able to effectively communicate is through flowers, a language which, sadly hardly anyone understands.  There are several other characters in the story who try to connect with Victoria, all deeply scarred by their own emotional baggage.  It was absorbing to watch them tentatively reach out to each other, desperate for and at the same time terrified of connecting with someone else.<br /><br />As I was reading, there were many instances where Victoria made decisions that I found completely illogical, until I realized I was projecting my own background of coming from a loving family.  Victoria never had that, and if that variable were taken out of my life, I have no way of knowing how I might have reacted in similar situations, much less what kind of a person I would have grown into.<br /><br />(I won an advanced reader's edition of this book in a random drawing back in June, but as it was not through the Amazon Vine program, which I am not a part of, I was not able to post a review until now.)was not through the Amazon Vine program, which I am not a part of, I was not able to post a review until now.)

B0058OUJA4|5.0|Alright, we loved HexDefense. But there was no tutorial. There were limited levels to beat. The UI was confusing. We were all pining for updates with new levels.  So why our our panties bunched thinking this is a rip off? This is our ANSWER to hex defense... a well designed game that will actually keep us playing, with downloadable levels, rather than something we can beat in one day. kudos, zdefense. hexdefense was a copy in the first place, anyway
B005BGBPBG|1.0|Movie was long and boring. Story line is totally lame. How could they make a movie about cheating on your best friend's fiance? Totally wrong
0307946711|5.0|I find the story so engrossing from the beginning pages. Until Chapter 18. Wow, David Nicholls should have ended it there. It's not what I expected. I'm one of those readers who did not find the continuing saga of Dex's amorous affairs worth going through. I'm a man, but my heart is with Em... she should have been allowed to bloom! But really, David Nicholls is a very good author.
B004G6009U|5.0|This show is fun for children and adults as well.  I first got it from Netflix to see if I liked it.  I liked it so much that I decided I wanted a copy on my library.  It is a cute version of the story of Rapunzel.
B005GRWQEU|5.0|Love all the songs on this CD. Kudos to Alan & Marilyn Bergman for composing these beautiful songs and Ms. Barbra Streisand for her lovely interpretation.
B000001A6F|5.0|From the moment I first heard this album,I instantly realized from it's opening it was one of those recordings like no other. There are many in pop. All come from many past sources but all have something called innovation. After his huge change in contract with Motown,guaranteeing full creative control of his music Stevie was now officially a responsible adult. So much was changing for Stevie in 1972 as well. His marriage to Syreeta Wright had broken up during this same time. Not only that he'd become involved with  Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff and their unique synthesizer complex TONTO,a major technological innovation of the day. Always one of the strongest melodicists at Motown Stevie was intent on utilizing the new technologies of synthesized instruments to create new ways of making sounds. While he wanted to keep his songwriting style somewhat the same. Well he created his new sounds. But something new did happen to his music as well. [[ASIN:B000001AET Where I'm Coming From]] for sure had made it clear he was re-harmonizing his songwriting. On here that went to a whole other level.<br /><br />  One of the most fascinating things about this album is not only the captivating electronic melodies and harmonizing effects Stevie is starting to render with TONTO but also the funkiness he gets out of it. \\"Love Having You Around\\" comes at hard driving funk from the perspective of blues from the future-with it's vocoder use and fuzzed rhodes piano it sort of predates some of what Roger Troutman would do a decade later. Having one of his five senses absent Stevie's sense of feeling is more enhanced so on this album he's both musically and lyrically feeling the end of his marriage. \\"Superwoman\\" deals with this well of course,turning from  fairly contemporary mid-tempo soul to this jazz-fusion style finale \\"Where Were You When I Need You\\". \\"Girl Blue\\" is a very complex song musically,combining this wonderful latin styled percussion with an unusually reverbed vocal. Again a similar psycho analytical approach to the reasons relationships fade away. He has plenty of room for happiness to on \\"Happier Than The Morning Sun\\",one of his most texturally beautiful clavinet-done-harpsichord style ballads as well as one his strongest overal compositions.<br /><br />  \\"Sweet Little Girl\\" is the song that reaches more towards the blues than most of the songs on the album. By the end of the song Stevie is wittily pursuing a female companion,finally admitting that he loves her more than his clavinet and will even \\"put his harmonica down\\". \\"Keeping On Running\\" is very much fast paced,highly danceable funk very much in league of [[ASIN:0790743752 Shaft]] era Isaac Hayes,only the clavinet taking over for wah wah and the song having a rhythm have a somewhat more unusual time signature. \\"Seems So Long\\" had this psychedelic jazz-fusion ballad flavor to it,with one of Wonder's most longing lyrics. As for the closer \\"Evil\\"? Well,it's one of those slow numbers that really makes one wonder about how warped our society is about expressing and feeling caring emotions. Probably not one of those albums one can fully absorb in one sitting,it also serves as the first creative burst in what turned out to be many Stevie would experience in the next few years.

Again a similar psycho analytical approach to the reasons relationships fade away. He has plenty of room for happiness to on \\"Happier Than The Morning Sun\\",one of his most texturally beautiful clavinet-done-harpsichord style ballads as well as one his strongest overal compositions.                                \\"Sweet Little Girl\\" is the song that reaches more towards the blues than most of the songs on the album. By the end of the song Stevie is wittily pursuing a female companion,finally admitting that he loves her more than his clavinet and will even \\"put his harmonica down\\". \\"Keeping On Running\\" is very much fast paced,highly danceable funk very much in league of [[ASIN:0790743752 Shaft]] era Isaac Hayes,only the clavinet taking over for wah wah and the song having a rhythm have a somewhat more unusual time signature. \\"Seems So Long\\" had this psychedelic jazz-fusion ballad flavor to it,with one of Wonder's most longing lyrics. As for the closer \\"Evil\\"? Well,it's one of those slow numbers that really makes one wonder about how warped our society is about expressing and feeling caring emotions. Probably not one of those albums one can fully absorb in one sitting,it also serves as the first creative burst in what turned out to be many Stevie would experience in the next few years. He would gradually refine and even commercialize this sound by degrees during this time. But honestly he never quite expressed himself in such a purely creative sense until the end of the 70's decade.
B0058A119G|4.0|Sometimes, I'm really happy to be wrong. In 2009, when barbra released \\"Love is the Answer\\" I thought it was her finest collection of songs since \\"The Broadway Album\\", and like most, I prefer the quartet versions. I thought, particularly after the album reached #1, it should be her last--go out on a high note. When she announced that she was recording another studio album, especially an album completely devoted to the Bergman's who she's already recorded very extensively throughout her career, I thought, \\"Oh, God! This is gonna suck.\\" I am VERY happy to say, I was wrong, wrong, wrong.    The last several years have seen Barbra on a dizzying creative high, and this album, like her last, is essential 'late period Barbra.' It is her finest album with full orchestra since \\"The Broadway Album.\\" Every detail of the album is handled with loving care, and the utmost respect. The arrangements are lush, but not laboring or overbearing, and barbra is in better voice than she has been in years--there is a little rasp in her belt, but at 69, she still hasn't developed the \\"wobble\\" thank goodness, and she still manages to make this rather intricate, rangy melodies seem almost effortless.     For those who stopped buying barbra Streisand albums after 1997's \\"Higher Ground\\" they're losing out. I highly reccommend who reads this to purchase this album--as well as \\"Live in Concert 2006\\" and \\"Love is the Answer\\" if you haven't already. You won't be sorry. This album is a beavenly bubble bath that stays the perfect temperature from its first syllable to its last.    Download This: Windmills of Your Mind
B00000IUT7|3.0|My son was very excited to receive this train engine but we had to send it back.  To insert the batteries you need a very long and thin screwdriver to get into the deep hole where the small screw is.  Nothing we had worked, the screw was in very tight and we could not get the battery compartment open.  We had to send it back, and he settled for a Thomas brand engine instead (which worked just as well and was a little less expensive.)
B000Q66JXA|1.0|I have seen this movie on Laserdisc and was very eager to see it on Bluray.  I was shocked when I began watching.  I was completely amazed at the noise visible.  Every chapter was the same.  In fact there was so much digital noise that it proved totally unwatchable.  I believe the transfer was a complete failure.  If it was due to the wear and tear of the original negative or if the transfer wasn't even taken from the original I don't know, but it just wasn't worth the money.  I'd avoid it on Bluray.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. I got way more than i expected before I started reading. Once I got into the book I knew it was going to be something good but it just kept getting better in it's own twisted way. The end leaves you wanting more but...  I don't know if I am going to read the next in the trilogy because I don't know how it could get any better but I guess i will read the reviews and see.

0071762345|5.0|Social media is the hottest topic in marketing these days. Many marketers are rushing to implement campaigns on social media for their companies or clients, pushed by CEOs whose only thinking is \\"We gotta do social media\\" without really know what these are about. And for a pretty brand-new field like this is, there's space for many people to show up and market themselves as social media marketing experts or \\"guru\\". However, how many of these people are real experts and how many instead are just trying to sell a service without really know the potential value. Maybe it's hard to answer this question, but I can tell that Dave Kerpen, author of \\"Likeable Social Media\\", is definitely a real expert in this field. Why do I argue this? Because in 223 pages + appendix, he gives a complete round-up of the concepts that make social media so unique and revolutionary compared to the traditional channels of communications. As Dave says in the introduction, \\"While social media sites and tools will change with every week that goes by, the 18 strategies discussed in this book will remain the same and help you utilize social media to become more transparent, responsive, engaging, and profitable\\".<br /><br />What I think that makes this book stand out from other writings on social media, it's also the ability of the author to make people understand the topic with an easy and entertaining language. I would recommend this book to anyone approaching the exciting world of social media marketing. Also, it's a great book for marketers with more experience in the field, who need to refresh the basic concepts of the topic.<br /><br />The book is available to purchase on Amazon. Also, I recommend to check out the Likeable Media blog posts, great daily source of interesting content and tips by Dave Kerpen and his social media team.<br /><br />Enjoy the reading!
1934429376|5.0|The illustrations are full pages and in color. Definitely a must have for any golden books fans, art lovers, illustrators, artists, you name it. I love vintage myself, and it has a wonderful showcase of Charley Harper's earliest retro pieces and magazine work as well. Love the book and am still in awe that it's such a low price. It's a very thick heavy book. Great as a coffee table book or just as part of your book collection.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Initially I was skeptical as to whether or not of the keyboards could really offer anything different or just genuinely distinguish themselves from the rest of the pack, and much to my surprise this app does just that. Somehow it takes typing on a cell phone to another level. I didn&apos;t consider myself to be a slow type in the first place but this app really does help with speed as well as efficiency. Also, I&apos;m not a personal fan of swype but a lot of other people are and this app has that setting as well. Overall a surprisingly well developed app and well worth the money. I am pleased with my purchase and I recommend this app to anyone who doesn&apos;t have it already.
B004EPZ08O|4.0|Try as you might, you just can't beat Death. For over ten years, the \\"Final Destination\\" franchise has weathered a wave of remakes and torture flicks to become one of the most wild and inventive (not to mention, profitable) horror series of its time. Unfortunately the series went stale rather quickly, culminating in 2009's underwhelming fourth and \\"final\\" installment, \\"brilliantly\\" titled \\"THE Final Destination.\\" But just as Jason and Freddy taught us oh so many years ago, you can't keep a good franchise down. In that spirit, a mere two years later, \\"Final Destination 5\\" is upon us. Can a fifth installment in the series make up for the sins of its predecessor while keeping things fresh and original, not to mention faithful, to its origins? The answer is a surprising \\"Yes.\\"<br /><br />The plot this time revolves around a group of co-workers on their way to a company retreat. A handful of them manage to survive a colossal bridge collapse thanks to the unexplainable premonition of Sam (Nick A'Gosto), who is nice enough to save his cold-hearted girlfriend (Emma Bell) just minutes after dumping him. What a guy. In true \\"Final Destination\\" fashion, things take a turn for the worse as Death comes calling for the group, picking them off one by one in unimaginably brutal and outlandish ways. Back in the picture is the morbid mortician played by Tony Todd to enlighten the group about death's design, leading a member of the group to take matters into his own hands. Now not only do the remaining survivors have death on their back, but they also have to be cautious of each other and even of themselves.<br /><br />First time director Steven Quale gives the series a serious shot in the arm after the previous two installments (tackled by original Final Destination director James Wong and Final Destination 2 director David R. Ellis, respectively) lowered the bar both visually and story-wise. Quale, who has spent a considerable amount of his career working under James Cameron, obviously has a keen sense of humor as well as dread, and it shows through in what is not only the series' most insane and over-the-top installment, but also one of the most intense as well. Not only is the film gruesome and gross, but it is also grim and unpredictable to boot. The script, penned by Eric Heisserer (whose credits include 2010's less than stellar \\"Elm Street\\" remake and the upcoming \\"The Thing\\" prequel), freshens up the formula quite a bit, adding dimension to characters and giving the third act some much needed tension. Not only does the ending take a left-turn for once, but it also serves to wrap the series up in a nice bow, complete with a montage set to the tune of AC/DC's \\"If You Want Blood, You Got It.\\" Add to that a batch of well-executed 3D effects and you've got a package that just can't be beat.<br /><br />Sure, it's still pretty formulaic at its heart, but \\"Final Destination 5\\" has enough tricks up its sleeve to surprise and satisfy those seeking a genuine roller-coaster ride of horror. No sequel could ever hope to top the 2000 original (which was pretty unique in its time) but this one comes about as close as possible. Go into it expecting a gory and gross good time that plays with your expectations and you'll have a good time. It's rare a horror film comes along these days that does its job this efficiently, so enjoy it while you can.sense of humor as well as dread, and it shows through in what is not only the series' most insane and over-the-top installment, but also one of the most intense as well.

0385342055|5.0|\\"My head droops down onto my knees. I feel exhausted. All my remaining energy has been sapped away ... I've got nothing left. I've got no hope, no plans, no answers ... A tear suddenly rolls down the side of my nose, followed by another. I'm going to have to admit defeat ... I give a huge sob and bury my face in my hands. I can't believe I'm giving up. But what else can I do?\\" - Becky, at an uncharacteristic low point<br /><br />So, my wife, who usually pays no attention to my choice of books, noticed MINI SHOPAHOLIC on my desk, smirked, and said, \\"What, you're reduced to reading chic-lit now?\\"<br /><br />OK, you caught me out in my dark, secret place. Does that make your day?<br /><br />Actually, I've been reading selected, trashy chic-lit for years. Anyone who's followed my book reviews will have noticed long before this. The two biggest examples of my descent into unmanly behavior are the SHOPAHOLIC series by this author, Sophie Kinsella, and the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich. Unfortunately, the latter, which I believe is about to have the eighteenth installment published soon, ran out of steam as far as I'm concerned about five volumes ago; Evanovich continues to write to a tired old script that incorporates no character growth in her heroine while hoping to extort a few more dollars out of an increasingly disenchanted fan base.<br /><br />On the other hand, Kinsella manages to keep the continuing adventures of Rebecca Bloomwood Brandon reasonably fresh by having Bex evolve through her life's important periods and events: single womanhood, engagement, marriage, discovery of a long-lost sister, pregnancy, and, here in MINI SHOPAHOLIC, child rearing. Constants, of course, are Becky's predilection for extravagant shopping and her impulsive, unrealistic solutions to problematic situations. Despite the exasperation she causes husband Luke - exasperation that would compel any more sensible man to divorce her without delay, if not sooner - Becky's great attributes are her good nature and kind heart.<br /><br />In MINI SHOPAHOLIC, Bex faces a plethora of challenges that convert to a perfect storm of perceived crises: acquisition of a long-delayed new home, Luke's upcoming birthday which absolutely demands a surprise party, and spouse-imposed austerity measures, i.e. no personal shopping, in response to a run on England's banks. Finally, Luke is insisting on professional help for their two-year old daughter, Minnie, who may be becoming irredeemably spoiled by her Mum. (Hmmph! You think?) In any case, for the first time I can recall in this ongoing series of (to date) six books, Becky's usual spirited confidence in her (misdirected) abilities to cope is brought to its knees. Then, help arrives from an unexpected source.<br /><br />In short, while Stephanie Plum is moribund, Becky is very much alive. So long as she is, I'll keep reading chic-lit.kind heart.
