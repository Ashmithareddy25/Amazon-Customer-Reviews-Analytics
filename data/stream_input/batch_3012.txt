B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game when I bought it I. didn't know how to play it but I got the hang of it after a while.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a good gaime init? Very addictive for those who can't seem to help it I must say... I would have given a 5star but for that the game would have to be like real u get me?
B0091REZMW|3.0|It is okay but I play it on my tablet.  I'm older, wear glasses and don't see as well as I used to.  There's a lot of it that I have trouble seeing.  I would recommend to anyone who has good eyesight & likes finding items in photos.
B001NTUDVI|5.0|Mariah has a sultry and inviting voice with the sounds of Sexiness,  fun, Love  and the now. I'd purchase anything she put OUT!....LOL
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I really enjoyed this  story.  It was exciting, suspenseful and kept my interest.  I will look fir more book by this author.  Enjoy!
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|It's an ok game really but needs more selection of weapons .I'm not trying to make it sound bad ,though
B001XUPD94|5.0|Star Trek V the Final Frontier is one of the most underrated treks of the 12 thus far.  It's easy to see what went wrong with this movie.  However, I would like to point out what was done right.  First, Shatner did understand the Kirk, Spock McCoy relationship.  The movie attempted to be a social commentary on the dangers of organized religion and messiah like figures, which was a problem in 1989 ala Jimmy Swaggart Jim Bakker scandals. The villain even wears white robes like many televangelists.
B00B7ERH04|2.0|When you're going to take the picture it is upside down. It's a little hard to tell how's going to come out. But the final picture when you see it in your album it's right side up. Just confusing. I gave it 2 stars cause the picture was clear.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|I enjoyed the way the narrator always stayed present with us, even when we were in flashback. You really get caught up in her dilemma, both sides seem equally appealing. Overall I really enjoyed it and didn't think it fell into many of the annoying YA traps.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's cute  just wish there were different levels. After running the same 3 it gets to be a little boring but overall my son loves it
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Imagine a world where there are no good X-Men.  What would happen if there are only villains with great powers and no heroes?  What becomes of the cities, government, people in general?  That is what Steelheart is about.<br /><br />\\"I know, better than anyone else, that there are no heroes coming to save us. There are no good Epics. None of them protect us. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\"<br /><br />David learned that at a young age the first time he saw Steelheart, the day his father died.  Since then he has lived his life with one goal and one goal only.  To kill the Epic that killed his father.<br /><br />This is my very first Brandon Sanderson novel and I loved it.  Sometimes it is difficult for me to read UF from a male perspective it ends up being all about big boobs and girls in skin tight clothing and high heeled boots but that couldn't be farther from the truth here.  Brandon created a very intricate dystopian world in the wreckage of Chicago now referred to as Newcago.  He has painstakingly thought out a class system for all of the Epics and the powers they use.  He has also built a believable resistance of renegade humans that try to fight against them.  I was definitely impressed with the sheer volume of thought that went into those two items of the story.<br /><br />I was interested in this world from the beginning.  David is a very likeable character he is a slight know it all but has the hardest time putting a metaphor together which kind of made him endearing to me. Once he meets up with the Renegades you can tell he really has been alone for most of his life and protector that I am I just wants him to win.  Of course there is an older man to look up to has a substitute father figure that helps guide our young David out of his blind hate and need for revenge.<br /><br /> \\"It's good for you to think of this, son. Ponder. Worry. Stay up nights, frightened for the casualties of your ideology. It will do you good to realize the price of fighting\\"<br /><br />There are some really nice philosophical questions posed that can make this more than just a story of revenge.  You have the choice to delve in and think of this world on a deeper level or just move on with the story.  No agenda is forced on you which I appreciate as a reader.<br /><br />There is a cute little crush romance that isn't quite insta love but is heartwarming all the same and some very interesting developments that I really didn't see coming.  The story twisted just enough at the end that I really was surprised.  I seriously had a moment of woe is that real.<br /><br />Actionwise sometimes it is over the top for me (I'm a girl but my stepson disagrees with my assessment whole heartedly).  It is an action book for sure and there are a lot of scenes with fighting and motorcycle chases and a final battle that goes on for multiple chapters.<br /><br />All in all good storlyline, nice pacing,  solid world building for a first book of a series and great start to the layering that I see will come out in future books in the series.  All of the characters definitely have a backstory worth developing a little more.<br /><br />I will definitely have to check out some of Mr. Sanderson's other works if they compare to or are better than this one.rice of fighting\\"<br /><br />There are some really nice philosophical questions posed that can make this more than just a story of revenge.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|This was a great extent you could have on your kindle that works and helps you to your extent over and over again.
145162607X|3.0|If you have read the White Queen this is the same story but from a different perspective.  I suggest reading one or the other but not both.  I understand the Red Queen is also from another perspective of the same era.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Not sure what to say here. I use the thing to keep track of my D&D character's hit points but you could use it for other maths too.
0811879542|5.0|This is a whole new level of interactivity! I have my copy of this book since my kid was 1,5 and since the very beginning she was interacting with it very well! There's nothing complicated for 1,5 year child to rub, shake or blow and every time the result is different so she fell in love with it immediately. And now she's almost 3 and she still loving it! She can do whole book activity, then turn the page to 1 and start all over again! Adorable hand-drawn circles show that you don't have to be a great illustrator to make a child book that is a bestseller! Simply amazing book, so if you still don't have it after reading so many positive reviews - go buy it. Your kid will love it.
B005R32L66|1.0|Skype needs a serious update for the Kindle Fire because it is a joke to use! Takes 10 minutes for my camera to finally connect with the call. I can hear the other person after about 2 minutes but still have to wait way too long to see them. I'm better off using my laptop or my iphone.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Absolutely wonderful!!!!!!  From bloopers to commentary it was really fun.  I can't say enough nice things about it. A ++
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|grandson loved it, he was so happy.  It was easy to learn and he is 3 years old.  I recomend this product and rate it a 5 star
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Clean Master is a very good app. It is as good as it claims. It helps clean-up your cell phone, kindle, etc. I have the same program on my cell phone, and Clean Master is equally as good as advertised on my cell phone as on my kindle.
0810989956|5.0|I choose this rating because I loved the content and all the questions of the book and they were very funny, I will recommend all the fans of Greg and all the characters of this amazing book, I loved all the pictures and all the questions because they were so cute and funny, also I recognize that the part in white its a very good idea because we can create our own questions or our own diary if we like.<br />  Thank you!
B001CDZZI6|5.0|This was one of the most beneficial activities I have been involved in.  As a matter of fact, I had my entire team complete this assessment at work.  We then gathered to discuss each of our strengths and how this would strenghten us as a team.  Great professional development activity for work, but also great for individuals.
0307887448|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book. It was a lot of fun, and like all geeks, I loved catching most of the in-jokes with which Cline plastered the work. However, two things prevent me from giving this book five stars<br /><br />1: I didn't learn anything from this book. The sci-fi themes in this book are pretty well-worn, even if coated in an 80's era geeky cloak<br /><br />2: There were three major plot holes in the book that really bugged me<br /><br />Spoiler alert....just quit reading now<br /><br />A: Wade was too young to have consumed that much media from the deep past, even assuming he ignored virtually everything in his present. There is simply no way a 17-year-old could have become an absolute master of so many games, watched every teen-oriented movie from that era to the point of memorization, etc.<br /><br />B: Wade et al should have been able to predict the ace up the sleeve that the sixers used at the end of the novel. After generating and executing such an audacious plan, why did Wade and friends walk straight into a sixer trap that both the readers and those within the novel should have been able to predict? Instead, they blundered into it and were saved by dumb luck (and Chekov's gun).<br /><br />C: The riddle for the first gate would not have taken the sixers five years to solve - more like five days. Heck, a quick Google search gets you half way there in a few milliseconds longer than it takes you to type \\"tomb ho\\". Even today's supercomputers and image analysis (let alone those of the 2040's) would make mincemeat of the rest within hours.<br /><br />Spoilers off...<br /><br />That being said, this book is worth reading and one of the most purely enjoyable novels I have read in a while. Hopefully Cline can follow it up with something in a similar vein.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Such a compelling story of the choices we make and those we don't. Highly recommend for those who enjoy the twists and intrigue!
B00915G6R6|5.0|Just happy that I could get season 4 already now - thanks to 'globalization' ;) I bought it from Germany<br />the best series ever ! season 4 is a success  -  I love it !
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enough plot twists and turns to keep the pages turning. Main character,Mal, is not especially likeable, but he is interesting and intelligent. Enjoyable read!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I like a futuristic movie that is based on real life, real people.<br /><br />This great story is simple yet very, very on the edge of your seat! I felt like I could not take a breath there was so much going on. Great visuals, good acting from all.<br />Brad PItt is an amazing actor how he can portray very intelligent person, yet shows his vulinerabilty, and emotions.<br /><br />I very much recommend this done very well, movie!

B006AN78XS|5.0|My wife and I enjoy staying in Paris. This film brings back fond memories. We will be going back soon and revisit some of the places shown in the film.
B00B52F278|5.0|Extraordinary story.  Excellent acting.  Once you're past all the blood, open skulls, nudity and sex, you're left with one of the best fiction tales ever created. The epic scenes, the intensity of characters leave you watching episode after episode, it's highly addictive. I hope they come up with some sort of spin-off series any time soon.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I loved this game until I did an update and now  it's gone...no islands no dragons if I want to continue to play I have to start over and I don't know if I am willing to spend all my time again ....sadness!!!!!
B000FC130E|3.0|I really like Neil Gaiman's quirky worlds - this one was a bit more straight forward fantasy than some of his others - but a very enjoyable read nonetheless - if you're thinking about it go ahead and read it!
B00596WEVI|5.0|If you've seen the finale of Breaking Bad, you'll be having deja vu if you're a JCVD fan. I mean the cell phone, the fake fight, the gimmick gun outside the building taking out all the bad guys???? All unapologetically stolen from this movie. What lazy screenwriting on such a supposedly topnotch TV series. Well folks, you saw it here first. So if the critically acclaimed Breaking Bad uses a Van Damme script to wind up their series, then Assassination Games shoulda got an Academy Award, ya know?
0790729407|4.0|I got the movie in record time, a lot sooner than expected. The produce was new and no flaws when I watched it.
1591843790|5.0|Really appreciates the style of writing, very easy to grasp the concepts. Becoming more open-minded allows one to &#34;make&#34; opportunities.
B00004WQ3A|5.0|The downward spiral on vinyl sounds amazing. This classic NIN album is in my regular rotation. Brings me back to 94' when music wasn't such a rarity.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is great family entertainment. Just love to watch it. Would reccomend to everyone  who likes a laugh and intrigue.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book really pulled on my heart strings. Although somewhat predictable, it never failed to make me think, connect the dots and reality this is today.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Good book on current issues of gender equality in the workforce. I have observed many of these similar topics in my own career but had never articulated them as well  as Sandburg does in this book. Book  is great for men and women alike.
B005DJREGQ|3.0|Funny, sweet, a little too adult considering the ages of the characters. Sometimes too cliche on the personalities and predictable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire was an Awesome book!! I'm very excited to start on the next. Now I'm even more excited to see the movie!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Aprppriate don't worry it's fun and like a subway surfers with a fun and humorous story. yay I love it.
B007S3S8HO|4.0|I guess it depends on the age of your child, but I was not too impressed by this one. It is short lived fun, as many toys. Otherwise, no issues. We received it in time and without any issues.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|This app is boring because I have to keep waiting for it to load its been an hour And its still not done not worth 1.99 :-/
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Grrrr.  I want to like this.  I really do, this does not work.  It does nothing but lock up my phone.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I kept trying to think of what REACHER  was going to next before l got to each chapter. He is pretty sharp on all aspects of military moves. I REALLY like him . LEE really has me hooked. This is the third book I have read,and will probably read the rest of the REACHER series.
B00BL5EQLC|1.0|Nope.  Not even once.  This has never worked not once.  It locks up my system to the point where I have to shut the phone down and restart it.
006117758X|5.0|Raw, real, no holds barred. Henry Chinaski is someone you will not forget if you read this novel. Charles Bukowski's best book of all, followed by Women. His writing style draws you in to the main character's psyche, his fears, his hopes, his existence. If you ever felt like an outsider Bukowski shows you just how bad but liberating it can really be.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|I recently saw CSN on tour, so I was ready for some studio material from whichever guy was recording. Stephen and friends rose to the occasion with this effort and getting it through Amazon was a good way to go.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The good wife taken very well and it is very interesting to know how the attorney office works.. different characters involved..
B003097B64|5.0|I had all of Little Feat on vinyl years ago, but after converting most everything to CD, I still had some gaps in my collection. All five of these studio albums are brilliant and come in nice packaging. I am pleased with the pricing, and would have bought them individually if necessary. Still great music!!!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Sherlock is WONDERFUL! Benedict plays an AMAZING Sherlock Holmes. He reminds me a lot of Sherlock in the American version, Elementary; very quirky and witty and AWESOME!!  I am looking forward to watching the entire season!
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Gives great insight for running and a excellent motivator:) .<br />Anyone who is interested in running must read this and must have this in their collection.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Loved being able to catch up before the new season started. It was nice to watch the entire season in a few days.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Watched this movie with my husband and kids. My husband is not a &#34;kid movie&#34; kind of person but he laughed the whole way through along with the rest of us. My son laughed harder than I've ever seen him laugh at a movie. This is a must see for sure!!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a really fun game but the severs are nere impossible to get on over all its worth it though.
B00821OX98|4.0|I like Stephen king stuff.  This had a good story and was fast paced. I would recommend to everyone highly.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is an excellent author, this book was very cleverly written and is a must read for anyone who likes a good book.  I cant say much about it because I dont want to spoil any part of the story, but I highly recommend this novel!
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Sounds like music from a broadway play! As usual , nicely done Sting. Hope to catch the performance. Sounds a little autobiographical.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I could play this game all day long! It has lots of super cool characters and power ups, not to mention the setting changes every month..
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show never gets boring, always something new and, always interesting!! I highly recommend this series to all. Don't miss it.
B003ASLJQS|1.0|I love Clint but not this movie. There are some subjects that just don't make a good movie. The technical details were all done well but you won't feel better for having seen this movie.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Every episode has been awesome. The dynamics between the characters has been great. I love forward to seeing me from this show.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|It's still Clint but didn't appeal to me a lot. It is a very interesting story and is well-acted. I guess I expected something on the level of &#34;Gran Torino&#34;. That is my personal benchmark for Clint's movies.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Can someone please explain to me why this app has used 265 mb of my data plan in three days?  I haven't used it, it says its all background data.  At this rate I'll go over my limit in a week!  I'd like to use the app but it is currently uninstalled.  I don't see the option on my note 3 to stop background data on one app only.  Help!
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|I purchased this to play the Harry Potter movies on my PS3, but also works on all other Blu-Ray movie players. I never really thought Blu-Ray was worth it until this purchase, perhaps because I love these movies so much. Extra features are good and quality is worth it to any true fan.
B003730LRY|4.0|Good. Classic movie. Enjoyed it. Visually, not to bad. Love instant prime movies on my Wii. Very convenient. ! !
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I love this show, it is one of my favorites.  The characters on the show are great and play their parts perfect.
B00000IBVC|5.0|This production has to be on of the greatest feats ever achieved with a piece of theatre - in this case a full opera with thousands of Chinese actors and artists as extras but also part of the cast.  The inimitable Zubin Mehta certainly knew what he was taking on in the conducting role. Zhang Yimou as Director had a huge task put before him, but one which he made into such a successful spectacle.  And let;s not forget the more than adequate singers in this production.  Sergej Larin as Calaf and Giovanna Casolla as Turandot  are superb.  This DVD is a must have and own forever item.  I am so happy I found it.  It was posted quickly, took a while to reach me in Australia but was packed well and arrived safely. Would definitely recommend the same seller to the Opera lovers out there.
B00F2362IE|5.0|Y'all should add splinter as a charter so it would be even cooler and add a new place to run like in the city or in the sewer or in sprinter's hideout y'all would get more fan's for the show and game about ever kid in the would might play it
B006TF6WAM|3.0|Immediately I come to the end of a book I ask myself how I feel: inspired? excited? wish it hadn't ended? pleased I got to the end? etc. I ask myself the same question a few days later. Most time the answer is the same. With 'The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry' however the answers were different. On finishing I thought 'so what, weak story, poor ending, why did Harold Fry put himself through all that?' On reflection however I realised that Rachel Joyce had managed to keep my attention until Harold reached the end of his journey, not an easy thing to do because I still think the storyline is weak. Am I glad I read it to the end - no. Would I recommend it - I'm struggling to write ... y ... ye ... yes, but there you are I've done it.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|This is one of my favorite Disney Channel original movies;the cast,plot and the wonderful music all blend in together perfectly.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I didn't like the sound of this & put off looking at it for over a year. Then I watched 1 episode & was hooked.<br />This is in the 'Breaking Bad' category.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|I like a movie with a plot like this(only the kind of plot Disney could cook up);the fact that Ross Lynch and Maia Mitchell are in this movie(and also all the great singing,too)also make it great.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I like this game because it is just way better then the other one way way better it is the best
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|I love Taylor Swift's music;the fact that there's some of my favorite songs of hers on this combo pack(and a video of my absolute favorite song&#34;You belong with me&#34;on it too),was what convinced me to buy it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Very good movie and can't wait for the next one hopefully there is another one and it won't  be long!
B008R14YBK|5.0|I listened to every song on this CD;I loved them all,and the fact that Bridgit Mendler sung them makes it well worth buying.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved this version of the beginning of lord of the rings, awaiting the other parts of this trilogy. great
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|This movie was disturbing,touching and at the same time very entertaining;the end of the movie was what touched(and frightened me)the most.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|this version was a little dry in the beginning , not enough emotion but soon heated up and became very good

B005BZQVJ8|1.0|I can't believe the people who gave this piece of trash a five-star rating -- totally clueless!<br /><br />DO NOT waste your money on this toilet-bowl of a movie, I'm giving you fair warning! If it were a freebee for Amazon Prime customers, then go ahead, waste your time, you can always turn it off after the fist ten minutes without monetary loss.<br /><br />So here's the review, I'm going to start with the few decent points about the film (I'll try to be as charitable as possible).<br /><br />Concept:  Frankly, I did like the basic concept, it was somewhat along the lines of Galaxy Quest (an excellent film with solid A-list stars like Tim Allen & Allen Rickman).<br /><br />Plot: Alien survey ship crashed on Earth back in 1947. Alien pilot befriended by 11 yr. old girl then taken away by \\"authorities\\".  Alien held captive & interrogated. Over the years, provides authorities ideas about how to soften the blow to the human race when the rest of his kind arrives.  One funny clip showing alien on speaker-phone advising Steven Spielberg on the making of \\"E.T\\". Alien fails to reveal secrets behind certain advance technologies, authorities decide he's no longer a valuable asset & decide to dissect him.  Alien escapes & runs into two hapless / clueless sci-fi geeks from the U.K.  Geeks are on a once-in-a-lifetime road trip to visit all the famous UFO sites in the States; they cross paths with escaped alien during a night-time highway crash.  Alien needs to get to special \\"place\\" (says, \\"you'll know it when you see it\\") where he can signal for a rescue ship. Geeky guys agree to take him. Bad guys pursue alien & new friends.  That's pretty much the entire movie. To be fair, I like the plot as a basis for a nice family-friendly funny-film / good date-flick.  Sadly, it all goes downhill from there.<br /><br />I condemn this film for two reasons: first,the incessant need for 7-th grade locker room humor, even-more-infantile toilet-humor and non-stop gratuitous foul language.  There were a few bits where MAYBE it was funny ONCE! But the writers just kept it up all throughout the film -- it just wasn't funny to thinking-people!<br /><br />The second problem was the use of blatant stereotyped fundamentalist Christian characters. It's ok to make some brief political commentary then move on, but they just kept bashing these people all throughout the film, right up to the very end.  Why was that necessary?  What did it add to the film? Once again -- NOT FUNNY! What do you think would have happened had they depicted a Muslim, Native American, Asian American or Mexican American family in this manner.  Hollywood leftists never tire of telling us how \\"sensitive\\" and \\"respectful\\" they are when it comes to cultural diversity -- unless, of course, you happen to be Christian.<br /><br />You can make political / social commentary in a constructive way. The writers could have allowed the antagonists to evolve towards some new world view having room for both points of view.  Instead, we see Paul, the alien, depicted as a comical \\"demon\\" trying to seduce a devoutly-Christian girl from her faith, her belief in God, when the issue was the fundamentalist life style forced upon her.  Alas, we have to endure this thinly-veiled theological raping throughout the entire film. It was demeaning and just plain uncomfortable to watch at times; the entire sub-plot added absolutely nothing to the primary story line.<br /><br />As an alternative, the writers could've allowed Paul to be (like his Biblical namesake) a kind of teacher, someone to help the girl see the world from a different perspective; someone who shows her how to embrace and strengthen her faith in a new way by adopting a broader context beyond the limited belief-system she grew up with. They could've spent a minute on the father and what made him the way he was. But the audience was only allowed to see daddy as some deranged Bible-thumping kook in a beat-up Chevy pickup. THAT'S PATHETIC WRITING!<br /><br/>Heavy message? Sure,but really GOOD comedy writers can pull off something that's philosophically deep while still doing straight-up comedy.  They did in in Galaxy Quest: a funny movie that switched to drama before you realized you were sucked into it. We see a bunch of has-been T.V. stars well past their prime, trying to make a buck at shopping mall openings and sparsely-attended sci-fi conventions. Suddenly, they're propelled into an alien world engaged in a life-and-death struggle for survival. Our motley crew of Hollywood-has-beens are given the choice to go back to their boring lives or stay and fight with their new alien companions -- they chose to fight! \\"Never surrender, never give up!\\" That one simple scene goosed what was a decent funny-picture into overdrive that kept the audience engaged to the end. There was nary a foul word spoken during the entire film and it had broad appeal to all age groups over 12 yrs. Though it flopped in ticket sales (poor marketing) it did well in the DVD market and stands as a cult-favorite today.<br /><br />Paul lacked all those qualities; the writers thought it was easier to go for cheap gutter-humor laughs, foul language and blatant stereotyping.  I truly felt sorry for some of the actors; they could have done a better job if the director had simply thrown out the script and told them to ad lib their scenes instead.
B008GFI418|5.0|Great!! The 5th and quintaescential Beatle's point of view. This is the man who invented the pop music as we know it today.

B009LDD22U|5.0|What's not to say great show!!!! Every show has it's good and bad episodes but this one has more good than bad and I always find myself laughing at every episode they are just so funny. Now I can enjoy the my favorite episode any time I want!!
0099526158|3.0|Its sort of a an autobiography. I would recommend purchasing it if you really like murakami and his style of writing.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Absolutely, the worst of the five books.  George must have run out of ideas by book five. Boring descriptive details is not aa substitute for a plot and story line.  Boo.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This is a great book!  It is wonderfully written and is a very interesting read.  The author's ability to describe each scene is amazing as you felt like you were in the story.  Even though the author tells you what is coming, it is still interesting in how the scene plays out.<br />I would highly recommend this book as it is extremely well written and is hard to put down.
B000YDI9UG|4.0|This was my first time buying Timberland boots, so I had no idea they ran roomy. Seemed about a half-size too large, so I ordered another, smaller pair. This second pair fits much better, but I would be curious to try yet another pair, one-half-size smaller.<br /><br />Other than the size issues, these boots have a great, classic style and are very comfortable.
B00066FBS4|3.0|I thought I was getting the Atlantic label like the one I was trying to replace. I never have heard the 4 Men with the Beard label.
B00AFEY354|2.0|I fell the hell asleep early in this one, sorry but the perks of renting were extra sleep for me.
B00005KB8F|3.0|I was a little disappointed that it wasn't the Atlantic label.  I never have heard of 4 Men with Beards.

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars is the best yet. The Cd is more versatile for my needs.  The cd is absolutely fantastic! As always, shipping and delivery were perfect
0061950726|5.0|The book was good. A quick read. It's sad to think I had no idea this had even gone on in our country! It was never taught in our schools, and it should have been!
B00EE3FTNM|4.0|Very good police crime drama.  Reminded me a lot of The Killing on AMC.  Broadchurch was much better paced than The Killing.  I felt 8 episodes was the perfect length.  Tennant and the rest of the cast were very good.
B00571F26Y|4.0|The more I read the more I saw myself. The more I took his counsel the better I felt. It was money well spent.
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|I liked this movie...liked the cast of characters alot. Also liked the double-crossing back & forth of the storyline. I would recommend it. Only negative (which doesn't affect my rating) is the storyline of the sterile, unemotional state of earth.
B00328G4Y8|5.0|Jimi Hendrix died about the time I discovered his music. I had my FM radio tuned in as they played a marathon of his songs due to his passing and I was blown away with the sounds emminating from his guitar. Axis: Bold As Love is solid album that has no filler material. This album ranks just below his masterpiece Electric Ladyland.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love it, looking forward for more seasons! I only saw 1 & 2<br /> This is the type os series than mean are looking for worlwide, OK alert<br />there are more?
B00FPH6M82|1.0|This story was un-watchable. The storyline and dialog was stale, sci-fi details were disjointed and or rip-offs and the acting (by Jaden) was laughably horrible.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A book full of suspense and twists.  Everytime you think you have the plot figured out it takes a turn.  Great reading.  Crazy characters.  Brilliant writing!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Very interesting follow to The Shining.  Could relate as I have a family member whom is an addict.  As always with Mr. King could not put the book down even though I hope not read a story by him in years.

B001A4LYN2|4.0|This movie is an outstanding movie about oil exploration in the opening years of the Twentieth Century.  It ably describes the people of the California Desert and their struggles.  It has only one flaw.  The story is unbalanced.  Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Eli (Paul Dano) engage in a long term, vicious struggle over tiny slights that ultimately destroy both of them.  Why would a successful minister and pragmatic businessman get stuck in such a quagmire of a conflict?<br /><br />Great movie otherwise.

B008XNZMOU|4.0|Taylor Swift really branched out with this album with several genres included in the song list. Some are more catchy and appealing than others, but not every song can be a hit. I respect that she has had success in several genres. It shows that she is versatile and lasting. Good for her!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is okay I like the designs but the game is just frusterating when you die so my sister says that it is fun to die she says that it is good to die beacause she hates everything about this game cause she always dies so she hares everyone that gets higher than her she only gets to the first part then dies she never gets a higher score than 234
B00C7607BC|4.0|I hadn't watched this movie in over a decade and it transported me back to when I was a little girl watching a magical princess movie. What a classic! I'm also really happy about the triple combo pack. I don't have a Blu-ray player, but I might some day. So for now I can watch the DVD or watch on my computer with the Digital Copy. I kinda wish that with all the hype there were more special features included in the diamond edition.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Life is an adventure. People need encouragement along the way. The innocence of young children we can all learn from. This book has it all. A young lad searching for purpose finds friends who help him along his journey.
B005721W9O|5.0|For aliens to be monitoring a tv show and assuming the crew is real, having those skills - very fresh and funny.
0440422973|1.0|I suppose I expected this novel to, in some manner, have a legal undertone, but it didn't.  This novel was a quick read, but it really never got my attention.  In retrospect, I really can't tell someone what this book was about.  I can, however, say unequivocally, if  I never hear the phrase &#34;Frosty The Snowman,&#34; it won't bother me in the least.
B008FWHGYS|1.0|Watched about 7 or 8 minutes and fell asleep...  Well almost...<br />I figured Anthony Hopkins would help this story, but it just didn't have enough story to hold my interest...<br />I would have rated this a half-star if there was that option.
B00C0W08XK|5.0|I am new to Sudoku, and having access to all levels of difficulty is necessary as I (hopefully) improve my skills. This game gives that to me. It's easy to use, allows me to &#34;pencil in&#34; possible numbers before committing to one, and even provides help if needed. It has easy, medium, and difficult levels, sound (or not), and saves unfinished games for you. Unlike some other game apps that go through a series of levels and then offer nothing new, this Sudoku game has virtually endless game and level variations so I can play for an unlimited time and never get bored or feel like I'm repeating games.  Now I don't have to wait a week for the game of my preferred skill level to be published in the newpaper.  Well worth the price.
B00DY9WZ7K|4.0|I've been a NIN fan for years, and every time a new album comes out, I'm not sure I like it at first. But I give each one a few listens before deciding. After about five times through, I start to really like each one. Hesitation Marks is no different. At first I wasn't so sure I liked it, but after listening to it about 10 times now, I REALLY like it. In today's age we're used to downloading single tracks we like and just listening to those. If you do that, you'll probably end up listening only to Copy of A, Came Back Haunted, and All Time Low. And you would really be missing out on pretty good album if you made that mistake.
0857933779|4.0|Law As Engineering: Thinking About What Lawyers Do takes a creative approach to law; instead of seeing law as closely associated with philosophy or economics, David Howarth points to legal design. Most attorneys aren't involved in litigation. Like engineers, they are often hired to provide services not in the abstract but for particular purposes, mostly to facilitate transactions or deals.<br /><br />Law firms sometimes design innovations, such as the `poison pill,\\" which can then be marketed to their clients or used to attract new ones. Howarth cites examples of Silicon Valley law firms investing their own money in start-ups they advise and goes on to discusses examples in family law and government where wills are designed to meet client goals and withstand legal challenges and regulations are crafted to formalize powers and obligations.<br /><br />Howarth argues that for scientists, understanding is the end goal, whereas for engineers understanding is a means to an end, the end of making useful things. Indeed, when asked if they would rather invent something useful or discover new knowledge, engineers preferred invention, whereas scientists preferred discovery. Unlike engineers, the problems lawyers tackle involve relationships between people, not concrete. Systems theory is useful in both. Legal devices that ignore conditions are unlikely to work.<br /><br />After teasing out his analogy, Howarth explores its implications on professional ethics, research and teaching. He discusses the fall of Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and the big short and asks if we can learn something from the longstanding concerns of engineers for safety, public welfare and \\"many hands\\" situations where responsibilities are widely dispersed. Citing how engineering has evolved, Howarth opines that where lawyers lacked the expertise necessary to understand the impact of risk-multiplying devices such as synthetic CDOs, that \\"should have been a spur to change, not an excuse for inaction.\\"  Like engineers who had to develop an understanding of human behavior to ensure safety, lawyers should have thought out the consequences by testing legal prototypes before widespread adoption.<br /><br />Does the new vision of law work? Yes, I think it does offer new insights and much might be borrowed from the engineering profession. It could also change the type of students attracted to law, the self-image of the profession, how public policy debates are framed and where to turn for allies. The financial crash provided a massive example of how lawyers can do harm. Howarth concludes: \\"to adopt the guise of engineers without also adopting the ethical standards that apply to them would be opportunistic, callow and self-serving. Lawyers can do better than that.\\"<br /><br />Let us hope attorneys build not only on the engineering analogy but also on Howarth's ethical advice.ke engineers who had to develop an understanding of human behavior to ensure safety, lawyers should have thought out the consequences by testing legal prototypes before widespread adoption.<br /><br />Does the new vision of law work?

B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|Remove the knowledge from your brain that M. Night Shyamalan (who's career has sadly been on a major downward spiral the past decade) directed this film and view it with an open mind.  Though \\"After Earth\\" is not one of the best Sci Fi films I've ever seen or have even seen recently, it's entertaining enough for a Saturday night viewing.  I've seen a lot of folks lambast Will Smith here in the reviews for supposedly \\"promoting\\" his son Jayden, etc.  I don't see it that way.  I think there was a story to be told here with a boy at the heart of the story and the role just happened to be filled by Jayden Smith.  I personally think Jayden did a serviceable enough job and I don't have any issues with his real life dad playing his on screen dad.  I think it was a good fit.<br /><br />What took me out of the movie though were some poor choices that really didn't make sense (spoilers ahead) The most obvious one was the ridiculous and pointless Southern accents.  There really wasn't any explanation at all as to why the characters even had Southern accents, let alone the fact that they really, REALLY couldn't pull them off convincingly.  It was more like listening to a parody of a southern accent.  I was also put off a little by Will's hard a$$ father character.  Yeah, yeah-I know it makes sense to have a stern father that can be made to respect the son by the son proving himself, but his portrayal of this character went beyond just stern (or fearless) into robot territory.  Showing a little humanity might've helped a person actually like the character more instead of thinking he's a complete jerk 99% of the movie.  Also-and this is probably my biggest gripe, you set up a story with the whole theme to be a son proving his worth as a man in his father's eyes, then when it's all said and done and the son has at last proven himself worthy, you go and throw it all away with one line. \\"I think I'd rather work with mom\\".  It sounds like a petty gripe in the scheme of things and theline does earn a laugh but everything the boy been through, everything he's done to earn his stripes is thrown right out the window.  It just makes the whole adventure seem suddenly pointless.<br /><br />I think folks have been a little harsh in their criticisms of After Earth as it truly does have some merit.  It's beautifully shot, it tells a compelling story, the special effects (for the most part) are pretty convincing and it's fairly unique.  I just think a few poor choices soured an otherwise entertaining experience.  I doubt the film would've earned such hatred if M. Night would've ghost directed this film under a different name.  Granted he's earned some of that animosity, but on it's own merits-the direction of After Earth is just fine.

B0012QRPU4|5.0|Great premise, writing, acting.  Every time you think it can't get any edgier, it does - and in ways you don't expect.  I just finished Season 1 and immediately ordered Season 2.  I'm hooked!

B004GTKP3S|4.0|The Cranford series is very enjoyable if you like a period pieces and good people oriented entertainment.  If you like Lark Rise to Candleford, you will most likely enjoy Cranford.  This series has some most entertaining characters who care about their small town and neighbors.  I love these English stories of home, neighbors and family.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|**I listened to the audiobook version**<br />Steelheart is a book about an \\"event\\" that give certain humans super human like powers.  However, these characters use their power to dominate in a \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" type way.  This is designed for young adults as almost all \\"comic books\\" with superheros are designed for young adults.  I almost let that turn me away, don't let it turn you away, it would be a mistake.<br />This book is a different take on the superhero because the guys with the powers are the villains, and the average guy has to be the hero.<br /><br />That being said, I will do my usual 2 good things 2 bad things and final summary.<br /><br />The two negatives, this is actually hard because it is a well written, not your average good guy vs bad guy book.<br /><br />- More details...I wish he had gone into more details at different parts of the book.  I wish he had developed out some of his points so they were not justified by the fact that he said something just was.  For his more original points he had let us in on the back story more.  (Some people criticize his story line as too far out there, come on, its super heroes and scifi.  I just preferred if he would have given some of the more scifi things a back story.)<br /><br />- It is a series and it makes you want to pick up the next one to answer the question, \\"What do they do now???\\"<br /><br />The positives<br /><br />- The action keeps the reader involved.  There are twists and turns as expected in an action adventure with comic book superheroes in it.<br /><br />- The twists that keep you guessing.  You think the ending is predictable until you get to the end.  I won't turn this into a spoiler but you will be surprised with the ending.  It is not what you will expect.  There are a few reviews out there that state that the ending is predictable, I doubt the authenticity of the reviewers, I think they may be overstating their intuition about the ending.<br /><br />Overall, if you like comic book type action heroes, this book will provide hours of entertaining reading.  It also provides for some deeper questions about power, about the right to rule over others (i.e. slavery), about the rights of those who rule over others (does a king have an obligation to provide and provide what for his subjects, etc).  Maybe I am too nerdy and the author does not intend these things to included but I thought about them as the book progressed.

B005LAII4E|4.0|After the Transformers films made ALL the money, Hasbro would have been foolish not to filmically weaponize their other toy lines... And of course Hasbro's biggest toy line is G.I. Joe. So it was a shock to everyone, and probably Hasbro most of all, when G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra did not do very well. I could muse forever on why, but what it boils down to is that the movie was sort of a mess and cost way too much to make. Against all common sense, Hasbro decided to trot out a sequel, and in the process they achieved a rare feat indeed: a good sequel to a mediocre film.<br /><br />Retaliation is a leaner film than its predecessor and I think that is to its advantage. While the first movie launched into crazy super-science right off the bat, Retaliation begins as a pretty plausible military thriller (albeit one with beautifully choreographed ninja fights, but still) and gradually works its way up to insane future warfare. As a result, when Dwayne Johnson's Roadblock (who sadly does not speak in rhyme) stages a one-man tank battle against a horde of Cobra H.I.S.S. tanks at the film's peak it seems like a really proper climax instead of still more silly action. What we do see of Cobra is more on model to the 80s cartoon as well, from Cobra Commander's outfit (shiny mask included) to their cartoonishly despotic plot for world domination which seems to consist of draping Cobra flags over everything and calling it a day.<br /><br />Please don't misunderstand- if the first film turned you off with its over the top sci-fi army games, this one isn't going to win you back. The McGuffin is a satellite that collapses London, there's a bad guy named Firefly who kills people with exploding robot bugs and has a motorcycle made of missiles, and RZA plays a blind ninja master who makes the heroes steal each other's hairs blindfolded for practice. Retaliation simply doles out the crazy in smaller, better-planned doses and as a result makes its moments of fancy seem special instead of dumb.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time! I could not put it down! I have recommended it to everyone.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I chose to read this book because I am a huge Harry Potter fan and thus wanted to continue to support Rowling and her great writing.<br /><br />The book is certainly well-written, with a lot of vivid detail and a relatively engaging plot. Not as engaging as Harry Potter by any means, but engaging enough to keep me reading even when I kept wanting to stop.<br /><br />However, I was quite disturbed by the frequent use of profanity in this book - including an overuse of the f-word - as well as the overly graphic descriptions of sex (or similarly graphic references to sex). I realize this book is supposed to be \\"adult\\" whereas Harry Potter was marketed to children, but I seriously was disturbed by this content, and kept telling myself I should stop reading, that this stuff was not what a decent Christian girl should be reading, but I think somehow I thought the book might get better eventually (which it does...the very end is a lot less adult than the rest of the book).<br /><br />That being said, Rowling does tackle a lot of societal issues in this book, some of which make sense given her personal background. For instance, she spends a lot of time on the issue of the Fields and the poverty there - and she herself was on welfare for many years. She deals with mental illness also, which we know she experienced (she said she based the Dementors off of her experiences being clinically depressed). Other issues covered in this book include adoption, death itself, physical and emotional abuse, cutting, drugs, gossip, prejudice, and hypocrisy. Probably all stuff Rowling has wanted to write about but couldn't in Harry Potter. That she tackled so many issues in one book is bold to say the least.<br /><br />So while the book has its merits, it has some VERY adult content. You have been warned.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|it was the best book I ever read for an 11 year old boy who loves comedy and loves to have fun it is a good book for my friendsv

B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I decided to read this book after being stuck in traffic opposite a poster advertising it. Best decision ever made. Thanks to the Big Bang Theory, we all know Don. He's the human Sheldon. What I found the best part of this funny, engagingly wonderful book was the fact that you can also see him through the eyes of the people around him. And they seem to like him as much as I did.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I feel this version of Angry Birds is the best so far! They have done a great job with graphics and made the game more interesting by giving goals to complete. I definitely recommend!

B00006ADD5|5.0|To me \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is one of best and great film of the 20 century. Peter O'Toole is at is best as Lawrence and story telling is every well told with every moment of your eyes and your ears, seeing and feeling what is \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\". To me, just a great all time film for all to see and still hold up today, in so many ways and more. One of cinema's greatest films and so breathtaking to see and enjoy anytime.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed the graphics and the story in this hidden object adventure. It is fun to play and also a challenge. It is definitely worth buying.
1400069807|4.0|Very eye opening in a disturbing way about the big food industry and their bottom line dollar priorities.  A must read for all.
B004TSKKF4|4.0|Once again Nicholas Spark tugs at the heart strings. Not my favourite of his but easy to read with likeable characters who live happily ever after.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I think I have read every story of Sherlock Holmes and seen every professional performance. I was not disappointed with this one. I love this series. The writing brings Sherlock Holmes to this century keeping the integrity of Sir Author Conan Doyle's original stories.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The characters are interesting, the scripts compelling, and I love the six main adult characters, to include Archie Panjabi. So well acted!  Julianna Margullies is tops in my book, and it is nice to see Chris Noth back in a more meaningful role than he had in Sex and the City.
B000SP3DE2|2.0|This movie has Keanu Reeves playing an Englishman.  It's hilarious.  I don't think that I really need to say anything more about it.

B008XKSW7M|1.0|This is just a god-awful movie and I think that it was supposed to be funny too.  My wife made me watch this with her and I have a natural aversion to chick flicks, but I gave it a chance anyway.  No matter how you slice it, this was just garbage.  Worst of all, I never figured out what to expect when I'm expecting other than that my life may be a collection of loosely tied together stories and unfunny humor.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Didn't see that coming. Have to admit I did not have this ending figured out ahead of time. Well done!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|An excellent book - I couldn't put it down. I find myself predicting the end of most novels but not this one.  The storyline, empathy for the characters and interesting point of view kept my interest to the end.  Recommend!

B009LDCXNY|5.0|What can I say? Supernatural hardly ever disappoints. This season, like all seasons is a roller coaster of highs and lows. In one episode you can have a speech from Braveheart and LARPing and the next episode can break your heart into billions of pieces. It is cleverly written, brilliantly acted, and creatively composed. My hopes are high for season 9.
B009ZQJ1G4|1.0|This movie stunk.  It had a fairly decent idea with some of the poorer writing and directing I've yet seen.  I found myself laughing at the absurdity multiple times.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|Well-known author and screenwriter Steve Pressfield introduces us to our biggest barrier to creativity—ourselves.  More specifically, he discusses “Resistance,” which most writers know as “writers block,” and the rest of the world as procrastination. Anyone who ever started a big project after much hemming and hawing knows the feeling all too well. To overcome the resistance of procrastination, Pressfield establishes a protocol that involves preparation, order, patience, endurance and staring down the fear that keeps us from taking the first step toward change and creativity. Finally, he tells us about the origin of true inspiration that comes from discipline and resolve. Pressfield has written a book that should be given to every new artist and any business person staring at a new project. Both will benefit mightily.

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Good graphics and match three play but slow.  You have to pause for a second between matches - the technology may be slightly behind...  But it keeps me engaged with increasingly challenging layouts.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|the series is great but I found this pretty pointless. I am just glad it didn't cost me any money.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Movie was okay for general audiences. Kids really enjoyed it. Will took a seat on this one. His son has potential I think.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I think this app is great for kids especially if they want to be a hairstylist. like me because it is great for a child's mind
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very interesting story that keeps the reader engaged.  Most families have secrets that are probably better left hidden rather than ruining many lives.  It makes you think about moral dilemmas.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|It was a great book - I enjoyed every word of it.  I like David Baldacci's writing and especially enjoyed this book.
B002NHGG92|5.0|I started one day to just try out the pilot to see what is was like.... I am hooked and I am not a teen. (50 year Old ) I love the show. i am now on the 2nd season and cannot wait to get to the 3rd and 4th...
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|really creepy movie, thought from the reviews it would be an excellent movie. that guy was one creepy dude. am getting rid of the dvd
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|If you love art than this is the movie for you!! every scene is like a painted portrait. it is a beautiful.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Great story with great character.  I hope it returns for a second season.  Greatest, low profile show on TV. You will like it
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Very fast paced and at times confusing...many names and dates are tossed about so it's difficult to retain who's who and where they are bouncing around the world/prison.  Read a lot like a documentary...lots of facts and not much keeping me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />I don't think a riveting, gossipy thriller was the intent, and I applaud Ms Kerman for sharing such intimate, embarrassing and humbling experiences. However, I thought there was going to be \\"more\\".<br /><br />I really hope some changes can come of the correctional system with exposure from this book!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game couldn't put it down for a minute! Had to use a cheat for one room but I had to figure it out or I would of been on it all night long!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't wait to start the next book. Downloading NOW. If it's anything like the first I won't put it down.
B002ZG9846|5.0|It's bloody, silly and fun. The most fun superhero movie yet! I can't wait for the sequel to be available!
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|My daughter plays this game. It doesn't have realistic looking hair. But it gives your child something to do and keep them quiet.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I got this free and deedadee me didn't realize it wasn't the WHOLE game,lol....SOOOOO when it got to the point where I HAD to buy it IF I wanted to continue playing....I was already into it and kinda HAD to get the rest of the game :)  BUT  idk about the $2.99 I paid.  IF it's longer than I think it is..and has MORE to it,then,I THINK, it will be worth it,I'm right b4 the wedding ceremony ,after u make the new potion,so I'm not sure how long it is yet -_-  So if I can update this review,when I finish the game,I will do so. It has some nice little challenges....puzzles...to make ya think :) so if u LIKE puzzle games and figuring things out,then this is for u. Well hope ya check it out and enjoy !
B007JRU2UK|3.0|I REALLY like George Clooney! I was less than impressed with the movie. It wasn't terrible but it certainly is not one I care to ever see again. Although the acting was great (I like George Clooney) the plot was weak and predictable.
B002QS5OQ4|4.0|enjoyed the trip so far, better than star trek. sometimes a little to much soap opera sometimes but then so is real life.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|As a pilot, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is very well written and tells an incredible true story about a B-17 pilot and a German ME 109 pilot.  It held my attention but may not be as interesting to someone who does not fly.  I would still recommend it, even for non-pilots.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|dragonvale is amazing I have an air dragon metal and earth plant fire lightning water and I even got a cotton dragon this game allows me to build a dragon zoo and so much more. buy it today you will love it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I loved this series from Episode 1!  I am on Season 2 now and have to stop myself from watching 3 or 4 episodes at a time.  It is a great family friendly show.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works for 2 reasons. I can set multiple alarms when I'm traveling. It's easy to set up. The alarms are not annoying. You can set the volume of the alarms.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was an enjoyable read. The storyline was interesting and kept you in suspense until the very end. I would definitely recommend this book to my friends and family.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|Great app that does everything it says it does. Usethis app regularly and helped alot after my surgery as my reminder for my meds.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I liked the first season a lot. The characters and storyline were great. I especially enjoy watching Walter and how is character is developing, especially in his relationship with Peter, his son.<br />This sort of reminds me of The X Files meets Grimm.<br />I do recommend this show to all sci fy fans out there. :-)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is easy to use I practice on it no I have a fifth grade level in math I on paste
B00EP22QKG|5.0|Joan seems to know herself very well. She's given me another kick-ass CD to play over and enjoy for the rests<br />Of my life.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|This movie, although a little out dated, was very well done and is a great watch! Anyone who likes sci-fi will enjoy this film.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I like the graphics.  It is fun to play. It still remains a challenge.<br /><br />I wish there were more levels.
B0091WR678|5.0|I have watched this movie several times.  Its one of those movies that gets better when you see it multiple times.  The special effects, acting and storyline are all amazing.  I, obviously, recommend it strongly.  Don't rent it, buy it.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|great CD.  Buble' & his orchestrations are so well done..  it's a super cd to play on a road trip, or just around the house.
0385351399|4.0|Mae Holland is the young protagonist of Dave Eggers' 2013 novel, The Circle. An Every(wo)man for Generation Y, Mea's story begins shortly after she's hired by The Circle, a fast-growing megacorp reminiscent of what a conglomeration of Amazon, Facebook and Google might look like. As a character, Mae is meant to embody characteristics common among college-educated twenty-somethings today. She's progressively-minded, optimistic, eager to please, willing to work hard and more than a bit impressionable. It strikes me that The Circle is primarily a theme-driven novel, and that Mae's experience of being plunged deeper and deeper into a conspiracy-rich totalitarian monopoly is used primarily as a vehicle to express the author's concerns about the unique pressures and implications of our social-media saturated age and its ever-increasing transparency.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|this is a wonderful original take on the movie version of the novel. It is a great movie, well done with fantastic sets & cinematography. The cast & crew are fantastic & the movie is very very entertaining.  they did a great job with the colorizing, but the B&W is just as much fun to watch & more nostalgic.  I got both =)
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great story. Unlikable main character you grow not to like but understand a little. Will be reading more from this author very soon.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|this is a wonderful original take on the movie version of the Jane Austen novel. It is a great movie, well done with fantastic sets & cinematography. Gwyneth is fantastic & the movie is very very entertaining.  =)
B005PW3OS8|4.0|It's an ok movie, parts of it are kind of hocky, but hey, it's a fantasy, comic book movie. I enjoyed watching it very much.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|this is a wonderful original take on the movie version of the Jane Austen novel Pride & Prejudice.  For my older, very proper Aunt's, there is only ONE comment that is made that is crude, but it flies by & they never noticed. It is a great movie, well done with fantastic sets & cinematography.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, though in order to fully appreciate it you have to have seen one of the movies based more on the book - otherwise you won't understand what's going on & get a lot of the humorous situations.  Still, if you haven't seen the movies based on the book (I like Keira Knightley's movie because of the locations used, and it's only 2 hours.)  Anyway, I highly recommend adding this movie to your collection. =)
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|It arrived in great condition, I&#34;m pleased with the packaging, but I hadn't played it since it is a Christmas gift for a big Columbo fan,
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Just started playing and its pretty cool so far. I like the variety of games. Lewis me interested! Can't wait to see what else is in store for me to figure out!
B004JMY312|4.0|Funny classic. Wanted to watch something light and casual. It did the trick. Good to watch around kids too, as long as it won't freak them out.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have had this app for months and all of a sudden it decides not to work? Telling me this is taking longer then it should try again in a bit? Like no someone needs to fix it...it is happening to mostly everyone with a kindle there's something wrong with the app. So fix it
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of the best movies ever-----they just don't make them like that any more! It's one of our christams traditions, we always watch it before Christmas. How can you not love Chevy Chase?
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|A great game if you like the original star girl, but this star girl is based in Italy. Its a great game!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Originally, I was reluctant to buy this product because I thought &#34;Well, my knife still cuts, why should I need it to cut BETTER?&#34; It wasn't until my jerk-of-a-neighbor decided to &#34;borrow&#34; my machete from my garage at 3 in the morning, did I realize just how badly I needed this piece- wouldn't you know, come 9am, he's hollering that he'd cut off three of his fingers and blaming MY machete for injuring him because it was so sharp.<br /><br />Currently in the process of fighting a lawsuit, but knowing my neighbor can never give me the finger with his right hand is worth all the money in the world. 5 Stars!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It was exactly what I needed nothing more, nothing less. Shows just the basics which makes it easy to use. Just perfect for what I needed.
0375703764|5.0|Protip: Don't let anyone suffering from schizophrenia, schizo-typical, or dissociative personality disorder handle this book. A great read, but now  I need to get grandma to stop reciting the index backward.<br /><br />Otherwise, great read.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Very emotional and relatable. Makes you feel good knowing there are wallflowers out there like Charlie who would understand you and all that you are.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|great late night game for when your unable to sleep, or when your waiting in any line to pass time. enjoyed it right from the start.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|I normally don't like Zombie movies, but this one makes you  think what could happen. Excellent movie and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B006MGDVFM|5.0|A great documentary.  Well put together and a great story.  After watching the new Rush movie, my wife (!) wanted to see more, so we rented Senna, and loved it, too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can't wait for season 4, already watched the first 3 seasons. Very well written and actors are superb. Love my amazon prime!
B002G917ZK|4.0|What more can I say.  This lady was such a classic in every way--appearance, persona, multi-faceted talent.  I so admire and appreciate her life story as well, from her childhood in the terrifying shadow of WWII in Europe to her charitable work with children in 3rd world countries in her last years.
B008Y1NY14|5.0|There is so much to learn as browsers are taking their sweet time to work into CSS3.  I can see where this very large book will be useful to me more in the future than it could be today.<br /><br />The book is written in a manner that I can understand. i'm not pushing it because right now in October 2013, I'm taking advantage of the stalled out browser activity.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|and I was bringing my apple tv from the living room to the bedroom-and in my luggage when I travel...  but now I can leave the apple TV in the living room and tote my Chromecase around with me.  Really great device!  Turns an older non internet tv in an updated device.  Please ask me questions- I love this device!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read these books because my son was wanting to read them.  I wasn't sure what age they were appropriate for.  It was a good read but was my least favorite of the 3.  I guess that often is the case in a series though.  Wrapping up the story line is tough.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I absolutely love this game--have replayed the game from start to finish three times so far--wish sugar sugar 2 was on kindle fire
B000058983|5.0|If you have never listened to this cd or group,as I had not.If you like great music and not just good music, then read the reviews and treat yourself to this cd.You wont be disappointed.....support your favorite artists.

B001NLL93W|5.0|Quite literally my new favorite book, and as an avid reader, that is quite a compliment. I have now read the entire TMA series and have just started TID series. I love the entire story as a whole but this is by far my favorite book by Cassandra Clare. I highly recommend it.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|One of best series. Shameful that there was not 3rd season but I still watched it all and will watch it again.
B008OOYALE|4.0|The time to wait is a bit long but again for a free app, that is to be expected.  The game challenges as are fun and they are always adding more.
1451695195|5.0|The author did an excellent job writing from an Dementia patient persepective.  Having a parent going through this disease, it opened your eyes to how they are feeling during this journey.
B00018D3RI|5.0|Still fun to see again. Has aged fairly well and the relationship between the two leads is impeccable.<br /><br />' nuff said.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love. It!!!!  It works great! It is a great way to pass the time. A must have for every computer.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|Being a huge Doors fan, this was a welcome expenditure for my cd collection.  Almost all of it works. The biggest surprise was that the 'new' song (last one on second disc) wasn't really all that great. Still worth the investment ...
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I had trouble believing the characters were only ten years old. There were some other parts that were not quite believable, but it's fiction. Why do published writers write that people feel nauseous? They, or the editors should know it's nauseated.
B00CNEVII4|4.0|This review is not about the music... 5 star there, obviously-<br />So, on this remaster, first question is... why Redbook & not SACD ?<br />I can only assume that the original tapes were not up to snuff ?<br />I have a very high end system, so resolution on my end, is not the issue-  I would say that this CD has fabulous inner detail, although I'm curious about the outer limits...<br />1st, I have to turn this version up way louder, like an SACD,  though more so (why is that ?)- Also, the frequency extremes seem absent or very limited-<br />I  understand that Steve Hoffman likes to master w/ tube gear, & I also use it myself, so who knows why these issues exist...<br />Don't get me wrong, this CD sounds better than any version I have heard (& I always try to grab the best versions I  know of, of any music I like), I guess I'm just thinking Audio Fidelity could have mastered this a little better, even w/ less than ultimate master tapes-<br />My opinions of course-<br />David
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Word War Z starts with a sort of novel approach to the zombie thing but it never develops into a good story.  Its a zombie movie, so we expect some chasing and chewing but endless combat scenes overwhelm a potentially interesting story line and any acting talent Brad Pitt might lend to the movie.  The cause is revealed too fast and the solution too quick and simple, with the rest of the moving given to action scenes.  This would have been an OK Saturday night SciFi Channel TV movie but for a big screen production with Brad Pitt in the lead it was a total disappointment.  If you are doing a dissertation on the history of zombie movies I guess you will have to watch it, otherwise just go for a rerun episode of Walking Dead.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|A big Drake fan. This cd is so good. Just love it. It's worth buying. Seen him on Ellen and he was excellent
B0094K1PW4|5.0|So far I've watched this one three times.  It is well told scifi  story in the spirit of ET.  It is refreshing that someone can still tell a fantastic story without vulgarity and violence.  Ok there is some minor violence but it is a wholesome movie with characters you like, villans you don't, and a lot of charm.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|This cd is so good. She is better than Selena Gomez. Seen her perform on Kelly and Michael she was excellent. She reminds me of a young Mariah Carey.
B000I0XLYO|4.0|Very Funny! I would very much watch it again, Ben Stiller and the rest of the cast were very funny.
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|I thought Lawrence would make it worthwhile.  Not a chance,  All of the situations had been used in other movies only done much, much better.  I lasted for 1/2 hour.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This covers the basics very well, though I could wish for some more detail in terms of formatting. But then, it's nto written as a guide to html or css, sothat's not really a fault with the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book.  Should be made into a movie.  After reading this, I bought Shift.  Very enjoyable, action packed, great level of detail.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app can help you learn Spanish, Portuguese, French and English very easily. It is like my Rosetta stone on the go for my kindle fire.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very interesting story line. Three different stories blend into one. Psychological mind twisted. Enjoyed every word. Would recommend it to anyone.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragonvale is the best game ever; but 1 thing is ridiculous.  U have 2 use REAL MONEY in order to get certain things.  For example, u need 2 use REAL MONEY to buy DragonCash, gems, DragonTreats, and magic.  It's insane!  I mean, seriously, they expect u 2 fall 4 buying things that don't really matter.  However, it is the absolute BEST GAME on my kindle fire that was free.  All the others crashed.  I got the game a week ago and I'm on level 8 already, I've been playing so much!  Great game, a 'must get'.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book is well written and entertaining.  It's also realistic (to a degree) and develops into several ethical and moral questions as it becomes apparent that all is not what it seems to be.  There are a few stupid moves that I don't believe the characters would have made, but it does raise issues of loyalty beyond reason.  One always wonders &#34;what must the parents be thinking&#34;  when a child becomes embroiled in a crime.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is such a great book.  I highly recommend it to kids(and adults) from ages 9-13.  If you are older than that, you may enjoy it too!  It truly is one of the best books I have ever read.  I was in tears by the end of the book.  Thank you, R.J.Palacio; your book has changed my life.  I now think more about my actions when I'm around kids like Auggie Pullman.  Wonder, you are really a true wonder.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Although there are some areas of this book that could stand to be shortened, it was a very good read and I look forward to reading others by Hugh Howey. Thank you.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I started with City of Bones and proceeded to download every other book immediately. I love them and I am glad I read them before seeing the movie which was okay by movie standards. I'm a little disappointed about how whiney Jace is sometimes but I love him all the same. My fav person so far is Magnus, he's super spunky :)This series is totally worth the read and I am looking forward to the next book(s).
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful from beginning to end. Hard to put down stayed up long nights just to read. Can't wait to read the next book.
B0047SKR54|5.0|Apocalypse Now is a Vietnam classic to watch it in HD 56 inch flat screen and surround sound what an experience
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I never get caught up in a TV series, but this show is the exception to the rule.  AWESOME is not a good enough word for Breaking Bad.  ADDICTIVE is putting it mildly.  Wish it would never end.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I hope they add in a way to blow up tnt but this game is my favorite press yes if you agree
1401323820|4.0|If you want great literature this is not the book to read. If you just want a fun read then this is it!
B00B19DW0E|1.0|Terrible acting and overall plot even by eighties standandards.  This movie is a low even for the likes of Kurt Russell.
B001PP9ALY|4.0|i was very surprise how well this movie was made good CGI and Gun play and love the concept of curving a bullet
B0078XGEK2|5.0|Although gently written, this books shakes all the preconceptions and breaks down all defense mechanisms one may have. Written with honesty, it is a marvelous read, as long as one is willing to change.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought this book was very inspiring... It was very enjoyable to read and you really connect with Charlie and feel for him
B003H4I4JU|5.0|It's a bit slow at first but overall a great book. Explores some interesting questions about morality and survival. It is different then enders game though
B000JPRPAO|4.0|I generally don't like remakes, but this is well done for the genre.  I like Wahlberg's understated style - akin to Burt Lancaster.
B00F5BON8O|5.0|Love her voice and the music accompanying.  We will be watching for more from this artist in the future.  Her live performance is avail on one of the NPR sites and is fabulous also.
B00EQF2EIG|5.0|I love this movie. The words flow beautifully in modern times, even though it was written 400 years ago.<br />Amy Acker is delightful and plays Beatrice with wit, charm and the perfect acrid tongue. It was shot in 12 days in a very modern setting (Joss Weadon's home), carries itself like an modern &#34;party&#34; movie and you feel like you are there too...amazing.
0060832819|5.0|A Review by Anthony T. Riggio of “The Zahir” by Paulo Coelho<br />October 14, 2013<br /><br />My wife had bought this book a couple of years ago and said something about it; implying that she believed it was a book I would like to read.  She never read it. It was discovered again as I was pulling books off my shelf to give to the library funding sale. The book remained unread for about five years and since that time I read the Alchemist and Veronika Decides To Die.  Both were compelling reads for me and I was captivated by Coelho's writing style. To me, it was akin to the complexity of a Faulkner and the simple prose of a Hemingway<br /><br />Let me begin my review by pointing out that there were a lot of low reviews for this book on both Amazon and Goodreads, and I hesitated to begin reading it. As I began reading the book it got my attention because of police involvement and a missing wife and the protagonist being suspected of something criminal. I had no idea of the impact it would have on me as I continued to read.  The author, in my humble opinion is both a scholar and an intellectual and his references to other books lends credence to this conclusion.<br /><br />In The Zahir, the protagonist is a world famous author (perhaps auto biographical) and an author who has traveled extensively throughout the world. A bon vivant who struggles with his art and his wife Esther becomes his inspiration. Because of his self centered view of life and being perhaps a bit misogynistic, his relationship with Esther dwindles and becomes a bit of a struggle for her but he is oblivious to her needs.  She leaves him to travel to war zones as a correspondent and eventually disappear after meeting Mikhail a Kazakhstan native whom she hires to be her translator and guide. Subsequent to Esther leaving he falls into a despair and identifies Esther as his Zahir (obsession).  He becomes so involved with the Zahir, it impacts on everything he does until he meets Maria who inspires him to continue to write.  He produces a book which becomes a top seller but in the process of writing this book becomes aware of his Esther obsession.  He sets out to find Esther through Mikhail, who is this mysterious and perhaps mystical figure who also loves Esther but lets her go because he knows that Esther is searching for something perhaps the thing that prompts her to become a War correspondent and thus leave our protagonist.  We never get his name and when he begins his search for Esther in Kazakhstan, he undergoes a mystical experience where he chooses the name “Nobody” from an ancient story of Ulysses and his search and ultimate return to Penelope.  He is told that his Esther would approve of this “baptism” in the Steppes of Central Asia.<br /><br />The protagonist's struggle through out the book is the realization that he had to undergo a change to be worthy of Esther.  His humility is accented by his chosen name before he meets Esther.<br /><br />Throughout the book I formed an abundance of questions about life, commitment and love, as one can not get into the protagonist's mind without some form of identification.  In some cases I could not identify with his free thinking and his promiscuity and view of women.  He unceremoniously dumps Maria when he sets out on his quest to hopefully reunite with Esther, which he has doubts that she will accept him.<br /><br />The book is well worth the read and I believe at some future time Coelho will be revered and studied like Faulkner, Steinbeck and Hemingway in our universities.  Notwithstanding some low ratings, I gave this book five (5) stars and would have given it more if possible.<br /><br />I wondered too, if his choice of the name Esther did not have some symbolism to the old testament story.continue to write.

B004EPZ07U|2.0|This movie has taken a lot of flak on many different levels. At the same time there are some people who really liked it. I'm not one of them. In the wave of comic book movies that have been flowing through the theaters Green Lantern comes out as a weak and halfhearted endeavor. The pacing is lopsided. The script is weak. Acting is uninspired. Eye candy is about the only thing the movie seems to try to be consistent on, and even there it falls short of the movies it's competing with.<br /><br />There are two big problems with this movie. The first is how the story unfolds. It starts off strong with a good set up for our hero Hal Jordan with character strengths and flaws all rolled up in a tidy bow before he finds a dying alien, who then passes the role of interstellar guardian with powers limited only by your imagination to him. From there the story stays flat. Branching side plots start interesting, then cartoonish. Hal's training story is forgettable. The build up to a planet destroying evil didn't feel like a build up. Worst of all the that was tossed at the beginning of the movie showing some promise for character development was dropped over and over again with some pretty trite script writing keeping our hero on the bench for way too long.<br /><br />Too much focus seems to be on the pretty CG effects, which isn't pretty enough to replace good storytelling. What happens is the action doesn't raise the level of excitement as it seems to rely too much on the special effects. The scenes that are supposed to be dramatic are overdramatic; almost to the point of pulp style. There is no buildup when there should be and there is no plot development that isn't being outplayed by the computer effects and melodrama. But hey, it's a superhero movie. This is about seeing a beloved comic character come to life more than high drama. Well they screw that up too.<br /><br />Green Lantern is a pretty violent film for a freshman introduction to a 40's superhero to the public. Ofcourse other superhero films show violence, but it's all about presentation. A guy gets burned alive. Innocent bystanders are vaporized. And the way this stuff is presented is pretty dark and seems to revel in showing it (another notch against the movie's heavy handed CG fetish). It just seems to be way too much grit too soon for a franchise about a green colored force for good.<br /><br />Acting is mostly uninspiring with a few exceptions. Mark Strong's Sinestro is so spot on I wished the movie would have been about him. Peter Sarsgaard does a good Hector Hammond as well. Clancy Brown gets a shout out for lending his voice to the only good part of the ridiculous Parallax. Special effects are just about on par for a superhero movie, but that's not a good thing when the special effects are the star of the show.<br /><br />You get the theatrical release of the film along with an extended cut with nine minutes of extra footage. Nothing that really makes a difference in this film unfortunately. The movie's package of extras is not bad and is all on high definition. Here's the breakdown:<br /><br />Maximum Movie Mode: Green Lantern's Light - It's essentially a picture in picture with a ton of interviews, featurettes, pop up trivia, bios and more.<br /><br />Focus Points - All of the featurettes from Maximum Movie Mode. &#34;The Art of Green Lantern,&#34; &#34;Weapons Hot: The U.C.A.V. Dog Fight,&#34; &#34;Reinventing the Superhero Costume,&#34; &#34;Ring Slinging 101,&#34; &#34;We Are the Corps,&#34; &#34;Acting Under 10 Pounds of Silicone,&#34; &#34;Guardians Revealed&#34; and &#34;When Parallax Attacks.&#34;<br /><br />The Universe According to Green Lantern - Interviews with comic writers, fans, film crew and executives all talking about the history of the comic and characters.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds Becomes the Green Lantern -  A pretty short featurette on Ryan Reynold's transformation.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes - Less than ten minutes of unfinished footage from five scenes. Nothing worth writing about.<br /><br />UltraViolet Digital Copy - As always with UltraViolet it's not a true digital copy, but a code so you can download it from a website.<br /><br />I think we actually should have a Green Lantern franchise, but the way this has started it may not happen. This movie misses the mark on all the elements that make a good superhero movie. If you are into flashy effects and action you may be like many others and really love this film. If you need more than just a popcorn flick you may as well pass or watch it on TV. Maybe the Green Lantern will be picked up again and reworked to something that's worthy of the title.<br /><br />Justice League #1 Digital Comic - This little bonus is from the new 52 comics relaunch that DC was doing. You get the full digital comic.<br /><br />Preview of Green Lantern: The Animated Series - It's a short preview of the cartoon.<br /><br />PS3 Arkham City Character Skin Code - Pretty cool extra if you have the game and console. It's the Sinestro Corps Batman suit.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Written as life often is...messy, complicated and never going according to plan. This has been one of my favorite books by Sparks.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a very, very cute love story and very hard to put down.  Megan and Connor seemed real and were definitely made for each other. I really enjoyed it!
B005FRF6PC|5.0|Fascinating look inside the mind of one of the greatest tennis players of our time!  Great book, I would recommend it!
B0036EDVS0|2.0|The story was good but there were too many quasi-romantic conversations that were super dull.  I felt anxious for it to end and bored whenever they would start talking.  It was a shame because it was an attractive film.. Not sure if I'd describe it as bad acting, writing, directing, or editing... But it wasn't the tween friendly Halloween themed romp that I was hoping for.
B00846TRHY|5.0|This is an impressive film! A guy goes from being bad to being good by moving to Africa (Sudan) and building a place where children can grow up safely. What makes him different from others like him is his use of guns to defend himself, the kids, and the property. Everywhere he goes, he finds abandoned or kidnapped children. There are stories of children being forced to kill their own mothers and other gruesome cruelties. ... [[ASIN:B00E8AGGZ6 Katarina Nolte]]
B00ELIKDXG|4.0|The Lollipop carries on where Firebird ended and we find ourselves again in Julia Gousseva's wonderful world of stories within stories. Here, Alex, 10, and his sister Katie, 9, discover that they have the power to create stories themselves and not only that, to change the endings, even change history, depending on their own actions. Is it magic or something more subtle and esoteric?<br /><br />What Ms Gousseva is doing is providing morality tales wrapped in the magician's cloak of fairy tales and building an invisible bridge from the cold steppes of her own Russian childhood to the warm deserts of Arizona, her new home and that of her children.<br /><br />This time, we are treated to a talking fish who grants the shocked angler, Emelya, three wishes if he is let off the hook. The wishes granted, Emelya finds himself falling in love with Maria - the Tsar's daughter and winding up in prison. As Alex and Katie get drawn into the narrative, they discover that they have the power to become part of the story and save Emelya - and in ways that teens and pre-teens will find as thoroughly intriguing as I did.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Highly addictive! I wish you received more tokens to play when you win though but other than that, great game!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Loads up slow but I do like the long range forecasts. The radar is a good forecaster for the day.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|It's Alter Bridge.  Is it any surprise that their 4th full length album would be as good as (if not better than) their first three.  They once again continue to live up to the precedent with amazing lyrics, melodies, guitar riffs and just all around good quality,  Totally worth the price and more.
B00F56AZK4|3.0|Good, but I would like more free puzzles and would like to make the puzzles larger. Pictures are nice but would like to see harder ones.
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|Panic! at the Disco has done it again with their original sound, style, and beautifully haunting lyrics! A must for everyone, not just P!@tD fans!
B005HSG3VK|2.0|i thoight it would be more thick and durable.  the black fold over started to fray with in the first week. I guess it holds it purpose until i can buy a better one!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Incredible acting and intriguing writing.  Like layers of an onion, &#34;Fringe&#34; reveals more to the viewer each time you watch it!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Such a great book getting into the mind of ender and the trials he faces. This book is a great read. The only thing I didn't like was the direction the book took at the ending, otherwise it was great.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|As always, Elvis delivers.  With remixes and re-interpretations of previous songs he brings new life to them.  The collaboration with the Roots is great!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|In my opinion this was a great sequel. I have read all of Stephen King's books. Some were amazing, some were just okay, and a few really sucked...Lol. He tied up all the loose ends pretty nicely and told a brand new story as an added bonus.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Drop dead fantastic...  The opening track sounds a bit like Nightwish....then I thought to myself - they should have Tarja guest on a future album.  I think it is great album...they sounds more focused and the yoke has been lifted.  Yes, at parts they sound like - well YES, and Gentle Giant and of course Rush.
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|Very good cast, (never saw a film with Dinero that I didn't like) great car chase, intriguing story.  A film that can be watched every couple of years.
0099443244|4.0|I finally read this book while taking a cross-country flight, and was glad to have finally taken the time to read it. It was a very good book with lots of good advice and real-life scenarios to learn from. I particularly liked the section that encouraged readers to listen to their lucky hunches and the section about maximizing chance opportunities. I am keeping this book as a part of my permanent collection of favorites. Review written by Eddie Coronado, author of the Kindle and paperback book \\"Manifest Your Millions: A Lottery Winner Shares his Law of Attraction Secrets\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Endless fun! I wish they made it a little easier to get character tokens. I love the daily challenge. An altogether great game to play
159562015X|5.0|This is an excellent book which helps a person to assess his or her strengths.  I found it very accurate and helpful.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Best show ever on tv today. wish they would make more tv tie in novels to go along with this
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use the app on both my cell phone (android) and my kindle fire HD.  App works great on both.  Selling items are easy.  I love hearing the cha ching sound it makes when an item has been sold.
B004OBQDHK|5.0|Great movie, it's one of the things that has led me to take up skydiving as a hobby! I don't know how there's people out there that haven't seen this movie
B001NHNG64|5.0|Another excellent read in the Reacher series. Looking forward to the rest of the books. Couldn't put it down. Worth the price!
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|This film is a complete rip off of every single Roland Emmerich film ever made. It feels like a parody of Independence Day, Day After Tomorrow, and 2012. It even had the cliche scene with the bumbling scientist who \\"just so happen to ironically stumble\\" across the solution to killing the Aliens. I almost barfed when i saw that plot line because it was so uninspired. Clearly Del Toro is not the autuer I thought he was and films like Pans Labrynth and Devil's Backbone were just lucky breaks. I can't believe so many people on the net praise this as one of the year's best...they must all be 12 year olds because this film is terrible. It sucks for me because I am a huge Neon Genesis Evangelion and Gundum fan but this difference between those films and this one is that at least those were original, imaginative, creative stories... this film is just the equivalent of a light show...who cares about how great the cgi effects are if the story sucks.And what's with all the so-called \\"actors\\" looking like twilight saga underwear models? They actors are terrible!
B00FN811SY|5.0|I give this app a big thumbs up.  The download was very easy and I look forward to using it every day in the future.
B001QW8QYS|5.0|I would highly recommend this film to anyone interested in early Christian history and Nero. No one could have filled the role of Nero better than Peter Ustinov.
0060776757|5.0|It was even better then I imagined!  So thorough.  It told me stories that as a huge U2 fan, I didn't know.  And it was great that it was from their perspective.  With their own words.  If you are a U2 fan, you have to buy this book!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It makes me think and want to finish the game. That may not happen, but I will still try to.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I have trouble getting it to start, I have to tap my screen ALOT to get it to run and then it is slow until the game starts
B0042H6VY6|4.0|great selection, one big song missing Let's make lots of money, but in general great selection for Pet Shop Boys
B00506NRBS|5.0|How do you get from where you are to where you want to be?  And how do you do it while being true to yourself and those around you?  And what's important in the world of business and interactions?  Sivers goes deep, quickly and well, and he really makes sense out of what we see around us day to day.  I'm grateful that Seth Godin recommended this on his excellent blog.  I will read it more than once.
B000IFQLLY|4.0|CD is good, one BIG mistake: at the end of the song Enjoy the silence, after a few seconds of silence the band is stating the title of the song by saying out loud &#34;Enjoy the silence&#34;. Well this part is missing on this CD.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Wow! Not only did I love the storyline but I loved his writing style!!! Great story. I also wish I could have one of these doctors look at my feet and have someone make me into the best runner I could be.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very good i wasnt sure I would enjoy it until I started reading it then I couldn't put it down.
B004LWZW24|5.0|Love this movie and it was here before it was suppose to be. It's a scary movie but funny.  Love
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Turned out to be far more useful than anticipated and would recommend to anyone with a similar need to the manufacturer's stated use.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great post apocalyptic story. Can't wait to read the rest of the books. Hopefully they're as good as the first.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|As one of the originators in the field, LinkedIn has always delivered top value and is well worth the effort in setting up. Only caution would be to make careful selection of update notices. Folks are very attentive to circulating those updates.
B0017MO10U|5.0|If you are a fan of Richard Dean Anderson, then this is a must for the collector.  See the futuristic McGyver in action.
B0074V3712|5.0|Definitely not an easy read. The first half of the book is a most dense exploration of  the rarity of social organization  in the world's biology, rarity of any social organization in invertebrates or vertebrates. Once through this material, the author turns to the near impossibility of social organization in mammals and discusses the genetic basis of all life. Wilson is very certain that there is no possibility of anything in the nature of a creator being or any non physical matter of any kind. According to Wilson,the universe is absolutely atheistic. The book is definitely a graduate level text and one intended to convince the reader that all existence is purely physical. He does exhibit considerable hostility toward all religion.
B000002H3E|5.0|This is a must have for the Big Rock Hair Band music collector. This CD was a hit during my youth and I had to ensure it is part of my collection again.  I also sent this CD to my son and daughter.  They love it!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|My sister recommended I read this book by telling me she wanted to start running again. Knowing sis I grabbed a sample from Kindle and ended up buying it after reading just a few pages. That was yesterday. I couldn't put it down. I started highlighting research and doing my own investigating into the science carefully woven throughout the story. As an exercise physiologist and OR nurse I was amazed. As a humanist I was enthralled. This will become a classic I recommend to others helping change their lives. I know it has changed mine. I am headed out for my first run in 20 years. I bought into  the fear mainstream marketing and media has pedaled to Americans. This book will open your heart and mind to reach back to our roots. We are The Running Species on the planet. Thank you Christopher for being YOU and sharing with US to help people all become WE.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is a must for movie collectors. I do not care who you are but this classic gets played or watched at the very least annually by everyone.
0544002318|4.0|Scott is really good in writing in a way that you think anybody can be as good as he is. He explains how he had to battle his whole life to reach the top form he is now, and how long did it take... his change to veganism, and raw vegan, back again to vegan... seems normal, fluid, in a way that anybody could do it... again, with the ultramarathons... he says in a very simple way, anybody who wishes to be an ultrarunner just need practice, a good diet and discipline, that is it...<br />really exciting!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A cross between the wagon train of the old west, futuristic battle between good and evil, and science fiction rolled into one.  Too bad there was only this season.  A must for scifi collectors.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The world needs to hear this!  Thanks for helping me to tune into myself. I really love books, but Kindle's prices encourage me to read more.
B0018O4YSQ|3.0|This is a must for the genre movie collectors. An interesting movie which sparked &#34;the Matrix&#34; series of movies.  A must see for a unique perspective.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This is not a feel-good story about American history, but it is a tale of the depravity of money and power. It has a happy ending, but it's hard not be affected by the violence and abuse. The story is well written and is an action adventure western with heroic characters. The acting is excellent throughout the film. I was engaged and entertained, but I'm not sure I would want to watch it again, because of the harsh realities it exposes.
B0017VG69U|5.0|I especially like the crisp new look although I can go back an see the original viewing as these episodes were aired.  Excellent buy!
B004RJMUJO|3.0|When I tried to launch the app, it immediately force closed. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, same result. I cleared data (even though I hadn't been able to use the app yet), still no go. I uninstalled, rebooted my phone, then reinstalled the app, it still didn't work. I then tried the app on my Galaxy S2 (rooted, Jelly Bean), and it worked. So, I was never able to get it to even load on my stock Galaxy S4 4.2.2. I have sent an email to the developer, but I am not holding my breath for any type of help from them.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter who loves it.  She is a fan of this series and told me that all fans should own this one.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Device: (Stock) Samsung Galaxy S4 Android 4.2.2<br /><br />The game starts off relatively easy. I was having a lot of fun with it. It is a mix of a match 3 sort of game. You match tiles, but they are not in rows. The tiles are hexagonal, and the playing field is not square, so they just have to be touching. The longer the chain the better. You have to turn all of the tiles blue, then you get a piece of a Talisman to the bottom of the playing field in order to finish that puzzle. Once you get all of the pieces of that Talisman, you go on to a harder level. There are steel tiles, ice - where the tile is under ice, to you need to break an item next to it in order to break the ice, and tar covered tiles where the tile is under spreading tar. You have to break an item next to it quickly, or the tar spreads to tiles next to it. There are also wildcards where you can string together any two types of tiles. It is sort of timed in that if you break a tile that is already blue, you start to fill up a meter, and once that meter is full, you lose that level. The game starts off pretty easy and gets progressively harder.<br /><br />Options: You can turn down/off both the music and sound. Links to Facebook and Twitter only go to their pages, you do not post any game progress online. There are instructions, and you can also click to see other games made by this developer. When you click on play, you have the option to choose from Adventure Mode and Survival Mode. By pressing your back button, you are asked if you want to quit the game.<br /><br />Permissions: Full network access, view network connections. You can turn off your data/wifi or turn on airplane mode, and the game works fine.<br /><br />Size: App 26.03 MB, I am not sure about the ability to move to the SD card, since the S4 does not have that ability on Jelly Bean.<br /><br />Overall, I do like this app. There are no in app purchases, no blaring ads for other games by the developer, and I did not experience any bugs while playing. Younger kids may have trouble with strategy, and the upper levels do get much harder, but it is an enjoyable game. My screen seemed plenty big, as did my S2. Solid app, and I would recommend it.
B000002LK1|5.0|This CD was a hit during my youth and I had to ensure it is part of my collection again.
B005OYKI1I|4.0|I paid for this movie on a Friday night and it was show on TBS on Saturday. I think it needs to be moved to the free list for Amazon Prime
B0010YSD7M|5.0|If you are a fan of Richard Dean Anderson, then this is a must for the collector.  See the futuristic McGyver in action.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I have totally enjoyed this book and I definitely look forward to reading more. I was kept in suspense with this story. Jamie and Claire were meant to be together.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I find it hard to believe that one would go to the great lengths to catch a thief and never could see the changes in the man who committed a petty crime from years ago. An enjoyable classic read.  It is possible for people to change despite their past.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Most of my friends  have this app i got it around july and it works awesome! Especially because  i dont have a cell phone. Fast, easy to use, just plain old awesome, and it says when the other person is typing so u know that they get your message. I love this app!!!
B000F8O2PG|5.0|If you are a fan of Richard Dean Anderson, then this is a must for the collector.  See the futuristic McGyver in action.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I was looking for a customizable alarm. I wanted to be able to wake up to my favourite music and whatnot. And here is the perfect app for it. Definately worth downloading.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I downloaded it back accident , but it is actually really fun for my daughter. I love it ! And I would recommend it to anyone.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This book is very informative to people who are interested in learning more about English pronunciation and definitions that have been created
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I could hardly put this book down! I stumbled a bit over a few bits here and there, such as the servant Joseph's speech, a tad hard to follow, but I figured it out after a while. The ending was well worth the struggle!
B00F9040HU|2.0|The game was hard to rate when i didn't have enough to play for free!  Need to allow more time.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I have played this game for a while and I really like it. On 3 separate occasions right after purchasing chips the game would freeze up and I would not get my chips. The first time they were credited back. The last 2 times they didn't. I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM THIS GAME, EVER!!!!!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Love the game. Plays very well on my kindle fire. I have not had any problems so far. Great with friends.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I am not a hardcore &#34;trekkie,&#34; but have seen all the TV shows and movies and always liked them.  This is a good installment to the story.  Lots of fun action and great casting.  More good stuff if you know the rest of the shows and movies.
B005D6O12O|3.0|The shoe fit fine accept they are too narrow across the instep.  I did not discover that until I had wore them a couple of hours.  Suddenly the comfortable shoe started to hurt and my feet started to swell.  Either buy them too big or wear them less than two hours.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|I could not find it on my KindleFire HD. Guess I will keep looking. I don't recommend unless you're very savvy.
B000OLROWC|5.0|As good today as it was when I was a kid.  Campy but heartwarming.  I still use the &#34;Karate do yes, Karate do no&#34; speech to this day.
B000I0XLYO|3.0|This movie was about what I expected, a silly stupid movie, something I had on in the background while doing some monotonous work.  If you like Ben Stiller, watch it, if you are looking for a really good movie, move on.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I love when my son can't contain his laughter, and this movie had us both going. Funny, and some good teaching points in there for parents who prefer to have productive TV viewing time.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|This was a good way to read the start of all the vampire novels.  It was a little hard to read the old language but still a good read
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed reading about the lives of the people who will never know how exposing secrets could have changed their lives drastically.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|May be depressing - may also be uplifting - certainly makes you think about which it is.  Not light fiction.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Hilarious and brutal, with two doses of snark added in. Malkovich made me howl. After this week in politics, I'm betting Hollywood got this one right.
B00992CF6W|2.0|people raved.......well I should have known better.  too fiddly.  too clunky looking.  too much learning curve.  to darn boring.  happy i didnt spend much.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I thought it was fun, and the seven-year old niece loved it. Reasonable for all ages. Silly, with a few references added in for older generations.
0817439390|3.0|I bought this book to complement my first bridge camera purchase. The information is useful but the text is so long and small it makes the book boring and arduous. However, the example photos are nice. I wanted to make this part of collection unfortunately I don't believe it will be. Right now I'm liking Better Photo Basics by Jim Miotke.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Silly romance novel.  The author tries to weave a mystery in to the story, but it is not very deep.
B0033AI48Y|5.0|This is my favorite movie, I have seen it many times, but this time the picture was just beautiful, the color was brilliant and I felt like I was seeing this picture for the first time.
B00EMAGCJM|4.0|The wait is finally over! I have been eagerly awaiting this release for some time now, i was not sure wut she had in store soundwise considering how different the 2 singles were and i knew not to expect an album full of \\"we cant stop\\" and was very happy when i heard how diverse this collection of songs is. There is a bit of filler songs on here but the great songs are great and the filler is even better than some peoples music nowadays! I love love love My Darin, her duet w Future,shows her vocal abilities and knack for duets. The first song Adore You starts out the album on a mellow note and is the beginning of the relationship that the story of this cd is. We Cant Stop is next we have all heard it so no need to comment! I like the duet w Britney Bangerz, generic lyrics but the song works. Drive is prob my second fav on this collection her voice,lyrics, melody everything is awsome. F U and Do My Thang are other highlights and the 3 bonus songs on the deluxe edition are good but not necessary to hear and appreciate Bangerz. All in all im very excited for this to finally be out dont expect anything just go in and listen to the music not the image that is her promo for this new stage in her career NICE WORK MILEY , a new fan Andrew
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I think there are a lot o Ender's in the world. Very few are found in the military. I think most are in sports, or entertainment. I've watched my son and his friends play video games on 4 sreens at once, and I doubt many adults are capable of even remotely understanding what is going on, much less keep pace.  Ender's Game captures all these dynamics, and is very surprising as well!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great app to use within minutes I had 11gigs of space get this before you don't have enough space
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|Wife loves it. Don't mind watching it myself. Good twist and acting. Hope the series keeps continuing for the next couple of seasons.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Game is good until it messes up & takes your stuff.  Needs fixing.  They need to fix the errors that occur when you are in a setting that causes you to lose time, coins and your place in the game.<br /><br />Y
B00DDXJRJG|2.0|All it does is reduce the other bands, so boosting the bass (or treble) makes it difficult to hear the other parts of the sound.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable me minon rush is a Great game, fun to play, runs smooth and is great for the whole family.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great series, edgy, smart and funny!  Suits is a cutthroat means to an end in fast paced NY style. A must see!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|OMG. So I got hipped to this when I went to visit my friend in TX. I thought it would be great for see the movies I Have on Instaplay on Netflix. It would eliminate the hassel of having to plug my computer into my TV. But I c an do so much more than that. I love the fact that I can project anything that I am working on while use the Chrome brower onto my TV. This is an awesome product.
B008LODRT8|4.0|I thought this book was the best of the 3.  The character of Christian was developed the most here and really the character of Anna.  I read some reviews that felt that she was a pushover, but I think that some of that is her character development.  This book really shows how the two main characters change together.  I really love the way that the book ends.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I could not full get into this book. I thought it would be at least a little humorous but the attempts at being funny felt short for me.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It is a lot of fun and you learn while doing it!! I would recommend it to anyone that needs a little more help with learning a language.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|the quality was really good and im going to continue to buy shows from amazon because it got into my acceptation
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Google Chromecast is a slick little inexpensive device that works very well at streaming media to a TV or HDMI monitor, but it only works with apps that were designed to support it (like Chrome, Netflix and YouTube). At the current time, this is rather limited, so you can't stream music, pictures or videos stored on your phone or tablet. I expect this will improve with time as more developers add support for it.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Fun but not great.<br />The ending was a let down and a distinct change of pace from the rest of the movie, which was a wild ride.<br />Worth renting
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Good kid movie, but also fun for adults. We will watch this movie over and over, full of laughs for everyone.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|It's rough, especially towards the end, and it really could have been better overall. However the strong performance of Angelina Jolie and my own soft spot for globe trotting teasure hunts makes this one I'm happy to pop in from time to time. In a world without enough female action heroes, Lara Croft holds her own even if the movies she's been in so far are only OK.
B00EQRPFGC|5.0|All of John Legends work is amazing and moves me! He is an excellent artist and this song is Superb!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|kept very close to the book, watched the whole first season at once! Couldn't take a break:) only to refill my iced tea
B00BV1OT0O|5.0|Found this after seeing Despicable Me 2 with my nephew. Very colorful and sturdy.  Looks very cute as a display.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|To any lover of beautiful cinema who has NOT seen Barry Lyndon.......You are missing a JEWEL!<br />This will also allow you to see Ryan O'Neal in a perfect role....see Paper Moon, too.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I bought season 1 and loved it! My husband and I like season two so far as well. I'll keep buying the dvds as long as they're good and the cost doesn't go any higher.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|Let’s put it this way – Gravity is now in my top three favorite films of all-time. Previously my top three were The Empire Strikes Back, L.A. Confidential and Casablanca. Gravity is now in that top three, although it’s spot is being internally debated. It’s that good.<br /><br />If you haven’t seen the trailers for it, the film is about a group of astronauts who are hit by satellite debris and have to fight for survival. If you’ve seen the trailer, you’re aware how intense Gravity looks. Well, it lives up to the expectations and then exceeds them by leaps and bounds.<br /><br />Gravity is without a doubt, the single most intense, beautiful and (literally) breathtaking film I’ve ever seen. I’ve been a huge fan of director Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n ever since I saw Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban, my first taste of his amazing style and vision. I was further convinced of his masterful sense of filmmaking after seeing Children of Men and his breakthrough Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n. Cuar&oacute;n not only has fantastic style, but one of his trademarks are now incredibly long single take tracking shots. Most people don’t notice long, single takes and that there isn’t a cut if it’s done well.<br /><br />Gravity continues this incredible feat with a 17 minute opening shot! It’s a remarkable feat and you become absolutely lost in the film seconds into it. It’s a breathtaking film filled with some of the most beautiful cinematography in recent memory. Sandra Bullock plays the heroine Ryan Stone in a riveting performance. I haven’t seen a more worthy Oscar performance yet this year. George Clooney, as Matt Kowalski, is also great, adding a sense of humor and calm to a chaotic situation.<br /><br />Arguably most impressive about the film, is it’s attention to detail and realism. Yes, it’s a work of fiction and some scientific artistic merits were taken to advance the story, but ultimately it stays true to the realities of space. No sound. No gravity. No oxygen. Life can not exist there. These truths constantly run through your mind as you watch the characters struggle and fight for survival. The musical score is powerful and terrifying, amping up the reality of the scenes unfolding before you. I was clenching my armrest and reminding myself to breath throughout the film.<br /><br />It is without a doubt, a remarkable piece of filmmaking. If you’re able to handle the intense and nerve-rattling story, it’s an absolute must see. Just remember to breathe.<br /><br />NOTE: I saw it in 3D and on a huge screen. If you’re able to see it in 3D, you really should. It isn’t gimmicky 3D, it just adds astounding depth to a visually remarkable film.gen. Life can not exist there.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a good book - definitely a page-turner - the only drawback for me was it's based in Australia so it was completely relate-able due to different expressions, seasons, etc. I do recommend it!
B004FP1WX0|4.0|I think that the reason why this documentary and the TV show is so well-liked is that so many people can relate to it.  With social media now being the most popular way for strangers to meet, most everyone who has ever chatted online with someone has had experiences of either being \\"catfished\\" or knows someone who has.  Years ago, a very good friend of mine was \\"catfished\\" by someone claiming to be a celebrity.  She ended up very hurt and betrayed by someone who just wanted attention.<br /><br />The internet is a place where people can be as anonymous as they choose to be, and a way for some people to be able to come out of their shell and/or be whatever and whoever they want to be.  It is important that people realize that having a public profile online can be a way for frauds to steal your pictures and information and pass them off as their own.  I am often amazed at the amount of information people freely give about themselves online, including their phone number!  This is why I am not friends with anyone online that I don't already personally know.  It's just too risky.  I've had a lot of random Facebook friend requests from strangers, and I ignore them all.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|The story and acting were disappointing. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I thought I might enjoy the visual aspects of it, but even they were a let down.  Don't waste your money.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book was so much better then the first, I loved it! The story line was GREAT and kept you intrigued the entire way though the book. No more taking forever to get into the book this one had you from page one.
B001706I5I|3.0|Ron Howard.  Successful in keeping the artistic flow of Carrey's overacting in check to deliver a film that solidly meets your expectations.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This had all the action that will make it one the best Star Trek movie since the 4th one with the whales.
B0074AGVWK|4.0|A lesson for all mothers of adult children still living at home<br />It's an important subject but Binchy always injects comedy into her story
B009RH973I|5.0|I did buy the case based on the fact that it was a) pink (which is the most important factor) b) affordable and c) I was worried tossing the kindle in my purse would lead to it getting scratched up at some point. I've had the case for about a month and it serves it's purpose and I do like the stand option since I do read a lot in bed and tend to drop the kindle on my face. I was a little worried when some reviews said it makes the kindle overheat but I've used it a lot reading and playing games for hours at a time and didn't have any problems.
B00FJTYDKK|2.0|The acting and animation were fine, but the script was paper-thin. The entire movie is just a series of visual and slapstick gags with an overlay of sappy music. At times it felt like I was watching a Saturday-morning cartoon or a direct-to-DVD show.
B000GWE44U|5.0|I am a huge fan of this movie. . Mind blowing cinematography created by a true genius... a must have if you don't all ready
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This is my third Seiko Automatic watch in 20 years, you can't go wrong with one of their Automatic watches.
B0049MAXQG|5.0|Really good if your a fan of the original movie.. still a really good scare, even after all these years....
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Umm... well I like it but, it needs to be funnier<br />Make sure it gets funnier so that it attracts more readers
014242921X|5.0|Now I see why he won the Nobel Prize for literature. A timeless classic. I would recommend this book to anyone that desires to have a better understanding of themselves and others.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have a Chromecast for every TV in my house. It will be the Ultimate device once Amazon supports it.
B00BSBR9N6|3.0|The writing is very good, the story itself - socially awkward man approaching middle age seeks to find a \\"suitable\\" wife through unconventional scientific ways, is predictably drawn to a woman his complete opposite and seemingly unsuitable but turns out to be just right - is a predictable one , just told in an unconventional way.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br />Hmm, I was strangely bored  for the first 15 or so chapters.  I didn't care about a great deal that was happening for the father project, and because you knew what would happen- the wife/Rosie project was also difficult to care about.  I did find myself waiting for glances of who Don's best friend was having an affair with that week (do people still do this with the amount of stds rampant?), but equally glad that by the end he was attempting to mend his ways.  Knowing where the story was headed, hindered my interest so much, I just finally read the end first, and went back to read the middle so I could understand how everything got to the predictable end.  That is the only thing that saved this rating from being lower.<br /><br />Don Tillman is a stunningly realistic character who a close friend of mine mirrors, not a character on a TV show - so some of the \\"funny\\" things were not funny to me at all. He has no personal relationship with his wife or children even though that was once an exciting possibility. The Asperger's won. Divorce is out of the question on his end, he lives with his family almost as a guest with an extended stay. He has his own room, dinner and laundry are provided. The rest of the family can develop relationships - he cannot or is no longer willing to try.  A sad ending to a once hopeful dynamic.  Also, to think someone who seems to have Asperger's would take on change in the ways Don did - very difficult to believe for me.<br /><br />I want to say that if this book shows anything it's that we don't all have to be alike and it is totally ok to give a 3 star review of what so many others felt was a 5 star read. The only way you'll truly know what your heart will feel is if you read this for yourself.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ it is a great passer by game for time nd I love the mini games on it they are really really fun and story line is awesome.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Benedict Cumberbatch was great as the main villain. I took off one star because I thought the script could be a tighter to keep the flow of the movie smoother. I thought the first Star Trek was much better, but this sequel was entertaining. This is a definite rent/buy.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|the game looks good like its cool because you get to fly i didnt get it yet but by the cover it looks good
B004P8JPS6|3.0|Interesting read, but some of plot is a little unrealistic - like science fiction. Recommend to all Lee Child fans.
B0064MGU98|3.0|Kind of Nancy Drew-ish. Have you seen Damages? Now that's amazing. My friend says Good Wife gets better with every season, and it's good enough to stick with it to kill time while on the tread mill.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|I am officially addicted to this runner game!! Run past zombies for as long as you can, collect weapons to kill zombies as you run past them, and level up for better weapons and perks. If you happen to get caught though, the zombie will eat you!<br /><br />Very fun game!
1476727651|3.0|The story starts off slow but its picking up. Characters are very interesting keeps you interested in the story Im reading book at work makes overnight shift go faster.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game has enough variations of the scenes to make it continually interesting.  There seems to be some elements of logic or strategy to clearing some of the scenes.
B005T87QCI|4.0|Ok so me my cousin and my brother are freaking addicted to this game you absolutely NEED to get this game !!!!! :) :) :) :)
B009PMEEY2|3.0|This game you match the items.  Towards the end, it is impossible to get the star for that level.  I guess I liked it enough to play it twice.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game entertaining ,leaves you wanting more . Hated it to be over . What's next. Can't wait for part two three and so on
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I was very impressed with the level of 'simple complexity' in this game.  It played perfectly on my Kindle Fire.  A phone too small and a larger tablet too large.  I am extremely pleased with what was delivered for the cost.  Great Job.
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|Dont waste your money on this cow. She used too be good. Makes me very sad what she is now.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|This one is right up my alley.. and its one more where you have to really look, and then look again. Its Halloween like and to me that is so cool, my BD is right around Halloween and there for its one of my favorite holidays. Amazon is my favorite place to shop any more, such a variety of things.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|the game wont even let me install it and it is pissing me off!!!!!! kindle wont even let me download it and kindle is pissing me off!!!!!!!
B009V5KI98|5.0|I hadn't seen this in years, so we just rented it. All of my children enjoyed it. We had to buy the soundtrack! Such great songs, sweet story. Still a great movie!! Way better than the newer version.
B00FPH3YQA|4.0|It's a very funny movie it kept me laughing and waiting for the next joke I hope they make another one
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Finally a series where the brain is on stage.  Smart...Cleaver....Strategic and excellent use of critical thinking skills.  Only critical comment is the use of _OD Damn...I never have appreciated the use of this expression especially from cerebral people.  Otherwise, we love this show!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I downloaded this game because I like to search for hidden items. If you enjoy hidden item games this game is for you. The only thing I don't like about this game is searching in the darkness.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I'm  very interested in world war two so I really like this app because it's almost like I can really re enact the battles!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great acting and writing. Truly the best series to come along in a very long time. Juliana Margulies is simply outstanding. There are so many storylines available that I hope it will stay around for a few more seasons.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Karl Urban is outstanding. The story line is very interesting, nicely filmed and directed. Would love to see a sequel.
0345525558|5.0|Very well written account of a young girls journey from forster care to adulthood. I couldn't put it down! I highly recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very original and full of surprises, always left me needing to know what would come next. Shoot! I've been up all night finishing it and I'm about to buy the next one!
1587143879|5.0|Although I am not a native english speaker, this book is very well written and organized, even for those who are buying this book as his or her primary/first textbook for the certification.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Could not put it down. I am hoping for another series with the heroes of Olympus
1594204217|5.0|Did not want to put it down. I felt like I was alongside the author as he explored the four cooking methods.
B003DDKAT2|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over.Almost makes me wish there were vampires.What a great story and the cast was perfect.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|Works fine on my Kindle HD Fire 8.9!  I have only used a few times but I have had no problems.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it...the daily devotionals, all the different translations, it is very user friendly and I use this app every single day
B007N8RULO|4.0|You can't go wrong if you want a basic game of Spider.  No fancy cards or backgrounds.  But has 'hints' and 'undo' and all the essentials.  The cards may look a little DOS-like, little blurry.  BUT, fun game if you just want to concentrate on winning the game.  Doesn't keep your best scores, but no big deal.
B008P1EWIM|1.0|It sets the location, a place I never heard. And there is no way to input a location I choose to know about, weather wise. I want my money back! Failing that, I want an app that tells me weather info I can use.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I give this a 5 star because its fun and great for kids and I don't think there's a game that can beat this game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a good book. I highly recommend it for people into dystopians. The book is thrilling and sad and leaves you with a cliffhanger at the end
B004W1GCNC|4.0|This show is very good and well acted.  It is so much better than the original series it is based on.
B0001CCY7E|2.0|It sounds like they used a lot of the music left on the cutting room floor.  I probably will never play it again.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|If you like period pieces like Great Expectations you will like this show. The acting is very good and the scripts well written and interesting.
B0002U0UKS|1.0|It has only three tracks on it and you can get them for free off of the internet with only a little effort.
B003O86FMW|5.0|WHAT A CLIFF HANGER!!! Now onto Mockingjay! This is definitely a page turner like the previous book! I can't believe what is transpiring! I love Katniss' attitude towards the capital, president and situation that she finds herself in. I would have never guessed that this is what the sequel would encompass, especially the ending...wow!!!
B00BB8Q1RQ|5.0|But stayed for the beautiful story. What a great film. Now I really want to read the book. McGuire was brilliant.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|This is my &#34;go to&#34; music on down days.  I play it over and over it never fails to lift my spirits! Thank you, Paul Simon.<br /><br />Maureen A. Gallagher
B00BZAJMWG|3.0|I watched this and really didn't think it was that great.  It's a passable movie about people breaking out of their own prisons and moving up to a new level, however that is being really generous in reviewing it.  The story line was rather generic and the acting was OK but not to the high level I had expected given that all of the major performers were nominated.  I have to say I thought Bradley Cooper was the best given the manic intensity of his character.<br /><br />All-in-all this was a decent movie but not deserving of the major acclaim it received.  Not bad but you can wait for it to come to cable or TV.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|This book is the pivot point for Reacher's journey from military lifer to a hitch-hiking wanderer. A really great read!
B005PK57IK|5.0|All the plots and all the characters are intriguing to watch.<br /><br />Character presence and development is authentic.<br /><br />We especially enjoy the reappearance of quirky larger-than-life characters from time to time<br />who arrive to complicate things or just upset the flow of things temporarily.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the graphics are great. the characters are adorable and u have goals throughout the game. you will definitely love this game so buy it. its free anyways.
B0012CH350|5.0|Excellent fit, high quality material. Anticipate its lasting several years even in the Southern California sun. (Must add 4 more words - apparently conciseness is not appreciated.)
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I got this app hoping I might be able to learn a little Italian, considering I'm going to Italy in two months. I have only had it two weeks and I'm retaining so much of this beautiful language. If you are going to get any app for learning a language, I suggest this one. Considering how hard it is for me to focus and how hard it is for me to learn new things, this app is amazing. The only downside, and I really do only think there's one, is the fact that the first few lessons expect you to know the grammar of the language, which is frustrating. But I took notes and carefully wrote down everything  I learned, and so far it's going great :) I suggest this app if you want to learn a language and actually enjoy it!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I am a Nelson DeMille fan, as well as a John Corey fan, but the latest John Corey book disappointed me. It was set in Yemen, which was a definite geographical turn-off. I hate hot desert areas. I also didn't like how the location and the espionage aspects to the book seemed to me to invite racist feelings. I thought that a lot of the stuff about the culture is true... but he-man stories about killing the &#34;bad guys&#34; certainly plants negative images of an entire country, and does nothing to promote a willingness to find a way for different cultures to co-exist.<br /><br />The subject manner was so serious, the setting was stark, and Kate's role was minimalized due to the severe cultural restrictions on woman. This minimized the humor and banter between John and Kate that is so essential to my enjoyment of this series.<br /><br />I hope that in the next book, they either stay in New York, or get posted to a new North American City. How about DC?
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Very unexpected but a wonderful surprise. Definitely a show that gets you hooked, great suspense and story line. I certainly will be watching all of the following seasons
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|Mae Holland has just started to work in the Customer Experience Department at \\"The Circle\\". She is eager to fit in and believes she is lucky to be working \\"for the only company that really mattered at all\\". When she steps into the elevator she is greeted with a holographic image of her name and high school yearbook photo.  The campus has every possible perk to keep the employees working and hanging out day and night - caf&eacute;s, gyms, outdoor recreation, concerts, club meetings, beer bashes, etc.<br /><br />The Circle appears to be a composite of every social media and ecommerce company you can name - Facebook, Google, Twitter, MySpace, Amazon, Flickr, Yahoo, Yelp, Reddit, et al.  The most dominant and ubiquitous tools offered by the Circle are free, but you have to use them as yourself, your \\"TruYou\\". The era of false identities, multiple user names and internet trolls is over. Mae's job consists of monitoring multiple screens on her desk and answering a deluge of customer questions as deftly and quickly as possible. The Circle takes pride in the fact that the customer queries are not answered by a robot. Mae's output is measured on the quantity of responses that she handles as well as the customer rating on the usefulness of her responses. She starts to believe that her work is important and meaningful.<br /><br />Soon after arriving at the Circle, Mae also discovers that it's not sufficient to just sit at her desk and respond to customers; she is also expected to participate in the community aspects of the Circle and maintain a visible on-line presence. She becomes obsessed with increasing her PartiRank (participation rank) by attending functions, posting pictures and zings,  commenting on everything around her, reading others feeds, etc.  It's an exhausting, all-consuming but at times exhilarating environment that Mae thrives in. She soon reaches the lofty status of the T2K (top 2,000) among the 11,000+ Circlers - a group almost maniacal in their social activity and elite in their corresponding followers. Her days are a relentless cycle of smiles, frowns, comments, votes, surveys and other on-line interactions.<br /><br />One of the products promoted by the Circle is a live feed from a camera worn around the neck that broadcasts at all times until the Circler turns it off at bedtime. Mae feels privileged to have been selected to wear one, and completely buys into the mantra of total transparency and sharing espoused by The Circle.<br /><br />Mae eventually clashes with her parents and old boyfriend, Mercer, who decry the social mania that has infected Mae. Mercer accuses her of having been brainwashed by a cult, but she thinks he's a backwards bore who just doesn't understand the value of complete transparency and sharing. She truly believes the company motto: \\"Sharing is Caring\\".<br /><br />Eggers has written Mae as a one-dimensional character, a pawn in a social structure that has lost its moral compass. None of the characters in the novel are particularly realistic or likeable, but their one-dimensionality seems to emphasize their loss of some basic human element.<br /><br />I raced through the book, and could hardly bear to put it down. Indeed, the story is far-fetched, but with a certain ring of truth and a message of the dystopian future that awaits us if monopolistic companies become too powerful and we allow our humanity to be subsumed by technology. Intrigue builds throughout the novel until a \\"show down\\" of sorts, though it wasn't the climactic resolution that I was expecting.<br /><br />Eggers is a skillful and insightful writer, one of the most articulate social commenters of our time. He has created a fantasy world of on-line \\"sharing\\" gone awry. You can either scoff at it as far-fetched fiction, or regard it as a prophetic warning of the shape of our future.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|So easy to use. Very helpful for making sure my two toddlers are appropriately dressed for the weather before leaving the house.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very entertaining, costumes are beautiful, the house and grounds are lovely.  Acting is very, very good.  My family really enjoys the show.
6304873441|5.0|i collect VHS's of movies that came out in my youth. Totally worth the buy. this movie is not entirely true.
0451530845|3.0|This book has so much content that is related to the Gothic novels/style that if you're not familiar with that, you don't understand and/or can't relate to many of the references or find it humorous.  I'm crazy about most of Austen's works, but not this one.  I like to re-read books that I enjoyed the first time around, but when I re-read this one, I find myself skimming over lots of it, especially once they are actually at the Abbey.  I'd like to see the movie version[s] of the story and maybe that would make it more enjoyable for me to read, having some faces and scenery to visualize.  I don't seem to be able to do that with reading the book, and that's not typical for me; usually reading a book is like watching a movie in my head if the book is good.  If I were to rank Austen's books in order of my favorites, they would be: Pride & Prejudice, Persuasion,  Mansfield Park, Sense & Sensiblity, Emma, Northanger Abbey.
1423136802|5.0|this book series is awesome. full of adventure. all the books together in one package. if a light read is what you're looking for here it is.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Completely in character, which is why I have come to enjoy the entire Reacher series. I doubt they will ever get it right in film. I hope they do not try again. I simply cannot wait to see where the Reacher series ends, as it one day must. But is not that the mark of any great series? We can't wait to see what's next, knowing that one day, there will be no next.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|This movie is a must see. Emma Stone really good actress,. Has humor and romance. I liked it very much. It's a must see!
B000IMUYJM|4.0|I saw this with my husband and another couple when the movie first came out. It was the first time we ever saw a movie that you never really saw the killer and at the end you still didn't know who the killer was. Most movies always end with a wrap up  but this one left you guessing. The remake of this movie was crap and didn't have the same impact as this did when it first came out. I actually bought this for my 9 year old granddaughter after she watched it with me. She loved that there was all the mystery as to who the real killer was, she's a scary movie fan like her mom and grandma.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|It does not follow the storyline to the book. No movie does. it is well made and totally recommend it if you watch it with an open mind,

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|great game but it will not down load for some odd reoson I think its because its a brand new game and that's y its free
B009XIXVU6|4.0|My book club read this.  I thought it was great but some other ladies thought it was hard to keep up with all the different characters and all the flash backs and different times.  I would recommend this book to my friends.

0345803493|4.0|Let's be honest.  It's not a great piece of literature.  But it does have entertainment value!  I wouldn't read it again, but it wasn't bad.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This thing reads like a 14 year old wrote it.  I had to stop halfway through.  Apparently all the fuss is because there is lots of sex in it but YAWN it is repetitive and gets old fast.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|If I really look forward to reading a book and put off other activities to find out what is happening in its pages, then I've got a really good book. I had a hard time shutting my Kindle down for the day. I want more!!!
0345803507|1.0|This is a truly awful book.  I read the other two in the trilogy and they were entertaining.  This was just boring.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is what most of us have been waiting for, how to actually manifest our intentions.  Pam takes all of what we have previously read and learnt in books such as Think & Grow Rich, the Secret etc and shows up how to put . As Pam says, this is the practical part of the curriculum, we've all got the theory, and here is the guidance on how to put it into practice so that you can realise it for yourself.  The fundamental part of all this is our beliefs which can become a bit flattened after years of trying without results.<br /><br />I've tried a few of the experiments and things have definitely showed up ~ so be clear and careful what you ask for!  As a result a fantastic business opportunity has showed up, and I'm now wondering, wow, is this really for little old me!  Now asking for clear guidance on the best way to proceed - exciting times.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Good character development.  A &#34;sort of&#34; believable, though convoluted, story line.  An emotional roller coaster that keeps the reader engaged in a &#34;what's next drama.&#34;  I've already recommended it to several of my women friends and am anxious to see if they feel the same about the ending.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|After the 3rd person suggested I read this book I gave in and bought it. As with most book to movies...the book is much better! I loved it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Kept me on edge until the very end when I had to end with an &#34;Oh No!&#34;  Certainly did not expect this kind of ending.

B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Dont expect too much. Some parts seemed far fetched, but all in all it was a cool movie and I enjoyed it.
B007SGM084|3.0|Wonderful!!!!! E L James has done a wonderful job placing YOU right there with the characters. Just wish it was More. Thank You E L James for a wonderful read.
B00EKXDVOK|4.0|This is not new material.  Listening to the samples, they sound exactly like her two previous Christmas albums, [[ASIN:B000TV4QXC A Christmas Album]] (1967) and [[ASIN:B00005QCNC Christmas Memories]] (2001).  I wouldn't waste your money on this if you already own these two gems.  But, if you don't, you won't be sorry you purchased this.
B00FPH6PRK|5.0|I found this to be one of the scariest movies to date! I wish more were like this! Can't wait to see it again.
B00013RC66|2.0|I sat through the whole movie only because I like Debra Winger.  The movie was missiing everything.  The plot was slow and unfinished.  There was no excitement or suspense.  This movie had poor acting, a poor plot and terrible ending!  I don't recommend at all unless you can get this movie free!

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King has still got it!!  I have been a fan for many, many years!! This, as all the others, is a page turner. Little Danny is all grown up dealing with the nightmares of his childhood while going after the modern day monsters. The only problem with this one is I read it too fast.
B007SGM084|5.0|Omg wow. Yummy. Excellent. Husband has been very happy after read 1chapter or so at bedtime. Need to make more of these Books
B00BF11UM0|4.0|I got this for a night in with my husband. There was enough story for me and enough action for him. Kinda gritty but well presented. We didn't encounter any problems streaming so a success overall.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The show is fantastic. It brings back memories. Of course you have to understand when you watch it that this is a show from the sixties
B002LANLDK|4.0|I was really surprised at how good this movie was. Wasn't too sure where they could take the story line that it hadn't already gone. It went down a new avenue and left room for more.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Why did I wait so long to begin watching this really great show?  I loved the first season, and am excited about seeing the second season.
034580404X|5.0|I am not a reader but I was told by a friend to ready them, so I purchased all three and I couldn’t put it down so sexy and steamy. Can’t wait for the movies.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|I'm going to make this short and sweet. It Mediocre! It's not the worst movie from M. Night Shamalyan, but it's still not great by any means. The movie tries to be metaphor of when baby birds a releasing the nest, but then it fails on those terms at the end of the movie. It also tries to be a father and son story, but it hen it becomes a survival story. This is how the movie illustrates itself. It's not quite sure what it wants to be and all of the emotional playoffs are weak. The journey was okay, but the end result was not moving at all. C rating!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Very scary in the beginning not so much by the end but a great story nonetheless. Very good end and I am addicted to the series.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Topical cases paired with intriguing personal and political plot lines. I'm hooked! It's nice to find a show that makes me think amidst the less cerebral shows out today.
B00DJZR46G|4.0|Elton John is 66; he's not 25 anymore - none of us ever will be 25 years old again. With that said, this outing should be judged on it's own merits and not put up against albums like GBYBR OR CFATBDC.<br /><br />To be honest, this is a pleasant and enjoyable offering, if not chock full of uptempo numbers. Fans: Buy the Walmart version for the DVD concert, but also the get the Target edition for the excellent bonus tracks (which should have been included on the set to begin with).<br /><br />\\"Oceans Away\\" the lead track, should be Elton's next AC hit, given the fact that veterans day is coming and this is a moving tribute to survivors and the ones left behind in various wars. A gorgeous piano line frames Taupin's touching lyric. This segs into \\"Oscar Wild Gets Out\\" which stalls the proceedings for me; a bit tedious lyrically. (I tend to play the tracks in a different order, which I'll show you later). \\"A Town Called Jubilee\\" picks up the pace a little; lots of piano on all of these cuts, this one features some slide guitar work from Doyle Bramhill III; gospel choir accents. \\"Ballad Of Blind Thom\\" follows and is musically reminiscent of a track called \\"Keep It A Mystery' an outtake from 2004's 'Peachtree Road'album. \\"Dream #1\\" is one of three piano instrumentals, and leads into \\"My Quicksand\\" a downbeat number, somber but memorable. The jewel of this set comes with \\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight\\" moderately upbeat song, with strong lyric and musical hooks and a great Vocal. It's somewhat similar to 'I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues'; would love to hear the Elton John Band do this on stage - They're all sorely missing on this album, especially Nigel Olsson and Davy Johnstone, an intricate part of the Elton John sound.<br /><br />\\"Voyeur\\" which was at one time the title track is mildly engaging,while \\"Home Again\\" is an Elton John classic, with a subtle hook coupled with Taupin's haunting theme, that rings true to almost any listener. Back To Gospel with \\"Take This Dirty Water\\" a real hand clapper. Then \\"Dream 2\\" pushes us into a strange song lyrically \\"The New Fever Waltz\\" that has a good hook and a Beautiful melody. \\"Mexican Vacation\\" finds Elton finally rockin' some here, in albeit Gospel mode once again. \\"Dream #3\\" is a great piece with lots of drama about it, as the album's closer and title cut \\"The Diving Board\\" puts in a jazz lounge somewhere, it's alright, but strange for Elton, who's only touched upon this genera once before with the Great \\"Idol\\" from 'Blue Moves' back in 1976.<br /><br />The 3 Target CD bonus tracks are just as compelling as anything that's actually on the album, including a killer track \\"Fifth Avenue\\" a bit like \\"Burning Buildings\\" from 1984's 'Breaking Hearts' plus lightly country tinged \\"Candle Lit Bedroom\\" and the madman tale \\"Gauguin Goes Hollywood\\".<br /><br />Now for my challenge of an alternate Running Order:<br /><br />1. Oceans Aaway<br />2. Home Again<br />3. Dream 1<br />4. A Town Called Jubilee<br />5. Can't Stay Alone Tonight<br />6. Gauguin Goes Hollywood<br />7. Dream 2<br />8. Ballad Of Blind Thom<br />9. Fifth Avenue<br />10. My Quicksand<br />11. Dream 3<br />12. Take This Dirty Water<br />13. Voyeur<br />14. Candlelit Bedroom<br />15. Mexican Vacation<br />16. New Fever Waltz<br />17. Oscar Wilde Gets Out<br />18. The Diving Board<br /><br />- C. Brian Jasper

B00008G8LG|5.0|I love this movie!! The story, the characters, the setting, and the music are all brilliant.  I would recommend this movie to everyone, although perhaps exercise caution with younger viewers...there are a couple of pretty graphic scenes.  Overall though, I absolutely love it and never get tired of watching it!
B00ET9T2WK|1.0|This has the foundation of  what could be a great game,  but to really progress you have to spend money (and a lot of it). Also, it keeps crashing while it tries to load certain things. I would gladly pay 15-20 dollars for a game like this that didn't try to nickel and dime me; because they put long build times or outrageous resource costs on buildings.
B008220BLG|5.0|Warm Bodies is not your ordinary love story.  Well maybe it is, if you live in a zombie themed world.  Do you?  I sleepwalk but that probably doesn't count.  Anyway Warm Bodies is absolutely hilarious and often times unintentionally hilarious.  I mean come on, a young zombie man falls in love with a non-zombie woman he finds attractive and meets during a zombie strike?  He somehow struggles and fights through his seemingly permanent zombie ways and finds the strength to impress the girl of his liking, and I have to admit, the writing and characterization is good enough to impress me.  For a while it really *does* feel like a typical zombie thriller but with attempts for the young man to fight through and become normal all for the greater purpose of loving a girl.  Strange, isn't it?  Yup!<br /><br />Of course that leads us to the ending... ahem!  Bad ending.  Sorry but it is.  You can't have happiness at the conclusion in a movie like this I'm afraid.  Implementing happiness would mean I'm supposed to take a loving relationship between a zombie and normal lady seriously and I just can't do that I'm afraid!  I suppose you'd have to feel compassion for a zombie in order to believe in any sense of love.  I just take the entire film as tongue in cheek, but the ending makes me think the writers were going for something bigger and more impactful.<br /><br />Anyway I really like how the zombie guy holds the girl \\"hostage\\" and expresses his love in several different ways.  Of course all the girl really wants to do is get out of there and make a clean escape, but that's impossible due to the abundance of zombies everywhere.  Because the movie is so good and truthful to the zombie genre (in the beginning at least) you're still on edge and constantly wondering if the zombie guy will suddenly turn and bite the woman out of nowhere, and thus infect her.  I can't be the *only* one wondering if this would happen, right? I mean technically it's still a zombie movie, right?  Come on, I have to be right!  Let me be right. :)<br /><br />I really enjoyed it.  It's a breathe of fresh air from other zombie movies that always seem to focus on hordes of them infecting victims/invading cities and the regular people have to defend themselves and their friends/family, etc.  This is an original idea here, and I support originality anytime over generic writing!  If my review seems less than enthusiastic, it's because I'm still sort of confused that a zombie and normal human can fall in love.  It's delightfully and entertainingly confusing though!  Highly recommended.
B000003TB6|5.0|a true hip-hop classic from a legendary hip-hop group.  If you're not familiar with the ROOTS material, this is a great place to begin.

B0002O7XVI|5.0|I have loved this movie for years, and it was unavailable to buy for years! I finally found it on Amazon, but it was $45! I rarely pay more than $5 for videos, and never over $10!! When I first looked, it was $44.99! And I thought, well, maybe someday. But Amazon let me know it was available for under $20 including shipping! Didn't wait long to order that!! And it arrived in a timely manner--as always! And in a couple of days, I was sobbing through one of my all-time favorite movies! I would never have paid $45 for it, even though it is one of my all time favorites, simply because I am handicapped and live on a very tiny disability check--I am unable to afford many luxuries. Thank you Amazon-it was Christmas for me when this showed up!
B003U51D58|2.0|This series started out great, but started going down hill and getting too wonky as the seasons progressed.  I stayed lost myself most of the time during Season 6 trying to figure out what was going on with it jumping from one scenario set with everyone on the island to the other scenario with everyone back in the real world and carrying on.  The ending was expected.  Too bad the writers lost their touch towards the end of this otherwise great series.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Watched it twice I enjoyed it so much! There is a lot to take in visually and musically!! A stunning remake so good I read the book ;)<br />Leo is not the only star here, Toby McGuire and the entire cast is GREAT.<br />Take in the beautiful curtain blowing scene and fall in love again with the past....

I heard that prim is going to die .I can't wait until I get my hands on mocking Jay .

B002XUL6RG|5.0|Among the many tag team duos in the cinematic world, Fassbender and McQueen have become, in my eyes, THE one to keep your eyes on. This film is so subtle (in terms of style, not content), yet, so thought-provoking. Absolutely AMAZING! MUST BUY!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I guess I'm a year late or so but the craze has just hit me. I was just surfing around on Wikipedia and ended up on the wiki for the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey movie, and I finally told myself \\"Da*mit I'm going to just read this and see what all the fuss is about.\\" I read this and figuratively fell of my couch laughing. This is easily the most verbose \\"novel\\" of trash I have ever TOUCHED in my life.<br /><br />First off, I should have known just by the name that this book was going to be repetitive. Everyone, for some reason, insists that there are fifty or so shades of grey, when in theory there are an infinite amount of \\"shades of grey.\\" And I know that contemporary novels have a strategy of photographing an innocent object and making it into some big deal in the story.<br /><br />So, first few chapters. Completely typical. A young woman in college or whatever (the book doesn't exactly make the main character's background very clear) with a roommate interviewing someone. How interesting. Let's read further!<br /><br />So basically the story is a trashy \\"plot\\" about a hopelessly naive and typical young woman named Anastasia Steele (really, Anastasia? This is the damn 21st century, James) who somehow gains the attention of the 26 year old BILLIONAIRE who has a \\"haunted background.\\" 26 is fresh out of college; this guy somehow has not only created an immediately successful business (Grey Enterprises, how creative) but also had the time to have 15 former BDSM submissives, become seduced by a mysterious Mrs. Robinson, and yet not have a single instance of legitimate work in the entire story except in the very beginning. As you read further you learn that his mother committed suicide or something, his father who knows, and ended up in a very rich family that thought he was gay.<br /><br />This story was obviously created by a 12-year old girl who accidentally discovered porn on her mommy's computer. This story has absolutely no plot, which I am moderately impressed by considering its thickness, very underdeveloped characters, a cripplingly pathetic attempt at American slang and geography, and a \\"kinky\\" and \\"mysteriously dark\\" sexual feel to it. I think this is a hidden try at making either imprisoned housewives or insane teenagers feel \\"aroused.\\" The author has put absolutely no effort into differing work. How many times has Ana said \\"Oh sh*t\\" or \\"Crap\\" in her thoughts? What the hell even is an inner goddess?<br /><br />Now, the sex. The sex, the sex, the sex. It's not sex, it's a twisted attempt at trying to get a weakly stimulating \\"read\\" into the much more developed and elite genre of erotica. This isn't erotic, it's savage. Christian clearly is a socially stunted man with a laughable low self-esteem who finds his only release from his pathetic life by beating innocent young women. This isn't sexual, it's on the grounds for felony charges. The BDSM is weak, involving contracts and such but really nothing but a veiled form of internet porn that appeals to people who want to rape others.<br /><br />And holy lord, Ana orgasms on every page. Christian glances at her. Orgasm. Christian taps her shoulder. Orgasm. Christian whistles in the elevator. Orgasm. Christian plays the piano. Orgasm. Christian talks about his abusive past and physically assaults her body.<br /><br />Orgasm. According to her claims, Ana apparently lived in a very rural, Puritan society where complete abstinence is a requirement and where masturbation is a sin punished with death. Why wear clothes? You've never even looked \\"down there\\" aside from maybe an STD check or urination, have you?<br /><br />The geography is just pathetic. Apparently Seattle, Vancouver, and what sounds like London are all one city. USE AMERICAN FIGURES OF SPEECH, James! No college white girl doesn't drink Starbucks coffee!<br /><br />Apparently Ana is both anorexic and completely alcohol-free. If you read the second book, you learn that Ana eats nothing over an entire weekend except for a yogurt since she is depressed about leaving Christian. Even insane people who have lost the will to live eat something. And Ana becomes \\"drunk\\" in a matter of seconds.<br /><br />Christian is obviously the result of a couple of sexually-unstable middle schoolers. He is 26, gorgeous, has that dark background all the chicks dig, is athletic, is a pilot for just about any flying machine, is a billionaire, owns at least seven Audi R8s, is a master in a bed, is intelligent, and is capable of seducing a woman just by walking by one. This guy is a fusion of a porn star, Bill Gates (no offense), Brad Pitt, and, I don't know, Eminem.<br /><br />I could spend hours more ranting about how terrible this book is. Read other reviews, because I am sure those have more plot and creativity than E.L. James. I don't know how women feel \\"free\\" when they read this \\"classic\\" but I personally would spank them and have them make me a sandwich.

B009RX7IX8|5.0|Love this show and season five was fabulous!  Love the chemistry between Castle and Beckett and looking forward to the upcoming seasons.
B009KG7EMC|5.0|A fun movie with lots of action and some great cameo roles with 80's and 90's action heros. Would recommend it.
0307476073|2.0|I'm a 27-year old male, and I picked up this book based on a recommendation by Outside Magazine. However, it is much more a book detailing a women's struggle to steer her life onto some semblance of a meaningful path rather than an adventure story. Sure, there were some chapters that I enjoyed, but I ultimately grew tired of Cheryl as the book wore on. She complains a lot and, from my perspective at least, puts the most worthwhile dudes in the friend zone while detailing sex-capades with those who are clearly of lesser quality.  There's also no real conclusion to the story other than the fact that shes makes it to her endpoint on the trail. She didn't convince me that she had really changed or that the trip was anything other than mildly cathartic.<br /><br />So, nothing against the people who love this book, but steer clear if you're looking for something in the outdoor adventure genre. To me, it came across as more of a 'chick-flick' of a story. I wouldn't say that I absolutely regret reading it, but there could have been better uses of my time. I guess it would have helped if I knew this was an Oprah book, but it's also true that I've read other Oprah books previously and enjoyed them thoroughly.<br /><br />Probably going to re-read A Walk in the Woods to flush this one of my mind.

B001E7EONC|5.0|We are told the movie was \\"inspired\\" by real events, and although it's impossible to know what's fiction and what's fact, this movie is one of those cases where reality seems much crazier than fiction. A man stays out of jail thanks to his \\"insurance\\": compromising photos of Prince Margaret, safely tucked away in a bank safe box. Or so he thinks. When a group of robbers break into the bank and steal the photos along with a great deal of money and jewels, everything goes to hell. But who's behind the robbers and why?<br /><br />A tale of power, greed and corruption, The Bank Job is a very entertaining caper, with twists and turns that will keep you glued to the screen. I don't care much for monotone Jason Statham, but Saffron Burrows is totally captivating -- one more reason to watch this flick.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|i thought it was a good continuation to the first book. really enjoy a sweeping epic and when it's several books, even better.  i've read many of ken follet's books now, and i really enjoy his attention to detail and lively characters. i look forward to reading the conclusion of this trilogy.

B00ESF285S|1.0|Was disappointed it would not work on my PC Kindle Intel Core i5. Kindle needs to work on that. Great little book for graduating High Schoolers too.
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|WE'RE THE MILLERS is a laugh-out-loud comedy penned by the same writing team that created WEDDING CRASHERS. Thanks to that inventive comedic writing and a well-blended ensemble of comedians, WE'RE THE MILLERS delivers the funniest movie of 2013 (sorry, [[ASIN:B00FJVBELO This Is The End]], you're a close second).<br /><br />The entire cast carries this film perfectly, hitting every note of comedic timing, both outrageous and subtle. Jason Sudeikis (SNL, HORRIBLE BOSSES) plays the character of drug dealer David Clark. Clark runs out of choices and must make a drug run for \\"boss\\" Brad Gurdlinger, played by Ed Helms (THE HANGOVER). Realizing he can't make this run on his own, he recruits a make-believe family, mothered by Jennifer Aniston's character, Rose O'Reilly. The entire cast deserves recognition, but a special nod is given to Jennifer Aniston for coming back to her FRIENDS-level comedy roots.<br /><br />WE'RE THE MILLERS begins funny and carries the same high (no pun intended) note throughout. What starts as funny, ends as funny--even after the movie. And yes, it is worth viewing the blooper reel; at least you won't have to sit through the credits to view them. Trust me.<br /><br />The only non-comedic parts of the movie are toward the end when the plot needs to start wrapping up. At that point you may start glancing at your watch thinking the movie is a bit long, but then another few more laughs come rolling in and you're back in and immersed with the laughter.<br /><br />Yes, this film is profane and raunchy--and it's hilarious because of it. No, there is no nudity, but Jennifer Aniston has plenty of opportunity to strut her stuff while wearing skimpy material. If you enjoyed WEDDING CRASHERS or any of the other movies mentioned above that the actors have appeared in, then this is a must-see movie. Chances are, you'll laugh your a** off.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Good for your gray matter and eye aerobics.  Fascinating and challenging game, but hard to stop playing it.  Love it.
2245267346|5.0|The coloring and translation are great.  The book was a gift and it served its purpose wonderfully.  I won't comment on the actual content of the book other than it will touch something in your soul that will change forever.
B00EQRP5LW|5.0|Classic John Legend at its best! This is definitely what a music album should sound like and I put it on and just let it play through.  Love in the Future is a must buy!!!
1401225756|5.0|I finally got to reading the great &#34;The Sandman.&#34;  It was completely different from what I had expected.  Half of the time I found Morpheus whiny, annoying, and arrogant.  However, the end is very rewarding...  Oh, and the vendor was fantastic.  Delivered before expected date, flawless.  The recoloring is still visually attractive but now in a way in which things make a little more sense (you can discern things easier).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|AMAZING!!!!! You HAVE TO download this!!!!!!!!! I am SOOOOOOOO happy I got this!!!!!!!!! :D And the best part, it's FREE!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|How do I tell the children who adored Book 1 and Book 2 and the movie, Hunger Games, that they cannot read Book 3. It is terrifying, repulsive and consuming. It has left me with scars that will never go away yet I am so sad that the series is over.
0061124265|5.0|Nice product, I am very pleased to read this book, and have it in my collection<br />I love this author
B008JFUR10|5.0|I have always loved the work of Guillermo Del Torro and enjoyed Pacific Rim very much.  You know an action adventure movie is exciting when the  theatergoers are reacting verbally to the action and cheering for the good guys.<br />I loved the idea of the enemy not coming from outer space but from within our planet, thus necessitating the need for automated mechanoids called Jaegers which are driven by mentally connected  operators.  The monsters that the Jaegers are fighting are called kai jin who have come from a fault near the Pacific rim? and are bent on destroying  humankind.  You will laugh, cry ( Del Toro has always been good at using crying children) and love this film.
143353083X|5.0|besides for the small font, I really like everything about this study bible. The notes at the bottom of almost every page comes in handy and helps me to understand scripture better. I recommend it!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was an interesting book to me since it bounced back and forth between three different women.  They all had issues with their husbands or families of course, but one of the husbands secrets had implications on all three of the women and their families. It makes you wonder if you really know the person you're married to as well as you think you do. I found the locale of Austrailia interesting also.  You don't read much about what life is like in Australia when you live in the United States.  I looked up some of the terminology and car names I ran across to see what it meant or looked like. The Ford Territory apparently is equivalent to the Edge over here. It was a very good read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the most awesomist game in the world the new seasons or months change the theme witch is too cool and I love it
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|Fabulous script, fantastic cast - charming, endearing, funny! Who can resist an angel like Cary Grant?! A holiday must see for the entire family!
B001BANK32|5.0|Reading it again for the first time in 30 years, before reading Doctor Sleep, King still manages to terrorize. Scariest scene: when Wendy stabs Jack on the stairway, and he gets up, saying, &#34;You killed me, you bitch!!&#34;
B009NXD6JM|1.0|I realize this is a classic and most people love it, but I just don't like this film. I didn't stay with it to the end, so maybe it got better. The lead character comes across as selfish and shallow, and she carelessly uses people to perpetuate her irresponsible, partying lifestyle. That's  not my type of person or film.
B00821OX98|5.0|A well thought out concept. The characters are so believable. If you like Sci Fi, you should give this series a look.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was an AMAZINGLY touching & heart wrenching story about love, loss, letting go and learning to live your life to the fullest! I highly recommend, but keep your box of tissues close at hand!
B00DDBB82C|4.0|Great song and great band but it is different from the one I have on tape.<br />I was hoping it was the same one but because you only hear a small part of it I did not know.Still happy I was able to get this one.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Works as advertised, just be sure you have wi-fi turned on so you can see the printer(s) on your networjk.
B00F52YOPA|4.0|I have a new larger Kindle Fire, so hidden object games are easier on the eyes.  I haven't played Home Makeover all the way through, but am enjoying what I have played.  It's well done and a good time passer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series! They have really mastered the art of involving the audience in the lives of the characters! Once I started the season I couldn't stop until I watched every episode!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The intricacies of marriage are told so very well here. What a great book. Had a hard time putting it down.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great gadget to have. But limited apps available. YouTube and Netflix only. Would have been great if it streams most if not all the tablets functions. Can't stream own photos and videos that sucks. Lose connection with TV often. Has to restart all the time.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn has become one of my favorite authors.  She formats her books much the same way in every novel and it lends itself to the suspense and surprises of the story.  And, as a mystery novel buff I couldn't ask for more.....I don't like to be able to figure everything out by the 3rd chapter.  I'm waiting for the next book and hoping it is soon.
0618918248|5.0|My remarks are going to get buried under the thousand plus other reviews, but I'll stick my two cents in, anyway. Dawkins is both an extraordinary thinker and an extraordinary writer. Gloomy he is not, he's joyous, reveling in the beauties of the universe and our planet. He has a twinkle in his eye, a mischievous twinkle which allows him to urge believers in God to re-think their position, or rather, God's position. He writes a satire as if spoken by Bob Newhart that made me laugh so hard the tears were rolling down my face. His immense erudition as well as his familiarity with a vast assortment of literature are very awesome. If you can get through this book and remain a deist, more power to you. I find his atheism stance the only stance for an intelligent person to take, and a wonderful, breezy fresh breath of air unburdened with the great enemies of not only progress but the future of Earth- the three religions Christianity, Judaism and Islam.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|This film is one of the best I've seen for multiple reasons -<br /><br />1. The acting - Both George Clooney and Sandra Bullock do a fine work.<br /><br />2. The music - Fits like a glove and perhaps worth owning by itself.<br /><br />3. The cinematography - Brilliant work that helps set your mind in it from start to finish.<br /><br />4. 3D - Done well.<br /><br />5. Action - Keeps moving at a pace to keep us in it.<br /><br />6. A story - We get it.  Well written.<br /><br />7. I wanted to see it again almost immediately.  This is a sign of a great film.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|the story was not consistent it just seemed to jump around and i never knew if i was in France, USA, or tim buck 2  sorry just could not keep up with where the story line was going from one page to the next.  characters jumped in and out without any where to go.
B00EQF0JJC|1.0|Black and white did not work for me. Taking an old take on a movie and trying to make it to this day and age was not good. Hard to follow.
B001O7JHJ8|5.0|I needed a good &#34;best of&#34; for Erasure, and this compilation did the trick. And since they keep producing great music I will add on another in a few years.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love the interplay of personalities. My favorite character is Louis Litt. He tries hard and succeeds at being a total jerk, but his vulnerable moments that show a caring person underneath redeem him.
B00CFYD682|5.0|She is my number one, so I'm always anticipating a new album from her. This one doesn't disappoint. Well rounded, and great mix of styles, and many &#34;Moyet&#34; touches. With each listen I grow more fond of it, catching a great lyric that I missed the last time. Very pleased, and already anticipating the next release.
142312166X|5.0|My son is almost 7 and since he was 4 we have read the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, along with The Heroes series that followed. As a back to school gift I bought him this book and he has eaten it up with joy! So many fun factoids and little off the beaten path tidbits in this book. It makes the characters so much more &#34;real&#34; to the reader. I've noticed it has also inspired him to start a journal of his own. Anything to help my child to grow his mind is a fabulous this and this has inspired writing, reading, imagination and my bonus, he's reading it himself and gives this single Mama of 2 a short break while he's got his nose buried in the book. Ah.... Worth every penny. :)
B001NLL93W|5.0|These books are an unexpected delight and are lots of fun!  There's action, romance and lots of stuff in between never a dull moment.
B00BMQDM10|1.0|I tried twice to finish it ,but even on a deserted pacific island I still could not muster up the enthusiasm to complete!  Sorry Sophie, I'm usually a big fan but I felt like you needed my holiday more than me!! For want of a more eloquent word..It was BORING!!
B00FN811SY|5.0|this it  is not a application is God Word....and for that is no word----because, It is a saving life method a provision from Jehovah God! ......
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! And I love minions! This is one of the most addicting games yet! I hope there's more levels added soon.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Ive read this before and it is even better the second time. DG does such a good job putting you right there in the story. Ill never tire of reading this series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book will make you laugh. But cry a lot. I have never read a book this moving. It's amazing. I recommend it highly.
B000MVN8GK|5.0|Best show ever<br />I love the fact that she's always searching for the truth<br />An great father daughter dynamic they clicked well
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Cute teen love story. So sweet. Will make you laugh... and cry. Great book. I recommend this book to anyone.
B009AMANBA|2.0|This movie is sad and disappointing. I didn't learn much from it. If you are looking for up lifting don look at this movie
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|Really nice point and click.  Wanted it to last a little longer than it did for the price paid.  Puzzles were challenging but not over the top hard.  Wouldn't mind playing again.  Liked that there was a storyline.  Again, just wish it lasted a bit longer.  Great game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have so much fun playing this game that I end up playing it for hour after hour the whole day!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|The movie had a lot of plot twist.  Was hard to follow at first but the movie came together nicely at the end.  The movie seemed like it moved along too slowly at times.  Not as much action as I thought looking at the reviews.  I am a big Morgan Freeman fan but you were half way through the movie before his 1st appearance.
B0074JODP8|5.0|This is the second time I've bought this album ... the quality of the sound track was much lower.  Others could immediately tell the difference.  I thought about sending it back but I just gave it away.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Kids loved it.  It was mostly about a father daughter relationship with the message of anyone can change. Predictable but quite interesting. Had plenty of action and strange creatures which kept both the kids and family entertained.
B006GLM5EQ|1.0|Horrible stuff! I can't imagine why anybody would find this type of stuff entertaining. In my opinion it should be clearly rated as violence and porn.
B002LAM7PI|4.0|Coraline was well different but enjoyable.  It might be a little bit too dark for some smaller kids.  My kids 6 and 8 found it enjoyable but it is a rather dark movie.  The whole button for eyes might be a little bit too much to take for smaller kids.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|When I first downloaded this game it worked . Now it seems like it has a lot of bugs. It won't connect to Facebook. Now all the progress I've made is lost. It will not reconnect. I have even tried to 're download it. Still won't work. To bad because I loved this game.
B000VI12ZS|4.0|The movie was well done ---- showing the horrors of war and the importance and bravery of the Indians to volunteer to do this job.  I gave the film a four because I don't care for Nicolas Cage -- he seems to be acting, not living, the part.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I have long been a fan of James Altucher's blog - and thoroughly enjoyed his book as well!  Lots of great advice - thank you Mr. Altucher!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome game never had any issues with.  been playing for almost a straight year now cant wait to see what's next
B00FN811SY|5.0|Its so neat and easu to use, the slave really did a great job on this one. proves they really do feed us well. (Spiritually)
B00008MJ8H|5.0|Beautiful beautiful music.  Love the movie, too.  But it must be watched more than once to understand all that is going on.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Loved this movie and the parallels to Wrath of Khan. Afterwards had to watch Wrath of Khan.  So glad these films are on Amazon
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|She rocks awesome cd def worth it and glad they came out with all the songs from her tour instead of part of it
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app for organizizing notes, saving pdfs files. i use it to save pdfs and links to crochet and knit patterns.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I dont do scary movies very well but this wasjust the right amount of scary for me. I cant wait to watch the next season.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Dropbox saved all of my data and pictures when my computer somehow got a bad virus. I was able to clean my hard drive and keep my stuff safe. Thank you drop box!
0767020308|5.0|Special praise is due to this &#34;Emma&#34; for presenting visually what is going on in Emma's lively imagination.  The words of appreciation in the first two reviews are well deserved.  This &#34;Emma&#34; is true to the book.  It does not neglect the solid ethical foundation.  My wife and I have watched it with pleasure half a dozen times, and look forward to the next viewing.  It even has subtitles, which are very important for us old folks.
B00F8802SE|4.0|I am new at this buying it on Amazon. We cut cable and this one of the shows can't get online. I am wanting to know before I buy it what is a TV pass do you get charge weekly or a one time thing. Is it cheaper then not getting it? I would love some customer's feedback before I try to buy it. Is it yours once you buy the episodes for $2.99 or is it renting?
B006OCM0G0|5.0|i love cooking fast food so this is the right game for me. love it because i am always on my kindle.:-)
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|When typing into search box it tries to anticipate what you want from the first letter entered so it doesn't register the rest of what you type.  It is very irritating and a waste of time waiting for it to catch up.
B00915G6SU|5.0|This is a great show can't wait for the next one to start!  Love everyone on the show; each in their own creator.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It is great to be able to see the weather and radar for MY area not just the larger city information.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|This book was awesome! I shared every emotion with Captain Harrington, cried over the loss of friends and crew, and revelled in her victory. I look forward to sharing more adventures with Honor Harrington.
B0058O84G0|1.0|Amazon has a problem: It's understandable that a review of a purchase is wanted but asking for an opinion on a book that I haven't read is a little stupid................
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|It's a great game. It reminds me of subway surfers and the temple run games with a twist. You have to be quick. I haven't quite mastered this game yet.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I enjoy playing this game. So get this game and get your friends to play with you on Facebook. Enjoy it!!
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|My grandson was able to play this game by himself.  I didn't like the fact there was a charge so a child would have to pay
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wow, this series is full of human character.  The stories portray the very nature of people and their goodness along with their weaknesses.  Greed, power, vulnerabilities, generosity, and responsiblilities, are just a few of the traits exposed to their audiences.  The way of life along with everything from wardrobes to housing are authentic.  I love how the show portrays history and historical events.  The story lines keep me interested, so that I find a way to watch the next episode.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|Great premise, practical! Insightful information applicable to many stages of life... Emphasizes positives traits and positions people to thrive in life
B001HNE3NO|3.0|It started great, then just slowed down a ton... It was an okay read, just not my taste. Maybe I was expecting more from the book. As it was interesting, it was most likely not my cup of tea
B001CDZZI6|2.0|Disappointed in this book.  Trust the lower rating reviews.<br />Maybe if you pay for the additional Strengths assessment you'll learn how to apply your 'strengths' and the principles in this book. I'm skeptical though.  The book is vague, and comes across as a nothing more than a sales pitch to buy their products.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|Really love the quality of the g ame, but paying for health potions? Too nickel &amp; dime frustrating. Will play it a little while more until I 'must' make purchases to move forward.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Let's face it I'm addicted to staying connected and sharing pics with my family and friends. We don't always get together anymore but this way we can still share and chat daily.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Awesome game. I really like this game. Great all around fun. Decent aim. All types of game and so far too easy to take down. Good stuff.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|I bought this for my husband who's kind of obsessed with body builders. :) he loved it! I would recommend this  to anyone.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really liked Fifty Shades but these were so much better! I can't wait until the next one comes out!
B008JFUN6E|5.0|I think it's a really great movie, or more specifically a great piece of dramatic provocative cinema.<br /><br />2 hidden messages i saw.  Or at least as movies go, this sort of thing really emanates that hidden-message vibe, and in a movie like this, one would expect a vast number of hidden messages.<br /><br />1. On the bottom of Kruger's aircraft (which is shaped like the freemason eagle on the back of the dollar bill, a digital camo version rather :) is a number scaling the bottom: 030211.  There could've been written anything on the bottom of the plane, and certainly not in numbers in massive size.  In the movie it's obviously the number of the aircraft, but I was thinking it seemed a little specific.  ??? People please help be investigate this number :-) the burden can't be entirely upon me to figure it out, so please assist me.  What happened on march 2, 2011 that neil wanted us to look at?  I think it was a few days before fukushima, which was on the 11th i think.<br /><br />The other hidden message that stood out was the gun that matt damon used called the \\"chem rail\\".  Again, super oversized letters written on a weapon, and weapons Never have huge names written on them.  Certainly at that point in the movie, the title of the gun did nothing to support anything else that was going on dramatically, well it did just enough to make you think it fit in, but still felt contrived.  So in a movie Like This, out of any movie, wouldn't the director who is clearly hip to darker forces in the world, controversial subjects and conspiracies... well, what do you folks hip to conspiracies think of when you see the big letters \\"Chem Rail\\"?  I think the movie would've be overwhelmed with subplots if neil had put in chem trails to the story, but i think he wanted us to notice them as a very important issue, because all the other hidden messages of the movie are woven in deeply, not all surface-level and contrived like the cheesy gun called the chem rail.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Ok, the story of the movie, which i wasn't entirely certain of, makes sense to me now.  There are only a few hollywoody moments that were unrealistic, and seemed done just for the sake of haste, moving the story along.  And on that note, this was a much more thorough story before Blomkamp finished the film.  This movie more than any movie I've ever seen is completely streamlined, they did a second draft on the script where they just hacked up the first one to create a very fast moving story.  They sped it up so much that it takes like 2-3 close watches to pick up everything, well, at least for me :-P.  I absolutely love the film and it is a hard-charged masterpiece, a very good dramatic action future movie.
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|Thank goodness they got rid of the Leviathan storyline; I thought season 7 was one of the weaker seasons, and season 8 ramped it back up to quality (could it have been Sara Gamble's fault? Maybe, since she's no longer a show-runner).
B00FPH6M82|2.0|The trailer makes this look like an exciting survival movie on an \\"alien\\" planet but all of the exciting parts are already given up in the trailer so there is nothing left for the rest of the movie.<br />The special effects are pretty seamless but the acting is not great and you end up not caring very much.<br />It is all a little predictable too, and the voice-over at the beginning is like a mock voice-over...
B001ECQ4AS|5.0|I've watched this show since it's beginning, and I think it's only gotten better. Seeing the first season again after so many years was incredibly entertaining, and shows how much the cast and crew have grown.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have played Minecraft on the computer and if was fun! I would say that Minecraft  P.E.is a great game for handheld devises.
1595825045|5.0|This book is a must-have for any Avatar fan (especially those fond of free-drawing because of the sheer volume of quality pictures to try to duplicate with your own artistic talent.  The inside-look that the book provides is interesting as well.
B004JMY312|5.0|I Love this movie, I have watched it every year for the last 20 years!! It's a Halloween must see.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I was looking for a book to read during our vacation and this one caught my eye.  Boy am I glad!  I finished it in two days and probably would have completed it sooner had it not been for the activities planned on vacation.  I kept thinking about this book and the characters whenever I was away from it.<br /><br />I fell in love with the characters and was so drawn to the story line that I couldn't wait to find out how it ended.
0670024856|3.0|Loved the first part, the exposition.  Really liked the way she wrote the early chapters.  Bogged down in the middle.  Skipped to the finale & her earth shaking revelation which I felt was less believable, too contrived,
B0081336FO|5.0|Benedict Cumberpatch and Martin Freeman are a match made in heaven in this adaptation of Sherlock Holmes witty, clever, snickering fun!
1451648545|5.0|I expected to plow my way thru part of the book & leave the rest unread because I'm 86 years old & not into, &#34;tech.&#34;  But I couldn't put it down & found myself reading every word.  Finished it in 4 days.  It was the best biography I've read since my last David McCullough.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good non-fiction read.
B00DWFQ2N4|3.0|I'm a big fan of Justin but this album didn't really do it for me. The First experience CD is  definitely better than this one, he should have just made one album instead of two. I find myself skipping a lot when I listen to it which is unusual for a JT album. Anyway, standout tracks include Cabaret, TKO, murder and drink you away. I wouldn't recommend buying the album, maybe borrow a friend's lol.
B004ZNAXX2|5.0|This is a great set for any Pink Floyd fan. It has everything even some never released items, all in a box set!
B007BFSYMS|2.0|Maybe this app wasn't for me, but I didn't care for it.  I actually ended up deleting this app.  I didn't use it.
B000002KGT|5.0|A must for any Fleetwood Mac fan.  This is one of their best albums!  I remember listening to the vinyl many years ago. The CD has great sound too.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use this app just about every day.  I love Ebay and this app is great.  I would tell anyone that uses Ebay that they need this app.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I must admit, I am really glad that I have Amazon Prime so that I can watch Suits (It's not on Netflix). It's fun, gripping, and an all-around good time!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I would recommend this app.  It can be nice to look up the phases of the moon, past present and future.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is science fiction with a realistic twist. It may not be the absolute best book I have read but nothing in it is terrible and it has few things are great. The big thing I found amazing was the plot. There are lots of surprises and peeks at the \\"omniscient\\" point of view that doesn't make sense until later.  I also found some of the characters pretty enjoyable although others may need some work.  That being said it's a pretty good book.<br /><br />One thing that a good book must have is a good idea in the first place. The idea should be unique and serves as a good foundation for the whole story. If you look at bestseller young adult novels you'll see that their basis is different. Ender's Game differs in many young adult novels in the way it uses children and it is not as focused on adventure style action focusing on pilots of spaceships, which you get in a lot of sci-fi.  The action is more tactical, which is unique<br /><br />I did have a problem with the Valentine and Peter subplot back on Earth.  It is somewhat confusing if readers don't know what the nets are. I liked how Peter's jealousy and desire for power fuel this subplot although it isn't nearly as good as the main plot. Since it was not as exciting, the pacing in these areas of the book slowed down from the built up excitement when you are following Ender. Although this story point felt necessary it wasn't as enjoyable.<br /><br />I would recommend this book if you like either sci-fi or adventure fiction such as Artemis Fowl. Somehow this book was really pretty fast paced for me though there isn't the standard types of action you find in young adult books. This book is a must read for young adults.

1909313033|5.0|If you have ever lived with a pug, you will be charmed by Gemma Correll's estude observations of pug ettiquette ( read, &#34; pug character&#34; ). In both words and whimsical illustrations she nails the pug attitude toward life and the world in general. It brought a smile to my face and evoked a few chuckles as I saw my own pug, who I thought was so unique, captured perfectly on her pages. This book will warm the heart of any lover of this peculiar but endearing breed of dog. Go fetch!
B004Y042N8|1.0|Not quite sure what the point of this app was.  It was really boring and seemed really pointless.  Don't waste your time
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|It's like a darker version of Scandal, the Democratic version of politics at its murkiest; absolutely fascinating. Looking forward to Season 2, and Season 3.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A wonderful way to learn more about yourself and your partner. It is important to know your loved one's love language in order to be filling their love tank.  A must read for couples; especially couples who may be suffering from a strained relationship.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|A good movie. I enjoy a comic book hero on film. The good guys are good, the bad guys are bad. Bravo!

B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This game is lots of fun. At first it's easy but gets harder as it goes. Love playing as the dog.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Ok, so this is a heist novel. The characters just happen to live in an alternate reality with magic. The characters are well balanced, the dialogue is witty, and a few times I laughed out loud. For sure recommend to fantasy readers, and likely anyone looking for an adventure.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great money's worth. Amazon player is a great program and it offers many features like HD and you can start off from where you left off.
B00F56AZK4|3.0|It was all right.once you got used to using the format that there were no interlocking pieces to choose from.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I did not expect such a twist  ending !!  I can't wait to start book 3 to see what happens next.
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|This release doesn't let up from the second it starts, it's a brutal fast paced ride with a great story behind it, the title track deceiver of the gods portrays how loke was always treated horribly because was not born of Asgard and how he will rule the throne one day by overthrowing the gods. It really shows how the rest of album goes from there on, in my opinion this is one of the best albums Amon has put out, my highlights off of this album are the title track, shape shifter, as loke falls, blood eagle, coming of the tides, and warriors of the north, especially warriors of the north it's in my opinion the best track on the album, and as a bonus the ep under the influence is really cool. I highly recommend this album to anyone enjoys Amon Amarth.
B007SGM084|5.0|I got all three e-books at once. I read all three in about three days. Can't wait for the movie!!

B001W2JWWC|4.0|Only one or two songs failed to get significant radio play and it has several of their greatest hits on it.
B005LAIIGM|5.0|Gravity is a film where seeing it in 3D is not mere gimmick. The opening sequence is a fabulous experience in itself where the viewer is brought into the experience of the astronauts working outside the space shuttle. The initial view of Earth is not only breathtaking but one has the feeling of weightlessness as George Clooney, using his jet pack, does a space walk.  Gravity's director Alfonso Cuarón wrote the script with his son, Jonás and came up with a simple story of survival that rivals Apollo 13 for sheer excitement with many moments fright. Ironically, Ed Harris is the voice of Mission Control. After the initial 13 minutes, where repairs are being done to the Hubble Space Telescope, there is no letup in the edge-of-your-seat drama.<br /><br />Although this is a movie dominated by special effects, it is the performances of the actors that are truly memorable. George Clooney was an excellent choice to play Matt Kowalski, the mission commander. He brings an authority to the role as if he had flown a dozen space shuttle missions. Sandra Bullock is likewise excellent as first-time astronaut Ryan Stone. She is the focus of the film and turns in a superb performance as she desperately tries to find the lifeboat that will take her back to earth. There are some improbable moments in the film where Ryan manages to push the right button but it is the performance by Ms. Bullock that takes hold of the audience and makes us care.  Even in their cumbersome flight suits, Clooney and Bullock connect with their audience.<br /><br />Gravity is one of those rare films that will have you thinking and talking about the experience long after you have left the theater. The stunning cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and film music by Steve Sanger with the great performances ensure this will be a film to see again.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|Borrrrrrrrring!  Do not buy it nor rent it.  Disappointing, considering that it is a Will Smith movie.  May be he needs to stick to acting rather than producing.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Been waiting to see it.  Thought we were getting the series to start at the beginning but nope.  We'll definitely go back and catch up..
B0063IH60K|2.0|Every single hand starts with an advertisement.  Sometimes they are videos, so they are loud.  That really doesn't work when I'm on a mobile device.
B0043JDUNS|2.0|Premise was a little off track.  If you watched Iron Man, quickly followed by Iron Man 2, you'd be like; WTF?  What just happened?  Is this the same guy?<br /><br />Effects are good.  Otherwise: meh.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|A very good read, maybe easier then the iconic Orwell about today's sometimes alarming developments and loss of privacy. Written in the form of a novel, this should be required reading for anyone who is not aware of the trail they leave online and what the future implications could be. Privacy or transparency will be one of the biggest debates of the coming years.
B007V4LBLU|4.0|I wish I could have understood more of the dialogue.  That's on me though.  I thought it was a really fun watch.  The poop part was kinda gross, even for me.  I loved it.
B00CHF2Q4Y|5.0|TOMORROW NEVER DIES is the best of the Bonds. Roger Spottiswoode did a bang-up job as director handling the action sequences and delivering the script's more timely and coherent storyline to the screen. Pierce Brosnan gets down to business and returns to more familiar territory and storytelling in TOMORROW NEVER DIES. This is the only Brosnan-Bond film where the team of M, Moneypenny, Charles Robinson and Q work as a very efficient and cohesive unit. When of the best things to come along in years was composer David Arnold who scored this film. He continued the sound created by John Barry and simultaneously brought the action to a more modern film-making experience. TOMORROW NEVER DIES is one of the best Bond films of the series. The Blu-ray is amazing!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Very different view of invention. Everyone is some kind of constructive thieves. It is about connecting things differently for completely different original product.
B00BMTX5IW|5.0|I discovered Caro Emerald recently when I was visiting friends in England.  Her music is very different, almost European Cabaret from many years ago.  It's wonderful, and will have you tapping your feet.  I'm amazed she isn't really known here.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|Beautiful songs, wonderful melodies, and so Alice in Chains. I love this album. No disrespect to Layne Stanley, but William DuVall rocks, he seems like he has always been a member of AIC.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I have a little cousin that wants to do everything that I do and I put him on this game and well play for hours and so well I and my other cousins
B00C061I1M|4.0|This is an obviously talented lady who is finding her voice on a new recording. The voice is distinctive and the tone is one that takes the ear a moment to adjust. But it is well worth the adjustment. Her writing and delivery is excellent. I found myself hooked on the second listen. The lyrics are not the trite stuff that tries to jar one into listening just because it is different, but I sensed a personal connection to the songs from Ms. June and her writing team. My only quibble is that her voice sometimes gets lost in the musical gumbo of an otherwise excellent production. The clarity of her unique sound and delivery is opaque in some of the songs. There was foresight enough to include a sheet with lyrics. A mighty effort by a unique artist.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|Not nessecarily my favorite. My kids did enjoy it and watched it a couple of times!  Then they ran off to play pretend Croods!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put either the first or second book down until the end.Intense books that<br />keep you reading.Everyone has read this Trilogy and I wanted to know what they were talking about.<br />Mrs James has given the wine industry a boost and the music industry too. Christian and Anis celebrative champagne is sold out. The winery has created a blend of their 1999 vintage for all of us who want to take it to parties and find<br />out what they were drinking.<br />I also love the classical music in the Trilogy and after listening to you tube videos of the playlist,I may buy some<br />of the beautiful pieces.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book ruined me. For days i couldn't even open another book!!! One review said it wasnt believable because normal teenagers aren't that developed. Well, normal teenagers aren't battling cancer knowing they will lose. I loved everything about this book. Highly highly recommend.
B00DMEQP46|5.0|The first official studio album release by MGMT, Oracular Spectacular, was a mix of songs fit for the radio play they inevitably received, as well as several that leaned into the void of lyrics and music that require multiple listens to develop an ever-expanding, ever-changing view on the overall message of a given song.  4th Dimensional Transition and the closing track, Future Reflections are two examples of the direction MGMT was to take in the future.  Metanoia was the 10+ minute long single before Congratulations came out that cemented the new direction of the band.  Despite this, Congratulations was met, particularly in the US, as so much of a departure from the pop elements of the hit singles, Kids and Time to Pretend, that many felt it was an attempt to alienate fans.  However, the band itself and I agree that any real fan understood that not only were both of those singles written years before the less pop-oriented music of much of the rest of the album, but that MGMT led us toward the direction of Congratulations long before releasing it.  Not only that, but Congratulations ISN'T straying from &#34;pop&#34; or &#34;fun&#34; sounding music, so much as it is turning down the repetition, hooks, and childishness of songs that they had matured from writing over the years.  However, it seems the band did learn some sort of lesson from Congratulations in that this third album was not only well discussed as being a sort of &#34;everlasting gobstopper&#34; as the band described Congratulations to be, but that this self titled third album was a newfound mixture of MGMT-esque psychedelics and elements more friendly to the pop-oriented crowd without sounding like their old work.  It's a strong mix of almost everything I want MGMT to be, satisfying me and, hopefully, satisfying critics and fans alike enough to cement the band as one with a long road of music ahead of them.  The third album is always judged as the one which determines if a band has a future or not, and MGMT have shown, especially with personal favorites like Alien Days, Mystery Disease, Introspection (the Faine Jade cover), and Plenty of Girls in the Sea... that there is the potential for several more everlasting gobstopper albums in the coming years, enough layers of music to dive into to truly be everlasting... or at least, for me, until I'm done on this earth!  Buy it!  PS: The Optimizer! ;-D

B004TSXUWY|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot and looked forward to picking it up each night for a read before bed. It explored a topic - amnesia - I hadn't considered much before and prompted me to think about how I, or my husband, would deal with the situation. I found the ending a little predictable but it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.  Would definitely recommend it.
B003O86FMW|3.0|As indicated in the heading above this is just more of the same from the first book which is fine as I liked the first book.

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Here's my review for the album Self Portrait....<br /><br />\\"What is this s@#t?\\" I'll tell you, Rolling Stone Magazine. This s*@t is the epoch of Dylan's great run of 1960s albums. The thing is, hippies and the critics at the time hated this album. And why? Because Dylan wasn't being overtly existential or singing songs that were socially relevant. Heck, many of them were covers! How dare he!? How dare he not be fashionable!? Paul McCartney's wonderful RAM album suffered a similar condemnation. Apparently, the squarest thing you could do at the break of the 1970s was just make well constructed, exceedingly pleasant music to listen to. I mean, why LISTEN to music when you can sit around, passing a joint, and decipher it with your college boy friends? The fact that an album as good-natured, human and sublime as SELF PORTRAIT couldn't bring a smile to these hippies and critics proves there was something missing in them...and NOT in Dylan. This IS a self portrait of the artist at the time: Showing all his different sides and moods. There are lush orchestrated experiments in minimalism (\\"All The Tired Horses\\", \\"Wigwam\\"), NASHVILLE SKYLINE style country tunes (\\"I Forget More Than You'll Ever Know\\", \\"Take Me As I Am\\"), campfire folk songs (\\"Alberta\\"), hillbilly knee-slappers (\\"Little Sadie\\"), boogie-woogie jams (\\"Woogie Boogie\\"), sweet soulful ballads (\\"Let It Be Me\\", \\"Belle Isle\\"), gospel strutting R&B (\\"Gotta Travel On\\"), and live cuts that aren't \\"lifeless\\" by any means (\\"The Mighty Quinn (Quinn The Eskimo)\\"). In short, it's a musical landscape in the shape of America. This was Dylan just being a musician in the purest sense. But I guess all his so-called fans and the music press didn't really like the SOUND of Dylan or his music. They simply liked the IDEA of his music. When they were left to hear Dylan croon \\"Blue Moon\\" they couldn't process that. It didn't compute. Why would Dylan just sing a nice little song he liked? Because he was a SINGER and he liked the song. And by this point, Dylan was a very expressive vocalist. They didn't call them covers when Sinatra or Elvis did them. Bob Dylan was an entertainer. This was what he was saying with SELF PORTRAIT. He was a song & dance man. A traveling hobo with a guitar and a tall tale. A man that looked up at the big blue sky and took a breath of air. A balladeer, a vanguard, a clown...a brilliant genius child. It's as Dylan as Dylan gets. I'll take \\"Wigwam\\" over any dated protest song any day of the week. Because what you get with \\"Wigwam\\" and the other songs on SELF PORTRAIT is the pure joy of music.<br /><br />And here's my review for the deluxe Another Self Portrait box-set...<br /><br />It's worth every penny. The remastering on Self Portrait is great and the two discs of out-takes and alternate tracks is impressive. The complete 1969 Isle of Wight is also an awesome addition: It's Dylan in his rare countrified Nashville Skyline period, kicking out the jams with The Band. Amazing concert. You'll never hear Dylan sound like this...not before or after. He's crooning in his \\"country voice\\" and it's a great set-list. The live version of \\"I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine \\" could be the most moving performance I ever heard from Dylan and it's even better than the studio version of the song.  Overall, this box set is a treasure for people who want to hear a pop music genius in his prime and when he didn't care about pleasing fans or critics...he just wanted to have a good time making music.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|I missed it when it was on tv and now wow great show.can't wait to see the rest<br />Now to watch the next session
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is one collection of shows that only improve with re-watching.  Firefly reflected the work of a special group of very talented people and there are many aspects of the shows that are unique.  One of my favorites.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|I love sci-fi. I'm big into Dr Who, and I grew up on Star Trek and various sci-fi movies. Although Galactic Energies is true science fiction, it takes everything to a new level. The Perfect Family and Life in Prison are simply amazing! I got sucked in to reading them instantly. The storylines are most compelling and suspenseful. They make you feel and care. The endings were great surprises. These short stories are very well written with complex characters. I would definitively recommend them to a friend.

B0095VPBFY|4.0|I am using this for an XBMC build running Windows 8. My biggest concern for an HTPC was to make sure it would handle 1080p without issue. It has no problems with video playback over wired networking. Personally, I don't think any HD video should be streamed over wifi or you are just asking to have issues with playback. Make sure to match this up with fast RAM since it shares for the video processing.

Walmart being the worst. That being said Mad Catz was a super wonderful place to work...Saying that to say this steering wheel is and continues to be a quality product. Never thought I would be so satisfied, truth be known, its a really great steering wheel. im very happy with my purchase and recommend it to anyone who likes racing games.

B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|Bastille knocks it out of the park with this amazing album.  Pompeii was prereleased on the EP (Haunt) catching everyone's attention. The entire album follows suit. Each track has it's own unique story, from Flaws to Icarus, everyone can find a story they can relate to. Not only would I highly recommend this album if you loved Pompeii, but I can almost promise that you will not be disappointed.

B0035Q4AFC|4.0|I liked this movie went if first came out and once again it was a joy watching it with my 20-year-old son, who is a fan of Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes and Ironman.  Downey is a decent actor that does well bringing comedy to the screen as well able to show his ability to be serious dramatic actor in the same work.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|I have no idea why you should read this as related to the Maze Runner series, or at all.  I thought perhaps it would explain why the 'maze' was created, but it didn't.  I couldn't see that it explained anything.  In what way is this a prequel?  (This is not a rhetorical question...I would really like to know.) Perhaps this should be read after reading more of the series?<br /><br />The book opens on a small group of survivors who have made it through the sun flares that have killed off most of the population. I was really interested in the pre-story to this part of the book as it sounded fascinating, but don't get your hopes up.  Hardly any of this is explained.<br /><br />Now, the few survivors have a new enemy--a virus that turns people into zombie-type creatures.  Sellout!  It felt like the author was buying into the present day zombie hype rather than coming up with a creative idea.<br /><br />Mark and Trina survived the flares and made a home in the wilderness with a bunch of other misfits.  When the zombie plague invades their small group, they find themselves on the run once again.  Mark discovers evidence of other groups in the wilderness, one decimated by the virus and the other with confusing, cutting-edge technology.  When Mark and his group see (and are almost killed by) some type of flying ship; they know its makers hold the key to survival on this new earth.<br /><br />I found this story to be very bland.  It was just a straight narrative of a very confusing and diluted chain of events with characters I could care less about.  Just so-so.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Riveting and captivating. I have loved this series since the pilot. The acting and writing is still as fresh and believe able as season 1.
B0000DK4PO|1.0|When my order came in I could tell right away it was not new. It was put in a generic clear case and then shrink wrapped. Since I paid only a few dollars for it I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. I opened it and the DVD did not appear to have any scratches. When I tried to play it I received an error message. &#34;This disc cannot be played in this regional area.&#34; What a waste of time and money.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|I had to read this book for summer reading, and it turned out not to be so bad. It was fairly short wich would be good for most people out there. Also, it had a moving plot line with constant ideas so it wasn't terribly dry or boring. For a book out of fun i would say sure if you have no other ideas, but as summer reading you don't have to start complaining about it yet.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book is not quite like any book I have ever read. The very idea of meeting someone through the \\"lonely hearts\\" section of a newspaper was interesting, but I would have NEVER guessed how this was to turn out. I felt very strongly for the misremembered man, and was on the edge of my seat at times with how I thought his story would turn out. The parts about his past at the orphanage were hard to read, but necessary in the overall plot, and I appreciated how they were written. You got the gist without having to hear the details. I actually recommended this to my mom, who is also and avid reader but don't often find books we both like. It's hard to say you enjoy a book like this because it was dark at times, but the overall plot, and especially ending really stuck with me. The message is of hope and never knowing what tomorrow will bring. I really liked it.

B000FCKC4C|1.0|What a long-winded way to say what can be said in three minutes! Here's what the entirety of the book in one paragraph (yeah, if you've heard it all before, well de ja vu, be thankful that I saved you the trouble and expense) ...<br /><br />1. Follow your dreams. 2. If you don't follow your dreams, one day, you wouldn't be in position to do so. 3. They will be naysayers who'll try to discourage you, ignore them. 4. You'll encounter defeats along the way, for sure. 5. Don't be discouraged 6. Live in the present, not the pass nor for the future. 7. Don't give up, because you never know, the next stone you turn over may be the gold nugget. 8. Women -- their whole purpose in life is to wait for men (like you) to fulfill their lives, so don't EVER let them impede you.<br /><br />If you think I made any of the above up, including that last one up, then go ahead, spend the money ... see for yourself if indeed gold is present in 'em lead, LOL!

B008JFUPOY|3.0|Capitalizing on the rightly deserved praise and success of the first film, Pixar decided to make a prequel showing how Mike and Sully came to be the dynamic duo of the monster world's energy concern. The movie shows them meeting (and clashing) in Monster University's screamer program. They are polar opposites, with the completely unfrightening Mike showing an uber-nerd's dedication to tests and book-learning while Sully relies on his size and family name to coast by, without realizing that they are things he has to live up to. Will they ever learn to respect and appreciate each other? Will they get kicked out of MU?<br /><br />The problem with prequels is that we already know how it ends: with the two of them working as the monster world's most successful screamer duo. That means that a movie like this has to find its tension and suspense in the connective tissue. It's never a \\"will they? won't they?\\" type of thing, but more of a \\"how will they?\\" This is accomplished by setting up a lot more plot turns than you'd expect to find in an animated (children's?) film. In fact, the plot takes so many turns that the real point of the film -- to show us how Sully and Mike reach success -- is accomplished by a still frame montage at the end (the fourth or fifth montage of the movie, if my memory is correct). Meanwhile, because this is a Pixar film, there are a lot of sight gags, amazingly rendered scenery, goofy strings of dialogue, quasi-cute monster designs, and inside jokes to the first film (as well as a lot of monster-related puns).<br /><br />It's not a bad film. It's fun, takes an interesting approach to its final moral, and has some cute moments. However, it also feels derivative (say hello to yet another movie about a preppy, jock-ish fraternity in contest against the underdog fraternity), and because the story gets redirected about four or five times, it also feels overlong and needlessly complicated. If you think too long or hard about any real part of the film, flaws reveal themselves pretty readily. They're not huge or gaping, but they're there. Even that's acceptable and would still result in a four-star review except that the first film was so perfectly done that this one feels like a very pale imitation of its predecessor. A visual treat and not without its charms, it still fails to fully satisfy.aws reveal themselves pretty readily. They're not huge or gaping, but they're there.

1416549447|5.0|Read this book and applied techniques prior to ChiRunning Workshop I attended. It allowed me to understand and apply the techniques at the workshop & to see what I was doing correctly and what I need to practice on. It would have been over-whelming had I not attended the workshop in addition to reading the book. I also purchased the DVD at the workshop to complement the learning process. It is a whole new concept of running which takes practice and patience. I'm an older runner, almost 55, who's been out of the game for a while. Into it about 2 months now, no injuries, no knee pain, just initial soreness in the right areas for using correct technique. Highly recommend the ChiRunning/Chiwalking approach & supportive materials.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a wonderfully acted series, with very appealing stories.  The main actors are wonderful, as are the supporting actors.  It is lovely to find a story that appeals to adults and children as well.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I use this holster all the time at the shop! This compliments my Inova X series flashlight! I can work on cars, crawl under trucks, climb big trailers and do whatever needed to get done, and this holster does the trick every time!! It is very sturdy and well made. Made in USA I must add. You can position the flashlight at whatever direction you wanted; it goes 360 degrees and the flashlight won't go anywhere! If you're looking for a holster, this is it, the best bang for the buck!<br /><br />Update February 3, 2014:<br />Unfortunately, the front stitches that holds the front cloth on my holster is starting to fall apart. It flaps around whenever I move. Note that this is absolutely not a deal breaker, just something that has made the holster a little difficult and uncomfortable to use. Other than this issue, the main stitches that holds everything together remains intact, and the holster is still completely usable. It still goes 360 degrees and holds my flashlight just as perfect as the first time I used it. Perhaps, the one I got was just defective. Now, what's good about this update is that the manufacturer proved they stand behind their product. After I emailed them last weekend, they responded and offered to give me another one!! This made me very, very happy! And I am absolutely satisfied with my purchase! Don't even think twice, grab this holster! Just in case you wonder, I own an Innova XO3.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|As always, movies with comic book heros are full of irrational ideas and far-fetched scenes and this one is no different.  If you forget about all of that this movie is quite enjoyable.  I thought it fun to involve so many great characters.

0061950726|4.0|Yes, this book intertwines the stories of 2 people in a small town in Maine:  91-year-old Vivian & 17-year-old Molly. But the majority of the pages are devoted to the story of the first 24 years of Vivian's life.  We see her come with her family in search of a better life in America.  After the deaths of her parents & siblings, she finds herself on an orphan train headed for the Midwest.  Her family had fled bad conditions in Ireland, & their life in a New York apartment had been no bed of roses.  But now that 9-year old Niamh (aka Vivian) is alone, she encounters new struggles to find food, clothing, & shelter for herself.    She met each new difficulty with the resilience of a child & with a grace beyond her years.  Her struggles were heartwrenching; & whenever someone offered her the smallest kindness, I wanted to stand up & cheer.    Engrossing story, memorable characters.  I look forward to reading more by this author.

B009AMALLM|2.0|Love watching haunted movies and I did enjoy the first 3 sequels. Unfortunately for this I was not thrilled about it.  Im not a fan of movies that go beyond the scale of realism such as this film portrays. For example, showing the woman who had vanished in sequel 3 and now she appears as a spook and the ending was terrible.<br /><br />The problem with todays haunted films and they do not mix realism with it. Many films are based only on special affects.  for example, the exorcist is a great demon type of film where the evil spirit does not show up and disappear out of no where and Amityville horror ( original film) again you never see the spirit, you only get a small glimpse of it.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It held my attention and Mr. King wasn't as wordy as he usually is, therefore the book flowed for me.  Unlike other reviews I read, I was glad he didn't get too deep into what happened to Wendy and Danny immediately after the Overlook hotel experience.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This book reminded me of how lucky we are to have survived the threat of intentional or accidental annihilation. The author has done his homework and accurately recounted a history supported by other works, plus revealing the appalling disregard for safe weapon designs that lasted for over 30 years. Especially enjoyed  the telling of the tale of the airmen and officers who were involved in the Damascus incident. These unfortunate people had to deal with a nightmare scenario.

Could it really happen here, in this country...on our own soil ?  Hopefully not BUT......<br />In Claire Danes, the manic personality takes on an admirable quality as she strives to save the country but drives everyone around her totally nuts. (she must go back to real life totally exhausted). Damien Lewis is masterful in manipulating our feelings (and Claire's).Do we feel sorry for him or truly hate him? Do we understand his viewpoint or consider him the worst of traitors?<br />The supporting cast is excellent. We will be missing a few of the truly bad guys in government in Season 3.....I can't wait to see what happens.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Dont get me wrong. This is probably one of the best tech for folks who want to view internet content on TV.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, the dongle wont work with my Vizio TV. I replaced the dongle once assuming that i got a defective piece (thanks to Amazon while Google support dragged the case for-ever) but still the same issues.<br /><br />It just wont work with my Visio. (Its an LED tv). The video starts flickering and then breaks every 5 seconds, giving me a blue screen. To me its a waste of investment until i buy the next TV. Now you tell me, is it worth to buy a new TV just to make $38 chromecast work? Why not i just buy a smart tv rather? I dont know..<br /><br />There is no warning from google that the dongle will work on on a certain kinds of TV (afaik) and i feel cheated :(<br />Please take a look at some of the comments before buying the dongle.<br />[...]<br /><br />I am still trying to figure out a way to get this thing work. Hope i will stumble onto something.
B00C9G22R2|5.0|Beloved and lovely Northern Chinese - if you want to see why the Southerners light up with their visits, see this movie.  All of their integrity and moral NOBILITY is on display here in the performances of Zhang Ziyi and the rest of the Mainland actors here.  I have the original cut but I WISH there was a Director's Cut with all the missing scenes tantalizingly reported in the Chinese press.  The Southern Barbarians LOVE the Northern Han.<br /><br />In my double disc version, the features offer a computer graphic of the map of China with the names of the different participating regions appearing in brush strokes and as they appear, I realized that this is the hint of the united front of all the provinces, all the clans, all the socalled \\"ethnicities\\" of the Chinese united against the Japanese invasion.<br /><br />The story looks like the moving of Chinese kungfu ever Southward until it reaches the haven of British-controlled Hong Kong.  It doesn't make any sense/profit that they are all on the same street in Hong Kong if you don't wonder if these are all Japanese guerrilla fighters.<br /><br />The wife of Ip Man is played by a famous South Korean actress the casting of which despite her lack of lines indicates the Chinese position on Korean women in contrast to that of enemy Japan.  She actually has very similar underlying facial structure to Zhang Ziyi but the exterior is different.<br /><br />The Southern natives will never secede from The Greater Whole.  The Yuet people welcome the Han; all doors are open to them even without undeserved honors like the title of Grandmaster.  It's on the house just like the Southern pronunciation of poon choi and that is why every emperor worth his salt spent at least 90% of the national budget on building and reinforcing The Great Wall.<br /><br />If you like puns, Foshan sounds like volcano in Cantonese and the Mandarin pronunciation of Dongbei sounds like \\"east evades\\" more so than \\"cold and sad\\" in Cantonese.  Curiously, Ip Man's given name \\"Man\\" means \\"question\\" in Chinese so his name is Leaf Question(s).  What is he asking?<br /><br />When the Accounts Department greet Ip Man 26 minutes, I am reminded because I do need to be reminded that on the matter of Namibia alone, the monsters will pay and it will be by the hand of a precise and just hatred with no silliness.  Why was Michael Jackson a Jehovah's Witness if not because they shared the same murderer as the Namibians?<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />the fight between ZZY and Ip Man resulted in a fair win because ZZY showed at least twice that she was willing to die/fail fighting and if Ip Man had responded unchivalrously, he would have been defeated thoroughly down the road - according to Chinese rules, Ip Man had no other choice than to act as he did.<br /><br />ETA 5/11/2014:  the existence of the Japanese Genyosha (see the wikipedia entry) creates a different view of this film.  The Northern successor becomes a collaborator.  The Southern one to his and his own family's fatal peril refuses while everyone all around him seems to have no problem with doing so.  The proceedings take place at a brothel in the beginning of the film, in the best brothel and the genyosha were known to have set up high end brothels to gather intelligence on wealthy and empowered locals.<br /><br />So they would have known everything.  They would have known about Zhang Ziyi's character as well as Ip Man's.<br /><br />No privacy indeed.<br /><br />So no sympathy for all the alleged suicides occuring amongst the corrupt officials today.  If the central government does not fix this problem, they become the rest of the world's problem.<br /><br />COLLABORATORS!
B005HEVBGG|5.0|The plots were intriguing.  The physics were ahead of its time though much of the physics is still far from proven.  The Doctor was simply great.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I read a lot of reviews before I got this. Guys it is a good one for beginners as well. Just go along with the workout and stop and take a break as you need it until you can do the whole 30 mins without taking a break. The first day I could do it only for 10 mins, second day I could do it for 15 mins then I kept increasing the time like that and now I am able to do the whole 30 mins. I really like it!!
B0032KNA4I|5.0|Put your seat belts on for a worth while ride. ** Do not view this while intoxicated or other --- you might  &#34;FREAK OUT&#34; ---- Visual effects are &#34;WOW&#34;  ----- Some one help me --- I can't stop watching this...
0321934318|5.0|Easy to read and understand. He the author is excellent. One of my favorites. I will buy more of his work.
B0018QCXH8|4.0|Might have to watch this bad boy a couple of times to understand the &#34;Strange Fruit&#34; it delivers. ** Don't give up on it --- very interesting but like taking a bite of a strawberry and getting a mango taste --- nice but unexpected...
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I love these books so much more than 50 Shades of Grey. Why? Gideon. He may be too possesive for my tastes in reality, but in fiction he just rocks. Sylvia Day is a much better writer. The book just flows from one chapter to the other at breakneck speed. Can't wait for the last two!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a book club selection which some members found very disturbing.  The book was well written and I could almost feel the suffering of the main characters.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is one of the best est to the max games there is i am not lieing u should get this game it will be the time of your life
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. If you loved the movie then you are going to love the game as well .
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of Stephen King, but loved The Shining and had to read this book. I found Dan Torrance transition into adulthood believable and true to his family's past. I also liked that it wasn't a retelling of the original story, but used pieces of it that really fit. If you are looking for a continuation of the previous story, you will be disappointed. Dan's life has made some typical turns, but the people he meets on this journey are nothing less than remarkable.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Great show and each season gets better and better. It's been growing in subject and drama and the new additions of other stars has contributed to its appeal.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It does exactly what it is supposed to do.  It goes off, I wake up.  Picking the music you wake up to is a nice touch.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am so sorry to all the people who loved this book, but I found it so boring that I couldn't ever get to the part many call sexy.  I found it to be predictable, poorly written, and just plain boring.  I kept waiting for it to catch my interest.
B00E0SX118|4.0|The further I watched the movie I liked the &#34;morals&#34; and commentary on how people can withdraw into as safe an environment and not face new Ideas. At the end the Croods were enjoying the new world they were living in.  As to the animals presented, no connections to wildlife in the stone age.
B004QX07G4|5.0|This book was very entertaining.  I could hear Ellen's voice as I read the book and see her expressions in my mind.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day hit the cover off the ball with this trilogy.  The books are fantastic. The story pulls you right in and constantly turns you on mentally.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|not much to add, it's an adapter.  works fine, just don't get me started on the fact that my expensive-ass new Mac Book Pro makes obsolete all my Firewire 800 cables.
B006IND5M8|4.0|Like all my rentals, I watched it twice.<br /><br />I thought it had a nice, original script (at least in my limited knowledge thereof) compared to some other movies I've recently seen. However, toward the end I did become disinterested, twice. I don't know if it was *too* long, or what.<br /><br />However, I did like it, and would watch again.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|not much to add, it's an adapter, works fine.  If you can overlook the fact that it's just one more way for Apple to gouge a little more cash out of you...
B00F35B8F8|4.0|I know, original headline.<br /><br />Anyway, it was a good story... although I did like it when it was &#34;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn.&#34; There were a lot of lens flares, and the story was highly recycled.<br /><br />Unoriginality aside, it was a visually-engaging and exciting movie. I would watch it again... as part of an online subscription. Don't think I'd pay to rent it individually.
0307352153|5.0|I am able to understand people better and, as a result of Quiet increasing my awareness of introvert and extrovert people, I approach them differently. And, as a result, I'm getting better reception and responses, both from people I know well and those that I don't know well.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent!  One of the best books I've read lately.  She really makes her characters come alive and you feel their emotions.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Over all a good app. It's relatively easy to use and takes only a little time to figure out how to use. I don't like that I can't copy email addresses out of emails to paste them in another.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|I feel like a five-star review implies perfection, and it wasn't perfect, but I did love the film. I absolutely adored it.<br /><br />I'm not a Shakespeare fan and at first I was worried: worried because it was in black and white (I watched the trailer so I don't know how I didn't realize it was going to be B&W) and worried that I wouldn't be able to follow along with the language. And yes, the first five minutes were hard for me to grasp. But then I found myself listening to the actors' tone and watching their body language and everything made perfect sense.<br /><br />And the black and white really goes perfectly with the tone; think \\"It Happened One Night\\" or \\"Arsenic and Old Lace.\\" Screwball humor, basically, with just a dash of slapstick in all the right places.<br /><br />The cast was fantastic. It's so good to see some of Whedon's favorites come together. Sean Maher is the perfect villain. And holy hell! I've never seen anything Reed Diamond has been in - I really need to get around to watching Dollhouse - but he just blew me away! I love the way he delivers that \\"mountain of affection\\" line.<br /><br />Like I said, it wasn't perfect, exactly. There's this funeral scene that feels out of place, particularly when it's followed by this balcony conversation that makes it seem like the funeral hasn't happened. But it wouldn't have made any sense if the funeral scene had directly followed the balcony scene, either. I liked the funeral scene on its own...it just didn't seem to fit as a whole.<br /><br />So, nearly perfect. Definitely enjoyable.
B00FFRAKRG|4.0|Closest album to the old Korn Sound in over ten years. A lot of these songs echo the Untouchables sound with just a little peppering of TPOT.<br />Don't let the terrible single \\"Never, Never\\" fool you. This song and \\"Punishment Time\\" suck, but the rest of the album is fantastic and one of<br />my favorite Korn releases to date. Glad they got Head back!!!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Good but to much medical talk in book and explenations.This book is to detailed of the problem he had and it gets boring.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|At first I was unsure if I would like this game, but after playing it for a bit.... I realized how much I was loving it. My son plays it, and so does my boyfriend.. we all enjoy it.. can't wait for the next one to come out.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|I absolutely loved Dave's candid story of his life. Intelligence that you don't often see (read) with other memoirs. I have a whole new respect for him and the battles he endured publicly and privately. I am so thankful that he is a brother in Christ and that I will get the great opportunity of meeting someday....most likely when we see our maker;) Rock on, Mustaine!
B008KRJWEK|4.0|Fun game that is challenging.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to kill some time.  would like to see more scenario driven content.
B0085PFG1U|5.0|This calculator is great. It helped me pass my algebra test.  It has so many things to help with just about any problem.  All it needs is instructions for those who do not understand some of the options.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show really blew me out of the water. The first episode was good, but I thought it would peter out by the end of the first season. Instead, the story plot thickened and there was even some interesting character development.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Like the character development and options it leaves in the storyline.  Just in season one and can't wait to get to rest of the seasons
0345803485|3.0|I chose this rating because I am not like all the rest of the people who think this book is great.  If you are looking for soft porn than this is your book.

B00004S8X5|5.0|This is a great music find for anyone who grew up in the 80's.  Recommend to anyone from that time period.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Part I of this book, dealing with the political situation in Jerusalem and surrounding areas from before Jesus to after Jesus, was fascinating and nothing I'd ever been exposed to in church or other history classes (an engineering education doesn't spend much time on history.)  As described, the place was crawling with people claiming to be messiah, while the Romans kept themselves busy rounding them up and crucifying them.  Part II which concentrates on Jesus himself, draws some conclusions about motivations and actions that seemed difficult to sustain.  Other's seemed perfectly reasonable.  The fact that there's no information as to how those conclusions were drawn is a negative.  Part III gets into why Jesus' story has lasted, and suppositions as to why Jesus became called Christ as opposed to any of the numerous other people of his time saying and doing similar things.  A local pastor and scholar of the historical Jesus, is recommending this book and teaching Sunday morning lectures from it, but also takes issue with some of the scholarly work he's described as sloppy.  The same pastor also teaches university classes on Islam and highly recommends the same author's book, \\"No God but God.\\"  For his published review, see \\"[...]
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|I hope that this is the present and future of pop music.  Not Miley jam-clam.  This is a pure heroine of talent for pop music.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|great game and can't wait for the sequel. loved the story line and the. challenges were just hard enough. hope the sequel is out soon.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey has been the most interesting and entertaining TV series I've ever watched.I look forward to series 4, and hope for more PBS/BBC work of this caliber!
B00F35BV64|1.0|Turn off your mind and you might enjoy this movie.  The movie is cliche filled. It has a weak and uncompelling story. It starts off like a sit com and the story telling does improve somewhat as it goes along.  If you manage to not get thrown out repeatedly by the gaping plot failures like having to bring the Enterprise out of it's ocean hiding spot in order to transport Spock to safety from the inside of a single erupting volcano that if not stopped will somehow destroy the entire planet to 300 year old genetically enhanced villain being able to transport himself from just outside Starfleet headquarters to an isolated location (if I understood correctly)on the Klingon home world, you might be able to accept it for a fun romp of a juvenile version of the cast of the original series.<br /><br />Two thumbs up to the obligatory cat women found in Jim's bed as well as the necessity for the hot science officer to unnecessarily undress in a shuttle while admonishing Jim to face the other way.<br /><br />My best description is that the movie is nothing but a prop of some emo screen writer's fantasy to allow Jim and Spock to have many emotionally charged moments together.
031620157X|5.0|i loved the background story here. Chris Colfer has done an excellent job of creating a world for all the fairy tale characters to live and interact in.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Designed as a fraction calculator and that's what it does. I like it and find it very useful for woodworking. I would recommend it to any one who uses fractions.
B009EA3JDM|4.0|Chris Colfer has really written an excellent book here. i have not seen the movie but the book was fantastic!
B0040FMG2G|5.0|This is a solidly produced, directed and acted film.  Good story, and not dull by any stretch of the imagination (in case you're concerned that seeing 19th century fighting ships in action would be dull).<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The title says it all, you just keep wanting more of the gritty drama associated with Rick and his rag tag group of survivors.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Superb writing, acting, character development, and direction. Amazon wants me to write more: There is nothing about this series that I do not love.
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|Classic action film. Good acting. Good storyline. All in all easy and gun to watch. Bring the popcorn, once started you won't want to leave!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|disappointing, characters quite bland with very little depth<br />plot predictable<br />Only interesting thing was that there was talk by the Russians of deposing Stalin
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved every second, laughed, cried, held my breath wonderful book in every way. Loved  all the many many shades of grey and of Ana too.
0385743564|5.0|Steelheart by Brandon Sanderson is one of the most original books I've read this year.  The whole superhero thing might be wearing thin considering how many authors in the last couple of years have embraced it.  But superheroes, dystopian futures, and love stories rarely seem to mix that well together.  Brandon Sanderson didn't seem to have any trouble.  The fast paced story drives you along making the act of stopping and putting the book down an act of Epic proportion all in itself.  I loved the way the book was paced and the characters, while in some cases a little too shallow; but never so that you didn't care about them or want to know more.  There certainly was a general lack of descriptive detail to a lot of his world building of Newcago.  But in the end the setting was really only the back drop for the events of the book and nothing more.  It was believable enough and perhaps more description would have slowed down the pace of the story too much.  I'm not sure, but Brandon Sanderson makes this masterful work look easy.  I can't wait to read the next book.  And see what the continuing adventurers of the Reckoners are going to look like, and of course, what happens with Firefight(no spoilers....)
B00FPH6PRK|5.0|Absilutely scared me during the daytime!  Plus since it was bases on a true ssmeries of events made it much more intense!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Enjoyed the tour of my old haunt, West Virginia. The  characters were true to life and the story caught you from the beginning. Hope David Baldacci does more with CID Puller, good guy with lots of history in war zones. Fun read.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Kindle doesn't appear to come with a file manager.  If you use your kindle as much as I do you will need one!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The cast, characters, costumes, locations, story line and it's all unpredictable.  Total budget costs of the first season were about &#34;$50-60 million&#34;!!!!
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|got it for grandkids, i hardley ever play it. takes to much time and energy. but the kids love it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I'm just getting started using the game, but I can say the art work is awesome! The game is easy and the game is visually stunning. I may add more to this review as I get farther into it.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Pure heroine is dope.  I've been waiting for music like this for years.  Lana was banging but this is one notch higher.  There is not a wack song on this album.  She switches grooves up to keep you entertained and the writing is very exceptional for her age.  Every time I listen to it I feel like I just robbed a bank and got away with it.  After listening to so much garbage for the last decade and change its good to finally have an authentic artist i can dig.  Do yourself a favor and get this album.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|i knowe lots of people dont like all th sex in the book i felt uncofterble with some seans but there is a warning in the discripchon if u dont like it its your own falt  besids it is a romace book trust me it gets much sweeter inth secon book

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft and now I have it when I can't be on my computer! It's an awesome game, but I wish it had updates faster so we could have more stuff to use and get excited about. I still love the game though! :)
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I gave \\"Waking Up Married\\" the rating because it stopped just randomly. Other then it stopping randomly it was sensational.
B00E89VXQY|5.0|Soundtrack for an excellent movie if you're a Metallica fan.  But if you didn't get to see the movie the soundtrack is the next best thing.  Great performances of songs you know by a band you love.  Two thumbs up!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|The game is good, and would be nice to collect coin more efficiently, but personally, I'd like to know what KRA stands for... someone let me know when they do.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It's a reader... the only thing I don't care for is that sometimes the interface can be a little frustrating, especially when I look at cookbooks.  I tend to jump around looking at recipes and getting ideas, but getting back to the table of contents should be a little easier than swiping back to the beginning. It would be better if there was a corner tap that would take you to the contents.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Beautifully crafted, with reality ready to smack you in the face on every page. Ending as so appropriately needed. Green has made a fiction novel feel like a nonfiction love story.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|overall it is a fun game. once you get four levels open it gets a bit slow just racking up points.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game easey to play. The one thing I do not like is I can not keep the music cut off.
B008JFUNNM|4.0|The story of \\"Captain Phillips\\" was huge news in 2009 as a large container ship, the MV Maersk Alabama, was boarded by pirates off the coast of Somalia. In an age of rampant terrorism, the story was headline news and was so highly publicized that the President of the United States got involved, along with the Navy Seals. To many, it was shocking news that this sort of thing happens. Pirates? Really? These aren't Jack Sparrow, Captain Hook type pirates, these are desperate, vicious, poor pirates in small boats with nothing to lose. These are pirates who are for the most part, under orders of bigger controlling groups who pray upon the desperate lifestyles of the Somali people.<br /><br />Much has been said about the accuracy of the book written by Captain Phillips,  \\"A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy Seals, and Dangerous Days at Sea\\" and now the movie, \\"Captain Phillips\\". In fact, many of the crew of the Maersk Alabama are now suing Captain Phillips for wantonly and arrogantly putting them in danger. They are telling stories that completely contradict much of what you see in the film leading up to the pirates boarding their ship. This to me is extremely disappointing if their stories are true. I believe it is irresponsible for movie-makers to misrepresent history. Many people take the easy way out when learning about history and movies leave a huge impression on their minds.<br /><br />That being said, I assume that most of the movie is completely accurate as most of what happened after the pirates boarded is documented by news outlets and the Navy Seals. Director Paul Greengrass handled the true story with a realistic eye. He's made a niche for himself with 7-true story films, the most recognizable of those being \\"United 93\\". His staging of events is engrossing, vivid and at times tough to watch.<br /><br />\\"Captain Phillips\\" is listed as an action/thriller, but those viewing the film would be quick to mention that this movie shouldn't be lumped in with the typical action movie. I would consider \\"Captain Phillips\\" more a drama than an action/thriller.  You are side by side Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) through this realistic and horrible incident with pirates who cannot be accused of being intelligent, but are certainly without a morale code or an alternative to their actions.<br /><br />The movie is tough to watch at times and possibly a little long, but for the most part it is an amazing look inside one of the biggest news stories of 2009. The pirates, although portrayed realistically are infuriating to watch and annoying to watch. From beginning to end they are amazingly fool-minded, disorganized and constantly angrily yelling. I agree that these portrayal's are probably extremely accurate, but as a movie, they are like listening to 10 people yelling different stories at each other for over an hour.<br /><br />\\"Captain Phillips\\" is not for everybody and there's a reason why the creators called this an action/thriller. If they told you what it really was, you probably wouldn't go. \\"Captain Phillips\\" is not fun to watch and far from thrilling. It is not filled with harrowing and exciting bravery at every corner. It is not filled with twists and turns. It is a dirty, difficult and drudging film that tells the story of real people in a horrible and real situation. If you like that sort of thing, go see it.ical action movie. I would consider \\"Captain Phillips\\" more a drama than an action/thriller.

B005HEK3JW|5.0|These things are hard to beat, classic shows that are so original.  The cast of characters are pretty awesome.  I was always such a fan of the old Start Trek and when the TNG debuted I did not want anything to do with it, I was faithful to the old one.  But then I finally saw an episode of TNG and that was all it took, I was sold.  You can't beat these old shows.  AAAAA++++++

I did not look forward to reading it like I did with his previous books. His other books were very well written whereas I did not think this was well put together.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|This is a fun game but buggy. I recommend that you do not buy any pearls, algae or coins.  You can play up to about level 30 and then the bugs begin.  No fun when that happens.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Captivating story with great character development. This would make a spellbinding movie of intertwined people and cascading events. Couldn't put it down!
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|Beautifully done.  Felt like you were really there!  You couldn't tell what was real and what was special effects.  The acting even by the kids was superb!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Interesting reading. I think it really paints diverse scenarios and communities that would pop up in any post apocalyptic world
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Hard be beat a classic.  I am biased as I am British and saw the original. Very Well done!!  Good production.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This film is as amazing as each one of the Lord of the Rings films! Everyone should see this film!
B000I55YV2|5.0|Almost literally as if you stop watching you will miss an important part.  Well produced and exciting, no time to get bored.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I am not a Harry Potter fan but purchased this as a gift for someone who is and so far the person I gave it to is really happy with it.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|My kids love Star Wars and this was by far the cheapest set around.  As a plus it's also blue-ray.
1476734941|4.0|After saying that the fast diet is a simple diet and that the book is well written there isn't much else to say, so this is a quick review of the book. After reading the entire book, I honestly feel as though two pages would have been enough to cover the essentials of the diet. The rest of the material is really to 1) present good reasons to diet from both male and female perspectives, 2) build a case for this diet and demonstrate that there is a scientific basis for why it works with plenty of supporting research, 3) Give copious written and visual examples of what you will eat on fast days to allay any fears of being starved or deprived, and 4) Show that the diet has worked for people by providing many testimonials in the form of letters and emails. The book follows the same format and dialog as the PBS special almost word for word so there are no surprises if you'd seen the special. THE DIET WORKS because of it's simplicity and is easy to remember and adjust to. The fast diet is a simple diet that is well balanced and helpful. I used the diet and have lost 30 pounds so far.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Mr. Kyle did a great job telling his story and experiences. He doesn't sugar coat anything but tells things on such a way you get the picture. Loved his account.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|She has beautiful songs<br />my favorites are<br />honeymoon avenue, baby I, nerver know and Almost is never enough<br />the album is very enjoyable and you can hear it many times without get tired of it.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Just what I needed to get a quick nap without having to reset alarm clock.that way I can use it where ever I go
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|This book gripped me from the first page and continued until the last dot - I could not put it down.<br /><br />A book totally equal to the Stig Larsson trilogy - if not dare I say - even better.<br /><br />A suspense novel par excellence.<br /><br />There has to be a movie to follow such a book -<br /><br />Am so happy to have read it - but it makes it very difficult to chose a successor
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The idea is awesome. However it only works for some applications.<br />1.  If you use your ipad you cant have the ipad 1 because the ipad 1 does not support the ios upgrade that the Netflix and youtube apps needs to update.<br /><br />2.  Only Netflix, youtube, and hulu works with it. I bought the device thinking my tv will simply mimic what is on my computer or ipad. but it only streams from certain apps.<br /><br />3.  Sound is an issue when I attempt the web browser casting. I thought this would be a way around only having certain applications that worked with the device. It does display my computer screen, but no sound is transmitted.<br /><br />With that said I hope there is more versatility with different applications in the future. That would make my rating go up. For now im better off using my hdmi cable to plug in my laptop
B00DY951RQ|4.0|Great package, but a dozen of the book pages were &#34;welded&#34; together at the bottom and so one had to rip the page or simply never read it. By the time I discovered this, the return window had expired.<br /><br />Great volume though ; I would rank it only behind the original and Tell Tale Signs.
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|I haven't built any LEGO set in years, thought I would go build one because they came up with this DeLorean set. The finished product is great and you can customize it to different types of DeLorean in each of the three movies! The instruction is pretty clear but lack of coloring had me second guessed myself a few times on which color block to use and they are two different shades of grey!<br /><br />As mentioned, I hadn't built any set in years so I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to finish it or it would be too complicated or extremely challenging. So the plan was to dedicate the whole weekend to build it! But to my disappointment, it's not complicated at all! (well, apart from the unclear coloring in the instruction book). I finished it in a few hours and had to live the rest of my weekend without any plan. So if you want something to do for the whole weekend with only $35 to spend, this LEGO DeLorean is not your answer. But it is very cool though!
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Love this movie!  I have watched it at least 15 times and it never gets old - oh- and my kids love it too:&#62;)
B009D5VNLS|4.0|My daughter is 8, and was really scared during the growly bear scenes.  She got over it by the time the dvd came out, but as she left the theater she told me she did not want to buy this movie.  That is our barometer of how much she liked it.  Sort of weird to make a Princess movie that little girls can't embrace. I talked to lots of other parents who had the same experience as I had.  I loved the movie, but parents with young girls should be aware that the bear scenes are too scary for some kids.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Initially, the rhythm of the writing go in the way but I adjusted to that. I loved the.story, the characters and the ending.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I have always liked the show but never saw the complete series. I have enjoyed catching up on the whole series at one time.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Excellent. She sticks to her beliefs and is a great role model. Didn't see end coming. Don't know if I'm happy about it, but I get it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first two Hunger Games books.  I found this to be the weakest of the series and overly dark in general.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Thank you. It is nice to see the stories one after another without any commercials interrupting. We are enjoying them.
B0013A1T8I|5.0|I love this movie very enchanting. I will watch is over and over again. The kids will love it as well.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game and I especially love playing it on my kindle<br />I also have it for the iphone but playing it on the kindle is so much better.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I never would have imagined getting hooked on this show (I'd never even wanted to watch a single episode), but it happened.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Engaging well written book about married and love affair loss and  recovered love. Well developed characters with interesting twist and turns in their families. A very good read
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great books, seems like this series brings people to either love or hate them. Don't judge until you have read them all, the story line to me is good. And I have definitely cried several times through out. Really enjoyed them.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|This was a great CD. I love almost every song on here. Lana del Rey has said that this CD is about her problems when she drank a lot when she was younger and understanding makes a lot of the songs even better.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|Anyone with an ear for real, superior musicianship, needs to hear JM! Prince led me 2 her, and ive been on board since her 1st cd! Brilliant artist!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app works well for its intended purpose, a basic calculator. The keys are large and easy to use and equation solutions are accurate.<br />I
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Except that it is in 3D.  I've always had difficulty with spatial relationships and I feel like this game is really helpful on that front.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|It is even better than the first!!!!!!!!!! I Iike that all the characters are included. It is a great and fun game to play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BEIYMIS|4.0|'True Story' haunted house and possession movies are a dime a dozen these days. Anything that can be cheaply made by studios to rake in tons of dough at the box office are automatics (this is why Paranormal Activity could essentially continue on forever). In my mind the definitive haunted house movie will always be The Poltergeist, and the standard equivalent of the possession movie will always be The Exorcist. Not surprising right?<br /><br />However, both of those movies were not specifically based on true stories. This is where The Conjuring comes in. You can only sing the same song so many times before it gets old and tiresome, The Conjuring puts a genuine twist on the story by making it feel like every moment in the film is honest and forthright without using the 'documentary' style filmmaking (which I always thought was a cheap gimmick). The use of the practical makeup helps recreate the feel that The Exorcist gave us the first time we saw it. It is also worth noting that James Wan, director of the original Saw and Insidious, continues his successful efforts here as a horror filmmaker.<br /><br />The Conjuring will grip and horrify you like very few movies can these days. I promise it will be one of the scariest movies that you will ever see.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I like hidden object games, they are really fun. This game is really fun and I like to play it.I have nothing bad to say about the game. If you like hidden games then give this one a try.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Thought provoking for parents who read this. Our book club ate it up and we had some lively conversation about it.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great story, great acting, amazing special effects. JJ Abrams did it again with this one. Looking forward to the third!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I love it its amazing ive been looking for a video app for a year now and now I've finally found the right one for me
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Why did this movie do so well at the box office?? There is nothing interesting or new about this movie. Save your time/money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|In love with this game very fun I can play the game all day once you start you will not be able to stop!!!
B00FEN000S|5.0|This is a great flick-- loved it in the theatre and happy I couldnt purchase it now. Fingers crossed they make a sequel!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|A fun hunting game for a tablet.<br /> It is about time that make a good hunting game.<br />Best part the game is FREE
B00FPH6M82|4.0|It was full of great imagination and the story was great. needed a little more but leaves it open for another.
B008XG1X18|5.0|You can find almost anything on this site from recipies to fashion to crafting. Pin your favorites to your own boards. This is just a light explaination of this app. This creators of this site also continue to do updates, which are always helpful updates.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I found Angry Birds Star Wars II, not only fun, but very challenging !  I enjoyed playing it very much !  I was sorry to come to the end.  Please, Rovio-----we need more games !!!!
B00DVPN30A|5.0|Let me begin by saying I am a huge Amos Lee fan.  I have been since his first album.  I am in love with this one.  I should mention that there is one that I occasionally skip through, but the album has been on repeat since I received it on Tuesday.  The addition of Alison Krauss on 'Chill in the Air' and Patty Griffin on 'Mountains of Sorrow' seals the deal for me.  Best Americana album I've heard in years.  I hope everyone realizes it!
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|This book was excellent.  Very much like the series, I loved it.recommend it highly.  Want to.read the next.one.  should sill love it.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. From the begening of the movie till the end the movie is jam packed with fun!. Loved this movie
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I use to play a similar app on my phone but came across this one on my Kindle Fire HD. It's way better and definitely makes you think. I love it.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Wasn't really much of a Science Fiction Movie.  Mostly a boy to man movie about survival.  Very disappointing. Acting was also sub par.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I've read this book 3 times now & it gets better with every read!  I have several family members who served during WWII, 1 jumped on D-Day, 1 was a medic patching guys up on Omaha Beach, to read this gave me great insight to what that generation went thru as well as reinforcing my respect for how well I have it in the Air Force now compared to the conditions they faced.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|This is a stretch even for a comic book character.  Just too many totally unbelievable things happening. Special effects were good.
B00EDPFJA4|4.0|I think Drake is a phenomenal artist, this is a great album! I gave this four stars because when I received it, the cover was cracked.
B00EZ6ZJAQ|5.0|I just have this grinder for a few days (will write an update and give impression about it) but so far I find it excellent. It is my first grinder, and I chose it after having read all these reviews of other manual action ceramic grinders having the problem of requiring a 'death grip' to use, or having to 'turn the grinder for a long time' and eventually the users give up and buy electric ones, So I was looking for a full featured manual ceramic grinder that was easy to use. This grinder has a neat feature of a suction base, and boy does it WORK! After activation, it feels like the grinder was bolted down into my granite counter top (will only work on relatively smooth surfaces I think).  After a few uses and one wash with running water, the grounds no longer flew everywhere after pulling the drawer out, now the grounds stay put in the tray, with the occasional few grounds escaping around the side of the collecting tray and collecting at the bottom of the main grinder house (where the suction silicone base area is). Thankfully it is completely disassemble-able. The lid even has a slot so that if you screw off handle (nut and threads are nicely machined and have a solid feel, and smooth screw/unscrew action that glides) the hand fits into a small slot on the side of the lid into the main body such that the lid is 'locked' into place so it wont fall off/be lost and the whole unit is compact. Oh those clever space conscious Japanese designers, well done!<br /><br />I find grinding a pleasure with the sound of the grinding, and the easy action of the wide turning arm while the main housing is firmly attached to the counter. No death grip, hurray! Filling the upper tray about 80% of the way you can grind about one &#34;2 cup&#34; mokapot coffee grounds basket. The grinds form a 'mound' underneath the ceramic burrs, and you may need to 'tap' the side of the grinder to have the grinds settle so when you pull out the tray, the grounds aren't spilled and left back in the main housing.<br /><br />It is made out of plastc, so there is some static, much worse on the first grind but got better after subsequent grinds and a rinse with water once. I like it so much I think I will give it away as a gift.  For the price range of grinders ranging from $25-$110, this grinder is not the cheapest, but for the features, I think it's worth it. Anyway, it's the ceramic burr that we all really want. All the other features are for user friendliness and of which this one is overflowing with nice little features. My only redesign would be: upper tray is some what 'loose' and while grinding, will tend not to stay in one place and bounce around in the main housing a bit. I would also consider making the housing metal or glass instead of plastic to reduce static transfer.<br /><br />I use a 'coarse' setting for use with the moka pot (looks like a setting of '5' from my local grocer) with French Roast from Pete's Coffee, and the results are astounding, makes home made coffee so much more fun and enjoyable in the mornings :)
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I found it difficult to put down. made me see the situation handicapped people are in with a realistic point of view. The emotions of everyone involved were extremely thought provoking. It made me really feel for everyone involved but at the same time it kept me in suspense about how it was all going to end.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Even though we all think that a sentence served in Federal prison is a cake walk, this book depicts it as difficult, lonely and scary.  The author voices her opinion about some of the crazy reasons inmates end up in prison, and I agree with her assessment that we are incarcerating the little guys in alarming rates.
B009QU9X44|4.0|it was very surprising to identify so much with a Nigerian. The book made me realise how much we Africans have in common. Well written and very sensitively expressed.
B004PGO25O|4.0|An even more concise &#34;how to&#34; than his highly-regarded The War of Art.<br />Do The Work is a well-explained step by step manual that is actually deeply perceptive: one of those books you immediately read right through because it has plenty of 'A-ha' moments balanced with great commonsense.<br />Unreservedly recommended!<br />Chris
B008Y212PI|4.0|The game follows a very basic puzzle concept that is easy to pick up, but also can make you think with some patterns. My grandfather doesn't quite get it, though, when I tried teaching him with the tutorial.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Yes this is the best thing on TV right now. I like the cast and can't wat for the next esepoed to play. My Wief and her  fried even like it so much they ask on Monday when does it con on. Hello Tuesday!  Cant wait.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|As an adult, Dan Torrance becomes an alcoholic like his father - something he swore he'd never be but thinks of himself as being \\"different\\" from Jack. He's a drifter, working and living in various places.<br /><br />Dan gets on a bus and ends up in a small town in New Hampshire. He eventually ends up with one of his typical jobs: working at a nursing home. Dan earns the nickname \\"Doctor Sleep\\" at the nursing home as he is able to ease elderly patients through their last moments. He's assisted by a cat named Azzie, who seems to know before Danny does when a patient is about to die, visiting them in their rooms to alert the nurses to call Dan.<br /><br />The shining may have diminished since he got older, but it's still with Dan. I won't reveal any details; I'll just say it's not pretty. One interesting vision he has is of a top hat. He doesn't realize it belongs to Rosie the Hat, the leader of a band called the True Knot; vampire-like beings who live on \\"steam.\\" Steam happens to be the essence a child's shining.<br /><br />Arriving home one afternoon, Dan he finds the chalkboard in his room above the nursing home has been erased and the word \\"Hello\\" written on it. Thus begins his relationship with Abra, a young girl who possesses a very strong shining. She first communicated with Dan when she was just a baby. Abra and Dan develop a close bond; she refers to him as Uncle Dan.<br /><br />Not long after Dan meets Abra he realizes she's in trouble: the True Knot wants her shining to maintain their immortality. Can Dan save Abra from the torture and death the True Knot have planned?<br /><br />I have to admit, I was a bit confused about the True Knot at first and how they fit into the story. Further into the book more about them is revealed, so that helped a lot. There were times I absolutely couldn't put down my Kindle! It's quite an interesting read; I also heard a movie might be made from it; I'd definitely go see it.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, but it dragged on and on.  Counterintuitive to what you expect from King it's long on character development and short on real action.  Picks up some in second half, when the characters are moving towards the finale it picks up steam, but even the finale is over so quick I wasn't clear it was even over.  If you love The Shining as much as I do you probably have to read it, and it won't be a complete waste, but it is not up to the quality of the source material.  Not even close.<br /><br />Last I'd say someone really needs to talk to King about AA being anonymous.  A little heavy on the details in this book.  So much AA...That's from someone who is very open to the program, Stephen...and a huge fan.  Of both you and the program.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I was able to use this app for a long time, but I logged out and now it won't let me back in!!!!
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun game! I got to level 30 and the game's memory wiped clean for no reason and I lost all my progress. So frustrating!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son wanted this on his Kindle Fire. It downloaded and installed easily. He likes it real well. So I will recommend this app.
B00FVS4EUI|1.0|I went through amazon because I thought they were the best for getting the new episodes up the day after airing because I work third shift. I come home to find that the episodes there, but apparently because I pre ordered the season I can't watch it. I expect to get what I paid for.. The one star is for service.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|Game gas great graphics and gameplay, however, the game is slow to load on my kindle fire. iPad version much faster. The android version has glitches and sometimes when you buy something from App Store game will not restart or is very slow to do so. The version for IPad does not have these problems. The android game just needs a little work to run as good as the Apple version. But over all on either platform this is a game I really enjoy.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy Spider a lot, and to be able to be mobile and play is great. The game goes fast, while being very entertaining.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is one of the best books ever written! I would definetely recommend this to anyone! This is so full of action, it kept me on the edge of my seat for hours! I couldn't put it down!!!!!!!
B001ECE6C6|4.0|Found this album a really interesting way of introducing Metheny standards in an innovative new light. The traditional pieces while unfamiliar,brought something interesting to the album aswell.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What a great (and long awaited) follow up to The Shining.  I love Danny's story - his life of being a tortured soul and how he struggled to defeat his demons.  And Abra is just adorable.  King never stops appealing to me with his plain speak writing style.  Characters are deep and well rounded, as usual, and the good vs. evil in this one is epic.
B00C2C637I|3.0|I recall reading the story and watching the film as a child (20+ years ago). I loved it then, but am a little disappointed with it now. The themes are overt and, whilst the prose is engaging, are hammered in over and over.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|This is one of the best television shows I have ever seen. The acting and writing are incredible. The portrayal of how the murder of a child affects a small town is charged with complex emotions. The relationships between the characters are intense. David Tennant leads an incredible cast with a deeply rooted and remarkably poignant performance. At moments, the intensity of the emotion can be a bit too heavy, however the pay off at the conclusion of the 8 episodes is well worth the sacrifice. Excellent show.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|Love this band and love this album. I love that you get the MP3s along with the CD. This one was well worth the wait.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This app is so fun because adding adjectives Maxwell is better and compared to the ds this is the best game ever
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold is one of my favorite bands. I just love M Shadow and this is a fantastic album. It's been a wait between albums but it was definitely worth it.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Fortunately I got mine from a reputable and sanctioned dealer, so no problems like others have reported in the area of getting counterfeit models and thus bad performance.  This thing is amazing at amplifying my cell phone and the built in equalizer modes do an amazing job at either enhancing the music or adding substantial bass. I didn't put much faith into this little unit as it is just so tiny, but it holds its own for sure. I ended up velcroing it, so I can switch between the phone and tablet. When you first get these units there is a process to verify its authenticity, which is cool.  It allowed me to read up on other aspects of these amps and the most important to me is that as this is a battery with amp technology when it dies...it is dead and unrepairable...at least by FiiO. They make no qualms about making this clear and that once dead it has to be replaced not repaired.  I am sure there are some hardware hackers out there that disagree, but this is the official stance from FiiO.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I enjoy this game on my Kindle Fire.  It's good to pass the time away when you're traveling, or whenever.
