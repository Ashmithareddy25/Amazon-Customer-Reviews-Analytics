B000UJ48WC|5.0|'The Shining', written by Stephen King and published in 1977, was adapted into a feature film in 1980 and was directed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick. It starred Jack Nicholson in all his insane glory and since then has been a staple of horror and suspense film \\"best of\\" lists. In fact, only a very small handful of films in history have elicted as much fear as \\"The Shining\\". It is an exercise in pure terror and a masterclass on filmmaking. What Stanley Kubrick accomplished with \\"The Shining\\" was a perfect marriage of twisted psychosis, the supernatural, horror, isolation, and ambiance. No other movie makes you feel more claustrophobic and alone than does \\"The Shining\\". From the beautiful hotel settings to the snow covered hedge maze, the movie has stunning locations and sets and succeeds brilliantly in surrounding the viewer and sucking them into the snowbound and disturbed world of Jack Torrance and the Overlook Hotel.<br /><br />As usual, I will refrain from explaining the plot as it has been done to death on here, and frankly I doubt if there are very many people out there who haven't seen it, or don't know what its about. In the smallest of nutshells, it's a ghost story and a story of survival against the odds and against unseen forces. If I were ranking all-time horror/suspense films, then \\"The Shining\\" comes in at number four on my list, just behind the seminal films \\"Psycho\\", \\"Jaws\\", and \\"Halloween\\" respectively (with Wes Craven's original \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" rounding out the top 5). That is amazing company and \\"The Shining\\" more than deserves a spot among the best of it's peers.
B0081I08CI|4.0|\\"...most of the population suffers through life, barely surviving, disappointed and confused day after day, hopeless, wondering what happened to their strong and beautiful country...\\" -Steven Van Zandt<br /><br />The entire Game of Thrones series is written like a weekly serial, were each episode ends in a cliffhanger. Every chapter is filled with hardships and yet there is no glory. Surviving is the ultimate goal, but why would any of the characters want to continue on in this way?<br /><br />Life is so harrowing and so grim in the landscape Martin writes for us,that it seems death would provide a pleasant surcease by comparison to the endless struggle to survive.<br /><br />I've finished the third book in the series and started the fourth. The reviews for each will be the same, more or less. And that is due to the fact the books are the same, more or less.<br /><br />I'm truly sorry I started the series, and yet I've invested so much time in these books, I'm now committed to finding out if the author will ever let me rejoice.<br /><br />Getting through this series has begun to feel like a destructive co-dependent relationship.<br /><br />Review written by Shelley Riley author of [[ASIN:1482679248 Casual Lies-A Triple Crown Adventure]]
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game I am rating it because every week has special events and I am always looking for the daily change letters that's why the game is so cool.
B003L77GH4|2.0|I got this for my daughter, who loves all this nonsense. As far as I am concerned, not for me.
B005UBNKZG|4.0|I have had this processor now for about a year, and I am pretty impressed with it to be honest.  When I first got it though I did have a few issues.  First of all it was extremely loud with the stock cooler.  I can deal with that though pretty much every component on my computer is loud.  But as loud as it was you would THINK it would be cooling the processor pretty well.  No, definitely not.  The stock cooler is not sufficient for a processor that runs as naturally warm as the Bulldozers do. I was in bios and idle speeds of +40c.  I didn't even bother gaming on it for fear of damaging it and my board.<br /><br />I replaced the stock cooler with the Antec 620.  This made a HUGE difference.  On stock clock it was only a little over 20c. When I got around to running AMDs overdrive it got to 5ghz stable and only then was it back to 40c at idle.  I of course didn't want to tax the processor that much and dialed it back down to 3.8ghz. That said, many people run 4ghz+ regularly without issue but I don't need to push it that hard because I have seen zero issues at the current rate.<br /><br />So the final verdict is that when you see this processor at a good price (I paid $115.00 from warehouse deals)  it is worth getting.  BUT remember that you MUST include the price of a cooler in there too, I paid $60 for the ANTEC liquid cooler.<br /><br />For reference purposes here is a list of my system specs<br />AMD 8120 Black<br />Saphire AMD 7870 graphics card<br />16gb corsair 1600 Ram<br />MSI 970A-G46 motherboard<br /><br />Common programs I use:<br />Photoshop<br />Arma 3 DayZ<br />Sim City (2013)<br />Planet Side 2<br />Battlefield 3<br />Neverwinter
B00821OX98|5.0|I have been watching this series nearly since its start and watched the opening episode as I missed it the first time around.  To me, this is a well-thought out story, well-played by its cast (without exception), and well done in all other judgement criterion.  Thanks to Amazon for obtaining it to run in Prime Videos!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great for a quick puzzle pick me up! Easy enough to avoid frustration. Just hard enough to make it fun.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really cool game. Fun for puzzle lovers. Not too difficult but still somewhat challenging. I can't wait for more levels!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Just as Fall of Giants, Follett delivers a memorable recap of the people of WWII.  Too often we have books about military strategies or the technical aspect of war.  This book reminds you of the people and their many perspectives.  He does an amazing job of having you long for all the characters to win, no matter their country of origin.  This book will not disappoint and will leave you waiting for the third book in the trilogy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Such a great show! Just when you think you know what will be coming they surprise you! Can't wait for season 4!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game that is for people of all ages, had challenges to complete and you get to experience what it is like having a horse, the only problem is it sometimes crashes unexpectedly but is always up and running again in a few minutes.
0451197968|4.0|It was a good read for diversion,  My son read this as required summer reading and he enjoyed it.  We even picked up the movie with Arnold Schwartznager but he said the book was better.
B000W4D94I|5.0|love this  movie<br />you wont be sorry you got this<br />you can watch with your  boy friend or kids<br />thank  you  got this on time
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Great songs start to finish hearing a good old school metal song is hard to find but not any more WOW<br />cant be Tony on guitar Geezer  on bass  n the voice Ozzy  only one missing but still a great alum
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Son loves it. He is addicted. H ha ha great to keep him occupied and still for more than 5 min.
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|The fact that I'm a devoted fan of Dustin Hoffman, and Maggie Smith, among others made this especially great fun for me.  The story is unique, the acting is awesome, and the home and scenery Is wonderful.  As a former opera singer,  I think this would be an awesome retirement.  :).  This is a film to enjoy repeatedly.<br /><br />Jeannie<br />Louisville, Ky
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good little game, challenging yet not overly complicated. Thoughtful enough to keep you entertained but not so complicated that it interferes with game play. Quite a good game would recommend to others.
B00D4PDJMY|2.0|I don't know. I think Phil is either way beyond me in his music, or he's lost his way. This album to me seems to chaotic. The music is totally Phil and I doubt that there is any debating that aspect, but I need a little more... \\"groove\\" to the song arrangements. In Down there are good breakdowns and decent hooks that make me feel the emotion, intensity and overall vibe. This particular album would make it look like I'm doing \\"The Elaine\\" with full-body seizures.<br /><br />It could totally be that I'm just not on the same artistic plain as Phil yet. Could be a good album in a couple years, but not at this time.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|It was practically new. It came before the delivery date. It was barely used and I really do like MJ's music.
B001FA0NZ6|3.0|There where some very good tips, tricks, and advice. But some of it was not very useful for me but over all it was a good book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging!<br />I often require assistance via the web but still enjoy the cleverness of the game's designers.  Can't wait for more levels.
B00DHNB5CY|1.0|I wish I could give this movie 0 stars. There is a difference between a scary movie and a gore fest. And this movie was just that. It was a gory mess and the story line was none existent. Loosing your debit card is scarier than this movie.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is possibly the best book I've ever read with consideration to the impact it has made on my life. Forget about programs like Insanity and P90x; save your money. You can get great results by following the advice laid out in this book. Mike Matthews thoroughly explains workout and nutrition and even provides a bonus report that contains workouts for an entire year. These workouts are short (45-60 minutes) with low reps, so you are in and out of the gym, feeling good, and will see amazing results. By following the nutrition, supplement, and workout guidelines, I have gained 12 pounds moving from 128 to 140 in just 2 months (I may have gained some fat as well as I ate more than the calorie recommendations in the book)! I feel so much stronger and more energetic. One recommendation: there is a lot of material covered in this book, so don't just read the book. Take some notes as well on the pertinent information that you need to remember (a lot of the book covers research behind the claims which makes it more credible, but this information is not necessary to remember so you can skip it in your notes). Get working!
B004SUWR2C|3.0|The rules change on you with out being fair at times. It gets annoying B-) it your determined to win.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games ever I play this game all the time  like i said before I love it hope you will like it
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I'm just getting to know how to run this. Some times it gets slow. I'm hoping that I rd shot Nabisco. It's cool to see YouTube's.videos.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|his game has everything a game should have.<br />it truly does have everything a game should have.<br />my opinion is that I loved it.  I truly do.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|He is my favorite Doctor and this screwdriver is wonderful. The ink pen part and the UV light mixed with the &#34;invisible ink&#34; part are all amazing. The sounds and adjustable parts are great. I absolutely love this.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|A great singer with some  standouts and others not so memorable .Probably  not quite  as strong  as the last album
B002MGIIZE|5.0|Donnie Darko defines an era of frivolty and expressionism. It demands attention to the Billionaire club depicted in the movie
B00BIVN82M|4.0|The classics are  well done but there are some songs you probably wouldn't choose for a major release. The originals are catchy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I Love where it is filmed I love all the actors Brilliant cannot wait for season 4 hoping for more surprises
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Good topic, lots of action with real assault rifles that do a good job doing what they were designed to do! The liberal anti-gunners should watch this and get a clue!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I watch this in spurts, as I stream episodes...it's a little melodramatic, so there are times I'm not in the mood for that. I think the story line is good; characters are complex and worth watching. The &#34;husband&#34; just did something I didn't like and I found myself stopping the program. Just didn't want to see what was going to happen!<br />If that's the mark of a &#34;believable&#34; show, the writers and producers have done well.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Not a basic backpack!<br />This backpack is anything but basic. Amazon has out itself with this product, It arrived a head of its scheduled due date. This backpack may look small in stature but is anything but. It has numerous compartments and I am able to fit my equipment in securely. I absolutely love it. Yes I would reccommend this anything but Basic Backpack by Amazon to Everyone. Amazon You Rock with This Product.<br /><br />Loving my Backpack!
0802473156|5.0|I love [[ASIN:1885705026 Please Understand Me II: Temperament, Character, Intelligence]] for its indepth breakdown of the human psyche, but is is a little heavy for most people and really doesn't help one understand how to apply the material.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0802473156 The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Lasts]] provides five emotional communication techniques to use with significant others to develop and maintain a healthy relationship. The book comes from a mildly Christian background and is a little heavy on the \\"women be obedient and stay in the relationship\\" end of things, but is a practical application of technique rather than an academic treatise. I would love to see the Meyers-Briggs temperaments matched up to the five languages.<br /><br />I was introduced to these concepts years ago by a family member and have used the five languages to show appreciation at work and through other relationships. I have found the five languages close to real life.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I can hardly wait until I get the next season of Bones. Seasons 1- 6 is so great. As usual these DVDs exceeded my expectation with exciting episodes, drama, suspense and romantic involved too.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love it except when it updated I can't connect with fb therefore it lost  some of its appeal. N it lost my high score n goals n what not
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|the Game just doesn't hit my hot button. I tried it and then uninstalled it, I'm not saying its a bad game, I prefer other games.

B006N0YWGY|4.0|It Takes A Bit of time To start Liking this Game, then its somewhat addicting. It gets a little harder  to stop playing. I would recommenced it to a  friend.
0061353248|5.0|This book reflects excellent research, valid experiments and is extremely well written.  Humans are a fascinating subject...and we are so predictably unpredictable.
0679805273|5.0|One of the best books ever! I bought it for a baby shower, but it's not a really little kids book, it has an incredible message about life and carrying on through hard times and all sorts of things.<br /><br />There is a paper shell cover over the book, but I've noticed that paper covers get worn down fast and look ratty. Never fear, the book has an identical finished cover so you can just remove the paper sleeve once it gets worn.<br /><br />Second time I've bought this book for a new baby, and I'll continue to get it!
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|Great light, when positioned on stair case or hall, comes on instantly when motion detected and goes off immediately when motion stops. Really saves on energy. The batteries last forever since get goes off so quickly. Great light, great design.<br />Jack C.

B008ZOHCKE|2.0|It was difficult to navigate thru books.I do not know how many notebooks I have downloaded in the past years hoping to find one that works well.  I removed it within two days.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  I'm not sure that I believe everything that I read but that is true of most books that I read on similar subjects.  The book does a good job of describing the general atmosphere and civilization before, during (briefly) and after the birth of Jesus of Nazareth.  It is all very interesting but of course as with most of the research from that era, open to interpretation, which is understandable.  After all, so many of the writings from that time have been translated, rewritten, restated and generally used to tell a narrative possibly at odds with the original writer's intent; and knowing who the original writer was in many cases is also unknown and unknowable (the 4 main gospels for example).  But having said all that, if you can keep an open mind, enjoy learning more about that time and are not looking for something to confirm or rebut your current knowledge/beliefs this is a good read.  The references used to write the book are worth the price of the book as a great list of future reading material.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Fast shipping and a great product and price.  Easy to install on wall with one person.  Grandkids love their room away from home.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This was the perfect beach read. I didn't have to think too hard, and I got lots of laughs out of it. Relaxing and entertaining.
B00H0BFUCA|5.0|I like trying to keep up with Glee, although sometimes I fall behind.  This show is a little escape for me for my work day.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keeps the mind going. Rooms change and objects get harder to find. My kids like playing to see who gets highest.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I watched this series from start to finish using downloads from Amazon.  Other sites had it but not every single episode....and Amazon downloads and streams with one click!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This app lives up to it's stellar reputation.  It's a mix of hidden objects and fun logic puzzles. I gave it four instead of five stars due to the characters lengthly verbage.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|This is a blackly funny, dark, complex, human story of madness and despair brought on by the trauma of the bombing of Dresden. An entire city was wiped out in one night of fire and devastation. This becomes the central but not exclusive focus of this deep and sober book. The genius of the book is to convey the life changing effects of that night within a strange logic of time travel and alien abductions. And it is deeply funny throughout. A brilliant book.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Enough said in the title. I didn't want to put the book down, but if I didn't, the emotions would become overwhelming. This is a brilliant frame narrative.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This book is a must read. Hilarious. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to read this book again. But this book now.
B008RZF2I0|5.0|awesome cd. I have listened to it about a dozen times and might be getting it autographed by the band in september.

B003MC5N28|3.0|I was loving this book.  Great atmosphere and creation of new society.  Really good characters.  At The society is totally scripted, At with requirements for instant apologies, dinnertime exploration of feelings and debugging drams in the morning.  At age12, each child is assigned his profression, our hero is given the job of Rememberer.  There is only one Rememberer, who holds all the memories at a time, so his teacher the last Rememberer becomes the giver.<br /><br />After working together a year, the two decide to give the memories back to the populace. Why?  Now they can learn about color and snow and love.  But they are also exposed to pain and war and hunger.<br /><br />We Don't know how the society reacts, because the book just ends.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|The biggest mystery is how come this game takes sooooo long to load. OMG seriously this game takes forever to load.  I've timed it ... at least one and one half minutes between chapters.  Even longer at the beginning of the game before and after you press &quot;start.&quot;  Great graphics but play is so slow it becomes boring.

B0090SI582|3.0|With its modern-day sensibilities and philosophical and moral questions about genetics, the \\"X-Men\\" comic series has always been tailor-made for a movie treatment. Of its cast of characters, perhaps the most untapped is Wolverine (Hugh Jackson), who is practically immortal and indestructible.  He's the most physically capable of the X-Men, the most experienced, and the least likely to die, so you can pretty much drop Wolverine into any plot.  And that's how we've finally arrived at \\"The Wolverine,\\" which is basically Wolverine vs. ninjas.  It's about time.<br /><br />The plot challenge for scriptwriters is his level of power.  Although Wolverine isn't say, Thor or Hulk, he's almost impossible to kill, which means the audience isn't particularly vested in his survival.  This is brought home in the first few minutes of the film when Wolverine survives an atomic blast at Nagasaki. Yashia (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), the officer he saves, propels the plot. Yashida has become CEO of a massive technology corporation, and he sends mutant Yukio (Rila Fukushima) for a deal on his deathbed:  an exchange of Wolverine's immortality to let the old man live and end Logan's torment over the death of his one true love, Jean Grey (a radiant Famke Janssen).  Wolverine turns him down of course, but not before becoming embroiled in Japan's underworld politics over Yashida's estate between ninjas and yakuza with Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) in the middle.  And it's about this point in the film when Wolverine gets \\"de-powered\\" to make things interesting.<br /><br />Wolverine suddenly discovers he's only \\"nigh-invulnerable\\" to use a term from \\"The Tick\\": He can still feel pain even if it doesn't kill him. This amps up the action as Wolverine gets shot, stabbed, sliced, and punched by Yakuza thugs and ninjas in a variety of interesting locations: on rooftops, in trains, and on the rooftops of high-speed trains.  It's thrilling stuff.<br /><br />Unfortunately it can't last.  The Big Bad reveal isn't much of a twist, and the final villain is  a hilariously over-the-top slice of comic cheesiness. It's no coincidence that this shift happens along with Wolverine back to his old self -- which is a shame.  Wolverine just a little weaker makes him that much more interesting.<br /><br />Wolverine isn't a chatty character, and although his sequences with Jean Grey certainly help to give some poignancy to a loner who would otherwise brood silently, there's only so much to work with.  The other characters just circle his orbit, including a badly dubbed Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) whose skintight green cat suit and whack-a-doo powers (she has a poison tongue! a poison kiss! sometimes you die -- but not always!) feels forced in an otherwise tonally Japanese film that's willing to use subtitles for the majority of its dialogue.<br /><br />\\"The Wolverine\\" has claws, but they're not adamantium. It's a step up for \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine,\\" but it's not quite as sharp as \\"X-Men: First Class.\\"  And also...ninjas.ig Bad reveal isn't much of a twist, and the final villain is  a hilariously over-the-top slice of comic cheesiness.

B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|Los Angeles writer Damian Stevenson comes to this project of a thorough examination of the 1983 classic film noir SCARFACE, probably one of Brian de Palma's, Oliver Stone's and Al Pacino's most major contributions to cinema. But the 1983 classic is not the beginning in Stevenson's survey: he goes back to the 1932 Howard Hawks original version with Paul Muni and George Raft which was based on a 1929 novel by Armitage Trail (aka Maurice Coons) loosely based on the character of Al Capone. Stevenson takes us through all the negotiations to bring a new SCARFACE, moving the story to Miami, having the screenplay eventually land in the hands of Oliver Stone and under the direction of Brian De Palma.<br /><br />Damian Stevenson's credentials are exemplary: his books `The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada'  (he is a bonafide expert on Ian Fleming and James Bond) and `Solstice' show his polish and skill as a writer and he gains his inside information of what makes cinema tick through his close association with the likes of Steven Spielberg and the fact that he has written his own screenplays and has been a teacher of writing at the Academy in Beijing, China.<br /><br />But nothing prepares the reader for this enormously entertaining, skillfully dissected and researched volume that once and for all establishes the film SCARFACE as on of the most important matrix references for all gangster films. Page by page we begin to appreciate the dialogue (the source for much of rap music phrases), the motivation of each of the characters to the theme of the film, the `in' arguments and plans that coat the film like a gangster itself, the intricacies of production, the motivation of Al Pacino, the `accidents' of merit in molding the script, and all the information that in another writer's hands would seem like gossip, but in Stevenson's literary style becomes quality documentation.<br /><br />For a thorough look at an important landmark film and a taste of what filmmaking is all about, this easy to read and completely entertaining book is a must.

B008JFUPFI|4.0|I' am a huge fan of Superman reading his comics when I was a kid along with Conan the Barbarian. First what I liked about the film, I thought casting Cavill as Superman they couldn't' t have found a better actor to fit this role. The director and screen writer, editor of this film, I can' t say much about them! These 3 people made this film into another typical action pack super hero movie! Superman is not typical, he represents more than being your regular super hero than the others do!<br /> But that is how he is portrayed in comic books with movies this film I do give it credit by making the film up to date. By his costume and the great sequences of Krypton! The tongue and cheek of past Superman movies you will not find here. This movie takes itself seriously and the director wants you as the viewer to do so too! The biggest complaint is the character development in this film was lost and replaced with more action sequences than dialogue.<br /><br /> For the kids today to know who Superman is they won't by this film! In fact, the violence, religious undertones ( in which Superman is NOT religious)I would be cautious in allowing a child under the age of 10 to view this picture! Watching Cavill is captivating and I will look forward to the second one which I hope they give him more lines to speak than just a couple here and there! Additionally, find another director for this movie is not about a rich man with gadgets but a man from another world who is struggling with inner turmoil of being a man from another planet who is carrying a lot of weight on his shoulders and that weight is to save people in a world he didn't come from but was raised in.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I really loved this take on the fairy tale.  Brilliantly put together.  Special effects are awesome and the story line is captivating.  It is certainly one for my permanent collection.  I really love the opportunity to rent a movie before buying it.  Glad Amazon is providing this service.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this book the reason I like this book because it is very interesting and fun to read I would recommend this book to the whole world
B004SVM7BW|1.0|first of all... a eula? i haven't seen that on any other apps.<br /><br />but... if you're going to subject customers to an eula, make sure it doesn't prevent the app from launching.  tried reinstalling-- crash at eula is reproducible.<br /><br />epic fail.<br /><br />uninstalled.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|get the game<br />it has a lot of flying but its realy cool.<br />its hard to save up coins to get new suits but<br />its fun.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Excellent mix of strong lyrical hooks combined with excellent musicianship.  Best $9.99 I have spent in awhile.  I highly recommend giving this album a listen!
0061950726|4.0|I bought \\"Orphan Train\\" at a bookstore in Maine at which the author was talking about her book.  It's always interesting to get an author's additional input and be able to ask questions.  Christina Baker Kline was encited to share what she had learned about the orphan trains and the children who had ridden them.<br /><br />I enjoyed the way she wrote the story taking two female characters, one a teen and one in her 90's, and turning them into good friends.  I also enjoyed the way she went back and forth between present day and 1929 (and subsequent years) to tell the story.  It all made sense and wasn't at all confusing or difficult to follow.  This book was very quick to read because you wanted so badly for things to get better.<br /><br />The stories of the orphans were so sad.  It makes me appreciate even more my grandparents who were able to take care of their 12 children during the great depression.<br /><br />There was one important thing that happened in the book that never would have happened if I had written it.  I feel strongly that Vivian, as she was called at the time, would not have done as the author wrote.  However, I can't share my feelings further without spoiling too much of the book for those who have not yet read it.  If you want to know what I'm referring to, please write me.<br /><br />Did the book end too soon, or should we have had a little more?  I haven't decided.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Similar to other Dragon-build apps out yet with a different, and more like-able, graphic style. I like how they use missions to encourage uses to visit each other's farms and sort of build up a social interaction with each other, I'd be nice to see them expand on this in future updates.<br /><br />The biggest flaw of the game in my opinion is that it takes a long time to earn money. Even early on near the beginning of the game, You have to save up in order to buy the first basic structures and that sort of takes the fun out of it. It really should be such a chore in order to do something when other apps like it are far easier.<br /><br />Overall, It's not a bad app but once they make it easier to earn money, It will be far more play-able in my opinion.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|After downloading and reloading the game, it wouldn't get past the video in the beginning, which was really cute. I really wanted to play it.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Solid looking graphics, Simple yet enjoyable game-play, and a ton of enemies to go through. The biggest plus, in my opinion, is that there are multiple characters that you can unlock and play as. You can buy upgrades and things of that nature as well. A little bit of a challenge at times but nothing to serious.<br /><br />The only problem I really have with it is that the online does suffer from the occasional lag at times. I think it's mainly because having a ton of enemies on the screen at the same time is just too much to handle and it slows down the game. Other than that, It runs smoothly.<br /><br />Overall, It's a simple yet fun app to play and it's free so why not given it a chance?
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I loved the first season. The characters are complex and intriguing. You may think you know this story but you haven't seen it like this!
B00819ER0Q|5.0|I'm a Jim Carey fan but this is a role that caught me off guard. Not what I expected at all. It's easy to watch for all ages. Highly recommend.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It's the one I always recommend when asked what good books I've read lately.  It's full of magic, wonder and romance.  Beautiful and well written
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Doesn't load. It just won't work. Have tried deleting it and reloading it. It still won't work. My son it's so disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like this game but wish there was other ways to get get more stuff and level up. Also I wish there was a other way to run faster in place u choose.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|This was the set that I was waiting for and it finally become available in Blu-Ray.  Highly recommended to all Pixar fans.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|Love, love, love Disney movies!  Especially the older ones.<br />My son loves them so and especially loves the<br />music.  They are always a good time!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The series is so captivating in presenting the variety of personalities and their loyalty and compassion for each other and protection of the dignity of their citizens, whether an old rascal, a overly proud individual, or a less advantaged person.<br />Their curiosity and &#34;nosiness&#34; was especially captivating. An enlightening glimpse of life in timers past.I am busy enjoying season two.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I like my little pony its pretty cool also another game I recommend is the how to draw my little pony
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Works better/more fully than most FB apps, but glitchy. Usually smooth transition to links, but getting back to FB can be a pain sometimes.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|Love the game<br /><br />Keep u  interesting can't put it down!!!!! Keep up the work on making interesting games. I rate  a 5
0061906220|5.0|This was my first book by Pete the cat, I love this book and I will always purchase Pete the Cat books!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this app. My son asked me to get it, but I find myself playing it more than him.
B001H4NXCK|5.0|A lot of western action coupled with a lot of laughs! Mel Gibson at his finest and Jodie Foster at her funniest!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|After the update, the app was little more than a sitting potato. It freezes on the loading screen on my Kindle fire HD, and it doesn't seem to make any progress.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this bag as part of a deal when I bought my DSLR camera.<br />The bag is big, My wife don't like walking around with that.<br /><br />But I can put the camera, all the lenses I have, the charger, and some other stuff.<br />There is even space for a tripod, which I am thinking to use soon.<br />The compartments are adjustable, and provides protection for whatever in it.<br />If you like to walk around with just one lens, this is not a good option.<br />But if you have alot of stuff, then you can't go wrong with this bag.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It would not load!!  So I never played it.  Looked like fun, but I will never know.  Son-in-Law had it on his phone and would not load either.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Satisfying , if a bit wordy, and interesting.  I believe I got a great deal when buying this app!<br />I definitely recommend it.
B00915G6WQ|3.0|Somewhat slow to get started, the 7th season of Dexter deals with plot points only barely hinted at in previous episodes and unfolds many of the questions that series fans have had very successfully. The psychopathic Dexter Morgan is all but gone but the portrayal has become more interesting and complex. Season 7 also clearly illustrates the divergence of the character as portrayed in the cable series from the Dexter that is portrayed in the books. It almost seems that season 7 is a prelude to the final season of Dexter.<br /><br />Missing from this set are any DVD extras. So if you have any questions about intent of plot lines or production choices, you won't get any answers here.  Too bad. It is why I can only rate this season 3 stars instead of 4 stars.
B001R1DYWW|5.0|Watched this at a friend's request and absolutely loved it!  Great cast and Jim Carrey was great in this role.  Will probably watch it again-
1442359919|5.0|I really enjoyed this audiobook.  Not &#34;over the top&#34; Stephen King, which I thought Under the<br />Dome was..  Good story.  Interesting characters.  I highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game and my 10 & 12 year old got hooked too, which isn't bad because it challenges you brain.
B008RV5K5E|3.0|Delivery was excellent - on time. Only issue is all the special features, previews, interview, etc. the sound didn't work. Main movie was fine though.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but I am sad the series is over, it was a fun diversion!  Wonder what Eric is doing now ....
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is amazing, it lets my play with my friends and lets me comment you have to get it im surprised that its free
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This is a challenging, but relaxing game. Good music and smooth running g on Kindle Fire. The help facility is good and it is fun to play.
B003Y6EL5W|4.0|Normal / Average New York teenager who decides to don a scuba suit and fight crime. Once teen nobody Kicks Ass in the end. Normal appearing little girl (hit girl) turns Bad Ass and Kicks everyone's Ass ! Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage)  - Hit Girls father Kicks Ass and teaches all how to kick ass. Mobster's son can't kick ass, but turns assumes super hero persona and creates a superhero nemesis who needs ass kicked.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This movie was a risk as I hadn't heard anything about it, but after watching it it quickly became one of my most favorite movies of the year.  Great story, acting and powerful message.  It made me want to be a better person and get through tough times.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I got this game a couple of days ago and I already finished it because I couldn't stop play it is so fun. No glitches or problems runs smoothly and doesn't take long to lode again really fun game
B001O6W9QC|1.0|I just did not like it.  Just not my type of movie.  I watched it on a recommendation of a friend.  Not my thing.
1451629184|4.0|It's crazy to read everything she went through. A very strong & brave woman. A very interesting read for sure.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After the months waiting for this book I thought it would be fantastic, but boy was I wrong.. While the first two installments of the Trilogy was great, the writing in the first book was excellent.But in this book it was just a bunch of rambling.  I know that there is another installment of this book, but the road for Ava and Gideon ends here for me. I will not buy the next installlment. Save your money for another Trilogy.
0345803485|5.0|YES.<br /><br />Seriously though, it's horribly written, but the story overall is good, so it's easy to see past that. Makes for a very wild imagination :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Most amazing book I've read so far. John Green is a beautiful and captivating writer. Absolutely incredible and inspiring book
B000S1M9LY|1.0|Biggest waste of ink and paper i have ever read.  That is unless you are a quasi intellectual, then it is right up your alley!!  Author needed to come off his trip before trying to pen this &#34;book&#34;.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book! Would still like to know the cause of the zombies, but will have to deduce on my own
B0086HGW42|5.0|Ed Sheeran is a superb artist. Every song keeps me engaged. The day this man explodes past touring with Taylor Swift will be a great day.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Reviews sounded horrible so I uninstalled it. Didn't seem like hardly anyone liked it. Plus the factyou don<br />t offer the game.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Interesting but predictable after the first &#34;twin.&#34; I decided not to finish the series after about episode 6 (I think 6--it has been a while). Maybe it gets better with each episode I did not see; if so, my apologies.
B00BVYU2P2|5.0|If you're looking for a fun dumb high school show for adults, you've found it!  Funny and smart, but too much sex focus for teens in my opinion.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Why did I wait so long to start watching this show????  Almost done the first season.  Was hooked from first episode.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Probably one of my favorites. Makes me feel like a little kid again. My boyfriend thinks I'm crazy, but its an amazing movie. :)
B00506NRBS|5.0|Derek has written a concise and easy to understand book which contains excellent advice. Likely the best business book I have ever read and all I will ever need to read.
0793563836|4.0|The books are well organized and the CDs that accompany it are very good. I recommend this book to other beginners.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|This is a poor, poor version of youtube and did not meet my expectations. The quality of the videos is close to being good.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|I got this movie for my grand daughter, hoping she'd like it so we can go see Despicable Me 2, which I hear is even better than the first movie. Now that she's watched it a few times, we'll be hitting the theater soon! Great kids movie and lots of laughs.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Big &amp; easy to use, Works great for what I need. I even use it when I balance my checkbook now. Love the big keys!<br />With this free app why would you ever buy a calculator app.
B009WHDFPE|5.0|Now we own every Ice Age DVD out there. And my grand daughter loves them all!  Ice Age 4 introduces some new characters as well as bringing back all the regulars. It's a great kids movie for all ages.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|Born on American soil to Irish parents who return to Ireland during the Great Depression, Frankie is the oldest of 7.  He understands poverty, hunger and death before he's old enough to go to school. As dire as things are, young  Frankie has a  unique and often humorous perspective on the Catholic religion, right and wrong, sex, family dynamics and the overall human condition. What I didn't understand was the title of the book!!!
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|Trying to get a letter to the princess is tough work.  Using 8 different characters, players use each characters special powers to eliminate their opponents and win the favor of the fair princess.  Quick to play and good for kids probably 10 and up.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I enjoy the quicker pace of wit that is more about camaraderie than snark. Most episodes wrap up most of the story without to many &#34;must watch&#34; danglers as well which I prefer. I show should be good enough with one episode to entice you to want more without using the gimmick of making you watch more to see what happened next. It's not BBC Sherlock but it is more enjoyable than I thought it would be. Season two gets a little heavy but i'm still looking forward to season 3.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is such a wonderful series and continues to be in Season 3, however, brace yourself, it is a very tragic season.  Of course, if you have gotten this far, you can't stop now.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I certainly enjoyed playing this game, although I would not mind to have the option to play without hints. Yes sometimes the hints are very useful but even though it would take much longer I would like to figure things out on my own. Over all excellent game.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|it is slow and bogs down a lot<br />post just go away than come back latter<br />and they allow hat speech !!!!
B00062IDCO|5.0|its Voyager, what else can you say. it is season 7 all the cast were in their roles and all the cast perform as expected. the stories are good and the wide screen is even better.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I like it a lot<br />I think it is neat to save stuff I like all in one place<br />and we can share it
0486275590|5.0|That is a perfect adventure novel. It will be hard to find someone who didn't watch the movie. I advise you to read the book because it is more interesting and exciting. This is a must read for teenagers!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|An unlikely favorite. It is deeply moving as the tale progresses and you fall deeper, trying to connect the missing pieces of the story. Makes me tingle with pure reading pleasure every single time.
1451626657|5.0|This is undoubtedly one of the best works I have ever read. The plot of the novel grabs from the very beginning so it's hard to stop till you will not read the book until the end.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Excelent way of keep them. Very good frequency response. For use in studio or operating in stage. The only con is that the earbuds brake frequently.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my kids love this game  very cute  very simple for the 5 year old  lots of laughs with this game
B002BC9YSY|1.0|To all customers of Amazon, beware! There are items, such as this movie, that will not play in the united states. This item will only play in region B ? I was told that Amazon is a world wide company that sells to people all over the world, and that is why products such as this are listed in the united states. But for some reason products such as electronics, are not listed for sale on the web site, that would not play here in the united states. Can you imagine the trouble they'd have if some of the TV's Amazon listed for sale here in the united states, would only work in Europe. I guess it's buyer beware.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|I like pixel games.If you like them you should get this.It's funny too.It has a talking hilarious gnome.And you can fight bosses.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Work like a dream. I'm glad the controller works so nicely. When I get some more money, I'll probably pick up a few more
B00992CF6W|5.0|Survival mode is the best mode minecraft and survival craft are like the same thing<br />Minecraft is awesome there's a computer version of it too!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I want the Xbox version there's 3 versions of it too the pocket edition is what this is<br />Minecraft is like the best game in the world I have a secret world<br />I'm wondering how to get mods and my favorite creeper is the mobs<br />Minecraft pocket edition lite is the worst version ever and the only creeper<br />You get are zombies which are the worst thing<br />Only zombies are cool in the computer version
B007SGM084|5.0|Enjoyed the reading the lives in the series, would like to continue reading from the male's perspective, next time. Recommend
B00459EZLW|5.0|I am in essence reviewing both seasons here.  This Stargate series was as good if not better than the Stargate Atlantis spin off and and better than some of the weak final seasons of the original Stargate.  Once McGiver left the series went down hill.  This series in the Stargate universe was actually very good.  The stories were quite believable.  (Of course they required the suspension of disbelief that all good science fiction requires.)  The characters were believable.  I particularly liked the super loyal top NCO.  He was hard core and your basic Marine hoorah type although I guess he wasn't a Marine.  I found the ending episode dissatisfying only because it left me wanting to see more, and I doubt if it will happen.  It deserves a final movie like Firefly got.
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|The characters were too strange and unrealistic. The plot was so bland. With all the hype the book has received, I expected something thought provoking, but it never was. Green took such a simple sad topic to easily affect his reader's emotions, but even so, I never felt any sadness the whole way through. The characters were so bland, yet bizarre that I never cared about them. I finished the book in hopes of some big opinion altering moment that never came. Wouldn't suggest this to anyone.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|A post-apocalyptic story that gets the job done... amazing scenery blends nicely with the real world. No spoilers but it does have a happy ending. Kind of. ;-)
0375842209|4.0|This book was ordered for a summer reading program for my daughter and she loved it.<br />Thank you for the great service.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Good game New spin on an old classic. Enjoy playing very much. Can only play when you have enough tokens though.
0060825456|4.0|The story line is great but the book is written in a comic form. It would be great to be rewritten as a novel.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|The Devil may have put dinosaurs here, but these guys can still rock the angels right outta heaven! You should definitely purchase AIC's latest.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I like this show. It gives me a good idea about lawyers and how they deal with their cases! Both Harvey & Mick are excellent actors, they did their act perfectly! Sometimes you get bored though because it is the same story every episode, so I do skip some of them sometimes! but highly recommend it!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I bought this for a class I was taking towards my LPC upon the recommendation of my professor. Its a great, thoughtful read, definitely there is a reason there are so many reviews and copies in circulation.
B002NHGG92|1.0|Its so boring! slow story line and characters are not interesting, the story we have seen before nothing new at all! I'll say skip it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My daughter has been hooked on Riordan since she found him, we are currently on a wait for the next book in this series which is due out in November. I have a hard time getting her to read anything else.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|What can I say. I'm 1 of the millions waiting [im]patiently for the continuation of this story. The tv show is wonderful too.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Loved reading the story from a mans totally honest perspective.  Written very well and is most likely the exact way a man thinks.  A great afternoon read!!!  Would love to have more men like \\"Drew\\"!!!
B005HZJ2NY|5.0|It is a classic!<br />How can you say anything other than this is what we grew up on on high school.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|What do I do now? It was such a good book it must be the best he has ever written, therefore, there is no point in reading any of his others? Or do I try others and live with the disappointment. Or might I find he writes this well, and with-in this ambience and milieu, all the time?<br />There is a place between dreaming and wake where true things are told and recognised. Mr Gaiman can express something about these things. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|It is a classic!<br />How can you say anything other than this is what we grew up on on high school.
B0035YDM4Y|5.0|This is an intense and vivid look into the sacrifices that very brave men make in extreme combat situations. This is one of my favorites that I have read in a long time
B000JQU1VS|5.0|It is a classic!<br />How can you say anything other than this is what we grew up on on high school.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Very accurate model and guns are cool this app is cool so get it if your not thinking on getting it do it
B005HJU7HA|5.0|It is a classic!<br />How can you say anything other than this is what we grew up on on high school.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|No soul gets boring right away you just run run run until you die what is the whole point of that! And my mom even hates it she died on it 5times :-(
B003YL4LYI|5.0|What can I say. I'm 1 of the millions waiting [im]patiently for the continuation of this story. The tv show is wonderful too.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Love this app having lots and lots of fun so fun not like that boring game subway surfers this game is much more gunner
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I don't know exactly why I find Harry Hole such a compelling character. He drinks too much and he is a most unhappy man. Yet he is so human and his reactions to people and circumstances with humility and lack of ego draws me to him. I enjoyed The Bat as I have all the other Harry hole books. There is no reason to read them in order but it hels with the continuity of his story.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This product is really great! With different sizes of tips it works great when using it with games. The smallest one works really well when you are playing a game that has small areas that need to be touched. The larger ones work fine with everything else. I had another one with only the one size & playing the games were sometimes very difficult.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I expected a story line better than the one I watched.  The story was all over the place.  I feel this could have been done in another frame of mind.  I love musicals, and this didn't qualify.  I love chick flicks, this didn't qualify.  I'm not really sure how to describe it. I would not recommend this movie.
B004WOH18E|3.0|On receiving an inheritance  from his father, Adam Scott is also left a secret letter which leads him to pursue an interest in the original of a famous painting which in turn contains yet more important secrets which are of  the utmost importance to the Soviet KGB.<br />The search leads Adam, an ex-military man, into a stark conflict with the interests of the Russian secret service who are themselves, to understate, not genteel in their approach towards Adam or his loved ones.  The conflict provides the engine for the murder and mayhem and so, what might be called, the thrill.<br />As usual for Jeffrey Archer there is a plethora of action scenes with the unwitting being bumped off and even Adam's girlfriend meeting her maker prematurely, but what for Adam could have been a matter of honor is an end which, I thought, didn't always justify the means, bearing in mind the number of corpses, including that of his girlfriend, which ensue for the sake of the action and the 'thrill'.<br />Even so, again, the yarn is cunningly woven.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|We have watched this movie many times.  Enjoyed every time as if it were the first.  Very creative, full of adventure and cute all rolled into one. I definitely recommend this movie.
B0013ND30W|5.0|So my goal is to get this film every single time is shall be released. Crazy, I know...but hey...I love this movie so much. At the time when this blu ray was released I did not purchase it due to the fact I did not own a Blu-ray player. I only had bought the DVD version. I went everywhere to fin a copy and finally good thing that Amazon had it for a descent price. I was so pleased because it was delivered to me in a couple of days instead of weeks. It was brand new and sealed with its box cover (which I was seeking for). Get this!
B004UFEJS0|5.0|Our family enjoys watching Ratatouille.  Not that we like rats in our kitchen, but it did make a cute movie to have a rat being interested in being a chef. I recommend this movie.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|It wasn't the interesting because it was a dictionary and dictionary just have definitions nothing interesting that's why I gave it a two
B001DPHDCY|5.0|As a family, we enjoyed it over and over again.  We love having cute movies for our grandchildren to watch.  This is just adorable and teaches a lesson about caring for others.
0525478817|3.0|In the first few pages, as Green described Hazel, I wanted to stop reading. Let's be real, who watches ANTM?! No one does anymore - especially teenage girls. It has become a thing of the past. It's a hit and miss for me. It did a fine job of tugging at heart strings, and in developing the character of Augustus. He felt real, he felt right, and he was the true protagonist of this novel. Hazel was okay, for a character written by a man. It is obvious that he does not know teenage girls, and being one, it is easy to see these flaws and not accept anything but perfect. However, compared to Looking for Alaska, this novel is leaps and bounds better. It is actually realistic, the characters are actually likeable and believable to an extent. The whole Peter Van Houten plot line with his crying secretary needed to go. While reading, I thought \\"Is this real? Did someone give me a fake copy?\\" It was completely unnecessary, and detracted from the plot. However, overall, it was right on the line between good and bearable for me.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|It is the best dj app ever SKRILLEX IS THE BEST MUSIC EVER SO THAT DJ APP IS THE BEST
B005BW0TO4|5.0|I love Three Doors Down. There's nothing else really to say. Name a song of theirs and I love it.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Love the show Castle.  There were some differences but loved the book too.  Castle is a great character!  Easy read!
B005MMYCY6|4.0|I thought, why not. It's free and it's been on my list for a long time. I really liked it, but it was pretty dark and a little raunchy. But hey -- it has Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Natalie Portman, so it's automatically on my 'good' list.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is the best game  I played on  my kindle and much better graphics than dungeon hunter alliance<br />I like  it
1449410243|5.0|Got it for my husband as a cute little peace treaty. He's a cat person and I'm a dog person, so I thought that I'd make peace and get him a cute little kitty book. Not a child's comic for at all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This as is an awesome game love all the cool action in the game. I first started playing temple run and when I found out about subway surfers I just quit playing temple run
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|This installment keeps the action of this franchise going, keep it up Bruce. I don’t know how long you can do these movies but keep going as long as you can!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Writes so you need to read more, difficult to stop reading. My knowledge of Afghanistan changed, but I fell sorry for some of the citizens there.
B003XYE7R2|4.0|I loved this book!<br />It started of a little boring but as I kept reading and reading it got better and better<br />It is a fun and intriguing mystery and I loved the ending<br />I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery book
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Writes so you need to read more, difficult to stop reading. My knowledge of Afghanistan changed, but I fell sorry for some of the citizens there.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|I enjoyed the flick, funny and just enough blood and guts to make the picture an enjoyable ride.  I'm up for a 2nd installment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome and it lets you do more things things that other games don't. it also has great graphics are great.
B00A8MGLAI|3.0|I thought a second viewing would help me find a spot for Cloud Atlas.  Not so much!  Just short of the mark for two great actors!
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|As of this writing, 3 hours with the Pulse.  My setup and sync was flawless with my iPhone 5.  Heart rate has had accurate measurements 2 out of three tries, the first try was a failure... Probably user error.<br />I have Fitbit ONE and Nike FuelBand, will update this review with findings.  Looking forward to this showdown.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This is a great game.  This is the first of this series that I've played.  The graphics are super, storyline is entertaining and games are fun.  I would recommend it to all ages!
B004U8VUQG|4.0|Kind of a grade B movie, but you get drawn in to the plot and subplot. Keeps you guessing who will die next.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|There's too much talking, and some tasks - like the poem and spell - aren't great (they should let you know if you have a line in the correct place). There was an element of challenge that made me want to play to the end. I liked that a lot. Is it worth the $3.00? I'm not sure. I was glad I got it as the free app for the day.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Very engrossing. A fun kind puzzle and visually stimulating.  Hard to stop playing but then all of a sudden there are no more levels left!
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|First off, I liked Star Trek Into Darkness.  I like the cast, the casting of Cumberbatch is brilliant, I really think if they had cast him as Carol Marcus he still would be awesome.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Star Trek, the reveal of who Cumberbatch's character really is should come as NO SURPRISE AT ALL.  That was by no means a brilliant twist.  If they wanted a twist, they should have cast him as Harcourt Fenton Mudd!!!<br /><br />The reveal was kind of a let down.<br /><br />And he's Kahn.<br /><br />As far as movies goes, I enjoyed it.  It was the perfect switch my brain off and just watch to be entertained movie, some are easily ignorable...for one if you care THAT much about the ethnicity of the main villain, you should probably stop hanging around Klan rallies.  Kahn is from the Indian sub-continent, how was that accurately portrayed by the very brilliant but very Mexican actor, Ricardo Montalbahn?  Anyone remember a Mr. John Wayne also portrayed a \\"Kahn?\\"  So as far as race goes: suck it up buttercup.<br /><br />The things I have issues with.<br /><br />Spock, the half human half Vulcan is still quite emotional, honestly is he ever going to learn to control them?<br /><br />There is a role reversal from the end from an earlier movie.  It is setup to parallel its ?predecessor? that for me, it really pulled me out of the movie.  It didn't have that deep emotional resonance of the original at all.  They could have done it better...plus see the last part about the Vulcan.<br /><br />Kirk's ability to command is called into question, again.  Why'd they make him a captain anyway?<br /><br />Honestly, he doesn't listen to his chief engineer about a very major potentially dangerous safety concern?<br /><br />Those issues yanked me out of the movie mentally and yanking me out of a story is a big no-no in my book, so that is why I gave it a 3/5.  The movie is a lot of fun and I recommend that you see it and even buy it if you like it.  If you don't like it, don't buy it.<br /><br />Even with it's 'issues' I still enjoyed it enough that I have to have it.  The parts that work are great, the parts that don't...don't overshadow the parts that do.uy it.<br /><br />Even with it's 'issues' I still enjoyed it enough that I have to have it.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was awesome. It is now one of my fav books to read and i wish they will make another book.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Tells a great story about what so easily could have been a disaster. With all the training these guys do mere mortals don't stand a chance
B005HF0GMA|5.0|Liked the last season so much, I had to see how it began. The characters and stories keep me coming back.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Phillip is a great musician. Watched him all through American Idol perform with original music he wrote. Looking forward to his second CD.
B00CDY6HW6|2.0|An interesting game, but I couldn't figure out how to get started. There were hints using various tools, but the tools didn't show up in the game.
1591396190|4.0|This was a required text for class but I found it very informational and insightful. I will be keeping this text for future reference.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|But I love it too. I will sit down and watch this my daughters and recite the lines with them.
030789701X|5.0|Let's get down to business.<br /><br />You don't buy this book because you need some help navigating through Skyrim and its various DLC. You get this book because it looks AWESOME on a bookshelf. Are you thinking about buying it? Then do it now, because these guides are normally limited runs and if you wait the price will only go up.
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|Love the music and the story line. Highly recommended for all people, men, women or children. The movie brings back some good memories for me.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is one of those &#34;Guy Must Haves.&#34;  Dirt cheap and Absolutely necessary for any Man Cave or handy-man tool box. Nifty little pocket tool can sharpen almost anything.  It may not put a professional finish on a blade but it can easily clean it up.
1250027624|5.0|This book is a must for any Downton Abbey fan.<br /><br />Lavish pictures and a full description of all the characters.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|Martin Freeman is an inspired choice for Bilbo.  Too bad the dwarves all look like rubber and the movie makes Lance Armstrong's doping look like a sip of Gatorade.  How many times can the cast fall down an endless rocky tunnel and survive?  How will Peter Jackson stretch a simple story into three colossal films?  I loved Lord of the Rings, which is an epic story that needed a big treatment, but this is even more over the top than Jackson's King Kong.
B0098460O4|5.0|I believe Jonathan will be one of our all time Tenors.  His voice sails above the choirs and is so strong and precise.  Charlotte is spectacular and together they are wonderful.  If I was to imagine what the angels choir in heaven would be like, this would be it.  This album is a definate spirit lifter and inspirational.  Can't wait for their next one.  PS... they seem to be really nice people as well unpretenious and caring.  A couple of young people to be immulated.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I wish I could get into this game to even rate it.  Can't get past the one screen.  Gives a hint and then just keeps loading.  Tried to uninstall and install again but it still didn't work.  Looked like a fun game too!  :-/
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I am reading this book on my Kindle. I like it because I've enjoyed other books by the same author. I think I'm getting a sense of the Afghan people and think perhaps our government doesn't understand their pride well at all!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I have been working as a nurse for 40yrs. and know that our health care system is broken.  I first saw this film in Gainesville, Florida with many University of Florida Shandes Hospital healthcare workers.  It got a standing ovation.  I've never seen a movie get one of these..  Everything portrayed was accurate and true from the view point of an R.N. and a patient.
1452113432|5.0|I had to purchase The Little Paris Kitchen cookbook after viewing episodes of the TV show on YouTube.  Rachel Khoo is such an inspiration to many of us with small kitchens.  I made the Pistou soup and it was delicious.  I also made the Pistachio Prune and Goat Cheese cake and friends and family enjoyed it.  I'm looking to making some of the dishes as time allows.  I like the fact that the book display french words for foods and cooking utensils plus a list of cheeses, sausage and patisserie cream.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has a desire to prepare simple but tasty French meals.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This was very good and entertaining.  I would highly recommend this for family viewing. It  gives one so much background information about the  sport of horse racing.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is great for kids who love magic and God's I recommend this book for everyone even if you haven't read the first one The Lost Hero.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|My husband watched it twice, in our 48 hour rental period.  I thought it was entertaining.  Therefore I am rating the movie with five stars.
067144901X|5.0|love the little rhymes more for myself than my 12 month old daughter who seems to enjoy flips books more than this.<br />but, it's been a nice addition to her little collection and she enjoys it.<br />recommend it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|First gaiman novel. Won't be the last. Great story, characters and fast paced plot. Couldn't put it down.looking forward to the next one.
1594488843|5.0|very insightful book.<br />gave me a new perspective on motivation and different types of motivation.<br />I do both repetitive mindless work as well as creative work and it helped me understand how to approach these kinds of work differently. That's obvious, of course, but I didn't realize financial incentive can hinder creative work.<br />very thoughtful and insightful book.<br />great read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was my favorite of the three books. I cried through most of it, but loved how the Mockingjay held my attention til the very end.....
0307704076|5.0|great audiobook.<br />listened it to it at least 5 times.<br />Great, timeless advice for anyone.<br />I learned something more each time I listen to it.<br />Recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is a great game. I just wished I could find my other countries. But I play every day and enjoy it.
141694737X|5.0|cute little book.<br />have this book and &#34;Where's The Belly Button?&#34; flip book for my 10 month old daughter.<br />very cute...recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just can't stop playing this game. My only issues is once it updated it deleted my Facebook connection and won't log back in now. I keep getting an error page when I try. And it also deleted my progress for boss battles and now vectors is back.. the tossing the bosses small things back don't always work. They hit me when I try to. Other than that..fun game
B004XMMSZG|2.0|My purchase was delivered quickly, yet a few disappointments. I connected the device to my iHome model: P7 and it did show the blue indicator light but no audio or connection was made between my iHome and the dockBoss air. My second attempt was in my car. I took my apple USB cable and connected them together and connectedit to my car and dead silence even as they were paired, I connected it this way since my stock radio unit does not support the A2DP Bluetooth Profile. In conclusion I will be trying another brand and have to go through the hassle of returning my item to try something else out.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My daughter loves this game.  The graphics are really impressive.  The game resembles Temple Run, so it's pretty easy to figure out.  It takes a while to download, but once the download is done, you're back in business.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I love all Michael items. I love his movies and music. This is another part of my collection that I can treasure.
B008602KQI|5.0|Im not much of a reader and i didnt even know that this movie was based on a series of books.<br />I now want to read the book. I throughly enjoyed the  movie, cant wait to see the sequel :)
B007MDB71O|4.0|The DVD works great. No problems with skipping. The sound is very good. I would buy another one. Good quality.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|I have read about many diets, but this one just \\"rang true\\". It is not only logical and sensible, but so easy to follow. Even my husband who never diets, and is now Type 1 diabetic, has agreed to follow it. I will be following it too, but as I am nearly underweight, I will be careful to not be too harsh on myself. Try it, it gives you a great feeling!
B009369Z8A|5.0|Have watched this over & over.  It's one of my husband's favorites.  Not recommended for children as it's pretty bloody & lots of foul language.
B00821OX98|1.0|I just found it to be very predictable.  Typical cable produced mini series.  Would not pay extra to see it.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I really liked this movie.  Makes you really think about what's important.  Great family film, I gave it to my husband and father for Father's Day.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|I liked the camel club book. I like all of David Baldacci books. would recommend it to everyone. Enjoy the books
B00BZIP31M|5.0|Battle Beast have really come out smoking with this CD. It is a little more 'polished' but the solos are just bada..... Also: Kudos to Noora!  A very good replacement for Nitte. Great job!  She will definitely surprise you.<br />Lotsa cool riffs and searing solos churned out by a finely-tuned metal machine make this CD a must have.<br />It really is an excellent sophomore effort.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|Just got a new computer and this time I purchased McAfee.  I have not had any problems like I had before.
1582701709|5.0|We are using this book for our weekly book club.  It provides many different ways of seeing the world and people.<br />The material in this book is a life-style changer. A great read for anyone who wants to make a positive change in their life.<br />I have the CD, but the book provides much more insite.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|The book was hilarious! It was very funny when Rowley ate the cheese that was laying on the basketball court for almost a year.
0316172324|5.0|I am interested in how the mind works and how we interpret the world around us.<br />This book helped me to make sense of some of my &#34;quick conclusions.&#34;<br />A must read!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is just what I need. Not too complicated but does everything I need it to do. Thanks for a great app!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is one of my favorite games on my kindle. My sister has the same game and we added each other as friends and send each other gifts to help out with money!!!!!
0525478817|1.0|I haven't read such a boring book in a long time. Unrealistic, shallow and thankfully I didn't buy it. Get it from your library and save your money.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Love this game. I could spend hours playing it. In fact I get so wrapped up I forget to eat. It does reliance after a hard day.<br />Ini
B009DCOU9S|4.0|The is very entertaining. The storyline however reminds me of a Monty Python skit minus the comedy. I appreciate the intricate puzzles in lieu of a good story!
B004ELSDZK|2.0|The game is boring and rather repetitive.  It has some amusing graphical elements, but the narrator character gets truly annoying after awhile.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|really like the game but I am stuck on level 37 and cannot get past it.  would recommend it to friends
B002ROKQJM|5.0|I've discovered this book very late, so there's little I can add to the numerous reviews.  Although a Booker  winner, I wasn't expecting to be bowled over.  But I was.  The narrative style is engaging; it felt as if the central character was sitting there actually speaking.  The language is simple, but the content is powerful.  It's filled with vivid imagery which simply reinforces many of the uncomfortable issues raised.  Poverty, cruelty, exploitation and corruption; moral, political and physical...the scope is vast.  The canvas is painted with loud bright colours giving the reader an insight into life in the bright lights of Delhi; starkly contrasting with impoverished village life in 'The Darkness'.<br /><br />There is humour, which works well to relieve the often uncomfortable detail. A careful and fine balance makes the account realistic and compelling.  A great read and if, like me, it's a book you'd not normally look at, I urge you to give it a go.<br /><br />This is a copy of my review on amazon UK.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I had misgivings but this film really deserved the many awards it won!  I am so happy I viewed it and here, so I could re-run it as I pleased. Historically accurate, and beautifully and respectfully done without sacrificing truth. Thanksomuch for this memorable experience.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Very fun game hooked on it Quick. just love it.easy game to learn.Very  kid friendly. Would get it for my grandkids and know they would love it.
B000V8E3C2|5.0|A classic and a favorite - a symphony about America!  It takes a person to those times in Europe, when most had never seen our land and all were amazed and talking about this New World.  Strains from this symphony have been used as noble themes and passion power enhancers for at least a thousand films in the big and small screens. Thank you Dvorak And Wiener Philharmoniker
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Great read.  My niece recommended this series.  I didn't know this series even existed!  Now Im hooked. Castle can really hold your interest with a great balance of humor, excitement, and playfulness.
B000JML7EC|5.0|Another great story it has it all Pirates villians hero's brave boy and a castaway this is a good old fashioned adventure
B008JFUNYG|4.0|I loved the original 1982 film, and when I first saw it on VHS when I was 13, it was in my room and dark at 2am.. I didn't really notice the comic elements until later on. I have a big problem with horror comedies - they suck..and it's why I didn't appreciate Evil Dead 2 as much. Horror is horror..you want to take that ride. Horror comedy is like paying big money to go to a top amusement park, and all you do is either walk around or ride the kiddie rides...<br /><br />That brings me to The Evil Dead 2013 - I really liked it. Exactly what you would expect. Bloodier than I anticipated - especially for a rated film. So some people are yelling, \\"where's the unrated version???\\".. Do you really need one?? This film is way bloody. There was NO way a film like this would have received an R back in the 80's (Reagan era prudishness - Ha!).. Btw, the original 1982 version was Unrated for a reason, and regardless what some sites try and say, the film was NEVER given an R-Rating.. Anyway, I digress..<br /><br />I loved the drug cold turkey twist and how they wouldn't leave in spite of all the wacked out stuff Mia was doing; they kept saying that she was desperate to do anything to leave - even give herself 2nd of 3rd degree burns.. Then when they all realized, \\"we should go\\" - too late..<br /><br />This movie is way better than most people are giving it credit for. Especially when given all the HORRIBLE remakes from the past 15 years..Don't make me name 'em, you know them.. So, so what if the cast and acting make you feel like you're watching something on The CW, and it did lack a certain depth and was light in the character development department. But who cares,the evil IS the main character, and it kept my interest, and for that, I do recommend it for those looking for a good ole late night scare and an 80's remake with actual bite! Unless you liked the remakes of The Fog and Prom Night, then avoid this and please get to bed before sundown.
B000AADYYO|3.0|This album has grown on me a little with repeated listens, but I am still disappointed in it overall. As another reviewer stated, this is far from the intensity of Orchid. I only just now realized that that was their first album; it still stands as one of Opeth's greatest musical achievements, and I really wished that any song on Ghost Reveries could measure up to In Mist She Was Standing. (Nothing could match The Apostle in Triumph.)<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />Among the better songs on this album is the Baying of the Hounds. It has some of that nice raw death growl, and a few excellent riffs and fills. There is some truly great soloing scattered through Ghost Reveries, and I think Opeth's guitarwork shows some progress. But all too often, Mikael opted for his clean voice, which is used well in some places - don't get me wrong - but is completely overdone. Beneath the Mire utilizes his clean vocals very well, and has some sweet lead guitar.<br /><br />Harlequin Forest was the song that led me to buy Ghost Reveries.<br /><br />Hours of Wealth is pretty decent, along the lines of Hope Leaves, if not quite on the same pedestal. That's mainly because of the way the music falls out when it's time for vocals.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />Atonement sucks. I wish I could get my money back for that one, and just replace it with nearly any other pre-Reveries Opeth song.<br /><br />The Grand Conjuration is mediocre. If it were on most of their other albums, it could be let slide, but on this, it sticks out as another straw on an overburdened camel.<br /><br />There was some other song I can't be bothered to find that was purely clean vocals and bad riffs. I hit fast forward to see if it got better, but it didn't.<br /><br />Overall, it may sound as if I endorse this album. A few songs are worth listening to, but on the majority, even the better tracks, they simply milked it too long. I have nothing against long tracks, but some of these riffs just don't fit, just like the vocals and lyrics don't fit; it's like Opeth is trying extra-hard to be \\"Progressive\\" for the sheer hell of it, or to make the wrong people happy, when they used to just flat-out rock.s and lyrics don't fit; it's like Opeth is trying extra-hard to be \\"Progressive\\" for the sheer hell of it, or to make the wrong people happy, when they used to just flat-out rock.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|horribly disappointed with movie, hard to understand and not at all what I expected.  Once again, I will not do another review unless it's incredible as I don't want to type all of these words when just a couple got the point across!
B00821OX98|5.0|I've seen this series on TV the last few months and was kind of curious about it - but I thought I'd be too far behind since it's in its 3rd or 4th season. After I saw it was free on Prime (free is just about right for my price range), I jumped into the first season right away (it's kind of fun to be able to watch episode, after episode and not have to wait a week for the rest of the series!). I'm glad I started it. It's really a very interesting series. It's not campy like Star Trek and it's not convoluted like &#34;Lost.&#34; It's just a really, really good story line that makes you really care about the characters and how they cope with this version of the apocalypse. It is unpredictable and it really catches you. I'm really in to it now, and it's perfect timing since the next season just started. LOVE IT!
B004P4S4NM|5.0|My daughter loved listening to Adele, and I have been listening to Adele more and more. I love this album for my wind down exercises.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I loved all the PSY/Changling stories.  This one is one of the best so far.  Don't get me wrong I love the Changling side of the stories but it was nice to have one purely Psy.  Very well done and I am looking forward to more.<br /><br />My only complaint was the kindle price!!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|Enjoyed this enough to get the sequel. I hope the series continues to entertain. Read Red Shirts from him first, which is backwards, but that's what brought me to this book.
B0093FNZT6|3.0|Very average I found, although I can appreciate the journey I would've liked more imagery around this experience, wouldn't recommend this
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy this game and so do the little kids over all its fun and very time consuming though. You can never beat this game but it's fun when you can compete with your Facebook friends.
B009AP2G26|5.0|It was great to have some different things going in in the lives of the Glee members. It switched things up a bit and made the season interesting. Looking forward to season 5 although Glee will never be the same since Cory's passing.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|Im not sure what happened but I was unable to watch the video at all. I could watch any of the ones I previously downloaded. Just wanted to let someone know.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It works really well but when I entered my location I tried to change it but was unable if someone can tell me how that would be great:)!
B006S01GH2|4.0|it's a decent movie, Amelie is really cute and very different, if you don't mind subtitled movies.  3 more words required
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This has to be the best gameloft has made. Easy to play and its so adicting<br />Wish you could get golden stars faster but its still an awsome game.
B000WEMH3C|3.0|Its fairly light weight, fits well.  I live at altitude with lots of UV so not sure its really worth it to pay for a more expensive one.  I usually take the old one that split and double cover the new one.  That way I get about two years out of a cheap cover.  Webber still looks great underneath it all and we use it more than the propane grill in the Summer.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This book led me to reflect on my work life although it was much earlier, and I mistakenly thought a lot of these problems had been addressed. Led me to make some changes in my life now although I am retired. I would have like a better chronology of her work experience and sometimes, how she actually accomplished what she did was not covered. On the whole, I would recommend it.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|This is always a fun movie for me to watch. Now it's even better with my Blu-ray disc. What a world of difference over the dvd I have. It's like night & day. So glad I got this. It took a while to finally get the price down but it was worth the wait. This is also presented in the 2:35:1 Aspect Ratio which means you see the whole film as the Director intended it to be seen and not some 1:85:1 chopped up version. I can't comment on the Audio as I am currently listening through the tv speakers only. Yeah I know that sucks but what can I do? It sounds good to me anyway & will probably sound much better with the proper system. The Special Features are almost non existent. The only thing you really get is an Aerosmith video: A Trailer: and some Sneak Peaks. These people who put these movies out should be ashamed of themselves for not adding much more features. How sad. Still glad I bought the Blu-ray though.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|By the time I hit the third book, most of the interesting details of their lives have been discovered. I am not interested enough in the grandchildren to want to know what happened.
B00DVXVMT6|5.0|I've been a big Chimaira fan since before their Resurrection album hit.  So, I was very skeptical when the entire band save the vocalist, departed.  What came out of the turmoil and confusion is one of their best albums to date.  Songs like &#34;Plastic Wonderland&#34; show off their technical ability while &#34;Wrapped in Violence&#34; will annihilate your senses with devastating riffs and epic vocals.  I highly recommend purchasing this album as it will most likely climb the ranks of your favorite Chimaira albums.
B00633W614|3.0|I guess it is a way to sell more books but having the ending so abrupt is annoying. It kept my attention but I would not consider it a classic to reread.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a cool and fun game even my daddy likes to play it!! Have only one complaint and that is that the magnet does not pick up the special icons.  I think it should.  **Written by my 10 year old daughter.**
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Exactly what to expect from him:  Lots of fun, adventure, splattering gun wounds and villains getting it from the good guys.

B005VSRFEA|4.0|This book will help to explain the interdependencies of our complex world with clear examples. While it obviously won't give you super-system vision to automatically see systems in the world around you, it does guide your thinking towards asking questions at a higher level of understanding. I definitely would recommend this book to any who want a solid intro to systems.

159463176X|5.0|I love Khaled Hosseini's prose and I was unable to put this book down, but I found myself ultimately unsatisfied.  It was difficult to follow the storyline and I read the whole book with a bit of puzzlement.  I wonder if he first wrote these as short stories, vignettes with characters crossing in and out of the story, and decided to make it a book.  Lyrical and lovely, as a novel, I think it falls short.  That being said, I give him a five just for the look into the psyche of the Afgan people and the beautiful writing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is now my favorite game . I think all of the minions are so cute and adorable, it's so fun. You should try this game , I hope you like we it:):):):)!!!!!!!

B00001IVQT|5.0|This disc couples together two recordings from 1963 when Ashkenazy was an unknown but rapidly rising star pianist and have all the freshness and excitement of a new venture as being experienced by the young Ashkenazy. Despite the quantity of other recordings of these works played by numerous pianists of renown in this field these two recordings are still up there with the very best.<br /><br />The third concerto benefits enormously from the attentive conducting of Fistoulari who had an enviable reputation as a renowned and sympathetic ballet conductor. This skill in being attentive and aware of the requirements and nuances being aimed at by those whom he was accompanying is a clear benefit to this recording and that empathy between soloist and the orchestra as directed by Fistoulari is very evident throughout. Ashkenazy's later recordings with Previn and Haitink may have fuller recorded sound but they cannot match the freshness of this earlier account.<br /><br />The second concerto with the Moscow orchestra under Kondrashin is an equally vibrant affair with plenty of drive and the freshness of a first recording. There are numerous recordings of both works on this disc and it would be foolish to suggest that any of them is a definitive first choice. That said, this disc for many will certainly qualify for the short-list.<br /><br />I note that one reviewer has complained about the lack of bass response in this remastered disc and has compared it with the original LP. This, if true, is a serious allegation of poor product. I am no longer in a position to go back to the original LP of the third concerto,  bought very early on, but I can compare the previous CD version and the improvement is quite clear in the following ways: The immediate gain is one of recorded 'presence' which is very marked. There is also a much wider dynamic range and greater depth of field as regards sound stage.<br /><br />I have paid particular attention to the bass response as that is an area that has been particularly criticised. Listened to casually, it can seem to be a touch bass light. However, listened to more analytically, it becomes clear that what has happened is a general increase of clarity which means that non-musical sounds, especially in the bass, have been removed leaving a clearer, cleaner but apparently lighter bass. This is not the same as less bass but is in fact less 'interference' noise.<br /><br />I would therefore suggest that this 24 bit remastering is in fact very successful and that the two recordings genuinely deserve the description as 'legends.' As such they deserve to be seriously considered by collectors as another alternative reading or as an upgrade from a previous CD issue.ticised.

B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Hypnotic! When it is all over, you may feel you have awakened from an intense dream. You FEEL this season.
B00001IVR0|4.0|This remastered disc couples together the much admired Brahms 2 with Backhaus from 1967 with the much earlier Mozart 27, in mono, from 1955. In both cases the VPO is conducted by Bohm. There is a considerable difference in recorded sound, good for its age though the Mozart is, and this clearly shows the technological leap forward that recording made in the intervening years.<br /><br />On the subject of the recording, this is the new 24 bit remastered version and this has greatly increased the depth of field, the tonal range and the general sense of presence. This is simply because analogue tape recordings contained more information than could be put onto early generation CDs and explains why those CDs were so strongly criticised by owners of high end record players with LPs at that time. The latest 24 bit technology has rectified that issue and that improvement is clear on this disc.<br /><br />The Brahms was the last of three versions that Backhaus made through his life and this one was made at 83 years of age when he still had a further 3 years of performing and recording life ahead of him. It must be immediately stated that his advanced age makes absolutely no apparent difference to his ability to play the music exactly as he sees it without audible technical compromise. Indeed, one of the marvels of this recording is the extreme clarity that he brings to the piano part. This, coupled with sensitive conducting and playing by the VPO, allows a constant flow of musical detail to be exposed and appreciated by listeners without recourse to false recording balances.<br /><br />Essentially Backhaus takes a non-dramatic view of this concerto which allows for much genial playing from the orchestra in a musical partnership. The first movement is taken steadily as is the following allegro appassionato. This is very different from the driven view of Richter for example or the strongly drawn versions of Gilels or Fleisher. This could be seen as somewhat controversial and certainly idiosyncratic as nowhere is there the slightest sign of the 'appassionato' of Brahms' heading. Instead, what we have is something approaching gracefulness and gentility.<br /><br />The final two movements are where this performance really takes off and earns the 'legendary' status. The slow movement is a simply beautiful rendition with solo cello playing plus generally sensitive and sumptuously warm orchestral playing to match piano playing of the same nature. The final movement is all about Viennese charm and grace with a trace of the dance about it. This is truly memorable and matches Brahms' description of 'allegretto grazioso' precisely. In total therefore, a memorable and therefore legendary performance.<br /><br />The concluding Mozart is full of much of the same approach, undemonstrative playing of taste and balance typical of Backhaus. (His Beethoven 4 is really worth searching out on either CD or DVD). However the world has moved on in terms of period understanding and performance as regards Mozart and there are too many features of these performances which, though good on their own terms, are no longer the terms by which we recognise Mozart today. Even a few years later Curzon was more in tune with developing ideas and I would suggest that Perahia or Uchida on CD or Barenboim on Blu-ray from the late 1980's would be safer stylistic and musical choices.<br /><br />I would suggest that this disc is primarily a triumph for the Brahms performance especially, idiosyncratic though it undeniably is. The Mozart will be more of a personal response for those who are not bothered by developments in performing practice over the last 50 years since this recording was made. The 24 bit remastering for both recordings has been markedly successful and lovers of Backhaus' Brahms need not hesitate if considering an upgrade from a previous version.re is there the slightest sign of the 'appassionato' of Brahms' heading.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like this game,it's vary fun. My younger siblings really love it. The only thing in song like is waiting for it to load. But overall it's a great game.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|Truly an amazing book! With a depressing end, but a book as great as that, you learn to ignore the downsides!
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|The Hobbit isn't anywhere near the caliber of The Lord of the Rings. Not even close.  The characters are dull and lifeless, especially Bilbo. (The one saving grace here was Radagast, who *has* a personality.) The music is incessant and way overdone. The Hobbit...the original story, was never very strong to begin with IMO, and the movie follows suit...completely lackluster. I'm so tired of wargs and battles with a bazillion orcs, and please no more would-be kings; such-and-such, son of such-and-such, son of son-of-such-and-such.<br /><br />There was just no magic in this movie, no heart, no depth, no soul.  Peter Jackson really should have stopped with his masterpiece (LOTR).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the series...Season 3 did not let me down!  I love love love this show!!  It makes you feel transported to a different time and place and you really feel for all the characters, even the bad guys sometimes!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is addictive.  Beware!  I just love breeding and hatching the dragons, and building my little park.  It is fun to play with Facebook friends.  It is a free game, but you can spend money to buy &#34;extras&#34; like treats for the dragons, buying special dragons, or buying gems.  For the most part, it is a mindless, relaxing game, but there is a little bit of planning and strategy.  I have it on my Kindle Fire and it is nice to be able to play it anywhere.  You do need to have a WiFi or internet connection to be able to play this game (vs some games that you just download.)
B00009AOBI|4.0|One of my all time favorites, hadn't seen it in years & wanted to share with my teenage daughter! I loved seeing it again too
B004U52VPS|5.0|This game turned out to be fun for all ages.  We have played this several times with both grandparents and grandchildren.  It brings out the kid in all of us.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|It is great to have these available for unlimited streaming on Amazon Prime.  Star Trek The Original Series was way before my time.  However, I love the fact that I can watch classic television on Amazon Prime.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Enjoy the game and re-arranging the living areas.  It takes too long to earn money and they cost of clearing the land is way---over priced
B008GJVH7M|1.0|The horrible story-line is reflective of the adsurd Direction and and is explained by the fact that the story was written by the co-directors.<br /><br />The acting is as shameful the ridiculous story.<br /><br />What a waste of time waiting for this movie to get interesting!
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|Who knew Matt Damon could go from all-American hero to one of the creepiest characters you'll ever cringe away from in a movie.  In fact, most of the characters have a level of loathsomeness that you'll seldom find in a movie.<br /><br />It is hard to imagine that the book upon which the movie is based was the first of a series of five.  The movie's producers paint Mr. Damon into a very tight corner -- and fade to black and the credits.  Chickens!

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Short and sweet- wonderful book that drops you into a mysterious and fantastic world. Well worth the read. I greatly look forward to many new books by Gaiman. If you're interested in reading more by this author I highly recommend American Gods and Good Omens.
B001SZ2Y4G|5.0|Watch and laugh and enjoy a great, great film by the Coen Brothers... one of their very best! A true masterpiece!
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|I found this movie very entertaining, it had action and laughter and I loved the actors. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock will wake you trust me I've tried a lot and I couldn't find the right one. But this one is the best one you will find for your kindle.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was so great. An unusually dark but sympathetic main character and a great plot. Not you everyday read.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Once again a gift for my daughter. She loved the fact that I could have movies sent to her and she didn't have to pay for them.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|I don't understand the people who give this movie about 2 stars. If you didn't think this movie was scary, it's probably because you are evil yourself. Maybe if Lucifer himself jumps through the screen maybe then you will admit it was scary. LOL> So my review is... I was too scared to even look at some of the parts. The story is so good. Usually I am disappointed by scary movies lately but this one is really good.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|My daughter moved away form home so this was a great thing to have delivered to her place before she got her TV cable set up. We all love Big Bang
B005LAIH2M|5.0|Saw this one in the theater and needed to add it to my home collection. Great movie! Would recommend to action/adventure lovers.
B002W7H3EA|4.0|Pretty neat premise with lots of twists and turns.  A bit predictable by today's standards but still a great movie that stands the test of time.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Great family movie! Completely out of the relm of standard holiday movies. Nothing quite like this one. Brings dreams to life.
B008Y6WMEY|4.0|Looks at our political and military approaches (not that we are that different from others) and how badly we can mess it all up.  Classic humor that still lasts.  Had to share this one with my son who laughed through it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini has done it again! He captures you with this book, that is about love, but relatable love, and not all sappy. It took me less than 48 hours to read, as I could not put it down! I'm sad that the book is over. Great read!
B007FKI9G0|4.0|Hysterical review of a dysfunctional rock band convinced that they are on top.  Pay attention - the dialogue is fantastic.  Right up front they tell you that Spinal Tap has risen to become of on Britain's LOUDEST bands.  What a statement!  The settings, the interviews, the interaction, and the commentary throughout the film is all full of laughs.
B007WPLZAK|2.0|I love British period pieces and was looking forward to watching this show. However, I was very disappointed with how shallow the characters seemed. There was more of the war store than love story. Most of the love scenes are the two main characters staring at each other. I felt this show could have been half the length if the staring scenes were removed.<br /><br />This show has very graphic scenes including sex and men blown to pieces on the battlefield.
B0092SQ5EG|3.0|Good coverage of her life history and her life on the road today with a mix of upbeat messages and history.  A different insight that was not disappointing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay is the final book of the hunger games trilogy and let me be the first to say it is amazing!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|it was a good game. i live games like this and it had me on edge until the vety end. i cant wait to play the next one.
0307476073|4.0|It seemed to me she needed a stronger filter in her writing.  She behaved badly and seemed to make her poor decisions a consequence of her mother's death.  Not exactly relevant,  if sad.  She should behave better.
B00CE004XM|5.0|I keep listing to this awesome album over and over and am happy to have found it here. Thank you
B00076ZZ9I|5.0|What's not to love?  AC/DC Back in Black takes me back to the 80's.  Would be nice if the band's name was correct in the description though.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm having so much fun playing this game...challenging and frustrating... in a fun way.  In this high tech world, this game certainly makes you think without the help of an app. I can't wait to play more./
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I absolutely love this app. I think it was worth every penny. I fall asleep listening to it almost every night. I love how you can mix and match so many sounds. The wind chime is one of the best. My only problem with the program, and the reason I give it 4 stars, is that you can't keep the app running while you do other things on your kindle.
1451627297|5.0|I really liked this book. The idea of traveling back into time and changing something in history. What are the consequences ? Would it be easy to do ? I love the fact that the author goes back to the fifties. Nowadays with all the global problems we keep hearing about, day after day, there's probably lots of nostalgia towards this period in recent history. Stephen King describes this period very well, I think. A period in time with lots of beauty, naivety, calmness but also race issues and narrow-mindedness.<br />I liked this book so much that I'm reading it a second time. Having read one of the dark tower books in English, I opted to read this one in my mother tongue as mr King used lots of images and rhetorical figures which aren't easy for a non-English reader. The translation in Dutch was pretty good, even though some figures of speech are difficult to translate.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|found this flick to be surprisingly awesome and i am a seriously critical scifi fan. have reccomended it to many all who love it
B00D8RYV52|3.0|I've been a big fan of nearly all the Dr. Panda games so far but this one is probably the low point in the series. The graphics aren't quite as sharp. There isn't as much variety or creativity in the mini-games. It feels like someone tried to make a poor knock-off of a Dr. Panda Game.
1476734941|5.0|The ultimate diet that doesn't feel like a diet. Lost 9 lbs in 3 weeks, painless!! Highly recommended to anybody, this is a lifestyle rather than a diet in my opinion.
1401902197|5.0|I would recommend this book first to anyone new to Louise Hays philosophy. Its a brief presentation of her book You Can Heal Your Life. Each page is beautifully decorated and her affirmations are listed at the end of each chapter. The artwork is beautiful and it is bound in great quality. This is still my favorite one to go back and read often to keep my mind tuned when life gets busy. A great one to keep on the back of the toilet!
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|My 4 y.o. son loves to see me driving myself crazy as the levels get more difficult.  Didn't know what to expect and received more than I bargained for.  A few more levels left and will see what's in store next.
0783225482|5.0|omg! Sooooo funny! This will always be one of my favorites no matter how they improve on technology! Yes, the technology is a little weird, but it was made in the 90s- so its good for its time. Extremely creative and hilariously funny- this one will always leave a smile on your face when it comes to mind!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I read this book for a few reasons. My girlfriend was telling another friend about it as I was driving them to visit the Betty Ford Gardens in the mountains of Vail, CO. The listening friend wanted to read it because her grandmother adopted a 1 year old off the orphan train. Fortuitously she learned of this rich  literary novel. I wanted to read it because God is helping me heal my relationship with my daughter who I left behind. It is a wonderful account of how things aren't over until they are -even when we think the are. Loved the ending.
B000EZ7ZYA|5.0|Guys- you want to know what a good girl wants, watch this movie! Besides being hilariously funny and inspiring, it definitely helps guys to understand what a girl is looking for in a mate. 5 thumbs up!
B005DOKIYG|3.0|Did not like that it is zipper but only halfway around so have to remove from case to use Kindle.  Leather nice
B00AW0KGYI|3.0|After ordering this, I seen the whole deleted scenes part on youtube!<br />its really not worth buying at all! but i love twilight!
B00AIBZLVY|3.0|I'd rate it 2 and 3/4 rounded up to 3. I think I'll view it again to make sure I'm evaluating fairly, but first impression, pretty basic.  Strength was the actors, who all did a good job.  It's an angry poltergeist story, similar to other popular ghost film stories of the last 30 years, nothing really new or unique; being middle age and seeing so many of these films (I like horror) after about mid-way through first act (when the girls are initially rescued), I fast forwarded to the end; something about the set up of the rescue didn't appeal to me, perhaps just cause it was two guys entering a creepy house and I've seen that so many times before.  I like horror but I don't like being startled; after viewing 3rd act, and returning to beginning of film, I found story predestrian (did I spell that right?), but not awful. Though it is average and told in a traditional manner, if you like the genre you might enjoy it.
B0098JJYZQ|4.0|A very satisfying sequel to Gabriel's Inferno. Once again I found I couldn't put the book down, completely drawn in to the story of Gabriel and Julia. This book takes a very introspective look at both of the lovers and traces the emotional journey of them growing enough to be able to make their relationship and love work. The story is told with Mr Reynard's lyrical prose and subtle humour combining to create a rather poetic book. Although, I will admit that the word 'parenthetically' was not used nearly enough for my liking. It was used once. Once! Sad under-representation of a marvellous word.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Gabriel's Rapture and was pleased to find that music once again plays an important part in this story. I will be adding a 'Gabriel playlist' to my iPod and Grooveshark accounts very soon.
140006922X|4.0|ASLAN'S ZEALOT IS A WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION TO THE LIFE OF JESUS FOR THE BELIEVER AND NON-BELIEVER ALIKE. I LIKED THE STORY LIKE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED AND WITH THE NOTES AND EXTENSIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY A DEPTH OF SCHOLARSHIP WAS ALSO SHOWN. AS A TEACHER OF SCRIPTURE I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO MY STUDENTS WITHOUT RESERVE. WHO COULD NOT RESPECT BOTH JESUS AND REZA AFTER SUCH A READ?
0316228532|5.0|Oh this book! I know many people did not like it or perhaps expected something different. Having heard all the hype before reading the book I went into it with an open mind, expecting nothing familiar.<br /><br />This book is real and dark. There are no happy endings, or puppies or fairy dust. It's difficult to read at times. JK Rowling writes people so well. These are people you've met before and have not liked very much. To be honest, the only really worthwhile character is dead. Although there are one or two characters who you find yourself rooting for, generally this is not the cream of humanity. But then again, they are just everyday people. And people are not very nice.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It's real life at it's grittiest and having a box of tissues nearby might be a good idea.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I truly loved the old version, New is not always better, in my case I do not like he New version at all, I am having the same problem with losing battery  issues. Looking for more APP!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I went ahead and downloaded this game on a whim. Boy, was I surprised! This game is fast paced, enjoyable and just all out fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys social gaming and UNO. It's just as fun as the physical game itself. Being a pessimist about electronic games, I must say it was refreshing to be wrong. Try this one, you won't be disappointed.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|if you haven't seen the first 6 seasons, won't be quite as rich but still pretty bloody. Delivery was easy and painless.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Only found Lana on youtube by accident. A few songs in and a mad girl crush is in full swing! Love the AutoRip, I can bring her with me anywhere.
B0054SMID0|3.0|The story &#34;lost it's punch&#34; toward the end - almost like the author tried to get it over with.  Besides, the title is a bit misleading.  John

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I look forward to season 4. This is a great television import. Well written, Superb acting, and still a roller coaster to watch
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Took forever to download, then would not open! Shut the Kindle down totally then<br />brought it back up. No Luck! After the third try, shucked it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The only negative criticism that I can think of for this novel, is that it ended.  I was drawn in on the first page and wanted more when it was over.  I woke up early to finish reading it last weekend, and after twenty minutes of reading, I had to stop because I was crying so hard that I could not see to read the print on my Kindle.  The characters that he creates are people that I would like to know.  Their pain, disappointments, losses, joys and loves are portrayed in such a beautifully written style that I just want to cherish every word, page and chapter.  I will probably wait a few years and read this one again!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|great game. Whole family loves it and the graphics are great. Not giving 5 stars because it wont pass the looading screen after the update.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|I love this book so many stories if u are as much as a book worm as me u will LOVE it:)  my favorit story was 8 cousins. Thanks a lot!

140006922X|5.0|I am an undergraduate religion major that has taken several classes in biblical history and theology, a future seminarian, and an amateur reader of theology.<br /><br />I'll preface by stating the obvious; the criticisms that this is a muslim take on Christ are wholly false, and upon inspection of the notes in the back (I wish there were footnotes), this is a well researched document, drawing most of its inspiration from modern heavyweight Christian theologians. Anyone that tries to smear this book on the grounds of Reza Aslan's religious background did not read the book or could not understand its contents.<br /><br />I can't add an educated critique that would stack up to many other reviews on this page since I am really only an enthusiast and budding scholar at this point. However, as a layperson reader, to whom I think the book is addressed, the book reads wonderfully and had me glued to the pages until I finished it. Aslan is humble and warm in his presentation of his evidence, and never tramps upon matters of faith. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Jesus that wouldn't be turned off by their own close-minded fundamentalism or dogmatic atheism. It was a joy to read, and was not too long at that.<br /><br />I'm thankful for Reza Aslan and his publication of this excellent read!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is one of those books that I don't think was written particularly well, but I could not put down.  I HAD to find out what happened to these two.  This is a great story about a young couple no longer in love and the sudden disappearance of the wife.  This is certainly worth a read and I believe they are making a movie...
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I had first received an E7K amplifier which has all the bells and whistles as well as it's own DAC (digital analogue converter - to hear a digital recording you must convert back to analogue to hear it). I love this unit and will be writing a review of this as well.<br />When I received the FiiO E6 I noticed that it was encased in a light plastic. I was not expecting very much. I hooked it up to a iPod as well as a laptop to measure each quality experience separately. I found the laptop (has Beats Audio but never sounded good to me through headphones) and the iPod both sounded surprisingly excellent. I have used other makes of amplifiers but was never impressed like I was with FiiO E6. I just can not believe how good this device is. If you like the idea of a more massive and expensive amplifier with it's own DAC unit I can not  fault the E7K; however, truth be known the E6 I am reviewing is all the amp most people needs. The quality difference is not going to make one upset if they chose this modest priced unit.<br />I do want to make AN IMPORTANT STATEMENT about this amplifier. It contains a VOLUME CONTROL which you may forget it is there since the touch bar is very stealthy. A strip of metallic plastic which is so smooth you may begin to view it as just a nonfunctional design. Here is where the issue might develop. Several days ago when turning the device on to the sound selection (I like blue light) I had inadvertently touched the metal strip and had UNKNOWINGLY TURNED DOWN THE VOLUME. After I attempted to recharge the device I decided the device had failed so I then emailed for a return ticket. Out of concern that I did not have all the packaging material I then attempted to try the unit again. I inadvertently correctly turned up the volume - Oh yeah that what the silver strip is - now I remember reading about this in the instruction book! Embarrassing but you can understand when you get yours - then again maybe not because you know now what to do. TO ALL THE REVIEWERS PANNING THIS PRODUCT, IF THE PRODUCT IS NOT A FAKE YOUR PROBABLY ACCIDENTALLY TURNING DOWN VOLUME AND LEAVING IT DOWN.<br />Yes this is a good buy even if you opt for the more elaborate unit. Many people will say that this unit is just fine and that anything larger in size maybe unnecessary. Truth be known you may very well be happy with just this device. If your not sure which one you want then go ahead and buy the more expensive E7K and modest priced E6. If your like me you will like both devices.
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|At long last, \\"Scarface\\" receives the serious treatment it deserves. Thanks to the meticulous research and creative mind of screenwriter and novelist Damian Stevenson fans now have an bible for the 1983 De Palma movie. Good movie books are rare.<br />There is one other book on \\"Scarface\\" (\\"Scarface Nation\\" By Ken Tucker) but it is riddled with errors and is superficial. \\"Scarface: The Ultimate Guide\\" is a detailed and intelligent examination of the movie from its inception to release - and beyond. The book feels fresh and is a great, fun and informative read. No doubt the release of this incredibly detailed, authoritative book is timed to the movie's 30th anniversary this year.<br />I have seen `Scarface' countless times and thought I knew everything about it but I learned a lot from this book. At times the information was a little overwhelming. I'm not sure if people care too much about camera angles or the references to `Star Wars' but at least the writer keeps the technical aspects to a minimum. The book's best part is the shot by shot (or close) analysis of the film. It's like seeing the movie through a new set of eyes. I had no idea De Palma's film was so layered.<br />The facts that struck me that I wasn't aware of before: how similar the movie is to the original 1932 film (especially so much of the dialogue!); how the shoot had to leave Miami because of protests about the script's treatment of Cubans; how the style of the film influenced the look of \\"Miami Vice;\\" the movie's strange antisemitism; the power of the music and how it is used; how De Palma uses the camera to enhance scenes; and all the trivia that is packed into this short but brilliant book!
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|Was an ok movie. Graphic's were good and fun to look at but the story was very poor. I know you can't ask for much on a child's classic story with an adult take on it, but it was just bland overall.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|Complex and captivating, the first book of the Game of Thrones series quickly enveloped me in its plot. There were many voices to learn to love or hate and it seemed like just when I thought I'd figured out a character, Martin threw in a twist. Throughout this tale filled with adventure, the exotic, and a hope for honor, I enjoyed watching the players grow as individuals. This was certainly unexpected and the sign of a great story-teller as he wove their personal triumphs into the larger tapestry of the tale.<br />The cliff-hanger ending left me wanting...NEEDING to read the next. Always a good sign!

B0016YBFZ8|5.0|One of the best gangster films of all time.  I saw this movie for the first time during the fall of 1991 with some buddies and we all fell in love with the story, the characters, and the music.  I really think that the music helps to tell the story of how the mafia lifestyle changed from the 50's through the 80's.  I find myself watching this movie 5 or 6 times each year.  It's a classic.

1451624468|4.0|I loved making it through this book, but I have to admit that I couldn't follow much of the physics described by Lawrence Krauss. I am scientifically trained, but my own field was biology and more specifically neuroscience and physiology, with a little bit of biochemistry. My physics is very much limited to the basics covered by first year university science programs (from nearly 30 years ago)!<br />Having said that, I feel that if I persisted - probably by re-reading the book a few more times and/or following up some of the fundamentals from other sources (I reckon Wikipedia would suffice!) - I would probably appreciate the material a lot better. However it is certainly straightforward enough to follow the key points, such as the flat, eternal expansion of the universe, dark energy and cosmic background radiation, that the total energy of the universe is zero, and the outrageous but statistically balanced properties of virtual particles (see Ch 10: Nothing is Unstable).<br /><br />One of the excellent features of Krauss' coverage is that it is very much an outlined history of the major discoveries in cosmology and particle physics over the past century or so and their significance to our existing understanding of physics on the sub-atomic and the whole-of-universe scales. Credit is paid to the vast array of famous and not-so-famous physicists that have made the important contributions to the field. The material is all presented honestly, from the ground breaking findings that are not in dispute, to false paths that some researchers have taken in their quests for the truth, as well as the poorly-understood and even highly-speculative fields such as string theory.<br /><br />However, it really isn't necessary for the reader to follow precisely every description of every important discovery in cosmology or quantum mechanics in order to appreciate the circumstances of the origin of the universe. The physics basis is critical to the conclusions, of course, but the most important implications come out in Krauss' final chapters and the Epilogue. A distinction between science and theology that is highlighted here (and indeed, throughout the book), is that scientists don't claim to know all the answers. The very fact that we don't know it all is indeed the main driver for further exploration and experimentation:<br />\\"...That is why we have science. We may supplement this understanding with reflection and call that philosophy. But only via continuing to probe every nook and cranny of the universe that is accessible to us will we truly build a useful appreciation of our own place in the cosmos.\\"<br />In contrast are \\"...those who have decided in advance [...] that the supernatural (i.e., God) must exist so they define their philosophical ideas (once again completely divorced from any empirical basis) to exclude anything but the possibility of a god.\\"<br /><br />Furthermore, Krauss doesn't need to get bogged down in esoteric metaphysics. All he does is highlight a few salient points and questions about our origins, and whether there really is any need for God in our rationalisation for existence. The philosophical discussion has now been pushed back, to beyond whether 'something can come from nothing' by virtue of rational, physical, natural causes, because we now know that it definitely can. Instead the metaphysical ponderings are now about the laws of physics, and the question apparently first highlighted by Albert Einstein. To paraphrase: \\"did God have any choice in the creation of the universe?\\". Or more specifically now, did God have any choice in the laws of physics? (\\"God\\", in this context, can be taken as the omnipotent deity if you're theistically inclined, or as Einstein and Krauss would contend, simply the profound nature of all reality that doesn't require intelligence, morals, or any other anthropomorphised attributes.)<br /><br />Despite what theologians might have to say on this matter, no one yet has the answer to this question (was there any 'choice' in the laws of physics for our universe), including Lawrence Krauss. Importantly, the question is a human one, and while we can 'supplement our understanding' of it with philosophy, the most robust approaches we have to address it, as well as any other question of relevance to humanity, are those of scientific enquiry.uestion (was there any 'choice' in the laws of physics for our universe), including Lawrence Krauss.

B00DJWV11I|4.0|A light-hearted, easy and funny read about the taming of the man whore, Drew. The characters were all easy to like and I particularly liked that Emily was not a pushover despite her attraction to Drew.  Their verbal banter was entertaining. I also liked Drew's family and his adorable niece.

B005S9ELVC|2.0|Gangster Squad was one of those movies that didn't generate a lot of buzz on the movie circuit but had me all hyped up anyway. With a cool premise and all-star studded cast, coupled with the fact that it's supposed to be inspired by true events (a story I'm vaguely familiar with), I figured I was in it for the win. God, I hate it when I'm wrong! Movies that are \\"inspired by true events\\" should always be followed by a disclaimer that it will play fast and loose with both the historical accuracy and details of the actual story. In all fairness, I really should've should known better.<br /><br />Basically, Gangster Squad is one of those movies that talks the talk but it doesn't walk the walkIt's superficial in that it looks the part but in no way can it run with the big boys. It's all bark and no bite, see. I think you get the point. It actually reminded me a lot of my recent Great Gatsby experience in that the focus seems to be more on the outer surface than the inner core. There's no arguing that it's a beauty to look at --- it's slick and stylised with a neo-noir sort of feel---but the violence is cartoonish, the dialogue hollow and the characters are all parodies of what mobsters and cops should be.<br /><br />And I think that's the thing that surprised me most. We have this amazingly talented cast, yet no one really manages to break out of their stock gangster stereotype. It felt like they were all fighting eachother for the spotlight and the result was that not one of them managed to shine. I guess you really can't do much with a bland character thanks, in part, to poor development and writing. I'd also like to note that the Sean Penn - Emma Stone coupling really creeped me out here. Just... gross. And while we're on the subject of Sean Penn (and his character)--- he's too much. There's too much drama, too much make-up, too much of everything. Sean Penn was way over-the-top with his characterisation of Cohen and hecame off comical, not dangerous. Essentially, he was the embodiment of every stereotypical villainous trait you could think of. Controlling over his woman. Oh yeah. Former boxing champ. Yep. Maniacal laughter. Yep. Cheesy bad-guy quips. Yep. Inefficient henchmen. You betcha. It was near impossible to take him seriously! Even Gosling, who is apparently super choosy about his roles, was less than impressive. Well, as less than impressive as a specimen such as himself can possibly be.<br /><br />This is one of those films you've seen before, only everyone else did it better. Don't let your expectations get the best of you like they did with me. While it's all wrapped up in shiny and pretty packaging, it's totally lacking where it counts the most. Very few movies can pull off being so high on action and artfully shot (i.e. - Drive). Gangster Squad is shooting blanks.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Gangster Squad is a movie loaded with promise and potential but, unfortunately, it fails in the execution. While it's an aesthetically pleasing film to watch, it's predictible. The dialogue borders on cheesy, the characters read as inauthentic and hollow and the villainy is too over-the-top. It's a real shame, given the talent, that no one manages to break the mold. This movie, overall, is unsubstantial and wholly unsatisfying and that makes me sad.was the embodiment of every stereotypical villainous trait you could think of. Controlling over his woman. Oh yeah.

B005ZI2ZUK|4.0|OVER THE FENCE is a short rhyming tale about how curiosity can get the best of people. Although the meter is a bit off, the story is cute for young children.
B008N9AAQ4|4.0|There is no narration or text labels of what your seeing. (The musical soundtrack is exceptional, and an integral part of the film.) Without an explanation of what is on screen, I found the movie confusing, but fascinating. Afterwards, I watched all the special features (48 minutes total). OHHHHH! Now I understand the motivations for the images, and why there are no explanations. This is a rare exception: watching the special features BEFORE the film will make the experience more enjoyable.
B0053EZXRS|1.0|The audio quality was terrible. I could not hear anything even with strong speakers connected. I even did not finish the movie.
B00D6QUJ6U|4.0|I've owned the regular dvd for many years.  This a a great concert from begining to end.  Great songs and great performances.<br />When the blu ray came out, I really wanted it for the improved picture and sound, although the dvd wasn't bad at all.<br />The truth is, there's not a lot of difference in quality between the two.  The upscaled dvd looks and sounds just about the same as blu ray.<br />So this concert experience to me was that it still is one of the very best concerts around, but don't waste your money on the blu ray!  Either way, you can't lose.<br />One more problem with the blu ray disc. The menu says there are subtitles in English and other languages.  I like that because I can't always makes out the exact lyrics on any music video.<br />So I select English and there is nothing.  I used the remove on my player and it says none.<br />Maybe it's for the short special features only, but it should have said so.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I only purchased the CD because it came with a free digital album but great band and great CD. .
B00CJGP116|5.0|Another amazing album from Marc Anthony!  He is back doing what he loves the most, salsa, his voice is incredible and the selection of songs is wonderful. I love every single one but my favorites are Volver A Comenzar, La Copa Rota, Espera, Flor Palida.  I am a huge fan of Marc's and have loved all his previous work especially Valio La Pena and Iconos but this album truly reflects his present state of mind both personally and artistically.  It represents what Marc called his new self,it is his most personal and deepest work so far.  But he is still the same perfectionist, the true artist for whom music \\"has to come from a pure place\\" (his words) and who doesn't compromise his high standards and principles for commercial success. When one listens to the songs, one can hear the joy in Marc's voice, he is in a great place in his life and career now.  I can't wait to see him perform the new songs at his tour, I already got my ticket!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is one of my favorites.  It's written in the unorthodox style of the oral history and does an excellent job of a) weaving together seemingly disparate narratives to tell a great story and b) creating a complete and consistent speculative fiction world.  Both are impressive feats.

B00E0S52K6|5.0|I've always liked that Guy Buddy and this is his finest hour in a long time.  Relaxed, brilliant blues top to bottom.  My favorites are I Go By Feel and What's up with that woman? But there aren't any weak cuts to my mind.  Fresh, hard driving blues and he's 76? Just an incredible blues musician.  I got hooked on the blues with this style when I saw Lonnie Brooks in a shed in southern Illinois one evening in the 80s.  Buddy Guy is the Godfather of this hard driving heavy blues style.  He's the best there is.  It would be a dream concert to see Lonnie Brooks open up for Buddy sometime...

B00CH87HF4|1.0|Free to play, sure.  But to get anything will cost you.  And cost you LOTS!  1 healing potion = 20 gems.  200 gems = $2.00.<br /><br />Not to mention all the gear and junk you need to buy to not die.  This is as insulting and shameful as those emails you get asking you to help a rich guy get his money and all you need to do is give him some of your first.<br /><br />RUN!  FLEE!!!!<br /><br />The game play is lame and boring too.  Loot is practically non-exsistant.  My next weapon to buy cost 20,000 gold.  How much do i find killing baddies?  1-5.  Yeah.  The developers/publishers can go to hell.

Charlaine Harris is way defensive of all the bad reviews, but really what did she expect? She disappointed and let down millions of fans. Oh, it's her \\"artistic\\" vision (rolls eyes). Let's disregard the fans of the series for the sake of \\"artistic\\" vision. No vision there. Just boredom and bad, lazy writing.

0142001104|4.0|As someone who came from nothing and is now living pretty much a dream life, I found this book spot on.  Mr. Zander has an interesting, artistic perspective on possibility.  I enjoyed his take on it.  Life truly is a creation, and all the pain and suffering is also a creative mythology, if you take it that way.  One of my mentors (who has taken her kids to Italian Switzerland for the month since it costs as much as camp, lol) taught me long ago that everything-every endeavor and every breath is creative.  It is truly what we create and focus on that becomes in life.  These days I am so grateful for everything, all of it.  Possibility starts within.

Certainly more then red box, even when you're a few days late. But it costs more? Someone is greedy. Either the studio or Amazon.  And why no HD when streaming in a browser? Only on a Kindle or XBox? Even Netflix streams 720p. Makes no sense.<br /><br />Just wasn't worth it. And btw, the movie was pretty ho hum. Had no issues with the first GI Joe, but aside from a few clever action scenes this one is just anti-exciting. Ho hum acting. Ho hum direction. Wait for it on Netflix unless your just totally jonesing for something new and too lazy to go to a red box.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|This movie is a great addition and must have to your Underworld collection! I never thought this movie was going to be made since it was 6 years since Underworld Evolution came out. Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009) seemed like just a filler movie that was probably the weakest of the 4 movies and a prequel. Kate Beckinsale looks great in Underworld Awakening and hasn't aged a bit; a little of that might be the make-up but she is still very beautiful at 40. I won't give out too much details for those who haven't seen this movie yet, but the ending makes it open for a 5th installment. I hope they make another Underworld movie to finish off the story line but only if Kate reprises her Selene role and have Len Wiseman either direct or write the story for it.<br /><br />The Bluray quality is excellent! There are rich blacks which is important since most of the film has night time scenes. There isn't any noticeable grain. I was not able to watch it with full surround sound as I can't crank up the volume where I live.<br /><br />I hope they never make a reboot of this franchise though because it was already done right and I can't imagine anyone else playing Selene! Who knows what studios will do though 10 to 15 years from now.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There has been a lot of criticism of this book. I suspect it's from the same people who claim to like artsy-fartsy films and disdain popular blockbusters. Those people should obviously stay away from this book (as they should from popular movies), but why pan it for those of us who love this sort of thing?!?  It's not written any more poorly than most popular best-selling novels; so I really do not understand the vast bitching about &#34;poor writing&#34;.<br /><br />Basically, this book and, I assume, the following two, create a fantasy universe that (most) women would love to inhabit:  gorgeous, sophisticated, billionaire lover who is totally in love with the heroine!  I can totally see the attraction.  (Actually, I wish I could meet a guy like that!)  Furthermore, E L James describes perfectly the feelings and emotions that accompany a budding relationship.<br /><br />Too much emphasis has been placed on the erotic aspect of the book, and not enough on the love story.  There are plot and character development, good descriptions, and a good suspenseful pace.  There is also kinky sex, but not to the exclusion of the other elements above.  By the end of the book, you are totally immersed in James' universe and cannot wait to read more.<br /><br />In summary, if you are a prude or a literary snob, stay away from this book.  If, on the other hand, you enjoy a good fantasy, by all means read this book.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved the descriptive way he teaches me about that part of the world.  A place that I will never see but now I think I understand a little more about the people who live there.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son just loves this game.  I've tried to play it and it is a very face paced game. I was very surprised to see that my son caught on so fast.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Every episode from the pilot onward sucks you in so you are always thinking just one more. The character development and interaction just gets better with time.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it made me feel as though I don't have to conform to society's ideals of the extrovert. I feel more comfortable in my own skin because of the ideas in this book. Well researched and interesting. Thank you Susan Cain :)
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Ice Age is one my favorite movies to watch, when I'm bummed out  Iike to watch Dawn of the Dinosaurs to make me laugh at Deiago when he chasing that deer(?) and gets out of breath, and the deer says &#34;I'm on my tippy toes&#34; lol
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I really enjoyed this story so much that I couldn't put it down.  The journey of the self can be thwarted with troubles.  But finding our true self and living a life full of passion and meaning while remaining true to our real selves is the greatest life a person can live.  Learning to listen to our conscience and follow it's lead is important and can offer great value to our sense of meaning in the way we live our lives.  I really enjoyed this book.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to love this app but since the last update it is practically unusable. What a mess.  Please fix and bring back old format.
B00BU18U82|5.0|When the game is new it's not very good, but as well, when you get further in it it becomes worth way more fun.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|This was a great movie.  Unexpected, unique and fun.  Sadly, like with most Amazon VOD, there's no captioning.  This doesn't reflect badly on the movie, of course, but more so about Amazons reluctance to provide a service to the handicapped.
B00CISC244|4.0|I got this album from listening to one of the songs from youtube.  Im pleased to add to my collection of records
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like this game. It is  so funny. I don't like this game cause I can't seem to pass the leval I'm on
0684853523|5.0|A prefect book for some one who is still swiming in the desitions and new feelings that becoming a writer arouse in ones self. Your reality and your most secret pieves may be others best topic to read... step inside.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|This game is the best and a good way to teach future pilots a little about flying :)<br />I some times get mad when I get to far from my friend and I fail the mission :( but it's user error nothing to do with game.I tried getting next to him,it worked the hard part was not trying to get to far ahead or he won't be able to catch up and you will lose site of him.oh there is also people shooting at you when it happens try to tilt a move left,right,down,and up a little to miss the bullets,good luck
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is a great city game for anyone of all ages. Also it is extremely fun and super-super addicting to play.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|It is a great game but it needs more to do without paying the ridiculous cost of $10.00! Make 2 more planes free.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|So many 3D movies are filmed in 2D and then have a few 3D tricks added after the fact. Watching Avatar was a pleasant surprise, knowing that it was actually filmed in 3D. There is a noticeable, significant difference in quality which sets it apart from other so-called 3D films.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I really enjoyed reading The Host, written by Stephanie Meyer.  I'm am a Twilight Saga fan and was not disappointed by this book.  I think the movie was done very nicely and tastefully, no swearing, no nudity.  Good job!
030771652X|4.0|Sister by Rosamund Lupton was an intriguing novel that contained all of the elements of a great mystery, a questionable death, a loving sister who wouldn't give up on the truth, and a suspicious cast of characters. Despite all evidence pointing to suicide, Bea, knowing her sister, Tess, better than anyone, intensely probed into what she believed was her sister's murder. Additionally, Tess was single and pregnant with complications in both her personal life and with her pregnancy.<br /><br />I had only one difficulty with the book; it was written somewhat confusingly. Bea was the narrator of the novel, but at times, she revealed her story while providing a witness statement and recounting the facts of what she uncovered. At other times, Bea switched to addressing her sister, Tess, who she spoke to throughout the novel. Sometimes the change took place within the same paragraph. It became distracting.<br /><br />That being said, I was thoroughly engaged throughout and kept guessing until the very brilliant ending. I would have given a 4 1/2 star rating if given the option.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|I read the book and loved it, so I just HAD to see the movie.  I was surprised at the differences between the book and the movie.  I really liked the movie but couldn't understand why they changed so many details in the movie.  The movie was VERY good but just different.  I enjoyed them both.
0743270754|5.0|This is a great book about Lincoln, albeit a little long.  So, I'm only part way through it.  I'd recommend it to any American history buff.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Reliable product. I use it at least three times per week and it has not let me down yet. best part its free
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I was disappointed in a large part of this book because I thought America spent most of the book being fickle over her feelings for Maxon and Aspen. Back and forth, back and forth and it was annoying. However, I enjoyed the first book so much that I kept reading. At the 70% mark, I was glad I continued. The story picked up substance again and now I look forward to the third (and final) book in the trilogy very much.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly futuristic view of Governments / Corporations 1%<br /><br />It is a great show! My only regret is it ends to soon. Firefly is a futuristic view of what we'll see in space at the final exploitation by Government / Corporation. When the primary goal of freedom / profit at any cost to you & me is greed / lust for the power hungry 1% ruling class.<br /><br />The bottom line for them is slowly taking from us until one day all of our natural resource are gone. Than when our children's wit of staying or going is lift with no options. Maybe if they can survey to 2060 and the profiteers lust isn't fulfilled we'll have serenity.

B00DGKQF2S|4.0|Sounds good. Kotzen sounds a lot like Chris Cornell. So if you like that vocal style, you'll like this disc. Billy sheehan and Portnoy are a fantastic rhythm section. Let's hope this is not just a one off. hate diggin news bands and then they fizzle out like Audioslave or Adrenaline Mob....

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I am back in school, with a toddler at home, so I did not have the time to utilize the school's resources. I had to watch this and write a paper on it. It definitely helped me to earn my &#34;A&#34; in my Personal Development course. It has also changed the way I eat. I recommend this documentary to everyone! I have loaned my copy out numerous times already!
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|How simple, but how powerful, these agreements are! It has become a lifetime goal to live according to these four simple principles.
B004W16LPQ|1.0|This is a terrible print of a very good movie. It is unwatchable in this presentation. Please get a HD quality print. One Eyed Jacks deserves to be seen in the highest quality.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|too hard, not easy at all.  I loved the old one that I could add my family's city to so i could check on them.  Please bring the old app back!
B001ECDVKE|5.0|With all the top stars of that time makes this a really good comedy sci fy. I really enjoyed it. The DVD was really great shape also.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I Love to read and this is great because I can download the book I want and don't have all the clutter of  all the books I have read stacked up everywhere.I usually give them away. this way I can erase them or keep them on my sd card.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|When we watched the first episode of Season 1, I assumed that would be all; however, both my wife and I &#34;caught the bug&#34;, and it is now one of our favorites.  We're now up to episode 4 of Season 3, and still with it !!!
B00008YLV2|5.0|This movie spends little time building up to the actual battle.  It does develop a few characters and let you get to know them so you care what happens to them, but then it jumps right into the action and just keeps building to the end.  The battle scenes are intense and you find yourself almost wanting to duck and cover throughout the movie.  It is fairly graphic and hard to watch at times, but it does a great job of showing the bravery of the soldiers who did the best they could in a horrific situation while showing how a lot of little decisions can add up to a big problem later (i.e. don't take enough water, ammo or night vision because they are heavy and you don't think you will need them).<br /><br />The recreation of the actions of MSgt Gordon and SFC Shughart who selflessly volunteered to go into a desperate situation to protect a downed helicopter pilot knowing that the chances for survival were extremely poor was especially striking and a little hard to watch knowing that they were awarded posthumous Congressional Medals of Honor for their bravery.  Bottom line is that while the movie most certainly is somewhat sensationalized to fit into a 2 hour Hollywood movie format with big budget stars etc, it also does a great job conveying the futility, fog and confusion of modern urban combat.
B00CVDM8QS|3.0|I like it... and I don't like it. There is some very good information, great analogies, and was to understand certain things in the universe. The problem for me is that often it is behind or under some ongoing theories and stories or myths etc. I like Richard Dawkins and have some of his other books. To me, this one works too hard to push or describe myth like things that overshadow the information. When I read some chapters I am thinking.&#34;yea yea yea, whatever, get to the info... how does that work?!&#34; Some chapters go straighter to the info and I find these refreshing. I've essentially marked my copy so one of my kids or a friend may skip the blather and get to the info.
B00CM9JKQM|3.0|i was looking forward to this release and frankly though its hard enough and La Torre sings very well, I was disappointed with the lack of melody on the tracks. The reich did go back to hard form rock, but except for the second track and \\"redemption\\" I'm having a hard time following the music. Lack of rythem and melody are the culprits. Sorry folks thats my opinion.<br /><br />UPDATE 12-7-13<br /><br />I found the word I was looking for that describes this cd well. HARMONY, a big lack of harmony.
B00E9PXI3S|4.0|PASSION is likely to be appreciated more by those already familiar with De Palma's films and career trajectory and the very artificial, surreal style he employs. In PASSION, De Palma returns to the genre for he is most celebrated and concocts a tale of shallow, catty advertising execs that tips over into a hallucinatory nightmare. It's absurd, outrageous, and devilishly clever, a film that playfully examines the surveillance culture which we currently inhabit.
B007BVMVDU|1.0|The extreme sexually graphic nature of the show was appalling.  I considered the show pornographic.  I would not recommend this show to anyone.
B00AA36RZY|5.0|This book really explain in depth form each design pattern thus the principles over OO design.<br />Its a great book for learning whit out teacher, I read one chapter for day, in week an a half i have finish<br />and I view the framework, java apis and designs in different form.<br />Each chapter begin with a problem, when you remember this problem its probably you remember<br />all that the chapter say about the design patter.
030758836X|2.0|In short, and I know I am in a minority position, but this book was not all that it is cracked up to be.  I actually had to slog through it.  I found that as I read on that I not only disliked most of the characters but also, could care less about them. It was not that the writing itself was bad, but that the characters , hardly at all, could make me feel sympathetic towards them in any way.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game free on Christmas Day 2012.<br /><br />What a great choice for the Free App of the Day!<br /><br />Everyone who likes physics games knows World of Goo, it's a great game on consoles, computers, and it's just as much fun on my phone and tablet. It's an awesome game and isn't some crappy, watered-down version like some games tend to do, it's the real deal.<br /><br />I definitely recommend buying it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Similar to 100 floors and the escape the ....... online games.  Challenging puzzles, and clues.  Great for someone with a few minutes hear or there to play.
B005EHQGTS|4.0|It definitely took me a bit of time to get used to using an app on my phone to control my PC. I've only used TeamViewer up until now, but this is a good app, it was made for mobile devices specifically and I like it a lot. If you need to remotely access your computer a lot, this is a good choice.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I have reasons<br /><br />1.wait wait wait.<br />When playing this game you have to raise your dragons by feeding them apples.<br />In order of getting Apples you need to get a farm.<br />Apples take 1hr to be harvested and your dragon eats more Apples when it grows.<br />breeding dragons and hatching crossbred eggs takes 2 hrs!<br /><br />2.MONEY OH MONEY.<br />you use gold to spend on things like.<br />-dragons<br />-important stuff<br />-harvest apples faster without waiting<br />And IF  you are impatient<br />You will be spending gold in minutes now you know.<br /><br />3.what to do<br />Your answer is is nothing you've done every thing and time to envy other people<br />nonsense.<br /><br />IMPATIENTNT PEOPLE YOU ARE WARNED!!!!
B0055S348W|5.0|I got this on July 14, 2013 along with several other apps that Amazon was offering for free as a special &#34;Free Utilities Apps&#34; day. It's a $13 application, so I figured why not download it? I actually, on an unrelated note, bought a wireless printer for the two laptops in my home last weekend and finally connected my phone to my printer using this app. The &#34;Find Printer&#34; feature is easy to use and can find printers using WiFi, Bluetooth, USB if you have proper cable, and can even use printers with the information stored on Cloud drives and remotely-controlled printers. It's a fantastic application for printing from your mobile device. I use it on my phone and my new tablet and it's just awesome.<br /><br />It can print web pages, photos, Google Docs files, Gmail e-mails, your calendar, and even your contacts list and pictures, all WIRELESSLY!<br /><br />I cannot reccomend this app enough! Yes, it is $12.95, that is a pretty penny for an app. But if you're vigilant, like me, you got it for free on July 14. It's a great deal, though, even for the hefty price tag if you print remotely often.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Sen Seth dunks says that this is a awesome game because it has outside the lab and elegant nachos lab thanks for hearing
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game a lot, it really got me stuck on the Flow series. It's a lot of fun and is quite the brain exerciser. Each puzzle is unique and there are hundreds of, almost 1000, levels ranging from 5x5 boards up to 14x14. The larger the board, the more difficult it is to complete. It's definitely fun times and is an absolute must for a download!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Much better picture and sound quality, more and better than my old VHS to be sure. A visual and sound experience I've already enjoyed several times.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|I originally &#34;purchased&#34; this game on June 28, 2013, it was free that day because it was the Free App of the Day on Amazon AppStore. It's a really fun game, I like it a lot. You race around, collecting money between different stores around some stereotypical redneck swamp then buy and sell goods at stores trying to make the most money in 15 turns. I probably wouldn't pay a dollar for it, I'm not much into paying for apps anyway, but it's a fun game if you have it or are willing to spend a dollar. It makes a great time killer at work or if you're bored waiting for something.
B004I11VZ0|5.0|Great story with amazing martial arts! Someone told be about IP MAN 1 and I was completely blown away with it! IP MAN 2 does the same thing all over again! I would highly recommend both movies to anyone who loves martial arts movies and also who love a good story with a lot of history! I personally like the subtitled versions of both movies, I think when they dub over them you lose some of the feeling in their voice and I can't stand when the lips don't sync with the voice!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|First off, I love Plants vs Zombies (PvZ).<br /><br />This version is a fantastic duplicate of the popular PC game. It's got a great soundtrack and has the full story and second story as well as access to the achievements and MOST, not all, of the extras included in the PC version.<br /><br />It's a fun tower-defense style game and is absolutely worth downloading.<br /><br />The ad says &#34;WiFi Download Only&#34;, but I was able to download using a 4G connection as the speeds are enough to allow it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app awesome, its no where compared to any other game! Its AMAZING and it doesnt freezes or anything the good thing is that it has levels to this game, I totally LOVE IT!!
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game is so much fun, I can't even stand it. It's a great brain-teaser and definitely a great time-waster if you need one. Even my mom likes playing it. It is absolutely worth the dollar. BUT, it does only have 44 levels, so it is incredibly short. I beat it in about 3 days. I got it for free on July 30, 2013 as the Free App of the Day on the Amazon AppStore and is just so fun, I can't even explain it.<br /><br />Definitely buy!! =D
B00BVYKWJI|2.0|Maybe the rest of of the season 2 is ok, but first hour we watched was so over the top that we are turned off the show.<br />We watched the first season but there is a limit to blood/guts, sex, etc.
B008458O3S|5.0|I played Trainyard Express (the free version) for many months before seeing this game for free on the Amazon AppStore as the Free App of the Day on November 12, 2012.<br /><br />This game is very confusing, kind of pain in the rear sometimes, and there are some many combinations of trying to fix the tracks to get everything in the right place that it's a bit infuriating, it's really everything a puzzle-lover like myself needs in a time-consuming game!<br /><br />It's a great sequel/continuation of Trainyard Express and definitely a good buy at only $2.99.
B00DHNB5CY|2.0|Lots of gore moments, not a lot of the original movie's camp feel. There are ideas planted that never fully develop. The hero's troubled relationship with his mother, the sister's drug addiction, it all fizzles as the movie rushes into the final act. In the end it's fun to watch, just not that memorable.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|The title of this app is apt to what it is: it's an alarm clock and it's extreme.<br /><br />This alarm clock is so annoying, it makes me want to smash my phone into the wall, but darn it, it wakes me up. The app lets you set as many alarms as you need and has many settings to determine how to wake you up. You can choose to have to solve simple, or difficult if your prefer, math problems or do some other kind of brain exercise that just is too much when you're groggy from sleeping for hours and hours. If you don't hit snooze or dismiss, the alarm WILL just drone on and on and on for hours. Just last week, I left it on the kitchen table, my alarm went off a 6 AM and when I woke at 9, it was STILL going off and said &#34;Alarm: 6 AM&#34; on it with my alarm tone blasting from the speaker. The app lets you use whatever sound you want to wake up, I prefer music, and will just repeat the sound over and over until you turn it off or the phone dies, whichever comes first.<br /><br />If you are tough to wake up, this is the alarm clock for you.
0307236722|5.0|This is a great cookbook with a lot of Martha's unique tips and tricks for perfect cakes, breads etc.  Love it!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This app is amazing, the single most useful app I own, which is a collection of 200+ apps.<br /><br />It provides connectivity between your phone/tablet and your PC by using WiFi to provide an actual URL address that you can use to download, upload, or just browse the contents of your device. It provides access to all the hidden system folders on your phone that aren't available normally and lets your organize your content or move it on and off the device without deleting it if you want to back it up onto an external drive.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this app and I use it all the time.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Outstanding writing for a cable series.  The acting is believable and the actors are well selected.  love the series and look forward to the upcoming 6th season!
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|This is a great game for kindle fire Hd one of the best games I've played controls are great to I usually don't like these kind of games because of the controls but the controls work really good this is a must have game if you like rpg games
1451627297|5.0|I saved this book for my summer vacation and that was a good move.  I simply could not stop reading it and I did not have to!  This is a masterpiece-enjoyable on so many levels.  Save it for your \\"down\\" time when you want to be caught up in an enchanting and thought-provoking adventure!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|We have downloaded this app 5 times, we continue to have major problems lagging and loading speed.  VERY FRUSTRATING! What is a way to have this problem resolved? We have U-verse Internet. Can't understand why so many problems.
B003KGBIS4|5.0|This is a fantastic movie that is pure visual candy with a decent story line that takes you on the purest of unpredictable adventures. The deep character development and attention to details make Wes Anderson's movies great. The acting cast is also great in this film too.
B006YC74E8|1.0|I bought this app after reading the reviews it worked good downloading but the moment i stared using it is when everything went downhill. The screens and images started to pile up and the ones from before wouldn't go away then the screen would randomly go black and then it just stopped working. MY WHOLE KINDLE!!!! It would sometimes sorta turn on but the screen looked like one of those old movies. Where the grey ick cut in and out then it would go black. I called amazon and they sent me a new kindle, i think it was something internal with my old kindle but something about this app really threw it over the edge.<br />SAVE YOUR KINDLE DO NOT BUY
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|syfi, fun, and adventurous...who could ask for more! Love them characters and the Doctor is great. you need to watch all the shows for the ongoing story line with the characters.
B00594XOZU|1.0|it keeps stopping. Ugh. Not reccomended for kindle fires. This was a complete waist of my time. I dont give a s*** about this app. Once again, UGH.
140006922X|1.0|Mr. Aslan displays a clear anti-Christian bias, but besides his personal views, his lack of scholarship and poor cultural understanding of 1st century Palestine makes his suppositions hollow and academically weak.  Don't waste your time on what is clearly an attempt to discredit Jesus in order to further Islam.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Even though you do have to purchase extras, it's well worth the price. I could play this game for days on end trying to beat my own score.
B002QEXT4W|5.0|Very nice package reissue with excellent photos and notes make this well worth picking up . After buying this I ordered Salvo's Reissue of the next in the series of Procol's Ninth this week.<br />Remastering is very well done but as mentioned in other reviews there is compression,  although it doesn't get overbearing like many others . There are dynamics of the recording preserved .It is louder though .<br />Hats off to the team at Salvo that put this together .
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Recommended for all ages. It has great graphics. Looks so real!! I love beauty. It's so fun to take care of her.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This is dark and horrible...so why do I love it?  Guess I need a therapist for that. :)  Received this in good time.  Good quality.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I loved the movie but you really understand Billy and Paul knew exactly what they were doing and it wasn't luck.  The movie made it seems like they tried all this stuff in one season but really it was over a series of seasons.
B002M89UMW|5.0|One of my absolute favorites. Good all around, lovely songs, and Judy is amazing as always. One of her best.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Too much TV is mindless trash.  I enjoy this one a great deal.  Especially the adolescent rebellion from the sheriff's daughter was entertaining and so typical of teens.
B009PNQUXO|1.0|Well I thought I was getting something better than what I was looking for. I was not able to download some of the games I wanted to for my Kindles. But not able to do so.
B000000H57|5.0|I don't want to make this review long because i can write all night til my fingers bleed but if you know Type O then you know what i mean. This album from start to finish is o<br />amazing AMAZING ! Very poetic,deep,dark,dreary & beautifully sad. Every single song has its own individual sound & style and sense of essence that makes this an instant classic. As a follow up to Bloody Kisses(another great album) this has some very beautiful melodies,the drums are great,the bass is deep and heavy. Peter's voice is so on point here you can just totally feel what he is saying & if you can sorta relate youll understand what i mean when i say you can feel it. Red<br />Water,Haunted,Wolf Moon,Green<br />Man,Love You To Death,Die With<br />Me,Burnt Flowers Fallen. All<br />legendary beautiful songs. To me their version of Cinnamon Girl by Neil Young is amazing,i find this is their best song they covered since Hey Peter but they are all great. The style on this album is more of a beautiful approach. Lots of piano mixes and weird samples like Peters garbage truck on Green Man(about his job in the parks department.) The use of the piano and chorus mixed vocals between the entire band. Like group singing like Can't Lose You(Bloody Kisses) this is the most beautiful & positive album they ever made. This was back when Peter still was in a content to almost perfect time in his life,before his mom getting sick& his dad dying as well as being cheated on and the ultimate contemplatio.n of suicide(World Coming Down) This was some of the peak vocals for Peter just listen to Love you to Death,which is 1 of my top 3 favorites on the album. The song Haunted just is so eerily beautiful it is literally haunting. As well as Wolf Moon,the song right there & especially Josh Silver is the reason i picked up a few keyboards and add Type O style elements to my music. This is essential & prime Type O it is a must own for a newcomer or a fan. So many excellent songs and no filler. GO BUY IT YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED !
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I love this. Very glad I took a chance a bought it. She is amazing in my opinion.I have to keep writing 17 word limit.

B00D8RYV52|3.0|This one is not as good as all the others my little sister thinks there should  be more  mini games.
B00DL47RQ2|3.0|The film bounces back and forth between Cate Blanchett's life before and after her fall from grace.  Although the story line is easy to follow, the social message the movie delivers is disconnected.  Woody could have tied it all in a nice tight emotional package, but some of the emotional impact was left on the table.<br /><br />Also, the story takes place mostly in San Francisco, which was a waste, since most of the main characters possessed a definite New York look and feel.  Why shoot a movie in San Francisco when the movie is about New Yorkers?  A great film maker would have used the setting in order to accentuate the story line or message, but frankly this movie could have been shot in any major city without much effect.<br /><br />Entertaining enough, but I wasn't challenged by the movie and got bored part of the way through it.
0307341550|4.0|I have just read all three of Gillian Flynn's Novels, starting with Gone Girl, then onto Dark Places, then Sharp Objects. That's the order of how ratings too, I found. Gone girl being the best, second place dark places and third place being Sharp Objects.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Sharp Objects because of how well it is written, how much suspense I felt as a reader, and how nervous the book made me feel. I could feel something bad happening at the turn of every page, and was dreaded reading on but at the same time needed to find out what was going to happen. Fynn's characters, I think, are very well crafted. A lot of people have commented saying they didn't find them believable, and I think you would find them hard to find believable if you didn't know people like the characters. I have to admit that unfortunately I have come across individuals who are mentally scared in such a way, or mothers like the novel portrays. Therefore, I think from my experience, the book adequately and successfully fleshes out the implications of abuse. Its important to be able to understand a character, and I think this novel is able to see the characters mind, but at the same time, you need to be able to recognise the characters traits. If you have not come across such a character (or similar) in real life, you would indeed find the character very difficult to believe and digest. I found Camille the protagonist a character that was self destructive, to the point of annoyance *spoiler* (like when she is unable to refuse ecstasy from her younger sister) her lack of will power annoyed me, but I think it was just a realistic portrayal of someone who is so mentally scared. Its the actions that would be in line with a realistic portrayal of such a person. I found that I still wanted a good ending for Camille, and I felt an immense amount of sadness for her throughout the novel, despite also feeling a lot of annoyance for how she acts so destructively or stupidly in some scenes.  I think itsthe feelings one would feel for someone who is 'lost cause'; sorry for them but at the same time frustrated. I think Gillian Flynn is able to perfectly encapsulate that in her protagonist, and her portrayal of Camille I found nothing short of pure literary art.<br /><br />The novel is extremely degrading of the sexes, depressing, and some parts are horrible to read, but I don't feel they are cheap shots to shock the reader. There are underlying literary tools of symbolism which lead up to the end, and are to depict the mentality of the small town as a whole, and the evil that underlies it. The ending shocked me a little, as in I wasn't sure if I saw it coming or not. It was definitely an option I had considered whilst reading the novel, maybe not the twist I thought would come, but definitely an option I had already imagined. Unlike Dark places, where the ending did come as much more of a shock, this book is just suspense filled so much through out, that the ending may leave one a tiny, tiny bit disappointed. However, it was still fun to read.<br /><br />Also, unlike Gone Girl and Dark Places, where I didn't miss a single syllable and sometimes had to re-read pages as I found them so fascinating, I was able to (occasionally) put it down, and I did at times skip a paragraph or two (the paragraphs of her articles) or the long descriptions about simply entering someone's home.<br /><br />Despite all this, I found the story really, really, interesting, thourally crafted. I think the main problem with the book is that the story line is so interesting that you hope the ending is going to be EVEN MORE interesting and leave you gasping, which it doesn't quite do. However you will gasp at various parts of the book, even if the ending didn't quite match up to the rest of the book.<br />Really enjoyed it over all, and ABSOLUTELY loved the psychology behind Gone Girl, and the power of Misinterpretation in Dark Places. Definitely a fan, and this is a good first book for the author, but what is promising is it isn't her best, she is getting better and more intelligent and intense with each novel she writes. Cannot wait for her next one!
1452110581|2.0|These poems are written by someone who simply is not wild about cats, because I loved the dog poems by the same author.  But my cats, who have all been excellent writers, did not agree one bit with the philosophies commented upon in this little book of cat poetry.  I have had cats for over 50 years, and my current one is such a poet, such an author, that I offered him the book itself to pee on.  And that's what he would have done, had he been that sort of cat.  In all my years as a cat lover, having been owned by many excellent cats, only ONE cat has ever peed outside the box.  And he would have been far, far too polite to write poetry about it.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Just plugged it into my Ubuntu laptop and it started working. Very fast lock in time, just a couple of minutes.
B000056BAG|5.0|Everyone is entitled to their own opinion regarding music. I was in 8th grade when this album was first released and this most definitely made a huge impact on my life. I still listen to these songs every day; they live infinitely in my music library. It's been 12 years since it's release and now I finally bought this album on vinyl for my record collection.<br /><br />May I also suggest buying the \\"Bananaz\\" film, a documentary about the Gorillaz first two albums. This gives great insight on creators Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett, and is a must for Gorillaz fans as well. Cheers!
B0044C5SCU|4.0|Fringe is a very intriguing show that focuses on what could happen if you let your imagination go wild!  It also focuses on the power of love, and how a far a parent would go to save a child.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love it. It challenges me without making me feel stupid.  I love the 3D, even tho I'm still trying to adjust to that. But thats just me.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|I love this series and The Eye of God is as good as any book in the series. Action packed fun. If you like Rollins you will like this book.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I love a good love story and this made the cut.  I have watched this movie over and over again and I find a new reason to love it each time I watch it.  I would love to see a sequel.  The ending leaves you wondering.  Just awesome!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is grate it has every thing from adventure to determination to team work I would recommend this book to a mature teen who can deal with reading about death
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|FINALLY! I am so glad this concert is getting released on dvd after 20 years. I've had the tv edit for years, now I can do away with it. This is a MUST own, placed my order today :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Very dramatic and powerful. The stories are always exciting. Leaves you wanting more and I can't wait for season 4!
B008ASGP3U|3.0|I believe that Rankin overdoes the drinking problem of Rebus. It might be true that people in Scotland drink a lot, but, to the point that he needs help in his bad drinking habits, and in everyone of the Rebus stories it is the same, decredits<br />him and is very tiresome.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Another great book in the series of Game of Thrones and the best book so far. The HBO series is great but the books are sooo much better! Thanks George R.R. Martin. Now I'm starting book 4.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like this game for its likeness to command & conquer except for all the fighting its like you are the mayor and you need to assure that your city thrives
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Not a heavy read but the story is an age old tale of how a mother's intentions toward her daughter(s) are often mis-interpreted until the daughter(s)  have enough experience to know that mothers love is unconditional and their actions are done out of love.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Again just another part of the movies that I had too have. Again it was a must have.so thank You.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The Hunger Games movie was better than expected. I loved the books and the cast and crew of the movie did a wonderful job. I look forward to the other two movies.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I just can not get enough of this game. Really keeps you thinking,and seems to be an awesome brain training game. Starts off with fairly easy choices (example:French flag+lips=French Kiss) and gradually works up to the more difficult ones.Fun for all ages!!! 5 stars
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I was never a big fan of Uno.  But, if you have the board game, and love uno or even like it alot, then this game is for you.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|This game challenges you to solve a puzzle by using tools to copy the design on a white ball. You need to draw shapes on the ball using a certain sequence. The 44 levels provide a good challenge with a good variety of tools, but I wish there were more levels and more difficult levels. I also wish the balls weren't so small, although you can zoom in.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|My husband and I rented this movie last night on our cable account and LOVED it! My daughter and her fiance who are movie fanatics also had already seen it and really liked it. It was non-stop action and loved the inventive fighting and battle scenes. Dwayne Johnson was awesome in this and we did not mind at all that they killed off the over-rated Channing Tatum. Adrianne Palicki was kick ass! We would buy this movie because we would watch it many times. I don't get all the terrible reviews people are giving it on Amazon. Don't listen to them!
1434102750|2.0|I ordered this book after reading a reference to it in someone's blog post.<br /><br />I am a bit disappointed to be honest. If you are a successful person, and have more than 5-10+ years of experience in your field, then you have probably already learned and internalized these techniques quite naturally.<br /><br />This would probably be a helpful book for someone just starting out in their career, or perhaps someone still in school - but I suspect that until the student is ready, the lesson would be lost.<br /><br />On the other hand, given that most folks seem to have limited natural curiosity - within their own field of endeavor, to say nothing of investing effort in expanding beyond that boundary - perhaps the admonition to acquire broad and general knowledge may have some merit.  If you get nothing else out of this book - and if it inspires you to invest effort in cultivating depth in areas outside of your professional focus - then this book is well worth the cost.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Totally, amazingly great!  Not only are the actors superb, but they are their characters.  There are great twists and surprises that make you want to keep watching.  The only flaw I have is that the season is too short!
B005LAII8A|3.0|Looper<br />A clever sci fi scenario, that is interesting up until the end, and above all one that<br />has not copied other movies (as is often the case lately).<br />Now, if you like to watch NYC destroyed once more or you like explosions<br />and gunfights, then this is not a movie for you.<br />The acting is not all that great but then again it is a movie where Bruce Willis<br />is the villain, so it is a little unusual.<br />My basic disagreement with the movie is why they use such old style<br />weapons when there are such advanced things as time travel in the movie<br />An interesting movie to watch
B004EF65QA|5.0|The BBC did a great job of turning this classic novel into a movie miniseries.  In fact, I think they even improved upon the ending. Although I love this series, the final 9 minutes of episode four are by far, my favorite!
B002JH3TW8|5.0|It works as intended.  Quality seems fine.  I picked one with a short cable so that there wouldn't be any added stress to the ports like there would be with a ridged adapter.
B003B96AOW|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Deadpool character and I just had to buy this action figure after I completed his game. I was in for a pleasant surprise when it got delivered. The quality is excellent and it's extremely well detailed. Thank you Diamond Select and Amazon! I must add that I don't feel like removing it from its box and it's still sealed!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Black Sabbath has made a very good collection of all new but &#34;Black Sabbath sounding&#34; music, highly recommend this album to new and old classic rock lovers
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My younger kids love it. Very addictive. Once you start its hard to stop. Kids will play it till the batteries die.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|absolutely love this album, one of the best DP albums in years.  if you're a Deep Purple fan (like me) you have to have this album just because it's Deep Purple or if you just want to hear some well written guitar and organ driven rock this will more than fit the bill
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I got this game for the girls I watch they love horse's. I needed something I could give them for car rides and this one was better then the last horse game I had for them they can do more with this one then the last one
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I was amazed at how honest this video is about her life.  I'm sure it glossed over some details and made it kid friendly but all in all I enjoyed watching it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just joined super cool amazing ways to view different decorating ideas absolutily love being able to pin things on my wall
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This is similar to other games I have played.  While the Minions are some of my favorite characters it just took too long to load.
B007X70NVO|5.0|Great movie about Moto GP (motorcycle Grand Prix) racing, and maybe the greatest racer of all, Valentino Rossi. Loved it.
B0095P27DE|1.0|I thought this would be interesting but it wasn't.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.  Waste of money. Junk.
B008VBYN80|5.0|This game is really fun, you get to create your own empire and fight other empires. You also do many quest, I definitely give this 5 stars
B001HDWKMA|5.0|I already have this album on CD, but purchased it as an MP3 to listen on the cloud. I love Ray's voice and his music. Wish he would make a comeback and another album soon!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|At first, the only reason I read this book was because I had to do a project on it, but swoon I started getting really into it, and next thing I know, I couldn't put it down.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Did not care for the disturbing and sad personalities. too dark for my taste. Just not my type of book.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|The very first time I saw this movie, I liked it but that was only bits and pieces. I wanted to see more and finally one night I took the time to see it and I tell you, it was good. I have heard many of my race say that well I don't care for the \\"n\\"word liberally said in the movie. First of all, consider the time here. we had no control of that. slavery was the order of the day and it wasn't like they were being cordial and kind calling us negroes. They was cordial if they said \\"negra\\" out their mouth. so to me, I'm not tripping on that.Jamie Foxx,from the time he shook that blanket off him in the first scene and took over, I loved Django. he was my hero. I loved the way he used a gun. how he was hellbent and determined to get his wife broomHilda back even though it was dangerous for ALL involved. I never forgot Schultz(Christopher Walz in his sidekick award winning role)warn him that Mississippi was no place for any man,neither free or slave. never forgot it. Leonardo DiCaprio made me despise him totally. no love for Mr/Monsiour Candie whatsoever or his funky,evertrusting slave flunky Samuel Jackson either. matter of fact, no one would have been the wiser if Jackson's character told the deal from the start.but they didn't count on Django doing what he did either, and really couldn't feel sorry for them at the end of the film. great film. wasn't crazy for the bloodshed,cussing. the KKK scene was hysterical. it got so, there was a girl at work who had the whole scene down pat too and could imitate it. boy we would fall out each and every time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is exactly what I have been looking for. I have been using my &#34;Smart&#34; TV for the past two years to stream content from Amazon, YouTube and Netflix.  But the user interface is clunky and I might as well forget about them ever updating the apps. Plus, my TV does not have a means for me to stream my music collection. But with the Chromecast, you know that the user interface will always be up to date since it uses apps from your phone/tablet. I will be able to stream my music from Google's music service, watch any YouTube videos, and also my Netflix subscription. The only thing lacking is the ability to stream TV shows and movie rentals from Amazon. Amazon has been my main service for this for the past two years, so I have to admit this kind of sucks. It is really in Amazon's best interest to add support or they will loose a lot of customers. Google also offers a TV and movie service that is supports Chromecast; so I plan on using that from now on, assuming Amazon does not come out with a Chromecast friendly app soon.<br /><br />With that said, I am even more excited about what the DIY community might come up with. Google has already released beta API's for developers to start tinkering with, and the online community has already started coming up with some amazing apps. One developer has already written an app that will allow you to cast pictures and videos from your phone to the TV. He also wrote another app that allows streaming from cloud services, like Drive, Dropbox, and Box. Assuming Google doesn't block these abilities, they should be released to the general public in the near future ... cross your fingers. This little Chromecast is about to become a power house if Google allows it.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I don't remember when I have laughed so hard at a movie!  My daughter and I are still throwing lines around and laughing at them again this next day.  The fact that it is a combination horror and comedy - and pulls both off -  tells you pretty much all you need to know.  Highly recommend!
B002OR0RP0|5.0|This is a great movie for family weekend fun. a great movie to take your family too on a rainy day.. i highly recommend.
0062255657|1.0|Odd little book that did not impress me, had hoped it would be a good one as it was recommended on the Today Show.
B00CBKLO52|1.0|I would not purchase this game.  It's not the type of game that works well on a Kindle because of the lack of controls.  As a private pilot I thought this might be fun to play with while waiting in line at the bank, doctor's office etc.  It was not.  I crashed so many times I expected the FAA to give me a call. The planes that you get to fly are limited and you quickly lose orientation and once again...crash.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|What can I say that wouldn't be redundant of all of the other positive reviews? Probably nothing.<br /><br />Scalzi will become one of the grand masters of SciFi. I love rip-roaring space operas, and this is one of the best I've read in years. Actually, I'm writing this after reading it for the second time. By the end of the book, you feel like you've known John Perry all of your life.<br /><br />On the strength of this book, I read all of the SciFi Scalzi has written. I haven't been disappointed. Do yourself a favor and get this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very fun game! addictive fun for adults Its kinda hard so I don't see a small child playing it very well but maybe I'm wrong but great game lots of fun!
B005LAIIKI|4.0|Django Unchained Bowling for Movies Score: 265.406 of 300<br /><br />Before I get started, a word:<br />When I was fresh out of high school and attending junior college I started dating a bright, beautiful, entertaining lady body builder.  Her name is lost to time but one fine day she looked at me and said, \\"Obstacles are what you see when you lose sight of your goals.\\"  She then picked me up in fireman's carry, spun me around, and threw me into a wood fence.  Alas, our love was not meant to be but what she said stuck.  Obstacles truly are what you see when you lose sight of your goals and if you read enough of the reviews (which I did) or even the professional movie critics you'll find plenty of obstacles to lose sight with.  All the controversy this movie generated really doesn't have much to do with the movie itself.  After careful consideration I made a movie dude decision to not even really touch on any of them.  Controversy is courted by Hollywood because it generates interest, interest generates ticket sales, and ticket sales are what make the world go round.  Ok, I feel better now and I think I can give a good overview of the film :]<br /><br />We own the Blu Ray, DVD, Digital Copy version of this movie<br /><br />Most movies score in the 120-160 range, those would be your average run of the mile movies.  If a film breaks 200 it's really something special.  The bowling for movies rating system works just like a bowling match with this one exception - it has literally nothing to do with bowling but does utilize a quasi-pseudo-science and a healthy dose of grape jelly, electric fences, and common household blenders.  Movies go in one side and a comprehensive score comes out the other.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />1.  If a 70's spaghetti-western hooked up with a 70's exploitation film, Django would be their love child... and I LOVE spaghetti-westerns and exploitation films (just lucky I guess).<br />2.  Christoph Waltz gives a career defining performance as the dentist turned bounty hunter and slave free-er dude (a well deserved Academy Award)<br />3.  Frankly, I never really cared much for Jamie Foxx - I mean as good as Booty Call was - he just never gave an inspired performance (or maybe I just never saw one), until now.  WOW, did his stock go up with me.<br />4.  Over the top wit, action, and blood (it's a Tarantino movie after all and he never lets you forget)<br />5.  Django has a WONDERFUL soundtrack, perfectly married to the on-screen action, feeling, and emotions<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />1.  Stephen, the house slave - Samuel Jackson's performance was so convincing I was utterly disgusted and felt sick watching this repulsive character<br />2.  The story goes off the rails a bit and stretches credibility... hey man, it's only a movie, I get it but even I had to cringe at some of the plot twists which defied reality and logic.  A forgivable sin all things considered but a sin none-the-less<br />3.  All the \\"obstacles\\" which keep people from seeing this movie over ridiculous concerns about certain non-PC terms, fictitious story-related brutality, and other tomfoolery surrounding the movie - it taints what otherwise is a very good film.<br />4.  Leonardo DiCaprio... oh, he did a great job playing the vicious, cruel, repugnant owner of Candyland - a southern plantation, I just really don't like Leonardo.<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews.

B0084B5TK8|5.0|Not what I expected for a story about vampires, and that's a good thing. And I liked that it was free :)
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|This game doesn't look like it's for teens, and it isn't, but I expected more from the game. All you do is click once and a while, or scribble with you're finger. Could be much better, but I give it 4 stars.
B00AOCJEXS|5.0|This series kept my interest throughout.  The story kept me questioning how I would handle the same situations.  Noah Wyle is a very engaging actor.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Always loved this movie. Glad to add it to my collection. Not real glad I am being forced to write this many words for the feedback. It should be up to me how many words I use.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I'm still reading it, when will it ever end? I know it's J.K. Rowling, but where is the suspense, excitement or Lord Voldermort? Please return to Hogwarts once more...
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This app has helped me keep track of time and is so easy to create and stop an alarm. Before I used this app I had problems setting my alarm clock and remembering if I set it for the right time or not. With this app I can manage all of the different times I need to get up during the week. A must buy for a busy person.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Like Liam Nissen, Stunts were fun to watch.<br />Good Action Movie.<br />Fun, Fast, nothing serious.<br />This is the better of the two movies by far.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Fun game.  No time limits or penalties.  Somewhat random tapping to acquire objects needed, but then you must think to use them.  Clues given frequently but tapping/placement must be precise on a 7&quot; screen.  Has kept me busy!
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|This was a good family movie. Nice to see Jack Black as the underdog.<br />This comedy Trio worked. Very enjoyable.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Easy to use. Not a lot of computer knowledge necessary to get info. Good for a person who doesn't want to spend time getting accurate reports.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This is a Very funny movie.  Excellent adventure.  I could watch this movie over and over again.  Great family film.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|This type cover is just what I needed for protection when traveling and taking to pool without overspending on a cover that is overkill for me.
B000001ESP|5.0|I never heard the original release but I love this cd despite the remaster.  It contains some signature songs but I got it for the songs I'm not familiar with.  I just play it over and over.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I love the CD. The only thing that is diapointing is<br />\\"Black Or White\\" on this album doesn't have the<br />opening intro between father & son like on the<br />Michael Jackson History volume 1 CD and on<br />the Michael Jackson \\"This Is It\\" tour<br />CD soundtrack (Disc number one)
B007I2BZIE|5.0|My obsession with this cd is more subtle; I wasn't sure if I liked their new sound since Geddy's voice is slightly different here.  I still admire their creative prowess and listen to this one as much as any other Rush cd.  They always hit their mark and I am confident that I will like any work they release. Even though some older fans gave this an average review I love it because it is outside the box.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|I have this in album. Got it to play on my kindle or computer. Days of high tech. I have always liked Phil Collins. There was a couple of songs I wanted. So I just downloaded the whole album to my cloud. Now I enjoy listening to it on my kindle and computer.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Good music, fun story. My teenage daughter really likes the cup song. Probably not appropriate for younger kids to watch.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great app! I took the time to make a review bc I like this game a lot and so does my daughter!!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|The story is about the side effects of antidepressants. The mystery has an interesting twist and the acting is quite credible.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|WOW. This book had so much going on that it was hard to keep to keep track. I love Christian and Ana's story. It makes you wonder how the ending will play out. Especially if the couple stays together.
B005MMZ63C|5.0|The first time I saw Citizen Kane was a crappy scratch filled version on local public television.  I wondered how this could be considered such a classic of film making.  Watching the HD version made it come more alive and allowed me to appreciate the cinematic techniques at play.<br /><br />Its subject matter has managed to stay fresh and seems to demonstrate that things have not changed so much since the &#34;good old days&#34;.
B001AZFO14|5.0|Kurt Russell fans will love this. A bit schlockey in some parts, but, very entertaining. I recommend this for anyone looking for a little action adventure.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|The puzzles are somewhat easy with a few hard ones mixed in, but using hint is helpful in most instances. Good story line too.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|This is one of Hitchcock's best movies. The only thing I have never understood (perhaps I missed it) is how the bad guys knew Mr. Thornhill would be on the train to Chicago?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was so pulled into this book!  it was dark and brutal and so gut wrenching that you felt so deeply for the characters and what Sky had been through.  I had to finish this story once i started it as it was so hard to go back to the real world, I needed to know what happened to Sky and Dean!  I definately reccomend reading this one.
B00340LM8C|5.0|How can you go wrong with Carey Grant and Grace Kelly? This is as good as it gets - don't miss it.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Amusing, entertaining, profound ... A book to think about.  Adichie describes a complicated but realistic society of expats and immigrants.
B008476HBM|5.0|as I have three versions of the films made from the book and the book you can l tell i am a real fan<br />she writes almost for a stage play and her own world was fasinating to me
B001BANK32|5.0|I loved this books terrifying and descriptive nature. I'm sad it had to come to an end. Looking forward to reading more of Stephen KIngs scary books
B004LWZWBU|3.0|I ordered this for my husband's birthday because he is an avid bird watcher.  He did enjoy it and so did I.  There are some parts that are not very realistic, but then it's just a movie.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I think this game is cool it inspires your kids to imagine. You have your own super power I think people should get this game
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Lots of Willis' action! Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Good casting and special effects are excellent. Photography was super.
B000784WMW|3.0|This is BY FAR the best rendition of Jane Eyre.  I like it SO MUCH that I went ahead and purchased the movie on DVD (I already have it on videotape).  I was hoping that by purchasing the DVD, the picture quality would be better as is with MOST DVDs.  Unfortunately, it is not.  I am wondering if any one else has noticed this in their copy?  There is an annoying blurry, transparent triple outline of the actors sometimes.  And, it occurs more when the actors are further away from the camera.  When there are closeups, there are no &#34;outlines.&#34;  The video quality is not grainy--but it is VERY ANNOYING with these outlines.  I will try to fiddle with my television controls.  And, no, I DO NOT have Blue-ray.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait for the new season to begin!  I wish I had not waited this long to watch this show.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|A very good fun exciting game there is lots to do and you never get bored ever ever I find it entertaining for all ages
B00CISC2DA|5.0|I am glad that I bought this disk. it is everything id expect from BoC and more. I would rate it 3rd favorite on my list.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game in the world also made FRANCHISE. Also this is a great experimce for young terns and adults
B006LSZECO|3.0|Found the plot to be a little predictable. Though I did enjoy the \\"Cool Girl\\" insights. Some of the storyline about Amy's psycho obsession was too over the top to believe.
B004IRLQCC|5.0|Not a lot to say, this is Eric at his best. I saw a very similar concert in NYC,,, the best guitar ever.
030758836X|3.0|She is an excellent writer.  The story and characters are very good. Halfway through the book the story really comes to life and you can't wait to finish it. However, I seriously hated the ending.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I was in New York last summer and got to see this play on broadway.  It was fabulous!  I had to have the cd.
B00DU74U74|3.0|Of course, books are usually better.  I just could not get into the casting choices.  Maybe if you haven't read the book, you will like it better than I did.
B00AEFXLBQ|5.0|Audrey Hepburn is beautiful, the clothes are icons! The story isn't my favorite of all her films, but I think it is great. It is referenced a lot, and I think it would benefit anyone who loves old films, or Audrey to see this one!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|The best show on tv, bar none.  I bought all of the seasons so I could watch them in order.  I am not a big tv watcher so I never watched the show when it first aired.  I am now a huge fan!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Almost scary how timely this book is. Well written and thought out. On to the next book and hopefully the same quality.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|The best show on tv, bar none. I bought all of the seasons so I could watch them in order. I am not a big tv watcher so I never watched the show when it first aired. I am now a huge fan!
B006IGZX0C|5.0|The  audio and video were perfect and we paused it when ever we wanted. Just like renting from a video store only no scratches on the DVD!
B000HL09SA|5.0|Such a touching movie. I've seen it 5 times and will continue to watch over and over. Diane Lane is wonderful
B005IQZB14|5.0|I went out on the PCT in 1993 with a girl friend for a few days.  We started near Tualamme Meadows and went south to Mammouth.  Cheryl's book brought back such memories of our little foray on the trail.  She told the experience so beautifully.  I could relate to every blister, every mosquito bite, the heaviness of the horrible pack, the wonderful people we met and the weird ones too.  Her mother was the glue that held her family together.  When the glue goes so does the family.  You could really feel her pain and confusion at the loss of her mother.  This was a great book.
000744785X|3.0|Originally, Storm of Swords , was printed as one book, not two. That is why I nag. The original also sold for 9.99 but of course, with the hype of an awesome story, publisher has halved the book and sold each one for double the price of the original.<br /><br />Lesson to be learned: when married to a &#34;Geek&#34; organize their books and you will probably find the originals and not pay allot.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Both my 7 and 4 year old grandsons like this game.  I really don't know much about how it's played.
B002CN2NCG|5.0|&#34;Best movie ever made that never got a sequel.&#34;  I read that somewhere and I couldn't agree more.  The cast is remarkable, they all create characters that you care about.  You even hate the bad guys the way you should, and feel good in the end with the way justice is served.  It has some corny old western features like the fact that the bad guys always miss when they shoot, and the good guys always hit, but the overall quality of the movie made that not bother me.  There should have been a sequel to this movie.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this app. but I wish it was longer.  please give more updates soon.  Had so much fun with my husband-to-be figuring out the clues.
B003B1X80Y|4.0|A love story that has been done before, but still pulls you in.  It reminded me of childhood innocence, and the grandeur of first love.
B001R60ESE|5.0|Hey! Have some friends over, pop this in the blu-ray, and enjoy the event.<br />I wonder how much it would've cost to actually be there!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Exceptional graphics and I felt I couldn't quit til I got to the next level. Addicting and I just couldn't stop til I was out of bananas. :)
B0064X7FVE|2.0|There is too much going on now. It's kind of hard to navigate.  I like the previous version much better.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|I bought all three seasons for my husband as a gift since he enjoyed this series very much and it is no longer on.
B005ZUR724|1.0|This game has great potential, I have been playing for quite some time, unfortunately hackers have taken over and the game is unplayable. As of 8/4/2013 gameloft has done nothing to correct this issue and it has been weeks scince the problem has started. I would definitely NOT recommend this game to anyone untill the problem has been solved.
B000002L7Y|5.0|Bought as a gift for a friend. She has almsot all of their CD's but not this one so it is a gift for her.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Good book, easy to read, I am glad that I read it.  I think I bought it for four bucks which for that price is pretty dang on good.  It's not in the class of the Song of Ice and Fire books or Lord of the Rings or anything but it was a good read.  Quick and easy.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|What can i say. Andrea Bocelli is  the best ! Wonderful voice. I have  all but 1 of his CD's so i must get  them too one of these days.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|The Avengers was true to comic book style literature with super heroes saving the day. The muffled violence made it suitable for all age levels.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|This movie was heart breaking even though i saw it on the news  when it happened it was very disturbing to see the movie. The performance by all  was so amazine.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Matilda. The movie had a blend of suspense and humor that was engrossing and stimulating. The touch of fantasy added to its overall appeal.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This was a good movie though all characters are mentally ill it showed what they go through when they have a disease that is not  handled when  medication is not taken properly.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The characters were well defined and the description of the fighting<br />in the war was realistic and chilling. All in all a good read!
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I bought this for my husband a long with  the other two seasons since  my husband enjoyed  it so much.
B000002J1M|5.0|Like Yes's \\"Your Move\\", \\"Watcher of the Sky's\\" pulls you in immediately. Then it just keeps going..if you like progressive rock at all this is a must have.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Well what can i say. This was avery entertaining movie on what  can happen when a person gets to involved with  the fast lane.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I thought this book, like the other series, would end after the 3rd book. It was okay, but I was not expecting to be left hanging. If I have to wait till the next one comes out, it better be really good. I was left with lots of unanswered questions, so I will be waiting for the next one.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|This was a very entertaining movie. A good one but not great. I feel it is worth buying and watching.
1476733953|5.0|A friend mentioned this book and I thought I would try it. I was not disappointed, even though I am not a die hard sci fan. Howey is a very good story teller and his characters are quite believable.I imagine this series may be brought to film and I'll be looking  forward to it!
B0091LS07E|2.0|I am not a big fan of Alicia Keys but i do like a few of her songs so that is why i bought this CD.
B00DU74U74|3.0|I was watching this movie and before it finished, it got to the part where it said \\"months later\\" and then it stopped and I couldn't get it back to where it stopped so I could see the ending of the movie. I tried it again later on and it still did the same thing. The movie was interesting but not worth trying again. This is the 2nd movie I have rented from Amazon with those same results, I never was able to see the end. I am not so sure I will rent any more of movies from Amazon since they haven't perfected what ever it takes to finish them out.<br /><br />Dorothy Frassmann
B0001XPZGA|2.0|I like the album but the vinyl came scratched and has surface noise.<br />And I can't returned it because I would have to pay for the MP3's.
B000002INJ|5.0|since i now this band befor 17 years i'm buying just original cds !<br />to heer good, to see the photos and all the stuf<br />and to give recpect to the band !!!
B000005AYL|1.0|I bought the vinyl, it came without the original album cover and the album is scratched. Every song on both sides skips. it's impossible to listen.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|hello, i've been at too shows of scorpions in israel<br />and i love them since i was 13 years old and they getting beter and beter<br />maor meir from israel !!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing book. Second time reading it. What a wonderful way to escape everyday hustle and bustle life. Easy to read. Fell in love with the characters.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|It was very interesting to watch the life of people with some king of mental disorder from a different prospective. Cute and emotional.
B00A3T5CGU|3.0|I'm not sure whether or not this is really the app that I wanted.  I will have to try making it work for me and then decide to keep or to delete it.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|My grandsons love this game.  They are 6 and 7 years old.  When they were through playing, I tried it too.  Even I had fun.  Simple and easy to play.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I downloaded this application for my little grandsons ages 2-1/2 and 5...they love it and tried to teach me all about it.  I've played it a few times but am not very good at it.
B009EBLCK8|5.0|If you thought the first season was awesome, the first episode to the last does not disappoint.  Simply an epic show!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Obviously, I'm very glad that I found and read the first 4 of Hugh Howey's Silo shorts stories. They were so good that I literally devoured them in two days. Then I discovered there was a book 5... but there was also a full length novel with a few changes in it... or I could read just book 5. Naturally, i chose to start over and read it all beginning to end with book 5 as the last major part of the novel. I loved every minute of it! Mr. Howey's characters are so rich but he writes themin a way that let's you get to know them bit by bit; just as you would in real life. The same is true of the Silo environment. It's very complex but it's not fed to you with whole pages of just description; you learn it as the characters live in it. I was so sorry when I got to the end. I wanted MORE. That's when I discovered that Hugh Howey allowed other writers to use his Silo story line much in the same way Marion Zimmer Bradley did with her Darkover novels. So, I'm thrilled to find that I have 2-3 weeks ahead of me reading prequels and sequels and new bits for the middle. And as I read the contributions from the other authors, I'll be sure to rate them as well.<br /><br />Would I recommend this author (Hugh Howey) and the Silo series? Absolutely, positively!!! It's been a very long time since someone invented a totally new sci-fi world. ENJOY!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. Somewhat challenging but never long before I find the next piece of the puzzle. Looking forward to more rooms to try.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I have only had this app for maybe a few months.... so far its impressing me so this is pretty cool for a free app...
B00005NKKZ|5.0|I believe I was a teenager when I first heard this album and I enjoy it very much.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone that likes their music.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|It was just as ordered...perfect.  The first disc gave us some trouble in the blue ray player but we had set our machine on the wrong setting so it wasn't the fault of the disc.
B008XX6J4C|4.0|I liked the music by The Piano Guys .  I listen to it a lot.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who would like that kind of music.
0307155102|5.0|This book is exactly what it says!  The best word book ever.  I raised my seven children on it and now all of my grandchildren are loving it.  The art work is great and engaging and keeps a child's attention.
B00C33M2EE|4.0|I liked the 2 albums of The Piano Guys and The Piano Guys 2 very much.  I have listened to both of them quite often.<br /><br />Headline:  The Piano Guys<br /><br />I heard the first song fromThe Piano Guys on the Huckabee Show.  That is how I found out about it.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|I read this book hoping for insight into how a successful woman balances her career and being a mom. That's definitely not what I got. It's clear that Sheryl Sandberg wants to believe that is what she does, but she doesn't. Her career is first and she spends the book explaining how she was able to continue her career even while she was a mother. It's like an outline of how to prevent motherhood from affecting your career, and how hard it can be but it can be done. I do like that she advocates for workplaces being more understanding of the plight of mothers and those with young children, and how paternity leave needs to be valued. Yet, it was kind of a manifesto of why you shouldn't feel guilty for being a working mom, even though she still seems to be. It was hard for me to get the clear message she was sending. I think it's about priorities - if you are working so much that you spend three or more nights away from home and you eat dinner with your children only a couple of times a week, then I think it's clear your priority is your job, not your children. She tries to dance a line making it seem like it's not the case, but if that's what it is, that's what it is.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|fansastic.....where are the rest of the seasons to follow?  you get so engrossed in the characters, they seem to be real.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I bought this book from more of the crime angle element of &#34;this guy's wife disappeared. What happened to her?&#34; Kind of like the Dateline type interest, but the book ended up being way more involved than a who dunnit. It's written in an interesting fashion with alternating voices from the two main characters, which is interesting. Without spoiling anything, there are several twists and turns. The book was a good read, it was just disturbing and I felt like I needed to take a shower after finishing with how dark things turn out.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|This game is fun for about, a minute! It's to simple, and has to many flaws! This game is not worth it!!!
B00555X8OA|5.0|This book is delight to read. We rarely see such a good combination of science, first person accounts, examples and take home messages to improve our perception and behavior. It is long, yes, but it flows, building the information to advance to the next chapters and repeating over and over the key messages.
B007SGM084|5.0|I. Loved it.  At 49  my love life is better.  We obviously are not into the practices of the book.  After all;  IT IS FICTION!
B002AWX6UM|3.0|I hear another book is coming out. I'm glad because I'm hoping it deals with how he was able to change and deal with the aftermath of war and all of the killing he witnessed and did. It just kind of ended in a sad depressing spot. I did appreciate the history. Such a senseless war. Killing without any real understanding of who is the enemy and what they were fighting. It's a real sin to use children in this way.
B001J1K5IG|5.0|This is a pretty good story of Wyatt Earp and his family!  I love westerns and I love movies like these!  It was a good movie.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I love this game. me and my son play it all the time. the online play is a nice touch.
B004P12SSW|5.0|you have to love musicals and singing!  I love them so I found it awesome!  Christina can really belt it out!
B002K0WBYG|5.0|Arrived on time and in great condition...this movie is funny and romantic all at the same time making it a great movie for men and women.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Continuation of a great first 2 seasons with ever present intrigue and interwoven plots.  Certainly keeps your interest and keeps tou on the edge of your seat
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great movie, action, comedy and drama with great actors. I highly recommend it. Hope that RED2 is just as good.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This read as well as most of David Baldacci's books was fantastic. From the fist paragraph to the last He keeps you guessing, drawing you into the plot, keeping you turning the pages! When that last paragraph is finished you want more, another captivating, intriguing, page turner.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This has been a favorite game of mine because it has good graphics with numerous options. I've been playing since July 2013 and spent a considerable amount of money buying chips because I enjoyed the game that much but I have to say they have the worst customer service. In the beginning if I had any problems with my purchase not loading I would contact them & they'd respond within 72 hours & fix it but then they became unresponsive. I bought $50 worth of chips that never loaded & they never responded. I sent in the purchase information but never heard from them & never received the credit though I sent numerous follow ups for several months until I finally gave up. Though I enjoy the game & still play I've never spent another penny. I go daily & get my free chips & save them up & play after I have a good pile. In the meantime I play other great bingo games for free. Buyer beware.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Was hard to set down. I love this book! Encourage all to read it at least once. It never gets old.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I have been reading books for years if you like military science fiction then you'll enjoy this book it doesn't drag like so many others
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|I like just doodling with this. It makes me take my mind off of other crazy things? You could probably do some really cool things, just have not tried.
B00B8M4IMK|2.0|I was looking forward to this purchase, so that my kids could charge their iPhones while I charge my Galaxy S3. But when I finally got to try it twice, we found that the port for Apple products doesn't work. And now I'm told the return period has expired, so I'm stuck with it anyway and still have to get another. Not easy to do on the little bit of Disability I get from Social Security every month on account of having cancer. Too bad, Amazon; I have come to expect good things of you and I'm disappointed that I can't at least exchange it for one that works!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I wish I had read the 1 star reviews before purchasing this book vs. relying on the overall rating. I am only a few chapters in and I'm going to have to lem this book. Thankfully it was an inexpensive purchase on the Kindle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much and u don't there something wrong with u so people that don't have this game d download it
B000MZHW40|4.0|The more I see of Leonardo DiCaprio, the more impressed I am with his acting ability. From What's Eating Gilbert Grape to this movie and others, his acting ability continuously surprises me. When I really first saw him in Titanic, I thought he was another adolescent girls dream. But with subsequent viewing of various movies I now appreciate his acting ability.<br />To cut it short and save the plot for others to see, in Blood Diamond, he essentially plays a soldier of fortune who succumbs to the nobler aspects of humanity by helping another person. By the movie’s end, you see that he is tied to Africa not only by situation but by his being. He is who he is and Africa will always be in him. Great acting by him (with accent) and his co-lead, Djimon Hounsou. I even thought that Jennifer Connelly was good as well- at times a bit over the top, but good none the less. Entertaining movie, would recommend.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The only thing that keeps this from 5 stars is the ads.  But the ads are minor and the game is everything you want.
B00DU74U74|4.0|Realize this review is from someone who is a sucker for Sci-fi. I also like movies with a new twist, which this had. Put those two together, with some decent acting & storyline, & you've got a winner in my book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I bought this for my daughter but quickley took it over like most games I find. it is fun and interactive. diamonds are spendy though
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Would rate it higher if there were more stars. There is something there for everyone: scenery, costume, superb acting, story line, relationships, all done with good taste and proper language. The interaction between aristocratic society and their servants is interesting and educational for the time periods depicted. All in all, very entertaining and engaging of mind and emotions with the characters.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|The two and one half year old lives The Avengers once the Hulk appears. The first 15 to 20 minutes is slow for the younger viewers.
B00AYQNOFI|4.0|Wow, what an adventure this movie was. The sights just had impact at every turn from total delight to morbid. It is one of those movies that affords you to experience a wide range of emotions and perspective on the world.
B00AB0NTTI|4.0|My mom suggested that our family watch this movie, since it contains some catch phrases my uncles say.  It's old but still hilarious. Anyone looking for something funny and different from what is out today should give this a try.  You'll like it.
B0044IABFS|4.0|This series keeps you on your toes. Once you start watching you just keep going. Just one you think things are going good the writer throws you a curve ball.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Quartet is a cute movie, and I love all the actors, but it gets bogged down in places.  I had expected a bit more singing, but overall, it's a good movie.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I'm an avid fan of the Good Wife.  Unfortunately I didn't start seeing if from the beginning and I just wanted to get up to speed.  I mostly missed the first few episodes, ok maybe most of the first season. But now I understand some of the players and most of the game!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a feel good movie, the characters are all likable, and the plot moves along nicely.  The minions are great, and so is Agnes is too.
B000WQW988|5.0|Love it!.. just need it in blu-ray ;) ......I haven't seen this since me young teenage years and with a new respect for music. I love it a hundred time more
B006JD48NM|5.0|This is the true documentary of Ayrton Senna, possibly the best F1 driver of all time.  This story shows the struggles and the victories of this young Brazilian.  The cinematography is excellent and there is not a slow point in the film.  If you like F1 or auto racing, you will for sure enjoy it.  If you wanted to see what the life of a pro race driver is like, this should show you!
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Pretty freaky. We enjoyed watching it. It was worth the watch. It had some take you by surprise scary moments.
B00BOXZAG6|4.0|Their is no doubt Upside Down is a genuine marvel to look at. The story itself is your archetypical tale akin Romeo & Juliet with a sci-fi edge thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The 3D is a step behind the rest of the movie however,which is a crying shame. Don't get me wrong,the 3D is decent,but theirs so many missed opprotunities it really left me scratching my head. For instance,this film has quiet a few moments were we see a lot of snow,yet it's never given a pop out 3D treatment. Watch the Imax 3D film \\"Rescue\\" and then compare it's snow effects with Upside Down. Their is none. The best supplement the 3D offers is it seems to really compliment the cold and isolated feel of the movie itself. I definitely think the 3D adds a certain amount of look to the film,it's just I saw so much potential unfulfilled.<br /><br /> In conclusion Upside Down offers us nothing new in terms of the timeless love story,but it does place it in a very strangely beautiful setting,and I kept thinking about the film after I watched it,so it's very apparent something about it stuck with me.<br />It's worth at the very least a rental,but at it's cheap price (20 dollars at walmart and 15 at Target in my area) you can't go wrong purchasing it for your library either.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|Watched it last night, was worth the watch - had all the things we look for in a scary movie, was more gory than scary to me though.
6305212112|5.0|Everyone can relate in some way to this movie if you have ever had that one friend in your life that you went through everything with and the bonds that keep you together no matter what.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Love it, great songs and great vibe to the music.  All of the songs are good!  You should have this album
B007J4T2G8|5.0|From someone who had little knowledge of this lifestyle before hand, this was certainly a captivating look at it.  Sometimes I was saying &#34;awww&#34; and sometimes my mouth was just hanging open in shock...which to me is a great read!  Of course the characters are unbelievably perfect, but in a book that deals with subject matter this intense I was ok with it. Can't wait for the movie!
0312430000|2.0|Not exactly what I expected when I ordered this book.  Would be a good book for someone in the medical field.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Another entertaining look into this story. I enjoyed it, even though the over the top wealth and perfection of all the characters is a bit much. I was frustrated this book didn't wrap up the story, but still wanted answers at the end.
B0058DRTGC|5.0|One of the best books I've read on the subject.  Thanks about the differences between Good to Great for the business world and how those principles must change for nonprofits.  Excellent advice that will probably make you reconsider how you develop and recruit volunteers, hone your strategy, and develop your plans.  I've recommended this book to pastors and leaders/executives of all kinds of nonprofit groups.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Still a story that captivated in the beginning, but by this point I didn't feel it had much new to offer except for tying up loose ends. I did enjoy the twist near the end, and my OCD made sure I finished it, but I didn't feel it drew me in like the first two.  Worth reading if you have read and enjoyed the other two though, if for no other reason than to get your questions answered.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I've been using the updated version for a few weeks now and I have to say I still don't care for it. My &quot;default&quot; location is incorrect (no matter what I do to change it), the home screen is way too busy, and it crashes a lot. I'm all for taking time to get used to something new but this time it didn't matter - I still don't like it.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I purchased this album for my Mother as I already had a copy. She loves the music. Not a bad track on the album
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I ordered mine directly from Google and got it last weekend.  A breeze to setup, and really slick to use from either of my Android tablets.  The only negative at this point is that it only supports Netflix and Youtube, although support for other services will be forthcoming.  It would be nice to see Amazon Prime support but that obviously isn't going to happen because Amazon wants you to buy into their closed tablet ecosystem.<br /><br />Once gripe that is not related to the product.  Something like 40 nitwits had already reviewed this product before it was even released, based on nothing but their like or dislike of Google.  Get a life you fools and don't review anything unless you have actually used the product.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is so much fun! I have beaten the entire game, but I still play it all the time! Basically, anyone who plays it will become addicted to it. I love this app because it keep you occupied and I love how the whole game is set up, but then I hate it because I have to keep playing it!
B000B8QG22|5.0|I do not normally watch movies made about Vietnam, especially those that question our involvement in that conflict, because I lived it.  However, Good Morning, Vietnam, like MASH of the Korean War, looks at the conflict from a different point of view with a great deal of humor.  And still it portrays the types of people the GI/Sailor came in contact with and also had to put up with, while attempting to get his job done.  Of course, Robin Williams is always good, and this movie was made to order for his antics and humor.  The 12 minutes of dialog in his first radio broadcast are Robin at his best.  I highly recommend this movie even to people who opposed our involvement in Vietnam.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game was very fun and addicting...until the recent update. It will not load past the introduction anymore on the Kindle Fire, so I can no longer play it. If they fix the bugs, then it'll definitely be worth your time.
B00BX3KZAS|5.0|In your face loud, fast, obnoxious heavy metal!  Love it!  I don't usually like a keyboardist in metal music, but I make an exception here.  This is well thought out, nasty metal at its best.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|At first I didn't think I would like this camera but the more I work with it, I find it is a good camera.  It takes good pictures.  You just have to get adjusted to how to take the pictures.  It's not as easy as a pad.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Saw Vintage trouble supporting the WHO.<br />Brilliant performance .<br />Bought Bomb Shelter o the strength of the performance .<br />Great modern take on Atlantic/ Stax style .
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love this calculator.  It is readily available and makes it easy on the eyes.  I find when I use it other people want to use it because it's good for this senior eyes.  They'll put theirs down and use mine.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Very good read!! It was hard to put it down. Cant wait for the next book, although i havent seen the release date for it :(
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is so easy to use so I can get to my emails.  It pulls them right up and in my spare time away from home I can get emails read instead of waiting until I get home.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|Very entertaining video. I look forward to seeing the sequel now that it has come out in theaters this summer.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I use this calculator a lot in the kitchen.  I run a soup kitchen once a week and it comes in handy with recipes.  Not only there but at home in the kitchen also.
B004P7CNE0|5.0|ACTION: 5/5<br />ACTING:  5/5<br />STORY:  3/5<br />BELIEVABILITY 1/5<br /><br />No matter what it is like 100% better than movies made today!
055358202X|2.0|What do you get if you remove pretty much all of the interesting characters from the series, as well all the mystical \\"Ice and Fire\\" aspects, and replace them instead with over-analysis of characters you don't like and a bunch of random people you don't care about?  This pile of crap.<br /><br />After the riveting third book, this one scarcely could've been more of a letdown.  I had friends advising me to just skip this book entirely, and other reviews on here advising to skip most of the chapters.  Really, that's what you should do, skip all or most of this book.  Seriously, there's no more than handful of chapters in this book that are worth reading, and for the rest, you should just read a synopsis online.<br /><br />Here's what you have in store for you:  (Yes, I left out the one or two things in this book that could constitute a spoiler.)<br /><br />Cersei takes up the majority of the book.  In case you ever wanted to know the inner workings of the despicable queen's mind, boy is this the book for you!  I admit, her first couple chapters were interesting just to see what happens in King's Landing after the events of Book 3, but it soon gets very repetitive.  She's paranoid of everyone and surrounds herself with a bunch of minions she can control.  What does that mean?  No more interesting characters on the small council, just a bunch of boring lackeys you care nothing about.  However, something very important happens in her last chapter, and I really enjoyed reading that one.<br /><br />Jamie is one of the less boring characters in this book, but still does almost nothing plot-wise until the very end.  Yes, he evolves into a more honorable character.  Neat, I guess.  Also, he continues to debate whether he wants to continue porking his sister, as she debates the same about him.  An incestuous soap opera, yay!  Overall though, his chapters aren't too bad to read.<br /><br />Brienne's chapters are the most pointless crap in the entire series.  I skipped all of them except for the last two.  For literally dozens of pages, all she does is wander asking random people if they've seen Sansa Stark.  That's it.  Skip all of these for sure.  I can't believe an editor didn't tell Martin to just cut these out.  Some stuff finally happens to her in her last two chapters, just read those.<br /><br />Then you have the Stark girls, who are not given nearly enough space, with only 3 chapters a piece.  If you're waiting for Arya to turn into a cool assassin chick like I am, keep waiting longer.  Her chapters are okay and worth reading, but her character doesn't progress very far.  Sansa, who was probably the most boring character in the series before, is now actually one of the least boring in this book.  Her chapters are worth reading, but again, she doesn't progress very far.<br /><br />Samwell's chapters are definitely worth reading.  He's a likable enough guy, despite his cowardice, and some plot actually happens in his story.  Granted, even that is more of a set-up for stuff to come.<br /><br />What does that leave?  A bunch of random nameless characters.  Half are from Dorne, the other half are Greyjoys.  I actually found the stuff in Dorne to be rather interesting, (even though at first you're like \\"wait, who? what?), and I would recommend reading these for sure.  But again, there's not nearly enough of it.  You're left disappointed halfway through the book, then there's not another chapter from them until close to the very end.  The Greyjoy stuff is really boring at first, and I didn't really care about any of them.  Again, just read their last two chapters.<br /><br />The main people in this book take way too long to get to anywhere, and spend way too much time just walking around talking to random people you don't care about.  You could say they're overdeveloped.  On the other hand, the minor characters (or those who used to main characters, i.e. the Stark girls) and the Dorne people are underdeveloped, and don't progress nearlyfar enough.  And of course, as I mentioned, all the best characters and all the magic is missing.  This book is an unbelievable disappointment.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|This app is really only suittable for the much larger level numbers. It makes it appear as if it will help you navigate through understanding the game better. In reality, it should specify that it is not very useful until you get into the 200 and 300 levels.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What can I say. Try it, You're going to hate it and love it. But don't take my word for it… just read what the swiss have to say! &#60;a href='link goes here'&#62;great review!</a>
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Can be frustrating at time but definitely keeps you thinking and makes you want to escape the room. Can be very addicting.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|All the family detail was intricate and fun to see with realistic problems included.  Actors were great....I would recommend this to anyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Addicting game that you'll find yourself playing much longer than you originally planned! I like the way you have to reach goals, gives you something to work towards.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I love the think and rethink .  Lots of fun alone or with a group  also educational for my grand and great grand children. graphics are simple colorful and pleasing to all ages. Some tools like putty knife could use some explanation. But I'm sure we will figure it out and in the meantime fun fun fun try and try again too tough take a break come back later success is always possible . And celebrated on arrival.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I am addicted to watching this show.  My family knows when I'm watching this on my iPad, I am oblivious to anything going on around me.<br />The characters are people I would love to know.  It's all very &#34;pretty&#34; and not real, but at the same time, the interactions, emotions and problems are very real.  The resolution of these problems don't conveniently end easily, or in one episode.  And, there is a bit of ghosts for fun although the moral of the story is serious.  This is a show of characters, relationships and a lot of love that is refreshing and interesting.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Robot stopped me cold but I am getting better love the challenge. Recommend for keeping my brain young at 70 years old the perfect  mental exercise  to share with my grand and great grand children. I win some I lose some and the rest are set for rematch.  End less fun no further purchase required
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I think EVERYONE should read this book.  It can help in other relationships as well as romantic ones.  It's about learning to see through anothers' eyes... how to make them feel loved and appreciated-and in turn- they'll do the same.  Sounds simple, right?  It is.  And this book really helps you over the hump of trying something new.  Read it!
B00AHJL7BK|3.0|Need more time to play concept still escapes me but I love Suzuki so I am expecting progress soon I think I let myself  get frustrated too easily. So jury is still out PLAN play again before placing in the cloud
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Enjoyed watching The Avengers, it was good to see the super heroes working together to save the world. The special effects were not too out there
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|Find it harder the I remembering my last kindle fire 1st generation' plan to keep practicing and comparing to gen email that is factory installed on my new 2nd generation device
B003IDMUVI|5.0|Be ready to forget everything for the next whole day, when you start reading this one! Loved the passive voice narrative in first person, using mostly present tense. Unusual but likable!
B0020BUWX2|3.0|I sampled this book and loved the first couple of chapters so I bought the book.  The concept was great but the execution was a little slow.  The author tries to write from the perspective of a an 18 year old and at some times it seems forced.  Also, the 7 year old in the book constantly makes witty and thoughtful remarks which is completely unrealistic.<br /><br />The chapters switch back and forth from the girl's perspective while she's in a coma to flashbacks of life with her family- all of which revolve around music.  I was a little bored with the constant music/band references because it doesn't interest me. As I got further along I thought &#34;this book isn't very good but I have to keep reading just to find out what decision she makes&#34;. Finally, I get to the end... and it just ends. Disappointing ending- no real explanation.<br /><br />All-in-all the book was interesting, and I will probably see the movie, but it's not something I would read again.
B0007PAMEM|5.0|I can't imagine any Tina Turner fan not having this DVD.  It is truly a great compilation of all her greatest performances.
B00CM9JKQM|3.0|After all the hype that this album received, I expected a lot more.  I realize I'm in the minority regarding this album but there isn't one track on here that grabs me and makes me want to listen to it over and over again.  I've listened to this album multiple times and nothing on it stands out.  It sounds to me like a bunch of re-recorded songs that didn't make the cut on prior releases.  Todd LaTorre sounds great and he seems like an excellent addition to the band.  Maybe this album is the springboard that'll make the next Queensryche album a great one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Bored and looking to pass time? Play Solitaire!! I can't get enough =) it's kind of an addiction. I play random deal and if I don't win I can't stop (it's a good thing this isn't poker LOL!)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games EVER to play. I like all of the characters in the game. All of the features are outstanding to me! I hope you will like this game!  :)
159562015X|3.0|The book did not describe that it included the test. I paid extra for the test later to find a passcode within. The book have given me better grasp of activities that I already do and since I usually don't give myself enough credit to do MORE, MORE, MORE. The book will help you look at positive parts of your life.
B005HSL626|5.0|It is so fun to play. I sometimes play it whenever I can. It is just so fun. I hope everybody else likes it!  :D
0061906220|3.0|I was super excited to get this book for my daughter's birthday based on other reviews. It isn't anything spectacular, but a decent book. We read it a couple times after she got it, but hasn't asked for it since.
B00CCEHX5W|5.0|Learning how to drink martinis takes time.  It is possible that the first sip will be spit out as it overwhelms your senses.  It is harsh.  It is intense.  It burns.  Gradually, you learn (with eyes closed), to choke down a gulp or two.  It is strong.  It makes you strong.  The taste and immediate effects become warm and familiar.  Eventually, you begin to savor every drop...and crave the next one.<br /><br />I love martinis.  Buy this album.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Wasn't a fan of the trilogy but its quite good and I'm interested in seeing the next one. I thought it would be bloody or sad because of the children dying theme but it was edited well and you don't get that feeling from it. Jennifer Lawrence really is an exceptional actress. The movie would've been lame if she wasn't so good at bringing you into the story.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|My laptop crashed and I had to buy a new one and when I went to pull the song off the cloud for my new laptop to play it off line I could not do it. Very unhappy.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I don't play this but my grandkids love it. Very good purchase. They play till my battery goes dead or bedtime, which ever comes first.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|If you saw the movie the book will surprise you -- it's not a bit like the movie.  This book reads like the day after World War III techno books.  Some good stories here.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it! Would totally recommend on getting this game especially if you loved the movie. Loved the levels they have to incorporate both movies.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|What can I say?  If you're a Supernatural fan, then Season 8 will not disappoint.  I play softball several nights a week and wasn't able to watch the episodes when they aired.  Thanks to my Roku, however, I caught up quickly and was left with goosebumps and a &#34;Oh man!  I have to wait to see what happens now!&#34;  feeling.  Good stuff!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This is the most intense TV show ever (never had a chance to see the Sopranos, though.  Maybe that was its equal.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Just starting the SoA journey via my Roku.  Aside from the &#34;JC&#34; and &#34;GD&#34; language, this show has definitely gotten under my skin (in a good way) and I plan to watch at least one episode per night until I catch up.  This show is like the Sopranos of the MC world.  Very addicting!
B00846REIS|5.0|Great love novel and great read! Enjoyed the book and thought this trilogy is better and fifty shades of grey.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Having been a long time Firefly fan, I always wondered why it ended. The show was great and too many loose ends were left unresolved. Serenity did a great job of answering all of the lingering questions and left the door open for more to come.<br />If you never watched Firefly, this is a great stand alone move also! Think wild wild west in space. You have to love it.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|My shoes arrived after conflicting emails from Amazon  They were to small,  so I read your directions  and sent the shoes back.  I requested a larger size.  I sent them back in the mail. I understand that I will be responsible for the postage, and I am not too happy about this. And.  if they don't fit again and  I need another pair,  I  cannot  spend any more money for  postage, I will probably not try to purchase items from Amazon on the Internet.  Too costly?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I really miss this show. It had something for everyone, cowboys in space, heavy thinkers, special abilities, eye candy for the men and women, a believable plot with great writing.<br />Now I can get my Firefly fix anytime I want to.
B000002VCQ|5.0|Great singer who will be missed and a great CD! I plan on getting all her CD'S in the near future.
B00APACSJG|5.0|I have enjoyed the entire series and hope for more.  This would make an excellent movie or TV series.  Bujold is an amazing writer.
0062255657|4.0|this book is a careful journey to Gaiman's universe. it might be shadowed by bigger and bolder works like American Gods, but it is still a treasured volume in my book shelf.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|enjoyed the movie and the intricacies of how much he had to go to free his wife from enslavement.  Some scenes were rather gorry but understandable as far as subject matter.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|If you like his other books, you'll probably like this too.  Not super cheery, but certainly makes me happy I was born into the life I have.  Which I guess makes it cheery in its own way . . .
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've tried several klondike solitaire apps. This one is 'hands-down' the best. Lots of feature, good clear graphics and seamlessly smooth. It is a total pleasure to use.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|My kids wanted me to download this.  They love it.  I play once in a while.  It's pretty fun if you have nothing better to do.
B00338CMTI|4.0|Really enjoyed this sequel to the hunger games. A few twists to the plot. Leisurely read. Good vacation book. Enjoy
1451627297|4.0|Though flawed, this book may resonate deeply with some-- anyone with more than a history lesson connection to the JFK assassination and the zeitgeist of that time, anyone who has ever wished to \\"go back\\" and re-invent themselves and find the love or meaning missing from their lives.<br /><br />There is something very mature and philosophical about the voice of this story, though the main character often did not strike me as that of a present day 35 year old trying to adjust to the late fifties/early sixties time period.  Rather, he struck me as a 65 year old reminiscing about going back to the days when he was 35, but perhaps this added to the authenticity behind the loss and longing evident in the main character.  And perhaps because I wasn't around to remember those days and be caught up with JFK, I wasn't entirely sold on why the story's two time travelers would dedicate themselves so completely and for so many years to the cause of preventing the assassination--at such great peril.<br />Yet as part political thriller, this was still interesting and mostly a page turner. It could have been edited down a bit.  Definitely too long and too slow in parts.<br /><br />As part personal story and love story, there were many scenes I just loved reading--even the over-the-top ones (the part of the high school play seemed more like wish fulfillment but I was swept away just the same). The very final scene which, though not unexpected, was bittersweet and poetic.  Sigh.<br /><br />As far as the time travel premise, this is a fairly typical butterfly-effect kind of story.  The question isn't would you change the past if it were possible, but should you change the past if it were possible?  I can only think of one story that didn't answer this question in the negative and without leading to catastrophic results.  At this level, this story takes no risks and offers no new perspectives/conclusions to the already existing time-travel/butterfly-effect stories out there.  Look further if you are looking for cutting-edge sci-fi.<br />Overall, a good story.  I wavered between 3.5 stars and 4 and decided on 4.
B008JFUNYG|3.0|This was just okay for me, it was a lame attempt at scary but failed miserably. I thought it was going to be way better than it was and I was not disappointed because it lived up to my thoughts. If you are looking for scary this in my opinion will not get it. It was just gory and bloody but not scary. I know that this was a remake but it was a failed attempt at scary and true horror movie.
0938045768|5.0|Throughout all my life, I was plagued by sports injuries. And most of these injuries happened after pushing a little bit hard, even if I've been training for a while and even after a good warm-up. Also, after doing some exercises and instead of feeling refreshed and revived, I felt depleted.<br /><br />I always wondered why and I couldn't find the answer. I knew I was doing something wrong, but I didn't know what.<br />When I was pumping iron, I stopped because of a shoulder injury.<br />When I was practicing Karate, I stopped because of bad knees and because I felt exhausted after a training.<br />When I tried training at home with rubber bands, I injured my elbows (golfer's elbow where the inner part of the elbow joints hurt like hell) so I stopped.<br /><br />I stumbled on this book by pure coincidence and boy this was one of the best coincidences in my life. I finally discovered what I was doing wrong:<br />I was pushing myself to the limit before letting my body adapt gradually. I wanted to get gains now. I was impatient.<br /><br />What this book taught me is being patient and evolve gradually. And here lies the secret. You should go through all the steps laid out in this book no matter how easy they appear to you.<br />Doing standing push ups against the wall? When I first red this I wanted to laugh. Me? I was doing 80 reps of full push ups!! I should start by this easy exercise? The answer is YES, yes and yes. You should let your body adapt slowly.<br /><br />I hope that everyone who wants to feel better and be stronger discovers this book as it changed my life and it changed my view about training.<br />Forget about all you've been taught about how to train and get this book. This is the real deal.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I think it is good but think u should be able to by diffrent minons.  I ushaly don't get adictad but I did I recommend it see dispicable me in theators
B00A285OOW|5.0|I hate when they end and I have to wait for the next one. I love all of her books.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I live it. I can not get off of this game I think it is good for taking car trips I love it.  it is heady time filling
B00AALX5SI|4.0|This wasn't on my list of movies to see, but I happened upon it and watched out of curiousity....and I like it!  I was a very different perspective of Katy's life and her work.  She is very talented and fun.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love this game. If you liked Dungeon Hunter 3, then you will be thrilled with this. The gameplay format has changed some but I truly think it's all for the better. There are now main storyline quests which have dungeons that you can roam part of then also there are the memorable wave 1,2, and 3 areas.. You can finally sell old equipment! They have updated the classes slightly. Finally you can now not only update your stuff but create slots for gem powerups. Love. It.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I really enjoy this app! It was the free app of the day today so I picked it up. I can't stay off of it! I have been an instrumentalist for nearly 20 years so I knew what a good part of the options would do. I created one and saved it. The only thing I don't like with it is yes I can e-mail myself the recording but nothing can play it that I have found thus far. Hopefully I will soon assuming I can find a converter to make it into mp3 I could. Other then that, I'm impressed!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I laughed almost the entire way through. All the characters are funny in their own way. The only thing I dislike are the scenes with barfing and/or projectile vomiting. I really could have done without that part, thanks! But aside from that, the dialogue is witty and well timed and the songs are cute and catchy. Good story with a blow out ending. Awesome!!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Rented the movie to spend an evening relaxing while performing reserve duty and thoroughly enjoyed it.  A good action flick.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Tegan and Sara are on of my top three music groups ever, and this new album does not disappoint. I know the girls were going for a more pop sounding or mainstream album, but it definitely has a lot of the T+S quirk that I love. I listen to it over and over and over, and so will you.
B00C90T4QK|4.0|I love all of his original songs on this album and oh what a voice!  But there is a larger than desired percentage of remade songs which are still good but not great. A few duo's on this dish that are pretty good too.  All in all worth the purchase. Especially since you can listen to it anywhere.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just like owning and competing with real horses. My 4 year old loves it and wants to name all the horses herself.
B0053O89WY|5.0|If you don't laugh, then I don't know what would make you laugh.  The character interaction, dialog and situations are hilarious.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Jack Reacher would've made one helluva Clint Eastwood movie. Unfortunately it stars Tom Cruise. While a fine action star in his own right, Cruise normally comes off as adventurous rather than tough. He tries hard to make up for the difference here by playing the role with a poker face and in a bad mood but it looks like acting from scene one.
B007N85POS|4.0|Fun to play and challenging too.  A nice change from pigs only.  I am having fun and so are my grandchildren.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins wrote another exciting adventure in the Sigma Force Series.  I love how he using real things that seem too made up to be real, but then explains what is real and where he researched those things.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very fun game. Definitely sucked me in right away but as other players have mentioned I wish that the coins regenerated faster for more playing without having to wait. I don't know  what level I'm on but i'm not high enough to have unlimited coins yet. But great fun game just wish there were more ways to earn coins faster

B001HN6EF4|5.0|My children love to play uno with their friends while at swim meets and these cards are perfect for little wet hands, when I swam we would ruin packs of cards every swim meet. They shuffle well but can get sticky, but then they can be washed with a little dish soap to clean them back up.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Wish that there was more acorns then the ones you give us so you do more things with. Very good game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So much better then I expected. Compelling, intelligent, riveting, down right addicting. I couldn't put it down and now I can't wait to read book two. This is not a good book for teens it's a great book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I hope Season 4 is as good as the first three.  I really enjoy watching this show. I just hope no other cast member leaves so soon so that no one else has to die.
0062082353|5.0|I think this book was great. chris  tells his story well and its exciting. easy to real and cool. it will have you saying go navy.
B004G0SJU8|5.0|City of Angels is one of my favorite movies after Pride and Prejudice, the music is awesome (own the soundtrack) and the stories its heart warming and moving, the ending always brings me to tears.
B00017LSK8|1.0|But the pictures all failed, no matter what I tried -- all black with vague outlines of the subject matter. The settings were correct, the rollers were clean, and it didn't matter what exposure time I tried.
B003KIIXWQ|4.0|Who would think that Burt, and Clint would make a comedy team? If you like Burt, and or Clint I recommend this movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is one that required some late nights to finish.  Couldn't stop reading once I had started.  Will seek out this author again...
B007IK44CK|4.0|Action with Humor along the way. Tom Cruise does an excellent job as usual with the mission impossible movies. If you like action, you'll like this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|very clear picture quality,good sound, cheap watching, very fast streaming.Was awesome to be able to watch all of it so easily
B005LAII4E|1.0|***contains some spoilers***<br />Ok, I love the Rock and I grew up on GI Joe.  The first movie was good, likable characters, over the top action, character chemistry, etc.  I really looked forward to this sequel, but boy was I disappointed!  Yes, there's a lot of action and big explosions...but the Joe characters from the first movie are all absent, minus Channing Tatum, WHO IS KILLED IN THE FIRST 20 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE!  I understand what they were going for, Roadblock needed to be set up as the new leader of the Joes.  But come on, how can they kill off Duke!?!?  And where are the rest of the Joes from the first movie?  I missed the one liners from Mr. Wayons.  I loved Scarlett's kick butt attitude.  I think what most bothered me about this movie (and there were a lot if things) is that it is a 'sequel' that has basically turned into a totally different movie.  There was a lack of chemistry with the actors and a beyond ridiculous story.  I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life and $3.99 renting it.  I say, don't bother!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I truly have not had the time to finish this book.  The beginning was good.  I hope to be able to finish it soon.
B000EWD1KK|5.0|This is an all time favorite of mine. The print is great. A fun movie full of Danny Kaye's zaniness.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A combination of haves and have nots with historic drama tied in. A show that you wish would keep coming. Cant wait for season 4
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't wait to see what happens next...this book kept me awake and thinking what comes next...can't wait for the next book to come out
B003BWERF8|5.0|Works exactly as stated! Took my iPod classic and made it bluetooth ready in seconds. Wonderful accessorie, awesome, just awesome!
B00E6D4HHO|5.0|I love the set, definitely going to pick it up, but it seems that its missing the X-Men trilogy bonus discs and Wolverine in 3D. It'd be better if it at least had the spots in the case for the bonus discs. I already own the trilogy bonus content, but now I have to keep those as well as this set. The larger issue is that it doesn't come with Wolverine 3D, so now I have to buy that as well. Tank you for the nice display case, but curse you for messing with me for making me buy twice and having discs all over my house.
0062124293|5.0|I love this book. It's written how she speaks and such a great insight to all the things women don't normally want to share or talk about.
B00E4W40C4|5.0|I went to see this already being a big fan of the past X-Men films, though I was upset with X3 and Singers departure as well as the cheesy nature of the last Wolverine film. This new Wolverine film had me at the edge of my seat the entire time. I get bored fast with films, being a screenwriter as well as filmmaker, I can usually foresee the entire film. Star Trek was okay but a let down for me, Man of Steel felt like it had too much endless action, Iron Man 3 felt forced at times, The Wolverine though was the highlight of the summer for me. I found myself lost inside the narrative, and as great films do, forgot that I was in a theater watching a film and simply experienced the film. Of course this film was made by the same director as the new 3:10 to Yuma, and Walk the Line, so if you enjoyed those films, you'll probably like this one. This film is a great character bridge also from X3 and into X-men Days of Future past, which releases next year. It's not directly connected, but presents Wolverines transition as a lost soul to finding a purpose. The only things you really need to k ow about X-Men to watch this film is that at the end of X3 he killed a woman he loved because she was killing others and lost control of her powers, he had his bones covered in an industrucible metal, and that Wolverine has a healing power and has also been alive for about 200 years.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As of now (Aug 5, 2013), it has limited functionality (casting from YouTube, Chrome Tab, Netflix, Media player). Works simply great.<br /><br />As soon as possible, Google should add screen-cast feature like Airplay.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is a must get app. As soon I got this app I was up at night playing until midnight. I play at least 4 times a day. I loves the different maps and costumes. This is my favorite app and you must get it
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Seems to be more focused on selling additional stuff  versus letting the user play the game.  Didn't even let my grandson see it, even with parental controls.
0618871713|5.0|Can see myself re-reading this periodically.  It is that good!  The superb writing coupled with the people's expressions in Bechdel's art work convey a lot of what isn't being said too.  Gay or straight this book will be a revelation to you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's great for people like me who can't have real horses. It's really fun to be able to interact and care for the !

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Because you know the outcome of these books (Jack Reacher<br />will live to ride again) the drama must be well done.  Reacher<br />is like an outlier, the mysterious stranger who comes into<br />our lives, and then disappears, hiking away on America's<br />highways. His trip is always a good one.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This game was awesome but since the update it will not open. It is stuck on the loading page. Please fix it!!!!!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|lots of fun. just challenging enough but not so hard that I want to give up. would recommend itnto anyone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I recommend it to anyone I couldn't put it down read it in a day an a half great author
B005QMOZOO|2.0|It's hard to write a sequel to a classic novel of the standard of Pride &Prejudice and capture the same unique feel established by the author. The story on its own was not a bad read, but where it fell down for me was that I kept drawing parallels to the original characterisations that did not meet my expectations of Elizabeth and Darcy. It was written in a style of someone who is familiar with the period but doesn't grasp the subtleties. The connections between the characters was already established so if the reader knew the original the author had little work to do in establishing her story, it was a lazy approach from someone who is a talented writer but instead of using her imagination to create a family of her own to thrust into the fictional limelight, she used one who had an established following.
B001KMB6X2|2.0|dont see why it couldnt work for ps3 says need to update blu ray player. a blu ray should be able to take all blu ray disks not just certain standard ones like this as it doesnt state what standard it is? put me off buying blu rays and will stick to dvds.<br />note this is for the blu ray edition i wrote on the dvd version by mistake
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This is not of course the typical western, but that does not detract from it at all.  Very entertaining flick, I would not say that Jamie Foxx portrayed his role as well as others might, but maybe no one else wanted to be strung up naked upside down.
B00AG473GE|5.0|Love this movie, it came on time, in perfect condition. I am satisfied with my purchase.
B0064J6OMO|3.0|In general, a few laughs, but you spend most of the time waiting for it to end. And don't get me started on the women in the movie who show some skin!
B0053TWW1I|5.0|I've been searching for this movie everywhere.... seen it when I was younger. Found it here, great price, excellent condition, I love it... thank you so much
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game.  Really made you think. I am looking forward to further adventures in the game of The Room.!!!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Near perfect game, though they should allow you to add friends if you don't have a Facebook. Even if you do, they should still make it so we can play with ppl we've just met. That'll make it even better. Nonetheless, good game.
B002N2SYAG|5.0|Another awesome season. Can't wait to start watching season 6. Love love love the cast, especially Dr. Brennan and Booth.  They have great chemistry.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A fun little game to compete against friends or alone.  Very addictive record keeping and best of all its actually free.  Minions are cool.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|Almost as good as the book, but not quite.  The story has the same flavor, but some of the best parts are skipped in the movie due to the limited time.  Movie goers can't be bothered with thinking, or nuances.... Just give them their 2 hours, and let them loose.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a fun game. I watched my friend play this game oh her phone and i thought i would be fun to play. And so when i found it on amazon i downloaded it and fell in love with the game. And if your board and want to pass time away this is the game to do that. It is really addicting. :D have fun with this game.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I've always regretted that I never seen the Bee Gees live. This video shows them at their best<br />doing all their hits and more. After watching One Night Only, I felt I had finally seen the Bee Gees live.

8866135887|5.0|I recommend the hardcover, they tend to last longer, but it is all up to preferences! Overall, this is a fabulous planner.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|All around good movie, maybe a bit over the top in a few parts but in the grand scheme of things it's no big deal.

030746363X|2.0|A book by the author of \\"The Four Hour Workweek\\", this is a deceptively simple yet DIFFICULT diet for the average person to handle. The author is not a doctor, nutritionist or certified in any way, to my understanding. What he is is a human guinea pig - on himself. It's an entertaining read: no nonsense, packed with his own research (and some of it credibly backed up by those doctors, athletes and other experts he's consulted) and delivered in a boot camp/drill sergeant kind of way, but with humor. It's a HUGE book. I got the hardcover edition. He advises you SPECIFICALLY to NOT read it cover-to-cover. You are encouraged to skip around and only read the chapters that, in your own assessment, will get you started right away. That total is about 150 pages at most. He drives home that results are quick, but there are some things you MUST do or you WILL fail. There are testimonials galore, and while that gave me much hope, I haven't been able to stick to it. The diet is EXTREMELY restrictive. You have 3 categories of foods to choose from, and not a broad range of things in those categories. The \\"cheat day\\" - one day in the week that you can binge - (you are encouraged to go all out -really pig out), I agree will keep you sane, but around week 3 I just couldn't go back to eating the restrictive phase the next day.  I'd lost 4 pounds in that time. I only had about 10 more to go. I had buddied up with a friend, who got me into it after trying it for over a month, and she couldn't stick to it either. The fault lies within me of course. I think this book works for people who have oodles of time, don't work outside the home (or who are either willing to prepare all their meals for work OR find a lunch place that will completely customize your meal) and have a metric ton of will power.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After reading fifty shades of grey, I was honestly a little disappointed. Lots of sex, no plot, and several badly written phrases over and over. But the second book was a great catapult. Fifty Shades Freed is an excellent read. Sure, there's the usual fights, the sex scenes, and Ana's constant nagging. But once they stop having sex for five minutes, the plot gets really good. Lots of twists and revelations. Great way to end the series. I honestly wish they wouldn't make a movie. It'll either be rated NC 17 and basically porn, or so severely edited it won't do it justice. Just stick with a good read that will do wonders for your sex life.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|My partner and I decided to watch this simply because it seemed like it would be a good movie. This movie was exactly just that, a good movie and maybe even more. The movie does a good job of leading up to the reason's why the main character is trying to run away from her previous life. It makes you attached to all of the characters in the movie.<br /><br />The scenery was setup perfectly for such a romantic movie. From the simple life of living outdoors to the seclusion of a house out in the country. This movie captivated our eyes while we watched it. The ending of the movie took us by surprise, since we both thought there wasn't anything more to the movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a really good romantic movie. It will surely bring at least one kind of element you can relate to.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|I loved the book, and was a little disappointed in some of the changes made by the director/producer.<br />Details which made the book intelligent, interesting and unique..<br />If you liked the movie, definitely buy the book (go to a real bookstore and support<br />local booksellers, or buy it from Isaac Marion's website!)
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun game to play. Mind dazzled puzzles that make you think from start to finish. Hard game to put down.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great cast, good story line, and interesting view on a way of life unknown to me until this masterpiece. Good job.<br />D. Allen, San Antonio, TX
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Same as my other rating, the girls love putting the ballerina and bride costumes on their sticker dolls.  I promised them another set in a few months if they work on sharing the two sets.
B009AMANBA|3.0|I've had all the months since I saw it in the theater to think about whether this movie made a long-term impact on me.  I think pretty highly of Steven Spielberg, especially in comparison to other directors' lack of skill and lack of concern about the moral effects of their movies.  From what I know about Lincoln, it is quite an accurate portrayal of him, and I think Daniel Day-Lewis indeed deserved that Best Actor Oscar.  But despite its amazing attention to historical detail in the sets, and that an actor was able to portray Lincoln's multifaceted personality really well, its MESSAGE felt lacking to me in two serious ways.  I wish, first, that the screenplay by Tony Kushner had not included all the profanity.  According to Civil War historian James McPherson, \\"Lincoln rarely if ever used profanity, and some of the dialogue calls for him to do that. I thought that was a bit jarring.\\"  I did, too.  I think the script would've been pretty good if the profuse cussing had been left out.  But it also didn't go far enough in expressing Lincoln's deeply Biblical appreciation of the value of human life.  Lincoln's faith got a little treatment in the movie, but not as much as it should have, because that was what motivated his sense of justice.<br /><br />Summary:  Excellent acting, very engaging direction by Steven Spielberg, but the script was weak for such a momentous subject, due to its inadequate treatment of Lincoln's faith and in that it expressed an inaccurate impiety on Lincoln's part.  In a movie that's more like a play, which this movie is, pretty much everything depends on the script.  I would still recommend seeing it.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|fun game. would recommend to others. I am officially a nevosoft fan. makes you think. gunner than just hidden object games.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the time period that Downtown Abbey is set in.  The acting is excellent!  Especially the old matriarch, Granny!  I am very disappointed that they keep killing people off though.  I heard they will be killing off Matthew soon!  That is really disappointing.  I do love this show though!
B002WN35DC|5.0|El libro, como siempre, un clasico como pocos.<br /> La version kindle, sin ilustraciones, hace la lectura un poco dificil, sobre todo para los ni&ntilde;os y mas q nada si nunca pudieron leer una edicion ilustrada.

B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|What I appreciate most about this movie is that it penetrated the surface.  Most movies (now-a-days) do not do that...they kind of stay on the surface and deliver the usual story lines.  So it's nice to watch something different in that aspect.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is very fun it's like subway surfers and temple run 1 and 2  and angry gran run<br /><br />Fun
B0028NSE3M|5.0|This is a great! Cd I had not, heard this album since I was a kid. When my mother use to play it, when it first came out on LP. This was Issac Hayes first album he did, this was the begining of many more great! albums from Mr. Hayes. For you old skool folks, this is a must have cd in your collection.  The song walk on by, was use in the movie &#34;Dead President's&#34;  and played at the ending. This cd deserves 10 stars, great! horn sections played by The Bar-Kay's which I didn't know. When I was a kid one of my older brothers, got me hooked on a lot of old skool R & B soul music.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy this game, it really makes you think, pay attention and rely on your memory. I hope they add more levels soon.
B00BPJ5Z96|5.0|See  &#34; Enter The Dragon&#34; On blu-ray is great! because you get the HD, they didn't have surround sounds. And HD in 1973 then it was released, when Enter The Dragon came out on vhs and dvd. For the very frist time, it was certain parts that didn't appear on the first vhs and dvd. But when they released  on the 20th anniverisary, they added what they took out from the origanal version. But because it's 40yrs of it's re release, you get to see from the behind the scenes. And what the Island look like after 40yrs, the director passed away. We all know that Bruce Lee passed away in July 1973, and Jim Kelly passed away in early July at the age of 60. But over all this is a great! martial arts movie, you will never get tired of watching.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Too much detail surrounding sex and not enough story time.  Only reading book number two because friends say it it gets better.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from the movie, but It turned out to be surprisingly pleasant with a good storyline. I would have given it 3 stars, but I thought it was more than just &#34;ok&#34;.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|What a great movie! My grandkids and I love it and watch it often! The world needs more feel god movies like this one.
B000091OB6|2.0|Dont know if my copy was the only off centered pressing (wobbly while playing, pitch gets distorted more and more as the stylus gets closer to the center) so automatically my copy is a dud. a waste of black plastic. i only played it once on both sides and wont be playing again, well..maybe if i wanna hear a wobbly song. ill just display this (as resending this to amazon might cost me on returning the package-im from manila).<br /><br />That aside, this album was a classic. Sleeve and packaging was great, but as many have said the remastered version doesnt sound like it was \\"re-mastered\\" at all. more like de-mastered :)
B000IJ79UW|5.0|The Richard Donner-John williams-Christopher Reeves movie \\"Superman The Movie\\" is a classic and far surpasses the recent \\"Man Of Steel\\" film.Although the story is incredible,it follows the line of the original story.The direction,music,acting and strangely enough,emotions,are outstanding.\\"Man Of Steel\\" might make more money at the Box Office but is a disappointing portrayal of \\"Superman\\"<br />RLK
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I got it for free, and played it obsessively. I finally beat it. then restarted. Great app overall, no glitches or anything.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This gadget, from one of the world's pre-eminent tech giants is a disappointing distraction.  It does nothing new for your TV.  The only broadcasts that can be seen are Netflix, and Youtube.  You can see both on your home TV without this gadget.  You can also view Chrome web sites on the TV with the aid of the Chromecast add-on.  I am surprised that Google released this dongle without more content available.  There is discussion on-line, and in the press that more content may be coming, but for now, nada.  As an early buyer, I was promised a 3 month Netflix paid subscription which was to arrive by e-mail in five days from the shipping date.  No subscription has been forthcoming.  Recommend holding off on buying this gadget until Google provides a lot more content.  In the mean time, this thing is a distraction, and not a notable addition to your digital capabilities.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|I got it for free, so that was a bonus.<br />I play from time to time, and have no complaints.
B00B4804KS|5.0|What can I say &#34;I Loved it&#34; They did a good job of changing this movie into 3D. I keep watching it over and over again.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Works like a charm--quickly learns and makes texting, twitter, email a breeze.  Very smooth usage, I love it.  Love the look of it when in use.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|this game was great until the update. I loved the game. I saw the update and went to play. It kept shutting my device down and I deleted the app. Please Fix.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I really love this game, so hard to stop playing. This game is better then Candy Crush, and Bingo, it keeps me involved
B008JFUNYG|3.0|I came in expecting to be blown away. I left feeling like I missed something.<br />Truthfully; the special effects were better in the original. The scares were more real, and the tense feeling of dread is sorely missing from this one.<br />The backstory they tried to imply, was too little, and not enough information. That should of been left out if they weren't truly going after the mythology of the story.<br />Movie was slightly entertaining. I was truthfully scared of the first one more, and if their are any true fans who appreciated the first; they are going to be disappointed.<br />Aren't there enough horror plots we can make into movies, instead of rehashing what was done already?<br />There is an old saying,\\"If it's not broke, then don't fix it.\\"<br />Oh, and giving this movie 3 stars was being extremely generous.
0307352153|4.0|Because I think I am an introvert, the title of the book appealed to me. I read several chapters before feeling that I was involved with the author's writing process. The author supported her thesis throughout the book which I liked very much, but I kept wanting &#34;a checklist&#34; of actions to take to improve my own introversion. However, Ms Cain provides good information for a person to take and use in a more reflective process than a checklist. I am keeping the book on my shelf to future reference.
B00C061I3K|2.0|And that's make you want to get up and dance. This record fails to do even that. It's just a lot of fuzzy and boring EDM. You wanna listen to robots mope around on a record, go right ahead.
1451668945|5.0|I love the way she develops her characters they are so believable. These were especially juicy. It was a good suspense novel with a lot of twists and turns. Highly recommend it!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Really enjoy there talent!  Arrangements are very good and versatile. I would suggest this cd for any age. Very uplifting!
B006WAIV6M|5.0|I am still in the first half of the book but so far I find it well structured and I absolutely love the narrative style used by the author. As for the content I can only say that some of these things should be thought in school. Although not ground-breaking, the ideas are simple enough to be applied to daily personal and professional lives.
B00130UFY2|4.0|I've seen all of the Bourne movies.  I think Matt Damon is great in the action/spy thrillers.  I wish there were more of these added to the mix.  Maybe a fourth movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's fun till you run out of energy. Other then that it's fun. It has monsters for instance: gremlins. Did you find this review helpful?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game. My granddaughter is 3-3/4 and is getting better at it daily.  Takes a bit of practice to learn how to dodge the bombs and how to jump over them.  But she has the general idea and is improving her scores.  She also plays all Angry Bird games, several letter drawing games and loves bowling games.
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|The book was OK but it could've been better but it was good but a little boring and odd at times
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book started off well but increasingly got more confusing and scattered along the way. It took way too long for the predictable ending, in my opinion.  I felt there was unnecessary foul language, where it didn't do a thing for the story line, and the back and forth litany between the characters got a little boring.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Well, that, and surprisingly good writing. Still though, the main reason anybody went to see this, is to see Giant Mechs kicking Kaiju ass.<br /><br />The story is very simple, and is relatively straightfoward. There are monsters coming from the ocean and creating alot of havoc, and mankind decides to fight back with giant mechs. There, I summed up the movie. But really, is that so bad? No.<br /><br />It is a blockbuster through and through, but unlike other giant robot movies, there is no Micheal bay. Instead, we get really good characters (depending on who you are), Really good writing ( again, depending on who you are), and Kickass Kaiju battles ( they are kickass no matter who you are).<br /><br />So go on, watch it. You won't regret it. Unless you do.
B00A2WM4XW|5.0|It's almost as good as the first one. Or the third. A close tie with the fourth. Ah heck, it might even be better than the fourth one.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This has made it easier to get my Facebook faster and I like it better than some of the other information applications.
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|I loved this movie! It was so sweet how Gru took in the three girls just to get his evil freeze ray just to relize that he really loves the girls and has begun to grow a strong connection with them!
B0000C5RQF|5.0|Great performance by Diana Damrau and a great darker rendition of this wonderful opera! It was all spectacular!!! AMAZING BUY!
B003U4URT2|4.0|This show is very well done. Good acting, great story line (though it's a little slow if you ask me), and likeable characters that we can all relate to in some way or another.<br /><br />I highly recommend this show if you like dramatic intrigue. If drama's your thing and you like mystery, this show will not disappoint you in the least.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I'm loving this game. It has some different challenging puzzles, but you're not timed! It is definitely worth giving a try.
B00BQH9SY0|4.0|The music is very interesting and liked it a lot; some great lyrics-pretty true to life and the music has lots of layers.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Wow. Just W-O-W. This book had me hook, line and sinker. The first chapter had me itching to find out what was happening, and even though I was left confused, it set the tone in a way for the book that was to follow.<br /><br />I immediately fell in love with Colleen Hoover's writing style. It's hard to describe, but it read like poetry and it was so beautiful. I believed every word she wrote. Every emotion she described, and every heartache the characters felt - I felt it along with them. The relationship between Holder and Sky unfolded fast and it felt like free falling reading the progression of their friendship, which ignited an unbreakable bond.<br /><br />I swooned like a schoolgirl through about 80% of the book -giddy to the point of embarrassing. I did not put this down, I devoured every last word Colleen fed me, and then... Ugh. Ouch. Oh the pain.<br /><br />The last 20% of the book felt rushed, a bit of information overload and then a little drawn out towards the end. I will be honest and say there were several incidences, conversations and actions that didn't sit well with me (besides the big SECRET). I felt the characters, particularly Holder, became very out-of-character in his psychoanalysis of the situation.<br /><br />I'm taking half a point off my rating for the last part of the book and the things I had a hard time with. But in saying that, it is a BRILLIANT MUST READ.<br /><br />I have to stress, I LOVED Colleen's writing and this book. I can honestly say her writing style is my very favorite of all the authors I've read. Big call? Yep, and I totally stand by it.<br /><br />Dean Holder:<br /><br />Oh god! What can I say about Dean Holder? I swooned so hard I almost rolled off my couch numerous times. I was so giddy my kids were wondering WTH was wrong with mummy. Holder is sheer and utter perfection. He is moody, smart, affectionate, quick witted, adorable and oh so dreamy. The `non-kiss' was probably better than any kiss I'd ever read. Confused?Yeah, you should be. It'll all make sense once you read it.<br /><br />Sky Davis:<br /><br />I adored Sky. That is a rare thing for me to say about the heroine in books, because I usually find them annoying or irritating at times throughout the book. But not Sky. She was clever and adorable. She had such an amazing friendship with Holder and I LOVED when they would insult each other to keep each other's egos in check - so damn cute! Which girl doesn't love it when a guy tells her she's not that pretty? Well if it's coming from Holder's mouth, I sure as hell would.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|LOVED almost every song which is unusual.  Like this band because not every song sounds the same; it's as if there are at least two different bands playing on one CD.  Melodic and then very alternative at the same time.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I was instantly hooked from the first chapter - the first page even. I will admit the shirtless hottie fist fighting may have had something to do with it. But i literally ignored my kids (and my life) for an entire day or two, and read this book like i was cramming for an exam. FAST!<br /><br />Travis and Abby's `opposites attract' relationship had me gagging for more. The tough guy man-ho and the good girl (with a past) make such an alluring combo that you get totally sucked in. We've all seen this recipe used before in novels, but Jamie has an amazing way of drawing it out to make it realistic AND believable. You live through the emotions Abby and Travis feel, the gut wrenching denial of her feelings for Travis, and his inability to move on is heart breaking.<br /><br />Seeing Travis really fall for Abby and devise his bet to get her to live with him is swoon worthy. Abby's resistance to Travis is frustrating and annoying as hell. But it worked here. Normally i would want to dive into the book and throttle the heroine, and there were times that i wanted to do that. But for the most part, even though you're shaking your head at her and screaming NOOOO, you understand why she does the things she does.<br /><br />The plot and progression is perfectly paced to keep you reading on and on until you've devoured every last word. There is no place in the book where you could happily place your bookmark or turn off your kindle to call it a night.<br /><br />Travis Maddox:<br /><br />There is nothing better to me than a bad boy DONE WELL. And Jamie McGuire captures PRECICELY the perfect combination of bravado, cockiness, wit, humor and sexual appeal without making him seem like a douchebag. He draws you in and you want to know him and what makes him tick. Why he possesses so much anger and rage. What is it about Abby that makes him so obsessive.<br /><br />His raw emotion and no-holds-barred love for Abby is overwhelming. His desperation (but in a sexy swoony way) and the sheer vulnerability that comes through that tough (and sexy as hell) exterior is what makes Travis Maddox a worthy book boyfriend.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy:<br /><br />I really did like Abby - well for the most part. There were times i wanted to shake her and slap her across the face (ie: Thanksgiving at the Maddox house... excuse me while i cry into my pillow), but there were also times where her actions were realistic, even though frustrating. She was trying REALLY hard not to fall for Travis, and i think on the most part it happened without her realising it. Her past is what kept Travis at arms length and when the lines between friendship and love were blurred, oh... it was so addictive.<br /><br />Travis wanted Abby so utterly and completely, that you find yourself rooting for her even if you don't necessarily like her. But she was witty and fun - were her actions questionable? Hell yes! But at the end of the day, she's a 19 year old girl whose complicated feelings for her best friend are turning her life into a disaster... a beautiful disaster.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a game on the Kindle as much as this.  Hope they come out with a new and even better version.  Love it!
B008LV8TSU|3.0|A nice way to spend a quiet evening -- not a book that &#34;forces&#34; me to read other related books, but a good story none-the-less.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I got this app when it was the free app of the day. Never really planned on using it to sleep. Finally used it for that purpose last week because I was to keyed up to sleep. Worked GREAT!
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|Cute film for those of us getting older.  Just the right touches for many of us who are aging - somewhat gracefully.
B009DTI4Y8|2.0|What a shame - this has terrible sound.  Sounds like a bad bootleg - but the concert is amazing with an amazing set list.  Too bad we will never know how good it really sounded...
B002MG2ATY|5.0|After 20+ years, this Oliver Stone tour-de-force holds up remarkably well. One reason is that we haven't been subjected to Kevin Costner overload in recent years, so he's halfway believable as Jim Garrison. Another reason is that the film was already retro-styled two decades in the past when it was being made, so we don't get 1990 continually punching us in the forehead (\\"Look at those cellphones! Look at those shoulder pads!\\"). Gary Oldman as Oswald is as stunning as ever. Joe Pesci is miscast as David Ferrie, but he fills the role with gusto. Tommy Lee Jones is hilarious as Clay Shaw.<br /><br />Oliver Stone took a lot of abuse from the Single Bullet cult when this film came out, but time has killed off the more notable culprits (eg Arlen Specter), and mellowed public opinion on the subject of the Grassy Knoll. Basically, you can now entertain all sorts of alternative theories about the JFK assassination without being thought a Conspiracy Theorist. And public tolerance of the more 'verboten' shadings has broadened. In the early 90s, Oliver Stone couldn't go out on a limb and suggest that LBJ was likely involved in both the assassination and the coverup, but nowadays Roger Stone can put that into a bestseller and find that a half-dozen other recent books have said much the same thing.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie was a real joy to watch I could not leave the screen. The action and plot where thrilling.
B0042KA4VO|5.0|Better than Twilight .... love the series and characters. If you are a new watcher, begin with the 1st series.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Onto the next book....great summer read.  Highly recommend.<br />Great characters, so many twists in the story line.  I enjoyed the book.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved both of Hosseini's previous books (Kite Runner and 1000 Splendid Suns). This latest does not disappoint. It takes the reader from a small village in Afghanistan in the 1940s to contemporary Paris, Greece, and Northern California with a tale of parents and children, husbands and wives torn apart by poverty, war and cultural differences, but connected by the web of circumstance centered on modern Afghanistan. Hosseini succeeds again in mining the complex emotions of those who leave behind their country and strive to make a new life for themselves in a different culture. A very rich and rewarding read!
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|What better way to do this than to give my thoughts on a horror movie that is being hailed as terrifying and a true scare. Here is my take on The Conjuring.<br />I have seen my fair share of horror movies; but the only one in recent memory that i actually consider to be scary is Sinister. However for the next few nights, i will be sleeping with a bible close to my bed. SERIOUSLY. For a movie of its genre, The Conjuring is VERY creepy and while it may not scare some of you right away, the thought of this movie increases its scare factor tremendously.<br />The Conjuring stars a relatively well-rounded cast that consists of: Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor, Ron Livingston, Joey King and the adorable Mackenzie Foy(who played Renesmee in Breaking Dawn Pt. 2). Without giving away the character names or any major details on the characters, I gotta say this: This movie has some REALLY good acting. The moments where these actors are scared; you feel scared right along with them.<br /><br />I will not say if i do or don't believe in demonic possession, but I have to say............The Conjuring makes you not want to say you don't believe in it. The Conjuring is set in the 1970s, and is based upon demonic possession.<br />To describe it, its like The Exorcism(which scared some, some it didnt), the ex tv show Ghost Whisperer, and the movie Paranormal Activity (with a relatively higher IQ) all in one. And while there there a lot of unusual and admittedly scary occurences in The Conjuring, I will also say this movie does involve a doll; and unlike Charles Lee Ray \\"chucky\\"....... this doll literally looks like it went to the very pits of hell and had a good time.<br /><br />I will be buying this movie when it releases on dvd, and even though I am skeptical about the rumored sequel, I rate this movie:<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Thanks again to everyone who reads my reviews. Feel free to comment, make suggestions, or read any other reviews I have written
1250029465|5.0|Just received my book and gave it as a gift to my wife- she read it immediately and absolutely loved it!  Wonderful book well written.
B002DPRLEI|5.0|Our family loves this classic movie!  Rock Hudson, Doris Day and Tony Randall are so wonderful.  We especially love Randall's character as he helps George (Hudson) find another man for Judy (Day), and gets drunk and emotional at the thought of his friend's coming death.  Hilarious and so much fun to watch!  Love this and &#34;Pillow Talk,&#34; as well!
B0061S0A64|5.0|It's very soothing and fun to play with. Getting in a creative mood is easy with this app; it's intuitive and colorful.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|It's a fun show to watch for a $1.  Very glad I waited until it came out on DVD. enjoy
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Although I enjoyed the book if you have read Khaled Hosseini's other books this plot is very familiar and predictable. It does not match his &#34;Kite Runner&#34; when his plot line was new and fresh.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|So I am one of the few people who hadn't seen Harry Potter... great show... saw all of them in 3 day period starting with this one... I loved it
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love that it's contextual and not just predicting based on where my fingers were on the keyboard.  Saved time immediately
B00005N7Z1|5.0|\\"Robocop\\" was one of the best movies of the 1980's. It had some great special effects for it's time,an awesome storyline,great acting,tons of violence,cool characters...and of course the ultimate cyborg crime fighting policeman...Robocop. This movie truly is a work of art,and needs to be in everybody's dvd collection!
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Great movie!!!! The family loved it. Very interesting.... After this movie we went back to watching The Wizrd of Oz.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|A wonderful movie and all family will enjoy! I never get tired of watching this movie over and over! Fantastic movie!

B003B96AOW|5.0|I ordered this on a day when I guess one seller had run out and they switched over to another, so it ended up being five dollars cheaper. The figure arrived a few days later and I have to say, I couldn't believe how big the packaging was. Deadpool stands over seven inches tall but the packaging was probably close to a foot. The action figure and accessories are detailed, well made and impressive. Also included with the figure and seven weapons (two handguns, two sai, two katanas and one machine gun) is a highly detailed two piece base. Quite a lot is included for the price. Recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I originally downloaded the game for my daughter and we both ended up loving it. And I had reached some really cool levels but then my daughter went to play it and the game didn't start at all. I figured it was probably the internet in our home and when it continued to not play for a few days, I took it off my device and downloaded it again and the same issue continued. I'm not sure what happened but I did love the game and my daughter would like her Minions back. As much as I would like to give this game five stars, I would like it fixed first.
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|Game freezes and closes repeatedly when selecting tiles during play. I deleted and then reloaded game to my Kindle hd and that didn't help.
B00E9PXI3S|3.0|First, if you haven't seen the original film, 2010's 'Love Crime', I highly recommend it - it was far superior to this remake. That's surprising when you consider the genius talent involved, such as Brian DePalma and Noomi Rapace. If you are watching this film for the purposes of seeing a hot scene between McAdams and Rapace, it isn't going to deliver (the trailer seems to be pushing for that, so don't expect it). This film overall was very inconsistent. DePalma is a master, and unfortunately that doesn't come through in this picture, though the last half an hour it shines through bit. Rapace is one of the best working actresses today, but she isn't meant to be used frivolously. She's good at very specific things, none of which get utilized in this film. I'm not sure why she was chosen, as fantastic an actor as she is, this is the last role she should have been cast for and doesn't suit her. Consequently, this part plays against type completely for McAdams and suspension of belief really has to work overtime to believe either of these two as these characters. I don't agree with any of the casting choices of the supporting actors, either, for that matter. This film suffers from bad casting choices and I fail to see the point or need of an English remake so close to the original, both in release date and scenes, nonetheless one that doesn't add anything to the experience. So you have to read subtitles with the original Love Crime - you'll quickly forget that, it's so well constructed. The same cannot be said for this film, which never seems like it finds its footing. I'd heard bad things so I wasn't expecting a ton, but I am surprised the film could fall so flat and be so mediocre with so much talent involved.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I installed this app on my kindle fire. installing and downloading it went fast but after the video with minion of the week it tried to download but failed in my view. after about 5to10 minutes I gave up and reinstalled it. after trying once again my patience was almost nothing and I deinstalled it. maybe in the future I will reinstall it once more but as for now I don't want it. its a good thing it was free!
B000UZQI0Q|3.0|Good, but not great, this sequel continues the story of Vin in the aftermath of the catastrophic changes of the 1st book.  Sanderson also takes the time to flesh out some of the other characters with more in-depth POV chapters.<br /><br />Unlike many middle books of a trilogy, it does build to a definite, though not necessarily satisfying, conclusion.  The break between books 2 and 3 isn't just &#34;a convenient place to pause.&#34;
0142418471|5.0|I really love this book because I like john green as an author so I decided to give this book a try. Its about two teens one gay one straight both named will grayson who meet in the most unlikely place ( I don't wanna give it away) it has lots of relatable characters if your not like any of them. Myra the obsessed friend,will grayson(the depressed one),or tiny the gay giant who if fablous and goes threw boyfriends like crazy or will grayson( the quiet kid who thinks the secret to life is not to get involed even though he sighned his name on the letter(read the book again no spoilers) ) to wrap up its an awesome book you'll laugh out loud and get emotionall l at the same time and the ending is just wow its awesome
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I would recommend this book to civilians. I don't think any military personnel would enjoy it.  There is just not enough information for them but for us civilians it's great.  I cannot express my gratitude enough for all the military does & the sacrifices it makes for our country. This book really brings it all to forefront.  They deserve a everything they get & we should always give them all they need.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much !!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 had so much sorrow and angst.  But, as usual, the whole production was done superbly.  Costumes, settings, directions, cast of characters, and the cast......BBC, you totally rock!!!  And AMAZON, you rock too for adding it to your play list.
B0012GMXYM|4.0|A solid 4.5 Stars in reality. Carlos Santana is taking his jazz influences and mixing them with a world music sensibility. This offering is more than just  another entry in Carlos' Jazz &#34;period&#34;. It is a signpost for marking his movement from Fillmore West exemplar through Woodstock phenomenon to Musician Without Borders.<br /><br />Beautiful music, wonderfully played, by first-rate musicians available for your enjoyment and edification in convenient formats. The musical and auditory quality of this CD greatly exceed its modest price.
B0012GMV58|4.0|Actually, I find that this is a 4.5 Star recording, at least. Caravanserai, Love Devotion Surrender, Welcome, and Borboletta are Carlos Santana's Jazz-period. I propose that one should view this like Picasso's Blue Period. It is a distinct, evolutionary process that is encompassed by a specific timeline and producing related works of art.<br /><br />The rating of one piece of art over another becomes an exercise in personal subjectivity (excluding academicians, professional critics, art appraisers, and anyone else whose opinion is the source of their living wage). So, feel free to love this particular offering more than I do, or hate it. That is your subjectivity. Just know that I think this &#34;art exhibit&#34; is well worth the time, effort, and expense.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|How do you adequately review the recent acquisition of one of the seminal recordings from your misspent youth? This Allman Brothers masterwork first entered my life in the vinyl incarnation when it was first produced. It was celebratory, nostalgic, and startling. The original Brothers are well-represented (celebratory & regretful). New directions are showcased (celebratory & startling). Live recordings are preserved (celebratory & nostalgic with regret for that which was lost).<br /><br />Then I bought it in its original CD incarnation. My best friend at first thought that Mountain Jam had been truncated. He thought so because it did not require another disc to contain and fully present the breadth and scope of this opus.<br /><br />Once again, I have 2 CDs with the entire original on the first disc. The second disc contains all of the concert from which some of the live material originally issued in the other incarnations was derived. This latest version is remastered, expanded, and cost less than the first CD version.<br /><br />So how does it sound? Same as it ever was, except it is substantially better. Like really good authentic soul food, The Allmans are either an acquired taste or more of a regional favorite than some folks like. So either Caveat Emptor, or Laissez les bons temps rouler.
0789318245|3.0|The artwork is great however, I found the accompanying stories to be uncouth and dull.<br />The stories were focused on the artists which, while they obviously played a huge role, they neglected to go into detail regarding the reasoning or meaning behind their styles.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Nice, even pace, involving story.  Found content best suited to female readers.  Enjoying the interplay between past and present.  Character development was effective.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Only part way through but I'm enjoying this game. The puzzles are simple but entertaining. A good little time waster!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Best TV series in years.  Harvey & Mike are Batman & Robin.  Never miss it.  I wish the seasons were longer.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|My breath has left my body. That's what this relationship did to me. It was breathtaking. I didn't want it to end. Ever. The unwritten words left lingering in the air. And nothing I can say in this review would do it justice. Just read this. Now.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Overall, the style, operation and gameplay are very good. I can see myself eventually getting bored with this game as there is no storyline or anything, but not today. Not for a while. This is a very well-done game.
B00DU74U74|1.0|I hated this movie.more than I've ever hated.a movie in my life. It was awful. Whatever you do don't rent this movie.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|my daughter likes it but it is kind of slow in pace, but anyway little girls like this game !
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Fine tale, and extremely funny in its portrait of British pols.  He is still a master and I look forward to reading another of his recent works.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well plotted, unusual characters, and some truth buried in there about relationships (e.g., the &#34;cool girl&#34; rant).  I'd read another by her, even though I tend to shy away from best sellers.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was an amazing gift that  was recommended to me- a true gift! It was beautifully written and offered an insight into processing how tragic and beautiful our lives can be.  I am very grateful for the author writing a book that made laugh out loud while crying. Definitely a worthwhile experience to read.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This is a really good game with a fun story line. This game was good as it kept you interested with different kinds of puzzle such as finding, spacial, anagrams etc. It was really great and suitable for most ages
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Just finished building a new PC with this processor. Great value here, especially if you plan on overclocking. I would recommend this especially since the newer generation of Intel processors are out now - prices will be dropping!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's kind of boring and dull, the only things I keep it for are the competitions and the possibility of getting a new horse. But if you really want a horse and can't get it, or you can't be with it all the time, it's a good alternative.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Enjoyed the movie a lot. Good plot, it followed the book very closely which made it a good choice to rent.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I've been anticipating getting my Chromecast since it was first announced. So, luckily, when it came in the mail, setup was super easy and fast. I used the Chromecast app on my Nexus 7 and was guided easily through setup.<br /><br />I immediately began streaming my first video from the Chrome browser on my laptop. At first, my image was chopped on the edges, and I thought it was the Chromecast. However, I soon learned it was the overcast feature on my television, and I promptly disabled it.<br /><br />Since then, it's been fantastic. Great quality. No audio/video lags. I've had a couple stutters in streaming but that's largely due to my internet connection. The apps for casting are somewhat limited for now, but I have full confidence the market will expand. Even so, for $35, why wouldn't you buy this?
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Excellent movie at a good price. Jack and Diane are perfect in the movie together.  You will love it.  Do
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|please refrain from idiotic sarcasm. just go buy the thing.then there will be no need for foolish bleacher jargon, as you will know first hand.
B00AB16ER6|5.0|This is a stellar band I own alot of Richie Kotzens solo stuff I knew he was great and beside these other two fine musicians this is the album of the year
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is pornography for women. If you tell your men not to watch porn, you better not read this book! There are chapters that go in full sexual details. I should've read the reviews before buying it
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Kind of boring.  Hard to understand what they are saying sometimes so I used captions.  Don't want to give anything away other than don't expect it to be too funny.
0451232852|2.0|There was definitely too much detail re: politics and battles.  I understand it is necessary to write about this kind of information for the integrity of the plot but it was way too overdone.  I resorted to skipping paragraphs and pages. The story line was very good and the characters definitely kept my interest but it was just too tedious to continue reading to the end.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|3 - 3.5 actually.  I loved The Kiterunner and One Thousands Suns and was so sad when I finished them.  This book, And the Mountains Echoed, just does not even come close to them.  The first part of the book was wonderful and I was very excited to be reading Hosseini's 3rd novel; however, the story became very confusing and tedious to read not too far in.  The story jumps around, all over the place and I found myself, at just about every new chapter, trying to figure out who I was reading about and how they would tie into the beginning of the story. The ending was very disappointing to me also. The reason I gave it this rating though is that the story was good once I figured out what was going on.  It was worth reading, just not nearly as good as Hosseini's other books.  I waited so long for this one and it just didn't cut it.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|From the first I heard this album, I enjoyed it immensely and viscerally. The timbres that HTDA explores are superb, mixing many of the most original techniques of electronic music with skilled instrumental performance and Mariqueen Maandig's evocative vocals, and the arrangement of songs in Welcome Oblivion -- even (or perhaps especially) with the bonus tracks on this edition -- work superbly as an album, not merely an accumulation of music. It is music that rewards repeated listenings, and well worth the price.
B006BQNJR8|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie as I'm a big fan of Conan. For the most part it succeeds at bring out what makes Conan great, high-impact action, great scenery, hot women (what?) and a strong lead character. I can't give it five stars because about midway through the movie it starts to race to the end. A action movie like this should have been a little slower paced and the characters fleshed out more. But as far as action movies go, it's ok!
B009ZQJ0ME|5.0|I'm going to keep this short. Equilibrium does what very few action moves do well, and that's create an intresting world unfold a good story and still kick butt in the action genre. Love it, love it, love it.
B00407PNY2|4.0|I remember seeing this when it first came to theaters. We stayed and watched the chase scene twice because of the driving action.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|I like all the Ocean's movies, but think this one was the best. Hope there will be a 14, but doubtful. All the characters do a good job and the plots are well thought thru.
0307352153|5.0|Not all that time that staying quiet helps us in developing our lives. Being in a society that's dominated by a lot of extroverts, this book discusses the introversion at home and at the workplace of a person. There are times that an introvert should be an extrovert when the timing requires. On the other hand, this book would also benefit extroverts who are thinking that it's a lot better being an introvert. Also, this book defends the judged introverts who are thought of being different because they would prefer. From the perspective of the author herself who is also an introvert, this book would seriously reach out to other introverts out there. There's a positivity and negativity on the introvert and extrovert divide. Most of us should utilize these divides properly in order to become effective in all our endeavors. One should make a break through to achieve personal and business goals, like what I've read from [[ASIN:0985539305 Superhero Success: Expand Your CAPE-ability To Break Through Any Challenge, Overcome Any Fear, And Become A Superhero In Life And Business! (Volume 1)]]. Relating it to my experience in reading this book, understanding the nature of an introvert could make a breakthrough to a person's lifetime.
0743201140|5.0|I'm a very curious person and for the past few months I've been venturing a new path in one of my businesses. As many would know, it's hard starting from square one when it comes to businesses. I've spent tons of hours God knows how long solving loads of problems that I encounter every now and then just to prevent my business from failing. It was then when I was reading [[ASIN:0985539305 Superhero Success: Expand Your CAPE-ability To Break Through Any Challenge, Overcome Any Fear, And Become A Superhero In Life And Business! (Volume 1)]] that I've learned that by thinking too much of my problems regarding my business that I'm attracting negative thoughts in my system. I've thought of overcoming them and searching deep inside me to find my inner strength. Thankfully, I came across Now, Discover Your Strengths. This has taught me not to focus on the weaknesses. Rather I should focus more on my strengths. In doing so, there's a lot to be done than wasting time focusing on an issue that may take long to solve and may hinder from productivity to take place. This has surely helped me lessen all my burdens in terms of managing not only my business but also in my personal life.
B00C2IPB70|5.0|Love this movie ! even better i got this movie in steel book case. Came in very good quality and Picture is crisp clear
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is awesome and the updates are so cool! It's very entertaining and can help me pass time. I would definitely recommend.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|You can only use the video feature a very limited number of times before it begins requiring you to purchase &#34;Cam Coins.&#34;  I definitely do not feel this app is worth paying for.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|We recently bought a set from Amazon.com and our family liked it a lot.  From reading other reviews, I think we bought the fourth edition.  The interlocking boundary pieces worked well in my opinion.  I don't understand why some reviewers complained about the interlocking mechanism not working.  The quality of the board is just OK, and I doubt that it would last more than 50 times of play.  If you play every week, then you probably will need a new set in a year or so.  So it is quite pricey with a price tag of about $40 for such a board game.<br /><br />Strategy-wise, it is quite easy as there are not a whole lot variations in the best moves.  I say this in comparison with chess.  The initial placement of the two houses carry too heavy a weight on the outcome depending on how the board is assembled.  In some cases, one player just wants to forfeit after the initial placement.<br /><br />For some reason, this game brings out the worst part of competitiveness of human nature.  I often see otherwise well-behaved kids end up unhappy after loosing. It might be helpful to remind everyone that it is just a game.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Always been a great admirer of Mrs. Thatcher but this movie missed the mark for bringing out her true character. Regretted wasting my time watching it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The previous edition was great.I will remove the update from kindle it is unusable. It's a shame that you ruined a good app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think My Horse is fun and really easey to play u will defenetly fall in love with this game!

B004KPX4W2|4.0|Funny shoot 'em up with great actors having a GREAT time! Suspect there will be a Red 3 as we just saw 2 and liked it too.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|With this book John Steinbeck got a nobel prize, No word is required to describe how important and intersting it is
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen house and Redfield Farm should be read together.  both wonderfully written and they tell the story of slavery from two sides.
1476734941|5.0|My husband and I have finally found an approach to eating healthy foods that work for us, and we've both lost several pounds.  After only 2 months on this program, we both weigh less than we have in many years.  We eat light on 2 days per week and enjoy eating and drinking what we like the rest of the time.  I can't remember ever not feeling guilty when indulging in a dessert - now I can, because I have a balanced approach!  The pattern of denial and guilt has been broken!
B009K6DKTS|4.0|A tour through the fragility of modern life and the knowledge that can be gain from simple pragmatic's. Lessons taught by history and stoicism identify that nothing much changes. We as people are easy fools to ourselves.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I have always been a fan of these authors and I have read almost all of their books. They have the experience to craft a well written tale. But lately I have been disappointed by their stories. They have made the Pendergast character into one with superhuman abilities and I feel it is unnecessary. If you look past those parts, it is a well crated tale, but I know the authors could do better.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Liked it, even though I had seen some bad reviews.  Tom Cruise did a good job.  No he is not 6'10, or 300 lbs like in the books, he was very believable
0671646788|5.0|The second book that need to to read by anybody really ready to change their life for the work of the kingdom of God.<br /> Thank You!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You must download this game it is so worth it :)<br />You will not want to stop playing it.<br />Highly recommended
B00594XOZU|5.0|What is up people I just got this app a month ago it rocks!!! It's available for kindle fire HD witch is what I have. It seriously works it doesn't interrupt wen your doing something else!!!!!!!
B00BY8DIT2|3.0|It suffers from overproduction.  Good blues and electric guitar does not need a full orchestra behind.  The first album is a great collaboration.  This one is not.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|Really talented band that is heading for the big time. The next Cold Play. Looking forward to their next CD.
0920668372|5.0|We first got it for our kids 25 yrs ago and have given away a couple dozen since.  It's our go to package topper for showers.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I like to have a calculator handy when I'm at work. So I can figure things up when I don't have my phone or a computer near me.<br />I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good calculator.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|This album is a must-have. I had the greatest hits of the Doors but when my local classic FM station plays songs like Soul Kitchen and I can't find them on the greatest hits, I realize that I have to have the original album. Yes, you'll read how this album has been remastered and it doesn't sound the same as the original vinyl recording but so what? You can finally hear what Morrison says about his girlfriend in &#34;Break on Through&#34; (it was censored in the original recording). People tell me that no one buys CD's anymore. I have no interest in MP3 files. The quality is awful. Give me a CD any day. The sacrifice of using MP3 files for their portability it not worth the crappy quality.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is very challenging.<br />It is a very good game for little kids.<br />I would recommend it to anyone.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Great guests - Heavy riffs - Heart felt Lyrics - Brutal drums - and a flurry of other words that make this the summers greatest effort to date. Way to go 5FDP. Keep them coming.
