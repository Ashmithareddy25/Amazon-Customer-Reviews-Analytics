B009JBZH54|5.0|IF you are a Batman fan, this was awesome; however, what was even better was the price i got for it.  Great pricing.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Great way to pass the time!  Fun game, I am just not sure if I am playing it correctly.  It seems that I never pass the first level?  My kids could probably tell me that I am not playing it right.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have no words to describe this book other than beautiful.  I contemplated not finishing it once I<br /> realized what had happened to Sky.  I thought it would be too soul crushing to read, but the word choices, the advice, the nature of the characters to take care of each other was simply beautiful.
034580404X|5.0|Perfect collection for any 50shades lover, or great as a gift for anyone who has wanted to read them...but hasn't gotten up to buy them! Decently priced for all 3 novels. Great read :)
B000816TCY|2.0|Spoke with vendor about who the manufacturer and name appeared on battery, he said Nikon but no packaging or documentation, I have found the battery does not hold a charge. I was probably, I'm guessing, the 2nd owner and the battery had been  returned by a previous customer. I have an original Nikon battery in my camera which still holds a charge for a longer time than the one I'd received, so I'm guessing the price was low because the battery was inadequate.
B002BY77CW|2.0|The book is definitely not a 'page-turner' but that is not why I bought it.  I am intrigued by Lauren Conrad and was surprised to learn that she also wrote books.  I wanted to see if she was very good at writing and surprisingly I was impressed!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have not had any issues or problems with this app. Works as it should. I recommend highly to anyone.
0785163174|5.0|This is a very large graphic novel and is full of extras and tie-ins.  I got it because I hadn't read any of the Avengers vs. X-men books and I wanted the full story in one shot.  I was not disappointed.  It also comes with a free digital copy for your computer or smartphone!

B009VMN3RA|5.0|Sachi Parker has written an honest and emotionally candid book about her life as the daughter (Shirley Maclaine) and neice(uncle is Warren Beatty) of true Hollywood royalty.<br /><br />After reading the book it isn't surprising that Shirley won her only Academy Award for \\"Term of Endearment\\". Shirley wasn't really acting at all in the role of Aurora Greenway.<br /><br />A mother who abandons their only child and then continues to use and exploit that child's emotional weakness due to the childhood abandonment as a pawn after they reach adulthood in several best selling books, as a date on Oscar night, to give the further appearance of being a loving mother for additional career advancement is defined in the mental health as having \\"sociopathic tendancies\\".<br /><br />Hollywood should be embarassed having kept Shirley's secret all these years and duping the theater going public into believing she was a loving mother and wife. Sachi was merely a PR tool to advance her mother's career in the 50's and 60's studio system and that is evident in the actions Shirley took basically \\"paying\\" her husband and Sachi's father Steve Parker to care for her in Japan.<br /><br />Most famous Hollywood parents have the common sense to create trust funds for their children, to avoid the ugly truth coming out, but Shirley Maclaine is way too greedy for that. This is a woman worth over $25 million dollars that wouldn't pay for her daughter to go to college, help her land a big agent, or buy her a car.<br /><br />Sachi is an amazing and beautiful person and her story is a triumph of the human spirit. May this book go on to be a best seller all over the world.
030758836X|3.0|I couldn't put this book down and it twists and turns in amazing ways. But the ending was a stupid, dumb, unbelievable and disappointing mess that could've been much more clever!

B000JPRPAO|5.0|The Italian Job is one of the great heist movies.  I have seen in many times and it gets better every time I see it. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes complex, yet well-developed caper films.
0743289692|4.0|I found this book very informative and it made me feel very happy that I could live in Canada.  I did not fully realize the burdens that these people must endure.  It is well written and easy to understand.

0307346617|5.0|this book great to read. The stories told are suspensful and well detailed. i was confused at first when i read it because i thought they were the stories of one person but then i realized they were different peoples accounts. The descirption does say that too.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Free substitute for SimCity. Graphics leave something to be desired.<br /><br />A little hard to figure out at first but fun from there.
B00138H0H4|5.0|I found this album while searching on Amazon for cheap music I can use for my DJ gig. It was $2.99 and had a high rating, so I figured what the heck? 2 hours later, having listened to it in its entirety twice in a row, I was in awe that I had never paid this amazingly talented woman any attention before. I primarily listen to Classic Metal, Metalcore, and Thrash, but I can listen to and appreciate all types of music. Brandi Carlile's voice is pure gold, and her songs are so full of emotion and energy that it is impossible to not pay complete attention to every song, regardless of what you were doing when you started listening. Finding this album is one of the happiest surprises I've had in years. At 3 bucks, you would be nuts not to buy this amazing musical experience, regardless of your musical preferences.

B00422LESO|4.0|The Austen subculture came to its peak in January 2013 when the world celebrated the 200th anniversary of the publication of Pride and Prejudice. In the background of this event, I picked up \\"Austenland\\" and it did not disappoint. Shannon Hale's story is a parallel narrative or revisionist tale of Pride and Prejudice played out in the 21st century. Almost any woman - with or without a BBC Darcy obsession - will relate to it. Jane Hayes, the protagonist is named obviously after the author's inspiration. The story itself is a light-hearted but engaging tale of finding love in the most unlikely of places -- sometimes it's not even in the same century.
B008Q0D32S|4.0|Truely ahead of its time. Directed by a true genius. Some of the most powerful scenes are not muttled by clumsy dialogue. Stunning!
B008XCJ03K|5.0|While looking through all of the albums on sale on Amazon for 3 or 4 bucks, I came across Passenger's \\"All the Little Lights\\", and noticed it had a solid 5-star rating with dozens of reviews posted. I'm glad it peaked my interested, because after buying this album and listening though twice, I can honestly say that this is one of those albums that is so awesome that it makes the world a better place by existing. Like I said in my review title, the sublime music, lyrics, singing, and emotion on this album makes listening to it a wonderful experience. Buy this now!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book! I really enjoyed the book.I loved the end. The Valentine's Dance was a funny part in the book.
B00005JLO2|5.0|Thankfully we watched this movie before reading all the negative reviews which enlightened us as to historical accuracy. (poor).f<br />I probably would focus on these deficiencies and enjoy the movie less.<br /><br />Movie was produced with a large budget and it shows- hundreds of extras, elaborate sets, one of the epicBritish-made movies<br />(and not Hollywood as some critics alleged).<br /><br />It was entertaining, gripping, and we could not stop watching.<br />Perhaps as a history channel entry documentary it failed, but as an entertainment it did not.

B004KKXMSI|3.0|Jurassic Park is a great movie! JP2: Lost World is decent. JP3 is horrible. How horrible? Well, they couldn't sell it without bundling it with JP1, that's how horrible.<br /><br />Picture quality isn't that much better than VHS. It doesn't look like HD quality, a bit grainy.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I'm really liking this mouse. Really smooth movement and super accurate. It spoiled me so much I'll have to buy one for my work PC.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Arrived quickly from Amazon, and well packaged.  It's a nice Blu-ray/DVD combo, altough I'm not really sure how much Blu-Ray matters for an animated movie.  The story is great, but introduces a lot of concepts that may be beyond (or too intense for) chidren 3 or under.  Our daughter liked the movie, but only in 15-20 minutes bites.

B00296A4F4|5.0|Love Glee! My first time watching the series and I can't stop! I really like the show. I don't know why I've never watched previously.
B0053O89WY|3.0|It's sad that after the first 3 seasons, this show feels like it's gone downhill in my taste. Sure there's always something happening... yet it feels like certain elements have gotten stagnant. Like how in 90% of this season, Sheldon is still the epitome of cold scientific condescenscion. Only a couple of times (towards the end) does his character actually show any genuine humane side. Otherwise, he's mostly a total jerk or his condescenscion seems to be a set-up for someone else's joke (which, more often than not, actually does seem good).<br />With the setting up Howard with his fiancee, Beatrice, for their wedding, there's always (as normal) mixups, misdirections, and misadventures. And some of them turn out to be better than others.<br />It's toward the end of this season that's got me at a personal dilemma. Though things have gotten out of control for me (for such a show as this, the sex jokes really are getting old), the hope presented at the end have me considering if I should try the next season.<br />At this point, it's just a possibility.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't read it fast enough, anxious for book three! Loved this book. kept me anxiously awaiting the next word! Great book

B001P06GX4|5.0|Since we received this game for Christmas, we have played it at least once and sometimes a dozen times a day! My 3.5 year old can follow the basic rules though has interesting \\"strategy\\" but around the time she can't play any more pieces her attention span runs out as well. My 5.5 year old has really mastered the strategy and frequently wins. When it is just he and I, we made up some rules to make it more challenging but keep it to two colors. Sometimes we play our pieces in the order of blocks - the 1-piece, then the 2-piece, then the 3-pieces, then the 4-pieces, then the 5-pieces. Sometimes we start with the 5's and count down. And sometimes we play where the second player always has to play the same piece the first player played. Great fun for everyone!

B002W5UVSM|4.0|Hysterical, I've never read anything like it. Your insult lexicon will explode after this read. I'd have to admit<br />that I caught myself laughing hysterically while reading it. Absolute intellectual absurdity and hilarity. You will not be disappointed.

0743270754|5.0|I haven't started reading this yet; I got it for my husband, who loves history, especially the history of the Civil War. He's really enjoying it, and frequently reads excerpts to me or tells me about what he has been reading.

1451695195|3.0|I saw this doctor's interview about his encounter of visiting Heaven. Since I, too, am a believer there is a Heaven, I ordered the book. It was difficult to understand. It had medical terms a layman couldn't understand; although, I am thrilled the doctor now believes in Heaven, I wouldn't recommend his book. I wish there was a more simplified version with better understanding.

B008K6HN8I|1.0|I might have a wrong understanding of what this app is supposed to do. But I thought it said it can read .mobi files so after I downloaded it I tried to read some .mobi files that I have and it couldn't do it. That's all I needed it for and it didn't seem to work so I uninstalled it. I am sure its pretty effective for other stuff though.

B004UC4HCG|3.0|UPDATE:  Four months after purchase, the integrated GPU crashed and died. The good news is that Shuttle's customer support was excellent. Without any hassle they promptly agreed to send me a new motherboard (with a deposit hold pending receipt of the dead unit). The replacement came in about one week, and it is working fine so far.<br /><br />Two complaints about this system:<br /><br />1. There are two SATA data cables (one for the HDD and one for the optical drive). The longer cable was plugged into the motherboard and run through a channel in the frame, leaving only a couple of inches free (not enough to reach the drive bay) so I had to pull it back through the channel (a bit of a struggle). The shorter cable (in the spare parts bag) must be used for the HDD connection because it is definitely too short to reach the upper drive bay (optical drive). In my struggle to stretch the shorter cable to reach, I broke off part of the plastic clip (not very good data clips- easy to slip out) and had to replace the data cable. The data cable connection should be the easiest part of the assemply of a system, but this was the hardest.<br /><br />2. The printed  instructions did not mention that the front USB ports (3.0) are disabled until you install the drivers from the driver DVD (or that the driver disc must be loaded AFTER Windows is installed). I was trying to use the front ports during the installation process and had to read the manual on the DVD to learn these things. They should have been included in the printed instructions.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Hugo goes overboard on the detail at times to develop the characters and the setting for events.  But overall I am enjoying the book. It has valuable moral lessons and it has captured me with the emotion of the story.  It's very long, though, and I'm not even half the way through.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|Although I have enjoyed DA I was very frustrated with the way they killed off Matthew. Most disappointed because I understand it was the actor playing the role who wanted out, to 'do more challenging roles,' etc. Celeberties are in the buisness to entertain. Thats why they do it. If it was all in the name of artistic expression then he should have stayed with stage performance. Very dissapointing on all points. Hope there is some way the directors/writers can dig their way out, or I'm sure the next season will be the last if it is not cancelled.

0385736002|4.0|I bought this book on impulse at (eek!) B&N. I find it entertaining, and I have seen 15 years many times, so I am hardly a YA.<br /><br />The author Scott has the mechanics of writing a series of books down well, and, for the most part, I find it interesting to come along with him. I grant him that.<br /><br />The book opens in the middle of a bit of a mystery, and rapidly becomes the middle of a culminating moment in a drama that has taken a long time to unfold to this level.<br /><br />There are twins age 14 and an ancient being 2500 years old who is also a teenager, if only in form. The book hurries on, one historical and Googeable character after another takes the stage and fades away two dimensionally (oops, I telegraphed a bit of judgment there, my bad). Then another two-dimensional character pops up in scary, haunted house carnival ride fashion. And so, incredibly predictably, on and on....<br /><br />Finally this first book reaches it end, a cliffhanger, so that you are more likely to buy the second book. Hook them book by book, the hackneyed Bible tells us. Yes, yes. Seen that, read that before. Ho hum. Nothing new here. Move on.<br /><br />Some reviews bring up Harry Potter. Harry potter in Scott's dreams, perhaps. This is not Harry Potter. Rowling is a vastly better and more creative writer that Scott. Scott is derivative, not so creative: Clever, yes, at the margins, but not creative. Potter books stand on there own and do not obviously end in the cliffhanger cliche seen since the thirties Saturday matinee serials for kids that Scott employs.<br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing part of Scott's mechanical writing is his complete failure (so far at least) to understand alchemy. He swallows whole that alchemy means to make gold out of base metals (really no more than a kind of smelting, I would believe). He also touts alchemy as turning coal into diamonds, something that Superman did with his incredible strength, if I remember correctly (no alchemy needed there).<br /><br />No, I'm not talking about whether or not alchemists can turn base metal into gold, you know, really, but that this idea masks a deeper meaning of alchemy: Alchemy is about transmuting base consciousness into higher consciousness. To someone who is literal minded, this presents itself as something physical, stone into gold, say, and not as spiritual, turning base conscious awareness into higher awareness. This is an important distinction, and it amuses me to see Scott commit such a blunder.<br /><br />Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel are centuries old, immortal as long as they take their potions every month, and have advanced remarkably little in the tale Scott foists on us. What a pity and a waste of life. This is still a tale of good versus evil, and the idea is for good to to fight evil (something I find I now have to explain after waves of zombie and vampire romances).<br /><br />As anyone with an ounce of higher understanding might tell you, fighting evil is self defeating. It grants evil (which is fundamentally a delusion of separation) power and existence that it would not have unless one mentally concedes that it is real and has power.<br /><br />Scott portrays the wife, Perenelle, as the worst offender in this delusion, and characterizes her as a fighter, much more so than Nicholas. I see no idea in Perenelle of what I see in the real world, which is that females are fundamentally more capable of higher consciousness than men. It seems it's always better for the boy to be several years older than his sister, so that he may have half a chance of keeping up with her. Maybe Perenelle could own a wrestling franchise and make money entertaining people in fictitious battles of good and evil all neatly tied up in a ring?<br /><br />And Scatty, the red haired forever teenager martial artist who supposedly invented almost every martial art, is a nothing more than a poor caricature of martial arts. She is merely a fighter, a really good fighter, but just a fighter nevertheless. There is no sense of the deeper aspects of martial arts wherein one transforms the energy of your opponent. Silly stuff.<br /><br />The twin Sophie, however, does show herself to be much more aware than her brother Josh. I am in the second book now, where Sophie has already been awoken but Josh has not (sorry if that spoils your day). She is initially flooded by sensations and her awareness of the external world is switched on. This shows some hope that Scott is aware that we humans have evolved so that we are almost entirely in our heads, separated from life, and settling for a bland and comfortable description of the external world, one in which we avoid discomfort. Perhaps a good first step would be to sink down from the prison of the head to a deeper level of direct  perception. Well, maybe not.<br /><br />Josh, Josh, Josh. I am embarrassed to be a guy after reading about this guy. His behavior is maddening. He is jealous that his sister is awakened and he is not, and he feels more separated than he did before> His sister has advanced and he has not. What does he do with this? Why, he's jealous. Does he feel glad that his sister has advanced? Not hardly.<br /><br />He is gullible and believes in the obvious villain Dr. Dee, and mistrusts Nicholas Flamel. Conflicted is too easy of a word to label Josh. I would say incapable of a sustained thought might be more like it. I will be interested to see if the twins evolve at all when they come into their powers. Perhaps Scott will surprise me and they will elevate themselves beyond separation and struggle. Or will Josh be merely self satisfied when he is awakened and feels he is once mor on a par, or above, his sister?<br /><br />I was unfamiliar with the book of Abraham the Mage used by Scott. What I found is \\"The Book of Abramelin\\", apparently an Egyptian who taught magic to Abraham of Worms, a German Jew, in the 1300-1400s. It was translated by Samuel Mathers from incomplete manuscripts and was popular in the 19thC by the worse than crackpot Aleister Crowley. I assume this is the book Scott references and not the Mormom Book of Abraham. There is a new, and better translation available, but I doubt that I will be buying it soon. The heroin addict Crowley is not much of a recommendation to me.<br /><br />(BTW, have you seen the Amazon video? This is one adaptation into form that is most unfortunate. The characters and their voices make cartoon characters seen sublime. Mr Scott must have missed some degree of creative control in his contract to let this travesty be made.)<br /><br />Well, Michael Scott's hackneyed writing has accomplished his goal. I read the first book, for it entertaining enough to partially excuse its shallowness, and bought the second book. Actually, I bought the first three books in one Kindle deal, at a price of about buying the second and third book.<br /><br />All I can tell you is that a writer should do more than research Wikipedia and Google and do more than dip his pen in superficial homage to some mythic being in writing a book for young adults today. He really ought to attempt to understand his material, not just find filler for chapter after chapter.<br /><br />Why? Because, for example, we are facing a debate today over gun violence in reaction to the horror of Sandy Hook. What do some of us do? We look to the external and try to control it. \\"Guns scare me,\\" they say, \\"so I want to limit your ability to have scary things.\\"<br /><br />Now, nobody sane that I know of wants mentally ill people to act out their insanity in violence and we should deny them access to guns and to sharp, pointy things. But, the problem is internal, not external. I believe that if people who feel separated enough from other beings that they believe they can harm others without harming themselves, then that is clearly insanity. No insanity plea is needed. Insanity is the problem, not the weapon (gun, knife, club, bookend, poison, etc.) that the insane chose.<br /><br />If you believe that guns are scary, then do you believe that first shooter video games where we can dispassionately shoot people and blow them up in a gory explosion of brains and guts, and laugh at it, enjoy it, is acceptable?<br /><br />When you see a parade of movie stars come out and condemn violence, and you see them immediately in film and TV clips where THEY are shooting the hell out of people (and getting rich doing it), do you find that acceptable?<br /><br />Yes, you have a first amendment right to say what you wish, but this does not mean that you may escape consequences for what you say. Just because you have a right to say something does not mean that it is right to say it. It would be nice to find popular fiction for YA that breaks the violence and good against evil meme for a change.<br /><br />A story like this is a missed opportunity to approach what we believe is evil in a fundamentally different way. This is especially true when writing about an alchemist, one who is a practitioner in transformation. Scott misses this entirety; it appears to be over his head and not even conceivable to him.<br /><br />One can be awakened to transforming one's opponent rather than fighting him. Fighting your opponent brings you down to his level and you defeat yourself in the process. Transform your opponent and you both will be richer. I'll leave out the details, for now, until I write my own book along these lines.<br /><br />I hope to read the rest of the books in this series and I then to write a future review in which I say that I was wrong this time, and that Michael Scott has the stones to get what alchemy and transformation means. I would love to write that he created a world like ours, one of separation, struggle, and strife, lulling us into familiar territory, in order to contrast with the eventual transformation of spirit that awaits us in the later books.ts and was popular in the 19thC by the worse than crackpot Aleister Crowley.

B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I couldn't watch the whole thing, I got to the part  where Denzel is in the hospital and skipped to the end....what was with the gratuitous nudity at the beginning????? Why is an actor with Denzel's status doing a scene like that, and why are they degrading this actress???? It wasn't just the nudity-it was shot deliberately for the erotic value and totally exploitive-more exploitive than some scenes I've seen in movies in which there was more sexual content...<br /><br />Anyway, another lame excuse of an ad for 12 step programs for alchoholics, the same old tired and shaming/blaming idea that the alchoholic has to hit bottom yada yada all the while the sucess rate of AA is shockingly low and many of it's ideas harmful particularly to those who have endured any kind of abuse....for some people it works, but c'mon stop showing these idealized 'everything is great now' easy outcomes...you know, the old 'it's all my FAULT and I'm a bad person but now I'm in AA and my life is so GREAT' cliches......<br /><br />Apart from all that and the ridiculous symbolism of the plane chopping off the church steeple the movie is just pretty bad overall......Denzel does a fine job acting, but everything else needed a LOT of work. The only engaging part of the movie was the actual flight and crash......<br /><br />What a waste of time....
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I am kind of obsessed with this movie. The characters are great, the story is predictable yet still has wonderful little surprises. And the music is incorporated wonderfully.
0307474259|5.0|This book is a great informational tool to learn about a low carb diet!  It definitely swayed me into starting a low car diet!
B005K2YRVG|5.0|I was disappointed with the kindle but this product can protect. I would recommend anyone that needs it.  Had to return back because I no longer wanted the kindle
B005LAIHZY|3.0|The quality of the film was wonderful as expected, but the storyline left much to be desired. In comparison to other princess type movies Brave didn't satisfy. Not a movie I will willingly watch over and over. I bought it as a Christmas present for my 4 year old granddaughter who also received Tangled and Cinderella. I know out of those 3 it would be my 3rd choice to watch.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|It has been a long time since I saw The Godfather. This is a pleasant surprise: Godfather, Godfather2, Godfather3 and supplements on four blu-rays. Coppola's team cleaned up every inch of the master tapes and the result is amazing.<br />If his crew did as well on the blu-rays of Apocalypse Now, Apocalypse Now Redux and Hearts of Darkness, which refers to the Joseph Conrad novel on which Apocalypse Now was based, I will be doubly amazed. I have ordered the blu-ray set from Amazon and will review it soon after it arrives.<br />I don't expect any further masterpieces from the old man, but I do have a number of excellent films from another Coppola, his daughter Sofia, who may release some more.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This book was reasonably fast paced and was very informative without being boring. Had good character development and got you wrapped up in the story quickly. Would read another Lee Child book for sure.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Being ex-military this story surprised me from start to finish.  Even if you don't like military type stories this book is a good read.  Overcoming adversity is the general theme and I cannot believe one man could accomplish what he did.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|I like Andrea Bocelli....it has only a few songs in sapnish, but it is very nice to hear Andrea sing in spanish.
B008KGPEQG|4.0|As Auster's contemporary, I understand much of his experiences.  However, I find his observations to be mundane and not very interesting.  He organizes this uninteresting information in a unique way that makes the book fun to read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|excellent app and simple to use<br />I would highly recommend this over many of the other weather apllicatins for the kindle.
B00190N4E4|5.0|In 1893, Mohandas Gandhi is thrown off a South African train for being an Indian and traveling in a first class compartment. Ghandi had a tough time as most of us would, trying to understand racial inequality. Gandhi realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa. After numerous arrests and the attention of the world of which he didn't care for, the government finally relents by recognizing rights for Indians, but not for the native blacks of South Africa. After this victory, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now looked at as a national hero. He is pushed to take up the fight for India's independence from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and starts a non-violent, non-cooperation campaign on a very large scale, bringing together millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters and Gandhi's occasional imprisonment. Nevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is now divided. It is hoped that by encouraging the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will stop. Gandhi is opposed to the idea, and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first prime minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Gandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him. In the late 1800's South Africa, then Indian-British attorney Mohandas K. Gandhi takes up the cause of fighting what he sees as racially discriminatory laws against colored people such as himself and other ethnic Indians. Being that South Africa is part of the British Empire, he is hoping that news of such in the British press will support his cause. Although violence is used against him by the authorities, his protests are only by peaceful means. Having made a name for himself as a motivator of peaceful action which he does not want confused with passivity. There have been several others along with Ghandi, who sought peaceful means. When it comes to World Religions there are a few that would love the idea of a peaceful nation. And then there are those who have never known peace, and want no part of it.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review/ref=cm_cr_dp_wrt_btm?ie=UTF8&asin=B00190N4E4&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=2858778011&store=instant-video
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Beautiful love story. Not at all the norm. Very well written. Thought provoking. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I'm sleeping better than I have in years. It even drowns out the snoring of both my roommates! Also love the background option while I'm reading. I just hop for more sounds! Perhaps more packages on the app store of themed ambience to go with this one?
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Interesting storyline with myriad hidden object opportunities and rather childish other games. Graphics are very nice. Game is easy to finish in 3 to 4 hours.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|this game is sooooooooooo stupid. DO NOT get it you will hate it. it is the most boring game on earth. don't get any games from candy Rufus games.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|A lot of fun for me &amp; my girls!! And we can work together to figure things out. Loads of fun for all ages!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I have so enjoyed this series of comedies.  I have never seen a show that I have enjoyed more than this!!<br />I recommend for any adult for a great laugh!
B00957T6X6|4.0|This is a great series, but it is very brutal.  I would have preferred much less of a shock factor.  It is well written, and the story lines keep you hooked.  If you have a hard time following many things going on at once, then this book is not for you.  If you like things to be very complex and intriguing, then you should read this series.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|If you enjoyed Myst (or similar adventure games) you'll probably enjoy this game. The graphics and sound are beautiful. It is a relatively easy game and is pretty short. I played it all the way through in a few hours. Honestly, though, I don't have a lot of time to spend playing games, so I appreciate a game that I can actually finish. Some of the puzzles are kind of tricky, but most aren't too bad. There is a built-in hint system that I used a couple of times when I really got stuck. There's also a built-in map that is absolutely invaluable.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I love this show, and I watch it every Monday night, now if I get too busy I can always pull out the DVD and have a CASTLE marathon!<br />I recommend this show!
B002ZG99A4|3.0|This is one of the most violent movies I have seen in a while.<br />I could compare it to Aliens vs. Predators!!<br />I recommend for only mature audience
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|Love the music as much as the movie. Pleasant listening tunes so that you think you're in the shire with Bilbo.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|I just started watching this series and I have to say I love it!  I'm an RN in an ICU, and this show has more &#34;real&#34; situations than any other medical program I've seen.  I can actually recognize some of the medical scenarios and their treatments!...one would think that after working hard at the hospital all day (12 hour shifts), I would not even be interested in watching a medical program, let alone enjoy it!...GA is funny, sad, happy, realistic, and yes, sometimes unrealistic, but nonetheless, it gives me hope at the end of the hour....so addicting!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Fits perfectly, very secure and protects my Kindle very well.  Easy to remove to turn Kindle around to charge.  I would reccomend this to anyone looking for a decently priced case.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown captures the reader with every word. I couldn't put it down. The truth of our lives spoken in every work of his.....yet, is it the truth?
B001NLKWLW|5.0|A wonderful book! I was attracted to this title because I love the book \\"The Secret Garden\\" (different author) so I took a chance. I really enjoyed The Forgotten Garden, it is one of those books I will read again and again. I have since been reading Kate Morton's other works and find everything I've read to be vey high quality and wonderful reading.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|I like this around the holidays when everyone is tired of It's a wonderful life. Cary Grant is worth the price<br />of admission.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is definitely worth the read. You should ignore the bad reviews and read it for yourself. Some reviewers are just plain nasty, I don't know why?
B002RI9UBS|5.0|the way the book is written flows so well it makes for very entertaining and easy reading. the story is great and the movie that recently came out compliments the book perfectly
B009X00E18|2.0|I am very disappointed in this case!  When I open the case to use the Kindle, the Kindle is already on.  It seems just inserting  the device activates it.  Obviously, this isn't a good thing causing the device to need recharging frequently.  I regret buying it!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|We only know what we have been told. To be able to go back in time and still see people PEOPLE get hurt from with in.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book is stupid and it doesn't even make sense! I think this book deserves 1 star in rating it.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Matrix like after the first season, but Dr Bishop keeps it entertaining. I am however only halfway through the second season.
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|Colin is ok. But just not the same as Arnold. Some of the remakes just don't seem to be as good as the originals.
B00886XQO0|4.0|i thought it could be used in pc because when i play on ps3 with my friends we usually use skype for chat and that is a problem for me but in general I am satisfied with the product
B002ZG99NG|5.0|great movie, one of those movies, that you enjoy watching again!  I'm not a fan of Afleck, but love the movie
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I like the free books. Whats not to like. I would have never considered even reading the book so putting it in the line up was a good idea.
B000NY12LO|4.0|I felt sorry for the boy, even though he was a killer.<br />It made you realize what some kids and people go through<br />in life with these bullys.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This has been one of the best books I have ever read I hope to keep continuing on to the next series
B008IBPMZG|5.0|My wife and I really enjoy 'Downton Abbey'. It has a compelling story and well-rounded characters. My tastes in British television typically run to the likes of 'Monty Python', 'Mr Bean', and 'Doctor Who' but I'm happy I decided to branch out.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I must confess that the t.v. show is very graphic, in my opinion. It is what I consider one of my \\"guilty pleasures,\\" because although it is intense, it is also an awesome show. The relationships and the psychology of the crimes is what interests me. The actors routinely give superior performances, and the story-lines are intriguing. See what you think!
B00B2EWNWG|4.0|This movie was great. RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan acting, music & writing this. An old style kung Fu flick with a new up beat mix. I don't think it gets any better. A good story as done before with a new twist to step it up. Also don't forget the performance from Gladiators Russel Crowe. Still has the stick & move in this remake. I give it 2 thumbs up.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The story was very intriguing up to the very last.  The ending wasn't exactly what I would have liked but it was the only way it could turn out.  It is heartbreaking to know there are evil people in the world like the Cole cousins, but we do need to be reminded that everyone is not a peaceful loving person.
B0091LS07E|5.0|This is one CD everybody should have in their collection, love it from beginning to end and of course girl on fire is amazing.
B001XUJMZK|4.0|Great motion picture.  Looked good.  Mel Gibson as a director has an eye for casting that is his strong suit.
B001O1O71C|5.0|A German child makes &#34;friends&#34; with a Jewish boy living in a concentration camp.  The Jewish boy has lost his<br />innocence.  The German child has yet to understand the the scope of his father's job as one of Hitler's officers.<br />The story that unfolds is both tender and sad.  The two boys find the meaning of being true friends as innocence meets<br />reality.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I really like this game so much. That I can't stop playing it as much as I really want to!
B009H442DG|3.0|Not the greatest but for the most part okay and the proceeds went to good causes was hoping for better vocals John pretty much just talks instead of singing
B004UPANGM|4.0|This movie is a classic from Sam Raimi.  It has it all, horror, sex, laughs and a man beating the crap out of himself.
B004G6009K|5.0|Thank you for the well packaged item.<br />This was a christmas gift and it def was a hit.<br />Always nervous to order something like this and in the past have had items smashed in transit..<br />NOT this item, they take their time to package properly.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Pretty cool. Still not sure how I can get it all downloaded onto my device though. Nice added feature from Amazon.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This is a great story along with GREAT people involved. Dave Grohl is already such an influential person to myself and many more, this just made him even more awesome. I like that it goes behind the scenes that a lot of people never get to see and how much music recording and music in general have evolved in 40 years. Love it and recommending to everyone I know.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Saw this book on a chick-lit website so I thought I would give it a try. Great read! I hoped for a different ending BUT still worth the read.
B004UID2LC|3.0|this is not that great. you could just go to the youtube.com mobile webpage. on this app you can not choose a channel and look at there videos withch I found myself doing a lot on my phone. i think that this is only good for downloading music. and if you really want to watch vidieos go too the youtube mobile webpage.
098357670X|5.0|It tells you every you need to know about making caricatures from the theory through different types and technical advices ad the end! This book is a true value!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is way more fun than the original. There is way more variety in game play and scenery. I'm extremely satisfied with the quality of this game.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is by far one of my favorites.  I've purchased over 5 copies just to give as gifts so I can share the funny with others!
B0072PUC7W|5.0|My husband loves his music. Great music to chill out. Can't wait for his next CD. This is the best DJ ever.
0823023494|5.0|If you are at the level that you can draw what you want but you don't know how to build your own ideas, here's the book what you need!
B000BRBGO6|5.0|It's one of the greatest albums of Madonna. I love it so much! She always know that she  does it better!
B003VANOFY|2.0|well, i had high expectations of this headset.. i prefered it over the corsair vengeance 2000,  installation was easy, (used the latest software from the internet since the CD that comes with it is outdated), here are my notes<br />1)the battery life sucks.. i can barely get 5 hours of playing on it !!<br />2) the software is inaccurate, after it says fully charged it says 2 hours left in battery and they last for around 4 hours.. the battery indicator keep on changing !! in conclusion it's really inaccurate !<br />3) there's no EQ, still can't make them sound half as good as my older corsair vengeance 1500 !, the later have much better sound quality in audio and gaming ! and are far more comfortable !<br />4)It keeps on disconnecting ! every 5 minutes !
B003VANOFY|3.0|The main reason I give this headset three stars is because when it works, it's fantastic.  The sound is great, the mic is clear, it's got great range and is just overall a really good headset.<br /><br />The downside is that it will sometimes drop connection and the sound will cut out.  Sometimes just once, sometimes repeatedly.  I've heard that interference with wi-fi can be the issue, but I've tried every channel on my wireless router and nothing seems to make a difference.<br /><br />Long story short: buy the wired version and give this one a pass.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this was a great game and I could do so much more than a regular game I loved it.I could not believe how awesome it was
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The elegance, the style of communication, the impact of the &#34;outer&#34; or worldly events, and the interactions between those that have and have not... very good story.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The third season was particularly interesting and exciting.  It expanded on the &#34;other world&#34; idea which exposed so many possibilities.
0471413909|5.0|This is a great book, everyone should read as the way they are changing our foods today we have to go back to the way it used to be.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|dragon vale is awsome. it is a fun game where you raise different dragons and breed them. I recommend it to e erysipelas one
B0027BOL4G|5.0|If you want to know where your meat really comes from and what it's been fed before you eat it this is a great documentary.  I thank the farmers for participating in the film.  Some graphic slaughter house scenes, watch it when the kids are asleep.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|Love this Movie bigtime and will recommend it to anyone wanting to sit back and enjoy a great story with great actors!
B008IBP24C|5.0|Just because something is super popular doesn't mean that it isn't high quality. Downton Abbey is a good example of that. Give in and enjoy it!
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Great entertainment.  Can almost feel the electricity watching it!  Jimmy Page, Edge and Jack White......3 of the best.  Their love of creating music is well displayed in this movie.
B009CGYO0K|3.0|The book is pretty short - no more than an hour to go through it.  Content is not too great, either.  Definitely not his best work.  I'm OK that I paid 10 bucks for it because he has been making me laugh for years.  That said, if this was the first and only thing that I ever read of his, I'd be pissed.
B006O6F932|5.0|My daughter got this for Christmas and she loves to play with it and all her Monster High Dolls.  It folds up and stores well.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved it!!! Just don't read the book right before you go and watch the movie. It was to fresh in my head when I did and although the movie follows the book it doesn't exactly!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|This is story you can enjoy with entire family. I would highly recommend. The 4 star is for somewhat predictability of the plot.
B00005JO1R|5.0|Another Joaquin Phoenix vehicle.  He's brilliant in this - captures the essence of Johnny Cash perfectly.  He has the moves down, the voice perfected and that's his voice singing the songs, sounding remarkably like Johnny Cash.  I would have preferred he'd gotten the Oscar for best actor for this but, well..... can't have everything.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|I love this chip. I can run 4 mmorpg game clients maxed out and onbly hit 88% cpu usage with this chip.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Delivered on time at good price, Excellent read!!!!!!!!!!!! - - -- - - - - - - - - -
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy using this Bible application.  You can easy choose the book, chapter and verse. Most of all the ease of  changing versions.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Trying to find as many Joaquin Phoenix movies to watch, I finally, reluctantly acquiesced to watching Gladiator, even though I thought I'd hate it.....but it had Joaquin Phoenix in it.....and he was nominated for an Oscar for his performance.  so......ewwww.  I was pleasantly surprised and loved it.  I ordered if off amazon.com and took it over to Dad's place for him to watch and he was pleasantly surprised..  His comment, &#34;He sure went through a lot.&#34;  That wasn't Joaquin, but for Russell Crowe's character.  Every character in Gladiator was essential to the whole story, every line uttered was of utmost importance, it was so easy to keep my mind on the story - interesting when before I saw the movie, I thought it would be something I wouldn't have the least bit of interest in even thinking of trying to see if there was a way.....and I thought it'd be painful to watch.  Instead, I was transfixed throughout the movie.
B001OSIV62|3.0|The video quality was rather poor and blocked at points due to low resolution while streaming. However, the movie itself is rather good and watching this crazy french guy tight rope walk the twin towers is rather insane without any protection and doing so for over 45 minutes making multiple trips across the wire taunting the police in the process made this a thrilling documentary.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|THIS calculator plus is easy to operate and see. The function keys are easy to. Identify and use. Would recommend this calculator.
B000286RKW|5.0|I got this off Netflix specifically for Ray Liotta's performance (hot*hot) and amazingly enjoyed it enough that I bought it from amazon.com so I could watch whenever I wanted.  It tells the story of real life mobster, Henry Hill, and his journey through the mob life and how he finally broke free when his &#34;friends&#34; were about to kill him (or so he thought) and implicated those very friends.  The voice overs combined with stop-action photography was an interesting touch.  The commentary between the cop and the crook, (Henry Hill and the guy who got him into witness protection) was especially interesting, as Henry made many comments about how he felt during that time and the people he admired, and one could tell that the use of the F-word was second nature to Henry Hill.
B00865P3AS|5.0|These two cellists are a delightful breath of fresh air!!.  They are exploring  the possibilities of the cello and are inspiring many children to study the instrument.  Since I am a classically trained professional musician myself, I loved &#34;Benedictus&#34; which is astoundingly beautiful especially with Stjepan and Luka's exquiste interpretation.  The other music on the CD is fascinating and shows a wonderful creativity in making the cover music &#34;their own&#34;. I can't wait for their next album and hope they will be touring in the New York area.in the near future.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I are really enjoying this series. I won't usually watch dramas, but this has me hooked. Great story line, and cast.
0446364495|5.0|When I read this book years before I thought it was a true story.  I even went to the library to try to find the National Geographic issue mentioned in the book. (the library had them all).  When that issue had nothing about the bridges in it, that moment was when I realized this book was pure fiction.<br /><br />Francesca is a lonely housewife in Iowa.  Her family have gone off to the state fair to show her daughter's steer.  She is alone at the farmhouse when Robert Kincaid comes up her road to ask for directions to the covered bridges in the area.  What follows is a torrid love affair the likes one will never experience again.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|It is about a boy who went to a Valentine's day dance .HER AND US TROOPS ARE IN THIS TOGETHER.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator has a large screen and works perfectly. It's very easy to use and its free. I am now using it at my office instead of the calculator provided by my employer because of the large screen, brightness and easy to use buttons.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The book was incredible. Written from a child's perspective, I was engrossed from the beginning. I completely recommend it to everyone.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|A heartbreaking story of two young gay cowboys, who meet each other herding sheep on Brokeback mountain.  Down through the years, they get together twice a year, for some rest and relaxation.  Jack would love to get together and live together, but Ennis resists because of the social ramifications and an incident that happened when he was a young boy of barely nine years old.  I initially watched this movie because of the titillating nature of the subject matter, but halfway through, I started to understand this is much, much more than just a gay cowboy movie.  I bought it off amazon.com because I'd loved to be able to watch it whenever I wanted to.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|I liked that I could select my own stocks. It gave me the information I wanted. Easy to understand. Good graphs.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is awesome. In a world of Jersey Shore and other terrible reality shows, I took this show with a grain of sand and was extremely relieved and impressed. I watched all two seasons back to back and was glued and enjoying every minute.
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|I have not completed the series, but I am spell-bound by it so far.  I really like the settings and costumes.  Not too crazy about the language--a bit too much profanity for my taste.
B00000J2KX|5.0|the movie took way to long to get to me, but when it did i was very happy with the way it played
B003MC5N28|5.0|I went years before realizing The Giver was just the icing on the cake, all of the books are wonderful page turners.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Very happy with this box set....basically two movies per case, with each movie on it's own disc, so there are 4 cases in box...not much to box that holds the cases, but it does the job fine....only watched the first movie so far, and it looked great on my plasma, with some really cool extras...recommend highly.
0694003611|5.0|OK, cheesy title, but it's true.  Like many others, I didn't get the appeal of this book at first.  Once I read it to my son, though, it clicked.  It has an almost hypnotic quality that both of us find calming.  It's usually the last book before sleep and I can feel him settling down as we read.  It also helps his vocabulary as we point at all the different items in the little bunny's room.  Every child is different and some may not have the patience for such a simple book, so you may want to get it from your library before purchasing.  For us, though, it has a permanent place on our bookshelf.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book really related to real middle schoolers life . It's not exactly the way middle school is. But it's close
0470913029|5.0|This book is the miracle cure for almost everything.  It does make a lot of sense and if you look at the US as a whole versus other nations you can see the impact all this processed food is making on us.  It's definatley hard to to become accustomed to since we are so use to these drugs like sugar and caffiene we've been pumping into our systems.  It's one of those &#34;seems so simple&#34; fixes we always ignore.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is a great show that can be watched with the whole family. I watched the first season and was hooked! I recommend the UK version as it is not cut. You get every minute of the show that is available :)
B008YW5RH2|3.0|I like the game, but the swipe picks tbe worst times not to work. Very frustrating! I would like to give it 5 starsbut just can't because of that issue - don't enjoy playing anymore.
1423136802|5.0|I bought this for my 11 yr kid's Christmas. My kid loved it and I loved the price. What a bargain, compared to what need to pay at the book store for only 2 hard cover books, I got all five in one box. My kid loved the secret compartment in the bottom of the box and thought it was really from Santa.Recieved on time.Thank you.
B005HEQ864|5.0|This is a great show.  I wish there were more than 7 seasons.  I cant wait to start deep space 9.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is an awesome game.  I am quite surprised that it's so real looking. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Subject matter really not for me. Aside from that, the writing style really isn't that strong. That was very distracting for me.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|This game has many levels and is very challenging.  I also find it very addicting. Summarized - Fun, fun, fun!
B0053KWDES|4.0|Received the unit quickly.  The unit is about the length / width of a business card and about 1/2 deep.  Let me say the amp beat my expectations and offers phenomenal clarity and volume from both my HP PC and Android Samsung.  Really 5 stars for performance.  But, the little 3 inch cable with 90 degree plugs is a hassle and has a short so I've got to position it just right to work.  I've ordered 2 new m/m 6&#34; cables from cablemart for 2 bucks each to replace this one.  Print is so tiny in user guide that I didn't realize that it you can turn the unit off (volume control) to conserve power.  Hopefully, that will satisfy the issue with having to recharge every 5 to 9 hours.  I'm estimating you can play the unit continously for about 4 hours with full charge.  Still, I would recommend highly. For the price, you can't beat the performance
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A friend told me I should check out this series.  I don't watch much TV - hate advertisements - but watched season 1 followed by season 2 through my Amazon Prime.  Now, my mom wants to buy it, since she has no way to view A - prime where she lives.  I love the ending of the xmas special - just what I thought should happen.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed this read. Hard to put down. Consumed me for two busy days. Snuck a read every chance I could squeeze in. Highly recommend.
B00499NHLC|5.0|great modern adaptation of Sherlock Holmes. Characters are very familiar with a modern twist. Can't wait to watch next season
B006LSZECO|5.0|At first it seemed like just an average suspense story. But once it got going, it took off. Just when you think you got it figured out, there's a twist and a turn that throws you back to square one. This is one of the few books I did not want to put down. Can't wait for Gillian Flynn's next one. Sequel?
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Typical DeMille book...hard to put down. Another great story about John Corey and his trials and tribulations. Keep them coming!
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|The story line is a good idea, that could actually happen in real life, so that makes you think.  But it drags at times.
0345803507|5.0|Love this series, read it together with my husband (my own 50 shades), brought an erotic, sensual side to our relationship that after 18yrs married I thought was gone! Love the descriptive way EL tells 50's story through Ana's eyes, it is very provocative, sexy & I just cant ride in an elevator the same way anymore!!<br />MUST READ!!!
B005PK56TA|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed season one......not boring at all; loved the twists!!  The story line was exciting and not predictable.  I wish season two would have been as enjoyable.  Can't wait to see what transpires in season three.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love Downton Abbey, the era of change and wealth.  This show is so visually appealing, The period clothing, vehicles and scenery make this a top choice for viewing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best game EVER because you can do anything and you can get lots of different types of power in the game
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Right up there with cut the rope. very addictive time killer. I highly recommend this game, especially if you can get it free.
B009NOVCTM|3.0|50 cuts, and they couldn't find room for \\"She's So Cold\\"?!? [But they DID make room for a remake of Chuck Berry's \\"Come On\\"?!?] Just like REM's Best Of CDs, this album could & should have been done better, and not omitted key cuts/hits.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed playing this. It's not too challenging but fun. I've been disabled for six weeks....it's entertainment.  I'd like the full game so maybe I'll end up purchasing it.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|its a thicker cable that fit tighter. It should come with all kindles. my problem was the kindle not the charger
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't usually write reviews but I will start now. I never realized how much I read them and how much they help me pick my next book or series.  If no one wrote reviews than I would be lost. So I promise to start now.<br />This book was awsome. I couldn't put it down.  I couldn't believe the storyline it was so great and came together so good.  Ofcourse i'm a sucker for a deep intense love story.
B001IWV030|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. If you're overly sensitive about a white actor portraying a Chinese character for laughs then this movie might not be for you. I'm a horrible person so I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|I am so happy I watched this movie. Ben Kingsley does a wonderful job portraying Gandhi. I really enjoyed the way Richard Attenborough has done this film. Richard starts his film with a little foreshadowing, then moves on to the start of Gandhi's great work. Beginning in 1893, Gandhi boards a train to South Africa as a young attorney. He is thrown from the train for refusing to ride in 3rd class, because he is from India (colored man). This sparks something in Gandhi. Gandhi and the Indian Congress of South Africa begin with one small goal to become equals in the British Empire. The first protest in the movie are straight and to the point. Gandhi begins to show that he can also humble himself and become equal with the other Indians in South Africa. When he returns to India, he is greeted with praise for what he has done while in South Africa. During Gandhi's trek through India, he begins to see the struggles of the Indian people caused by the British Empire rule. With the British Empire promoting Hindu against Muslim in India, Gandhi makes it his life goal to promote non-violence and peace in India. With every fast, and every demonstration, Attenborough does a wonderful job of letting you see into Gandhi's mind. Gandhi's wife's devotion even tugs at the heartstrings. This movie gives you a good look at how religion can affect so much. Even the Indian National Congress was thought of to have a common goal to be a home ruled empire, but in the end Hindu and Muslim take sides. As the powerful argue, the Indigenous suffer. This movie had me talking about it for hours. Gandhi's work was portrayed in a good, but unbiased light. Even today, India and Pakistan struggle, but the world knows Gandhi. I only wish that everyone could comply with Gandhi's teachings.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I like having a Bones Episode on hand when TV programming is poor. Living in the Midwest we are often home bond and ned ready entertainment. This is always my first choice! Quick service and product as promised.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I have read this book over and over throughout my life, and I get something different out of it each time.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I don't mind when developers charge for ingame perks and items. They deserve to be paid for their work if it's good. But when a game forces me to recruit my friends or to friend strangers in order to advance, that's where I draw the line. Sorry, if it weren't for that I'd continue to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game ! I like having a daily challenge they have a daily challenge<br />every day you have to pass. If you cant pass it you can spend your<br />coins and pass.it! I would buy this game it is.fun!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is the best book ever. Rick Riordan is awesome.The chapters' names were funny. One of them are Grover unexpectedly loses his pants. That's a funny name. If you like these book you should read the Eragon books. If you go read Eragon, don't just read the first 5 chapters and say ohh the book is soo boring. OKAY?!?!?!?!?
0525478817|5.0|One of my students lent me her copy of this book, and I devoured it.  I had to own my own. The characters are funny, sad and wonderful all at the same time.  I look forward to cherishing this book for years to come.
B0015ABRE2|3.0|The season three is great and exciting.  The second DVD skips which is disappointing.<br />I rate this product as a 3
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|Bought this as a gift for a nephew, he loves it and he gets positive feedback. I love the look.
159514188X|4.0|This book addresses an issue that seems to be so difficult for students to talk about, whether they feel as if no one will understand or they are just unsure of how to bring it up. This story should be made available to teens in classrooms and libraries across the country. It is too often that cries for help are overlooked and may result in a young person taking their own life. Making this text available to young people may help them see that they are not alone and there are other options.<br />  Some may wonder how this text could possibly be incorporated into a curriculum. There are many ways to use this text in a classroom setting. I would recommend that this book be used with high school students. You may choose to use it as a whole-class read or in a smaller group setting. Multiple perspectives can be studied through using this book. The text pattern of the two narrators is powerful and allows the reader to actively connect with two characters. This could be beneficial to students who are either having feelings about suicide or for those who are dealing with friends with those feelings. Powerful discussions could arise through the reading of this story and students could possibly create a PSA after the completion of the story to make others aware of teen suicide. Overall, I feel this story is an eye opener and brings a topic to the table that is commonly pushed aside and ignored. The truth is that our students do have these types of feelings, and they are real. We have to address the issue, rather than run from it.<br />  Although a powerful and engaging story, the use of this book could cause some controversy. The incorporation of sex and alcohol may make some feel uncomfortable. This could possibly prevent some teachers from choosing to use this story as a whole- class read, unless they feel their students are willing enough to address these issues in a mature manner. Maintaining control and having a powerful classroom facilitator, teacher or student, will keep conversations and analysis appropriate.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I found this book to be stimulating.  I plan to use it in my career as a teacher, as well as just in my personal relationships with friends and family.  Made me look at life differently, in a good way.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|I can get over the fact that half the movie is fiction because Affleck had to make the movie more exciting,but my problem with the movie is that it is just a marginally exciting suspense thriller.<br /><br />Most of the movie is just boring with a made for TV feel to it.<br /><br />It is still a good movie which shows a very historical crisis in US history but to give Affleck any kind of award for best director or any other nomination is a total joke.<br /><br />If you want to watch a great terrorist movie buy Munich or The Kingdom,which are much more entertaining than this.
B00B19DMUE|5.0|Excellent Story line, actors performances were all very well done. Ending left open door to sequel. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is an eye oppener on why we need to improve our eating habits...it is up to us, it is about what we put in our mouths...it is something that we can control strating right now!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|What a magnificent way to recreate those times. Very good screenplay. Excelent actors. The contrast betweem two ltfestyles is very well driven.
0060160276|5.0|This is a great story of courage and fortitude.  A must read for anyone you enjoys true life adventures or just likes to read about them
030759565X|5.0|I own many cookbooks from French to Italian to the basics. I find a few recipes in each that I love and return to....but this one is the BEST!<br /><br />Practical ,realistic, easy to follow and delicious recipes. The pictures make it a joy to plan your menu. Easy dough recipes and the breakfast suggestions are fabulous.<br /><br />I am not saying it is the only cookbook you need. But if you don't want to experiment you can count on these recipes to work every time.<br /><br />I have learned a lot from so  many others but this is the one I will give as a gift for every occasion I can think of just because it is so worth sharing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a lot like Minecraft. Redstone is not in yet but otherwise it is perfect! Get it if you like minecraft.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much cooler than the first one. I recommend it to anyone even slightly interested in temple run
1564021017|5.0|One of my favorite books to read aloud to preschoolers.  The illustrations are beautiful and realistic.  The story is sweet and loving, and the children love the predictability.
1616550414|5.0|My daughter loved it. She read it from cover to cover, it two days. I would advise it for anyone who loves Legend of Zelda.
B004AQR24W|3.0|Typical Stallone film. Stathom was great but I could have re-cast everyone else. Good fight scenes, just not great acting.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game so very much. The one thing I don't like is the lag. I have been to several different places and played it, but, it never stops!
B000WS4P5G|5.0|For those who are new to the work of Glenn Danzig this is really a good place to start. As compared with Glenns lengthy and astounding carer including the misfits and samhain this is a great place to start as i said before. Here is a rundown of the tracks and just why thet are great.<br />1. Twist of cain: Great starter for the record and originally a samhain demo. THe opening riff is so catchy snd glenn comes in with that iconic scream. Very Doomy but hard edged at the same time finally ending with an amazing drum break down from Drummer Chuck Bicuits.Lyricaly very much in the vein as samhain.<br />2. Not of this world: Another great opening riff snf Glenns vocals shine again here. There is a great bridge John christ that makes for a nice build up for the chorus thats very powerful. Lyrically again allof these song feel like samhain songs...well more near November coming fire than intium or unholy passion. When i listen to this record it really seems like this could have easily been samhain 4 had names not been changed.<br />3. She rides: Very down and dirty blues song. Very very sexual.<br />4. Soul on fire: Starts very slow and kind of ominus but builds into a powerfull verse and even more so chorus. Very powerful vocals on this song inparticular.<br />5. Am i demon: Very fast song, almost thrashy with a great technical solo by john Christ.<br />6.Mother: Anyone who knows this song then...i dont have to say anything, it speaks for itself.<br />7. Possesion: Anothe left over samhain track. Like Twist of cain its much more polished. Lyricaly this is one of the more darker songs.<br />8. End of time: Very slow song, lyrically this could almost passa as a ballad but im still not sure.<br />9. The Hunter: Mid paced song, almost feel like the record is staring to wind down a little.<br />10. Evil thing: Another mis paced song. A good closer.<br /> thats all for now thanks
0316223239|4.0|Much like To Kill a Mockingbird, Emma Donoghue's Room uses narration to construct a relatable, understanding, and sometimes even humorous relationship between book and reader. This is a compelling and artfully-depicted representation of an unthinkable situation. Told from the perspective of her son, the simplistic language appeals to English Language Learners and those struggling with literacy comprehension. It touches upon the subjects of kidnapping and rape in a tasteful and subtle way, and can therefore be presented to English or Psychology students upwards of ninth grade.<br /> This novel would be very successful in a unit centered around perception. Jack, the five-year-old narrator, has a naive take on the atrocious acts going on around him, and can therefore bring forth meaningful discussions about the world through a child's eyes. Activities and debates about the nature of good and evil could also be incorporated-as the relationship between Jack and adults in the outside world become increasingly complicated. In an English class, this can be used as a supplemental text alongside a more difficult work, like Shakespeare or Beowulf. Potentially, students could re-write portions of these more complicated texts in a voice similar to Jack's- in order to break it down as well as add a bit of their own voice.<br /> Incorporating this text into an English class would have a lot of benefits. In addition to its ability to support more complicated texts, it could also be transferred across multiple content areas. The mental health of the three major players (as well as the issue of Stockholm Syndrome) could be analyzed in a psychology class, while the reign of the kidnapper could easily be compared to a tyrant ruler in a History or Social Studies class. Additionally, if used in an advanced-placement class, the modern sex trade could also be discussed in conjunction with the story of Jack's mother, Ma.<br /> While very useful in the classroom, it is key to be sensitive towards the more mature issues presented in this text. To many students, this could be a very disturbing and stressful story, however blatantly talks about a pertinent issue that is highly informational to our students.
0307359913|5.0|The book was in great condition and it met all of my expectations. Great buy for me! I would definitely recommend this book and the place from which I purchased it.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Difficult to read and follow at first but I enjoyed reading this story of spiritual battles and the battle to survive lost at sea of this young Indian man. Excellent read
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Was not expecting the performance that I am receiving on this unit.  Primarily being used for an HTPC running Windows 8 and Media Center.  Onboard video works amazing, not hiccups at all so far.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Really enjoyed this show.  After the first 2 episodes I wasn't sure I was very interested in it but I decided to keep watching and I got hooked.  Since then I've watched the next 4 seasons over 2-3weeks.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Must watch documentary. Really opened my eyes to what I was eating. The part I don't agree with is the family that says out is cheaper to eat off the dolliar menu than eat healthy. Its just laziness that is making america fat.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My kids love the movie, we could not wait to purchase it! Vampires are so popular now, I wondering what is next?
B003M70O5O|5.0|Great cast, great motorcycles, great rides, great plot, great flow, gotta love all the characters, and miss those that die.
B00AAX68HG|3.0|I was a huge fan of Cut the Rope... but sadly this isn't the same caliber. I wanted to love it, but there isn't anything innovative about it. In fact, if you ever played Quell before, you'd agree with me. Cut The Rope set the bar too high for this. Better luck next time Zeptolab.
B009POCFTG|5.0|I was reading other reviews for this movie and just had to comment. Alot of the reviews for this movie talk about it like it is so dark that it will scar you for life after you see it. Trust me it won t. It is definitively violent,definitely sexy,(lots of nudity) and most definitely funny. It is also one of Mc connehey s best movies.  If you're an adult its a great movie.
B003Y5H4Y8|3.0|The acting in this movie was good, but otherwise the movie is rather blah.<br /><br />Three Israeli agents try to bring a German war criminal back to Israel for trial, but some things go wrong and he gets away.  They figure he'll stay in hiding and no one will know he got away, so they lie and say they killed him and hid the body.  Three decades of lying haunts them until he starts to resurface and may tell what happened.  The outcome of that is bad for everyone concerned, to varying degrees.<br /><br />OK, so what?  No big life lessons here.  No fascinating twists or suspense in the plot.  Not a lot of great action either.<br /><br />Overall, a somewhat dull and disappointing movie.  More style than substance, and not so much of the former either.  Not recommended.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book was a good and quick read as all Nicholas Sparks books are. Simple characters and simple plots. However, this is not an original story line. There was a movie out back in the early 90's (if my memory serves me correctly) called Sleeping With the Enemy starring Julia Roberts. Very similar plot. So you can imagine the disappointment I had. There is no surprise element to the story. Very predictable. (I had already seen what seemed like the movie) A damsel in distress book. Girl with troubled past meets the all American bachelor. Simple life with tragedy in his past. She reveals herself he saves her blah blah happily ever after. Now if you have never seen this movie, it will likely be a good read for you. Of course, a love story where the man saves the woman, they fall in love and live blissfully in a small town with his two children always has a happy ending.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|Ok... I first downloaded this app in place of Lightning Bug on because my Kindle was \\"incompatible\\" with it (has since changed- so I digress). I went from having 200+ sounds to 94. Don't get me wrong, the interface here is easier to navigate than L.B., and the sound quality is equally as good... but I'm trying to recreate a 'similar' experience with less sound bytes.<br /><br />HOWEVER- I feel this app could potentially be just as good as L.B. because: it's one or two updates away from 1) getting a more robust selection of sounds, and 2) fixing the glitch that causes the program to force close when you try to add your current mix to \\"favorites\\". Will give 5 stars when fixed.
B0074JODP8|5.0|We really enjoy listening to Joe Bonamassa.  Saw this first on PBS and just had to stop what we were doing and watch and listen.  Bought this copy to give as a gift.

B008Y78M60|5.0|My wife and I enjoy movies regarding historical events from our Nation's history.  This film was outstanding with excellent character development and plotting.  We highly recommend it.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Magical and engaging. A good book for a snowy winter day. I look forward to more writings from this author.
8866131121|5.0|I love the entire Moleskine line. This Planner is super helpful because I get a whole page for each day. I have my appointments, my errands list, reminders, etc., and I take it with me everywhere. Smart phones are great, but I was wasting a lot of time typing all of the minutia of my day. Love the pocket and the blank pages at the back of the book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Enjoyed this story and the lesson behind it- so I'll definitely recommend it got a friend! Katie & Alex are amazing!
1451695195|5.0|I bought this book as a gift and the recipient enjoyed it very much.  Very comforting to those who have lost loved ones.
B006ZS4G24|1.0|I bought this b/c my sister said my niece wanted it. I just assumed that I was paying what it listed for. Turns out that it lists for $25 but these guys sold it to me for $60 b/c it was hard to find during the holidays. Such a ripoff.
B005NJU8PA|1.0|I felt like I had the summary copy, never learned a thing and it wasn't entertaining.  A very strange book
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would so get this game if I were you.  My favorite thing is all the gold/BUTTER.  You are a fool if you don't like this game.  In the new update 0.6.1 they axed cool new stuff like armour and...  well you will just have to find out for your self.  BUTTER!!!!!!
030758836X|2.0|And then.... it never happened.  How do you leave two loose ends like Greta and Jeff out there who could totally unravel her lies and then NOT write that into the ending?  She gets away with it?  So why not finish the story with her return falling into his arms?  Everything after that was pointless!  I would have much rather been left thinking - \\"what happened!?\\" than knowing how she got away with it!!! Grrr.
1451695195|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was not exactly what I expected because I have read other books regarding afterlife experiences.  This one was very different but it was good to get a doctor's perspective who has had an experience like this.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy this game the further you get the more you have to thibk about it. It works well on my Kindle Fire hd.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is a really fun game to play. I would definitely  recommend it to my friends. It does have some scary parts so children beware! Wish it wasn't so expensive though.... $3 is plenty!
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Entertaining and fun to read, with some new characters and twists that add further colour to the already colourful Vorkosigan/Barrayar universe. Not really serious literature, but exactly what I wish for on a long flight.
B00138H6I2|5.0|Great price and easy to download.  Enjoy listening to music from bygone days.  Billy Joel at his best! Great buy
B0039YZPZ4|5.0|I will qualify my review by first stating that I would NOT be considered a fan of Sherlock Holmes.  Other than this movie, I've never watched any of the series on TV, nor do I believe that I have ever read any of the Sherlock Holmes books.  Overall, I just found this movie to be very entertaining, with a good story, some good acting, and good special effects.  Surprisingly, my 9 year old daughter sat down mid-way through the movie, and stated how much she liked it.  So, we went back and watched the whole thing again, and at the end her comment was, &#34;I LOVE THIS MOVIE!&#34;  So, we're very much looking forward to watching the sequel in the very near future.<br /><br />All that said, if you are a hardcore Sherlock Holmes fan, you MAY not enjoy this movie as much as we did.  As I said, I am NOT a die hard Sherlock Holmes fan, but I had a couple of friends of mine comment that they didn't really like this movie, but recommended the BBC series instead (also available on Amazon On Demand).  So, I have a feeling the movie may stray a bit from the classic Sherlock Holmes.  So, I am now also going to check out the BBC series as well, but I wouldn't let those comments dissuade you from checking this movie out.<br /><br />As a note - this is a movie probably best watched in a dark room with the sound turned up.  There are quite a few dark scenes in the movie, and it can be a bit difficult to see in a brightly lit room.  In addition, the characters also whisper / talk under their breath more than usual in a movie.  So, if you're not prepared for that, you may miss what they're saying (some of which is particularly entertaining), especially with British accents.
034580404X|5.0|Heard about this book from several friends so decided to read it.  Some times it was hard to put down.
B004L3AR0K|4.0|Funny! Funny! Funny.....A difficult subject that was handled with love and care.  Jake & Anne are a stunning duo. Yea!
B0081336FO|5.0|Besides reading the books this is the Best Sherlock there is! Can't wait for season three and beyond, which there better be!
B00APJLX8E|4.0|This review is for the Amazon On Demand version of the movie, so I can't comment on the value of the DVD or Blu-Ray.  In short, the movie is cute.  My wife loved it, as did my 9 year old daughter.  That said, I think it might be tailored slightly more for girls than boys, as though my son liked it, neither he nor I LOVED it.  It was good, certainly worth watching, and I'm sure any child 10 and under with thoroughly enjoy it.  However, I don't know that it's worth owning (though for some reason I do find the &#34;I don't say Bla Bla Bla&#34; bit particularly funny).
B009GQ57ES|5.0|this is an excellent album. great production, great sound, great lyrics. serious when it needs to be, silly when it needs to be. definitely worth checking out. get it.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|It's mostly predictable but it's entertaining to watch.  On season 3 but still not grabbing me.  (i hate this review processing requiring ppl to write more words or it won't let you submit.)  Purely waste of my time and taught me a lesson not to write reviews
B0072GPQNG|5.0|You can't beat this for being a wonderful story. It makes you laugh, sigh and cry. You won't be sorry if you buy it. I promise. I confess to being an animal lover big time.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Greatest CD of all times.  Foo Fighters are just incredible.  Every one of their cd's just keep getting better by the CD.
1451695195|5.0|This is a unique book and I highly recommend it, especially for skeptics.  I already believe in an afterlife, but reading this book was very good, because of Dr. Alexander's understanding of the brain through his many years as a neurosurgeon. His family story is very heart warming, too.  His descriptions of his &#34;adventures&#34; when brain-dead are beautiful and exciting.  It's a very hopeful book.
B004F77SHC|1.0|This gift set was advertised as containing the component of collectible cards, but is missing all except the DVDs. To be explicit and reiterate, this set contained: DVD Cover and Eclipse DVD; Missing contents: collectible cards. Don't purchase this if you are planning on enjoying the collectible cards that come with this, because IT DOES NOT HAVE IT.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is even better than subway surfers it has a lot more colors and very tropicalish and there's this on character that looks just like a hula dancer but has a lot more colors on and lots of feathers
1475972350|5.0|You MUST read this book! It is a roller coaster ride of thrills and chills. I was captured by the first page and held spellbound until the end (all in one day I might add). If you love murder mysteries or thrillers, you definitely want to get this book!!!!!
0062011847|5.0|Was a Christmas gift and definatly hit a home run. Recipient couldn't wait to start reading it and appreciated a book to add to their collection.
1565847032|5.0|I find it difficult to use Chomsky as a source because he is feeding the readers an analysis from his own laborious, tedious research. But, Understanding Power provides a whole list of citations and footnotes that Chomsky references and bases his conclusions upon. The reader can dig deeper into these issues and draw conclusions similar to Chomsky's, which is why I love this guy. He understands that speaking in terms that the layman may not understand will not amount to any progress, and this is seen in Noam's clarity. Also, like Foucault, Chomsky does not have an agenda or &#34;side&#34;; rather, he's engaging in institutional analysis to understand the manner of things, how the system works. The world is a certain way, and it can change, as it always is. However, it is up to us to guide it in the right direction, and Chomsky provides the reader with the tools and understanding on how to do so. Great read, easy to pick up, open a page at random and learn something meaningful.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|I agree with the positive reviews that have been written. As an engineering student, I wanted a precise, no-nonsense stylus that would last. This is just that. It is not too heavy for jotting diagrams and solving math or physics problems, however, I could understand if someone were writing extensive text it could become heavy. It is as precise as I could hope for with a capacitive touch stylus (which are inherently less precise than pencil and paper, btw; you'll never find a stylus with that level of precision given the current technology). It also seems nice and chunky for kids, although I wouldn't really trust my toddler with my iPad and (essentially) a heavy aluminum rod for more than two seconds.<br /><br />I tried the bamboo stylus and thought it a little too squishy for my tastes, plus did not like the many complaints that it wore out easily. The cosmonaut seems built to last.<br /><br />I gave it 4/5 stars for this reason: I reserve 5/5 stars for products that blow me away and make me excruciatingly happy. I am very pleased with this product, was not at all disappointed with it (no unmet expectations). However, it didn't blow me away; it was pretty much exactly what I thought it would be. So 4/5.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I have had my Satechi Soundfly AUX for about nine-months and I don't know how I lived without it! It is plugged directly into the lighter socket. I love the Soundfly AUX, there is virtually no wait time to hear the music, it starts when the car starts, the sound is wonderful - there is no static at all, there are settings to set the sound as you like it, it is simple to use.  You can use both an SD card or thumb drive as your music storage.<br /><br />I have not used the remote so I can't comment on it. I did have to call their tech support and they were wonderful as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Satechi Soundfly AUX.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This game is deff worth your time its amazing!!!! you slide around the pannels and get the sleepy moonboy to his bed!! its great for a time waste and i go on alot of car trips so its a great way to have fun on a boring ride to wherever. :-)
B009FZHYKU|1.0|is free in other places , if you charge at least one dollars  no non no no no no no
1419705849|5.0|My son loves this book and I loved being able to order it in advance. He goy to read the book before any of his friends did.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great performance Denzel once again. Awesome visual effects and entertaining. A very powerful movie for a reality check on someone battling the alcohol disease.
B005PK553C|3.0|had so much potential to be so much more, but fell flat, especially the finale. if i had it to watch over again, not sure that i would
0609610570|2.0|I have not had the time to read this book as of yet, it was recommended to us in our class while we were training.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Love the game.  Tons of hours of fun fun fun gameplay.  I recommended this to anyone with hands Lol<br />Justin
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I'm not going to tell the story as some reviewers did. That would ruin the story. I had no idea what I was getting into and that's the best way to fall into this story. Only to say that it's about a 16 year old boy who wanted to know more about his grandfather's past. Who doesn't? Except that his gave him instructions with his dying breath to find it. I loved it and couldn't stop reading and it takes you from Florida to the UK. I wish there were more pages. I like big books and this isn't, that's why I have a Kindle Fire, so I'm not carrying around a lot of extra weight. I only had trouble reading 1 letter. The photos did give it more of a sense of \\"reality\\" in a totally strange world for this teenage boy. While some people compared it to superhero movies..I thought of Doctor Who.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game, way too addictive. Should be cooking dinner, not playing this on my Kindle Fire. No more to say, etc, etc, etc, etc, etc,
B0049IHX2C|5.0|This as given to my son also for christmas so that he could complete his collection that he has been wnting to do for a long time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|True to form, Nicholas Sparks captivates the reader with his intricate storytelling and thrilling details. With this pure love story, I was wrapped up in the characters and the plot from the first page to the last.
B0000029AL|5.0|This was their very first album, which debuted back in 1973 and celebrates it 40th anniversary this year. I found this one at Strawberries in April of 2011, and what a find it was! Steven describes the album as \\"bare bones - it's just us and a guy playing sax on Mama Kin and that's it\\", but that's all you need - the band and the music. If you're driving down the highway and you've got \\"Walkin' The Dog\\" CRANKIN', do like Steven Tyler says and \\"Roll down the window, and let the world in on your little secret\\". This is one album that is a must-have for every every Aero Addict out there. I don't care what people say -<br />AEROSMITH is here to stay!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A must read!!! As a American I have been sheltered by the spilled blood and sacrifices of the servicemen and women of America. Past, present and future. It is a debt that I cannot repay that being said I humbly say thank you and God bless you and your families. I read this book after being so dumbstruck by Chis Kyle's death. I am glad I did, God bless you and rest in peace. A truly senseless tragedy.
B00007E8O5|5.0|Just simply a great album. This is a hard, heavy album. If you enjoy Alice In Chains, you're gonna love this!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Bought this replacement cable for my Kindle DX. It fit into the adapter and my DX well and charges perfectly. Great price too.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Very good movie and downloaded well to my sony blu-ray player. Picture was excellent and the movie itself was very entertaining!
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great work Mr Child as always. Gripping and twisty plot that keeps you guessing all the way through it :)
B008PZZFHA|4.0|cuss words and all the gang of South Park.  If you like South Park, you will like this extended episode. Difinitely  NOT recommended for children.
B000062V9C|2.0|I loved the movie, that is why I ordered it. Sadly when it arrived at my home it was for the wrong region or something and I had no way of watching it and had to send it back and therefore lost money on it. Wishing it had been the right DVD cause I do love this movie.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Looks and plays great on nexus 7, and galaxy s3.  Challenging but not hard.  One of the better app of the days so far.
0761163808|5.0|This book was bought for our two grandsons aged 5 & 3. They love it and I am sure it will be on show at their school.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so addictive...I love it! The levels progress from super easy to extremely hard. The more you play, the more possibilities you see in each puzzle.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is a great little movie. It is so cute and yet has a lot of meaning to it. I really enjoyed watching it. And will watch it again and again.
B004HD61KE|3.0|A fast paced read, with some interesting geological/historical facts tossed in about volcanos, but a bit too far fetched in the science fiction, end of the world underpinings of the story, and the escapes from impossible situations were too implausible for a serious reader
B0073COMKW|3.0|Received bulbs as promised.  Only problem is one of the bulbs id not work and i could not get a replacement, so i had toreturn all four bulbs, since I was using them as a set in my house.  Not really a problem, but I did not want to pay shipping for one bulb, so i returned the set.
B0084B1T8Y|4.0|Having only ever seen the animated version of The Jungle Book was a real pleasure to read this. Not the sort of book I would normally choose but really liked the relationship between the boy and the animals and how the animal relationships in the jungle worked. Short stories too mad this an easy read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a really good book. It is also way better than the movie!!! I can't wait to read the next one!!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Like many others, I wanted to read this book before going to see the movie with friends. I am not a huge Nicholas Sparks fan so I had my doubts. Honestly, it surprised me how much I liked it. I was even surprised by some of the plot twists.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|After seeing the movie \\"Jack Reacher\\", I thhought I'd try reading the first of the Reacher series. Great read! I'm going on to the third in just one week.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I Just Like it , it has a lot of helpfil infomation. what else can i say besides that okay
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, and I was pleased by the movie. Catching Fire comes to theatres 11-22-13 And all of the original cast members are still the same (to my understanding)
B0010SKSTO|4.0|This book is packed with information and common sense for the counsellor and lay person alike.  I highly recommend it.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is addicting! There are so many different levels you won't be bored!! I have recommended this game to my friends and co-workers.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. A real good play for anyone on break, lounging, or just for having fun. Good for all ages.
1594202842|5.0|This book is one of my favorites. I went through it quickly. The comparisons between Asian and American parenting are interesting.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Easy to apply to all stages of marriage. A beneficial read. Steps to learn what language you and your spouse speak.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was realistic about abused women.I couldn't put it down. I have recommended the book to my friends. I enjoy this author and his style of writing.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book is sooooooooooooo boring...it makes me want to fall asleep,I hate this book it's so stupid :( stupid stupid stupid!!!!!!!!!
B009DH371K|5.0|Fantastic. Audio and visual quality were great.  Showcases a great band.  Enjoyed the &#34;off camera spots with each of the members.  They were/are a great performing group, always keeping the audience involved in the music.  Freddie knew what it meant to be an entertainer.  Couldn't ask for better!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is worth the download<br />cool get it done. metal rules! takes the boredom away.<br />do work. watch netflix nerds
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is so much fun at first I wasn't so sure about it but now I'm like totally in love with it!
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|I'm still trying to get the gist of this movie.  I think the premise is very good, and has a good story to it, but I will admit that I got a little lost.  Probably viewing it a few more times will be key!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app, I can connect and find any version of the bible, extremely easy to use, love it using it at church.
B0091REZMW|5.0|The graphics are great.  A lot of fun. A great way to spend spare time. Better than many other games I've played of the same type.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I liked this series and when I began watching it but it was already in the fourth series so I did purchase Season 4 as that was the only one I couldn't find locally.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book!  The story is told from the point of view of the dog.  The plot is well thought out, and easy to follow.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I like it so much because I love zoo games and zoo anything! My favorite animal is the elephant!! Even in real life it is!!!!!
1250007208|5.0|I seriously held no doubts as to the quality of this &#34;first&#34; book of Marissa Meyer, as I have been a fan of her fanfiction for *years* and she is one of the main authors of the Sailor Moon fandom. This book was *amazing* and anyone whose a fan of Sailor Moon would instantly recognise the inspiration behind this novel. Nevertheless, the romance, the fantasy, the *realistic* portrayals of personalities and family relationships drew me in, and I finished this book within 2 hours...due to uni committments....I recommend this book to *everyone* as this book can be read by a child through to an adult,
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I enjoyed listening to these old classics. I bought them for my grandson and he was thrilled with them. I'm sure he will enjoy them for a long time.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|after installing the otterbox on my phone I have dropped it Twice, once it bounce down 3 concrete steps! Otterbox did it's job, my phone didn't have a scratch on it and is working just fine.
B009X01GJ2|4.0|It would make sense if the charging outlet could be accessed from the closed cover without having to rotate the device.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works great, is fun and works very well on the Kindle. Can play different games and is a great distraction and keeps the brain exercised!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I gave this book 5stars cuz it was hereditary good I recommend it to any bod<br />Y who likes r j palacio
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We love this show and have watched the episodes several times. Wonderful acting, funny, sad, and the history is valuable for learning. Hope this show continues for a long, long time!
B009GFEOY8|2.0|Unfortunately, four of the eight photos did not process/expose?  I'll buy from Impossible again and hope for a fresh batch.
B004GTQ4DI|5.0|After watching the Lark Rise to Cranford series and loved it I had to see this series too. This is a well acted and written series and Judy Dench was a delight as well as all the other actors. I didn't want it to end as you get attached to the characters, cheering them on and hoping for the best for them. These series have no sex, or horrible violence, no special effects either. Just wonderful acting and great story telling. The whole family can enjoy this series.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Story continues to keep the reader entertained.  The author does a superb job weaving history with rich personal stories.  A must read
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I actually like this to wake up to better than my alarm clock. Great yto use when traveling and love all the options!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Smart show with a great cast that works well together.  Alot of the supporting cast members steal their scenes with witty ad libs!
B008K8VDPU|3.0|This is a challenging game. I love music and I enjoy trying to play up to speed.Give it a try.
B00821OX98|5.0|Once I started watching  this series I could not stop until I was all the way  through season 2.  It is a great show!  If you like theTV show The Walking Dead you will certaintly enjoy Falling Skies as both series deal with human nature and responses to the human race being under attack.  It is very well produced with a great cast.<br />I normally shy away from science fiction but not this show.  Each episode leaves you hanging in suspense.
B008Y6WPXC|3.0|Lots  of action , so so acting as usual in a show like this , not serious but entertaining.<br /> This show was worth watching.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|From balancing the checkbook to the kids' trig homework, this is the app to have. Easy to read graphics as well.
B000W94FIW|5.0|A very thoughtful<br /> and inspirational afternoon read!  It frees one to question religious control and be open to an awesome creator.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I love this show and was definitely glad that I found it here for cheaper than what it would have cost me at other places!
1455160474|5.0|If you think we don't have enough freedom in this country, you have only to listen to this account. It will increase your appreciation of the USA and all that we have here.
1616550414|5.0|I love it, i has everything I wanted to know about Zelda, it's the ultimate book for a Zelda fan. I wanted the Collector's Edition one but it's extremely rare, but this one it's great by itself!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have enjoy the CD so much that when a friend heard it they too wanted one.<br />I hope that they come out with another CD with their great music
B00062PN6I|3.0|They don't have much of ear-exploding sound, but they are comfortable (if you know how to fit them). For 10 dlls it's a bargain, but could get better headphones for a little more money.
B009X2CVXA|5.0|this is the second Kate Morton book I have read and once again she captures the reader with believable content that unfold unexpectedly up to the end. wonderful!
B007NESBK2|5.0|Sade: Bring Me Home -Live 2011 (Blu-ray)<br />My Husband and I went to this concert. It was by far the best concert we ever went to! This DVD is amazing. It was just like being there all over again. You will love the special effects, and the awesome band! Watching Sade and listening to her gives us goosebumps. Like my husband said, &#34;Nobody should be that COOL!!&#34;
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Well let me start off by saying that I just got into playing the original Temple Run when this one was released. I enjoyed the original so much that I decided to try this one. I was hoping for improvements over TR1 and they definitely did that. Great gameplay, great graphics, great sound, etc. All in all I love it and can honestly say that I am addicted to it. Definitely recommend this!
B00005O5CM|5.0|Glad I was able to find this movie on Amazon.  My daughter was so upset when her first copy got destroyed.  This is one of her favorite movies and she is only 4 years old!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  Beautifully written with suspense on nearly every page.  I cannot wait for the third book in the trilogy.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|Nice CD at an even better price!  Arrived quickly and I enjoy listening to it while driving back and forth to work!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The first Ken Follett book I have read and it certainly won't be the last.  I could not put it down and could not wait to read the second book in the trilogy.  Ken Follett is a brilliant writer who researches his subject completely.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I never thought you guys would make a Temple Run TWO. I loved Temple Run one and I love this one too. I recommend this for everybody.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I have over a dozen 3D titles in our home theater now, but Avatar gives, still, by far the best 3D experience.  Can't go wrong with this one!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was very well written with twists I wasn't expecting at all. The ending was too abrupt however, and left me wondering whether Jacob really was guilty. With that being said, this book will haunt me for a long time.
B006O6FK2W|3.0|My grandson seemed to like this on the day he received it, but I have not seen him play with it or mention it since.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Great movie for music lovers or anyone up for a good laugh!! and definitely not just a chick flick! I have watched this movie 6 times since receiving it!!<br />Fast delivery also which was appreciated!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Surprised at how easy it was to get into this. The show starts well and gets you hooked straight away.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Really leaves the reader intrigued about the ending of the series. Very intense story that moves at a quick pace
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele just have a nice voice. The CD was a present and obviously hearing the songs i was really blown away......!!
B0081336FO|5.0|This has been a pleasant surprise--a well done, up to date Sherlock Holmes.  Unique twists to old stories.  ////i'm really looking forward to Season 3.  The only problem with these shows is that the PAL british format causes the video to look jerky.<br /><br />yt
1451695195|5.0|This book was a terrific read and its source is so reliable no one can refute the existence of an afterlife. The afterlife will be glorious.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I really like the old school games so as you can guess I was pleased to see and play this game. Tons of fun for everyone.
B007I1QUYE|4.0|I had one dvd of the first spiderman it was time to buy the rest blue ray is the way to go.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|I wanted something not too bulky to hold a new Canon t4i with a 18-55mm lens. This fits the bill so I can protect it when moving locations or changing scene angles when filming. And case logic makes a quality product. Good fitment and pockets to store batteries, cables, and lens caps.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|I'm telling you as a movie fan this might be the best film to be released all year,and it's still early 2013. Everything about this film is truly badass, but one thing. Please come back Mark Hamill The Joker needs you, the guy doing his voice in this film is not as twisted as his character is, he sounds like a very proper acting homosexual, and to me really takes away from his crazy killing ways in this film. John Dimaggio did a great job in Under the Redhood, should of at least got him back. Anyway enough of that this movie is still a 10 out of 10 really amazing check it out. Beats the crap out of any live-action Batman movie.
B0055OG2BC|5.0|So glad to find this on Blu-ray. Lot of great actors in this Bond spoof. It doesn't get enough attention.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|My Review: OMG! This movie was full of action from start to finish... and it was in 3-D, which made it even better as the graphics were outstanding-definitely getting your attention.<br />I Love the paranormal spin on this classic tale, Famke Janssen (Jean Grey-X-men) was amazing as the main witch and evil as Hell itself too. Her performance was awesome.. Jeremy Renner as Hansel YUM (Hawkeye-The Avengers) Oh my he made an excellent Hansel... bringing the brain and the bronze together. Gemma Arterton as Gretel (Tamina-The Price of Persia) was spectacular, bringing grace and beauty.<br />I absolutely Loved and Enjoyed this movie.. will definitely be purchasing the DVD...<br /><br />Imdb Link: [...]
B008FPIPR2|4.0|The writer of this movie certainly has a very good imagination. I enjoyed the movie, but it's probably not one I'd see again and again. Julia Roberts was very good in this movie. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy and fairy tales and anyone who just wants to relax for an evening of no thinking required entertainment.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This is a fun game but, when I downloaded it it was free until you play so long then the game wants you to buy stuff. Why can't game makers just set up one set price and be done with it. Other wise I would have rate the game 5 stars.
B005OK721G|5.0|I bought this movie because I had been wanting to see it<br />I thought this was a great movie, I was not diappointed<br />I would recommend this purchase if you like action movies.
B000TERDJS|2.0|I'm a Brian Eno fan and was drawn to this album for the glowing reviews but I found it to be very repetitious. It's almost as if you're paying for a single, not an album. Do yourself a favor and buy his Apollo CD instead, which is a far more interesting and moving piece.
B005PTYP70|5.0|I bought this as a gift for someone and it came really fast<br />This is a great movie and I bought it to complete a collection<br />If you like Tom Cruise I would recommed this movie becasue it is Tom at his best.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Yes sir this is the real deal in the Dark Knight series for sure go get this as fast as you can and sit back and enjoy
B004ADF7RO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movie of all times. always a good pick me up when nothing else good is on TV.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game with a few gliches.  I don't believe I would have downloaded the game if the only way you acquire reasonable amounts of necessary gems was to purchase them.  Also when I first started the game there were no ad interuptions, now you can't get thru one screne without them popping up.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Wish there were more episodes. Can't wait till they come out with more from this series. Must watch Sherlock Holmes!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I wish there were more holidays each year, I look forward to each and every update in this imaginative version of a popular game
B0055SWM08|5.0|we love this game. its a good break from angry birds<br />blab blab blab blab words words words about stuff
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|How can you possible berate what has become a classic cult-like game?  You can't, and getting it free is a bonus.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I grabbed this as the free app of the day - so happy I did! Stayed in a hotel with a very unhappy baby above and this helped immensely.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|You better brush up on your trigonometry in this one;.  Calculating angles and gravitational fiels make this game challenging, the graphics and storyline are entertaining
B007HACDLK|5.0|like all of Vince Flinn books that I have read Mitch Rapp does his job on the bad guys. know my wife is also reading Vince's books.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|How cool is this!!  Combining every nerds 2 favs, Star Wars and gaming!!!  It's fun, tough, and entertaining all at the same time
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|Came in reasonable time, were clean and just what I ordered.  Thanks  Will order again.  have enjoyed them I am retired and only doing for past time
B000H4TX9I|4.0|well done series. It has a plot that carries thru throughout the series.I look for more shows like this one
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What can I say about this addictive game but have fun, its not easy to put down. I recommend this game for game lovers and the sister game Flow Free:Bridges
B004MC0FO8|5.0|great way to get music you dont know the names to. love using this app, have it on my phone, and kindle
B004UID2LC|1.0|I had you tube on my Kindle Fire when I first got it, don't know what happen to it but I don't like this version
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game! If you love horses, you will too!!! You take care and play with horses, it's really fun! There'd games and stuff to do. I love it!
B004GYY714|5.0|This app plays all my local stations crystal clear.  Within 30 seconds of downloading this, I was listening to car talk.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is amazing I haven't stopped reading it! I think I've read it at least 20 times! It really pulls on your heart strings.
B004D20JP2|4.0|Overall it's a great classic, just remember like so many olde tales don't let the kids watch it alone! Definitely a lesson or two to be discussed after the show.  My kids complained a couple of times that there is no speaking, but they sat watching very very closely the whole time.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|2012R: Just plain sucks. Guess I just don't get it. Tall building, Dredd ... blah ... blah ... blah. Even Stalone was better, and that wasn't great. MFJLabs 2x
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another great novel from Tom Clancey and his cast of characters. Started a little slow and took awhile to see where the plot was going - but once it came together was great.
B0088TG252|4.0|2012R: You gotta stay with this one to understand what's going on, but other than that it's good. A little pessimistic regarding the government, but that's not new! MFJLabs 3.5x
B00004W4UB|5.0|Though this movie is different from the book, I am not sorry I bought it. Julia Roberts and John Malkovich were totally believable in their roles. I have watched this a lot since I purchased it. SCORE!
0307592731|5.0|Great read.  Very captivating!  Our entire book club loved it. Would have like to see some photographs.in the book but found them on her website.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My daughter told me about Downton Abbey and said we should try it out, and we are hooked! Dont even miss our Dish!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was another masterpiece by Stephen King.  It is definitely not a horror story, but a love story instead.  And no, it doesn't end like you would hope, but you'll have to read it to find out for yourself.  I couldn't put it down!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Enjoy bingo app. Download this app and play hours of bingo. I have it on my cell phone also. Its great
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I didn't have the chance to watch Downton Abbey when it aired on PBS (I don't actually get any TV channels at my house), so I took the opportunity to watch Seasons 1 and 2 on Amazon.  I enjoyed (almost) every single minute.  The Crawleys and their staff feel like my friends.  Watch them, you'll be glad you did!
B0002ONAM4|5.0|If you want to fill out your rock collection with relevant and timeless classics, this album is a must for obvious reasons. If you're not worried about having first issue or limited issue releases and just want the vinyl sound, no worries here.<br />A lot of times you get sub par reworked mixes and or masters that never should have seen the light of day but not here, at least not to my ears.<br />But if you want the collectables then well, buy that.<br />For me thats not always top priority.<br />[...]
B009JZTP4Y|5.0|Love this move however I would really like it if you could put Harvey and Victor Victoria on free streaming with my yearly subscription. Thanks,<br />George
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Michael Connelly always has an interesting story line. It keeps you interested and guessing as to what will happen next.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I don't like \\"reboots\\" or \\"re-imaginings\\" especially with my beloved Star Trek. But, I loved it!! And I was much more accepting of the film since there's a twist that kind of explains why things are different. Great cast-beautiful effects!
B00000251N|5.0|Sometime I just like to listen to soft music and Neil Diamond does a wonderful job with all of his CD's.  I Love Johathan Livingston Seaguil CD.
B009ANP4F4|4.0|Great dancing in this movie.  The plot and some of the lines were rehashes, but the talent of the dancers were amazing.  The choregraphy was excellent in a modern setting.  Not your '40's dance movie.
B000P0J09M|5.0|Long time I wanted to have this product and now I got it<br /><br />Good to do business with U.<br /><br />Thank U
B008458O3S|5.0|Great problem-solving game! I use with my elementary students. They ask for it whenever they earn a game time. I enjoy it,  too!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I chose to give it 5 out of 5 because it is a great product<br /><br />I recommend every body to watch this movie<br /><br />Thank U
B005PK553C|5.0|I never knew about this show until I started watching Season 2 - American Horror Story: Asylum. I absolutely love that each season is a complete story - start to finish - and that most of the main actors return each season. I will say, I'm usually stunned that this is on TV, and I'm pretty sure I've given myself some kind of permanent brain damage by taking it all in; but I'm hooked! It shakes me to my core and sticks with me for weeks. I cannot wait for season 3.
B000C20VRS|5.0|I loved the product thank U<br /><br />It is a kind of movie that every body wanted to watch<br /><br />Thank U
1449305172|5.0|I really like this book (and the accompanying website, leancanvas.com).  If The Lean Startup is the book on lean startup principles, this is the handbook where the rubber meets the road.
0345803493|5.0|Oh my goodness this is a very good book love it. It's worth the money, get it enjoy. thanks alot
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It's action is slower coming than it's predecessor but I found it's momentum sufficient. I'd like to remind those who criticize this book for its \\" whiny teen\\" issues as to which section this book tends to be found in at the bookstores. For it's intended audience, and for some of us who still enjoy a youthful imagination, this book is worth the read.
0345803507|5.0|The book Fifty Shades Freed is a very good book, you really need to read the triology of all of them.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|I must say I didn't really know what I had bought, it was a recommendation from a friend but I absolutely loved this book. The author combines story telling with some sports science and human history woven together to create a fulfilling book that gives you plenty to think about and consider.<br /><br />Thumbs up from me!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Not funny at all! Probably one of the worst movies I saw in 2012. The streaming quality was not good either.
0880298855|5.0|This is quite an entertaining and enlightening book of the Strand stories and illustrations. Very glad to have received it. A+++
B008MM9630|3.0|cannot figure out the magic word stuff and it doesn't give you a network to ask for friends if you just have a few friends who don't do games. what goes into the box when you want to cast a spell. Also, it would be helpful if you coudntap on items and ingrediants and it would tell you how to get them. Are there any helps or hints anywhere? Other than that I think the game is fun.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I love this game on my kindle android.  I can play this anywhere and it keeps me occupied when I have to wait for appointments. It was easy to load and is fun to play.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Remembering my childhood board game Yahtzee........this is the perfect game that is quick to play and involves some strategy. Recommend highly.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|should read the books in order so  you don't lose the main story.  great mystery with great romance scenes that make you blush but not vomit
B000EMGAOY|5.0|The songs on this cd are the kind that get stuck in your head and won't come out until you listen to them over and over, luckily, they're good.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|You don't find shows like this on TV anymore. It is nice to see the world as it would have been had we lived a simpler time. Great story about family ties and caring for those we love.
B002NXSRW0|5.0|My friend is obsessed with G.I. Joe and had to have this movie, I haven't seen it but my friend loves it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I don't like watching TV but I have been watching this non stop since a friend told us about it.
0451526384|5.0|I bought this book the day my boyfriend, a sailor, shipped out for an 8 month deployment.  It really helps put things into perspective.
B0001I561E|3.0|The product said like new, well the case looked really new, but the disc was all scratched up. On a plus side, it worked so I can't complain too much.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|I love Maroon 5 and two weeks after this cd was released I went to the concert and had a blast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i cant tell u how addicted i am of this game ues i can it flipping rocs!! i have to tell
B000669GAI|5.0|Pearl Jam was a major part of the grunge music scene for me growing up and it helped that my mother and I could bond and rock out in the car to all sorts of music.
0307352145|4.0|This was a good read. It had some great insight to how the world views quit people. Gave me lots to think about when raising a quiet child!
B00005QENZ|5.0|I have everything Aerosmith has ever made and this cd was purchased to help a friend complete his collection, lol.
B003CBVU30|5.0|You can never go wrong with a well thought out SNL skit turning into a full length movie...well except for maybe Wayne's World 2.  Fun movie to waste an afternoon to.
B000IOM1RI|3.0|I honestly do not know if this cd is good or not or even what it sounds like since I bought it as a gift.
B0027I93U6|5.0|Got this for my fiancee for Christmas, and we spend the entire day watching it.  The next day we subscribed to Showtime and have fully caught up and are absolutely addicted to the show.  Love Dexter!
B007V508CC|5.0|I love Maroon 5, this album did not disappoint.  It has many fun songs and Adam Levine has such a seductive voice that can make me listen to it for hours.
1449320104|5.0|I am a big fan of the Albaharis' \\"Pocket reference\\" and \\"Nutshell\\" books on C#. If you are thinking whether to go with the latest edition, or to save $10 and buy the older (4.0) one, p. 6 says that \\"C# 5.0's big new feature is support for asynchronous functions via two new keywords, async and await\\" and indeed, if one compares table-of-contents items across the editions, then, as far as I can tell, with the exception of a few one-page additions (Caller Info Attributes, TCP in Windows Runtime, BlockingCollection&lt;T>) and one deletion (The Zip Operator), changes are confined to the two chapters on threading. (I will add the ToC excerpts in \\"Comments\\"). Decide accordingly.
0375826726|3.0|My ex husband was really into this series and because of that I just couldn't stand the thought of reading it, even now.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|All cool, I am lazy to write more about this, but it looks like you need some of my time so I will just say, I love you all :)
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I read all the books and this was by far much better than previous movies in the franchise, especially #4.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|All cool, I am lazy to write more about this, but it looks like you need some of my time so I will just say, I love you all :)
B0000AQVCL|3.0|I didn't really like the whole cd, just a few select songs, luckily the cd was cheap in the first place.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|All cool, I am lazy to write more about this, but it looks like you need some of my time so I will just say, I love you all :)
B00447L4JG|5.0|I love Halloween and I love Christmas so a movie that combines them as well as this captures my attention.
B00991TCOG|5.0|All cool, I am lazy to write more about this, but it looks like you need some of my time so I will just say, I love you all :)
076115728X|5.0|teaches kids that it's okay to make mistakes.  Love that it's interactive and a lot of fun.  My kids love looking at this book!!!
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The descriptions throughout were lovely, but I thought it ended rather abruptly and with little explanation of their new physical plane.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have only read this book and the last song by Nicholas Sparks and I have to say they are some of the best books I have ever read. Going into reading this book I didn't think it would be very good but I was wrong. It definitely deserves the five stars I've given it. The love Katie,Alex,Kristen,Josh, and Carly all share for each other is remarkable. A great book
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Timely portrayal of teenager facing awareness of family sexual abuse. Good young adult pick despite some explicit sexual content.  Above average.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Am part of the living looking out for the dead! We love Carl and Glen...<br />Can't believe Darryl split with Merle............
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This story is quite exceptional. It's heart-breaking and heart-warming(real life heartbreaking). The writing was excellent, although some of the vocabulary was over my head (sad to admit but true), this book made me cry and it made me laugh. I loved the wit between Hazel and Gus, quite smart for their age. Gus showed true courage and I really appreciated the way he handled the crappy things that life handed him. This is definitely an encouraging book and a must read!
B000PC6Z48|4.0|We loved the movie.  However, the sequel after the movie &#34;stuck&#34; so had to turn off.  We have not viewed all the other movies yet. Thanks.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Though perhaps less full of quick wit than P&P, Persuasion is a better, more refined book. Anne is a less indulged Lizzie. Having never been her father's favorite she has learned a subtler, more patient way of living. A better role model, though more difficult to follow, her joys are  truer for having been harder won.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|All genres, and this app covers it. I will probably upgrade to the paid version, but the commercials are not all that obtruvise. Nice app, easy to use. Good stuff.
B009LXEBD4|3.0|This cd I purchased is pretty darn good. I certainly do enjoy her music and would recommend it to all who ask
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was great fun, and has a great hint system. It gives enough hints to move the story along. Pretty creepy at times, the atmosphere of the game is so impressive. Can't wait to try part 2.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved this story - different and kind of Sci fi - right up my alley.  Really enjoyed this story and it makes you re-evaluate the time line of our lives.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Classic Steven Spielberg here! (And Peter Jackson as well!)<br /><br />My son and I really enjoyed watching this film; reminded me a bit of the &#34;Raiders of the Lost Ark&#34; in that it feels like a modern interpretation of the old film serials of the 30s and 40s.<br /><br />The animation and attention to detail are amazing.  Lots of action, intrigue, and hidden treasure - more than enough to inspire the imagination of young adventurers everywhere!  This one is a new classic for our family...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game so addicting cant stop PLAYING it is really fun. My son loves this game and wont stop playing.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A lot of people think u don't need to learn how to love but I disagree and the divorce rate in the country proves it
B004W1GCQO|4.0|Very engrossing! It's a shame Amazon sucks you in for a free season 1 ( Prime Membership ) then charges for Season 2.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a very interesting book that was about family, friends and how life can change in an instant. The story captured your attention from the beginning and did not disappoint through the last page.
B00B2DGYQS|5.0|Purchased this through amazon.uk.com.  Couldn't wait for the U.S release date. So Yossi has grown up. No spoilers. There where parts that I questioned about the actor playing Yossi's decisions in behavioral responses. None the less, this movie moves really quickly and at one point I was wondering how they were going to fit in the new character. Great job allowing us to follow up.  The extras are just as good, there are facts about homosexuality in films in Isreal that I didn't know, with regards to the original movie. Well worth the purchase.  Only wish it came out on blu ray. That fact really pisses me off....why not release this on blu ray?
0765342294|5.0|It wasn't the best book I've ever read, but it was a great book. It had captivating stories, good format, and kept me flipping pages the entire time. Very hard to put down.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Incredible, historically accurate story of true friendship and of overcoming a challenge. A great insight into the lives of two great men: A king and a speech teacher with questionable credentials but great skills.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|At first it was fun and good but the I spent money and the next time I tried to play it wouldn't so I don't recommend this app if you want to buy stuff
B006LSZECO|1.0|I believe this book is the worst I have ever read, the ending really was the sprinkles on top of stupidity.  The plot is completely preposterous, ridiculous, absolutely not plausible.  I am absolutely flabbergasted as to why this book has gotten any good reviews unless they are all friends of the author.  Unbelievable, baffling and just silly.  Please spare yourself the suffering.  Your time is worth more than reading this book.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I loved the way this story was told, true to the spirit of the events, but also exciting and humorous.  Bonus, my 12 year old son watched it, loved it, and learned something about our history.
1401216676|5.0|I feel like most comics about the Joker just portray him as a man thrust into pure hysteria, doing what ever he can to show the \\"joke\\" behind crime. This was the first time I felt like I got to know the Joker a little bit better. Everything he does in this book is to prove one point, that he's not so different from the normal person, and that his insanity isn't just some blind rage. I have always loved the Joker, and for anyone else who does this is a must read. I've read it 15 times already and I feel it gets better with each read.
B004ULNJIU|5.0|the movie arrived on time and worked great. no issues. the storyline was interesting and kept me watching for what happened next.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|This was an O.K. book but got boring at certain parts.  Still unsure who pulled the trigger. Wanted Emily's Mother to admit to what she did with the diary.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Easy read from beginning to end. Kept you engaged. Looking forward to reading the next book and finishing the series.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The plot of The Racketeer  seems rather warmed over from previous books with money being wried around the Caribbean.  Getting there was different.
B009F879HK|3.0|Yes, great song, good sounding attempt to create a reproduction of the original & for most the original being far out of our grasp in value. The only reason for this record to exist though is for hard core collectors. Of course the price will skyrocket as soon as inventories are gone. It's amazing how for people will go to wring yet another cent out of this. It's well done but when all is said it's just a reproduction.
B008HT4FUW|4.0|Quality of image and production is superb. Characters are interesting and story is gripping... I have just started to watch the show, and can't wait for more...
B0067LXQAW|4.0|Have seen them live and have all of their previous releases. I did think this was one of the more weaker. Maybe its the fact we had to wait so long.
1616550414|5.0|Recently bought it and loved it so much that I ordered a copy to give to my brother for his birthday when it comes up.
0307949508|5.0|Man, read all three within three weeks. Missing them now! This trilogy has you on the edge all the time.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|It was very heartwarming at times and tragic at other times. It was sad and happy ,and very funny I think that it was a well written book
0307454568|5.0|Unbelievable twists and turns. I have not enjoyed reading this much in a very long time! I need to find something else to carry on!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This was a gift for my husband--he loved it. In fact, he is a real Bourne fan.  Were not sure if we would like Jeremy Renner in this role, but did very much.
B000002H4C|5.0|Its a classic with fantastic sound track and at the time animation was out of this world, (no pun intended)<br />This is the classic
B003D0ZNWY|5.0|I bought this compiled collection of the complete works of Mahler, because I have wanted to learn (sing) some of his songs, and Mahler has written a number of songs.  I find the selection of orchestras and singers to be first class. His songs are original and beautiful creations..  Mahler often used special melodies and unexpected intervals.  I recommend this collection.<br />It was also VERY reasonably priced for being such a large collection (16 CD's)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|my daughter read these in school and i wanted to try them.. wow, its well worth the money and time.. you will laugh, cry and even get angry.  I put myself in the parents place,, we would have had a revolt in the first 1/4 of the book
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez' story is amazing - like a fairy tale come true.  I gave his CD's to my daughter so I didn't listen to any of the songs but<br />the whole of South Africa loved each and every one of them, so I'm sure I would love them too...I did hear many of the songs in the movie and the lyrics are quite original.
0307352153|3.0|Susan Cain's book, \\"Quiet,\\"caught my eye...because...Shhhhh\\"...I'm an introvert.  It seems that I have recently been hearing more about introverts and gladly gravitate toward any information that would help me find out more about this personality type that is often overshadowed by those of the extrovert variety.  The revelation that I am not \\"crazy\\" because I do not like to go to lots of parties and would sometimes rather stay home then be social, was like a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Filled with many supporting statistics and stories of introverted individuals, this book helps introverts (and those who love them) see introversion as an asset and not a liability.  The book itself, for me was a slightly difficult read because of the text-book like features of certain portions of it.  I found the stories easier to follow because I relate more relationally (people oriented) than to facts.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to those who are academically inclined.  It could be a great book to study for a class.  I give this book 3/5 stars.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Im glad Joffreys dead.Terrific read,and it keeps you so interested that you dont know if you want it to have an ending or to just keep going and going. How long before the next installment.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I liked this book because it had a lot  of detail . I think if I were Susan , Edmund or Peter I would<br />believe Lucy about the wardrobe and Narnia. I would recommend this book to Avery and Sim
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|I really enjoy this game! It is fascinating to play, it is very well produced, and has a very cool &#34;story&#34;. It's based in H.P. Lovecrafts Cthulu universe. The only thing is that I wish it were easier to figure out how to play. The videos do not work on my gen1 kindle fire. So it may take a little trial and error to figure out how this implementation works.

B0060MYK7G|5.0|I like the history, murder, double dealing, sex.  I have read many books on the Borgias and the plot goes along with the fiction and the histories.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My daughter talked us into watching this one, and it was very sweet.  Most enjoyable were the acapella performances of very catchy songs that I had to sing along with, much to my daughter's annoyance.  It was great.
B0034G4OY0|5.0|A very sincere and touching film from actor/director/producer Clint Eastwood. Matt Damon as always is a very talented performer, the rest of the cast is also great developing each of their characters. We saw this film at the movies expecting little, what we got was amongst many elements, a very honest story that points out an interesting, honest and simple approach on how we may perceive life and death.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander obviously had a life changing experience that’s supported by his credentials and knowledge. Well written and easy to read.  I have recommended to several people and will continue to do so.

B007Q0OUKS|5.0|I bought this for my Nephew that is 8 years old. He has been playing with Legos since he was really little. As of a few years ago he actually started looking at the books and really started putting them together. He is very good at them so I wanted to find him something from Lego that might take him a little longer to put together. It was a really nice set

B001OGWY1W|5.0|This is either the best or the worst based on who you talked to.  I still think it raises the bar from the first film.  This is not the Joker we grew up watching or reading in the Comic books.  The Joker is more about creating chaos with growing skill.  This Joker sees his match in Batman and refuses to destroy him.  Instead The Joker tortures Batman with impossible choices and taunts that raise the stakes.<br /><br />Heath Ledger gives a Oscar worthy performance.  Some people hated the entire film.  I had long conversations and a few debates.  Because the price has dropped, it was an easy choice to purchase.  Having watched it again, it's very complex film with many elements and layers.  It is a film that can reveal more as you watch it again. I came away thinking this is the best of the three films.  I plan to see The Dark Knight Rises again with the first 2 films  fresh in my mind.<br /><br />So bottom line, I think it's a great film.  The price is perfect for anyone who wants it in their collection.  Make your own decision about what you think of this film.  Share it here. I recommend it.
B004GYY714|5.0|this has a lot broader choices of local radio stations over other radio apps  I have used. I use it at work since in our building it is hard to pick up radio stations on a regular radio.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|I purchase this for my niece.  I saw this in a Preview and really enjoyed it.  The best way to see ior buy it is to watch like a Glee episode.  Then you will get the style and comic elements that make this a fun movie.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I was really surprised by the quality of this watch. I have had it for over 5 months and it still looks good. Never really wore a watch before because my wrists are really skinny and watches just slipped around. I got this because the the face wasn't too large and I needed the date function. The strap is great and just the right size (i use the last hole) for my wrist. After 7-10 days mine will be three minutes fast, so it needs to be adjusted once a week. The speed can be tweaked if you open the watch up but I like giving it the attention one a week. Plus, the date needs to be set on the 1st if the previous month didn't have 31 days. The display Back is a nice conversation starter and the face is very scratch resistent. For way under a hundred bucks, you really can't go wrong...

B009RH973I|1.0|This looks like it's going to be a harder clamshell design to protect your Kindel.  Instead, the clamshell is on the back, and the front is a flimsy flap of who knows what.  I'm more worried about protecting the screen than the rigid back in most cases and immediately sent this back.  I found a great one, pink, leather, that was way less expensive and protects the entire device.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.

Unfortunately, the music haters don't always tell you who sings what, when or where to get it.  This make it easy to find the song, artist, etc, and also leads you oh, so easily, to Amazon to buy it.

006197806X|5.0|Originally Reviewed At: Mother/Gamer/Writer<br />Rating: 5 out of 5 Controllers, Crown Rating/Epic Read<br />Review Source: AUdiobook Purchase<br />Reviewer: Me<br /><br />haven't read Delirium - you just need to go do it right now. As in ASAP.<br /><br />*Slight Spoilers Below*<br /><br />Having lost the one person she has ever loved, Lena is now living in the Wilds and learning to survive as an outsider, someone who is infected with the horrible disease of love. She forges new relationships with members of the group (almost an entirely new cast of extraordinary characters), and learns a little bit more about herself with each passing day. But when her world is shaken by someone she's not supposed to care about, someone she's supposed to hate, Lena is forced to confront feelings she doesn't want to have or experience ever again.<br /><br />The best thing about this series is the character development, and in Pandemonium, we experience Lena's tremendous growth from book one to book two. How does one move on from a great and powerful loss? It's not easy, and I think Oliver captured the emotional tidal wave perfectly. As she learns everything anew, Lena begins to come into her own person through the alternating `Now' and `Then' chapters. She's stronger but not without fragility, wiser but not without doubt, and able to speak her mind and/or hold her tongue when necessary. Lena comes alive, birthed right off the pages by Oliver's compelling words. And her story - as you will soon find out by the end - is far from being over.<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for a series to go above and beyond expectations, then I highly recommend the Delirium Trilogy. Frankly, it has some one of the most well written cast of characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading. And Lena truly is a heroine who will remain timeless.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Long sometimes in language. However, still having the Ryans in the novels makes them worth reading. I can tell however, that the writing style has not been all Clancy. I thing he has some imput, but for the most part it is co-authored.
0061726834|5.0|Originally Reviewed At: Mother/Gamer/Writer<br />Rating: 5 out of 5 Controllers, Crown Rating/Epic Read<br />Review Source: Audiobook Purchase<br />Reviewer: Me<br /><br />Lo and behold, I have a new love and her name is Lauren Oliver. I adore books that step outside of the norm and create something so unique, so intriguing you can't help but fall in love with their mysterious nature. Delirium is a captivating tale of a young girls struggle to find herself in a society hell-bent on making everyone the same. Oliver presents an interesting take on what I believe most people take for granted, love.<br /><br />In the novel, we follow Lena as she prepares to be cured from the evil affliction that killed her mother. She is actually excited to be free of the disease and ready to move on with her life, a job, a family, stability. Something she's craved since her mother's death left an undesirable stigma on the family. That is until she meets Alex, a boy who challenges her way of thinking. It is in those simple stolen moments with Alex, Lena begins to understand herself, the struggles her mother faced, and why love is dangerous. Because it makes you feel, think, act irrational, uninhibited, unafraid and with the whole of your being. Love is everything, and once discovered, it can never be forgotten or undone.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed Delirium with my entire soul. Yes, you heard right. This book will clutch onto your heart and stain your entire being. It's magical, emotional, and delightful. Moreover, if you go the audiobook route as I did, you will be mesmerized by the amazing voice of the narrator who does a phenomenal job of capturing the urgency and pain in Delirium. If you missed this novel when it first came out, don't fret, there is still time to catch up with the series before book three, Requiem is released in March of this year.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan has once again captured my heart in his latest novel. Written with absolutely the best and up most brilliance, he has taken all his readers to a journey of heartbreak, excitement, worry, and mystery. I would suggest this piece of wonder to anyone and everyone looking for a great read to hook them in and hold them tight. I can only wonder what's in store for the next novel...
B007N8RULO|5.0|really like this game it can be played over and over with a new game each time. I would buy this one to keep on my kindle.

B00AE2LJVS|5.0|This movie of what it wa like to live during prohibition times keeps you on the edge of your seat. Shia LaBeouf, alomg with the other main actors are wonderful... Even had agood ending considering it is based on true events.  My husband and I truly emjoyed this.

B00821OX98|4.0|I am a bit sci-fi buff and love post-apocalyptic tales, so this was a natural for me. The characters are well-drawn and the relationships are important to the story -- again, features that appeal to me. There is a bit too much emphasis on battles for my taste, but I did watch every episode and await season three with every intention of viewing! So -- if you like your sf with family and relationship at the center, an engrossing story, good production values, and a strong cast -- this could be for you.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Nice game to meet old and new friends! This is where I go when I am in desperate need of quiet time.

B000ERU6QC|5.0|It's nice to know, in a time when bands like 'Mumford & Sons' are winning awards, there are still good rock bands out there rockin' blue collar. E of DM are high octane. NO SLOW S***! If you like that, buy this album (and their other two as well!).
0679746323|5.0|Not since the gossipy-hearsay-rumor plagued &#34;Tragedy and Hope&#34; has there been a book that challenges so many assumptions about 20th century Asian history.  The Amount of documentation is seriously impressive and presented in a very user-friendly way that doesn't detract from from the easy-reading style.  If you were ever curious about how Mao created his mystique and starved tens of millions of his own countrymen, you will find it here, in detail.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Really fun.  At times it's hard to get in the program.  Some people write out the word without drawing it.  Wish more people played it.

B004Z2TUGE|3.0|The plot is predictable but the acting is decent! Some of the special effects were interesting and their &#34;abilities&#34; continued to get better. It is obvious that they left the ending open for a sequel, but we'd rent that too!
B0081336FO|5.0|Simply outstanding...cant wait for Season 3 to come out...Hoping there are a few more stories in the next season...though chances of that are less...
0913866156|3.0|I have one of the smaller Thoth decks (a U.S. Games printing from 1986) that I purchased secondhand several years ago, and for some time I have been wanting the larger version so that I might get the full effect of the artwork of this amazing Tarot.  I finally purchased this edition from a local bookstore today, and I can hardly begin to express how disappointed I am with the quality of this deck! The card stock it is printed on is so flimsy that I don't dare attempt to shuffle the cards for fear of creasing them, and there is definitely something lacking in the vibrancy of the color reproduction. Worst of all, this deck only includes one of the three Magus cards, although the other two are in my older deck from the same publisher!<br /><br />Although I suppose I can still use these cards for meditation, as a functional deck for Tarot readings it is pretty much worthless.  I will now have to seek out the Swiss edition I have seen mentioned in other reviews.  Would that I had consulted here first before wasting my money!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Very seldom do I not finish a book, but this was one that I struggled to page 180 and then quit.  The problems with this book included disconnected story line, the author kept skipping from one character to the next, so you had a hard time keeping track of what was going on.  Her use of the F -word was ridiculous, throwing graphic descriptions of the teen boys fascination with porn, does not make the book an adult reading.  Many of the character names were so similar which made the reading confusing.  Additionally, the characters were ALL so negative that I ended up hating the book (there was not one redeeming character in the story). Finally, much of the writing seemed forced and some of the sentences seemed like she threw together a bunch of long words which, in the end, made no sense. I found myself rereading some sentences to try and figure out what she was trying to say.  JK needs to stick with children s' books and stay away from any adult writing.

A previous mission failed, so humanity's hopes are dependent on this mission being successful.  The closer the ship gets to the sun, however, the more perilous the assignment.<br /><br />Then strange things begin to happen.  And in a strange plot twist not even necessary to the tension and drama of this movie, the director and writer adds a weird and bizarre element the the plot. Fr me, that gums up an otherwise interesting and &#34;credible&#34; sci-fi action movie.<br /><br />I always wonder what happens in those back rooms that allow these types of production decisions to be made.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|I have a friend in the USA who is a great fan of Adele and when this was released, I got it for her to add to her collection. Adele is one of the top female singers at this time,even in the USA, and she sings this film score so very well. I have no hesitation in recommending this single.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|This was very nice in HD. Almost Blu-ray quality. No skips or pauses or sync issues. Can't wait for the rest of Season 7 to show!.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I am too old to believe in Zombies and things that go bump in the night. This TV series is however something else. If you put to one side the dead walking the streets eating the living and the gory method frequently used of disposing of said Zombies it is a cracking and extremely well acted programme with an excellent story line . Andrew Lincoln (a Brit actor) has a perfect Southern US accent and his fellow supporting actors all give of their best. It is an Armegeddon tale and the survival of the fittest but you can relate to all of the characters who are desperately trying to find a sanctuary. Well worth getting.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I read all the negative reviews and still I decided to give this app a try. It SUCKS!!!! It never worked on my phone. My phone would crash every time I tried to access it.  Finally I just uninstalled the app.

B003D81NVQ|5.0|Title says it all.  Best show on tv right now.  Better than anything else.  It reminds me of a dark underworld where bad things happen and it's up to the characters to fix it.  One land mine after another.  Oh yes, they make a ton of money, but there's always some setback.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show.  My daughter recommended it as she was watching it on prime and thought it was great.  I have caught up to current show and is my new favorite. Cast, setting and storyline are wonderful.  I highly recommend.
1592407889|5.0|I just finished reading this book; I could hardly stop reading to go to bed last night.<br /><br />Truth MATTERS, and for those of us who have known for years that Shirley MacLaine let her child live in Japan with \\"that man\\"....well, THAT is a strong statement in itself, that a mother would not be devastated at having her child so far away, and for so long.Most mothers MISS their children when they are separated for a SHORT time.<br /><br />I think Ms. Parker wrote very objectively of her mother, considering all. She gave her mother credit where credit was due: her mother bought her clothes every summer when Sachi went to visit her. Her mother drove to San Diego to \\"fetch\\" her daughter from what turned out to be a very bad being/man. This, to me, is NOT a \\"mean-sprited\\" book. Only  dumb and emotionally clueless beings could not \\"get\\" what the crux of this book IS. For Ms. MacLaine to have issued the statement she issued about this book...well... it is foolish for people  to believe her, when they have not KNOWN her, OR read this book. People who \\"side\\" with a *star*, without reading a book, are not trying to get to the truth; it's as if they think they will win favor with the star for \\"siding\\" with her!<br /><br />I wish I could think well of Ms. MacLaine, but I can't, now. I read 2-3 of her books, and I think she was honest about SOME things in those books, but now I think she left a heck of a lot OUT. I don't think she was ever really honest about why her daughter lived in Japan for years, while she had her career, and her love affairs.I don't think she has been honest with HERSELF! I don't think it is a hallmark of motherly love, that Ms MacLaine sent the kind of money she evidently sent to Mr Parker for years,for the REASON she sent it (!) with little of it being used for her daughter. And then , in light of that, for her to LEND her daughter/only child, a small amount  for an old used car, and demand and accept INTEREST for that loan, too. My God! I don't callthat \\"tough love;\\" I call it punishing a child who was essentially orphaned, and that is what I am saying, NOT what Ms Parker said.<br /><br />The shallow beings who are quick to throw stones at authors who write honestly about their lives, when the author has a celebrity parent, are NOT beings who care about truth,empathy, or other people. This book is not about \\"opportunism\\"...most authors make very,very little money from books. Former Presidents & 1st Ladies are paid millions up front, but NOT most other authors!Try \\"a dollar-fifty per hardcover\\", per what a speaker at B & N told a group I attended 5 yrs ago! To me, this is part of Sachi Parker's growth and healing process, and it almost requires readers who can relate to similar things with their own parents, to understand.I think that Ms. MacLaine has a lot of \\"work\\"on herself, that she has not done.  Ms. Parker has been doing the \\"work\\". This book is part of it. Blessings and compassion to Ms. Parker ---

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is the best one I have downloaded. I like the different reading plans.  you can also book mark and highlight verses.  for everyone that said you have to have wifi,  you can download a offline version under the settings gear. God Bless Us All!!!
B009439HEY|2.0|I will start by saying that I am a big fan of Steve's output in any genre he chooses to tackle.  Am also a longtime lover of the progressive era Genesis that this collection focuses on.  I just don't hear enough significant reinterpretation to justify this set.  On top of that, many of the lead vocalists either mimic Gabriel or actually sound quite off-putting.  The vocals are too \\"front and center\\" to allow appreciation of the instruments and in some cases, just bad.  Stick with the re-engineered/re-mixed Genesis releases - these are fantastic.  Wish they would release a high quality remix of Trespass, btw.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|This box set was a STEAL! Came with Blu-ray, DVD and digital copies! I had never used a digital copy so I was a little concerned. The instructions were simple and painless. I now have season one on my computer and my ipad with no problems! If you are a GoT fan, this is a MUST. And if you arent a GoT fan, you should really ask yourself why you arent!
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Sometimes the match making doesn't work properly but the rest of the game runs like a champ. The controls also need some fine tuning.
B001IF252M|5.0|When  I needed to add a second monitor to the iMac, I purchased this in addition to the Mini-DVI Adapter Cable. Very pleased!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed this Stephen King book. If you enjoy reading about JFK and a King book you will thus one.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is probably not the product for beginners. It has a place for your camera with one lens attached, but it also has 8 (I think) slots for additional lenses. So much storage space is great if you are a camera enthusiast, or if you are planning to get there, but for the casual user, it might be too much.<br /><br />Other than that, the quality is great and the camera fits perfect. Its just a little bigger than what we needed.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|i enjoy playing the different levels.<br />I don't have to be in a wifi area to play the game.<br />I would recommend this to other kindle owners.
B0010358CQ|5.0|OUTSTANDING animation, OUTSTANDING action, OUTSTANDING graphics with a very good story line. Who'd of thought John Woo had it in him.
0545265355|5.0|Great sale and had no problems what so ever and was happy with everything.  Arrived quickly and in great shape.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|What a serious continuation from the old Star Trek. This is the way you continue an era. The Spock in this is a dead ringer for the Spock of old. Fantastic choice!!! An a rare appearance from the old Spock had the people clapping if you saw it in the theatres. Hopefully this will go on for a long time.
B002BJGYTY|4.0|If you are a fan you will not be disappointed by these fast talking hip and successful women of different generations.
B009B8YZIK|3.0|This movie only gets 3 stars based on the amount of time it took for the real action began. For those who play the game, they know the action is immediate. I would like to see more movies like this of Halo but with more of what the actual game provides.
B0065IBZI2|2.0|Have been a Kate fan since I first heard her on the radio back in the seventies...and yes, she was on the radio here in the U.S. even back that far. She's come a long way since, and it's nice to hear her musings steering ever clear of those radio-play days. That said, sometimes longer pieces like these that dominate 50 Words can be accused of self-indulgence; in other words, not very interesting. The duet with Sir Elton John, \\"Snowed In at Wheeler Street\\" is a standout (I listened to this again as I was snowed in during the Blizzard of '13 [aka \\"Nemo]) but everything else suffers from being too long and unfocused.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Without a doubt the best true story I 've ever seen. Bruce Lee was trained by this man which also makes him truly great.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This hard to find movie was finally found used.  We greatly enjoyed watching this charming movie again and had no trouble at all with the previously watched DVD.
B002WCLG48|2.0|Disappointed in the way these were done. I expected more action in the catoons. Instead I got more of a history lesson. If you make any short stories or movies based on any video game especially one as popular as this, have it just like the game itself to keep ones interest.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was an awesome book!! I could hardly put it down!! Can't wait to start the next one and see how it ends.
B0001O3YD0|5.0|The movie that put Diesel on the map. The secind movie was good too but can't compare to this one. This had action and was scary. GREAT FLICK!!!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|As a beginner chess player I found this app to be great. I like how you can play against the computer or a real second player, plus being able to adjust the difficulty level helps me to really practice and learn on my level.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game because it is entertaining and addictive, but also challenging and mentally stimulating. Lot's of great puzzles.
B006C67NP6|2.0|The app itself seems like a great tool for musicians. However i purchased this with the intent of downloading content off their &#34;forum&#34; and had lots of trouble with it crashing my kindle. The app reccomends using google chrome or firefox browsers which are kindles competition hence the crashes. I would wait before getting this for kindle.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|This movie was a huge disappointment of the acting and role of Matthew McConahauy.  Tatum, was great acting along with some other actors, but overall it was not the greatest movie like I was hoping for.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya is my favorite.  Her music for me is better than Prosac, it's very calming.  I listen to it all the time.
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|This was a very heartwrenching story of a returned soldier who was reported dead, his family tries to move on and then he is found and returns.  He finds it impossible to become the fellow he once was,  This happens today with so many of our boys returning from the war and cannot cope.  A very powerful movie that every American should see.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|This is the best Christmas album ever.  Enya is my favorite of all time and this album is a crowning glory.
B002QRWJA4|3.0|After seeing the show on Broadway, you would expect to hear beautiful voices and in this movie I did not hear that.  The acting was excellent, however when Hollywood makes a movie out of a broadway musical they should turn to the real professional singers.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|My son (who is 8) liked how crazy the guy with the blue face was a and how the zombies were incorporated into the movie. The reason why he  thought it was 4 stars was because he didn't like the love part
0738711500|5.0|I have had many decks over the years but somehow could no longer locate my Rider Waite deck. While looking for a new one, I stumbled across this deck and book and have found that it is now my favorite deck of all.<br /><br />The artwork is stunning and the book is an easy to read and understand method to learning the cards.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|The meat of the book was well written but I don't like how the author ends her books.  It really leaves you hanging.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I loved this book. I laughed and cried. A really good writer, I have read serveral of her books and they are all great.
0316228532|5.0|J. K. Rowling uses her skill to delight adults in this English book about a vacancy on a local council.  It's interesting to see how things are done across the pond, and to compare it with local politics here in the USA.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.And what a suprized ending!!!Would love to read all of her books  and recommed them to anyone.
0316017930|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell does an excellent job of explaining how some people succeed while others don't.  A great book for every parent and teacher to read.
0374214913|1.0|I was excited for this book but now find myself sorely disappointed. The concept was great. However, it feels like it was written by a 12 year old boy who programmed a few lines of code once or twice and who drank too much Silicon Valley Kool Aid. This was very poorly written. In fact, I'm not sure I've read a book this bad in over a decade.
141659521X|5.0|I love all that Vince Flynn writes.  His approach to life in the world today makes one consider what the government might really be up to.  A great book-I can't wait for the next one to come out!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is so easy to use and it offer many options.  My favorite is that I can choose any song from my cloud player as my alarm.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|the games awesome I cant wait till the 2cnd 3thrd fourt and fith people who make this keep up the good work
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its hard but if its too hard then u should get bridges. yep get this app it is enjoyable yet classic
B003JTHXOK|5.0|An accurate  rendering of the confusion that comes with love that slips away to an abuse of the trust of a heart! Anyone who has felt this type of betrayal  and abandonment  ought to read this book, to help sort it all out.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Easy set-up, complete host of features for anti-virus - auto or manual. Complete anti-theft program that a newbie can set up.<br />you can go to a computer and  'see' where your phone is and turn on the siren and turn it off again..<br /><br />Try it ! &#34;Everything&#34; and more for your Smart phone  - free and easy.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|WHY DID THEY CANCEL SUCH AN AWESOME SHOW!!!! WHY?!?!?!!!  Think we should write Fox and ask what they were thinking?!!
B008GAXV3O|5.0|I never payed any attention to Leonard Cohen until the NATURAL BORN KILLERS soundtrack was released. The song &#34;THE FUTURE&#34; intrigued me but &#34;WAITING FOR A MIRACLE&#34; is a song that can put me where no one else can be. The vinyl sounds just fantastic on my SEEBURG DDS1's.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was right up there with the best of Nicholas Sparks, I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to see the movie, I hope they don't change too much!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is a fun engaging game worth every penny. I've almost played every level and they get more challenging without becoming frustrating.
B005PK56TA|4.0|American Horror Stories<br /><br />Interesting series.  Light entertainment. good for those interested in spooky shows and tongue in cheek.<br /><br />Relax and enjoy Jessica Lange
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I purchased this book after reading Gone Girl. This book is nowhere near as good. I quit reading half way through.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The book was good from a neurosurgeons standpoint and what a moving story. It did drag on at times but over all I would recommend it.
B00797MB0O|1.0|It wasn't very good. the \\"humor\\" they where trying to do failed horribly. Do not waste your time or money.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Another great lee child novel about jack reacher. Still haven't seen one shot and don't plan on it with shorty Tom cruise playing jack!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm addicted to this awesome show...Great quality, Great show , great season! Will definitely get season 3 when available !!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun and cool because you can name your horse and enter it in competitions and you get to take care of it and it's really cool!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Great Sci-Fi show that always keeps me intrigue and wondering what is next. I love how the writer uses real-life scientific research and theories to adapt them to the show.
1451695187|1.0|this person must have been stoned I would not refer it to anyone! This person claiming to be a Doctor!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great book, continues to advance the epic story. A lot of surprises, and a great read! Highly recommend to anyone who is interested in the series, and the HBO series as well.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Holds the Kindle securely without covering any part of the screen and I can read at many different angles.  I can just set it on my lap to read and it is very comfortable.  Has a nice look, too!  Much nicer than what I found in stores.  I highly recommend it.
B00138EZLI|5.0|I bought these songs for my Christmas gift this year. I listen daily via the Amazon Cloud. I have had the most amazing newness of spiritual guiding, they really touch my soul that has been so thirsty. Somebody Bigger Than You and I, helped me get my Gratitude back on!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have fallen in love with each of the characters in this story. They are each so very well developed that you feel like you really know each one. The story is complicated and sweet and amazingly relatable. Coming from a girl who has lived her own beautiful disaster it's wonderful to hear of one that can make it through all the trouble and come out on top! :-)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game, it helps me to pass the time at the doctors office. It also is also a good game for the kids.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was soooo good it is probably the best book I have ever read when I read the end of the book I freaked out I would 100% recommend this book to everyone I love it so much!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you child likes (loves) horses, this is  great app, my 8 year old daughter loves it. Seems to be pretty easy to move around on the screen. 5 star app.
B00122OTSE|5.0|Before he started getting all, uh, serious about things, Prince offered this great funk/rock masterpiece from '79 that sounded like nothing else at the time.  The title tune alone is worth the download price.  This is a great album.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|What a great book.  I've read a lot of his books and listened to others on CD as I drive on long trips,  so I knew that I was in for a great evening or two.Mr. Sparks didn't disappoint me.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Great price for the quality of mic.  I own two, and use them for conducting recorded interviews. They give a quality recording and do a good job cutting out background noise.  I sometimes get a light hiss during any periods of silence but nothing too noticable, and for the price I can hardly complain.  One small gripe - I wish there was a power light on the mic. Easy to forget to turn it on or off, and would be nice to have a warning for when the battery needs changing. Huge plus - I called customer service with a question and actually had someone from their corporate office call back and spend time talking me through the solution that worked for my very specific equipment set up. No offshore call center, not attitude that I wasnt important enough with such a small purchase. Totally committed and effective customer support. Kudos
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I have used this on my LG Spectrum 2, and so far so good.<br />I had to take my cell case off, and had to really push it into the mount, to wear it feels like it woulf break, but HAS not broken.<br />You just need to be gentle.<br />The tripod is good too.<br />*Great for my small business uses, family gatherings.  I don't imagine it would be useful for anything other than small screen cap filming.<br />Would buy it again.
B001LOPYHI|5.0|There is no comparison, if you like Sci-Fi, you must watch this movie!<br /><br />Sure, it's a bit cheesy with some props and actors, but it's not about the cheese, it's the fight for longer life!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I bought this book primarily as an easy read, and because the movie trailers had me interested.  Honestly, I had only moderate expectations for this book, as I just don't like overly sappy love stories.  This is NOT that kind of love story.  I found it clever and suspenseful.  I highly recommend it, and I'm sure it will be better than the movie (as the trailer has already shown variations from the book).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its easy to use.  you can buy horses and you earn diamonds by leveling up no cash spent out of your own pocket.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. Denzel Washington plays a tragic hero who is addicted to alcohol .The tension was real and well played.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Everyone in the family loved the DVD. It is very entertaining movie for all ages. The color is so vibrent and the animation is great.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|A well told story about determination and the difference 1 person can make.  My teenager and I both enjoyed it.
B00006AW2J|5.0|This album doesn't need my praise (or the notes of others here).  It is now held up as one of the greatest albums ever made, any genre, any time - sactified by critics everywhere.  Forget that stuff.  If you you want to know how the blues informed 50's rock and roll, crossed the pond and started the British Invasion and then came back and became something beyond anything anyone could ahve expected, it is all here.  Listen to \\"Street Fighting Man\\" - a pissed off proto punk anthem,  and then \\"Prodigal Son\\" - as real a blues mutation as can be imagined.  I know they wasted much of the last 30 years being stars.  But they once walked 10 feet off the ground. Listen in awe.
B007IK44CK|4.0|A great flick.  I would give it 4.5 stars... except I cant.  And 5 stars is for the best of the best.  This one just missed out.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I enjoyed this puzzle solving mystery. It kept me guessing and moving from place to place. My favorite was thing was that it gave you helpful hints and glues that put the piece of the puzzle together to help you solve.
B002UWH8P6|4.0|I was hunting for a new TV series to watch and landed on this. I found the narrative very captivating; I wanted to just continue watching the whole series in one sitting. The characters are diverse and provide depth to the story. Although the story is in an unrealistic setting, the interactions between the characters brings the story down to earth and makes it quite relateable.  Sometimes though, the depth  feels as if the story is moving too slow.<br /><br />If you're into Sci-Fi and looking for a show that will take your mind far away from your day to day activities, this is certainly a good show to watch. Don't be surprised if you get hooked.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|Too many details out of sync in this pic.  Space travelers using flame throwers as their weapon of choice.  Non-professionals chosen for a criticial mission...?<br /><br />Too little attention to detail will throw any sci-fi buff into questioning the consultants on this film.  Maybe they took a long lunch?!!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Good classic book. Enjoyed the time reading it and then seeing the movie. Take the time to read a book.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|While in the big, enormously competitive field of 2012 Best Picture nominees, &#34;Flight&#34; doesn't quite get there ~ Denzel Washington is riveting.  The story of the complex man who pilots a &#34;broken plane&#34; holds the viewer with its moral dilemmas.<br /><br />Watch it!
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I did enjoy this variety of Mahjong.  It may be the type others may enjoy but it just was not my cup of tea.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|Touching details offered by Mark O'Brien of his life make this story human and worthwhile.  His conversations with his priest, played by William H. Macy, are delightfully unpretentious.
B0085YNML2|3.0|This breaks up time to relax and have a little bit of fun. Relax and play a little. Have some fun.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app provides you with the ease of use of your touchscreen keyboard! When I got my Motorola Atrix 4G I quickly noticed how the touchscreen kept misinterpreting all my letters and numbers. With this app, it solved it by knowing how you type and what word you wanna say! This is even better than the auto correction tool usually found in Apple products. Thank you Swiftkey!!!
1423124960|4.0|My daughter loves this book. It includes all her favorite Princesses. She was very happy to receive this for Chistmas.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|This is a great movie and it was shipped in a very timely fashion.  It paralells the real Frankinstein from years ago.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book was really different and totally engrossing. I couldn't wait to see what would happen from page to page!  Getting the next one in the series right now and can't wait to start!
034580404X|5.0|I FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK I LOVE THE CHARACTERS AND IM SO EXCITED TO EVEN HAVE THE TRILOGY IF UR INTO THIS KIND OF BOOK THEN U WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|I loved this movie. It was inexpensive and very convenient since I didn't have to leave my home to rent it.
0670026603|5.0|This is a great book and I simply couldn't put it down once I started reading it. I love the characters, the story line, the witty conversations and the unbeatable British humor. The author is not trying for something big or ambitious, but there is something in this book that will touch your heart deeply and makes you do some serious thinking. And the love story is just so subtly presented without screaming loudly at the readers. Even though I secretly wished for a different ending and was very much sadden by it, I know this is the best ending and there simply wouldn't be any one better. This is a book that will stay with you for some time, a totally enjoyable read. I can already see this made into a movie!
B003MC5AV2|5.0|I wouldn't know but I think every girl goes through something like this but with a little help u can get over a heartbreak
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Excellent app for white noise. I recommend it as a sleep aid. Be sure to set up the alarm or duration settings before starting the sound.
B000K4X5XA|1.0|This dvd is from the 70's/80's..not what I was looking for or thinking it was. Can't believe they made this awful movie a blu-ray dvd!!
B00454U1NS|4.0|Has almost all of her best ones!  Missing one or two hits and of course a few new hits that i love.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this is the best you tube downloader out there.but just like all apps, you need to be smarter than the app. lol I've seen the negative reviews about this app,  But Ithink they are unfounded.  Again great app.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I don't usually give bad reviews, but this game just didn't work for me. when I would try to turn it would show a late reaction and I would lose, so I deleted it.
B00ANW33CM|3.0|I don't like that you can't see all the pieces. I wish that it was a regular mahjonh game. Thats what I think of it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was truly a great novel.  The strength and endurance that Pi had was remarkable!  Alone at sea for so much time and he still had the presence of mind to survive the ordeal and furthermore dream.  I believe that this is one of the best books I have read in quite a long time.  It kept me interested and looking forward to the next adventure.  And you ask, how could there be much adventure in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific?  You must read the book to find out!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Good read..I WOULD RECOMMEND THE BOOKS TO MY FRIENDS. I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH.I CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE LAST BOOK.
B00AKHWG6Y|5.0|Do you like Trans Siberian Orchestra?  Do you like prog rock and/or prog metal?  This supergroup of prog rock icons have made all the parts into something much greater then the sum.  This amazing album will take you on a Celtic journey.  I could fill this review with verbs like lush, layered, fantastic, etc....but no need.  One listen will hook you.<br /><br />The brainchild of Magenta keyboard player Rob Reed, the album's contributers include Steve Balsamo - vocals, Steve Hackett - nylon guitar, Gavin Harrison (Porcupine Tree) - drums, Nick Beggs (Steve Hackett Band) - stick bass, Troy Donockley (Nightwish) - Uilleann Pipes, whistles, Nick Barrett (Pendragon) - guitar, Neil Taylor (Tears For Fears) - guitar, Jakko Jackzyk (20th Century Skitzoid Band) - guitar, Francis Dunnery - guitar, John Mitchell (It Bites, Arena etc.) - guitar, Mel Collins (King Crimson, Camel) - saxophone, BJ Cole (Elton John, David Gilmour) - pedal steel guitar, Chris Fry (Magenta) - guitar and Christina Booth (Magenta) - backing vocals.  (I want to attribute the information in this paragraph to Northern England Art Rock Society (thenears) blogspot)<br /><br />This is an amazing album.  You need to give it a listen if you like ANY concept album, from Pink Floyd \\"Wall\\" and Genesis \\"Lamb Lies Down\\" to Queensryche's \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" to Savatage's \\"Dead Winter Dead\\" (which spawned TSO) to a new modern classic like Beyond the Bridge's \\"The Old Man and the Spirit\\".  Give this one a shot!
1435122968|5.0|This story, arranged chronologically, shows the beginning of Lovecraft's writing career when he wrote psychological Poe-esque horrors that only involved outside eldritch influences in a very vague sense. However, as you go through more of his works, you start to see him creating his own mythology and pantheon of Gods and aliens and see each story connect with each other through the sinister and familiar names you see in each one. The writing style is splendid, though anachronistic, and balances formality and vivid description and assures you that it is a human, not a narrator, shakily describing the unnameable horrors witnessed in the damned corners of New England.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This is another one that I won't be reading again.  Parts of it I really enjoyed but over all not so much.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I got the non blu ray one and it is fantastic I absolutely love it it is worth buying great quality for the non blu ray so I can't imagine how good it will be for the blu ray one so BUY IT IT'S GREAT.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This book was not an easy read.  A little slow and plodding but somehow enough to not give up on reading to the end.  The remembered events of the man's childhood were painful to read yet must be told.  All in all this was a testament  to life and how for some the road is torturous yet still filled with hope at last.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I liked the russian doll effect of these stories and many of them were fun to read - love the author's sense of humour. Not sure I 'got it' - apparently there is a 'puzzle' or something in this book. Well, I missed it. Completly. Do enlighten me somebody!
B005VPRET4|5.0|The friends series of Lego's are very good. My kid loves to build this.<br />It is a nice activity to keep kids and adults busy!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a classic sci-fi novel. One of my favorites for sure. - - - - - - -
0316017922|5.0|Very interesting ideas. I was so impressed that I bought three more copies to share with my adult children. It got me thinking, and geve me some new perspectives.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Loved playing this mystery role playing game,hated to stop playing it. Was so easy to get caught up in it! Had to Make myself STOP and get things done,(like cook,go to the store,etc)',I am 57yrs old and LOVE these games.I raised my children,cooked,cleaned,and by golly will enjoy my games.If you like mysteries,and whodoneits,get this game.
B003TNW044|4.0|DVD's came fast, nothing was wrong, and obviously Friends is amazing so it was fantastic.  I had no issues to speak of.
B0095P29EG|5.0|It was entertaining, fast paced and a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />Special effects were good.  Even a little romance.  Sould be enjoyed by the Sci-Fy enthusiasts.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|My only complaint is it does not recognize my voice when I tell it to call certain people. Easy fix though, I had to change their name to Brother Phil, instead of Phil, or sister Pam, etc... Other than that is been great. Easy set up and no problems since. Others can't tell I'm using it. I have only used it for calls.
B0094K1MH2|1.0|I could not even sit through the entire movie.  It as really slow.<br /><br />Maybe for a family that has nothing  better todo.
B008MM9630|5.0|Pretty fun so far. I just started playing but am enjoying and looking forward to what is to come. I love the music, which is important as you listen to it over and over. Not sure how to add neighbors yet.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|It was fast paced and very entertaining.<br /><br />x x x x x x x x x x x x x
B003VANOFY|4.0|Old model but decent.If kept on for too long, than your ears start to hit. Other than that, great product.
B007NZDES0|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST CONCERT VIDEO EVER. SADE IS PERFECT THE BAND IS AMAZING. EVERYONE LOOKS GREAT. THE PERFORMANCE IS EXCELLENT, THE LAST PERFORMANCE ON THE VIDEO IS THE GREATEST.

B001OSIV62|5.0|Fascinating story, hard to distinguish then from now in the making of the movie, but the experience of watching the film will encourage and delight.
B009B08LJ2|4.0|This was a fantastic portrayal of Batman. Worth watching --<br /><br />Now I want to address the Amazon Instant Video and Prime Video services regarding this movie:<br /><br />Amazon's Instant Video allows for the &#34;renting&#34; of the movie for a reasonably low cost and has no membership requirements-- you don't pay if you don't watch -- and it is great (they could do better with the cataloging process)<br /><br />The Prime Video Service does not always have the latest movies but for the price, the movie and tv selection is awsome -- you can't beat it at the $75 per YEAR price. And if you order things from amazon, chances are real good that you won't have to pay shipping -- the more you buy the more you save so you cant beat the value. I would recommend this to everyone.<br /><br />I just wish for a browser that call allow me to schedual shows to play systematicly rather than having to go down a list one at a time -- sometimes I would like to just veg out like the old tv days (I don't pay for the cable/sat services because I just don't think I like paying for commercials).

0425252868|5.0|A Higher Call, about a German fighter pilot who helped a badly damaged American B17 bomber out of German airspace during WWII, is a powerful and moving story about honor and chivalry in a bad war. The center piece is that encounter on December 20, 1943 high above Northern Germany when Franz, the Ace fighter pilot in his Messerschmitt does not shoot down the damaged bomber but does his best to guide the crew to safety, ending with saluting the captain.<br /><br />Over 40 years after the end of WWII, the two men, fighter pilot Franz Stigler and Bomber pilot Charlie Brown found each other again in an emotional meeting. I can't imagine anyone who can read without tears about the loving reunion of these former enemies. I certainly was overcome by powerful emotions, admiration for the two brave men, horror at the loss of so many good young people, and awe of the human spirit which, like Franz, can overcome the hostilities of war to answer a \\"higher call.\\"<br /><br />Adam Makos tells the story in a masterful way. There are lots of fascinating details about fighter planes and the pilots who steer them, about conditions in Germany at the end of the war. The book will engross historians of WWII as well as the general reader out for a moving and action packed story which shows the capacity of human beings to do the right thing under the most adverse conditions.<br />Gabrielle Robinson, Author of The Reluctant Nazi: Searching for my Grandfather
B007THA4FI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I can understand why some people may not like it, though.  There are a lot of characters and it takes some effort in the beginning to keep people straight.  And there certainly are no good guys and bad guys and maybe you won't be able to identify strongly with any single character.  But I thought these were the strengths of the book.  I love getting to know many different characters and different perspectives around the same events.  It's just like in an extended family where people are looking at the exact same events from vastly different perspectives.  But unlike in real life, you get a glimpse inside all the characters in this book.<br /><br />I also thought the ending was perfect.  No spoilers here.  I'll just say that she tied things up that needed tying and left other things to your imagination.  There was also a nice symmetry in the ending.<br /><br />I can't help but notice, by the way, that a lot of the books I love have this same even distribution of ratings--The Corrections and Freedom by Jonathan Franzen, Maine by J. Courtney Sullivan.  Just like the old perfume commercials I'll say that if like Jonathan Franzen, you'll loooove Casual Vacancy!<br /><br />I just finished reading this today but I know I'll be mulling these characters over for some time to come...
B004EPYZSK|4.0|Love the twist in this movie, Harrison Ford is great as the tyrannical father and Craig does a great job of looking confused through most of the movie.  Really wish they had shown Olivia Wilde's alien form though.  This is also a pretty good graphic novel
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was the best book I've ever read. It was so exciting and surprising. It certainly deserves 5 stars.  =)
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Interesting take on a classic series of tales, much under apprecitated, think this will gain a cult following.  Great costuming and special effects.

B003JTHWJQ|4.0|I really liked this eye-opening book but I'd rather prefer a little bit shorter one. I usually felt the examples given in the book were unnecessarily exhaustive but may be it's me since I was already into the idea.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|A wonderful fantastical romp through the 80's genre of B creature horror flicks. An awesome adventure in disposing of horrible creatures in creative ways.

B003JUGQ38|4.0|I have been a Dr. Who fan for many years, and am glad to see the series continue. The new series remains true to the original series with plenty of Daleks and metal men. Only gave four stars because some of the story lines are a bit contrived.

B007PJFIU6|5.0|This game may sound easy. Players judge cards based on a clue provided by the actively assigned player. The catch is that if everyone guesses your card, or nobody does, then you get no points. So when deciding your clue you must be both subtle without being vague. The game goes pretty quickly. So it is perfect for casual and party play.

B002SSUQFG|4.0|I collect watches.  I think the Seiko 5 is, for the money a good combination of quality and value.<br />First, it keep good time.  And it has a handsome face.  The hands glow well in the dark.  I'm not sure why Seiko put a transparent back on this watch because the movement is not finished elborately so that you would want to look at it.  Nevertheless, for a fraction of the cost of a cheap Swiss Automatic, I have a durable watch that works well for dy-to-day wear.  And it is the same military watch popular in the Viet Nam era and adds to my collection of military watches.
B004U8VX2M|2.0|I will not watch anymore of this series.... I am probably spoiled by Downton Abby as it is soooo great!
B0049VZ222|5.0|I started watching an episode by accident.  I originally thought it sounded like a gory show.  But after watching just half an episode I was hooked.  I realized the story was about the relationship of the people, not the monsters they were trying to avoid.  Great acting.  Likeable and hate-able characters.  I love a show that draws me in and makes me think about what I would do in the same situation.  This show stays with you long after your done watching.  Hope it continues to run for many years.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|As was the previous series, this was wonderfully written as to how change effected history. The cast was awesome! I love these series!
1455508977|3.0|I have read so much about Sparks' books and seen them on the bestsellers list for a long time and thought, 'OK, why not\\".  This wasn't a bad book, it was a good book.  Not great.  Thought it had more potentential.  BUT, it was a nice story and one I would let my pre-teen daughter read (very little swearing, even less sexual content).  I liked the main characters and just wanted .... more.<br /><br />I thought there would be more emotional tugs at my heart and they just weren't there.  It was a little bland and after 2/3 of the way through I just wanted it wrapped up and ended.  Wish the end hadn't felt so pat and flat.<br /><br />If someone asked,I'd say go ahead and read The Lucky One but personally, I had hoped for a little more depth of emotion.
B00932A3SK|5.0|Good story line. Slow sometimes but great. Just relax and follow the story.<br />It is in danish though but enjoyable
B009MF5BXK|5.0|If you loved the first one wait until you seen this one. It has great storyline nice cast nice gun fights and great martail arts choreography with a few laughs i recommend this to anyone who loves war & martial arts movies I give this rating a five because it has all the old action heros from the 80s and 90sandthey can still kick ass!!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I loved it, I would enlist tomorrow if CDF existed. All characters and story are well thought out and exciting!<br />Quick Read!

B0070Y46UY|3.0|Interesting story and imagery! The descriptive passage are amazing.<br />Some of the pacing is confusing, going back to the ship wreck.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I'm not much of a reader. In fact, I simply hate reading. A girlfriend told me she read this book and that I needed to read it by any means possible. I fought it off for weeks before finally giving in. Within the first few pages I was intensely intrigued. The books hooks you in right from the beginning and holds you there all the way to the end. I was actually sad when I finished it!<br /><br />The conflicts between Pigeon and Travis were not so overly absurd that they were unbelievable. They sure enough had their more than normal round of bouts, but each hiccup was actually an event which any struggling couple could endure at any given moment.<br /><br />The timeline of events were made more believable by being spread out over a few hours, a few days, even up to a few weeks. This made it a lot easier for me to engross myself with the characters emotions and allow the intensity of their feelings to come through. e.g. Thinking the love of your life hates you for 1 day is no match for thinking they hate you for 2 weeks.<br /><br />The amount of romance details in this story were perfect. It emphasized the emotional moments and the intense flutters that went with them, but didn't over describe each hand position or give a blueprint layout of each sexual action and/or position. They fool around for a page or two, then the next paragraph implies it's been an hour and they are happy. I greatly appreciated this, as it gave more concentration on the characters emotional bond and to the events unfolding, rather than the number of times they 'exhausted' themselves.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster really brought to the surface some of the underlying emotions so many women I know go through, especially one above all... struggling what they KNOW is good for them against what they WANT to be good for them.<br /><br />For someone who never liked reading, I finding myself uneasy while awaiting Walking Disaster to be released, just to see things from the other side!<br /><br />Above all, Jamie McGuire is one author I will now be searching for to have a good read!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was utterly amazing! I loved the plot! It was something new and different and it instantly grabbed my attetion and had me captivated throughout the entire book!
B005HG4C4C|3.0|Dream Theater in the past few years has been engaged in a perpetual game of Lights Out -  capitalizing on one strength, but to the complete and zero-sum exclusion of something else that formerly made their sound great.<br /><br />To start this review off on a petty and superficial note, I really dislike, if not hate, the name of this album.  \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\" ....? Is there anything poetic left in Petrucci?  Does the formerly poetic mind and (heart...?) of John Petrucci not rebel or flinch at the sound of this clumsy and heavy-handed title?  Also, again, superficial, but I want to go on record as saying that I also hate the album cover, for the first time in their career.  So far, two strikes for Portnoy being gone, but of course this is more on the business end of things.... let's get to the songs!<br /><br />Well... they weren't terrible!<br /><br />[1] On the backs of Angels:<br /><br />starts out with a pretty great guitar riff, if sounding a bit like James Young and Tommy Shaw in latter-days (way-latter days) Styx might have recorded for Cyclorama.  However, the song quickly turns into something fairly forgettable.  The synth lead \\"Pull Me Under\\" like intro wasn't really doing it for me, both because Dream Theater's been there and done that a number of times before, and also because the keyboard sound was a lot less moody and lot more blunt.  Getting into the song itself, it tried very hard to emulate Pull Me Under, and managed to do so in terms of song structure, if not melody.  James LaBrie sounded pretty rough on this track (and, on pretty much every track thereafter). Rudess's improved piano bridge in the middle was decent enough.  Petrucci's lyrics... well... while somewhat banal and forgettable, at least didn't distract from the song.  Whereas the last album, Black Clouds and Silver Linings, was a VERY strong musical offering by Dream Theater, the lyrics on that album were so bad as to make me to embarrassed to put it on in front of company.  Here, the lyrics... well... are words.  Nothing poetic, clever, special, emotional, thought provoking, or interesting... but, on the other hand, they didn't make me want to bury my head in a toilet, so there's that.<br /><br />Score: 6.7 / 10<br /><br />[2] Build Me Up, Break Me Down:<br /><br />This is a little bit fresher sounding musically.  However, the decision to revert back to the \\"distant\\" production style of Images and Words detracts from the sense of \\"currentness\\" the previous efforts have been able to shroud themselves in.  The lyrics are... well... a little worse than we might hear form Lady Gaga.  (clumsy messianic used in pop-star context). Plus, it's getting tiring the way that Petrucci's lyrics are more cerebra, dispassionate, and descriptive than emotional.  I wish he would try, oh, explaining how he feels, or failing that telling a story from a first person perspective... you know... things that tend to make music repeatable.  I can see Petrucii really wants to be Neil Peart and make clever and intellegent observations about the world, and to do so as unpoetically as possible.  He achieved in saying things unpoetically - as to making intelligent observations... not so much.  But again, the words aren't too distracting! Just not special.  The avenged Sevenfold sounding guitar solo in the middle was kind of good, though not overly fresh sounding.<br /><br />Also, now that we are on track two it is starting to dawn on me how emotionless and boring Mangini's drums are.  Now I've read that Petrucci made them on a drum machine and pretty much just had MM duplicate them.  I'm very much missing in the syncopation, creativity, and emotion poured into the drums by Portnoy.  The drums, while technically proficient, are really nothing but a human drum machine keeping everyone in time.  Not what any of us really want from Dream Theater.<br /><br />Score: 6.9 / 10<br /><br />Lost, Not Forgotten:<br /><br />Okay... here are those lame Petrucci lyrics I've been missing.  Man...just terrible.  What I'm supposed to take from pointless observations about some sort of warlord reflecting on how bad-ass he is... well, John... you aren't really doing LaBrie any favors here since he has to sing this dribble.  Duplicating another Images and Words song here, this time Under a Glass Moon, is just making this whole album feel irrelevant and been-there-done-that.  However, the song is, I suppose, sort of catchy.  There' some very technically impressive guitar work here, but overall, I'm not having it.<br /><br />Score: 6.5 / 10<br /><br />This Is the Life<br /><br />Okay, this one I don't really get.  The intro riff is really nice, and I to some extent dig Rudess's moogy Rick Wakeman tribute keyboard solo.  However.... lyrics... \\"This is the gift we were born to, our gift divine...\\" ...?  Ummm... is this really really pretentious or arrogant, or just pious and clumsily unpoetic? If you think the gods willed this song as some sort of gift to mankind, I'm afraid that's pretty laughable.  If you're just thanking god for your musical prowess... well... neat.  I get bored during this, and must say I hate the new trend in DT balladish tunes to add .... ugh, you know, I'm bored of writing this review... this album isn't worth the long treatment. Paraphrase:<br /><br />Score: 6.0<br /><br />Bridges In the Sky<br /><br />Great chorus, best vocals by LaBrie on the album, song would have been way better with better lyrics, but LaBrie does a good job making me feel some magic and wonder during the choruses.<br /><br />Score: 7.5 / 10<br /><br />Outcry<br /><br />Arguably the best song on the album.  Some of Rudess's ... I don't want to say hip/hop, but very modern keyboard work really breathes life into this song.  However, the song sort of suffers from the \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" syndrome of being an amazing song with a rambling instrumental that in no way relates to the emotion / storytelling / mood / or point of the music and by the time its done, I don't even care that I was formerly listening to a pretty great Dream Theater song.  And, again... lyrics... YES, STUFF HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN THE SUMMER BEFORE THIS ALBUM'S RELEASE.... LETS TALK ABOUT IT ABSTRACTLY WITH THE DETACHMENT AND A PRETENTIOUS TONE WHILE MAKING NO INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS, SHEDDING NO LIGHT OR PERSPECTIVE, AND DOING NOTHING USEFUL.<br /><br />But... still... a really good song... I might just use an MP3 editor to cut the instrumental and this might be as good as old Dream Theater.<br /><br />7/8 / 10<br /><br />Far From Heaven:<br /><br />And now we are repeating Wait for Sleep.  The lyrics are the first not by Petrucci, while not great, are a lot more honest than anything Petrucci's written to this point.  The song seems to be about a kid wanting to please his parents and unable to deal with the pressure.  Could also be a closeted kid not wanting his secret to get out.  Either way, the music and lyrics are sad, and for the first time in the album I'm feeling for the character that LaBrie dreamed up when writing these lyrics.<br /><br />7/10<br /><br />Learning to Live (Pt. 2) ... erm, sorry, Breaking All Illusions<br /><br />The long awaited lyrical return of John Myung, if aided by Petrucci.  Well, the lyrics, while a little esoteric are at least poetic and sound natural being sung by a human being, which means we've reached the best poetry of the album.  The music is diverse and ranges from Coldplay to Dragonforce to Rush in terms of instrumentation.  There is some good musical comedy in this one, and some cool guitar work.  However, the dated late 80s production and the poor choices in keyboard sounds and guitar production rob what I consider to be a great song from being a good recording.<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Beneath the Surface<br /><br />This song had SO much potential.  The best moment on the album is here (the Coldplay Strawberry Swing syncopated string section elegantly and emotionally backing Rudess's amazing iPad solo which honestly was the best sounding synth sound of the whole album. Also, the lyrics, while again somewhat trite at least seem honest and to come from some place in Petrucci's heart.  LaBrie sings em well enough ,and the guitar work is nice.  Nice is pretty much the right word to use to sum up this song.  Anyhow, if Dream Theater called me right now for advice on their next album (and why not, I'm awesome), I'd encourage them to build on the sound of the bridge cause that was probably the 1 minute of the whole album I was 100% on board with the sound and felt like it was just an organic moment of real music making.  Unfortunately, that moment is followed by LaBrie awkwardly jumping up an octave during a quiet ballad with so much reverb on his voice so we can't hear how bad he sounds these days... erm... giving rise to the most awkward attempted climax of a song ever... I am too embarrassed to listen to this song around people for how much I want to hide under my bed for LaBrie's last verse... ugh... almost such a good sogn<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Okay... I didn't proofread, or stop drinking while writing this, you get what you get.  Have a lovely night all.

B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Like the CD, the price was very good.  Saw the CD at a store and they wanted alot more for it.  This was a good deal.
B008518MOW|4.0|Not as good as Men in Black 1 and 2 but was worth watching.  The special effects in 3D were awesome.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the whole trilogy. I am a little sad that there are no more books.  A very exciting story.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Always loved Kelly Clarkson.  I watched her win American Idol. She has a great voice and great music.  Highly recommend this disc for exercising to.
B0019EXZYE|4.0|I didn't realize this was based on a real life events until after watching the movie all the way through. I had my suspicions while watching because the amount of action in the film is very apparent. This is probably my biggest criticism of the movie, probably caused by my own incorrect expectations.<br /><br />The film is accurate up to a point (as many of them are). A lot of the base details are correct, specifically the robbers leasing a nearby leather shop, digging through the floor, and ultimately coming up through the vault's floor to raid the safe deposit boxes. From there it seems much more speculative as many of the documents chronicling this event are classified and will be for years to come. The ending is the director's best guess given what they know about the surrounding events. Apparently there were several people arrested for this crime in real life, but all of them proclaim their innocence. On the one hand you wouldn't admit you participated in a crime of this magnitude, on the other, there would need to be an scapegoat because of the amount of publicity this story received.<br /><br />The film does a good job chronicling this heist but could have added more excitement into the mix. I would have given it a 3 if it wasn't based on a true story.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Anger Birds - it just makes me angry. But I guess it's fun, although I never get very far. Oh well.
B008JFUUIA|3.0|The storyline in pitch perfect is your usual rooting for the underdogs to pull it together and win the big event. In this case it is an acapella competition. There are two main acapella groups at Borden University, the Treblemakers (all male) and the Borden Bellas (all female). The tremblemakers are the reigning champs due to an unfortunate incident at last year's finals. The Bellas are ready to start fresh and claim the victory.<br /><br />The story follows a freshman with a knack for music. She is great at creating beats and has an impressive voice. She eventually joins up with the Bellas. After repeatedly being upstaged by the Treblemakers, the Bellas come out victorious in the end when new material is added to their routine.<br /><br />My wife was the one who really wanted to see this. Many of her friends mentioned how great and funny it was. There were a few good lines here and there, but mostly the comedy was lacking. Her final opinion was that it was decent. This coming from someone who absolutely loves glee, I was shocked.<br /><br />I had a completely different approach to it. I had no prior knowledge of the movie. This probably worked in my favor as I had no previous misconception of what to expect. The acting is decent, the funny jokes few and far between. The real reason to watch the movie...the performances! As a youth I can remember watching \\"Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?\\" My favorite part was when Rockapella (the name of the group) would sing the theme song. When I heard the performances, my eyes lit up and my love for acapella was renewed. After watching the entire movie once, I used scene selection and played only the performance/concert portions. Yeah, they are that good! The rest of the movie, I can live without.<br /><br />There were a few parts about the movie I thought took away from it slightly.<br /><br />In the beginning, Freshmen are looking at the various groups they can join. The male lead nonchalantly goes over to the Treblemakers and decides to sign up on a whim. This seems like behavior more suited to someone not sure if they'd be accepted into the group, not the person who eventually becomes their top soloist.<br /><br />The other questionable call was during the audition selection when the bellas decide to pick a girl who you can barely hear (it was something that was supposed to be funny, I'm sure). She whispers her way through Kelly Clarkson's Since You're Been Gone. And they picked her! Seriously? For something so dependent on use of your voice, someone like that should have been cut immediately rather than selected.
B004AQR24W|3.0|Okay if your looking for lots of blood and gore, light on acting. Plot is plausable lots of action no boring points in the film
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|Pretty well written and very well acted. It wasn't my favorite Tom Hardy work but the guy who played the teacher was fantastic. I didn't know him from anything else and I think that goes a long way. Most importantly the fighting was believable and fantastic.

B0086700CM|3.0|Got this game for my child and he seems to really enjoy it.  It has really not struck my interest. I will say it is OK but I have not even attempted playing it.  Personally, the sounds of the monkeys is a real turn off  and literally, I make my son turn the sound off when he is playing around me.  He likes it a lot so there must be something enjoyable about it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAMe should not get faster whawn you playing it. it should stay the same slow but meaduim way it do in the begning.and please make a subway surfers2.<br /> ZARR IHA .I. JACKSON
B009WO7NQO|3.0|This game was a little disappointing coming from an angry bird fan like myself.  It really lacked some special individual significance that would have seperated it from the rest of the angry bird games...which kind of made me feel like it was just another angry bird game....blah. Was hoping for more.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is my favorite adaptation of my favorite Jane Austen book. I love this miniseries and watch it over and over.
030758836X|4.0|When I first started reading, I was bored to death.  Tough marriage where neither character was that likable?  I was having a really hard time getting into the book when all of a sudden the first twist hits you and you realize this book isn't anything like you first thought it was.  From that point onward I was hooked and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Telling too much of the story would ruin it as part of the enjoyment for me was knowing nothing prior to opening the book, so lets just say its the story of a husband and wife, neither of which is perfect. This isn't your average bad marriage story though.  No, Gillian Flynn never lets you sit easy but constantly throws surprises at you.  Through plot twists, new parts of the characters psyche's are revealed to the reader.  And you keep reading waiting for the next bomb to drop.<br /><br />A great read, I would definitely recommend it.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|it's great thanks, blah, blah. it's great thanks, blah, blah. it's great thanks, blah, blah.it's great thanks, blah, blah<br />Cool!

B008X9Z37A|2.0|The Belkin Classic Case for Kindle in Blacktop, is about as simple as a case can get. I am describing it as a utility case, for the person who just wants to protect their Kindle and nothing else. No design, no magnetic tab, no strap to keep it closed, no softness to the outside. This case is rough to the touch, It really reminds me of police issued Kevlar, to put knives and pepper spray in. This case means business, and its only business is to wrap around a Kindle and stay there.<br /><br />The inside of it is very soft though, so your Kindle isn't roughed up by its steely exterior. There is not an inside pocket.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|While this movie was visually great, watching it was like watching actors in a video game, complete with levels. Not much of a story, especially disappointing since the last movie (Resident Evil: Afterlife), was great, both visually and story-wise.<br /><br />Worth watching once if you're a RE fan, but even if you are, not worth watching twice.
B000HZED8S|3.0|Enjoyable, but a bit better writing would have gone a long way.  It was a bit slow and a unbelievable.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Pretty good but getting a little old. The writers could have made this MIB jsut as exciting as the other two.
B007IK44CK|4.0|It was a fun movie to watch.  The acting was good and it appeared they had fun making the movie.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I am a Trekkie from way back and although I didn't watch this series when it was on regular TV, now that I have been watching it, I really enjoy this version of Star Trek and how people and episodes from the other series have been incorporated into this one. I had a hard time with Scott Bakula as the Captain at first since all I could think of was him as Sam from Quantum Leap. But he had made the character his own.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a fantastic show! It gets a little soap-opera-y at times, but not so much that you get pulled out of the story.
B00000AFWW|4.0|Having listened to &#34;Live Through This&#34; for weeks on end before returning to &#34;Celebrity Skin--At first CS sounds pastel by comparison--CS is definitely smoother than its predecessor.  But now that I've gotten to know it again on its own merits--I understand why this is Hole's most commercially successful album.  The more prevalent major key melodies takes edge off of Courtney's anger.  Conversely--This album contains Courtney's most memorable lyrics to translate the inevitably angry, searing subtext.  &#34;Awful&#34; sounds practically joyous--Yet its message is not and the contrast is compelling.  Said formula works well throughout the record.  Highlights include: (1) &#34;Northern Star&#34;--a haunting ballad, a cry for help, a prayer.  Is this song about Kurt Cobain?  Maybe ..... and (2) The album's poignant final cut &#34;Petals&#34; wherein Courtney reminisces about the &#34;the sweet boys in the summer of their youth&#34;.  The quasi-orchestral instrumental coda of &#34;Petals&#34; is a brilliant fade-out for this song as well as for the entire record.<br /><br />I'll end with some of my favorite quotes from &#34;Celebrity Skin&#34;:*****<br /><br />&#34;..... A walking study in demonology.&#34;<br />&#34;..... I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh.&#34;<br />&#34;..... So so sugarless / Hooker waitress / Model actress / Oh just go nameless.&#34;<br />&#34;..... I can't be near you / But I just radiate.&#34;<br />&#34;..... Love hangs herself / With the bedsheets in her cell.&#34;<br />&#34;..... I know that you are rotten to the core.&#34;<br />&#34;..... She's the grace of this world / She's too pure / For the likes of this world / This world is a whore.&#34;<br />&#34;..... Tear the petals off of you / Make you tell the truth.&#34;<br /><br />*****For whatever lyrics I misheard--I paraphrase.<br /><br />Stephen C. Bird, Author of &#34;Any Resemblance To A Coincidence Is Accidental&#34;
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wish I read the books before seeing the movie! I usually do, but for some reason I didnt this time. With that being said, the story  is great. The author's writing style is pretty simple yet filled with detail. The plot comes alive and you find yourself rooting for certain characters. Haven't read a book like that in a long time. I think it is a good read for teenagers and young adults because of the issues it addresses as well as the fact that it is written simply so that an teenager may understand. I am currently on the final book of the trilogy, and I must say, I am dreading the end...wish there were more to the series.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I got this free for their free app of the day. it works great. I can control my desktop from my android phone or tablet. Only thing is you have to leave your desktop on of course.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This show makes the whole amazon prime worth it, well this show and the free 2 day shipping lol.<br />The first few episodes are info packed to get you used to the characters then BOOM from the gate almost there is action!!
B004H1V5RU|4.0|We own two other Perplexus balls, the original and the twist.  This is by far the hardest.  Compared to the original which gets progressivly harder this one starts out about where the original leaves off.  Great fun!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Well written, acted and produced.<br /><br />Enjoy Eastwood and Adams so this was a bonus to have them together.<br /><br />Fun Film.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I waited impatiently for this movie to become available to watch on Amazon, and I have to say it was somewhat of a let down. I was expecting, you know like a Jet Airliner becomes disabled somehow, and the pilot saves the day, this is what I expected to see through at least most of the movie, you know like the movie \\"Unstoppable\\" similar but with a Jet. I'm not going to elaborate very much here or I would ruin the movie for viewers, it's a darn good movie..don't get me wrong, but this movie has a lot of angles, and not just about a Passenger Jet crashing.........<br />If you're looking for a \\"thriller\\", ummmm I don't think so, but if you like nudity, sexual activity, drugs, and alcohol, maybe.
B000006U44|5.0|I do have to say.  this CD is one of her very best.  I loved every song on it..  My favorites on the CD were Moving, The Man With The Child In His Eyes.  and The Saxiphone Song.  Nothing not to like about it again.  Would recommend any Kate Bush fans to add this to their music collection.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is the best app in the world if you love  magic and writing or drawing. I say GET IT
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Possibly to technical for some with all the chemical and biological jargon but sure keeps the suspense and interest at a level so I couldn't put it down!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've played a lot of games, and this is the best. You can build whatever you want in creative, or test your survival skills in survival. I own this on kindle fire, xbox, and Pc. Again, best game ever.
B000AP04KQ|5.0|Very funny movie that you can watch over and over and not get sick of. You will either instantly love this movie or not, but if you \\"get\\" this movie, it will become one of your favorites.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|App is well-designed for productivity and runs well on Kindle Fire HD.  I use it mainly for creating checklists to replace my old paper lists.  The calendar is also useful for scheduling purposes.
B00797MB0O|1.0|Here's a drama under the guise of a comedy. It does not succeed as a movie on any level. It wouldn't be so bad had they gave the protagonist just one or two likable qualities. Or, rather, give us something to hold on to. If we are given anything to hang on to, it's the hope that she will eventually learn from all of this and find her ways. Alas... that is only false hope and proves to be too \\"Hollywood\\" and you're left with nothing (except for two hours you'll never get back). You never feel sorry or sad for her. How many good movies have you seen where there was a protagonist that you didn't care for one bit? She appears to be an alcoholic, which is a character flaw many can relate to, but no one feels bad for a person without any redeeming quality. For example... Denzel Washington's character in the recent movie \\"Flight\\" is also a raging alcoholic, and a crack head to boot. There is nothing to like in his character either. However, the audience connects with him because he is divorced and his son wants nothing to do with him. Plus, he saved over 200 lives by flying a plane upside down. (How can you not like that)? You feel for the guy when he struggles to stay sober. The end of that movie was typical Hollywood, but still managed to surprise the audience. This movie on the other hand is terrible, just terrible.
B0053O89YM|3.0|Stories in the Thrid season are not interesting at atll.<br />Season 1 is the best, and Season 3 is very disappointing.
B0069JBKHI|2.0|My husband and I own the Withings scale and sleep monitor and have had nothing but positive things to say about them.  However, the Withings monitor is a completely different story.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Shows the temp and humidity<br />Features we don't use but some may: microphone to talk to baby, light, and music<br /><br />Cons:<br />App is constantly buffering and often shuts down leaving your baby unattended.  (Isn't this the whole point of the monitor????)<br />Expensive for what you get...other brands are much better and cheaper<br />Unless you have a 1\\" crib there is literally no way to mount the monitor.  We have ours dangling on the side of the crib, but will have to move it soon since our son is about to crawl<br />Drains your iphone battery within 2 hours if you have the video monitoring<br />Unlike other brands you cannot use more than one monitor at a time<br /><br />I would not recommend this to anyone.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|you need medals to basically buy all your troops and there kinda hard to come buy but besides that I like the quests and mission the battles are super cool
B0038P59A0|5.0|The movie is exciting and adventurous. It keeps you on your toes while you get to ride along to solve the great mystery with Holmes and Watson. And it wouldn't be great without a twist or turn here or there would it? I very much enjoyed it and think you will too, especially if you're a Sherlock fan!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is so addictive! When I start, I just have to keep playing to get to the next level.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I look forward to every episode of this show .  The entire cast is terrific. The setting is beautiful, and the story lines are compelling.
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  The story was so detailed that I could actually visualize the characters.  I can't wait to see it on the big screen!
B000WS4PCO|5.0|Bought this CD as a gift for my wife.  She loves it, and plays it periodically.  Older U2 music was the best....
145550856X|5.0|My grand-daughter had this book assigned from school and she accidentally spilled a coke all over it.  It was a life saver for her to be able to get the exact book as a replacement so her teacher would not know.
0385504225|5.0|This was a gift for a family member.  He was pleased to receive it, since he is a Dan Brown fan.  Maybe someday I can borrow it.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My new grand-son loves music and animals.  This mobile was great for him when he first went into the baby-bed from the bassinet.
B007JNR518|5.0|It was a really good movie with Robert Redford and Jane Fonda. The plot is not typical and both actors are wonderful.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Beginner, intermediate,or expert you have to appreciate the depth of this book. For one its gorgeous, put together in such a way that anyone could follow. And differing from your traditional cookbook, Tim proclaims this is a book about learning, and he's got that right and then some.<br /><br />He starts with an instruction into learning techniques to master any new skill, language, or career. Then he dissects going to culinary school into sections that make sense and work. From the domestic to the professional you leave the classroom seeing everyone unfolded before you to go back and master what you want, it's Alton you now.<br /><br />This is the very first cookbook that I've actually read from the first page all the way through to the end including the appendix. I read every recipe including the shorthand and steps to completely grasp the information being offered here. After devouring everything that was provided here, now ill step into each section and start learning these methods knowing by the end I won't be a culinary genius, or even a decent cook, but I can damn well impress my family and friends that I can survive in my own kitchen.
B003UESJ9W|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I watched it. I was very disappointed because I thought it included the digital copy too but the one I got did not. I may have not been as careful as I should have been but we will say it was definitely a learning experience to make me more aware the next time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The beginning had me hooked and I thought, wow maybe there was something to this book that made it a best seller. Throughout the first part I kept that same thought. Then the second part came and the interest started to waver. Really? That's where this is heading? And then at then end all I could think was, wtf?!?
B004LQEYAG|4.0|Though this movie recieved awards it was not as good as I had hoped it would be due to fact that two amazing stars were in it.
B005LAIII0|4.0|\\"He said you had a story that would make me believe in God.\\" Pi (Sharma) is a young man living in India trying to find himself. After discovering Krishna he finds Jesus and has to convince his family he is serious about it. When his family falls on hard times they decide to sell their zoo and move to Canada. When an epic storm hits the boat they are traveling on everyone but Pi is lost. Now on a life boat with only a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker to keep him company he must figure out where he is and how to get to land. I have said before that 90% of the way you feel about a movie is the expectations you had for it going in. I expected this to be boring and I was not excited about it at all. Almost from the beginning it had me interested and by the end had totally won me over. This is nothing like I expected at all. The movie is very religious and extremely deep and very thought provoking. By the end you are questioning everything you saw and leaves you wondering what to believe. That is the sign of a good movie, one that leaves you thinking about it long after its over. While I don't think this is the best picture of the year I did like it much much more then I expected and will say its one of the best of the year. Not bad for a movie that I expected to fall asleep watching. Overall, surprisingly good and very much worth seeing, you will be surprised like I was, the trailer does not do the film justice. I give it an A-.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|With a long history in hemp necklaces i was no novice to knotting. I purchased this book as i had just gotten into paracord. I wanted to learn some more complex knots. This book certainly has helped me in that aspect. Thank you J.D.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I gave this five stars because in just the 3 weeks I have been doing her 20 minute workout I can see the results. I've lot 5 lbs and definitely inches I just haven't re measured yet. I love her guidance how to do the exercises correctly to avoid an injury and she gives motivation in JUST the right spots! One thing I will say is this is definitely hard on the knees. She offers modified versions for bad knees but it is still strenuous to the joints. Having the right shoe will really count when using this dvd. I am planning on buying some of her other DVDs after I'm finished with this one. I recommend to anyone who I serious about getting a quality workout in 20 minutes and is committed to really pushing themselves!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|You will become hooked before you know it on this series. Every one will leave you wanting more....what a time!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is amazing and way better than Temple Run will there be a Temple Run 3? Anyways I think everyone who has a device should have this game and if you think it is not for you give it a chance trust me it is amazing I play it everywhere even on the bus.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I absolutely loved this show.  I had heard it was very good, but I never imagine it was going to be this great.  I'm almost done with season 2 and I can't wait for the fall for season 3.  Even my husband is so hooked that he's already thinking of purchasing all the seasons.  He said it's a MUST have and I second that.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book it was amazing<br /><br />You really did a great job Rick Riordan I did love Percy Jackson
B0063IH60K|2.0|game seemed cheesy.  not very professionaly presented. game worked but not even to the standard set by microsoft windows version.
B0086700CM|4.0|I LOVE this game!! Great for kids and adults alike. This is a must get game. You always want to beat your high score. I've had this for like, a year and I still find it fun!!!! I would rate it 5 stars but I've had several glitches, but I think it was because of another app. I love temple run! Excellent graphics and shop. LOVE LOVE LOVE.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I really like this book and I recommend it to anyone who's read any other diary of a wimpy kid book before.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Nice guide, good advice. Almost everything you need to know about the zombie apocalypse, the historical accounts are scary and creepy.
159562015X|4.0|I found this very interesting, the diversity of strengths and the further definition of the strengths. My only complaint is that I almost think there are too many. Also, I would have liked a practice run of the assessment, such as a few example questions in order to familiarize yourself with the style of questions before the times assessment began.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think every classroom in America should experience Wonder. It taught me personally to have more  empathy for others and opened up dialog between me and my kids on the subject of bullying.
B00A7H2NC4|5.0|So I'm gonna say right now that I'm a huge Frank Miller fan so my review might be a little biased but there's no denying that sin city is a great comic that lasted for seven volumes  and one of the unique things about sin city is that the main character of each volume aren't really hero's but they personified their city that they live in and why the city is called SIN city also is that they aren't bad people ( for the most part) but rather thy are caught in a bad situation and have to do bad things to get out of it and one more thing is that the artwork is awesome if you liked how Frank's art sucked you in the dark knight returns then you'll love this even though the color is black an white Frank surprisingly knows how to use them in at the right moment with that said go check it out you'll won't be disappointed
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is so lovely to watch this series, that I missed originally.  Beautiful!  The clothing is gorgeous and the scenery lovley.
0307592731|4.0|Pretty good story, well written. Why would anyone buy an edition annotated and highlighted by Oprah?? This reminds me of  when Garrison Keillor changed or omitted words he considered offensive in one of Mark Twain's books, without considering the time in which it was written.  Can't we all think for ourselves?<br /><br />We need to remember that Cheryl was pretty young when she decided to walk the PCT. I know I have done stupid things in my life, but probably not as stupid as not being prepared for a momentous and long-term hike. I would have over-prepared, if anything. She was lucky so many people were willing to help her along the way, but also she used her head and came up with solutions to some thorny problems, like making booties out of duct tape. That cannot have been comfortable. And her problems with her feet - she didn't set out to buy the wrong size boot, although she should have tried them out more before starting.<br /><br />She should have left out some things: many of the bits about sex got pretty tiresome, and I wish I hadn't had to read the part about the horse. Poor horse. Also the comment about masturbation, and the sponge she used when she got her period. Makes me wonder what she left out.<br /><br />I, too, would have liked a little more introspection at the end. It did end rather abruptly. Having said that, I do think it was a good read, it kept my interest, and moved along at a nice pace (no pun).
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I did not watch Downton Abbey when it first aired on PBS; however, now that I've started, I am hooked!  When Season 3 began, we decided to DVR it, as I was told I should see Seasons 1 and 2 first.  We Netflixed Season 1; however, Season 2 was unavailable on Netflix and at our public library.  We couldn't wait, therefore we purchased Season 2 on Amazon and it didn't disappoint.  The scenery, the characters, and the actors and actresses who portray them are wonderful...Maggie Smith, of course, being my favorite!  The historical allusion, to my knowledge, is on point in this gripping tale that always leaves me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait to begin Season 3.  Enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|too much noise...and too little thrill, nothing exceptional.<br />Is not even an erotic novel, it seems like an old Corin Tellado pink novel
B007B8EX9I|5.0|I'm very picky about what I watch. Usually after two episodes, I turn to something else. When I read the description of Downton Abbey, it didn't sound like anything I'd care about. The reviews were so good though, I gave it a try. So glad I did! I watched the first two seasons on Prime, and then watched them again. The acting is fantastic, the characters engaging. You really learn to either love them or hate them. I can hardly wait to watch season 3.
B002KT3XH6|4.0|It's a little draggy in spots but probably closer to the actual history than most tales. I am still enjoying it.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Ordered for Christmas present and received on time and with no issues.  Price was better than ordering all through iTunes.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Allowing for the fact that this is a free app it is fun to play. I enjoy playing it and my 6 year old grandson really enjoys playing it.<br />All in all it is worth every penny we paid for it.
0307341550|5.0|Gillian did it again! This was a suspenseful book a real who done it type of story! It's a quick read. I'm now on to Gone Girl. Another one of Gillian's greats!
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Love them should have won the grammy.  They are so good.  Amzing voices.  Really love brittanys voice brings back memories of woodstock.  These artists will probably go far maybe next year they will get the grammy.  Love their sound.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|great fun game; love it so much I didn't want to take time out to rate it; totally a 5 star game:)
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Interesting movie.  The info is relevant and necessary for the people and I think that all people must watch it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Who could not love the Wonderful Wizard of Oz book!!! The whole family enjoys reading it together. And it was free!!
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Had no issues streaming this content and I would recommend my friends to watch this.<br />Also, would like to watch more content like this
B005CA4SJW|3.0|When I opened the DVD case the plastic on the inside was shattered, but luckily the DVDs weren't broken as well.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this film and would hardily recomment it!  Absolutely entertaining! Jodie Foster did a great job!  We love her films.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I liked the book but it wouldn't be good for little kids. But other than that it is really good book:)
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|This season continues the great story of the NCIS team  - Intelligent mystery and comedy perfectly married.  My favorite part is the building of the Zeva David character after her entrance in Season 3.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best and I would recommend this game it is the best but you need to update the game and have lower prices for stuff in the game
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I loved this show, all seasons! It was so awesome! Loved the characters.  Please get more of these British period pieces!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is a trilogy series, after the first book ..... hold on, it's great!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|luv it<br />game starts out slow but once u get into it its not so bad! lots of fun for kids and adults to play
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Written very well, hard to put down, don't want it to end. Highly recommend the entire trilogy set. A very good read!!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I loved this book.  But I love to read all kinds of historical fiction especially Phillipa Gregory.  I have read everything<br />she has ever written and am always waiting for something new from her. I have not read anything from her for about a year<br />because there was nothing I hadn't already read. I gave this book to my mom and like myself she could not put it down.<br />I want to order it again when it is available but this won't happen until April.  I want to purchase it for my mo ther in law, but<br />she wouldn't be able to figure out my kindle so she needs the book.  She is 88 and also loves these books.
1423113497|5.0|Very nice set of books that I ordered to give as a gift.  I was very impressed with this item and I'm sure the young boy who received them was thrilled.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|A very fun app, and a nice way to pass the time.  Any bronies out there curious about it should definitely give it a try.  However, if you're not too keen on farming games, then it might not be for you.
B007IK44CK|4.0|a good MI movie with gadgets, suspense and all one expects from this franchise.  i liked it just fine dude (had to add extra words to get review accepted).
1476712042|5.0|I loved this book, read it twice, could not wait to get back to it each time I put it down,.  Very good read and totally different from some of the books I have read.  I am looking forward to the sequel.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Definitely  another strong showing from nevo. Little irritating that it takes the 2nd game to finish one story but since I had already bought it I can't be too upset.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Wonderful.  Ken Follett nails it again with a multi-family tale of WW1 era.  Enjoyable read. Can't wait to start the sequel!
B002JWD6AS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Once I picked it up, I could not put it down. Can't wait to read the next book in this trilogy.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I can't wait to see the second season. Everything about the series is top rate: writing, acting, story, filming. Truly an outstanding series.
B001KMB6X2|1.0|The movie I received from this seller was just a bad, cheap homemade copy. It was actually missing large portions of the movie-and I've seen this movie a few times before deciding to buy it, so I know when I'm being ripped off and parts are missing! Not worth my time and money to return so I will be purchasing a new one elsewhere!!
B006WXHJNU|4.0|I'm a huge Marvel fan but I'll admit that Hulk is one of my least favorite characters. Regardless, this movie is much better than Ang Lee's 2003 attempt.
B005OHSD3A|2.0|The print is very small for a senior citizen to read.  The menus are very restricting and difficult to follow.  The book arrived with torn pages but was told I could keep the book without payment.  To bad this book did not fulfill my expectations!
0143038583|5.0|This book is quite the eye-opener, and I recommend it for EVERYONE. Michael Pollan's account of the food industry is thorough but keeps the mood from getting too dark at the same time. His use of irony and humor is a boon, considering how this subject can very quickly cause one to be depressed.<br /><br />If there was any book I would want people to read, it would be this one (and maybe Animal Liberation by Peter Singer, also mentioned in this book). Everyone in America should know where their food comes from, as we cannot rely on &#34;scientists&#34; and the government to tell us everything we need to know about what goes into our bodies. Self-reliance and knowledge only comes with seeking the truth, even though we would rather close our eyes and continue living in blissful ignorance.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Did not like this book at all. Terrible sTory line. How depressing to think how people could deceive each other and take a relationship to such a depressing level.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|A Christmas present for my brother, who loves Halo. I'm a big fan of the story of Halo, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as well. My only criticism is that it's not a full-length movie! Master Chief is larger than life, and I really hope to see more of this kind of thing in the future from 343 Industries.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its the best game ever get the app u will love it I got the app and I loved it trust me this game can have 2 -idk but a lot of players at a time so fun
0345536886|5.0|The Litigators....This is a fun and eye opening book. it is very informative if lawyers behave this way for real.  Anyone except a lawyer would love it.
0307887448|5.0|As someone who graduated from high school in the 80s (as well as the parent of a teen computer geek who spends too much time online interacting in cyberspace with his \\"friends\\" than in person), I waxed nostalgic while reading this futuristic,  fast-paced, cleverly-plotted story about a nerdy, independent, young man with mad computer skills whose goes from obscurity to infamy the instant he becomes the first person to maneuver his way through a virtual world called OASIS and traverse the first gate (of several) on the way to potentially inheriting (The Westing Game-like) its creator's vast fortune. The ongoing element of danger (it'd be pretty easy to get killed even though participants' screen identities are supposedly secret) adds suspense as does the fact that so many persons are attempting to achieve the same feat. Once a reader reaches about the two-thirds' point, they won't have to be a rocket scientist (or computer nerd) to figure out how it's going to end, but watching Wade and his friends trying to stay alive long enough to complete their quests to become rich and famous makes for some really good reading.<br /><br />Best of the book, the author's EXTREME (not yellin', just tellin') knowledge of 80s trivia (both fun for me to relive and extremely helpful for players attempting to complete the quest). Worst: the moment you realize how it's probably going to end (and does). In summary, fast-paced, unique, cleverly-plotted story will be of interest to 80s freaks, computer geeks and everyone in between. Also good: Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card, Divergent by Veronica Roth and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.
B00A757EFW|1.0|Downloaded this on my kindle for the hubby to play.  It only lasted a few minutes as it was more aof a sneak peak beofre actually buying the game.  Hubby wasnt impressed.  It probably said in the description that is was a sample only and i just missed it.  If you are looking for the full version game dont download this one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I rate this book an 5<br />I liked everything about the book and I recommended it to a friend and sisters
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I have the computer version and love it but this one just didnt do it for me.  It needed a tutorial...if it has one i missed it.  I just didnt enjoy this version.
B0013O123Q|4.0|After the smoke clears and you get your head around the stylistic editing, the story was absolutely one dimensional and far too simple. I did appreciate what they were going for and applaud the style and unique approach. Just too simple.
B004EF65QA|5.0|The book is so much better than the movie!  I enjoyed all the extra parts the movie could not include.
1401917232|5.0|Hello.  I just got an email from Gary Renard stating that the release date is October 8, 2013.  Great News!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is funny and delightful!  It keeps you laughing the whole time. It also has a nice romantic side.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Couldn't put this book down. Loved it! Author has a great imagination and creativity. It had my heart thumping with Jack's!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is an amazing trilogy! It takes you on a journey and I can not wait to see the movie!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was an awesome read. I could not stop reading the books! I don't want to ruin them but I will say they changed and left things out of the movie. Some were important and others not so much.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|The alarm works fine, I just wish it was louder. Everytime I forget and leave my Kindle out where my cat can reach it, she sleeps on top of it and that tends to muffle the alarm. :)
0865479186|3.0|Author Goldacre provides a readable summary of why one needs to take claims about various therapies and pills with a grain of salt - they're instead quite likely to be totally fraudulent or at least overstated thanks to various errors (often deliberate) in their assessment. On the other hand, for those with some scientific background and/or familiarity with eg. how drug companies manipulate clinical trails, there's little new here.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I loved this true story of the akita dog and it's loyalty to its master......please suggest more of these type movies....i also liked 8 below, another dog story
B00AHXIC50|2.0|I love Bruno Mars and his music, I was frustrated that I had to download the player to my phone just so I could hear it instead of adding it to my already-made music library. So instead of listening to the music combined or shuffled with my previous purchased music I instead have to use one player to listen to this album and then use my other player for the rest of my music. Was tedious that I ended up having to transfer all my other music to the amazon player. Only cause it was cheaper then itunes did I use amazon.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Really it is hard to rate. Def not a 4-5 star movie but not a 1.<br />The problems<br />1) First 10min is a TnA movie. Not that I have a problem but they went out of the way to keep the nude shots in.<br />2) Length - 99% of the movie it is his inability to stop drinking then in less than a 2min window one question poof.. over it. In the next 5min the story ends.<br /><br />The good<br />3) acting is solid. Not his best but good. That is about all I got.<br /><br />If you want to waste $5 and nothing else to pick from go for it. Had I know I would have watched just about anything else.
B003UESJF6|3.0|Loved the movie, but the case came in cruddy condition, like a dog got a hold of it or something.
0345528581|4.0|A lot to read but very inspiring. The ability to work out anywhere is a great idea. The author tells a great story.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the staging, costuming, mix of storylines etc.  Excited to see the stories continue and love the continuity with history.
0198534469|5.0|I absolutely love how the author shows everything he talks about visually. Superb diagrams and intuitive explanations. Really, every math book should be written like this. If you want to understand not just complex analysis but increase your intuitive understanding of mathematical analysis in general (great for science or engineering!), do yourself a favor and GET THIS BOOK NOW.
B005KELQEU|4.0|nicely does the job!  ...good value!  It is missing the carry handle that is illustrated in the on-line advertisement, but that is no great drawback!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an amazing book. It has got to be my 2nd favorite book. I loved this book and I hope other people do to.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|Do not rent, buy or watch this movie unless you like movies that waste your time and make you angry.  Terrible special effects, plot line was predicable and ending makes you think the movie producers intentionally ended it the way they did just to make the viewers angry.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Good action packed flick Wahlberg does a great job portraying the secluded xsniper who ultimately out smarts the government setup he was placed in.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this to go with a kukri machete i also had purchased knowing from reviews on the blade it would show up pretty dull.  Boy were they right, the blade showed up with a flat edge... ok, so i knew it i guess.  But after running only 10 passes through this little guy the blade was sharp enough to open one of the plastic wrappings they use on all sorts of products... ya know, the kind that are almost impossible to open without using the jaws of life... well my new blade sliced through it with no problems.  So if you are looking for a pocket sized sharpener that will do what is is supposed to then pick this one up.<br /><br />YOUR WELCOME IN ADVANCE!!!  :)
B009ERK1T0|5.0|expansive assault ,turn up loud  / / / / // / / / / / / / / / / /
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Excellent it's very good however when I go on it tells me about the coin fixer but apart from that really good and its fast aswell
B000023VR6|5.0|love all the artist's ,dre top of the game  / / // / / / / // / / / / /
B0052AC8C6|3.0|Phenomenal graphics. Okay story. Funny voices with few chuckles. Of course, while not over the top, it had to include the obligatory social commentary . . . nature good - rich people naturally want to destroy it. Tiresome.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|pretty good free app.i wish the touch screen function worked better on the kindle fire but either way its a great app
B006O2QNOU|3.0|Enjoyed the movie because I enjoy movies about the markets.  I thought the short quips about this and that could have been enhanced, but were probably done that way because of budget constraints.  The end dialogue between Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Irons was instructive.  Overall, I rate the movie a three.  I had to strain to hear the muted and mumbled dialogue.  The most exciting part where an actor spoke up is when they fired people.  Typical American conduct.  We have a weird fetish about firing people in our great country.
B008469DGY|3.0|Didn't mean to download this. I thought I was getting the flick soccer. Not a golf fan but it was only $2 so I will just remove it. :0/
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great quality - and the show is fantastic. We are well into the 3rd Season which is turning out to be great also.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a fantastic show. I have enjoyed Season 1 & 2. Can't wait till Season 3 is added to Prime.
B005I64U5C|5.0|Great price for an awesome movie! 3D just makes it that much better!  Good special effects and acting make this one a keeper!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show and so does everyone else.  If you don't like it, something might be wrong with you.  I don't like that they split it up, but this season is great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The whole family likes this game.  My daughter had it so I tried it. now I have it on my tablet.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I have read all the books twice and several 3 times! love the books and all the movies! I wish she would continue with his adult life with their children!
B008458O3S|3.0|I like the game but still trying to figure out how to make 4 become 2 and become four again
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I have read all the books twice and several 3 times! love the books and all the movies! I wish she would continue with his adult life with their children!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Graphics are excellent.  Would be nice to be able to carry more than a single weapon.  Well worth the  price!  I would definitely recomend for those who like this style of game.
B005OC5CLQ|5.0|My wife bought this and loves it! listens it it all the time! she loves country music and says this is a good CD!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Phillp's voice is a catch.  He will continue to have great success as his music career takes off.  Home is a hit! He has what it takes and I look forward to his next CD.
0545128285|5.0|I have read all the books twice and several 3 times! love the books and all the movies! I wish she would continue with his adult life with their children!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This band is amazing.  I look forward to their next CD.  They have a specific flare all their own. Don't pass this one up!
0439321603|5.0|I have read all the books twice and several 3 times! love the books and all the movies! I wish she would contue the story in their adult life and with their children!
B006R1T40I|5.0|Bonnie has one of those soulfull voices that stand out no matter what she sings.  This album just reaffirms that.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I loved the action and the CGI effects were awsome! very good plot and ending! will watch again! good value!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mumford and Sons have hit the nail on the head with this CD.  They have that toe tapping quality and insight lyrics that make you want more.  Great CD.
0316228532|2.0|My wife purchased this book because she liked the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; series of books. She told me that she got only half way through the book and finally gave up on it.
B003L20ICE|3.0|This movie could have been a great movie.  Interesting non the less.  The soundtrack is pretty good. I'm glad I waited for it to come out on DVD.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|We haven't used it much as we have a solor powered calculator, so I guess this is sort of an unfair evaluation. It's much easier using the solar powered calculator than having to wait for the Kindle  to warm up to use this calculator. But the price was right though...
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|If you like Train's music then you will like this CD as well.  They are only getting better.  I look forward to their next CD.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It was the best horse game I have ever played I loved how you could take care of the horse and compete with computer players
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|They may have been around a while, but they have hit the spot light.  This is truely a great CD.  Don't pass this one up!!!
B00008BRB5|5.0|Too bad this was their last.  Of course there is 80s poppy &#34;Every Breath You Take&#34;, but beyond that one is classic Police.  Can def hear the world music influence.
B00003CY6M|4.0|This movie just makes you feel good.  This is a movie you curl up on the couch and watch when it's raining or snowing outside.
B003DZX3US|4.0|This is just one of the many collectable special editions I have purchased mainly for my wife who likes to collect such things and we both loves the extra features
B00723NWJE|3.0|This CD was a little lackluster for me.  I usually love her soulfull voice but this CD just didn't do it for me.
B001ILFUD2|4.0|This is just one of the many collectable special editions I have purchased mainly for my wife who likes to collect such things and we both loves the extra features
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the other two books and couldn't wait to find out who this book ended. It is a book for teens and older.
B00003CXB4|4.0|This is just one of the many collectable special editions I have purchased mainly for my wife who likes to collect such things and we both loves the extra features
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I am glad I got this app, the Holy Bible was the only one I didn't have. It is easy it use you just click at the top and tell it where you want to go.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Peter Jacksons spectaular second volume of the trilogy had vast scope withthe battles it portrays and the backdrop of its scenery and venues.
B008K8U13K|5.0|He has been asking for this for quite a while and I finally gave in. He loves Mario and Sonic so he loves this game.
B000XUOIQ4|4.0|This is just one of the many collectable special editions I have purchased mainly for my wife who likes to collect such things and we both loves the extra features
B000AGTPUU|5.0|EXCELLENT entertainment!!! We totally enjoyed this movie! The fantasy of it had us captivated from the beginning. We no doubt will make this part of our Christmas time ritual.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|Loved it.  Hate review the review requirements. a reviews shouldn't have a word limit. Its how I feel about the purchase I made. Thats why I dont do them.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great show. I missed the first Season but have caught up. Explaines much I didnt understand from when I started
B0017SWPXY|4.0|If your dog is human like mine are you will really appreciate this tale.  It is heartwarming and real.  Great for a rainy afternoon.
B00AZ3KPZC|4.0|The audio /video quality is top notch however because hdtv is 16x9 disney started including black border art that matches the scene from the window so it looks widescreen not fullscreen and because the tile art looks like the blu ray i expected that at least the HD edition would include the border art so while everything else is great i can only give 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />If amazon puts in the border art then i'd give it 5/5 .
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|My favorite story in a very long time, worth every minute of my time. I was glad to see a new twist every episode.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|You can go home again....almost, great to see the show with Jean Marsh - too bad this was canceled after such a short run - probably due to Ms. Marsh's illness and disinterest by the public...
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I do not like the fact that you need to get points to get games and also you have to complete a game to get the whole points
1451695187|5.0|A book which must be read first and then studied, using all available information including scripture. Consultation with others and with pastor of Church, and members of Bible class. Most certainly an incredible experience. We sometimes forget how much mystery there is in the world.<br />Scripture tells we are incarnate spirits, a concept reinforced in Eben's book. Check 1st Corinthians ch. 15.<br />Strange things do happen...
B005H9B44A|3.0|This movie has all of what you generally expect from a superhero movie, but nothing that makes it outstanding. It's ok for a time filler or if you have some popcorn left over from the previous movie. Natalie Portman is always cute, but if she's the reason you're watching, choose another NP movie and you'll be happier. She's a lot cuter in Honey. Not the fantasy, the movie. ;)<br /><br />One thing this movie might be good for is if you want to know the origin of Thor, then this movie will provide that, if it's true to comic history. I don't want to discourage anyone from seeing this movie sometime, but if there's another that you already have in mind that you'd like to see, see that one first.
B002RI9VVM|3.0|I really don't remember making this purchase. Was it a download? When was it?  I wonder where it went ?
B001XUPGLY|2.0|I saw the movie when it came out when I was younger and recall liking it well enough, but it did not age well.  I actually found it a bit hard to watch at this point, though still consider myself a star trek fan.  I have enjoyed the latest movies to come which feel much less campy then the ones from this era.
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|You get a good number of interesting missions to fly for free.<br /><br />I like it in either mode (Joystick or Screen Tilt). It is not an easy thing to control, so you ought to practice with it on each mission. On the Kindle Fire HD, turn sound off for longer battery life.<br /><br />I do not know if I would buy it, but if you learn to control it pretty well, it would be a neat game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very great. I am right now on my expedition to get all of the characters.You should get this game if you are a fan of temple run.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|OMFG this is awesome way better then temple run,  temple run 2 is the best so amazing and it has better graphics which is the best part, temple tin 2 is the best and I love it it is so AWESOME I like this GAME!!!!!!!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Thank God for Dave Grohl and his ability to keep the faint spark of rock music burning.  A very well done documentary detailing the Sound City studio and the artists and staff that made it the hit factory it was for all those years.  The last part about bringing together the artists that made it famous for a new project was unexpected and shows Grohl's love for the craft of making music.  Highly recommended to anyone who loves rock music.
B005GK6QAM|5.0|Another GEM<br />THis proofs the fathers of Rock are still alive and kicking<br />Every single song is outstanding<br />Buy it you will like it
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A CAPTIVATING BOOK.  I couldn't put it down. One of the best books I've read in years.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B0087WRGVY|4.0|Pros<br />Great music and vocals<br />Look for video in you tube<br />Bands like this make<br />Cons<br />Weak lyrics- not fan of the inside photo
B00A77II0U|5.0|I really enjoyed the game.  Very challenging and kept my interest. Looking forward to purchasing another game. Graphics were great. Interesting storyline. The clown was freaky looking and disturbing. It may be a bit too disturbing for young children. The hidden pictures are pretty challenging but fun. I wish I would not have completed it so quickly. Now I have to buy another game because I truly enjoyed this one.
B005GK6QSO|5.0|Great vocals<br />Great music<br />Great lyrics<br />Outstanding<br />Must have for any fan of Rock<br />simply magnificent<br />cant wait for a second album
B000001GS2|5.0|Wonderful recording. I have listened to other recordings of this opera and although they are nice recordings in their own way, the Karajan recording is distinct and superb. The tempi are just right, the dynamics are all as in the score, and the subtle nuances and changes in tempi are simply delightful. Karajan approaches this opera with a musical concept different from that of his predecessors and we see what can be done with this beautiful music other than playing it in a routine, straightforward way.<br />The singers are excellent as well. The orchestra plays it well and follows Karajan pefectly, and I noticed just one entrance in the first measure of the intermezzo where the strings are not completely together. There is one cut in act I, but it is a traditional one. If I am correct, I think it is in the prologue that an empty measure has been eliminated. All said, it is a recording I am glad I purchased.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. Easy to play. Its great to be a free product. Would love to see more like this one.
0525478817|5.0|The title pretty much says it all. Regardless of the type of book you like to read, John Green has written one of the best books in the past decade. It's a roller coaster of a book. You won't regret buying this book :)
B005CWRB44|5.0|Great flashlight for travel, or anytime. It is so small you wouldn't think it had much power but it is great.
B009UZLRJE|4.0|Its a non stop laughing comedy every time I saw it, I recommend it and its great the comments on blu ray
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I got this app for my kindle. I like to follow a lot of people, I don't tweet myself.  It is very interesting to see what the different people are saying. It works great on the kindle.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|When I listen to the soundtrack, it takes me back to the different parts of the movie, where I can then relive the experience.  It also entices me to go see it again.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|As I was reading this book, I kept thinking &#34;This can't be what it's implying.  I'm sure I misread something.&#34;  It just got worse and worse and so I completely abandoned it.  It is not an uplifting read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey.  It has drawn me in and keeps me anticipating the next episode.  The mix of characters' personalities and the contrast between the servants and their masters is quite intriguing.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I loved the movie and love this CD.  I play it during the day skipping the song that are not as pleasing.
B0000844I8|5.0|It's Stargate, what more do you need to know? It's an excellent Sci-fi with a amazing story and a awesome cast.
B008NMT684|5.0|My two year old son loves this app. It is very colorful and has lots of engaging features. His favorite one is popping the balloons when he finishes the puzzles.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|A wonderful remastering of a classic. This movie was great at the start and all the addons were just icing on the cake. None of them got in the way of the movie, but they're there if you want them.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I enjoyed this story in spite of the fact it was somewhat dark at times. Families and people are complex and I felt she captured this.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|play all day long it is worth it and of course you can get into it it is worth getting
B0083GQKQG|4.0|This was a creepy movie.  Tilda Swinton did a good job with the part of Kevin's mom.  In light of the recent school shootings, this movie was shocking.  Makes you wonder how many 'Kevins' there are out there, that are ticking timebombs.  The ending was quite unexpected. This movie is not for kids...I would recommend for the intended audience.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|great game, hours you can spend on this game levels are great getting harder and harder but you can do it
