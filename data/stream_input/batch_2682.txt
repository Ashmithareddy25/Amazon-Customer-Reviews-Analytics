B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Still action hero though getting long in the tooth... Bruce Willis is still hard and tough in a busy fast paced action flick.
B005K15XR4|5.0|This album is fantastic. Since it arrived it hasn't left my car's CD player. It has some great tracks to build you up and some that are very relaxing. The few that feature female vocalist Aya Peard are phenomenal and she has an extremely beautiful voice. I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys high quality music.
0307895505|5.0|Getting through Skyrim without this book is possible but not nearly as pleasant! Good illustrations, good tips and great information on quests and walkthroughs.
B008Y73940|4.0|I liked the twists and turns of the movie as he battled doing what was right versus what was legal.<br />Good ending, kept you in suspense.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Great book really enjoyed it and it makes you think about life and what we should be doing with it but very cleverly done read it in a matter of days was totally caught up in it
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This movie was unique, surprising, and genre-breaking.  It had a delightful mix of action, humor, and romance.  The perspective of the zombie's point of view put a refreshing spin on the trendy zombie theme.  Will definitely watch again!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is worth the wait and I'm sure spending the extra ten dollars to get the full version will be worth every cent!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I love this movie - Richard Armitage is surprisingly exceptional in this role as a Byronic hero - dark, gruff, uncouth, and yet oh so tantalizing!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Definitely a page turner. You never know what is going to happen next, and you won't want to put it down. Great book, recommend for anyone.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Got this for hubby for Father's Day and we both were drawn in by the first episode!  Every night once the kids were in bed we rushed to watch it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game how u get to defeat vector and upgrade to all these cool and awesome gadgets and get in touch with the characters from despicable me
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|I remember watching Matilda as a child and loving it. It's a great family movie and I enjoyed watching it again with my little brothers. We need more movies like this
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I have no idea how Adam Johnson managed to create a story so thorough, and so compelling. I could not put it down.<br />The Pulitzer  was well deserved.
1118488768|5.0|There's nothing more to say than this is a perfect book. It is genuinely insightful and generous. I recommend it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Pretty good. Not life changing, but pretty darn good entertaining read. If your planning on sitting on a beach and reading, this one will do.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Unlike some others, I was quite pleased with how Charlaine Harris ended her series.  I'm just sad the series ended.
0345541588|5.0|Jack Reacher always ends up kicking butt and taking names.  This one really twisted around unexpectedly, I really expected the bureaucrat to be the bad guy.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This quaint love story set in the Irish countryside is eloquently written , incorporating Irish brogue. The characters are made real to life in an Irish farming town. Good twists!
B008J05EL8|3.0|The fonts should have come as a part of the Office Suite in the first place. It is kind of a rip off!
B0015DWJX2|2.0|I don't like this type of &#34;letter &#34; format of writing and there is no substance to it, but I will continue to give it a try.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So cute! I don't even have kids and I play it all the time! Just recommended it to my friend that has two very amazing boys that love the movie.
B0065FIHYA|5.0|I love this movie.  It is visual candy to the extreme.  Mickey Rourke is amazing and his character is ruthless but principled, he'll just flat out kill you in a flash if you need killing. Graphic violence.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I bought this movie for my students.  It's a kid-friendly, fun way to learn about saving the earth.  My grandchildren and I love this movie, time after time!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show was recommended to me by my mother. I normally do not enjoy this type of show but I was pleasantly surprised. I was sucked in by the first episode and couldn't stop watching it. Can't wait for the next season to start.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Its an awesome game but Too short wish there would be more chapters to play. Need a update with new chapters fast :D :D
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I enjoyed reading this one, but would reccomend the 4 book one instead as you will want to read them anyway
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The latest update is terrible. Much too difficult to use. I uninstalled it and found a much better weather app. The Weather Channel used to be very helpful, but the latest update ruined it. Why would they do that?
B005R32L66|5.0|I have had this installed on my computers since it was free in beta, I will keep using it until it gets too expensive, which will no doubt be soon!
B000FC2OHA|5.0|I have been working on many aspects of my life for a while.  Never have I found such a comprehensive guide that addresses all of the aspects at once.  I want my spiritual growth to match my personal growth and this book has given me tools to look at where I am at and gives me step-by-step ideas to get where I want to go.  I look forward to working more closely with this program and hope to meet Jack Canfield in further training sessions in the future.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|ozzy is still there and always will be the only original Black Sabbath.  Forget the Dio days when Sabbath lost their way.  It's good to to have Ozzy and the boys back again.  No doubt.
B002SHD9E2|2.0|I watched this and almost fell asleep. I didn't even care about the characters until the last scene. It seemed monotonous, and the only saving grace was Emmy Rossum's voice.
B0054LJGWS|4.0|I adore Good Omens, and since I travel a few times a year and Amazon was running a $2.99 promotion, I thought it would be a great addition to my Kindle. However, the Kindle edition seems to be somewhat different from my paperback copy-- it seems to be entirely missing all footnotes and a considerable amount of supplementary material. Am I mistaken?<br /><br />I'm not sure whether it's a case of the Kindle edition being the text of the original copy and my having the American version of the paperback (I've heard the American addition has considerably more material). However, my Kindle edition doesn't have the interlude with Elvis, the anecdote about Sable's real surname, the footnotes about Greasy Johnson, or many other asides.<br /><br />I'm still happy to have the edition on my Kindle, but heartily recommend reading the full edition.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|I watched Dr. Mosely's PBS documentary on intermittent fasting and have also watched documentaries on calorie restricted optimal nutrition (CRON) diets.  I find the research to be fascinating and was intrigued enough by the documentary to purchase the book for more information.  I think the first half of the book presented the information found in the documentary quite well and attempted to answer some of the questions people may have after viewing the documentary.  As with the documentary, he explains ongoing research at major universities and explains that these various types of calorie restriction pertain to longevity studies that decrease typical diseases of aging.  The second half of the book seemed rather unnecessary, providing food tables that can be found anywhere online.  It also provided some unnecessary space filler of people's blog posts who review the diet.  While they recommend some menu choices for 500 and 600 calorie meals, they also have created a recipe book that you have to purchase separately.  I would have preferred some of the recipes over the blog posts.  I think it's best to view the documentary and then decide if you want to purchase the book knowing that the book is a short read that will put into writing what you have already seen on the documentary.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I have a kindle fire HD this is  awesome on a big screen but the updates come later then iPods and don't think of deleting it to get the update because it will come.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I originally stumbled upon the basics of this remarkable story on Snopes.com while verifying another unauthenticated story.<br />In short, this is about German ace fighter pilot Franz Stigler's singular act of gallantry when he spared the lives of American bomber pilot Charlie Brown and his surviving crewmen while they struggled to stay aloft in their grievously damaged B-17.<br />Brown's B-17 was a proverbial sitting duck when Stigler approached it with his Bf 109's gun magazines fully loaded, but Stigler's hand was stayed when he was able to see how helpless they were, with blood dripping from the gun from their killed tail gunner, Hugh \\"Ecky\\" Eckenrode.<br />What happened for the next ten minutes was even more amazing.<br /><br />I'm not going to put out any spoilers here, even though the final chapters of this are out there, but I will admit that I struggled through the final pages of this book through a veil of tears.<br />Adam Makos did a superb job with this, his first book, and he started it out just right in his forward, in which he dispels the myth that all those who served in the German military during WWII were Nazis.<br />Much to my surprise, as it turns out very few who served were actual Nazi party members at all, including one Lieutenant Franz Stigler.<br />Makos helps put the story in full context by describing the lives of both Stigler and Brown in detail, from their youth through their service during WWII and through the decades that followed.<br />It's interesting that there was quite a bit more about Stigler, but in all fairness, Stigler had far more missions and served for a longer time.<br />However, the details about Brown were more than enough to give the reader a full picture of his life.<br />What I found particularly fascinating was the struggle the rank and file men in the Luftwaffe (German air force) had with Herman Goering, and how much so many of them detested him, especially the more honorable men.<br />We learn about such Luftwaffelegends as Gustav Rödel, Walter Krupinski, Adolf Galland, Johannes Steinhoff, Günther Lützow, Eric Hohagen, Hannes Trautloft, Hans-Joachim Marseille, and Erich Hartmann.<br />I also like that Makos was able to tell the full story without being overly sentimental, which would have made the story go from moving to cloying.<br />All I can say is that you'll LOVE this book.<br /><br />Update: I originally read the Kindle version, but I've already purchased a second Kindle version for a friend (he's still reading it) and two more copies in hardback, one of which I gave to my WWII veteran father-in-law (he loved it), and the other for my mom for Christmas in two weeks; so I think that pretty much says it all about how much I think of this magnificent book.<br />I sincerely believe that this book should be required reading for all high school history classes.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A must read, well done.  Many characters and story lines to keep track of but once you get into the book it truly was a great read. Enjoy
B000VSAEYI|5.0|After reading mixed reviews I still decided to go and get it. My 22 month old absolutely loves it we added some fun balls and with the toys that it comes with it's just great entertainment for her in the afternoons!!! I'm eight months pregnant and I set it up by myself it was a task but I did it so anyone could set it up!!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wow  What an ending!  It leaves you wanting more.  What a fascinating concept.......is a murder gene even a concept, or a reality.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|my daughter loves it so it must be. a good game but I don't like how you have to have a facebook to get past missions
B000FCKIFU|5.0|A very interesting set of characters in a fast paced novel where the outcome is not obvious half way through.<br /><br />Excited and curious how the characters will evolve in the rest of the series and purchased book 2 immediately.<br /><br />A nice balance in providing enough back ground detail, but not so much that you forget what the real story is about.<br /><br />Dan Brown should take some notes!
B001TWT0AE|5.0|We have so many movies with James Stewart in the lead, this has been very good value as with all the previous.
B005HED11Y|4.0|Great social commentary from the mid-60's<br />Original Cast<br />Story-lines that stand the test of time<br />Vintage<br />Very high quality video and audio
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I find this book extremely good. One of the best walking dead books is always the beginning. Can't wait to download another. Yours truly.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I had  to download this to get flash on my kindle fire hd 8.9 and it works great . Happy
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing how some people lived, are still living, as in the Queen of England.  Although Downton Abbey (Highclere Castle) is certainly unique, the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, NC is more luxurious with stone-cut architecture and wooden trim.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I got this game for my son and he is addicted to it and I play it as well and it is very fun and all kinds of obstacles
B009CG9JFU|4.0|I find myself watching this once a year.  The visuals and story are so fresh compared with the current cookie-cutter fare.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Use it everyday no problems...charges fast with the power fast  charger. Also ahs the prongs that bend in very convenient
B009CF3P7E|5.0|Just an absolutely perfect reboot of Star Trek.  The.cast and visuals are simply stunning! Kudos JJ Abrams!  I find myself watching this every year!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|\\"Unfair hair-splitting from minds in vulgar states,THAT's what Bilbo Baggins HATES!! Fault the characters and movie length,say the pace lacks speed and strength!!! Compare it to movies void of imagination,declare it's not for THIS generation!!Mention the lack of blood and gore,exclaim it's just a major BORE!! THAT's what Bilbo Baggins HATES;that the wrath of fools' reviews are heavier than COBALT weights!\\"  \\"Poignant reviews with malicious traits,THAT's what Bilbo Baggins hates,so carefully,carefully speak ya' dire straits!!\\" I was SO very impressed with this TIMELESS tale after viewing only 20 minutes of it from a rented disc which had to be returned ronto!!! This epic tale was actually the FIRST book I'd EVER read,so I was ESTATIC when I heard that the movie WAS definitely going to BE made a while back,and I was NOT disappointed in this adaptation!!! I was  immeasurably DELIGHTED to see the obscure(but personal favorite character in ALL of Middle Earth)\\"Radagast he Brown\\"actually featured herein!!I'd been enthralled with this vaguely explored character ever since Gandalf told shape-shifting,goblin-hunting\\"Beorn\\"that:\\"If you don't know who I am,then maybe you've heard of my good cousin\\"Radagast\\". To which\\"Beorn\\"replied:\\"I used to see him now and again.\\" I almost SHOUTED with delight when he brought forth the gargantuan\\"RHOSGOBEL rabbits\\"to save the day!!! I thought:\\"They even decided to include the name of Radagasts' mysterious dwelling-place reported to stand near the borders of Mirkwood,as well as explore Radagast love of the birds and beasts of Middle Earth!!\\" More\\"jewels\\"were the mention of the dark fortress of\\"Dol Guldur\\"and its evil sorcerer the\\"Necromancer\\"along with the mention of wickedness from way back in the Silmarillions' First Age chronicles:\\"Ungoliant\\"!!! Surely most hadn't even noticed such trivialities which I really appreciated,but this book all but DEFINED my innocent childhood!! I can't WAIT to see the whole movie,but what I HAVE seen thus far has been TREMENDOUS!! The Wood Elves,Dain Inronfoot and the Dwarves of the Iron Hills,the town of Dale etc;made this an ASTONISHING experience for a true Tolkien fan like myself!!Even Thorins' sir-name was(accurately)explained in the IMPRESSIVE depiction of the war of the Orcs and Dwarves which even debuted\\"Bolg\\"and\\"Azog\\"!! The mention of the\\"Stone Giants(which Gandalf lightly quipped about to the travellers in the book during a thunderstorm)\\"tossing boulders at each other was yet ANOTHER nice touch in addition to Gandalf taking of the mysterious,rarely mentioned\\"Blue Wizards\\"(\\"Alatar\\"and\\"Pallando\\")who didn't come back into the West of Middle Earth after journeying into\\"Rhun\\"with treacherous Saruman!!!

B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|I like movies that have drama.  This movie shows the hope and faith in life when there arises challenges that are impossible.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|spent countless hours enjoying this game, until an impossible update forced me to stop &amp; lose all progress. what good is a game update if you cannot actually perform said update?? very unsatisfied.
B0019O6IWU|3.0|I had actually taken a semester-log course on the subject of effective/compassionate/none violent communication. I have not finished the book. It has a lot of helpful information and has raised my insight into the human element behind our communication styles. However, I keep having to put the book down and take a break due to a combination of reasons: 1) I am not a very patient person, and want to get to the meat of the matter faster than the book allows me to. Stressing the points the author is trying to makes will actually help getting the pint and remembering it better, if you are not impatient as I am. 2) The book could use a better editing on use of English language. When I learned English as a second language, I was told to keep my sentences short. I have been frustrated with passages in the book where on sentence runs for several lines. By the time I get to the middle of the sentence, I have lost track of the beginning. This is not easy reading to digest, to begin with. When you add the very long sentences to the pot, it gets frustrating. On the whole, I think the book is well worth reading. The information helps one develop skills in communicating with more compassion and understanding other people. I am participating in a weekly group meeting based on the components of this book, and the combination of the book and the meetings have been very valuable to me. I am already seeing people who &#34;have done me wrong&#34; in a totally different light. In place of the anger and resentments I had felt towards them in the past, I now feel compassion for them. I have been able to forgive them.......something I never, ever thought I r would be able to do. Good luck!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I'm glad a ca&ntilde; play this on my kindle . I'm so happy now I lay In bed at night and play it way to late.
0399157565|4.0|This starts out with references to a paleontological find and you don't know how it's connected till you get to the end of the story. It keeps you riveted.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|GENIOUS just pure GENIOUS! I love thew way the director captured the true essence of the heros, cant wait for the next film.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Fun very entertaining<br />And the game is free<br />Yep best app in kindle store<br /><br />Ham and cheese HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ha haha
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|visually stunning puts it mildly.  And I love that this Blu-Ray version contains extra musings from Peter O'Toole himself.  The prior DVD versions did not contain that extra.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I can't wait for more!  Just the right amount puzzles and finally no list of items to find.  Ready for more levels!  Hope it's soon.
B0021L8V0M|2.0|good action movie except no frontal nudity.  angie kicks ass and does amazing martial art job.  well worth time spent watching.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like it very much it's good to know what the weather is doing at any given time and this app is well worth it
193700788X|5.0|I bought this for my wife, she is an obsessed fan....She recommends it to all<br />I present she will cherish, from me.....
B0061US58C|2.0|Just way overworked and contrived. You can only push cliché so far.<br />My wife went to sleep maybe half way through. I made it maybe 10 minutes more and my 17 year old nephew turned it off shortly after that.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Arugably one of my favorite books of all time Ender's Game kicks ass. At once thought provoking, entertaining and perspective-shifting. Also, the science in it struck me as not bad.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I'm enjoying the book, but I'm only reading half. I have a feeling the action on the show will be worth the wait.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so cute and has amazing sound effects. The boss battles are entertaining and there's so many things wrapped up In one game. Definitely has more potential than Subway Surfers or any of the Temple Run games. The only thing that could be a con is that since there's so much action going on at a time, the screen, especially for phones, will be crowded and hard to navigate. But if you have clever eyes and quick fingers, this shouldn't prove to be a problem. I highly recommend you to download this game. I have had no issues with it so far. A platform running treasure XD
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was in religion class my freshmen year of high school.  I have watched the film many times since.  It's definitely in the conversation of best movies of all time.  If you've never seen it, it's definitely worth a watch.  It takes place in a prison so of course it's not intended to be viewed by people under 17 without an adult there to tell them not to laugh at prison language.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I don't like this because it is in constant need of being reinstalled. It is frustrating to look for it only to have to upload it again on my kindle.
B0094LZY2A|5.0|Saw this movie when I was a teenager. I recently purchased it as a download for my iPad. My 6 & 8 year old girls loved it. They've asked to view it repeatedly.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It works well and wakes me up every time. I believe this is one of the best alarm clock apps out there.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I love this book! It's the most elegantly crafted novel that Austin wrote in my opinion. And the characters voices ring with clarity even after all this time has passed. The absurdity of Mrs. Bennett, the condescension and arrogance of De Bourgh.. Just so well done! And I love the after story letting us know how everyone lived happily ever after! I'm sure Austin was as annoyed as most people are at books without complete endings. I couldn't be happier with her for it! I think I've read this book 5 times and I'm sure I will read it again. If you haven't read it yet - enjoy!
B006QV30JU|4.0|Wholesome and entertaining with music you will be whistling for weeks.  It makes you wish for Brigadoons in real life.
B005HF0GKC|5.0|The family dynamic plays a big role in this series.  I am on my third time watching the entire series.  That last season though, it is hard to watch, I mean it is good, a little too good, lol no spoilers from me!
B004UQPM4E|5.0|I don't really have anything to say about the actual Blu-rays that hasn't already been said.  I'm still leaving this review though because I want to clear up something.  The best way to get these Blu-Rays are to get them through the marketplace and directly contact the seller BEFORE buying to make certain that you are getting the US version.  I did that and I got exactly what I wanted at a great price.  They're NTSC encoded, the box is in English and the discs are all clearly labeled. It's a great box set and it's worth that little bit of extra \\"trouble\\" (if you can call sending out one email \\"trouble\\").
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Different take on slaves life. Never thought about white people being enslaved. Read it rapidly and good read for me
B00B97SNJI|4.0|Taylor has sounded like JB (not THAT JB) all along.  But this time, he channels the voice, the themes, the instrumentation.  Is that David Lindley on slide?  It's a bit earnest, but enjoyable.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I wanted the follow-up to their previous CD and wasn't disappointed at all. The guys are great and extremely gifted!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is the most fun I ever had on my kindle this year I love the creator  of this app.
0547572298|2.0|I'm halfway through this book and I had to put it down. It seems like he wrote this novel in a weeks time. The words just didn't engage me like, for example, Pynchon's in V (which I picked up after Ubik). I'll give another book of PKD's a shot and establish my opinion of his writing at that time.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a great summer beach kind of read.  The characters are likeable and the story heartwarming. I would read it again.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very good read. Not my favorite of Nicholas Sparks books but still very good. Definitely can feel how crazy the husband is.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This is terrible I tried to open it and every time I do it closes the game I know it might look fun but I don't know.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you are on Facebook this is a good app to use.  I did have a little trouble at first navigating the News Feed but finally figured it out.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The movie helped answer many questions my son had about how the team was formed.  It kept his interest throughout the entire movie.  We both can't wait the next one to be released.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like using this app, it allows me to check my e-mails without logging into my computer.  One downfall though is I haven't figured out if I can place emails into folders that I have created.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|Not bad but clearly not as well done as the original series from the BBC. Will watch in a pinch.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app for the Bible.  I can download different translations to my tablet to access off line.  This is nice in places where there is not a WiFi connection.
B005ZMTXMY|5.0|This is a fun movie to watch with the family. My two year old loved the balloons and the talking dogs.
B000UZNSWM|4.0|Excellent book. I was there so it is nice to know what really happened and why. It's sad to realize how much was screwed up and the lives lost because of that
B0064X7FVE|5.0|only problem is that it slows down my tablet, but I blame that on my coby tablet, don't buy that thing. Does not handle ethernet very well, keeps changing connection speed.
B0012GMXYM|5.0|Bought the LP in '74! CD was and still remains mid-fi at best. ALWAYS preferred SIDE-2---ie;cut 7-12. The most sought after songs historically start with 'practice what you preach' through 'borbolletta'...somewhat disapointed that no remaster or SACD version is  yet available. Oh well. Cuts 10,11,12--are STILL among the greatest headphone-crankin' set EVER!  tyvm Carlos!--the mix and artistry is elegant!
B008KP6ENE|1.0|Not much to say, more fun watching paint dry, the old oil based kind with the nice smells! That is it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a very challenging game. I am very intrigue with it. I am still trying to get out of level 5. lol. I would suggest this game to anyone who likes a good challenge.
B00821OX98|5.0|Season 1 started off kinda slow, but it picks up. I'm in season 2 and I love the series. Can't wait to watch Season 3 now.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Had to have the first video of this before my son could see the second movie that is out in theaters now.
B00866JL96|5.0|Everything was great, as usual! Another anxious time waiting, but well worth it. Great chemistry between the two actors. Yummy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is the best game ever my favorite part is the vecter battle and stuff and Bering to fly around
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Another great experience! Great movie.Several people I know have had bad luck with relationships; this movie shows that there is someone out there for everyone! It's a Chick Flick with a manly side to it!!!!!!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Incredible look at North Korean life and the bureaucracy of the North Korean government.  It follows the life if one boy, and the lives of those his path crosses.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|When I saw this movie in the theater I couldn't wait to get it!It arrived when it was supposed to,of course, but not soon enough for an anxious person. Nichlas Sparks is my favorite author; I have read all his books. And so, another reason to be anxious! I could've bought in store, but I would rather give you the bizz. Thanx
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Was a good action packed movie. Story kind of lame, and was looking for just a little bit more. Loved the Die Hard movies, but just didn't feel this one.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|I love this performance so much, that already owning the DVD, now bought the bluray for my new tv.<br /><br />This is the concert that made me a Pink fan. If you are not a fan now, you will be after this concert!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is the show to watch. Action, scare, thrill, drama and love. It has it all!!!!! AMC knows their stuff. I can't wait for Season 4
B00992CF6W|5.0|My daughters love playing this game. Great for building three dimensional thinking skills that are critical for math and science. Plus, it's lots of fun.
1583334386|5.0|we all havae difficulties with will power. This book is an excellent in dealing with the subject. The author cites lots of research to support her conclusions. Very helpful in managing my willpower issues.
B0006J28BO|5.0|My girls love The Cat Returns. It's a wonderful movie with and interesting plot. Not much violence or sexy stuff. I think this film would be interesting for both girls and boys. Plus there's lots to talk about with your kids.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the game!! Great job Solving each room definitely wasn't easy<br />Had to do a lot of brain power and memory use.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was awesome. It kept me thinking the whole time. I would love to sequels to this game. Hope they come soon.
1451627297|5.0|This book is a great surprise.  I've never read a Stephen King book before and I wasn't quite sure what I was getting myself into, however this book keeps you hooked! I haven't wanted to put it down and have had to force myself to go to bed at 2 AM!<br /><br />It's very engaging from the beginning and incredibly entertaining.  The idea of time travel is presented in a fresh new way which makes it stand out from other time travel books and movies from the past.<br /><br />Very cool book - I'd highly recommend it!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|What with all those cable and other services, I buy very few movies, but I had to have this one on disc.  It is one of the few films I can watch over and over and, except for a few harrowing scenes (which are nonethless essential to the story) I enjoy each time.  The story is inspirational, the writing is crisp and the cinematography is superb.  If anyone had told me, before I'd first seen this movie, that a film set in a prison would become one of my all time favorites, I'd have thought them insane, but it is that good.  This addition has so many extra features that I am glad I invested in it.
0307887448|1.0|This book had so many great reviews and it sounded like a lot of fun! I really loved Ender's Game and I thought it may be similar to that.  However, the 80's references are obnoxious and they were out of place.  The author interrupted the storyline to make incredibly long 80's references and it just felt like the author was trying was too hard to bring back the 80's.<br /><br />I might try to finish it one day, but as far as I'm concerned, there are much better books out there that are worth my time!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game it is so fun and it has a mix of temple run and subway surfers it's awesome LOVE it
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|it was fun but it would spawn me off the edge when I died it was better than lep's world.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Did not watch this show on network airing. Watched all 4 seasons on Amazon in an embarrassingly short amount of time. Love it
0345803485|5.0|Delivery time was great, and the condition was as close to new as a new book. It made an appreciated gift that was read by the recipients family and friends as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun and entertaining. Not to mention that it teaches responsibility. It's fun to show friends aswell. I love it.
086571701X|2.0|Found the procedure to be far too complicated for an old person like me, perhaps if I had been brought up on a farm or something it would work more favorably for me. But I must give this book thumbs down. The price was right however, and the delivery was quick.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Well I love this version more than the frist one. I love the mine train. I would tell my friends to buy it.
B000006Y4E|5.0|High N' Dry is Def Leppard's second album which came out back in 1981. It's also one of the few times their sophomore album surpasses their debut. \\"On Through The Night\\" had it's moments and it was a good heavy metal record but it was a bit raw, a bit amateur. Production-wise \\"High N Dry\\" is an improvement and it's a little more polished/refined musically. \\"Bringing On The Heartbreak\\" was their first ballad and their first major hit which shows a more melodic side of the band. Although some people say they weren't heavy metal by this point, it's still there in songs like \\"No No No\\" but it would be almost absent by \\"Pyromania\\" goes more for arena/hard rock. \\"High N' Dry\\" is an early classic which tends to be overlooked but it's as good as \\"Pyromania\\" and I prefer it over \\"Hysteria\\" as well.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|great size if your using it with a smaller grill like mine, the lodge sportsman grill. its all you need.
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica's 4th studio album \\"...And Justice For All\\" is their best record in my opinion. The band came back strong after the death of Cliff Burton in 1986 and their commercial success with \\"Master Of Puppets\\". Many people say that when Cliff died they went downhill. Maybe later on but not here. This is Metallica at their heaviest, darkest and most technical. Their sound matured a lot over the years, they slowly moved away from thrash metal and into progressive. There's still some thrash here but very little compared to \\"Kill 'em All\\" or \\"Ride The Lightning\\". Lyrically it's some of their best and most intelligent songs written. They're based on many subjects like war (Blackened, One), the legal system (Justice For All, Eye Of the Beyholder), paranoia (Shortest Straw) and insanity (Frayed Ends Of Sanity). This is Metallica at their high point and one of the best metal albums of all-time (in my top 10). Musically it was done excellent with complex guitar riffs and solos, drumming was excellent also. One flaw is the stripped down production, it's was very underproduced. Besides that the entire CD's a masterpiece and my personal favorite track is \\"Dyers Eve\\" (saved the best for last).
B002U3CCF6|4.0|It took me a while to get into this book but once I did I really enjoyed it. Gillian has mastered the art of really mucked up characters. She never hides behind niceness. She's brutally honest with her characters which makes you want to read about them even more.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|IT WAS AWESOME....at first but then the next day it would load till the beginning of the video but then it would go right back to the home page... maybe it will load for you but me....NO! bye :)
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|This self titled full album is their heaviest since \\"The Warning\\"... and is now my 2nd favorite Queensrÿche album after \\"The Warning\\"... It was refreshing to hear the high notes again from new vocalist Todd LaTorre... This is what Queensrÿche is supposed to sound like... I hope they continue the same trend moving forward !!!...
B00874T02K|5.0|Get it and work for it.The only thing that will stop a person is there self.Work for it and it will show.Thanks guys for this app I will post again when I go more in to it.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Graphics were good with lots of action'<br />Then Take a Classic Episode combine with a CLASSIC movie mix it up in a blender and call it new?<br />yukkk<br />A dead Tribble with no context and they expect new fans to know what that is.<br />more imagination on Vulcan then what's left in all of Hollywood
B0047WJ12K|4.0|This is the kind of film you put on your list of things to do every five years or so.<br />Unforgettable. The casting is excellent, the script original. Be advised,<br />The action never ceases or your confusion. It helps tremendously<br />If you read many of the online reviews once you've seen it.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|All I can say is watch it now! I am not even a big fan of the fantasy world that much and this show is hands down one of my favorite shows.
B00006RAKP|5.0|this is a good cd i played it in my car songs are great i loved it it brings back memories when elton john sings circle of life and rocket man and benny and the jets the is cd is hard to find best buy does not have this they are out best way to get this cd is on amazon.com
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Best written and acted show ever on TV. Bryan Cranston is amazing, as is the rest of the cast. Awesome!
B004UID2LC|3.0|the app is pretty good, but on half the videos, it says it can't play it. If you want a good you tube app, look for -playtube- it's much better than this app.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|It was so good that I watched the entire 5 seasons in 2 weeks!! So fascinating to see the dynamics to the\\" Family\\". And Jax where do I begin love love love him!!!!!!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Like most of the books from Khaled Hosseini this one was absolutely fantastic! Just loved it!! Definitely worth reading it!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie as a predecessor to the original. Great acting by all but especially the scrubs guy that did the voice over for the monkey.
B001H4NXCK|5.0|Was told not to bother--it's not very good.  Jodi Foster is charming.  What's not to like about James Garner?  Mel Gibson?  Yum.  Mel and Danny Glover?  Excellent. Just excellent.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Started watching this to pass the time in the airport, but now I'm addicted. Great show, very funny and very addicting.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series takes you on a ride of a life time. I would recommend this series to anyone that enjoys a good story!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I was really worried I would not like this movie since I don't really go for the animated/cartoon type.  I have to say I was delighted with this movie. I think the &#34;plot&#34; was perfect for a child.  My grandson and I laughed throughout most of the movie.<br /><br />Loved it,<br />NaNa
0345535421|5.0|Riviting book that is hard to put down.  More descriptive and intense than the HBO series.  A long read that seesm to fly by with the gripping story.  Can't wait to read the remaining volumes.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|My son turned me on to GOT on HBO, love the series!!!  He began explaining the books and I HAD to have them!  Just finished the first book, and on to the second, heading out for vacation and looking forward to reading more and more and more on the beach and by the pool!  MUST READ!
B008O9V4C2|4.0|First three songs are awsome and worth the whole cd. Very nice. Great sound too. The box seems way to cheap.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very entertaining! It's challenging, but not too hard. At first appearance it looks like it's going to be boring, but it's actually really good.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I fell in love with the characters, and the story line... some steamy love scenes in here that makes this book series fun to read again and again.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|It arrived right on time and it was in good condition. It was a good price.<br />Thank you very much.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|I have tried and tried, but for some reason I cannot get it to charge, let alone work.  I am sure it is just me, and when I do figure it out, even reading the directions a dozen times, I know it is something that I am doing wrong.  The controller feels good in my hands, compared to the regular ps3 controller, and I like the off-set toggle switches.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|All songs are real good. Production is top notch, creative and hot.<br /><br />Favorites are the song with Raekwon, &#34;Runaway&#34; and &#34;Turn up the lights&#34; but they are all good and wouldn't think about skipping a single one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved Gillian's writing style.  It depended on the chapter who's side I was on.<br />A great puzzle all the way.
B0001AP12G|5.0|It had great singles, great filler songs and great features.<br /><br />Words don't do this album justice. No point in detailing every song.<br /><br />As with all of Kanye's work it sounds very natural but thought out and organized.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its so fun when you hit the jumpy things and fly<br />and it is not a rip off like the other games
B000002H33|5.0|For years I've thought this was Metallica's peak moment.<br /><br />Another album that cannot be given it's proper credit by some guy's review.<br /><br />I used to gripe about the poor fidelity due to 1986 recording technology but not anymore. The band will most likely never re-master it so there is no point in complaining. Just turn the volume up.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the read. Liked the narrative style. Enjoyed the movie, but not as much as the book. Some thought provoking chapters.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|One movie that we would see again Liam is a great actor and it is always on some sort of thriller suspense.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Maybe I missed the point but I didn't find this book all that engaging.  I wonder what I missed ..the plot?
B001TCNSOI|5.0|This movie has a good thrill and suspense drama thing going on, It was up to a point very sad to know what happen and how it happen.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So glad this season finally came out so I could get caught up!<br />Loved it - anxiously awaiting season 4
B005YPJ62E|4.0|I'm not new to the concepts but enjoyed hearing it in someone else's view...watched the Secret many years ago and as far as I'm concerned anything that helps to get me to a place of feeling better - is always a bonus!
B004GJYR7I|5.0|Hepburn and Grant have a wonderful romp in this classic. Great comedy at its best ~ without even trying. I've had my daughter watch this film, and believe me, I would recommend this to anyone. It is hard not to laugh with Katherine Hepburn.
0375869026|5.0|My 12 year old granddaughter is required to read this book prior to her beginning middle school.  I ordered it for her and started to read it.  I found that I could not put it down ... it is a peek into the world of a child with a physical handicap, how he handles it, and the reactions of his peers.  It covers the humor, the hurtfulness, and ultimately the kindness and acceptance that makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time. A marvelous book, and I just hope she reads it cause I'm not doing the book report for her!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Lots of fun. Not too hard,  not too easy. Wish the game was longer. Will wait for updates.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Great family movie...my 5 yr old nephew and I really enjoyed it....good balance of humor and sensitivity. Would definitely watch again and recommend.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|It's a cute, pointless little time waster with nifty spirograph-like results and several options for changing the appearance as you go (color, thickness, transparency, etc)
B008JFUTT0|5.0|One of the best documentaries I have ever seen. I just love the story, the passion and the talent of Rodriguez.
159463176X|5.0|A fantastic epic read. Could hardly put it down, each character is so fully embraced. Even though the story starts in Afghanistan and moves to Paris and the USA, it is fascinating to watch how the characters are connected and what love and family are all about
B00C4QWDYY|3.0|First season was great I was absolutely captivated, &#34;Very Right Brained&#34;!. Second mix of both left and right brain with a little softening of the zombie effect, 3rd pure hollywood, the acting carried the script.<br /><br />Wishing we the people, could all really get involved in the creative process like &#34;final destination creative&#34;, very techie, Example: Andrea lives or dies alternate per scene options. We need more creativity.<br />Never the less, still quality zombification, and great acting &#34;imho&#34;, thanks!
0800141660|5.0|Great price, great movie, fast delivery, great love story, other movie Jane eyre, north and south, the inn of the sixth happiness.
B00003CXB4|5.0|An all time favorite Disney movie! There's plenty of excitement, humor, and joy your whole family will love while watching The Lion King! It's a classic that you will want to watch time and time again! \\"Be prepared!!\\"
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I enjoy playing and it definitely could be something to get hooked on. The minions are so cute. Gotta be fast tho! Those obstacles show up really quick.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I really like this game, the thing is it wont open anymore please fix this I want to play it again
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its an awesome game, very entertaining!!!!! I live the movie and the minions are my favorite part which makes it even better!!!! I Highly Recommend You Downloading This Game!!!!!!!!!!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|i would have rather rented this for $1 at Redbox, but the others with me that watched it liked it ok.
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|I am a big fan of Bruce Willis but this moving was dark and the only thing good you can say about it was it had a lot of action.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|I'd say good coming of age story but it is almost more than that. This novel delved deeper than the average high school boy would look into their own psyche, yet still allows room for their humor and just overall silliness. It really makes you stop and look at our relationships with others and their impact on and/or insight into our own true secret selves that only come out to play when no one is around to see or judge.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been a si-fi fan since I read Heinlein’s “Tunnel in the Sky” when I was in the 7th grade. Back then, Science Fiction writers were actual scientists. Writing coherently about a plausible future even if it is horrible takes a basic knowledge of all sciences including the human condition. “Wool” was a series that I couldn’t put down. The idea of living in a silo for dozens of generations was both fascinating and horrifying. Not lost on me was the power of “well intentioned” leadership that knows what is best for the people. It could be a metaphor for what many are experiencing today
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is good game. Interesting, keeps your attention, can be quite challenging. One of the better Mahjong games I found out there.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Worked as long as you stay wheat free. Not that easy to do. Travel kills me but at home weight falls off!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This movie showed what can happen in the real world!  I think he should have gotten his job back, basically the little drinks that he had taken probably calmed his nerves to have the guts to do the things he did!  I wouldn't have any hesitation flying with him!  He got the plane down the Best way it could have landed! Now, I'm not saying he should have been extremely intoxicated!  This movie had everything one could want in a movie, extreme drama, thiller, mystery on how it's going to end!  Like it says on the cover, &#34;Powerful&#34;!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is. Mesmerising.  Can't wait for more.  The combination of great acting and a beautiful locale is so far above all other tv.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|THIS WAS A thiller it could have been better!  I just purchased it because Tom Cruise was in it! Some mystery to it!
B003BW0CB6|3.0|I enjoy Michael Connelly's novels &#62; This one was just OK . . .<br />His novels have many unexpected twists &#62; particularly at the end of the story.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|This has got to be thev worst James Bond I ever saw!  Small plot!  You could tell it was low budget!  Hardly any plot!  I've seen every James Bond movie ever made, this was the worst! Now Casino Royal was great, intriging, great plot!  Kept you guessing!  Throw this one away!  Prdictable all the way!  It was even depressing at times!
193700788X|1.0|If you are hoping for a meaningful conclusion to Sookie's adventures, this book isn't it. It appears that author lost her interest in Sookie completely and wrote this nonsense just to appease the readers. very disappointing book
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|So it seems now I can no longer play this game because I can't do the update. Waste of time!!!!<br /><br />Edit- The update is fixed. I can play again. Nothing was deleted. Guess I should have given it another day.
B00821OX98|4.0|I like the way the characters have been put together. I am very interested to see where this one is going.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fell in love with this book from the beginning, can't wait to read the other two....i'm left wanting for more just like Ana....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series is addictive.  Loved every minute of it.  Wish it was longer than 3 books.  Great Summer Read for the beach.
B00CATSONE|5.0|It is an inspiring book to read. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is intrigued by their imagination.<br /><br />Tesla will always be one of the greatest that ever lived.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Not my favorite book, but I will keep searching.  Just depends on the readers individual taste on non fiction books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|WOW I'm surprised that the app is not at all like the movie I don't know when the app came out if it came out around the first or second movie so I don't actually know and at one part it basically is just subway wider besides that it's a great app
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series is addictive.  Loved every minute of it.  Wish it was longer than 3 books.  Great Summer Read for the beach.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|I've always loved this classic movie, and I have five kids (three boys and two girls) all between the ages of 11 to 15 and they all thought it was an awesome movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series is addictive.  Loved every minute of it.  Wish it was longer than 3 books.  Great Summer Read for the beach.
B00932A4XE|5.0|I'm way past babies of my own and this brought back some fun memories of that stage of life, however dramatized it was.  I'm particularly fond of Rebel Wilson and Elizabeth Banks in this one. And the baby scene with Jennifer Lopez makes me cry every time I watch it.
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|Priest sounds as good as they did 30 years ago! Its a great dvd to bad KK not with the band but new guy is good. Must buy for metal heads
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is really fun and challenging but not too challenging to give up I recommend you get it and it's free so why not?!
B001E75QH0|1.0|I received the set and when I started to play the first disk, &#34;raiders of the lost ark&#34; it rattled and would not play. I ordered a separate single &#34;Raiders of the lost ark&#34; when it came it froze up after 20 minutes. I am really disappointed. The return policy is so complicated it is useless for old people.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Great movie that makes you think... what if...kept me interested to the end. When parts of the move got slow it would pick right back up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like that there are multiple items to find before escaping. You have  to find color,  number,  shape combos. Find clues,  pictures and keys to escape.  Short and free,  so I can't complain but I would like more!  Please?
B00AYB16EO|5.0|A classic.  If you haven't seen it, you just have to watch it.  It's one of those movies that you quote a lot.  Of course its pretty stupid and the storyline is awful, but that's not really what we're watching it for, is it?
B000ID37RM|5.0|No matter how many times we watch this, it's a thought provoking and wonderful movie.  Fairly close to the book,<br />and well acted!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This is better than 100 floors write down number solve puzzles. You will like this game from the first floor to the next one.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|in a retirement home for geriatric opera singers, comes Ms. Redgrave a former diva. Her life changed and for the better when she settles in and meets up with old friends and a former love.  The dialouge is wonderful and the humor is just right. Of course most quality movies, such as this one, come from Britian and with British actors.<br />The cast is stellar and the movie was such fun. I look forward to stumbling upon others like this.
B00003CXA6|5.0|We just finished watching the second disc. We have just returned from a trip to Gettysburg for the 150th anniversary so the events were very much on our minds. It was really nice to be able to see how well they followed the events in the movie and it made it that much more enjoyable since we had just been there. I now think I will read the book it was based on (had not done that) before watching the movie.
B004A8ZWVK|2.0|I tried to read this book and made it only about 50 pages. It was so depressing to me and somewhat mean spirited. haveing grown up in the 50's and 60's in my town, we didn't see this type of behavior towards those working for us and others, but then we didn't have maids full time.<br />the time period i will admit was harsh and many harbored ill will and hatred for other races at that time and still do today.<br />It is a shame that so many think it a good movie. while there were fine actors in it, the story line is one that to me, should not be applauded for any reason.  it was so serious and race problems still are. i am not so sure this would be a good way to handle it.<br />this is merely my opinion.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I play this on my kindle and mytouch. Its fun and you rarely have to purchase gems. just play and increase levels.
0553801473|5.0|Great book in a great series.  I bought this because I was tired of waiting and having the paper back release date pushed back.  Now if only Mr. Martin would finish book 6.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This looks so awesome but for some reason it just doesn't seem to work or able to download funny :l
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Be sure to plant and grow several plants of the same kind before moving on.  You'll soon learn which plants produce more algae than others. veryaddictive.
159463176X|2.0|How do you really get attached to the main character of a story if the author continuously keeps skipping on to another person who in the end has minimal impact on the story?  The story is strong but the side roads definitely detracted from the important details of the plot.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|This is a light read when you're in the mood for something both funny and smart.  The short stand alone chapters are great if you need reading that you can pick up and put down.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this it has inspired me to exercise daily. I am getting stronger every day.  It is nice to be on the right path.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun game...please put out more for this one...not too hard and not too easy...I loved it! looking forward to more!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it awesome I love the movies cant wait for number two<br />have fun playing and watch out for the bombs
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a great thing for engineering and wise for spending money. Honestly this game is great.  It fills you with amazanation and wonder.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|I chose this rating as I think this is Hosseini's best effort yet. His previous books were also excellent but I loved the rich tapestry of the culture, which was so beautifully written.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|A must read for anybody interested in humanity. Frankl's case for \\"tragic optimism\\" provides a valid and useful tool for anyone to use in navigating the difficult waters of our modern, globally oriented  societies.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|Beautifully written, it made me laught, it made me cry and this is a book that every parent could relate to and empathise and rejoice in.
0307476073|5.0|I loved this book.  A first-hand account of a very brave and determined woman's journey to find herself under extremely difficult conditions.  Her accomplishment gave the reader confidence:  if she could do this, then maybe I can do something extraordinarily challenging and be the better for it.  I would compare this book to Expecting Adam by Martha Beck, another story of a woman's triumph over poor odds.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|When I first downloaded it for my kindle fire it was fine until they changed it now I can't read it.
0385361661|4.0|First things first, I absolutely adored Wedding Night. There are so many mixed reviews about this book, and I will be honest to say I was hesitant to start it because of the negative reviews I had read. I saw so many references to how this was nothing like Kinsella's previous books, how they couldn't stand one or both of the characters, and was just overall disappointed.<br /><br />I don't understand these negative reviews at all. Was this different than previous Kinsella books? Yes. But that in no way made it rubbish. I loved the alternating point of view, and I ended up loving both Lottie and Fliss. I laughed out loud so many times, and the Kinsella storytelling was still quite evident.<br /><br />\\"If Muhammad won't come to the mountain, the mountain has to cancel all his plans and get on a plane.\\"<br /><br />Lottie. She was so adorable. She wanted so much to be married to Richard and when that went down the drain she jumped at the chance to marry Ben, even though they had not seen each other for ages. I didn't take offence to the traumas she had to go through on her honeymoon at the hands of her sister Fliss. I thought they were quite funny. Even though I knew she was feeling miserable, we all knew it was going to work out in the end.<br /><br />\\"My great moment of triumph ... It's all turned to dust. I wasn't the heroine of the hour. I was the thoughtless, stupid villain.\\"<br /><br />Fliss. I think because Lottie's name appears first in the synopsis, a lot of people assume that this is her story. I also think that is why a lot of people say they didn't like Fliss, because she took up a lot of the story. I don't think this is Lottie's story at all. This is a moment in both of their lives where one event has turned into a life changing moment for them both. I loved Fliss. Were the actions that she took to prevent Lottie and Ben from 'putting the sausage in the cupcake' extreme? Absolutely yes.. but they were hilarious. I can't even caught how many times I laughed out loud. And seeing as how I listened to the audiobook, and a lot of times I was at lunch at work... I had quite a few people looking my way.<br /><br />\\"You can't switch sides!\\" I glare at him in fury.<br /><br />\\"I was never on your side,\\" retorts Lorcan. \\"Your side is the nutty side.\\"<br /><br />I also loved the side characters, Richard and Lorcan. I had to warm up to Richard at first, but once I saw how much he truly cared for Lottie it was easy to love him. And Lorcan? I fell in love with him. His own story touched my heart, and I adored his interactions with Noah, Fliss' son. It was a joy to watch him and Fliss move closer together as the story went on. Ben was just a tool for most of the book, and I think my dislike for him is what helped me find the tormented honeymoon so darn funny.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this book to any Chick Lit fan, as mentioned before it is different from other Kinsella books but it is still really great. You will laugh, that is guaranteed.<br /><br />\\"You fall in and out of love, but when you really love someone...it's forever.\\"<br /><br />This is my first review for an audiobook version. I used to be a member of Audible years ago when I had to commute a fair distance to work. Now that I no longer have that commute I never really found myself with much time to listen to them. But I decided that when I was doing such things as cleaning, showering and sometimes at lunch at work, instead of listening to music it would be better to be 'reading' a book.<br /><br />So, I am a proud renewed member of Audible and will always have one audiobook on the go, on the side of my normal Kindle reading. It took me about three weeks to get through these 13 hours, but the story flowed nicely and I never found myself lost when I went to restart my listening. I loved the narrators Finty Williams and Beth Chalmers. They were easy to listen to and I enjoyed the way they altered their voice when speaking for a male character. So as far as theaudible version is concerned, I give two big thumbs up.<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Readsaudible version is concerned, I give two big thumbs up.<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Reads
B008XG1X18|5.0|Anything to do with home and garden is here.  If you 're a dyier you are in for a lot of ideas.  Some easier than others but certainly projects for all levels.  From thing to make to kid projects this is a go to sight.
B00CEJ2H6K|3.0|To those who know Amon Amarth and have listened to them before; you probably know what to expect. Guttural vocals, thumping double bass and various guitar trills throughout the songs. The lyrical theme of Vikings and Valhalla have not changed, (As if they ever would,) so you can safely assume this album to be at the very least, solid.<br /><br />And that's all it is.<br /><br />I'm not sure what it is, but as some other reviewers have pointed out, it doesn't have that \\"epic\\" feel to it that their previous albums did. Surtur Rising was better, imo. Deceiver of the Gods is by no means bad, it just doesn't have any real standout tracks, Other than the title track.<br /><br />The sound seems kinda \\"flat\\" to me. As if it doesn't have a whole lot of dynamics to it. Which is weird, because Surtur Rising didn't have this problem and it's an older album.<br /><br />Whatever it is, this album doesn't do it for me. Amon Amarth will always be one of my favorite melodeath bands, but this album I won't listen to very much.<br /><br />Final verdict: Three stars, and not a single one more.<br /><br />And now let the butthurt downvotes commence.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app is fun to play and everything, but after a day mine stopped working if you wanna have fun with this app for a day you can but it might stop working after about a day
B0064X7FVE|1.0|All old reviews should be wiped clean and let the new ones since the recent update ring loud and clear. This app went from a 5 star to 0 star in one fell swoop of a crappy update. Uninstalled after over a year of happy use.
B008476HBM|5.0|I have read this before but still love the story and the characters. It still is my favourite Jane Austin novel
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is an absorbing book that succeeds in creating an entire world after some disaster has made life on earth impossible. The survivors have built a kind of civilization in underground silos stretching hundreds of floors beneath the earth. Their only view of the outside is through windows on the top floor which get clouded over by dust and pollution. Every so often, some criminal is condemned, or someone volunteers, to go outside to clean these windows. It is a death sentence. They have protective suits that allows them to do the cleaning -- but then their air runs out and they die.<br /><br />This long saga introduces us to several characters whose actions form a kind of prologue before we meet the real protagonist, an engineer called Juliette. As our view of this world widens, we learn more about how it came into being. Unfortunately I did feel the book lost steam toward the end when we get into conspiracy theories and rebellions. At this point, the focus is less on the strange society which has grown up in the silo and more of a conventional story of conflict.<br /><br />Still, this is a virtuoso performance by an author who has convincingly imagined and created an entire society and made it seem persuasive and possible.
1407130366|5.0|The package took a little bit of time to receive but for the quality it was worth the wait and price.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|the story was good, however I can't tell you how disappointed I was to find that the story didn't come to an end.  I waited months for the final chapter.  Then at the end, NOT EVEN AN EXPLAINATION!!!  NO INFORMATION WHATSOEVER.  I had to go on her web page to even find out what was up.  Now I have to wait for God knows how long for TWO more books.  I am not sure I will bother.  It is really a shame.  She had a great story going.  VERY SAD!!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I had really looked forward to the 'last' book in the trilogy. To my disappointment, the plot wasn't straightforward. I thought the series would end with this book.<br />Another twist came up, which was that someone knew Gideon killed Eva's stepbrother. I still think it should have been concluded in this book.<br />Eva's parents also having an affair is another twist that was totally addressed by the author.<br />They still have their insecurities to worry about, which I think is ok, but by now should have been addressed.<br />In all, I liked the new twists but still think the plot shouldn't be this drawn out.
0425252868|5.0|My father was stationed in England, and was a radio operator on a B17. I found this book so enlightening.<br />After years of stories about the war, it was incredible to read these first person accounts.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in WWII.
B006ATJXQW|2.0|When I finished the maze runner series I still had a lot of holes I wanted filled. This book was interesting but it doesn't mention anyone we know until the end. I feel like their needs to be one more book between this and the maze runner!
B009NY43NY|4.0|Though not her typical Sookie story, I still enjoyed the book for what it was and sad the story came to an end.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I enjoyed the story and the challenge. I am looking forward to the second part. I hope I do not have to wait very long.
B00AS1Q93S|2.0|I have read the books on Jack Reacher. Tom is too small and not near as mean and yet witty as the character described in the books. I for one was disappointed.
B0053FANS6|5.0|Love the Mummy Movies.. they are great.  When I had the opportunity to purchase the trilogy, I jumped on it.  3rd is probably my least fav.. 1st and 2nd were very very good though.
B00A8MGIZG|3.0|Well - I had to watch this movie twice to catch onto an on to the whole story, sequences and etc, but it was an interesting concept.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love the game but after the first time I stopped playing the it gets to like the illuminate thing and then It force closes... help
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|I've listened to this album for 3 weeks, so I think I've given it enough time to write a review. I have to say, this is really a great all around album. It doesn't have massive hits and Layne isn't here anymore, but I think track 1-12 this could be AIC's best overall. Other AIC albums, there was always songs I skipped because I found them either didn't really go anywhere, or were too depressing. The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, I can listen front to back without skipping a track.<br /><br />Hollow and Stone are the stand out tracks, but I think Pretty Down is just as good. Voices, Breath on a Window, and Scalpel deserve a mention too.<br /><br />I think TDPDH and Black Gives Way to Blue has proved Jerry Cantrell is one of the best musicians of this generation. Sometimes I find he gets overlooked.<br /><br />Anyone one who gave up after a couple listens is missing out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome.  It's the best game I have ever played I absolutely love it. I love horses. They are one of my favorite animals .
B003BW0CB6|5.0|It was interesting from the first chapter and I was sorry when it ended.  The series was good and this was the best.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|One of Waynes more memerbible western roles, my father and I love this movie and have watched a lot as i grew up. Fun movie to kill time with.
B00932DCS8|4.0|Great movie if you don't have any expectations.  I just saw the rating and turned it on, turned out to be a pleasant surprise with couple of twists.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This is a great series by Lauren Oliver. I really enjoyed reading through it and found it hard to put down.
B00932A4XE|3.0|Was a good movie with these ladies it is impossible to make a bad movie.<br />It was just a little too much adult content for mixed company and a teenager in the room.<br />Lots of cursing
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The characters were great. A person could really feel what the characters felt through the story.  It kept my interest through the story and it just got better as the story went on. I would recommend.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|It was quite nice to view the movie and listen to the soundtrack.  The cinematography was quite well done and the music was excellent quality.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Game is much fun.  Speedy and addicting. I play every day to get daily bonus.  Swipe method was not fun on kindle.  Gyro is way to go.
B004LROMWU|5.0|Am enjoying this series, something I haven't seen before and makes up for the reruns during the summer. Would recommend this to family and friends who are sci-fi buffs like me.
B002HL3PN4|4.0|Just introduced this to my 5 year old. Getting him hooked already, planning to read the first book next. So fun.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|it took over 30minutes for it to download, then when I tried to open it it took another 20 minutes for the game to load. now it keeps exiting in the middle of the game!<br /><br />but the game is fun when it loads.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great television.  I only wish we could claim it as great American tv.  Perhaps we will and make it even better than the British version as we did with The Office.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The app won't open in my Galaxy SIII and I'm not sure why. As it's showing the credits or loading screen it just closes without warning. No error message, nothing. The Play Store version does not have this problem, so if you have a crasing issue then try there.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Surprisingly romantic!  My new favorite!  I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen a truly heartfelt movie in a while.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had not seen any of the three series. Now with Netflix - Season 1, Huluplus- Season 2 and Amazon- Season 3, I am up to date. Loved every minute.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|At first it was easy.. then it got a little challenging!! definatly adficting!! Fun app overall. I recommend it and cant wait for the update and more challenging levels!!
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|For their second album, this is AWESOME!  Every song is a hit and so fun to listen to.  This is probably why they mopped up at the country music award shows.
B00ACP3OOM|3.0|Vine UK review. I'll admit to being sceptical about using underwater MP3 players due to sensory issues of wearing the headphones on the jaw/temple rather than ears, it's turned-out not for me because it's just too uncomfortable and with the added discomfort of lack of sound consistency when going from underwater to out of water just makes it no good for me - for a avid swimmer who doesn't mind the unusual feeling of extra weight on the back of your goggles or the feel of the 'headphones' on your jaw they'd be fine, again it's just not for me and not a problem with the device itself per say. In general the sound is great when under the water, this device also holds an impressive amount of music which is great, and it's easy to use - one major negative is that the wires to the 'headphones' seem very flimsy, given the awkward length and how awkward it is to store the player I imagine the wires getting broken far too easily. I'd like to have seen some sort of holding case or bag as it's a bit awkward to carry round in your bag, especially with wet gear.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I didn't really know much or listen to Eric Church before his album Chief.  Once I got that, I had to have more!!  This album is no exception.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was such a fascinating read! So suspensful as well. I even read it when it was time to eat! In my case, that is rare.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is definitely one of the better free games I've downloaded. The picture is great, it gives you all sorts of different levels to play, and the overall experience is fun! It's not too easy and just the right amount of challenge in my opinion, and I really like it :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Straightforward calculator app, intuitive interface. I like the fact that it saves your most recent calculation until the next time you use it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's fun playing this game. You have levels challenges and more get this game now and I promise you you won't regret it. Temple run 1/2 get free
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a fun free app. cant help but love the minions.<br />great for keeping kids busy and husband too
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Downloaded this app. last night on it my kindle and played it. it was great, and I loved it. this morning I go to play it and it wont work. what ever update was done need to be undone quickly. ill improve my rating when I can play the game again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its not super hard, but it entertaining. only has 10 levels though so they need to add more of them.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I've always loved reading Neil Gaiman's novels and this is no different. It takes you it another world and you'll become enthralled with this novel. A page turner and I loved it!
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Friends recommended this show to me so I started catching up on it thru Amazon, and I'm hooked! Great action and storylines, and i love superheroes.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I was reluctant to see this in the theater, because I normally don't like pre-quils.  However, this one was the best!  Even though the Wizard of Oz is a very old movie, Oz played into it perfectly.  I found that it brought sense to many aspects of the old movie, and it was fun fitting all the pieces together.  I knew after I saw it in the theater, that I would buy it to keep.
B00080DIWE|5.0|It was all I expected. I've been using it for about a month and holds parts and the model great.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved the crossover series.  I hope to read more Gideon &  Ava.<br />Very entertaining.  Couldn't put the book down. :)
B0064MGU98|5.0|I missed the first three years on TV.  I'm so glad I am able to watch them all on Amazon Prime.
0143034901|5.0|Read book to prepare for trip to Spain.  It is rich and a great read. I would highly recommend it.
B00DU74U74|2.0|It's a one-man-show, like Tom Hanks in Castaway, and she's not Tom Hanks...  I haven't read the book- maybe that changes things.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Starts off really well and gets you wondering what you yourself would do. Even had several conversations along this theme. Sad to say I started to get bored half way through so haven't finished it yet. Will go back to it on a winter afternoon when curled up on the sofa with nothing better to do.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is awesome it helps to exercise the mind.  Please hurry and create some more I keep playing the same ones over &amp; over.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|When I first watched this movie I wasn't planning on liking it let alone loving it! The amazing details and artistry that went into making this movie still amazes me every time I watch it over again. The story is pretty simple but its cute and they tell it really well. I'm just disappointed I didn't see it in theaters first.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The minions remind me of my pesky little brothers. They always run around the hous  pretending that they have fake machines. Rhis is my favorite game so far !!!!!-!!-
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I've always thought magic on a kindle would be great and it is. A little bit stingy when you try swiping cards but still pretty good.
0140042520|5.0|The Dharma Bums is fantastic and a critical read for anybody interested hiking, Buddhism or just general soul searching!  Read it, enjoy it then read it again!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found this game by accident.  Love it. You have to think.  You use your eyes and your brain. Have fun!
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Great Scottish movie for kids. Not a terribly inaccurate portrayal of the culture of the time period either. Does involve some violence, discussions of marriage, magic, and family disputes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We have had so much fun playing this game! The levels keep getting more challenging and addictive as you progress further along!
1451620829|4.0|Peter did a great job in a tell all book.  Some things as a fan I really didn't need or even want to know but I'll give him credit for his honesty.  I didn't find the Catman to be whining at all.  He has legitimate complaints from his former band mates.  Over the years we have been bombarded with the Gene Paul spin on Kiss fact or fiction.  Peter full on admits his drug use and accepts responsibility and as I read it had no problems with the original split up.  The reunion he has a great deal to complain about.  Yes, at that point he was a hired gun. At the same time Gene and Paul complain about his playing or him wanting more money...as far as Peter's playing he was playing fine saw two shows....or I should say he as playing no better or WORSE than Gene or Paul, before they start complaining they need to look in the mirror. For some reason they seem to see themselves as great players or frontmen, which is really not the case. As far as more money, Yeah both Ace and Peter deserved more, Gene and Paul act like they \\"rescued\\" Peter and Ace....well yeah those big shows they were doing of 2000 people (tops) was really amazing...point is its a two way street.<br /><br />Peter's \\"complaints\\" are well deserved and documented.  In the end the true fans know the truth and that is that Kiss is long over they are now nothing more than a cover band, to use Peter's very accurate description...when you have people acting and dressing like the original members its just became a cover band.....Thank you Peter for your version of the events its about time people get to hear that side.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Kinda gruesome in parts but wow, what an awesome movie. One of those with the trick endings that you just have to watch several times over and have all the \\"aha!\\" moments. Love it!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|After I saw the first season I was dying to see the next one.<br />And this was completely worth it as it was not just as good as the last one but even BETTER<br />The quality was perfect and I loved how I could download it and watch it on my computer anytime I want now<br />Perfect and amazing. Love it
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game and play it every day but now I can not get it please help I play it on kindle fire
0988178532|5.0|What a ride! A fantastic read that's fast, easy, and fun. I read a lot of  sci-fi/fantasy and found Outview to be much, much better than I had hoped for. My only warning is to make sure you don't have anything too pressing to get done before you begin...it's hard to put down. Do yourself a favor and start this one on a Friday evening when you'll have the time to KEEP READING. Looking forward to Outer, and already dreading the end of the series. Thanks for the awakening Brandt Legg, I see great things to come.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It's a great game I love it, but it crashes a lot now. I can't even play it anymore. But good game for all ages!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I read books across the spectrum, fiction, non-fiction, historical, spiritual. This one was recommended to me and I found it to be the most profound book I have ever read. I will continue to refer to it as well as recommend it to others. It takes an open mind to grasp the concepts as real, but I was already open to the ideas as I have studied A Course in Miracles for many years. It validates that as well as other spiritual concepts. LOVE IT!!!!
0060591714|5.0|This one completes a wonderful trilogy. It was intended for children but it caught my imagination and made it soar.
0525478817|5.0|This is such a good book, full of engaging conversations and the real problems of teenagers battling cancer. Hazel's terminal diagnosis is kept at bay with an experimental drug. Augustine is in the survivor category, and he brings love and laughter Hazel never thought she'd find. Their devotion to Hazel's favorite book leads them on a trip to the Netherlands to meet the author. While the ending may appear to be determined by the beginning, the book has a poignant and unexpected ending. This is a book I'll read over and over to enjoy every moment of it again.
B000053VJI|5.0|I had lost this CD many years ago and I am loving the memories this music brought back into my life.
1781162646|5.0|Joyland is a sweet coming of age story with a hint of the paranormal. Stephen King creates the carnival atmosphere of the small town amusement park so vividly, I feel as though I've been there. This isn't a book with scary mayhem and gore, just a great story of a young man coming into his own and the people he meets one summer.
B00AB7IA1S|3.0|Once you figure out how to play the game the levels are easy to beat and if you ask for help it shows you exactly where to put the fans
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is wonderfully produced. Beautiful art, many options for play, and a great interface. Highly recommended for beginners and veterans alike.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Does what it was made for.  Easy to use with no negatives.  Wish the unit would charge faster but that isn't the fault of the cable.
B001IF252C|5.0|It did just what it was suppose to do and it's still working. We use it in our recording studio and being able to run dual monitors for the mac mini helps.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Just what my kids wanted, we watched together, and enjoy every minute of it, just waiting to be able of buying a Blu-ray-digital version.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|I bought product and liked everything about it. I expected more durability and for the battery life to be longer
B00005JLEU|5.0|We have it in VHS, I have no idea how many times my daughter has seen this movie, one of her favorites, and she is already 20 yrs old.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Trying to find movies my husband and I both like is always a challenge as our taste is so different. When I saw the previews for Red 2, I went looking for Red since we had never seen it. It was listed at Amazon for a very reasonable price and we really enjoyed it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey it's  beautifully well made, everything looks perfect in time to me,  scenery , hair stiles, clothes, carriages, I enjoy it very much.
B008602KQI|5.0|I don't usually like this type of movie. I like movies that are more realistic of our time. However, the execution of this movie was very good. The story line keeps you engaged and the acting makes you feel for the characters. Also made me want to get back into archery!
B00129H7VS|5.0|I been trying to fine this on blu ray for awhile. Great price and watched it as soon as it arrived.
B000ID3E9S|5.0|This movie has been one of my favorites for a long time. The plot is interesting and the acting is well done.
B009O5CLZY|4.0|Lots of fun, but I quickly accomplished all the tasks/achievements and cannot unlock the next levels without buying them for 20, 000 gold coins each. That leaves me with the option to play for an insane amount of time to save up the few dozen you get each round, or buy them. My advice is this: play the game, if you REALLY enjoy it, invest in the $2 coin doubler early on. It's free and fun, but the chains are over priced, and there isn't much left for me to do, so I hardly play it anymore. I wish it were just a $1-$2 app where ALL the levels/achievements/ranks unlocked with game progression. All in all, a solid 4 star game.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Am still reading it, but all indications are it is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. Am flying to Italy tomorrow and plan on finish in on the plane.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is one of the best games I have found I can't stop playing it it does suck when I run out of money do
B007BVOEPI|4.0|The &#34;Thrones&#34; books are a great read and I would recommend both the books and the TV series to anyone with an interest in medieval/fantasy style fiction. I enjoyed the fact that the story is allowed to be presented on its own merits, without million dollar special effects or over-glamourized hollywood style makeup, costumes, backdrops...etc. That being said, I was disappointed that the plot strays from the book, and in some cases it is a blatantly obvious attempt to add shock value with flagrant nudity and sex scenes. Don't misunderstand me. I am an adult and I am not offended by nudity or sex. It is only the addition of such scenes when they do not follow the original storyline that I find disappointing. All things considered, I would recommend this series, but I would suggest reading the book/s first.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Liked it even as a little older person than target audience. Look forward to the next in series and to read the ending.

Caption Picard is ausom<br />Blue ray helps bring out the picture in 90 percent .. 10 percent little fuzzy<br />Thank you for your time  Shawn g
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game, its amazing. But I just wish there was a way to change your skins on this! I try over and over with these youtube videos for it but I see the comments for pocket tool ones, they say it stops it from working. If any one finds a way to do it please tell me how to.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|A great love story. A heartfelt read. Dawson was someone you could fall in love with immediately. His love was undeniably abundant.  I cried at the ending a little shocking for me.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I love this series. I was team Maxon all the way but some of the behavior was just out of character. Maxon was a very sweet guy with good intentions but now he just got down right confusing. I understand how he is dealing with all this for her but if he expects her to be completely honest shouldn't he be as well? But even though I had issues with some of this it was still a great book I couldn't put down. Heck I bought it today and just finished. Can't wait for the next book!
0316044695|5.0|This book contained an amazing story. It started a little slow but that is perfectly okay with me, lots of books from this genre start with training stories and backgrounds of personnel involved and such. Once I finished reading the entire book (cover to cover) I had to just sit and stare at the cover for a minute and seriously think about everything described in the novel. It's all absolutely incredible. It wasn't as exciting and page turning as say, \\"No Easy Day\\" but it's a different setting and scenario all together. Once the book got to the portion where they were in contact, it was extremely hard for me to put the book down. I lost many hours of sleep just because I couldn't stop reading the book before I went to bed.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who's interested in this type of genre. This book is one of the best, if not the best book I have ever read.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|This movie is so nostalgic. I love it :) The purchase was great and quick! everything was intact and in time just as the description said. Thanks for a wonderful purchase experience.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. Romance and mystery wrapped in a whimsical setting that makes you come alive and sets off a spark in you.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|I enjoyed the knowledge I gained about N. Korea. I was not immediately drawn into the reading; however, the story became somewhat of a page-turner mid-way through. There are redundancies which contributed to my taking longer than usual to finish reading the book. I kind of expected how the lives of the characters would unfold because the same or similar hardships were faced by most of the individuals whose lives were followed.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is probably in my top 3 favorite cds....being a musician myself I REALLY do<br />appreciate the inspiration, and work Josh Groban puts into every single song.....<br />HANDS DOWN, every song on this cd will &#34;lift you up&#34;.....so inspiring!!
B00DGN51O8|3.0|I hadn't watched a good PG-13 movie in awhile and this was a nice action/adventure without the cussing and nudity that is normally in this genre.  Aside from that, the graphics were up to par and the acting was good. The plot had some twists and turns to create excitement though they were predictable.  The story line was an interesting adaptation of the typical Jack and the Beanstalk story. The only thing I feel the story lacked was more focus on the giants and how to slay them rather than just the 'human' character drama.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh Groban (as usual) performs splendidly......beautiful voice, great selection of songs..<br />this is a must have for anyone who is looking for a &#34;Classic Josh Groban&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I got really excited when I saw this game so I downloaded it on my kindle fire and too find out it doesn't work, I would not recommend it
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|We had this on VHS and wanted it on DVD. Fun for all ages. Good clean entertaining fun! Never heard anyone say they do not like this movie!
0736063684|5.0|I got this book years back. Still its in great 'new' state. I have been through my PT degree with this and now my career as a PT with this. This book has been my bible for all this long and I recommend this to anyone interested in PT or going through a PT career! Very useful!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions and I like temple run and this is the perfect combination of both. If you are a temple run fan and a minion fan then get this game.
0307200477|5.0|This book was given to my son when he was born 50 years ago. We read it for hours and hours. It has become a family tradition to give this book to the grandchildren, nieces and nephews ... an introduction to reading using sight, smell, texture .. how perfect!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I've had the pleasure of reading many books about the early Presidents and this book truly demonstrates the cunning thoughts and articulate wording used by Mr. Lincoln to assemble a team of his rivals and persuade them to his side for the betterment of the country and not their own agenda.  What I loved about the book was the review of the telegrams, letters and notes, then the author provided the back story behind the real meaning, and then would explain why Mr. Lincoln used specific words in this response to keep his team together.  Even being fired by Mr. Lincoln made you feel like you were still the best man for the job as you packed up your desk for the last day.  I enjoyed this book from cover to cover and there wasn't a dry reading spot throughout the book.  Details of the battlefields were limited and the book really focused on how he brought all these rivals together to build a team that's sole purpose was to win the war and re-unite the country.  It also showed how Mr. Lincoln controlled appointment positions to maintain Republican power within the government.  An absolute must read!  I enjoyed the book so much, I then checked out the CD audio version from the local library and listened to it while driving to and from work.  Well worth every minute!
B0076DELIG|1.0|I ordered this book inadvertently, however, I don't think it is my kind of book so I cannot rate it
B00932AA5G|5.0|They tied everything up, and I mean every single plot point that could have been a loose end. It took a while for me to want to give it a chance but I am very glad that I did. Absolutely excellent. Headhunters is definitely in my top five favourite movies.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|this game is the worst. every time I try to play it it just goes straight back to the &quot;home&quot;. this is really obnoxious. I have tried everything to fix it but it still doesn't work!!
0073398101|5.0|Well written and comprehensive review of basic fluid dynamics.  Excellent examples and illustrations.  Makes a good supplement to current journal articles and computer-based software applications.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|I started playing PC fps way back when Wolfenstein came out.  The original.  Having been playing with a keyboard and mouse for years made it nearly impossible for me to play fps on consoles.  I hadn't used my PS3 in years because of the frustration!  Enter the Eagle Eye.  Changed EVERYTHING.  I love this thing.  I can play my PS3 games with my keyboard and mouse seamlessly!  If you're on the fence, then as a long time PC gamer I highly recommend this product.  I love it!
B003L0T5R0|5.0|PERFECTO!!!! Bride was very very happy!!! She's a huge fan and thanked me several times for meeting her music request. :-)
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This movie keeps you interested from the beginning.  It draws you in as all the characters are developed well and the actors/actresses are amazing.  It has it sparks of humor and filled with adventure and drama.  What I really enjoyed about the movie was the different aspect of relationships that the dwarfs have with each other, Bilbo, Gandalf, and the elves.  There is so much depth in each character.  Can't wait for the second part (there are three movies just in case you didn't know) that is coming out this December.
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I liked this version, it's a good adaptation of the story.  Got a big kick out of seeing Johnny Lee (Sherlock on Elementary) as Knightley.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Lavinia and Belle, what sweet characters.<br />Their stories are so heart felt. The way women were treated, even though this is a novel is so unbelievable, yet true.of course all the slaves.........<br />I've always understood the terrible sad a history of African Americans.its so hard to believe people could be so ignorant to ther fellow men.<br />A must read.
B00130UFY2|3.0|Sure it's entertaining. But not nearly as much as the first Bourne. The spy drama stuff takes a back seat here to routine Hollywood action movie sequences. Lots and lots of car chases. Fist fights where the cuts are so fast you can't see what's happening so there's no real tension. Bourne runs, someone chases him. Sometimes he is chasing. Forgettable music accompanies these scenes.<br /><br />(I mean really, do you think Bourne is going to lose a fight with an agent sent to kill him? No. So why drag the blows on and on and on.)<br /><br />Matt Damon is fantastic, and all the acting is first-rate. It's too bad we don't get to see more of it.<br /><br />Having said that, of course if you like the other Bourne movies you have to watch this one.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|this was a good game from what little I got to play. they should tell you up front that it is a trial and not a full game. if they would have told me that I wouldntnhave down loaded it because 4.99 is a steep price food a game.
074401493X|3.0|The presentation is very good, sober hardcover art and title embossed with high quality. Just do not say it's great because inside this quality is not maintained, with a median quality printing, just look the images of gameplay to notice this, pale and faded colors. The weight of the paper should be better for limited edition. Lacked inspiration in the design and poor layout. In short, It's not a beautiful guide to see, does not fill up the reader's eyes.<br /><br />Contents: starting with the keychain which simulates the medal of fireflies - superb! A unique piece for collectors, extremely well done and adds the value of the acquisition. Handling an idealized object on screen is rewarding.<br /><br />The guide itself - my impression was of disappointment. I think the producers participation in this type of material makes a big difference, which did not happen here. The guide is so simple it borders on naivety, there are no secrets, bonuses, interviews, artworks and precious tips to the player. There is nothing special you have not already seen in the game. The chapters are basically the ingame tutorial, just printed. To be considered an indispensable guide it needs to go beyond that. Example, the first chapter talks about the game mechanics, items, collectibles. What is a bomb of nails, a molotov cocktail, a health kit? What is the reason I want to read about something I already know playing the game, so obvious is that information? Using cover, such as climbing at high points, swimming, are examples of mediocrity content. And that extends to the chapter about the multiplayer. The only useful thing indeed is the second chapter, the walkthrough, to help you find the collectibles. And here is the only importance of this guide, only helps player to find the collectibles that are likely to be few since The Last of Us is a game to play often and often, and problably you found such collectibles without the guide.<br /><br />For you who want something more about The Lastof Us I recommend not wasting time with this guide, it has value only by the FireFly keychain. Seek \\"The Art of The Last of Us\\", this done by the producers themselves and full of comments, texts and excelent images that will expand your experience about the game.out something I already know playing the game, so obvious is that information?

B000G0O5N2|5.0|As our rights continue to erode, as our freedoms as Americans slowly slip away, as our economy continues to disintegrate, as our jobs continue to disappear like mine did, and as our democracy continues to take a hard left turn towards socialism, I see a movie like this one and for one split second I see how truly great the men and women of our military are until I snap back to reality.<br /> But what a waste of American lives in this film.<br /> I can't understand why we are constantly trying to save the poor African's all the time. If they want to kill one another let them, They kill one another here in the U S.A. all the time for instance the Crypts and the Bloods for the most ridiculous of reasons, east west coast rap, blue red doo rags, territorial disputes over their own neighborhoods etc.<br /> They apparently don't care about one another here and they don't want us there in Africa and don't appreciate the sacrifices our military which  by the way is made up of all races has made for them.<br />This scenario seems to happen  somewhere on that continent over and over again but we just can't leave them to their own devices.<br />Appartied's over in Africa and I've read that crime is worse than ever now.<br /> I can't even watch the news anymore here because I know I'm being fed with nothing but lies on any channel I watch and that includes Fox which is more honest than most, they all lie and have an agenda that their trying to shove down our throats and I'm choking and becoming skeptical of all of them now. Talk show's like \\"The View\\" and many others do the same thing.<br /> If you want to feel proud of at least The United States military for awhile watch this Ridley Scott film, just stay away from the propaganda they call news, and buy as many guns as you can before they come and take them away, that's what Adolf did first once he came into power and I see that happening here NOW!<br />The best days of The United States of America have long since gone by, it'sbeen a slow, painful downward slide and the rides over. This decline started with the hippie 60's generation, I grew up in the 70's and I finally became politically aware of what was happening in the 80's.<br />U.S.A - R.I.P.<br />Hail Odin!!!!!!!!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I really enjoyed the weather channel app up until the complete overhaul that was recently introduced.  The app has now become too complex, all I wanted  was to be able to see the forecast , current temp, and radar.  Sometimes it's best to not fix something that wasn't broken. App removed.
B00406UK5A|4.0|It's a mediocre film at best, but all  the actors in it are excellent.<br />I enjoy seeing the Roman empire getting it's ass kicked, they basically enslaved everyone they conquered but they couldn't conquer the primitive tribes of Britain which the Romans considered to be the end of the world.<br /> The Vikings didn't seem to have any problem doing this when they first started raiding England and by that time Britain was way more civilized and advanced, but I digress.<br /> Also, if your a Walking Dead fan like me \\"the Governors\\" in this movie, also the always hot looking Olga Kurylenko is in it though she don't say a single word through the entire movie, she's the most frightening character in the film.<br /> I think it's worth the money and it has a better than average story. Check it out if you want.<br />Hail Odin!!!!!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|An amazing book, would recommend to all kids and parents and adults alike. The last part, with the graduation speeches, gave me goosebumps. It's amazing how the author was able to speak for so many different characters. So many great quotes from this novel. Only takes you a day to read and well worth it. If you like this, also check out A Dog's Purpose.
B0087DFIOU|5.0|This guy writes, directs, acts, produces great movies and I'm not interested in his personal politics or problems, I'm only interested in the money I spend on Amazon and that I get what I pay for, and this movie was funny and action packed.<br /> I'm not going to type 6 paragraphs about what this movies about like the other moron reviews I read on this site cause I like keeping my reviews short, sweet and brutally honest, also I don't want to ruin the movie by giving away spoilers.<br /> Mel Gibson hardly ever makes a bad movie and that's his job, so if he don't like a certain race or type of people, that his prerogative, and that's what the USA used to be about once upon a time. It's called freedom of thought, remember that? To believe in what you want  to believe in without some socialist freak pulling your gun out of you hands and telling you what you can and can't think.<br />My suggestion is to buy this movie, watch it while cleaning one of your many guns and while your having a couple of strong drinks, and have a good laugh while we are still allowed to.<br /> This is truly the decline of western civilization, Right now in 2013.<br />Hail Odin!!!!!!!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I agree with Dr7up! I installed the weather channel app in May 2012 when I purchased my kindle-fire.  I have enjoyed the former app for 1yr&amp;1mth. I checked the We Ch 2 days ago &amp; found that the app has changed for the WORST!!!!!! The new app is not User friendly &amp; is not as informative.  In addition I do not wish to view a weather video. Needless to say I HAVE UNINSTALLED THE APP!!!! Annie1949
B00821PCJS|5.0|If you enjoy SciFi, you'll love this show! Acting is first rate, and special effects are beyond what I expected for a cable tv series.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This series is tremendous!  Always wait for the next installment.  Hopefully Preston & Child continue this series for a long time.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|It is good and my son likes it but it is so hard to get enough &#34;coins&#34; to buy things, I need to buy it with real money and I don't like that
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I played the movie for about 45 minutes then it continually stopped and had to be restarted every 30 seconds until I finally gave up.  Got ripped off!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|My child spends so much fun time on this app. She really loves it and I do too! I recommend it for little girls
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|Hard to follow not what I expected.  With stars such as these you should be able to expect a better story
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I love he game, but sometimes I need to buy with real money in order to get ahead a level
B003B02O0A|5.0|This was the first John Grisham book I read.  After reading his bio I realized this is also his favorite.  I can see why.  It has action, some historical fiction (days of segregation, racism, etc.), romance and legal drama.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|Have you ever read a book and experienced the overwhelming temptation to skip the the end of the book (Don't do it!!) just to see how it ends? Well, that describes my impression of this book. I am a devoted fan of Ken Follett, having read many of his novels. This one, in my opinion, ranks among his best. The way he keeps the reader on the edge of his (her) seat is quite interesting. I strongly recommend that you read this book. You won't be able to put it down.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I chose this rating because the book deserves it. The book was full of suspense, I loved it! It's so different from any other book that I have read. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the Percy Jackson series.
B000WLNZX6|5.0|I couldn't live without this album.  You must listen to the way BB King interacts with other musical legends to appreciate this amazing collection.
0765325950|5.0|For the last 15 years or so, I've been a fan of the WoT series and  those books got under my skin. While the end was a bit sudden, it was nevertheless great reading - as always.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|It was the first time I really like this one. But you have to get the real thing. Love It
B008OOYALE|3.0|It was free but too slow for me..took too long to save up 'money' to expand etc.  Cute dragons tho!
B005SHTXN0|5.0|top acting. realistic plot. some things in the story are predictable but I  still wanted to see what was about to happen.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a great game its better than temple run 2 and subway surfers it works fine on kindle fire and I recommend this game for all ages.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|The story is so complicated yet still very organized and interesting. Good and fun film to watch. Good time killer
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|This was my favorite second country music CD that I brought. I really like this band called \\"Lady Antebellum\\". This is my favorite CD called \\"Golden\\" by Lady Antebellum. My favorite song on this CD is \\"Get to Me\\" and \\"Goodbye Town\\" and \\"Nothin' Like the First Time\\". Most of the other songs fall a little short to me. The country sounding songs on this album have more than an immature pop sound, like in \\"Downtown\\" and \\"It Ain't Pretty\\". And some of the songs just fall flat, like they were thrown on the album for the heck of it. I'm sure many people will love every song on this CD. I hope you like this band, just like I did too.
034580404X|5.0|I remember hearing everyone talking about this series, but I did not want to give in to the hype. I finally caved and became obsessed! The \\"first time\\" I read the entire series in a matter of 3 days. After that, I lost count of how many times I've read this incredible love story between Christian and Ana.
B0079HLDCQ|3.0|This is my first Baldacci book. It is a good yarn. However I do find characters lack the depth or conviction that writers like Graham Greene, Len Deighton and LeCarre deftly bring to the spy genre. I read both American and British page turners and I do find Grisham at his best, very good; and Tom Clancy near unreadable due to cant and writing style. I have read and hugely enjoyed writers as different as Tom Wolfe and Cormac McCarthy. I state these preferences up front so you know my perspective. I hesitate to be too bold commenting on Baldacci on the basis of one book. However on finishing a very good plot line I put the book down feeling I had just finished a Bruce Willis movie. Which is good from the point of view of drama, but not so good from the point of credible characterisation. But with a good story line how important is the character as long as you can happily identify with him?<br /><br />The story of the freelance assassin caught in an obscure web of conspiracy to ensure his downfall, is well told at a good pace. I shall look forward to reading another of his works.
B000RO0ONW|4.0|This is a good package of 3 classic games. It's a must for people who already own Portal 2 and just can't get enough. We enjoyed to the end!
B009EAO38C|4.0|My first experience with the piano guys.  I like it and will buy more.  Their interpretations are creative and pleasing to the ear.  I've enjoyed listening.
B008Y73940|4.0|It was a good movie but the ending was a bit predictable. All-in-all, an enjoyable movie to watch with popcorn on the couch.
0425252868|4.0|I wanted to like this more than I did.  The combat/chivalry incident was almost tangential to the rest of the story.  These guys are all heroes but I would have liked more of how the incident affected the crew in the American plane at the time of the incident.
B004QSQMKE|2.0|My first hint that something was wrong was when the wrapper said made in Mexico. The music was different was my second hint and the movie seemed longer, things were added in this version and the things I loved as a kid were missing. I was horrified by the ending on this edition, it wasnt the same and the music was different too. When I watched it with my daughter I was so disappointed that she didnt get the same excitement out of it that I did at her age. Also the scene where Lilly dances with the dark dressed figure had different music and really that music made that scene, this one was just awkward. I hope to find my childhood original cause this version was just a flop. Had to update this review. The one I ordered was the Directors Cut.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|The cover did fit perfectly however it was cheap looking....it served the purpose until I am able to upgrade to a leather cover...
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|he does a fabulous job of explaining the history of  the study of weight gain. then he explains why so many of us gained so much weight. then he explains how we can get rid of the excess pounds we are carrying around.  then he gives an easy to follow plan for the future.
B00785P2QC|3.0|It has really bad graphics and sometimes it's hard to save up. Also keep in mind that the only reason people left all these reviews is because there is a quest that if you leave a review you get 5 special moneys. Over all, it is pretty fun.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Although this is an historical novel it is still based on what happened to these young children at the turn of the 20th century.  Until I read it I had no idea this even happened and then to find these orphans were treated so badly was very sad and an eye opener.  Of course in the book at least one did end up with a caring family but who knows how many others did.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved reading darkness more than the first one. Couldn't wait to see what happened to the couple and their family next
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|I gave this a good rating because the book was easy reading and interesting.  It took awhile to get used to the English writing at first, but then it was truly enjoyable.
B003UBTX72|4.0|I really enjoy how this is written, its as if your speaking to the man, the myth. It's a gift to get an insight to someone so talented and intriguing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very addicting to play! I wanted to keep passing each level. It worked as a great breaktime activity from homework. Looking forward to the new levels to come!
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love pinterest i is an awesome way to stayonthe beat and find some new things to try i highly recomend it.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|I am not a big fan of the 'road trip' type movie.  Only in a few cases where the characters are very unique (I.E. &#34;To Wong Foo&#34;, &#34;Little Miss Sunshine&#34;) and you know the story will have something interesting.<br />Although the basics of the film are pretty canned Hollywood, you just cannot get better than how Streisand works a character.  She is absolutely at her best when she is doing comedy.  She makes the characters complex.  Rogan was also wonderful in his angst with his mother, their relationship, and his feelings of being told what to do with his business.  All in all a great ride with some authentic character acting showing depth.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|If you like games like this one, you will enjoy this one.  My wife and daughter like playing this game.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|The film felt forced and that it was relying on the special effects.  I did not finish it so perhaps my review is not of value to most, but the fact I did not finish it, does say something about the writing and Mr. Franko's ability to keep me interested.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the book. It was well written and very informative about life and conflict in Afghanistan.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read a novel that also gives insight to true historical events.
0061801313|5.0|I have read the first four books 4 times and each time its surprising and amazing.I had some family issue come up and got off track for actually a few years having books 5-8 sitting on my bookshelf never touched. I started from the first book reading them again and in one week I have read the first four books! I am completely obsessed. I love the show, but it does not compare to the books, if anything I think the show downplays the books. I do agree that they aren't really for the tween audience but they are so good, you don't even pay attention to the small sex scenes in the story. You are too busy trying to figure out who \\"A\\" is. I would definitely recommend to anyone.
B005KELW26|5.0|It was a gift for a 10 yr. old girl, who loves it!!  She is an avid ready and loves the books plus everything else it does!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Lots of twists and turns. I enjoyed the history that the author brought to life along with very interesting characters. Well done.
B00BW0QC8G|5.0|What a quality product - attention to detail, well padded, spacious & versatile... with a small footprint.<br /><br />Unlike offerings from Targus or Swiss Gear, the Case Logic has padding & insulation more akin to what you'd find on an Osprey backpack. Everything from the shoulder straps to the back which allows for a bit of air flow between your back and the pack.<br /><br />If I need to tow a change of clothes for the day or overnight, I don't want to have to lug two bags just to have my laptop. This bag will fit my laptop and even a change of clothes & shoes. I've used it on day trips, hiking, overnighters.<br /><br />There's a safety pouch on the back where you can stow valuables like your passport, instead of carrying them in an outer pocket.<br /><br />The two zipping pockets on the side also have a mesh catch so you can stow your water bottles within easy reach, or zip up items you need easy access to. They thought of everything.<br /><br />There's a large, sturdy loop at the bottom of the bag for jackets or wet gear.<br /><br />...and of course the pockets. So many pockets of differing sizes. Easy access, hidden, expandable.<br /><br />Like any other computer bag, it holds your laptop. However, Case Logic added design elements that make this a wonderful bag for overnight trips, day trips or hiking - the extra padding, zipping water bottle side pockets, space provided between your back and the bag, external loop, variety & flexibility of pockets and the light weight.<br /><br />You get a lot flexibility, quality & space for your money, in a small footprint. I love this bag.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it. I couldn't put the book down. Already have book two in my Que and ready to read.
B004023ACE|5.0|we are constantly getting comments about these shoes and how so many people like them.  They are great shoes. they fit just right and seem comfortable on my daughters feet.  she doesn't like to wear socks and they don't cut into her feet which I like.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|won't work starts to loss and then goes back to my home screen. very annoying I was excited to use it. oh well.
1582701709|1.0|Real life takes real work and positive thinking is just one component to it. That's really it. Most everyone knows being positive is good for you but to promote it like it's the answer to life is irresponsible, unethical, and immoral. This book basically means that all you need to do is to be positive and we'll all be multimillionaires and no one will ever die. I don't think so. It's fantasy thinking, bubble talk, and says we just live in our heads. Which we don't. Life is very complicated and to say how great your life is going to be by just being positive - the law of attraction etc. is just too simplistic. We all want that but real life does not work that way and we all actually understand that on a gut level but the quick fix is always going to show up and this book is it. If this book helped you great but it should not be promoted like it's this great revelation and answer to life which it is not. Like I said it's just one of many components to life. And lets be honest, if the author was being honest they would state all this that it's not magic etc. but is something that may be able to help you and she hopes that it will. That's all you can really say with something like this.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|i enjoyed  reading it, though it was different from mitch albom's other books, but it was very interesting to read.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|This was a story with a unique twist. With both sympathetic and unsympathetic characters, good and evil, beauty and ugliness, this book clearly expresses the moral of the story. While I admit that I started to skim over some of the lengthy descriptions, I was vastly impressed with the wealth of knowledge shown by the author. I am inclined to learn more about the life of Oscar Wilde.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I really love the graphics in this game. I would definitely recommend this.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|If you like other movies in this genre then you will like this one. I give it four stars because the plot is pretty much the same in all these movies of course
B0064MPXFA|5.0|...and we love it. Excellent story and cast. We've enjoyed every episode, which is rare in a series. looking forward to watching Season 2.
B00BMKDTNC|3.0|When a FINAL book is expanded into THREE lengthy tomes, this is the result. LOTS of mind-numbing filler with short sections of revealing story-line. Many of what should have been stunning twists and revelations were hum-drum filler... to justify (it failed) the length.<br /><br />Overall, the good evened-out the bad. A considerable disappointment, especially after all the years that I invested. Regrettably, I saw this coming with Sanderson's first two &#34;collaborations.&#34; It was like he'd run out of gas and the rich detail that I (we?) had come to love and expect was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon.<br /><br />OK is NOT the way this series was supposed to end.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I feels it earns this rating cause it's just so awesome, I recommend it to any gamer or streamer. Phantoml0rd!!
B009RH9J7W|4.0|I like the case a lot.  The only thing I don't like is my Kindle doesn't want to stay locked in when I use the Kindle in the horizontal position.
B0097C8XL0|3.0|this game is fun in all but it takes forever to download. it took more than 24 hours to download. i had to download it like 5times and it still.took.a long time. i dont really recommend it.
B00000IMYA|4.0|The same day I heard a cut from this album on a college radio station, I researched the album and purchased it.  I even ordered a copy for my ex-husband!  That's an example of how good this album is.  It's real music for serious jazz lovers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I was not blown away, but I must say that I really enjoyed this game and how the levels steadily get more difficult!
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I got this because the kindle camera doesn't have the photo timer function, and I thought it might be nice to have a camcorder as well.<br /><br />While the photo timer did work, the photos the camera takes are seemingly worse than just using the built-in camera. Also the picture I took was in the portrait layout, and when I went to look at it in my photos it was rotated on its side in landscape format. I thought I might try to fiddle with the settings and after playing with the exposure settings, got it to look a little better on the screen. So I lined up my face within the image and took a picture. This time, once again, I was taking a portrait image, but this time instead of rotating the image to make it landscape, the image was just oddly cropped to be landscape, thus removing the top of my head and my chin, even though everything looked fine before I took the picture.<br /><br />As far as the camcorder goes, it might be fine, if it didn't crash the app every time I tried to open it.<br /><br />Long story short, I never wanted to be one of those people who gets duped, but this app has made one of me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is entertaining and hilarious. I love the storyline in the beginning and the meena and vecter battles. 5 STARS!
B00CZXIVNI|5.0|This album is really outstanding, Big Time Rush is very talented and this album features songs written by the boys themselves.<br />24/7 is an upbeat party track that is extremely catchy<br />Like Nobodys Around written by James Maslow himself features a feel good vibe to it and makes you wanna dance around the room<br />Confetti Falling is my favorite song on the album its magical really It has Awesome pop beats and really captures that moment when you in love and you feel like sparks fly and confettis falling down. Give it a listen<br /><br />Go Out And Buy This Album you wont regret it!!!
B007TK77QE|5.0|Harsh reality not wizard fantasy but just as engaging and involving amazing characterisation and creation of a discrete world. Powerfully written.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The first 3 floors were too easy. After finding all the clues on the 4th floor, I couldn't use them. Not sure if the game locked up or if I have to buy the full version.  ???
B00CATSONE|5.0|I've read this book twice, you can't knock the price since it's free.  It's concise, probably too much so, but if you want a short story on Tesla this is as good as it gets
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this app! I love playing solitaire on the computer and during my free time with a deck of cards so I got this app. the graphics are good and its the same thing. I think you should try it.
B00371QQ0M|2.0|Some scenes were so dark you couldn't see what was happening. We have the original VHS tape and thought blue ray would be a significant improvement in quality but were disappointed.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Excellent read!<br />Highly recommend for anyone who is looking for a book that is non stop packed with suspense.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|can't get enough of the series so we bought it and can now watch it over and over. BUY IT!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game for kids, there is a whole lot of things to read, so I would recommend 7 and up.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|can't get enough of the series so we bought it and can now watch it over and over. BUY IT!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I loved this book.  Lee child kept the suspense going throughout the book. Finally should be the new chief. I would recommend this book to any mystery readers.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|It is now one of my very top favorites.  I love this game and play it for hours each day.  I have no problems with it on my Kindle Fire so far.  The only feedback I would like to give the developer is that I can find no way to view my results other than getting out of the game and back in, but maybe I'm just missing something obvious.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This story is very entretening. Love the characters and the plot. I can't wait for the next one to come out!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun! I have played temple run, but this is so much more entertaining. You can totally connect with this game since you have already fell in love with the movie. Fantastic!!!!!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This started out as a predictable thriller - the familiar tale of a man suspected for the dissappearance of his wife, and the story of their marriage. The first part of the book is quite engaging but the secon part is the one that turns the whole story around. Very well written, although I found some of the story lines in the second part somehow unbelievable.
B00BTHWFBK|2.0|Rick Rubin is the most overrated banal  producer in rock music today. What a farce,.......after listening to this CD over 40 times, there is absolutely no redeeming quality to the music except for Toni's wonderful guitar tone and Ooze's surprisingly intact vocals. The lyrics, rhythm, drums and bass all reflect the first Sabbath records........but are nowhere near the level of genius of those albums. Rick Rubin is the absolute example of \\"the emperor\\" he makes a fortune because of long past achievements with absolutely no effort or creativity. We wish Toni well in his fight against cancer and miss Dio desperately.<br /><br />God bless,
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love this show.  I had been DVRing it for a while and had about 6 of them in queue.  I finally started watching them from earliest to more current, and had to go find the pilot on Amazon so I could see how it started.  The show reminds me quite a bit of The Mentalist, albeit a bit darker.  The main character is dry, quirky and funny ... like Patrick Jane.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is fun for every one everyone loves despicable me its so fun the minons get to do lots of things
B00AESN8XY|1.0|played this on my brothers phone and tablet and they are free but what's the differents with the kindle fire if it was free I might give it full stars
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent cast, incredible story line development.  You either love or hate the characters, there isn't much in between. And of course the venue...Downton is spectacular!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I'm a Mom and I work at 3:00 in the morning, this app is fantastic for those crazy nights when I can't get my brain to calm down.  Really soothes me and helps me relax.
B003WUYOQ6|3.0|Well researched but scary for a person diagnosed with a heart issue. First my doctor told me to check out Neal Barnard's book about a plant-based diet, complete with carbs. Then the same doctor recommended I check out this book. Diametrically opposed. Where to go from here?
B003OUXECE|5.0|I read this before I played the games which made the games even more immersive for me because I could recognize the characters! Makes you feel for Andrew Ryan and gives insight to the creation of Rapture!
B00BGICGJ8|3.0|Funny and great acting!  Story is pretty good. The oldest girl was a bit too foul-mouthed I think for her age and coming from a nice family. Didn't buy that, but the rest was not that far off.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|This was my first Jo Nesbo novel and I liked it. I liked this authhor'd use of words to describe the characters and action. The story line was well thought out , but the endiing was a bit of a reach. I wish authors would start with the ending and then build the story around it. This was a good, light read. Nothing special. Happy beach days to all.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 was by far my favorite! Definitely worth the money and the only place I could find it was Amazon Instant Video!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best written and acted programs on TV. I wouldn't miss an episode. Very happy to give it a A+ or 5+ stars.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I'm so glad i took a chance on this author. Honestly, this is one of the best books i've ever read!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I got this app as soon as I could for my Fire and I use it daily, or I did,  it just updated the other day and now it is hard to use and the big ad blocks the bottom of the forecast /current conditions screen. it looks odd because it is completely different and seems to have less info.<br />Another thing they did is make it very hsrd to chrck places I lived before,  the old app had them all on one page and I could switch between them with one click. Now just finding them is such a chore that I actually gave up. I will uninstal this crap as soon as I can find a replacement!
B005M5PENG|5.0|Love this series!  I watch the eps while walking on my treadmill.  Enjoying Hawaiian scenery is so better than just listening to music!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is a great series and we are ready to order Season II.  Each chapter just gets better and better.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Lots of character's and action. Fast read one that you don't want to put down. Grisham at his very best.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|interesting plot and ending. Liked interactions of different familiesi  LEGAL aspects and interactions with lawyers and families. Liked genetic and DNa connections.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I love this game!  It's really works your mind and if you love to solve puzzles, this one's for you.  My only criticism would be if you get stuck, the program offers no assistance.  Although it provides you clues, you can still run into a problem and not be able to move on with the game.  I've resorted to using the Internet and checking various blogs and sites that do provide further guidance...although you may need to research various sites as some are better than others.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Hubby is not a huge fan, but he's even found himself getting into it now that we've watched all three seasons together.  Great acting, good plot twists, except maybe the end of this season.  Quite odd and almost forced change to the program.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This series is top notch.  Clare Danes performance is so compelling that you never tire of watching her; Damien Lewis is excellent. Just a marvelously entertaining and thought provoking look into the world in which we find  ourselves<br />thrust.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I was suprised at how much I liked this movie.  Kinda thought it would be another Lord of the Rings, which it is kinda, but I liked it!
B000056HOZ|5.0|He's a legend and to have a collection of all of his songs is great. I can't say anything negative about this item, I'm just glad that I bought it.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Clear as day is a great CD featuring an up and coming country star.  If you love country you will love this CD
0385344333|5.0|Another great Jack Reacher novel. A typical Lee Childs book,non - stop action and hard to put down. I'm in the process of reading all seventeen Jack Reacher books, and this one ranks right at the top. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|A too slow British comedy. They need to get things moving a lot quicker to hold my interest, and I would say most viewers would agree.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I was at level 35, had every dinosaur available, and after updating today it seems the game has reset itself. I am back to square one with the tutorial, etc.  Tried restarting multiple times, but my park is gone. Goodbye dinosaurs, you were fun while you lasted. Disappointed. I am just glad I didn't waste any real money on this game or I would be really upset!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Love this game, don't have a DS anymore so I'm glad I can play it. Def worth the money for it.
1451648537|4.0|After reading the Steve Jobs story, I realize what a genius he really was; not necessarily on the technical side, but more on how to use people that are smarter than you to create a reality for your vision. I admire the man even thought he did not have the warmest personality. We all benefitted from him being here on Earth for his short time.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Great book, I read the series in the printed order. Ender's Game &#62; Speaker for the Dead &#62; Xenocide &#62; Children of the Mind<br />That is, I will read them in order as soon as read Children of the mind. Amazing series so far!
0385349947|5.0|Sheryl Sandberg is an amazing woman and demonstrates how we CAN have or DO it all. We need to set priorities and not take our value as business leaders and professional for granted. I really enjoyed this book.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|My big knock on this game though is that it is just too short. I wish the sealed play was much longer.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Story was phenomenal! I felt that there were still missing pieces though. Some things were left unfinished. Ending was slight disappointment.
B002WSASIC|5.0|Loved this movie!  Kept me engaged all the way. The actors were awesome. I would totally recommend this movie to all!
B00A0MJA1I|1.0|I dropped a pretty penny on this this movie and would expect that the seller be considerate enough to package it properly. Well, they didn't. The bottom corner of the movie box is crushed and the photo in the sleeve is VERY noticeably wrinkled and damaged on both the front and back.It is so wrinkly that it looks like it has been dipped in water. I know it did not rain on the package at all to cause the movie to get wet, as the postal packaging is crisp and undamaged. I have never been so disappointed in a seller as I am now. I have opened the movie and looked at the discs as well, and they look scratched. They are SUPPOSED to be new and I don't believe at all that they are. It honestly looks like I bought a used copy of the movie when I know for a fact that I did not. I would not have bothered to spend that much on this movie if I would have known how damaged my copy would be.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is great to play with a group of friends (that being said it sucks that you can't play with just two people). It takes a bit of time to learn the rules, but once you get it its a lot of fun. Its nice having an alternative to the usual games like Monopoly or Pictionary.
B0074ALZ7Q|4.0|How can anyone who is a reader not remember, or know, the first line of this wonderful book' Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again'!<br /><br />A fascinating woman, Daphne Du Maurier, who has written a book that you cannot put down. Not written in today's style but involving a woman of an era where the husband is the stronger of a married couple and women were more afraid of standing out or standing up for unusual ideas. It's funny, interesting that you never learn the present wife's name even though she is writing the story.<br /><br />She is a shy, young woman who meets a much older man who's wife has just died. They marry quickly and return to his glorious house 'Manderley'. This is where she learns the story Rebecca, his previous wife, and how she died. She is younger than any of his friends and has never had to socialize or run a house that size with many servants. The housekeeper is one of the main characters and you soon learn she doesn't like the present mistress.<br /><br />Definitely read this book.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Have read all his books ... they are fiction, but could actually happen.  I love the reality of his writing and as a hopeless romantic, they make believe that love can be found no matter what!
B00B2DSK06|5.0|The story is so great I love the animation. I look forward to sharing tis with my grand children! K
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|This is the slowest, most boring, non sequential , predictable trash that I've suffered through. My wife doesn't agree, but she picked this looser.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This is a great case at a great price!! It looks awesome on an Iphone 4s! It isn't too bulky like other cases can be. I hate having a case on my phone but I do need the protection, I feel that this case would provide good enough protection as long as you are not throwing your phone around all the time! This case is so sleek that I don't mind it at all.
B00006JSS8|5.0|We heard a Stevie song on TV and wanted to buy it. This was an excellent value and we had no idea how many of his songs we remembered from hearing our parents play them.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game because it is challenging, but not to ha<br />rd. The game also looks great. This game isn't just for anybody. You have to like to think.
630463949X|3.0|Please take a good look at Stevie Nicks in The Dance.  In The Dance, she is beautiful, emotional, engaged with the audience, & PRESENT! Now watch Live in Boston and/or subsequent videos.  Of course, some years have gone by. But-Stevie is detached, uninterested, going through the motions; she doesn't make eye contact with audience- she doesn't care. And not one hair ever is out of place.  She looks like a Stepford wife.  To educated, observant, thoughtful, long-time, & dedicated fans, this is ALARMING!!!  Where is Stevie???  Is this a robot???
B0055B7IPE|5.0|EXCELLENT MOVIE.....GREAT CHARACHTERS, LOVED IT...<br />ANIMATION WAS SUPERB....VERY COLORFUL....GREAT FOR ADULTS AND KIDS ALIKE<br />I WILL WATCH THIS MOVIE AGAIN
B004HO6I4M|5.0|We loved this movie and we are adults...colorful, happy and endearing. I plan to give the movie to kids I know...
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|best fps I have played on a mobile device in a long time. if you like tf2 this is a game for you.
B001N9ESQ4|2.0|Both characters, while easy on the eyes, were just plain annoying, and the improvisational dialogue didn't help. I kept waiting for the film to \\"really begin\\" but it never did, right up until the end. The premise that the male lead would be a noted novelist on a 12 city European tour was unconvincing right from the start. And there were far fewer shots of Paris than it would have taken to make up for the lack of story.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love the story, the English Eriquett, the plot and the quality of acting not to mention the Customes and the dinning experience.
0920236251|5.0|A great story about a strong princess who goes to rescue her prince. My kids both love this book, and it's a joy to read to them.
B009UZBLSG|4.0|This is the official one that has been around the longest since the Nexus 4's debut, or soon after. As I believe others have already stated, even when powered externally, the charge hovers, as far as I can tell. Would have been nice to actually get a positive charge while in use. Overall though, it delivers what it advertised.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook for android is not very stable generally if you do a lot of comments, likes and have a rich news feed. For kindle it keeps hanging at a much higher rate.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I recommended that u should buy this game<br />It is fun and  able to build what ever you want. Buy this game buy the game now
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It works for what it's intended to. Wish it had more operations. Also touch is not very responsive and doesn't flip with rotation.
B00B2EWNWG|1.0|This movie was really bad, and by bad I mean this movie defines the word itself. The experience was painful. I couldn't even watch until the very end because I realized I'd just wasted 1 hour of my life.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Interesting piece of writing, particularly for those who want to learn about how an unstable person thinks. A bit depressing, though
9500426404|5.0|A beautiful book everybody must read. It was a present for my mother in law.She was so excited and happy when she saw this beautiful book.
0307595579|5.0|Being that the book is translated some of the reading is difficult. You may have to reread a paragraph or sentence from time to time. However, the storyline is great.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I am the kind of person who needs to get drawn into a book early on for it to keep my interest. I will be honest and say the first half of this book didn't draw me in. It took me a long time to read it because I was \\"bored\\" with it. However, a friend told me it was worth reading, so I kept going when I would normally give up. I'm so glad I did! The last 80 pages drew me in and I couldn't put it down! Great story, although predictable.
141694740X|5.0|Straightforward and to the point, this book cuts out any guesswork on men's behavior while dating. It's a great go to book that I continue to pick up and read for reminders. And it's hilarious.
B004WJRF6C|4.0|This record shows how great it would be if it was another Beatles album.<br />Don't get me wrong. McCartney does a great job, playing all the instruments and writing all the stuff.<br />But this record sounds like an incomplete work.<br />Some songs sounds like he was waiting for Lennon to finish them up.<br />You could see that already in the latter records from the Beatles, that some songs were never worked out to the end, and was just recorded as such just to get them out and move on,  once John and Paul stopped to collaborate on each other's song.<br />This record has a lot of this songs, that sounds like Paul just wanted them recorded to get rid of them and move on.<br />But the result is good and the few finished songs are worth the price alone.
B00881VLCE|3.0|The way the program works is great but there are not enough free puzzles for my liking. I did them all in one night!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|At first it worked and I thought it was a great app but all of a sudden it stop working. It starts loading but shuts down.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|A new style of music for the band, just like each album before this one.  Listening to this album brings one solid question to mind, &#34;When are they coming here on tour?&#34;
B00992CF6W|1.0|This game is so boss love finding tons of diamonds<br />In each world just get this game worth evrey penny
B002413TY2|4.0|I think this was a well put together sequel to the first two, it had a good story line and action
0345536886|4.0|This books follows the John Grisham formula - big, bad legal firm;  intelligent, hard-working young lawyer;  show-down in court.  Although the formula is much the same as his other books which makes the story-line predictable, I still enjoyed it, but I did have a hard time getting into it (which means it took me over 100 pages to want to keep reading it).  If you enjoyed Grisham's other novels, you will enjoy this one as well.
0385737955|4.0|This book reminded me a lot of Lord of the Flies.  It has that same group mentality of survival of the fittest.  I really felt for Thomas.  I enjoyed this one, it was my first time reading this author and I felt like the writing was similar to Scott Westerfeld.  I loved the ending!  I'm looking foward to reading the next one in this series.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />The characters felt underdeveloped at times.  Also, this is probably better for kids, young teens, and men not interested in romance as it is all action, all the time (like Scott Westerfeld) and absolutely no love interest at all.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The surprise at the end.  No one is who you think they are!<br /><br />Appropriate for a younger audience:<br />Yes
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Friends told me about Downton Abby. They said, \\"Watch one episode, and you'll be hooked.\\" What they said was true! Actually I was hooked minutes into the first episode! The characters were so real--like people I actually knew. The surroundings---the furnishings---the costumes-----I loved everything about it.  I watched all three seasons and am now ready for season four in January.
0385742886|4.0|The Maze Runner trilogy was hit-and-miss for me:  The Maze Runner (book one) was just okay, The Scorch Trials (book two) was excellent, and The Death Cure (book three) was good but not great.  I had a lot of questions after finishing The Death Cure, so I was really excited to see that Dashner has written a prequel to the series.  Finally, a chance to get my questions answered!<br /><br />The Kill Order starts with Teresa (I still don't really know how I feel about that sneaky girl) watching Thomas go through the procedure to have his memories wiped. She is watching Thomas, the boy she loves, go through the procedure, all the while knowing she will also go through it the next day, and be delivered to The Maze all in the quest for a cure for The Flare.  The prologue ends with Thomas being delivered into the Glade.<br /><br />The majority of the book takes place 13 years prior, a year after the sun flares damaged the earth.  Mark and Trina are the main characters, both losing their entire family to the sun flares. They stick together, and meet up with Alec and Lana, who are middle-aged former military members.  Their military backgrounds are what save Mark and Trina from certain death in the aftermath of the sun flares.  The group, along with a couple of other members, escape to the mountains, somewhere near North Carolina.<br /><br />They form a settlement and are beginning to feel some hope that the world can survive...only to have something even more outrageous than the sun flares happen: people in gas masks and hazard suits come to their camp, from a Berg (like a futuristic helicopter) and shoot members of the camp with darts.  Mark and Trina soon discover that the darts contain a virus, which kills most of their friends.  The virus is called The Flare, and it is mutating as it spreads, causing insanity to the people it infects.  Mark, Trina, Alec and Lana go on a mission to find the people spreading the virus to try to stop it.<br /><br />My main complaint about The Death Cure was that there was a lot of fighting.  It was a gritty novel, and The Kill Order was very similar in that regard.  There were so many fight scenes that they were beginning to feel recycled by the end of the book.  I'm sure a male reader would feel differently and appreciate the fighting more than I did, but all that violence got old for me.<br /><br />My favorite part of The Kill Order was finding out the answers as to how and why The Flare was released.  I got exactly what I wanted out of the book: answers and closure.  I am glad that I read The Kill Order, because it completely finished out the series for me.  I also liked the relationships between Alec and Mark and Mark and Trina.  The other Maze Runner books did not have that level of emotional intimacy between characters, and I appreciated the softer side of Dashner's writing.  The ending was bittersweet, and wholly appropriate to the series.  I loved the epilogue at the end, with Thomas and his mother.  It was really touching, and provided some extra warmth to the book.<br /><br />If you're new to the Maze Runner series, I would start with The Kill Order.  It will help the rest of the books make sense, and you'll get more out of them, having understood what happened in the past to cause the present events.<br /><br />I really enjoy James Dashner's writing and would definitely read him again.  His books are more action-packed and grittier than my usual reads, but they are very unique and well-executed.he Death Cure was that there was a lot of fighting.  It was a gritty novel, and The Kill Order was very similar in that regard.  There were so many fight scenes that they were beginning to feel recycled by the end of the book.  I'm sure a male reader would feel differently and appreciate the fighting more than I did, but all that violence got old for me.<br /><br />My favorite part of The Kill Order was finding out the answers as to how and why The Flare was released.  I got exactly what I wanted out of the book: answers and closure.  I am glad that I read The Kill Order, because it completely finished out the series for me.  I also liked the relationships between Alec and Mark and Mark and Trina.  The other Maze Runner books did not have that level of emotional intimacy between characters, and I appreciated the softer side of Dashner's writing.  The ending was bittersweet, and wholly appropriate to the series.  I loved the epilogue at the end, with Thomas and his mother.  It was really touching, and provided some extra warmth to the book.<br /><br />If you're new to the Maze Runner series, I would start with The Kill Order.  It will help the rest of the books make sense, and you'll get more out of them, having understood what happened in the past to cause the present events.<br /><br />I really enjoy James Dashner's writing and would definitely read him again.  His books are more action-packed and grittier than my usual reads, but they are very unique and well-executed.

0802798225|4.0|I loved Elkeles' Leaving Paradise and Return to Paradise and I had a feeling I would like the Perfect Chemistry trilogy just as much.  I went into Perfect Chemistry expecting the things I loved about the Paradise series: complex characters falling in love despite major obstacles, a fast-moving alternating narrative, and an intense story.  And that was exactly what I got.<br /><br />I did not identify with Alex, and to be honest, the whole gang mentality got old for me.  I just didn't get it.  I wanted to smack him upside the head several times.  I hated the bet and the way he treated Brittany at times.  But, I realized he was doing it for a reason, and that ended up making me like him even more. I loved the way Brittany treats her disabled sister.  That was the sweetest part of the book for me, the way Brittany always put her sister first.<br /><br />While this book didn't have the same intensity or feelings as the Paradise series for me, I still really, really liked it.  Simone Elkeles writes excellent contemporary YA that I would recommend to anyone!
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|These lights work perfectly in my laundry room. They come on as soon as motion is detected, provide enough lighting so that we can move around the room. It saves energy because now we don't need to turn on the lights to come through the room, so we no longer have to remember to turn them off, which we did many times before, therefore wasting a lot of energy.
0385738781|3.0|I love dystopia and James Dashner's The Maze Runner trilogy is a great example of what I love best about the genre.  It is fast-paced, full of action and plot twists.  It also has an ironic element which adds a lot to the story.  The emotion is somewhat lacking, which I find to be a common problem with male narrative YA; however, it does not lessen my enjoyment of the story in this series.<br /><br />With all that said, The Death Cure lacked the intensity of the first two books in the series.  Some of the events, especially the fighting, felt recycled.  There was just too much fighting and death for me.  Thomas made some dumb decisions, like how he finally got the chance to get his memories back but refused.  Didn't he complain for two whole books about his lack of memories?  I thought he would have jumped at the chance.<br /><br />There were a lot of poignant moments, especially surrounding the Cranks, most notably Newt.  The ending of Newt and Thomas' friendship made me cry.  I felt so bad for Newt!<br /><br />What I liked best about The Death Cure was the ironic ending.  It made me smile.  I thought it was neat the way Dashner handled the ending, leaving things up to your own interpretation.  Usually I hate that sort of thing but I kind of liked that Thomas never really does know the truth about what is going on.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend The Maze Runner trilogy.  It was a great dystopian adventure, even if I did find the last book to be not quite as good as the first two.

0345525558|5.0|I have Glennon of Momastery (one of my favorite non-book blogs) to thank for the recommendation to read this book.  Glennon chose The Language of Flowers for Momastery's November book club.  I've never participated in an online book club before, but I loved the summary and decided to try something new.<br /><br />The Language of Flowers was a wonderful book!  It's a first person narrative, told from Victoria's perspective.  The book alternates between Victoria's present day life and her past, growing up in the foster care system.  Victoria's childhood was heartbreaking to read about.  To imagine a child with no one to love them made my heart ache.  Especially being a new mother myself.  I can't imagine not having my baby...neither can I imagine what my life would have been like without my wonderful parents.<br /><br />The most unique thing about The Language of Flowers is in fact, the book's focus on the Victorian language of flowers.  I knew that people use to send flowers instead of love letters, to send a certain message while courting, but that's all I knew about the language of flowers.  To get sort of an education on that topic was really fun and unexpected.  I loved how Victoria uses flowers to express her emotions, since she never really learned how to communicate emotion in a healthy way.<br /><br />There were times I had a hard time connecting with Victoria.  She made a few decisions I neither agreed with or completely understood.  But in the end, she had grown and changed so much that I really respected her.<br /><br />Diffenbaugh's personal experience with the foster care system made Victoria's childhood read very authentically.  I loved the writing style, pacing and emotions.  I highly recommend this book and will definitely read Vannessa Diffenbaugh again!
B00DU74U74|5.0|I read the book before seeing this, so I was already very emotionally attached to the characters. Bad choice. I bawled the whole time. Loved this movie, you will too. Maybe. I don't know you. But I'm pretty sure most people will like it... and you're most people. So, enjoy. Or don't.
0385738765|4.0|I am surprised at how much I ended up liking this book.  I enjoyed The Maze Runner, but thought the book was a little slow at times.  The Scorch Trials starts at a fast pace and does not let up until the end of the story.  There is a total Catching Fire-type ending here: at the end of the last page, Dashner writes: \\"END OF BOOK TWO just like Suzanne Collins did.  I'm hoping the series will end with a third book, and not more than three books.  I really like trilogies better than long, drawn out series---especially when I have to wait a year between releases!<br /><br />Thomas is starting to regain some of his memories and is trying to piece together his past and the meaning behind the Trials and WICKED.  He is shocked several times by people he thought were his allies.  There were definitely some \\"DREAMS SHATTERED\\" moments in this book, especially towards the end.<br /><br />One of my complaints about The Maze Runner was that there was a lack of love story.  The Scorch Trials, while far from being a book about love, did have more of a romantic element to it.  Thomas is loyal to Teresa but meets Brenda and starts to have feelings for her too.  The love story element is not a central part of the story but is nevertheless a nice addition.<br /><br />I would recommend this series to fans of dystopia.  Fans of Scott Westerfeld and Suzanne Collins will love it.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />This book is pretty gory.  There were several times I got pretty grossed out (admittedly, I do have a weaker stomach now that I'm pregnant).<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The intricate and intense plot.<br /><br />Appropriate for a younger audience:<br />It's about the same level as The Hunger Games series.

B0034DGPEU|2.0|Ms. Grissom obviously conducted extensive research about the period in which this book is set; however, it is full of clichés from every book or movie that's ever been done about manor life, pre-Civil War. To name a few: the loving and over-weight Mama matriarch to all the slaves; the delicate, wife and lady of the manor who's too weak to do anything but fret until her husband---the Capt---returns home from his travels; her loving, but to-self-absorbed-in-work husband and plantation owner that can't see his son is being abused by his tutor or that his evil property manager is raping the female slaves and stealing from the plantation; the fair and nice neighbor that has slaves, but is kind to them...I could list more, but you get the idea. Although written from the viewpoint of two female characters, Lavina and Belle, Lavina is clearly the protagonist. The story progresses as one would expect for Lavina, the young, white Irish girl and indentured servant orphaned when her parents die on the Capt's ship. Turns out she's weak and delicate too and it takes reading 90% of the book before she gets any semblance of a back bone and then the book ends abruptly. Although I think Ms. Grissom has an enjoyable prose, the characters are not new and it's hard to root for Lavina.

B009AMAJPA|4.0|Danish director Niels Arden Oplev brings his talent for relentless uneasiness on the screen in this story by Joel Howard Wyman. The theme is not good guy versus bad guy because every character in the film is a bad guy/girl and once the audience tunes into that then the emphasis is on that elusive human reaction to trauma called revenge.<br /><br />Victor (Colin Farrell) is a Hungarian immigrant whose wife and daughter were killed and he is out to destroy the Albanian crime gang that caused their death. He has infiltrated the crime empire run by ruthless kingpin Alphonse (Terrence Howard), with the single purpose of making Alphonse pay for destroying his once happy life. Victor's best friend is crime cohort Darcy (Dominic Cooper) whose obsessive curiosity about his friend opens the story for insertion of all manner of bad tings. As he meticulously orchestrates his vengeance from his high-rise home, Victor watches and is watched by Beatrice (Noomi Repace, a mysterious young woman, her face is disfigured from a car accident, who lives with her mother (Isabelle Huppert) in the apartment across from his. On the surface a fragile woman-child, Beatrice seethes with a rage of her own: she sees the death of the drunken driver who caused her facial excoriations and rebuilding attempts. When she uncovers Victor's dark secrets, she threatens to expose him unless he helps her carry out her own campaign of retribution. Each fixated on avenging the past, they devise a violent and cathartic plan that could change their worlds forever.<br /><br />One of the reasons this film works so well is that incredibly magnetic brooding presence of Colin Farrell, but the other reasons the story pushes along at a breakneck speed is the quality of the rest of the cast. Noomi Repace, Isabelle Huppert (still one of the finest actresses on the screen today), Dominic Cooper, Terrence Howard, Armand Assante, F. Murray Abraham, James Biberi, Luis Da Silva Jr., Stu Bennett, Franky G and all the members of this huge cast deliver well for director Opley.<br /><br />This is a dark film about the dark subject of revenge. With Colin Farrell at the helm it works very well! Grady Harp, July 13of this huge cast deliver well for director Opley.<br /><br />This is a dark film about the dark subject of revenge.

B003NS1JHY|1.0|Total crap.  A crummy attempt to capitalize on the classic Robert Conrad/Ross Martin TV series.  The music was just a terrible.  I was only able to sit thru 1/3 of the movie (if that) and then I walked out.  Whomever was the casting director should be forced to watch the entire movie.  Come to think of it, the director, writers, etc., should all be made to watch the movie as a lesson on what not to release in movie form.  This was/is a straight to DVD product.  Terrible effort and product!!

B00DU74U74|4.0|I could not help but be intrigued by the moral implications of this film.  The concept of a \\"perfect\\" inhuman society imposed upon \\"imperfect\\" humans was the source of conflict.  As an imperfect human I would prefer imperfection, since I believe the vacant desire for perfection is one that exists only in the mind of those who wish perfection of others and are dissatisfied with their own being.  The perfect, or emotionless and mindless society advanced by \\"superior\\" beings may be a view into the future.  But what price must humans pay for such boring perfection?  There must never be a guarantee of a perfect, intellectually and emotionally dead society when the individual has so much humanity within.  If there is a message to this film it is for individuals to fight against the domination of a society that pursues some goal of inhuman mechanistic perfection in exchange for comfort.  Life is not lived for the anesthetic comforts a society or government can deliver in exchange for its preservation of power.  Life is a vital experience to be lived without the presence of dictates of those who believe they know better than any individual how a life must be lived and experienced in full.  There should be no societal comfort mandated upon us since we, as individuals, can create our own comfort.  A good film with an inspiring message.

B008JFUQ3O|1.0|WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first film, but I did not have high hopes for the second-- after all, what gave the original all of it's charm (meeting the girls, seeing the relationship between them and Gru blossom) had been wrapped up in a little bow...what else needed to be said?<br /><br />Five minutes into the second film, I realized that the writers agreed with me.  They had nothing to say.  So this is about 90 minutes of minions, minions and more minions- oh, and two lame romances I can't imagine either the kids watching the movie or the parents who accompanied them could give a damn about.<br /><br />I knew I was in for a LONG 90 minutes when I realized that the fart gun- a harmless, three-second gag in the first film, was going to be shown as a freaking institution in the second.  \\"20-fart salute?\\"  Um, the gun was made by ACCIDENT in the first film.  Dr. Nefario said \\"ok, I wondered why anyone would have any use for this...\\"  There are TWENTY in the second film?  And it's used TWICE? Wasn't funny ONCE!<br /><br />Then the romance storylines.  Groan.  Nobody cares if Gru finds a wife (including Gru.)  NOBODY cares if the oldest girl finds a boyfriend.  I'm grateful that the opportunity for product placement when we find she's texting someone was passed by at least.  The girl Gru falls for is annoying as hell, and a really good reason not to see Despicable Me 3, if the rest of this mess wasn't enough already.<br /><br />Finally, I was really annoyed at the dropped plot point concerning the villain's kid.  The villain has a young son- yet he's willing to commit murder and transform thousands of minions- and HIMSELF- into a rampaging, homicidal beast...umm, if he does this, who is going to take care of the kid?  We kind of needed to see some resolution here- if the villain is now captured and facing prison, what becomes of his son?<br /><br />Anyway, this film was a chore to sit through, so unlike the first film, which was a pleasureI've gone back to several times.  What a shame.

0062255657|5.0|I'm not entirely sure that I would be able to do justice in describing Neil Gaiman's The Ocean at the End of the Lane. The book is equal parts nostalgia, beauty, terror, and magic. Nostalgia for a simpler time when magic was all entirely too possible for a young child; the book is beautifully written, nothing forced, it just is; Gaiman's writing is capable of creating such terrifying imagery to what can scare a child, something that would not be possible in less deft hands; Gaiman has created a magic all his own for adults, by reminding us that once upon a time, our childhood selves did believe in magic, and somehow he reawakens that sense of wonder in this small volume he has crafted. It's a wonder that such a slim little book is capable of manifesting so many emotions in such a short time. This is Neil Gaiman we're speaking of, so of course it really comes as no surprise to me when I really think about it.<br /><br />I think I may just leave this review, for what it's worth, at that. I mean, I could go on and on about the book, but I don't want to give anything away. The magic of the book is in letting it speak for itself, telling you its story, and letting you take it all in.<br /><br />So, if I haven't made it obvious, this is a book worth reading. I know it will be topping my list of books for the year, and I know it's going to be one that I will be revisiting over and over again through the years. This book and I are going to become best friends.<br /><br />Go and read it. Read it again. You won't be sorry.

B000002U9L|4.0|This is some of Bowie's best late-'80s work, which is a dubious distinction. My declaration is also complicated by the fact that Trevor Horn is responsible for probably more than half of it, and certainly the crispness of the production. It veers from goofy to outright weird, but that's pretty much par for the course with Bowie. I would suggest this album as an interesting artifact for the collector rather than an entry to Bowie's work if that's what you're looking for. If you're getting into this album because of the movie, then you already know what you're getting, so enjoy.

B003E33RDW|5.0|As of this writing (July 2013), this is Radiohead's last perfect mix of the highly listenable with the highly interesting. They may have better albums (Kid A, OK Computer), and they may have more obtusely cerebral albums (Kid A, Amnesiac), but this one certainly ranks one of their best, smartest, AND most listenable, ALL AT THE SAME TIME, which is something that most bands never even approach. The fact that Radiohead had already done this twice (Kid A, OK Computer) is no reason not to embrace this album as the masterpiece that it is. Don't embarrass yourself by not owning this record for any longer than you have to.

B009MYARIK|4.0|Lots of laughs, great book as always from Sophie kinsella a great way to distract your mind from ordinary life...
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|Shows exactly how strong love is and how everything happens for a reason. :) truly heart warming and inspiring!!!! Emily Griffin is great.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|I finally got around to watching this wonderful movie and discovered why it is a classic.<br />Even by today's standard, its well acted and a good story.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Although some of the writing is redundant it's still very entertaining. A more explicit 50 Shades, also a little more believable. Just good, raunchy fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Maybe I should tell people not to start watching it since you'll be glued to the tv until it ends. This season was so good. Too good. Now I can't wait for the next season!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have tried some other e-readers but none of them is a easy to read as this one!  Get it!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Good game to pass the time. Its not spectacular but would recommend for anyone wanting something to keep them busy while out and about!
B008BRC7BE|4.0|all fine and very quick deliver but Brazilian importing taxes pre-charge is not fine<br />CD Universe estimate Brazilian taxes but do not pre-charge, so I may be lucky not to be elected to taxes payment at Brazilian custums. There is also a free of taxes import for values bellow US$ 50 on books and cds, cultural stuff, so matain this possibility is better.<br /><br />Thanks
193700788X|4.0|This was the final installment in the Sookie Stackhouse saga. It was amazing till the end. Maybe my rating was biased because the ending left me wanting more, or hoping there would be more. Well, there it is. Enjoy this one!
B008OTTSX4|4.0|all fine and very quick deliver but Brazilian importing taxes pre-charge is not fine<br />CD Universe estimate Brazilian taxes but do not pre-charge, so I may be lucky not to be elected to taxes payment at Brazilian custums.

0811875539|5.0|My husband purchased this book for me for Christmas, and I wanted this calendar so I could possibly frame some of the pictures I'm so in love with. If you love birds, you need to check out Andrew Zuckerman's work!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game, it's a lot like some of my other games. However, mine only worked the first  time I downloaded it which is getting me very frustrated. But I do love minions!!
B0068THAGY|4.0|This seems like it is the modern day version of Stand By Me. Bunch of kids, altered by significant event.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Just like a Kindle, but on your phone, LOVE LOVE LOVE.  Only wish my phone plan had unlimited data, but...
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This is a difficult book to understand because it has so many story lines and characters.  Watching the DVD helped, and I stayed with the book to the end.  Might try reading it again later to see if I understand what is happening any better!
B007EECSFA|3.0|This novel seemed to go on forever.  I thought it was cleverly crafted but knew ahead of time what the outcome was to be.
B0027MJU00|3.0|If not reading it for a book club, I would have stopped reading.  But, although the language was offensive, I found the story interesting enough that I had to continue to the end.  Will read a sequel if it is published.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I started playing this game and could not stop playing! It is super addictive and fun! I would definitely recommend this app.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|Really good. Great magic system, tons of good characters, neat plot. What more do you want, people? Brandon Sanderson seems pretty great. Would have given it 4.5 stars if I could.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|The movie was a little slow developing but the story was good.  My 11 year old daughter loves it and it was appropriate for her age.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Cute little minions .. literally stole the whole show !! Buy a copy for the archives .. this is one for the memories :))))
B001NA6096|4.0|We watched this to get ready for Before Midnight. I had not seen it and really enjoyed seeing them both so young. The dialog throughout the movie was great and the scenery was beautiful. Not a lot happens during the movie but its definitely an enjoyable hour or so.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I loved the story line in this book.  After reading the previous two, it just flowed on brilliantly.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves good old fashioned romance and raw sex.
B00821OX98|4.0|Was good over all got me a couple times with aliens jumping out at me. Loved it can't wait to get through sesson2
B008CPRLP2|5.0|this app works to my expectations (just like the desktop version). it is free and has no adverts it in.
0989524116|5.0|There is a reason Brandt Legg is the fastest rising authorial star in any reality: his world perspective is a blend of a childlike appreciation of the mysteries of existence and a harsh view of the brutality of reality that only real living can fashion.  Brandt Legg has experienced the zenith of triumph and prosperity and the nadir of despair and loss.  That's why, in a fictive world that pushes the limits of the imagination, he can inject harsh doses of reality as we know it, including death \\"that just shouldn't happen.\\"  Rather than see himself as a victim of crushing loss, in real life Legg emerges like the phoenix again and again, rising to reinvent himself as an individual of substance, regardless of the profession in which he cloaks himself.  He is now an author for the ages, and his talent is timeless - as is his love for his son, his wife, his (outstanding) mother, his brothers.  This is a man who has lived, and even more unlike the rest of us, has incorporated into his life's view a comprehensive understanding of all the failings and pain and loss that make all his victories that much sweeter.  Yes, OUTIN (The Inner Movement) is a winner; but that's because the man who penned it is a giant.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|I recently switched from the Xbox 360 to the PS3.  I prefer the Xbox controller so I was very happy to see this one on Amazon.<br />The first thing I noticed was that it is very light weight. It felt cheap to me but I chose to ignore that because I wanted this controller. If it was just that, it would be no big deal, but it's not. Both analog sticks feel very cheap as well. The right stick is slightly off when compared to the xbox's. For me, this is an issue because I have small hands so I felt like I was constantly stretching. Not very comfortable. I ended up with my thumb just barely touching the outer rim. That was a negative. The thing is... it's a great idea but not made very well. The buttons seem to work well, but the triggers are too hard to press, on top of the other things. I did notice the dead zone others talked about but it wasn't a big deal to me.<br />I wanted to return it but I found out I'd have to pay about half the price to send it back. So, now I'm stuck with this thing that I am very unhappy with. I won't be buying from this seller any more. This controller was so off that it made me happy to plug the original PS3 one back in. I think I just stick with that one. Ironic!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I enjoy Gaiman's writing style and own a number of his books & movies. However, the theme of \\"Ocean\\" is too much like that of Coraline and Mirrormask. Once again adults are not what they seem and children are made to fear those who should protect them.  It was easy to guess what would happen next and, where some find comfort in a writer's formula, this latest creation by Gaiman left me bored.
B008UTV6S8|4.0|I've never been disappointed with a Paul Simon performance and this is no exception.  At 71 Paul Simon still puts on a great performance.  This DVD/CD has a great selection of songs.  Still hoping to see the Central Park concert on DVD.
B007L24T52|3.0|I didn't love this book at all. I have read most of David Baldacci's books and have found over the last few years he has gone off the boil a bit. Story was a bit slow and to be honest by the time I got halfway through I actually didn't care what happened. Finishing this book was a bit of a chore.
0689853637|5.0|You cannot deny the talent of Robert Sabuda. You can teach a person to teach or you can hire a person gifted to teach. Robert Sabuda is just gifted and his work is geared to grasp the awe of the child or adult's imagination. This will be in the family forever.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this one better than 100 floors. Easy, fun, and reminds me of detective work.  Great way to pass the time.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved the male narrative of this book. Humorous, blunt, honest point of view that all of womankind find chauvinistic and demeaning. But when love kicks in the lady still brings 'em to his knees. This book is erotic and fun all wrapped up in one great read.
B000ID37RM|5.0|This is a classic that everyone, young and old should see AFTER reading the book. The casting was superb and the book was really brought to life.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The Rio game I found more enjoyable than any of their other themes. It was also more colorful. I prefer this to the original.
B00985E3UG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this read. Clean, smart, & readible.  I won't eat the same way again. Quite an eye opener.  \\"Blisspoint\\" reached!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|Really, really bad placement of the undo button. My 6yr old enjoyed it for a bit but every one of her models ended up bald! The couple that I tried to do came out ok until I got to the top of the head where I accidentally hit the undo button. Which goes straight back to the beginning.  Wouldn't it be better to go back one or two steps? And there is no way to undo the undo. Music is nice but the app wants you to buy buy buy and the prices for what you get are ridiculous.  Sorry but this won't be staying on my daughters tablet.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I like this game however I feel that with some slight upgrades it would be better.  I felt sometimes I would find something in a room and then not be able to find it again because of the limited way to view the room.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I loved this final book of the Mistborn series.  The author really answered all questions you had and came up with a great ending.
B00DU73T08|1.0|Stopped watching an hour into it and jumped out of a window because it was so boring...the trailer misrepresents the actual storyline and how she talks to herself.  It would be nice if I could get my $5 back, I should've known better though than to watch another cheesy film from the Twilight writer.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's very similar to the app for jellybean. It doesn't nessasarily knock your socks off, but at least its an app-not just a shortcut that opens a browser. I do recommend it, over the &#34;stock&#34; way it's been handled on the Kindle Fire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It Was AWESOME.ME and my friend play this game just to see the fat guy getting hit by the trains going by.my pet rock loved the game sooooooo much,it even beat our high scores.his name is ummm he lives in a fish bowl on the curb 5blocks from my apt.he is vicious.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin Hayward is an amazing combination of Songwriter, Musician, Singer, and Spiritual Visionary.<br />His ability to put his Spiritual Concepts of Feeling and Thoughts into words and music is Truly Amazing.<br />Like fine wine, he is only getting better.<br />Those who &#34;listen&#34; are truly blessed by: Music with so much Feeling<br />  Words with so much Meaning
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Usually sequel games are more of the same and predictable. This 3rd quell is really exceptional. The first two quell games are great, but this one is even better. Lots of levels, and new challenges,  really engaging, and thought provoking.Loved it.
B004G6009U|5.0|How can you not love this movie?!  And the Blu-Ray pack is great, good price too!  My wife and I have watched it several times, if you've never seen it, it is worth it!
B009HEMW4W|1.0|Buy it if you like stupid movies that sell by advertising 3 funny parts for the whole movie<br />The story line major lacked, I have a hard time believing it was the same person who wrote the 1st 2 movies<br />Put this one in the dollar section
B004QMW1NM|5.0|They have done a fantastic job with an original sound and not making EVERY song sound the same.  Sure a couple of them do like Young Blood and Punching in a Dream, but they have a TON of variety on this album!  I love it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very clever strategic game. Keeps you thinking to find your way out. Frustratingly fun. Don't give up. Use logic. Reached the 10 levels with a challenge.
B003Y5H574|5.0|My wife and I watched this movie several times within a couple weeks of buying it.  We love it!  It is probably one of the funniest movies you will ever see and if you quote movies, this is definitely one that will be quoted!
0452289963|4.0|WOW. This is a great book! It has really helped me. Thanks to my sister for recommending it to me.
0545265355|5.0|The hard covers are amazing, the case is great and everything looks really good.  if you love getting hooked on a series you can read quickly, read these!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I kept seeing and hearing great things about this book. I've had it on my list of books to read for quite some time. I am now asking myself why I have waited so long. This is the first book to ever give me goose pumps and had tears flowing. Hopeless is a definite MUST read.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The customer service department/person was so very helpful and efficient when I called about the problem that occurred to my original USB cable for my Kindle.  Now I am able to be reading again!!!  Thanks so very much.
B009PAETCG|5.0|This game is super fun it has just the right amount of challenge without being frustrating! It's so much fun to try and beat your high score! If you don't have this app get it you will LOVE it!!!!!
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Liam Neeson as a physician in Berlin to present a scholarly paper--yeah right!  Bumps head in car accident, loses memory, and his January Jones wife doesn't recognize him.  So begins astonishing car chases, murders and lots of bodies piling up, ending with him sort of getting the girl, but not his wife.  Very suspenseful and exciting.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Great app.  Seamlessly looks like the real thing! makes checking and responding to emails easy and quick.  I love it.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I had never listened to Lindsey until I heard this album.  Now I can't say enough!!!!!!!!!!  I play the album all the time at home and at work.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|I get to listen to my favorite music for as long as I like and there are no interruptions like you get with streaming.  The only time the music stops is when there is a change in the artist.
1451675046|5.0|I loved this book; Dawkins is writing for the lay person and clearly and thoroughly describes why and how things happen in the natural world. I especially enjoyed the section on rainbows and would (and do) highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone.<br />I would also recommend the books of Victor J Stenger and everything written by Richard Dawkins.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|From what I have read about how to use this app and from the reviews from others you need a wireless printer in order to able to use this eprint app.  It is always good to read what others have said especially the first (5-10) current reviews.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|It's not a bad game. There is a lot of waiting involved and kids may find it frustrating, but overall not a bad game.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This will be a Classic and loved the theme- Tying together the Loki and Thor sibling rivalry and adding all of the classic. Just great!
034580709X|4.0|You do not have to be familiar with Nesbo's published books in English to appreciate this Harry Hole novel.  Nesbo is at the infant stage of creating one of the most successful Norwegian crime series.<br /><br />You may have read The Snowman or Phantom, but if not, you can easily slip into Nesbo's spell-binding art of designing characters who fit the crime and those who are trained to catch the killers.  The initial surprise in the book is the setting.  I didn't except Sydney, Australia since the other books were on Scandinavian soil.  No matter.  Harry Hole arrives in Sydney to solve the murder of a young, Norwegian woman.  Although more than slow-paced in the beginning, I stayed with it because I wanted the back-story about Harry.  It took awhile but Nesbo conveys to the reader details about Harry's early life and we come to understand his self-destructive behavior.<br /><br />There is violence and pain of reminiscences of love which move the novel along.  If one is interested in the Aboriginal culture, Nesbo packs the novel with details that become indispensable to the plot and the ambiance of Sydney.  Apparently, Nesbo is quite familiar with Australia and its criminal history.<br /><br />I recommend the book for new and experienced Nesbo fans.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Always pulls you along but really there's nothing new  here. King always writes kids the way  they are not the way we want them to be...
B00DU74U74|5.0|I gave The Host 5 Stars because they did an excellent job keeping up with the book which these days is such a rare occurrence you never even expect it. It was really brought to life in the film and I didn't have one ounce of disappointment, in fact I was thrilled and excited and moved to tears the whole time.<br />WATCH IT
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I LOVED this series of fifty shades Anna can hold her own when it came to Christian. He thought of as someone who needed protecting when in reality it was him that needed protecting,and Anna was the only person that stood up to him.
B000JML90Y|2.0|I bought this book for research I had to do in a class. It did not give me any information I needed for my paper.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game and dhdidjdjdjdjdjddjjdjd<br /><br />How to ben Affleck and fuzzy and the bottom right now and the Martin's to make a
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|A typical bad portrayal with shallow characters, circumstances and attempts at levity or humour. Should be re-titled This is Awful!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|No words to express the great joy I received from reading this book.  If you've ever lost a dog to old age or lost a loved one to some dreaded disease, this one will open up all those emotions again.  Beautiful and unforgettable.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game of logic.  Some steps not as intuitive as others, but a welcome departure from most games I play
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|I liked the original Tron, although it was a bit amateurish in many ways.  But it was interesting and fun, the girls great looking, etc.  This sequel is also good, certainly better special effects as one would expect, making Jeff Bridges look young again is well done, and Olivia Wilde is good in her part and (my opinion) one of the very best looking girls in movies.  The Blu-Ray quality is excellent.  I gave it four stars rather than five because this sequel is a little muddy in the plot department.  The original had a programmer, or User;, trapped electronically in the computer together with programs and bits and such, and as a User; he had enormous powers that the other programs and such could only worship or be dazzled by.  In this sequel, the father and son programmers do have some power beyond other programs in the computer but it's inconsistent and not as strong as one would expect.  Lush special effects, beautiful girls, an excellent musical score, and the legacy (no pun intended) from the original make it excellent, but short of 5-stars.  Still, I'd recommend it, but see the original one first if you haven't already.
1582701709|5.0|I FOUND IT VERY INTERESTING AND HELPFUL IN MY LIFE.<br />I'M VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS!!!!!!<br />I CAN'T STOP NOW. YOUR GOING TO HAVE TO BUY THE BOOK, TO FIND OUT, WHAT THE SECRET IS!!!!!  LOL.<br />I THINK IT'S A GREAT SECRET!!!!!!<br /><br />  LEE DEE
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Beat game ever .so fun .  No problems at all.  Great  for kids. If your not sure you'll like it you will if you like animals.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was a lot of fun. I accidentally stayed up almost all night just to finish it. Definitely worth the couple of bucks. I'm looking forward to the next Room!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love it!  Great acting, realistic dialogue, very interesting and unique characters. The legal cases are very compelling, seems like a lot of them are based on real current cases.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|One of Disney's best. Classic movie for all. The kids like the animals and the music, and you as an adult will also like the adult content mixed in.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|i was having a blast playing the game here and there and making my park bigger, then the update came. I have not deleted and re-installed in hopes that they fix it.  It seems for those that do not have it linked to facebook, we're screwed!<br />I'll update.... if there is one!<br /><br />Auto update when I turned it on today and everything back to normal, with a kick A new park!<br />Been playing for a while and have not spent a dime on it!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Like Zombie movies... Like British humor? Then you should enjoy this flix. Totally stupid, but funny as hell. Give it a try.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Fantastic showcase for the talents of Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and the rest.  Best film I've seen in quite a while.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|if I can Play this game, anyone can Play this game! Great for People of all ages! Can't wait to see what those little yellow guys are going to do next.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Neat graphics, lots of fun;challenging but not impossible.  Gives you chance to play slower &#34;thinking&#34; games providing a &#34;break&#34; from  the fast moving ones;thinking games can be skipped if desired.  Played fine on samsung.
B000W91RUG|5.0|We love watching Big Bang! Sheldon is hilarious, Rodge is shy and can't talk to women, Howard is a ladies man and still lives with his mother, Leonard & Penny share something special! Love watching Big Bang!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book was great! It kept my attention throughout the entire story. It was a great read for me while I was on deployment.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Pricey but well worth it. very convenient and sound reproduction is superb. Would have wanted a longer cord though but that's not a deal-breaker. Very good concept product.
B00821OX98|5.0|It is very much like Walking Dead, with Aliens instead of zombies, but I think it's better written.  Add to that, that it's not based on a comic or book, to my knowledge at least, so the writers have an ability to change the story and plot at will.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|Love Lust Faith + Dreams is phenomenal! Leto and the boys have impressed me yet again with this album, which I enjoy almost as much as their first album. A must-buy for all Mars fans!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game is doesn't matter where I am I can always play subway surfers I think that kiloo really did a fantastic job on this app
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Again this movie will be for the enjoyment of the whole family, I could watch it myself without the kids. Excellent graphics, very bright colors. I really enjoy watching this movie with my kids.
B00D37UP4S|4.0|Movies very rarely can live up to a good book's storytelling and I worried about this movie because of that. There is a lot of internal dialog that happens between the alien and it's human host in the book but making that translate into a movie format is difficult. That being said I think they did an excellent job with that in this movie and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Although it is listed as compatible with my Galaxy S4, it won't install. It checks if the device is a tablet and, if it's not, it simply doesn't install.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Having grown up with Undressed as the only &#34;scripted&#34; series MTV had, I didn't have high expectations for this show.  It was a pleasant surprise, and I found myself laughing out loud at some of the characters witty dialogue and situations.  Of course, nothing is what would typically be said or thought by high schoolers, but it appeals to adults and teens on equal levels, I'm sure.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Everyone (11 ladies) loved this book in or book group and it prompted very interesting discussions. Lloking forward to reading another one of Moyes' books.
1781162646|2.0|\\"This is a Stephen King novel that you can start on your vacation and actually finish before the flight home.\\" - Men's Health, Selected By Amazon. This quote I do agree with, but mostly because this is a fairly short book and you don't get to delve deep enough into the characters for any deep reading. It's kind of shallow.<br /><br />The plot is good, but I wish Stephen King would stick to horror of any kind and stop with the crime novels/novellas. He doesn't give enough meat in crime stories to hold us horror fans over. That being said, Joyland is better than \\"The Colorado Kid\\" but not as good as \\"Blockade Billy\\" (his other crime offerings from the past).<br /><br />If you are a die-hard King fan, do yourself a favor abd buy this book secondhand. It's not worth the brand new price. If you are a crime or mystery fan, buy it brand new. If you are even the slightest bit curious about the kind of author King is, skip \\"Joyland\\" all together and go get yourself one of his 80's or 90's offerings instead. Cut your King teeth on something truly amazing first, then come back and read \\"Joyland\\" so you can have a better educated opinion on King's works.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun. It gives you different challenges everyday plus levels to do to pass time. I am addicted and I don't think ill ever run out of challanges!
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I really should have read more about this game. I wanted just the basic game everyone can play,  this isn't it....Too hard for me, as of yet.I don't really play it much, just don't like it.  Maybe you will.
B00AVFO41K|4.0|This game is fun and not that hard to figure out. If the pieces won't move it is because they are trapped and no clear pathway is available. Keeping pathways clear and not getting trapped is as important as focusing on aligning five.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|What would happen if the entire human race experienced the same great tragedy? Great mind candy! I really enjoyed this book--it renewed my interest in geopolitics.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldn't stop watching all the episodes in rapid succession since I couldn't wait to find out what happens to all the characters in the story. I was own away by the last episode and can't wait for Season 4 to begin!

B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an excellent treatise on combat leadership in laboratory conditions. As presented in this story, thinking outside the manuals to win at minimal cost should be the mantra of all military officers/leaders. Training everyone to use the strengths of subordinates and companions was also well emphasized. AND it was a great gifted kids story.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I stumbled across this movie the first time about 6 yrs ago. It is so amazing, the music , the actors, and especially the story-line, I had to tell everyone I know they need to watch it!!! I promise you wont be disappointed!
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is so cute and amazing, my 2yr old is fascinated by the characters.  Adults will love this also,nice storyline and keeps you interested. Great movie!!!

B003PUZ2NW|5.0|I SIMPLY ENJOYED THE MOVIE, IT WAS RIGHT IN THERE,  AS MUCH AS THE OLDER ONES AND ADDS TO THE COLLECTION.
B003MC5N28|5.0|The giver was a really good book and was very interesting. It showed a different world where everything is the same. This book shows how differences can be good sometimes and that our world has lots of interesting and important things.
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|Everything looks good on the first season disks. As an old timer I thought that I would object to the remastering and the new special effects elements but I have not even viewed any of the original versions. The new ship effects are well integrated with the look and feel of the original footage and the remastering looks good on an HD screen. Well it looks as good as 480 can on a 1080 system.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Even though this book starts out about two teenagers, it goes so much deeper & farther than them.  I could not put this book down & read it in a day. One of the best books I've ever read!!! I recommend this to people of all ages!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Looking for a great summer read, I came upon this book from my collection. Even though I read it a few years back- I enjoyed it just as much. Great book, that really provides insight into a culture that is misunderstood by many.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I was about 60% through the book before it started to get interesting.  The other books in this series moved a lot faster. It was still a good read, but I'm not as connected to some of the newer characters he's introduced in this book.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Not sure why the British are fascinated with making movies about retirement homes... but they always get me to the core. The new one Quartet is just touching. If you like Downton Abbey there are a few cast members in this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions and this game and the graphics are really cute.  I would recommend it to any age.
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|what an amazing film. i really learned a lot about her life and the very independent style she lived it.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Loved the books and love the episodes. Different, mysterious, the character's moral juxtaposition is just so delicate and fascinating. Why do we root for such a vile, evil and remorseless character? Because we secretly wish we could take matters in our own hands sometimes, don't we? Dexter is a fascinating character and the story line is as well.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|the game is great. just wish easier to buy things. it should offer more stars for accomplishment or make things available to buy with coins
8845247414|5.0|I have loved The Little Prince since I was a child, and it is so fun to be able to read it in Italian!  The book was well-translated also.  I'd recommend this for anyone learning Italian and wanting to add to their collection!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|HORRIBLY............................<br />AWESOME the best infact out of the three<br />Recommended for life, also sad be prepared for the worst. One more word needed, darn.
B00AYR2FQ6|5.0|This CD was a total surprise. I love every song. I bought it because I heard the 3rd track on the radio, but soon learned every other one delivered and added great range and depth to the one I liked first. They also all come together as a whole. On some tracks I was reminded of Will Oldham. A further testament to the incredible artists out there - whom you may not have discovered yet.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Great contribution to the series; answered so many questions.  More to be answered; looking forward to the next step in the evolving psy/changling universe!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This flash is great for quickly improving your indoor photos. Come with very nice soft travel case giving you the ability to take this flash anywhere.
B008G3N71W|1.0|Disliked the Book.<br />The story and character were very unbelievable.  Never finished it because of the gross incidents written about. Would not recommend it to anyone.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Some TV sci-fi comes off as cheesy or thin on plot with a lot of filler like prolonged chase scenes (a red flag that the script is lacking for material). None of that applies to Falling Skies. I believe it is one of those made-for-cable shows that has enough going for it to keep the viewer's attention.<br />My only complaint is that I wish the story arcs were more defined. They can't really resolve the whole premise and keep the show going, but they could wrap up the strings more quickly. They are doing better now, but at first, some of the arcs dragged on a little too long, I  suppose because they were trying to establish the characters.<br />That said, this show is highly recommended for sci-fi fans.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show!!  I can't wait for the next season to come out on prime.  I am a prime member so I am really bummed that I can't watch all the seasons without having to pay for them!  :(
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I was looking for Mario but I found this it's just like Mario. It's super awesome I really like it I can't stop playing. I do wish I could find Mario. But for a replacement game it's good.
B005544TRQ|5.0|So glad to have a show that has some quality to it and not just sex and raunchy humor!  Can't wait for the next season to show up on prime!!
B00AYPXG5W|4.0|No real ending or 3 act structure, but creepy aliens, well done abduction, worth watching if you're in the mood for an alien abduction movie and have already seen close encounters, and the 4th kind
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another masterpiece for Khaled Hosseini. I thought The Kite Runner was sad, but in my opinion, this surpasses that by far. One of my favorite reads of the summer.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is fabulous game that make as you think and rely on you memory.  Not to mention ADDICTING.  Best game ever!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I would say this is probably one of my favorite movies, hands down. Definitely a must see for all ages.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good book that take you through a Taylor Swift range of emotions. There are no good guys here. You certainly won't be bored.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini never fails to get our attention.  We get lost in his characters and how he entwines their lives.  Got so involved this book made me cry
B008220C38|1.0|Great costumes just awful adaptation. I kept hoping it would get better after 1/2hr I gave up, couldn't watch anymore.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|[[ASIN:0425263924 Entwined with You (Crossfire, Book 3)]]  I really disliked how you ended the book, but LOVE that their will be MORE! I just can't get enough of Eva and Gideon so complicated yet so romantic. I know you have great plans for the next book.. Please don't disappoint & Good Luck!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I bought this app thinking it would be cool and fun but it did it's down loading thing then it it brought me back to home. I did it over and over but it just did the same thing over and over. I wish it would work.  :(!
B005544TRQ|5.0|A clever and witty duo makes for entertaining television.  I look forward to seeing more episodes through Amazon Prime viewing.
B0097AX6EQ|5.0|A great book striking at the heart of Vietnam aviation and the dealing with PTSD. Great real encounters with everyday flying and a amazing insight on how to deal with the tricky side to flying a helicopter.<br /><br />Brilliant book.
B008Q09K2U|3.0|...and a bit heavy on narrative as other reviewers have said. You still have the funny quips that are a hallmark of the Corey novels but this effort just lacks the fast movie pace and action of previous outings. Still an enjoyable and easy read but just not up to previous NdM high standards.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Joe Bonamassa never fails to amaze, and even more so on this CD where he coaxes unbelievable sounds out of acoustic guitars.  The intricacies are beautiful - but this is still the powerhouse rock guitarist who adds his own electricity to each song.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|this app used to be great. now they changed to where you have to spend money. they took away free things.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I love the fact that all 8 Blu-Ray disk are in a small package! they are great! I love all the extras you get to see the movies being made and the interviews with the actors!
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|anything with this cast and Scorcese would have to be a classic and filled with great music. Scorcese films have the  best music!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I love that I can read the same book on my ipad and cell phone. I do wish though that I could capture some text and email or paste it. Copyright, schmoppyright. I would just like to be able to save or share a quote. I also find that the scrolling bar at the bottom can be inadvertently hit which is a pain finding my way back to where I was. Finally, if there are any solutions for these wants, I couldn't find them. Kindle help files were very thin.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game was fun and all for like a day then it wouldn't open at all it just says gameloft then exits out of the game.  Also the whole game was circled around Facebook. I wound up using half my tokens to skip a Facebook goal just to get another one. Like I said this game was fun and all but I seems more like a subway surfer rip off more than any thing else.
B007SGM084|1.0|A badly written slow motion piece of work that could have been written in 3000 words. I could not finish tHe frIrSt
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|Bruce Willis is still good as a killing machine ... still a loud music to make sure that you don't fall asleep during the movie.  Moscow to Tchernobyl is a 12 hour drive, not that close.  And where is the police in Moscow when you need it?  This film is for the Willis lovers, but Mr. Willis can do better, he is after all a very good actor.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Basically this CD is various classical songs that were mentioned in the book. I think it's a nice collaboration, and I find it very calming. Even if you didn't read the books, I think it's a nice classical collection. There's nothing sexual about this other than the implications behind the name. I expect these songs will be featured in the movie, once it's released. Purchased this for my mom for Christmas and she enjoyed it. We both have it on our ipods, and I like listening to it before work for the nice calming effect that it has.
B0038GEUU4|5.0|Quality is good. I had no problems downloading it. It's too bad that the band broke up. Nevertheless, there music is still amazing
1847879071|5.0|I hate stats but this book is really useful and if your buying this its because its required for a class so you may as well get it.
B006PKQQJS|4.0|I love this game. Wish it was longer because it gets addicting and you can't stop playing it. Would love to get more like it.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|For those wondering how this mouse works with Mac: it works with the presets, but you will need a PC with driver to customize the settings.<br /><br />At first I was worried the default polling rate wouldn't work on my Mac, but it worked as soon as I plugged it in. The default DPI presets (200, 800, 2000, 8000 I believe) couldn't be changed until I could change it on PC. I play League of Legends and FPS games so it was difficult to be forced to adopt to the default DPIs. As soon as I got my hands on a PC I installed the driver and was able to adjust each DPI setting and the color of the glowing Anker logo. The settings are saved and I'm able to use it on my Mac, and it works great! I love the ergonomics and braided cable. I wish there is a driver for Mac in the future though.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|This is more of a chick flick, but was kind of cool. Was expecting more action, just kind of corny.
0786956291|5.0|I love this game. Though my first time playing DnD, the books inside is clear and easy to understand.<br />the shipping time is a little bit too long though.
B00AVFO41K|1.0|It doesn't even have rules or even how to play the game! I had to guess how it's played, without the description I wouldn't even know what the goal of the game was, needs more information. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It is truly unfortunate this man is no longer with us. This is a great story about a very brave soldier.
B004SBULWE|4.0|New to the android arena I am bad about closing things before opening others.  This seems to help a lot with data running in the background.  It may even save battery life.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is an amazing story. The only bad part is that you already know the sad outcome. You will find yourself wishing for a different ending. This is one of the most heart wrenching stories I've ever read. It's a book that everyone needs to read.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|I really like how intuitive the graphics make the application. I have replaced my old Weather Channel application with this one.  Even Weather Channel's latest upgrade does not compete.  Good job Weather Live!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I've been playing all day and I can't stop. I can't wait to get all the achievements and unlock all of the cute characters. All ages will love th is game.
B000001GPX|1.0|This is...I have been trying to understand this recording since 20 years ago and still feel same. Rushing for nothing. Was he trying to make classical music to Rock music feel?<br />Most of the time, I listen to Bruno Walter and Peter Maag and admire Beethoven from deep inside of my heart.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|This game is very confusing it doesn't make any sense to fast and doesn't explain its purpose will delete it from my tablet
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I have a Intel Core i7 2600k, before applying the Artic Silver 5 the idle temp was about 37-40 C, now it idles at 29-32 C, but at the same time I cleaned the CPU Heatsink  radiator and replaced the case for a Cooler Master HAF 912.<br /><br />I still believe that the Artic Silver was what caused the temperature drop, with the other case and the Thermaltake thermal compound the temperature never get any lower than 35 C.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|Upstairs Downstairs is an interesting drama about British aristocracy. I like the characters and the way each character develops throughout the series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyable game to get your brain going.  Not difficult at all.  Husband and I went through it fairly quickly.  Hopefully more rooms will be added.
B008Y73940|5.0|I remember when the movie came out in theaters, I ignored it. I thought it was some boring drama about a do-gooder lawyer, or even maybe a late 19th century period piece. Boy was I wrong! This is a legal thriller in the league of Gresham.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is such a fun game to have. Not only is it addicting, and easy to play but it's also educational. This game you can just pick up and play without much need for tutorials. The graphics are great, even down to the representation of the characters from the movies. There isn't much need to use real money to purchase things due to everything being earned with enough time and patience. The glacial upgrade was a nice surprise after playing for a few months.<br />I would recommend this game for any gamer that's into simulation games.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|I love this movie and never get tired of watching it. An amazing cast and well written. In the pantheon of mob/gangster movies.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I could not put this book down. Complex characters and surprises at every turn of the page. I highly recommend this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the game even though it is pretty challenging. My granddaughter told me all about it so I thought I would give it a try. I am sure glad I did. Keep up the good work!
B007CFL4WO|5.0|I had already ready this book and decided to order it.  It's a delicate treatise on the holocaust, and since genocide still goes on today in other countries, under the various guises of bigotry - name a difference and there you have it and usually sanctioned by politics or religion, I think it's worth a read to remind.
159463176X|4.0|[[ASIN:159463176X And the Mountains Echoed]]<br /><br />Hosseini is one of my favorite authors and the book was well worth reading.  I would have given him five stars but felt that so many characters made it confusing.  I kept having to go back through the book to find out who was who.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I am totally captivated by this book.  I am not only learing about the history of WW1, but am entertained by several romances and struggles for freedom.  It makes me appreciate our country more when you see the afflictions of tsar and monarch period peasants.<br /><br />I've downloaded Kindle on my phone so I can read at lunch now!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I haven't read any Baldacci in quite a while, and was so happy I picked this one up. Loved it. I inadvertently read the second book in the Robie series before this one, but I was really glad I backtracked. Looking forward to more Will Robie!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I love that a real card game has finally made it to the mobile market. It gets a 4/5 because it lags a bit on my kindle fire and the damage sequence is a bit slow. Otherwise perfect!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is a story about the Zombie Apocalypse that avoids getting mired in meaningless drivel about secret govt agencies or heartless corporations cooking up a zombie plague and attempts to answer the more important question: how do we survive it?
B0094KT68O|5.0|My little 3 year old is obsessed with buzz light year! Great continuation from the first movie! Looking forward to ordering toy story 3!
B005PK553C|5.0|Excellent show!  Loved watching it at my own leisure as I always seem to miss tv shows when they are televised.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I've learned a lot about myself from reading this book and I hope it brings forth positive change in my relationships.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|game down loaded then i clicked on the game to play from my kindle fire it goes to the screen to load the game but then goes back to my main screen to pick to play the game. glad it was free since i cant play it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome if you love despicable me yell love this game it's. just like temple run 2 so get the game
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Another fantastic psy novel for Nalini Singh. We've been waiting with bated breath to finally find out who the person was that meant so much to Kaleb Krychek, and what was going to happen to the psy net as it began to disintegrate. This book filled in all the blanks and still leaves you wanting more. Nalini's stories are exciting, well rounded, sexy and complex.One of the best writers around in my opinion.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I enjoy Castle.  I don't watch network shows, but Castle is different.  Acting is great and very intertaining.  Well done.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun app. The puzzles can be hard but that's the challenge. It is also very addictive, I can't seem to stop.
B000001ZS4|5.0|Beautiful album, The sound is mystical, almost organic. Sound from the water, the nature, the Earth. Sound quality is amazing, too.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun and a good time waster. Although games like this are not my favorite this one is cute and entertaining
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game that entertains the kids and for that matter me. I like that as the game progresses the speed increases making it difficult but entertaining
B005LAII12|5.0|I enjoyed watching this with a friend. It was shockingly funny; so when a family member was depressed, I ordered it for her to lift her spirits. It worked! She said she laughed so hard.
1476734941|1.0|I've never written a bad review before, but this deserves one.  This book was described in a TV report as a cookbook, but there are only a handful of recipes in the back.  The book is mostly a long rambling narrative of all the typical weight-loss advice we've heard a million times over.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like it because I didn't know what to do at first but then I got the hang of it . Now am so absest with it ;-)
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was an easy to read novel, that was still beautifully written and stimulating.  John Green was able to bring the characters to life, despite the unfathomable theme that is terminal illness.  This novel deals with serious subject matter while never failing to highlight the spirit of the American teen.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Absolutely incredible information and best of all, IT WORKS! Everyone should be mandated to read it and to follow it. America would be much healthier.
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|i suppose that being the first book it is not as good as all his others which i have read all
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Love this movie SOO much! Great for families, but funny for adults too. It's one I never get tired of re-watching.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I wasn't even aware that Teen Wolf was even a series.  According to my friend Cynthia it's pretty good.  And she is the reason for this particular purchase.  She's into the whole vampire, wolf, zombie saga's.  Not my taste, personally.  But, to satisfy friend with something this simple is all I could not buy it.  Maybe it'll last a couple of more seasons and I'll end up getting her all of 'em.
B004I744AS|5.0|I enjoy the daily updates. I do a lot of writing and I need to make sure all my words are are s9ell correctly.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for the next one!<br />Kept my interest the whole entire book.<br />I would recommend it to every woman.
0142000655|5.0|The best book written by Steinbeck! I have no idea how many times I've read it but \\"East of Eden\\" is my all-time favorite read!
B006JD48NM|4.0|It's very good to know about this race driver, his life as a driver, his charities that everybody learned about it only after his death. For me there is no driver like him, today the cars drive themselves, at Senna's time the driver had to be a &#34;driver&#34; not the car.
B005HF0F0S|5.0|I just love this series. It is very unique, the stories are great and the acting terrific. I would recommend this series to anyone looking for a little bit of escapism.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|5/5 Star Review<br /><br />I have only been compelled to write one other review on Amazon. However, based on the controversy surrounding this item I think I need to say something. I was hesitant to pull the trigger on this one based on many of the people stating issues with these albums. I decided I would order the set and try them out one at a time (I did so in reverse chronological order) and see for myself if there were any issues. Here is my experience.<br /><br />Shipping: I received the set quickly, within 4 business days. The box arrived well packed with foam inserts that suspend the entire set and everything was in pristine condition.<br /><br />Opening the album box: I chose to carefully razor open the “sleeve” that surrounds the box of albums from both the top and bottom. I cut only the front, back and left side on the top and front, back, and right side on the bottom. I then taped down the front and back shrink, top and bottom using crystal clear tape. Then I taped each “free” side and folded down the remaining two-shrink wrap “flaps” inside the “sleeve” and taped them down. This allows the “sleeve” to remain protected and still slide on and off.<br /><br />Opening the albums: I opened each album with a razor blade and taped down the shrink (as I do with all my new albums) using crystal clear scotch tape. I carefully slide out each album as I was playing them and gently wiped them with a microfiber towel. (When I say gently, I mean barely making contact. Just enough to get rid of dust and not build up and static electricity.) All the original items that were included with the albums are here - posters, custom inner sleeves, information cards, 5 x 7 pictures, etc. - all in pristine condition. Each album has a custom inner sleeve with a poly liner – white for the Parlophone releases and black for the Apple releases (that’s right, no Capitol reprints – I was so used to my own albums it was interesting to see the difference). These are all exact copies of the originals, seeing them in their “original” condition was great, but hearing them was even better.<br /><br />Playing the albums: I had almost zero issues with all albums. The all played nearly flawlessly. All the albums played fine on my both my Jensen JTA-220 and Crosley CR49 (That’s right, I played them all twice on two separate record players). The music was crisp and clear, much better than my collection of second-hand Beatle albums I had collected or inherited over the years. The tone was slightly better on my Jensen as it has external speakers. I could hear sounds that I had not previously and was pleasantly surprised. Now for one minor issue. The exceptions were Magical Mystery Tour and Abbey Road. The albums played great just like all the others. However, there was a slight “wooshing” sound as the album made each revolution – ONLY audible during the “blank” spaces between songs. When I looked closely I could see that the disc was not laying completely flat and my stylus was moving up and down a bit more then usual. (Not breaking contact mind you, just moveing up and down with the motion of the record.) Let me repeat that this sound was ONLY noticeable for the first couple of “spaces” between the songs. While the songs were playing, I could NOT hear the “wooshing”. Also, as the stylus moved toward the center the sound became almost inaudible. By the time the last break between songs had passed it was a non-issue for me.<br /><br />Overall: I loved listening to all these albums again and will continue to enjoy them on a regular basis. I have a special place in my heart (as millions do) for The Beatles and their songs. (I even wrote my undergrad thesis on the marketing of The Beatles to American audiences during the 1960s) Yet I digress. I believe that this set is better then most have stated and that there may have been significant issues early on in the release of these albums, but for me they were spot on and a major upgrade from the albums I possessed prior to purchasing this wonderful set. Try it for yourself. Worst-case scenario, you return it for a refund. Just be sure to order from Amazon.<br /><br />P.S. I have yet to open the book. I have numerous Beatle books and want to keep this one sealed for the time being.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is the set of 3 books in the Hunger Games trilogy (Hunger Games, Catching Fie, and Mockingjay). I had trouble putting this book down when I had to do other things. I finally set aside a few hours one evening and finished this exciting trilogy.<br /><br />The book is better than the first movie (Hunger Games), but the movie did a good job of capturing the essentials of the story. The other movies are yet to come. You get a lot more of the story in the book, like explanations of why certain things are the way they are or done a certain way that you don't get explanations for in the movie.<br /><br />Hunger Games is required reading in some high schools. I wish we had something this interesting to have to read when I was in high school! This is much more interesting than War and Peace or the Scarlet Letter!
0804165734|2.0|It has been a chore to get through this book.  I was excited to listen to the audio, and the beginning I thought was good.  I was excited for what was to come!  Except what came were uninteresting characters with uninteresting stories, which is saying a lot since they survived a Zombie Apocalypse.<br /><br />There were a handful of interesting stories - the blind Japanese man, the Asian computer teen, the Australian, and the doctor for Patient 0.  No one else sticks out to me as having an interesting story.  I was sorry when those above ended, and longed for more details on those characters.<br /><br />Few movies can deviate from a book so much and be far more superior.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and am disappointed that the book lacked any development or story.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This is a fun sci-fi book. The characters are stuck in a Star-Trek like TV series but don't realize it at first. they travel back in time to meet the writer of the series and get him to make some changes so that the characters don't die. It's more complicated than that, but it's a fun read! There is a free sample version of this book with just chapters 1-4 if you want to give it a try.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cant wait for the next addition. This is a good skill level game. Fun for all levels of players. Some of the objects are a chalange. Level ten is flustrating. But worth it!!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|This is a good movie but it is not the Trek most of us grew up with. Abram's determination to wipe the previous universe out except for names continues but that being said it is a good movie, just not Star Trek as we know it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Awesome I love this game, I am totally addicted! I just wish the walls stayed up longer! But overall it's a really fun game.
B0051E9INK|4.0|Truth be told, I was a Highlander fan and then I lived in Scotland for a few years and now the two of them are inextricably linked. I love them both!
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|If you're a fan of the band this is for you, I have been listening to this nonstop for the past week.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are really worth the buy! Shipping is also very fast! When I bought these three books I bought them on a Tuesday and got them the following Wednesday. Well worth it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Couldn't put this game down. Pretty addicting! Had really good graphics &amp;&amp;Definitely worth the money. I want the next one to come out!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book inspired me and helped me realise that I took a lot for granted and this was a amazing book that made me cry at times but made me laugh I wish I was August Pullman friend but I know that  have great friends just like him (not in the outside) but in The inside. Any way I definitely would recommend this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was a challenging game, but i made it through all 10 levels within 24 hours. it was an awesome game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is truly the best app ever. Even MOSI has it so for all you people out there who don't know what to do all I have to say is....BUY IT NOW SMASH THAT BUTON NOW BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!
B004VDL826|5.0|Without dissecting the plot, Motoko has left Section 9, and her interaction here reminded me of Innocence; you idealize over her short appearances, and end up reeled closer to her than ever by the end. There's also less action, with more character bonding and a more mysterious plot to engage the brain.<br /><br />There was a pretty big time lapse between me watching the series and this &#34;sequal&#34;, but Solid State Society starts as fast, if not faster paced and awesome than where it left off. The intro, even the title menu will get you pumped and grinning like a school boy/girl.<br /><br />Huge contributor to that was the OST; a lot has been recycled from the series, but this is by no means a bad thing. I believe GitS' OSTs to be the most provoking, adaptive and beautiful i've heard (NGE is up there too).<br /><br />As I clicked play, I was metaphorically slapped in the face; I was passively watching the show while doing a few other house activities. You can't simply let GitS roll in the background and expect to comprehend it without dedicating your full attention.<br /><br />And as always, the english cast is phenominal.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />-Phenominal dub<br />-Beautiful OST<br />-Story line twists that will leave your head spinning even after the credits start rolling<br />-That faint romantic tension (it's not just me right?) between Motoko and (maybe Batou, or maybe some urge she just hasn't fulfilled yet in life. I haven't pinpointed it.)<br />-Must buy for a fan of any degree
B00991TCOG|5.0|Great cd! Anyone who likes violin or good music will really like it! Each song is very unique and has a dubstep/electronic backing so it makes it very modern. I like anti gravity and zi zis journey the best but they are all so good to listen to! Never skip a track. Buy it now!
B00AYM6JFO|4.0|Pretty good -- much better than his last few albums, not as good as his music from the 70's and 80's.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this really cool game gives me puzzels for myself to solve. it also helps me memorize numbers and colors. I will tell someone to play ir
B003629IPW|5.0|The products I ordered, arrived in good condition and they are working.  I don't know that there is anything more to say.but thank you !!!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The new format started two days ago and I cannot stand it.  I can 't even figure out how to delete locations when I no longer need them.  As the old saying goes, &quot;If it is not broken ----don't fix it!&quot;
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|When I finally get a chance to sit and take a break,  I pick up my Kindle and play Jewels Star.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I've been playing for over a month and this game is great and rewarding!  Constantly challenging and allows you to progress and get rewarded for it.  Easy to pick up and play as well as continually improve your skills - the best of both the recreational and more hardcore games.
B005KDWUG4|5.0|They are the best there is.  Did not wont the singing to come to an end.  Looking forward to their next DVD.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Usually apps like this on the kindle fire are not the best quality, but this is an amazing version for the kindle.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm so glad I was able to get season 3.  I must admit; first I went to NetFlix but they only had season 1 and I had already seen it.  Plus they were discontinuing it anyway.  Then I went to Hulu and they only had seasons 1 & 2 which, again, I had already seen.  I just needed to find season 3 and you guys had it and I was thrilled!!!  I blew through it and now I'm all caught up and can't wait for season 4 which begins in January 2014.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!  You guys have EVERYTHING!!!
B009AMAGQM|5.0|okay I am sure if I had read the book I would have been disappointed because you always are if you read the book first on most all movies. I really liked this movie. My daughter enjoyed it and we watched it together a couple of times. I think to be able to watch a movie and not feel like you want to shoot yourself after you watch it is nice. I have a son as well and all to many times we go to the movies and it is all about people killing each other and have sad endings or about zombies and the world ending (not saying I don't enjoy them but). It is nice to have a nice story and yes even a love story ever once in awhile to offer an escape from real life. I will eventually buy it when it drops in price. I am learning to wait a little while to buy the blurays because they always go down in price if you just wait a little bit of time.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|The opening scene -riddled with obscenities - the rest of the more more of the same - nice plot but really!!!!
B008LV8TSU|5.0|The ending was predictable, but I would have been disappointed if it had ended any differently.  I especially liked how Ms. Jones created flaws in Howl, but still made him appealing.  I would recommend this book to lovers of fantasy and good stories.
B0019IB0II|4.0|I read this book because I had recently had a stroke myself.  Although hers was hemorrhagic and mine was ischemic, there were some similarities and I think it is helpful to know what the symptoms really feel like.  Many people will have a stroke in their lifetimes and it is good to know what to look for and that you can survive it. I thought the book was well worth reading.
B005C8ENI0|2.0|Cannot watch this film in HD on a computer, only on the Kindle Xbox 360 or the ps3...and I am a Prime member.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun that you can't stop playing.<br />Also its a mixture of crazy and fun.<br />I like the game but I have a problem...  CAN'T STOP PLAYING
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great game if you like solving puzzles. Even my seven year old son enjoys playing this game.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|It's a good book to read when you really need to feel humble, although it can be very repetitive.<br />Definitely worth the read through.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Phenomenal book. If you ever had any interest in D&D, the 80s, video games, MMOs, or want an interesting look into the near future, you have to check this book out.
0061122416|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much! I read it in a couple of hours so I would definitely recommend it.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I was unsure about this series at first but I gave it a chance and now I'm hooked. Don't miss out on a great show.
1440503257|5.0|This is an amazing must have but for any Harry Potter fan!! I am so glad I bought this, definitely worth the price!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Like that there is options for background and cards. Gives hints and has an undo button. Really can't go wrong with this little game.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I downloaded a heat monitor before I put it on; after I cleaned and put the AS 5 on the CPU is about 8 degrees cooler under load.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is awesome,I don't get tired of it because it is so fun to play my little brother loves it!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is just a great series giving us a taste of what it was like before & post WWI. The only negative is some political correctness that would not have been part of the 1930s.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I enjoy the game. Just wish the other versions were free. All in all, it's a good job by g5.
0517543052|5.0|Be Here Now has many reminders of how to live a positive that apply just as much now as in the '70s. Quick shipping too.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I do like this app. Its only down side is that you need bling to get certain stuff.  I would get it but you have to buy things sometimes
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I really love this series.  Creative and innovative in the storytelling.  Can wait to see how it all turns out.
B00D78J7SI|5.0|Children of bodem have been around for awhile and they have done a lot of exceptional albums over the years And this is no exception.  Really great stuff, halo of blood, and transference are my personal favorites on this album, so if you don't know if you want the full album, start with those.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Waiting for the third  book of the Clifton Chronicles!  A real cliff hanger at the end of the book!  I enjoy all of his books!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app but the other Day it stopped working and i get notifications saying i have 18 messages :(
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The story line, although somewhat unlikely, is absorbing, and certainly has some unexpected, surprising twists!  It will make you wonder how you would behave if in these situations.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The story line for Gideon and Eva is so AWWWW!!!<br />I could not put the book down, started reading as soon as possible and stayed up until 3AM to finish the book. The twist and turns in their story keep you interested and involved. I wish I could find my Gideon....<br />I cannot wait to read #4.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Many sites that I would like to get info from come with pdf docs so this app helps when using my Kindle Fire HD. I can read my docs clear and with ease.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this app a lot it's  everything is big and I lot that a lot unlike using my phone
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|An unbelievable story that deserves to be told over and over. I couldn't put it down. It is an incredibly wonderful read.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I use this daily. today I opened the app. all my saved locations are gone. cannot find my local weather. full of ads. there is also a \\"present\\" icon and awards points and a bunch of stuff I don't need.  I want the weather -  simple, easy.  Won't be using this I'm deleting it
B00499QUK2|5.0|Benedict Cumberbqtch and Martin Freeman have amazing chemistry! They play off each other in a way that is great to watch. Each episode is almost like watching a short movie series and I could not get enough!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I was sorry to see the book end, hopefully he will have the next in line out soon.  The whole John Corey series is great.  The one liners will make you laugh out loud.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|If you like temple run you will most likely enjoy this game as well. I used to be addicted to temple run 2 now I have a new game addiction
B000YKG5IC|1.0|This is a 5 star album easy, however, this download has obnoxiously low volume.  Do NOT buy this, choose another version.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Fantastic truth...thankful that the Navy allowed this to be published. The liberal media and rules of engagement for our troops need to take a hard look at their 'truths'. We are blessed to have men like this willing to risk it all so we can have freedom.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I have always enjoyed the series and thought our local library would benefit from my donation.  I hope others will enjoy it too.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I love a book that I can't lay down or gives me that contradicting feeling of being hardly able to wait to get to the end but at the same time, not wanting to see it end. &#34;ZERO DAY&#34; was one of those stories. It has a couple of twists in it that are independent of each other and you will think you have this one all figured out but I guarantee you, you don't! It is most definitely edge of your seat excitement and I love the character John Puller. I hope to read more about him in the near future!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I liked the first season of the series and thought our local library would benefit from my donation. Great series.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game love the clean graphics.  Highly recommend this game.  Great time passer. That's all for now. Thank you for reading my review.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|So handy to have! and easy to use.  What a great app when you need to know what the weather going is going to do hours in advance and right now.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is GREAT. Lots to do and keeps changing. I enjoy the missions. I even play with my mom and she loves it too.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Once I got over that this book wasn't a fairytale I loved it. It's realistic it definitely got a slow in the middle but it picks right back up!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's an amazing app for me and my little brother we pretty much love on this app but what should change is being able to work for gems.
B000P0J09W|5.0|Great movie for kids & adults. Clean fun. Actual story and plot, not like the junk movies rushed out today.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|You get exactly what you would expect from a game with this title.  Runs great on my kindle fire HD. I would recommend this game to people who like defense games.
0345803485|5.0|i read it 3x and recommended it to all my friends. Even my mom read it. We all loved it.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I used this book to mainly improve my social relationships with women, but it has improved my social relationships; period! If you have trouble socializing with people, I highly recommend you read this book
0345803493|5.0|I read it 3 times and I recommemmended it to all my friends. We all loved it. Even my mom loved it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I always closes when I try to use it it goes to universal and puts me back at home screen
0345803507|5.0|I read it 3 times and I recommended it to all my friends they loved it and even my mom loved it.
0544139453|5.0|Superb writing.  Fascinating use of monologue .  Informative in the way of presenting two cultures -<br />America's and Pakistan's.  Had elements of suspense.  Held my attention through reading.
B0038NN3B4|3.0|i think the narrative on the book is great, however it was a waste of money having the book on an e reader.there is no way to read the recipes properly...next time I will buy a hard book
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game.  The levels are challenging but not so hard you just give up.  Would recommend this game to everyone.!!  Can't wait to play more.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Lots of action - holds your interest. Worth the time and of course all the actors are great. Get it.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I bought the Perplexus Epic for a 6 year old niece who just love it,<br />at first bewildered by it, then it had been a non stop pleasure to play<br />with it. I recommend it for anyone that wants to make a different and<br />entertaining gift for a 6 year old child.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|i love this movie the fashion is great, the attitudes r intense, the actors r spectacular and it is just a really funny movie
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the typical solitaire game that I grew up with and I still love it and now I can play it on my kindle and pass the time where ever I am<br />:) :)
B002O5M4SA|5.0|I loved it, however I made the mistake on not order the international version. Which I reordered. I wanted to see  the director's cut. To see if it made a difference.
085720873X|5.0|Vince Flynn does (did?) not let his readers down. Mitch Rapp is one of the most incredible heroes ever! I will miss Flynn's books and the adventures of CIA spy Mitch Rapp. Maybe Daniel Silva can try his hand at writing Rapp sequels since his Mosad hero is the Israeli version of Mr. Rapp.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The series has been a non-stop source of entertainment, and season 3 just increases the excitement!  Love the intermingling of emotional highs and lows, and the constant human interactions and machinations.  Just as in real life, no one person is all good or all bad, nor are their lives all happy or all sad.<br />Visually, the series is a feast for the eyes, from the Abbey itself to the grounds, to the costumes and to the actors and actresses.  I can't wait for season 4, coming in January, 2014!  I am totally, completely hooked!
B004LAIU4I|3.0|I purchased this for my father for his birthday, as he asked for it, and he seems to enjoy it. I've listened to all the tracks, and well, this is not the Simon I know and love. It's no Graceland -- the writing is a bit cheesy for me, the instrumental work is not up to par, and the rhythm, which used to be Simon's mainstay, is, in my opinion, just OK.<br /><br />Definitely give a listen to the samples from the tracks before you buy this one, so you know what you're getting into!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|The game itself is a clever take on the old standby; it has a number of options and can be a lot of fun. The problem is that when bugs surface, fixes are a long time coming, if at all. Perhaps because I am not a Facebook player, I get initial assurances to my reports that efforts are being made to resolve the problem and then silence as weeks/months go by without the fix. I'm losing interest in the interim and may just uninstall the app. Too bad; I thought it had potential.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am addicted to this game I am only writing this review to keep playing overall this is a good game
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great game. Keeps you interested.Also some great puzzles.The storyline is good.I like the bonus game ending. Is hard to put down.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|joyfilled with wonderful performances!<br />thank you very much- would love to see the show again soon- what a cast- wow
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Dexter is a great show!  It always leaves you wanting more. The writer's are good at making it appear there is no way out and Dexter always comes out on top.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you are a fan of love stories with non stop passion, this is the book series for you. This book series did not disappoint me I could not put it down !!!!!!!!!!!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|would be lost witho ut it....would not be able to successfully use any of my kindles ,I have a  spare in the car
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|the reson i love it is because you get to make the birds fly in the sky and i think that that is so funny
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|This is one addicting game. Do not hesitate to give this game a chance. I love it and cannot put it down!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really cool game ! It's lots of fun for everyone. It's almost like temple run just better.
B009G41CG2|4.0|I like this game. It has proved to be a bit more challenging that some of the others I have played. If you like Mahjong, you will love this game.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|It is the usual angry birds format.  Not my favorite game, but for the eight year old.  He loves it.  Keeps him quietly entertained for awhile and makes us all happy.<br /><br />However, you may loose your Kindle from time to time....when the kids want to play this game.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Has everything you'd want in a interactive mystery puzzle. Good story. Wonderful graphics. Great puzzles. Nice set up. Moreover,  the length of playing time equals your money's worth. Alawar really knows how to produce a good one for this genre.
B0052OSTOS|5.0|Another great product from Meditation Oasis.  I own several apps from this company and they are all high quality, reasonably prices and do exactly as advertised.  Easy to use, programmable and high sound quality.  I highly recommend any of their meditation apps.  The normally cost a lot less than most similar apps and are just as good if not better.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I thought it would just be a dumb teen romance, but it was kind of funny and cute.  I hate to admit I enjoyed it.  Check it out
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Now that I have had time to digest the book, I am less impressed. I'm glad I read it so that I can speak to it, should it come up in conversation. I wish it had some kind of message, something that I could have learned from it. The book is an excellent testament to the kind of people we are becoming.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|The trailer pretty much tells the story.  No surprises and nothing original IMHO.  Movies are subjective though, so you may like it.
0425238091|5.0|I've bought this books 4 times before but didn't get it back after lending it out.  Now I've got my 5th copy and am enjoying reading it again.  It has been called the second most important piece of medical fiction ever written (Number one being &#34;Arrowsmith&#34;).
B0091REZMW|4.0|If I had access to money...this game would be way more fun...but alas,  I'm broke,  and that just makes it somewhat frustrating.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is really fun, but after a little bit of playing the game froze and I had to restart my kindle fire,and when I tried.to play it again, it would take me back to the home screen.
0425238091|5.0|House of God is insightful and comical. Reading it as at veterinary student, I felt I got a lot out of it. Also passed it on to my dad, and he's loving it as well!
B005LAIGRS|4.0|An up to date Cold War Thriller with Washington playing a CIA turncoat who starts the ball rolling by escaping a group of gunman by turning himself into an American Embassy. This occurs after the first spate of gunfire has opened the film. From the Embassy the gunfire is  picked  up in the CIA Safe House and nothing is settled for the remainder of the picture. As usual, Washington carries the heavy load of an Established Star; as usual, he does so with style and flair. It is a strong cast and, together with the Star, they put on a show which never flags. Will the CIA relatively newcomer to the Business, bring in Washington and return him to American custody? Will either or both of them live what with being surrounded (it often seems) by an army of gunmen out to get Washington at all costs? What about the host country, will there be an International Incident over the affair? The film carried me along with it, no flagging of interest, to the very end.  For those who like thrillers, this is a good one, indeed.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This show runs through the story without the normal stalling in order to get to fill the standard 22 episode order.<br />Tatiana Manslany is absolutely fantastic.<br />All the characters are fleshed out with real qualities (some good, some bad).<br />Plus, it's just great fun to explore the nature vs nurture questions presented in genetics.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a fun show.  I hope the second season is as entertaining!  Cute people, interesting story line, and something both my husband and I enjoyed watching.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I really do think this is the finest portrayal of Jane Austen's character, Emma.  Much better than all the others.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Personaly, i liked the first one better however, this sequil isn't half bad. As in the first one, you get the shoot em up action hero stuff with a full action hero cast. If you did not enjoy the first one then do not bother watching this one as you will not like it either. If you liked the first one then you should like this one too.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is just what I needed! Sharp image with great function, who could ask for anything more from a free app!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James Altucher has a style all his own. It is unique and refreshing writing. This book will for sure have parts that resonate with you better than others, but it has lots of great gems. If you do the 10 ideas a day habit for a while, that itself can have dramatic effects on your life.
B00A7Q814Y|5.0|The complete symphonies of such famous composers as Mozart and Beethoven and many more. The collection was well worth the money spent.
0307341577|4.0|This novel is not for the faint at heart.  I love the writing style of Gillian Flynn.  This is the second novel I have read from this author, the first being Girl Gone which was good but this one is even better.  Their are so many different layers to this story about a little 7 year old girl name Libby Day who witnessed her family being murdered.  The characters in this book are not the most likable and that's fine by me.  When I read a good book,I don't have to relate to any characters I just want to be entertained.  Also I love a book that's not predictable and keep you on your toes.  Great job Ms Flynn.  I look forward to your next book.
B002YDRA22|5.0|Great director who has created a very entertaining movie based on a true story. We loved it. Music was great in the second half of the movie.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Great book.  I highly recommend it!  My son had me read it and it was worth it! Read them all!
B009UNH0EM|5.0|The Voyager Legend is 110% the very Bluetooth I have purchased in many years. 3 of my friend have purchased them as well for the clarity of hearing and speaking. Now, I purchased the additional chargers so I would enclose one in my suitcase, one in each vehicle and one at work. But, do worry about the battery life. Battery life last forever. When it’s fully charged, it will last 7 hours. Again, it last forever and now with chargers everywhere I might be, charging is a snap.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I wasn't expecting this to be a gateway to the fourth book, I was not impressed. I have a hard time seeing myself buying the next book.
B000K7VHSM|5.0|Its open, unforced depiction of love between two men made Brokeback an instant cultural touchstone, for both good and bad, as it was tagged derisively as the &#34;gay cowboy movie,&#34; but also heralded as a breakthrough for mainstream cinema
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I was not expecting this show to be as well written as it is.<br />Entertaining,Funny, Intelligent.<br /><br />Well Done! Highly Recommend
0345529057|5.0|This is truly an amazing investment. I don't understand why people are giving 1 star reviews to this paperback sets. I tend not to be a fan of this type of paperback form but I am truly happy with the quality of the books which is usually not expected when they come in mass paperback form.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|i loved this movie.
B0081I08CI|4.0|The second book to the series is truly an excellent installment. There are some chapters that were a bore but for the most part it works as a great bridge to what is in store for the third book.
B009RH9FR6|3.0|Did not spend a lot but not so great. Does not consistanly send device to sleep when closing case and it wakes up even though closed with elastic. The stand feature does not work well.  Either the indentations are too shallow or the protrusions that go into them are not long enough. In any case, it falls off the stand easily. Easily doubles the weight and size of the device. Spend more and get a better product.
0553582038|4.0|A Feast for Crows is not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. It is definitely isn't the type of book expected to follow quite an explosive book as A Storm of Swords was. Granted, a lot of the chapters in this book were mostly forgetful and I might have to get my mind refreshed on certain details here and there but there are subtle moments where it gets interesting if not very revealing for a \\"calmed down\\" book like this.<br /><br />A lot of the events were mostly set up for the next book and I'm sure it will definitely pay itself off.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is really awesome and everyone should buy it! Great for people of all ages. Especially horse lovers!!! GET THIS APP!!!!
0553381709|5.0|Wow. There are no words to describe how amazing this book was. The Red Wedding truly left me in such shock that I did stop reading the book for almost a week because I couldn't move on with it. It was definitely a roller coaster of emotion this book.
034580404X|5.0|I wrote a bad review on this a few days ago.. I would like to retract now... I did finally receive my books in perfect condition! They were quite late arriving but better late than never i would say! I look forward to reading the series.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|i voted 1 star only cos this game may start as a good idea, but it's terrible.<br />What ruins it are the commands that are not practical and the graphic which is terrible.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Very interesting read. It literally transported me into the book i found it interesting never read anything like this .
B005NKGEP2|3.0|I read the book because Marilyn Stasio mentioned it in the New York Times Book Review some time ago. And it was fine.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|It was awesome the 1st time around and continues to ROCK!<br />If you liked the original Stargate SG1 show you are going to love this.
B0017VG66I|5.0|I love western movies, especially the old ones like these two. Shane is, if not my favorite western movie, is in the top five. Alan Ladd, Jean Arther and Van Heflin were great. And the showdown gun fight with Jack Palance does not disappoint. Then the classic \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\\" is a typical John Ford movie with John Wayne, Jimmie Stuart, Lee Marvin, Vera Miles, etc. A great, fantastic pair of movies you'll watch over and over.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I didn't know if I would like this app or not. But I can honestly say it has helped me a lot. I am now very glad that I got it for my kindle fire hd. Easy to use!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I first played it on Facebook and when I saw it here I knew that I had to play it on my Kindle.  It sometimes hangs, but it seems to keep track of your game play so you don't lose points and experience.
B001AQQR2S|4.0|Talk about using your imagination! This movie is every kids (& parents) dream of using your &#34;magical&#34; powers. Have to see it.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|I am so mad at myself to have not known that this was such a great movie and it's been out since 2007. I couldn't think of no one else that could have pulled this off with so much finesse as my honey Wahlberg...Ahhh! Let me tell you something...you are doing your own self a disservice by not having it in your collection. This movie is addictive.... LOVE IT! There need to be a sequel.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|I have a hard time finishing books in general and with this book I am almost through it for the second time, because it is so interesting.  A must read for someone wanting to improve their memory!!
B003UESJHO|5.0|This movie was really great. All the characters blended well for the perfect mix. It couldn't have been what is was without every element: Christian Bale, Mark Wahlberg, Amy Adamns and the lady that portrayed the mother. Mark Wahlberg was great but Christian Bale was excellent.  The movie teaches many life lessons to be learned by everyone. Mark Wahlberg's best work since the SHOOTER which was a great movie as well. A must have for all Wahlberg fans like myself.
B009OA57MI|4.0|some crashes but good of landing on carriers and airbase<br />you can make your own island my favorite<br />jet is the 1000 knot one
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|The stark reality of the atrocities of the holocaust are brought to light But the individual bravery of a few who risked everything to save those who were otherwise doomed is expressed with passion. This is a fantastic movie about a very rare man who had a passion for human life, no matter what the prejudices of his society were.
B005HSL626|3.0|The game is ok but it get boring after only two rounds. I haven't had any problems with it though.
B000FC12SM|4.0|I've been failing miserably at relationships for years.  This book has really opened my eyes to many of my flaws as well as misinterpretations of other people's words and actions. This book had already been very useful for my work relationships and friendships. I hope it's content will be just as valuable in my next personal relationship.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this app. The only thing is when I try to play it while my kindle is charging it kinda freaks out. It is otherwise fine. I like it better than the first temple run.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I liked this game. I love this app. I would download again. It's great fun and easy to use for all ages.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|I love how Hosseini weaves different characters' lives together into one giant story. With his use of words I can clearly see the characters and the streets of Kabul.  Even though the stories are heartbreaking, I want to read more.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Wow best game I ever had on my tablet but stuff is expensive like the guns but great game 5 star all day long
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|My children and I did not care for this app. Toca Boca hair salons are much better. If everything had been unlocked we have have liked it better. Plus when you 'grab' an item it doesn't line up with your finger or stylus on the touch screen. My children kept 'dropping' items. It wasn't our touch screen, its all the games put out by this company.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|This book was amazing and at first it was slow paved but towards the end I couldn't stop reading. I can't wait to begin the next book in this series. Good job Scott Westerfield!
0316247545|4.0|I just wish it had more commentary. The commentary stops when the section covering all the episodes kicks in. It would have been a good time for the cast to talk about each episode.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I thought this would just be another Robin Hood movie, but I'm a movie lover so I bought it.  The story actually precedes the Robin Hood we usually see and tells how Robin and Marian met.  Rather a new twist and I liked it.

Not only is the story fabulous, the writer has captured everything that could be left to the imagination. I am anxiously awaiting another book by Carolyn Bennet! Great job! This book made me dream about it and I actually woke in a sweat. lol Love the scare factor!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amazing! Perfect for a long car ride or when you have extra free time during the day.
0345803485|1.0|I put down the book after Anastasia referred to Christian's penis as her own \\"Christian Grey flavored popsicle.\\" I just couldn't take it anymore. I turned away, mourning for the state of popular literature in modern society.<br /><br />Obviously I share in all the usual complaints about this book. Christian is unrealistically perfect, Ana is an insipid, lip-biting mess of a main character, the sex scenes sound like they were written by a 16 year old boy, etc. But I want to add one thing: both the plot and characters in Fifty Shades of Grey are horribly inconsistent. Take Ana for example: one chapter she's innocent and clumsy, completely uninterested in men, next she's happily sucking away at her \\"popsicle\\" and riding the big \\"O's\\" like she'd been doing it since birth. I simply cannot believe such an instantaneous change from stereotypical bookworm to BSDM slave. Then there's Christian, the perfect, polished man with the hidden \\"black knight\\" lust for kinky sex. He tries to come across all stoic and hard hearted, telling Ana he doesn't make love but instead \\"f***s hard,\\" but ten minutes later he's caressing her in bed, talking about how she's \\"his.\\" It seems like the author just changes the characters' personalities as she sees fit, and it bothered me.<br /><br />Don't read this. Really not worth your time. Seriously...
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|The is the most extraordinary and wonderful movie I have ever seen. The story, cinematography and music are all stunning. Do yourself a favor by watching The Fall.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I have to say that Ken Follett is an excellent storyteller.  He does a great job of bringing readers into the story.  Overall this is a very good book.  However, I have to mention this in case someone is thinking of letting their young teens or older teens for that matter read it.  I'm not necessarily a prude, but am definitely not a fan of trashy romance novels with descriptive love scenes.  I checked into this book before I read it to make sure it wasn't anything like that, and found this on the author's site:<br /><br />  \\" Is the sexual content of your books suitable for young teenagers?<br /><br />  Yes.  In my stories, having sex is usually a moral decision with consequences for people and families.\\"<br /><br />This is not the case at all.  In addition to several uses of the F*** word, Love scenes in Fall of Giants are VERY descriptive describing every single action and body part in detail.  I am an adult who can easily skip over such things, but this book is in no way appropriate for minors.  I would have given 5 stars if not for that.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|This is Hollywood introducing new stars. The story line was ridiculous and predictable. Only watch if you are desperate and have nothing else to watch.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Entertaining and historical. A great read for the beach....beware of the strange looks you will get for the laugh out loud moments.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|just like the real thing I would recommend this game for kids and adults realistic. and fun this app has enough money for you to buy the things you want then to earn the stuff you need
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Not the kind of person who usually watches this kind of stuff, but this is awesome, I watched all the episodes in one sitting, Loved it.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Another Dan Brown novel with the same template, same characters in a different venue.  If you are a Brown fan, you'll enjoy this book.  If you have never read Brown, this book will  be fun.  Otherwise it's just very Okay!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|great movie and very fun to watch! highly recommend it for all ages. cant wait to watch part 2 !
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I ran it on a Kindle Fire HD to analyze settings for a new WiFi 802.11ac network in my home. Works like a champ! Specially liked the display of other WiFi networks in the area so I can select channels for my network that avoids interference from my neighbors' WiFi networks while maximizing reception in all areas of the house. Easy to use, easy to understand. A really nice little app!
1594745692|5.0|The set (cards and book) came in a very timely manner (well before the scheduled arrival date). They are really creative and a totally different, unique way of doing tarot card readings. Each card is well designed and very zombie-esque, the book is clever, and even the box it all comes in is a great display piece. I'm very happy with my purchase!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this was an exciting book held my interest throughout. would recommend to friends, can't wait to read the next one.
0553801473|4.0|I got this through a third party person and the copy was in good condition. I can't wait for the next book in the series! Darned cliffhangers. Oh, but the dragons don't really dance. They do other fun stuff, however.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|Really like all the info provided by this app, including synonyms, and how they're used. Good for writers! Also like having the encyclopedic info wrapped in with the dictionary.  A real bargain!
B003INBOEM|5.0|If you only ever watch one Donnie Yen film, watch this one. Granted, I love a good martial arts movie but this beats all others I've seen. The techniques are impressive and the story is captivating. Donnie Yen is a master of his craft and a wonderful actor. Everyone else was good, too.
B004XCUEU2|4.0|In recent years, I've watched several of these documentaries that provide a chronological history of how some of the great bands were created.  Certainly with rock bands, the formula is pretty much the same.  Long before you've ever heard of a band, their members struggled or were successful on a local or regional level.  While musicianship is critical, chemistry between band mates is primary.  You learn that if you can't work with others, you will likely be gone.<br /><br />I could have laid this doc on top of the new one about The Eagles and you wouldn't have much of a difference.  After the death of Curt Cobain came the death of Nirvana.  After several months, drummer Dave Grohl decides to move on by writing his own songs and playing a guitar.  After releasing an early FF album in which he plays all the instruments, he decides to tour, but needs a band.  First a trio then a quartet, the band goes through the requisite changes.<br /><br />It is Grohl's band.  He will write the music and he will make all the decisions.  Some are fine with this, others are not.  This isn't a democracy.  Grohl, as you might expect is front and center and is very smart and very articulate.  He makes for a good story teller.  Every member is featured including those who were fired.  Some were surprised and remain bitter.  Like most documentaries of this ilk, we hear nothing of what being on the road is like.  Other than it is tiring.  No mention of the women, the sex.  The only drug reference is Taylor Hawkins well chronicled overdose in England.  We also hear nothing from the wives or family members that may have had an impact along the way.  I guess the juicy stuff only comes in the written biographies.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|I have the feeling that this is a &#34;love it or what?&#34; kind of film. My husband and I both love it and think its so funny! We've shown it to most of our friends and they're often left going, &#34;That was weird.&#34;
B00DNUSFWE|5.0|This is the second of the classics restored by Universal in their monster collection and it is a gem of course. I don't know how many times I've seen this great movie, but this Blu ray is certainly the highest quality. Given a serious look, it's not quite the perfect horror movie I have forever thought but it's still close. The best thing here is Boris Karloff, as Dr. Frankenstein's creation. Watch his near mute (he does grunt and growl) performance. Like many of the silent films a few years earlier, actors have to use their movement, their eyes and facial expression to communicate feelings. And Karloff is masterful in this performance. Can't say enough about him.<br /><br />Troubled actor Colin Clive is also excellent as Frankenstein. Dwight Frey as Fritz and Edward Van Sloan return after their similar performances in \\"Dracula.\\" The story of course is based on an early 19th century story by Mary Shelley. All of this wouldn't have happened of course but for some great direction from James Whale and masterful makeup from Jack Pierce. So what's wrong? Quibbles admittedly but still.<br /><br />First when the monster is on the loose on day of the doc's wedding to lovely Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), Frankenstein thinks he hears the monster inside the house. He gathers a search party of staffers and locks Elizabeth in her room \\"to keep her safe.\\" Say what? Of course, the creature enters though an open window. Then there is the issue of the little Maria (Marilyn Harris) who is playfully tossed into the lake by her cottage by the creature. Fortunately this once censured scene was rightfully restored. Her father finds the girl (off camera) and marches into the village carrying her dead body claiming she had been murdered. Huh? Couldn't she just have drowned on her own? And why didn't he teach her how to swim anyway? Great sets, especially the flowing electricity in the laboratory, excellent acting and a timeless story overcome any shortcomings.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer comes in 1080p resolution with a 1.35:1 aspect ratio.  While perhaps not quite as sharp as \\"Dracula\\" the film is as good as its ever been.  The original photography is well represented with little to complain about in terms of flicker, specks, and other video crud.  If anything the picture appears a little too dark on rare occasion.  These are minor picked nits and of little consequence.  The audio comes courtesy of DTS-HD Master Audio Mono (2-channel) and while it is very good it does seem a bit noisier than the aforementioned \\"Dracula.\\"  I don't know if this is the transfer or the condition of the original material.  In any case, most will not notice.  Here are the extras:<br /><br />*The Frankenstein Files: How Hollywood Made a Monster (45 minutes)<br />*Karloff: The Gentle Monster (38 minutes)<br />*Universal Horror (95 minutes)<br />*Audio Commentaries: Film historians Rudy Behlmer & Sir Christopher Frayling.<br />*100 Years of Universal: Restoring the Classics (9 minutes)<br />*Boo!: A Short Film (10 minutes)<br />*Frankenstein Archives (9 minutes)<br />*Trailer Gallery (8 minutes)<br />*Monster Trackses in 1080p resolution with a 1.35:1 aspect ratio.

B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie was a wonderful roller coster ride from the very beginning, with brilliant performances from some of the \\"older\\" actors of our generation. Not only did they prove in the movie they could still kick butt, they proved they still were excellent actors on the screen. I miss those that have died since this movie was made.
B00002SWEM|5.0|In 1997, well known guitarist Ry Cooder travelled to Havana in search of famed musicians who had worked the clubs in a pre-Castro era.  One of the great venues of a time that stretched from the 1930's to the 1950's was the Buena Vista Social Club.  He successfully recruited a group of aging musicians including a couple in their 90's.  The result was a Grammy winning album.<br /><br />Following up a couple years later was this documentary by German director Wim Wenders (\\"Paris Texas\\") with Cooder serving as a guide.  Perhaps surprisingly, the Cuban musicians had aged gracefully and played nearly well as they did in their hey-day.  The heart of the film lies in the individual stories of each artist.  Some remembering even touring in the U. S.  Yet, they knew little of the outside world, living on the crumbling island.  The aging Social Club itself now houses young gymnasts and dancers.<br /><br />Each of the featured performers is vibrant and interesting to listen to.  Cooder and his associates even get approval to take the ensemble on a brief tour, beginning in Amsterdam and ending up at Carnegie Hall, in New York City.  What a great night that must have been.  Wenders then follows the musicians as they tour Manhattan, bewildered as if they had just stepped on another planet.  What could have been.

B004SJ3BCI|1.0|This app is on of the worst if have ever used. Its levels are stressful as all of the birds seem to be morons and miss the target everytime. Also you can not ever shut down any apps made by this appmaker, they constantly run and kill your battery. DO NOT GET THIS HORIBLE APP!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoy all three seasons, and was so happy I got them free on Amazon Prime.  Amazon Prime is such a great addition to viewing.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|I must say I was disappointed with this read. It had great potential but fail flat. The beginning was full of promise, and really had my attention. But as the story unfolded it somehow lost its appeal. It went nowhere. The interest the protagonist showed was, in my opinion, unwarranted. I never made the connection, why was this relevent. I guess it's a okay read, however, I would not recommend this book, sorry.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved it. I read it without stopping.  Exciting story and well written. In a few more years I will read it again.
0062127241|5.0|It is great hearing from Pete.<br />Told from his pen, his viewpoint.<br />An amazing life he has lived.<br /><br />Come on the amazing journey<br />and learn all you should know.
1608871088|1.0|I was expecting a cohesive, lovely book, due to the glowing reviews I read.  This book struck me as an uneven hodgepodge of illustrations thrown together in haste to earn money due to the popularity of the movie.  I expected a mix of illustrations beginning with the concepts of the characters and ending with the finished characters.  Instead, this struck me as being a &#34;stew&#34; made up of contributors who may have had little to do with the finished product, but wanted to be included in the book. I am returning this book as I don't care to even look at it a second time.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This was a great purchase. I bought this for my daughter, and refer to this case as KatieProof. The phone case costs more than I normally pay for cases, but this proved to be a great deal. It was less expensive buying through Amazon than buying at a retail store. I have recommended to friends that they buy all of their phone accessories through Amazon.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Played this on iPod and purchased for my PC.  Very glad to see it for Kindle Fire. Worth the 99 cents to stop ads.  Best solitiare!!
B000W1TJOK|5.0|I am shocked at how few reviews there are of GOO.<br /><br />I consider Sonic Youth as the BEST band from the US that an be considered punk or grunge.<br /><br />Personally. I detest labels. I consider The Sex Pistols. the Damned, Ramones, The Clash and even Ministry & Skinny Puppy from the 1989 to 1992 as punk, but more importantly, Sonic Youth as great rock and roll !<br /><br />Goo - Sonic Youth blatantly tried to launch a radio friendly album. It was NOT a huge success. Here in Australia (Oz) e sa the singles, Kool Thing, Goo, Mary Christ on television. Wow .... on TV . Yes, it was very late on a National Program called _ Rage - that played a lot of what the US would call Alternative Rock.<br /><br />I recommend GOO as an  entry point into Sonic Youth. It is a grungy album that flows. It is a pop album I you don't like the hardcore sound a la Black Flag. The first three songs -  - are remarkable as they brilliantly lo into one another.<br /><br />Goo - was the predecessor to the Grunge explosion of 1991 to 1994. Unfortunately, Sonic Youth received little income and accolades from a movement that they pioneered. I saw a few Nirvana interviewed on early  where Kurt Cobain and Kris Novoselic tried to discuss Sonic Youth and their importance, but the interviewer was NOT interested. MTV did not consider Sonic Youth and their image or sound warm enough or any demographic.<br /><br />I don't care who you are but Sonic Youth are the best ever US punk/grunge rock band.  Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney, The Screaming Trees and Pearl Jam blatantly ripped them off.<br />Don't take my word for it, listen to Goo and then Nevermind and you will go, mmmmm,<br /><br />Once again, I consider Sonic Youth as the BEST band from the US that an be considered punk.<br /><br />5 STARS or a brilliant albu.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I was behind on an important project and I didn't think I would finish it in time.  So I thought I would give this a try.  It allowed me the freedom to work on it whenever I had a few minutes.  Not only did I finish on time, it was a presentation I was proud of.  I had no problems that others seemed to have.  I plan on using it a lot in the future.
030758836X|4.0|Despite the language (is it really necessary to use the f-word so often?), I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Suspenseful and well-written, Gone Girl is a real page turner. I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened next, but as I neared the last pages, I didn't want it to end. And then when I read the last word, I thought, \\"Huh? Is that it? Are we to believe that this couple is going to stay together? Or wait, maybe Amy has something up her sleeve. Or maybe the pair from the Ozarks will arrive and throw a monkey wrench into everything.\\"<br /><br />On the surface, the novel appears to be a boy-meets-girl story in which the characters are going to live happily ever after. They're both nice looking, educated, employed, and in love. But soon the reader learns that there's trouble in paradise and that things aren't always what they appear to be. They lose their jobs and move back to hubby's hometown to help care for his parents, her with cancer and him with Alzheimer's. That's when things really get interesting, and the reader doesn't know what to believe. Is Amy really an angel in disguise? Is Nick a cad? How can Amy be so callous in her thoughts about her parents, the people who have spent their adult lives writing about her and elevating her to fame?<br /><br />Gillain Flynn is masterful in creating such a suspenseful thriller. Seriously, up until the very last page the reader is wondering what's going to happen next. The scene setting, the character development, the plot twists, and the dialogue are all superb. I did wonder about a few things such as why no one listened to Desi's mother or what happened to Andie. Those are minor questions in the grand scheme of things, however.<br /><br />It's a powerful book, especially for those interested in the inner workings in the mind of a sociopath. You'll never see the people around you in the same way again, not even those whom you think you know best.
B000YABS8E|5.0|This comedy movie is a must see! Many laughs along with a great story line makes this comedy a real classic. It took me 20 minutes locating it here because I could not remember the title or anything. It is really worth it!
B007Y36K46|5.0|Don't let the box office numbers fool you, this was one of the best movies of 2012 and the best Science Fiction movie in a long time.  Think of Indiana Jones goes to Mars, it has adventure, action, mystery and romance.  It was a better movie than The Avengers and The Hunger Game, both of which came out last year.

B00005JPLW|5.0|Loved every sec of it! Things to remember: Honor is worth more than life. Death before Dishonor.<br />Everyone has a part to play, which part is up to you, how you influence others around you can make the difference between a traitor or a supporter.<br />Free men make a difference.  Sparta had 10-15 slaves per citizen. But all the kids from a slave or citizen were put to the test and had the choice to be a citizen . A slave was the result of poverty or loss of a battle.  No one got a free ride.  Women held same status, but had different duties.  And not all men were warriors but all were expected to defend the home state as well as the women.  Said to be the first true Communistic society by some historians.  Yes if you mean that everyone worked for the better of the City State.  But that's a far cry from what's considered communist today.  Think more toward a very close nit combat unit.  Everyone ether was a warrior or supported the warrior.  The warrior was how Sparta got goods resources labor and status.

B005IQZB14|2.0|This book touched my soul. Although I am a senior, reading this memoir made me want to get out of my comfort zone and test my limits. I give it 5 stars.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The constant twists and turns of the plot in this series along with the fantastic characters and actors makes this one of our favorites.  We watch it all the time and even often re-watch episodes to explore the dynamics we may have missed the first time.  The entire plot line seems so well planned with tiny expressions and innuendos in one episode exploding into full story lines in later episodes.<br /><br />Loyalty, ethics, motivation, love and friendship are all elements woven in expertly into this show.<br />We totally enjoy it.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|I think the title I've put says it all.  Though written in the '60s, it still has major political and religious application today.

B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This is a great game loved the graphics and updated the free one so I can do the whole game hope to c more like it the hidden objects were well hide keep up the great game p
B00632HWOG|2.0|I liked the old Yahoo better.  I am thinking of changing my my mail that is how upset I am with the new Yahoo.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|I had this game thinking that it would be like the game but not let you have some stuff cause you know its a demo, yeah well think again it gives you like two monies and then tells you you have to buy the game. other than the dumbest rule ever its great
B00BU2SIW4|4.0|Not bad, but it did not have the elemental magic Depeche Mode contributes to the listener.<br />Not crazy about Delta Machine, but the album is quite good and still has the Depeche Mode foundation and songwriting style of the band.<br />Depeche Mode in terms of artistic atmosphere is still a musical titan from the 80s paving and destroying other electronic dinosaurs.<br />I am very happy they are still in the game.<br />Check the machine: [[ASIN:B00BU2SIW4 Delta Machine (Deluxe)]]
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Hopefully AMD continues to improve these APUs. I built a mini-itx workstation using the A10 and am incredibly happy with it given its price vs performance. The built on GPU isn't going to play the latest and greatest games but it easily outperforms anything intel has to offer in the integrated GPU department.<br /><br />Incredibly zippy running Win7. You will not feel like a slug. Seems on par with i3 or i5 offerings at a far better price. Hopefully AMD keeps it up. Used an A8 in a NAS and was also very pleased. Worth a try if you want to build a small system with enough power to do anything other than playing games at ultra high settings.
B004QX07G4|5.0|This is a &#34;must-have&#34; for all Ellen DeGeneres fans!  This is a funny book, well written and an enjoyable read.
0670451495|5.0|A book from childhood.  Got this as a baby gift for a friend for her children!  Speedy transaction. Thank you!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|When I purchased this it was cheaper then the DVD set. Such a great collection and at a great price.
B0090KZDSK|2.0|I absolutely loved the first 2 books, but the third really was stretched out and seriously what a disastrous ending. I was so looking forward to the 3rd book to find out that there are 2 more - seriously !!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|the game itself looks awesome. people say it crashes though. I still haven't downloaded it yet. I'm still getting worried.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|One of the best games for my Kindle Fire.  Cute graphics, lots of action, and doesn't force you to buy or network to advance.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|You won't be able to put it down- a fun, challenging and highly addictive skill game. Beware of the tiny balls!
0425263924|5.0|I enjoyed this filler book in the Crossfire series.  I felt the plot develop more and it kept me entertained and wanting more.  Perfect third book!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I became in love with Gideon and Eva from the first book  and the story just keeps getting better! I have to admit I was a little worried when I saw a lot of bad reviews it almost made me not want to read Entwined with You , but when I started reading again I couldn't stop! Sylvia Day please don't make us wait too long for number 4 your fans are trying to patiently wait for more Gideon !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Fitting end.  A bit of nostalgia looms for the readers. However, it beats the cliches that often plague the endings of similar plots.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The graphics are pretty good, and I highly enjoy the similarities this game has to &quot;Temple Run&quot;. Love the minions!
B007JNWJMI|4.0|I have used it and like it, just wish it had more things to adjust your own pictures.  I do recommend it, if you are just a novice and love to play around with your own photos.
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|Visually this movie is a feast for the eyes - especially if you like photography, or surrealism (nothing morbid or gross) some scenes will really wow you. That being said the story, or better yet the plot falls pretty flat - a bit more than I expected actually. The premise of this movie is not that bad, but while watching it I could not make up my mind if this was trying to be more of a fantasy or a wanna-be gritty story. It also seemed as if the plot was not fully developed or pushed where it could have gone - interaction between the characters and line of events felt a bit disconnected, and I ended up wandering about several things that were left unresolved. Some scenes, dialogue and narration I found plain cheesy.<br />Rent it? Yes. Buy it? Um, maybe if it includes some cool screensaver and desktop images for my computer.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I am not sure about this because I am not sure how this whole thing works.  I find the items and then what?  If I find some of the items in the allotted time, it then tells me that I found no items!!  I think I need clearer instructions as to how to play!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This is a really well put game but i've already spent about $15 on in game things in less than 24 hours Being a long time member of Gaia online understand that cash shops are neccesary but i feel it to be a little overkill that its basically needed to advance at a real pace. If the shops would make money without you having to collect them then perhaps it would be a lot better as it is right now it feels like it'll take eternity to finish.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The book was very entertaining, always with a DeMille book!<br />John and Kate Corey and Paul Brenner were fantastic!<br /><br />Great job Mr. DeMille.
