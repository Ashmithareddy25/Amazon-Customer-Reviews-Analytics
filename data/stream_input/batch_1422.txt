B006WXW098|5.0|This is a surprisingly successful album, since hearing eighteen encores filling up 68 in. of miniatures isn't necessarily enticing.  For a virtuoso with Yuja Wang's exceptional technique, even among her kind, an encore is almost always a dazzler, a finger-crunching display first and music second. For those reasons, I've only owned two encore records over the years, one from Horowitz (bought in college so that I could hear his rendition of Stars and Stripes Forever), the other from Arkadi Volodos, so that I could hear how closely he resembled Horowitz. May I suggest that Wang outdoes both? She plays without vulgar showmanship, and when she steps into Horowitz's home territory - playing his famous arrangement of themes from Bizet's Carmen (also included on Volodos's debut CD) - there's no aggression of the kind that gets audiences to leap to their feet. She almost never uses her fingers like hammers.<br /><br />Wang realizes that we aren't hearing true encores, because we aren't at a concert fired up by the main event. We're coming to this CD cold.  Therefore, she adapts these pieces into real music, experiences of her artistry more than her prowess. You can sit through the cascade of notes in Liszt's arrangement of Schubert's Gretchen am Spinnrade because the fireworks are secondary to Wang's sensitive rendering of the song itself. Some of these showpieces are closer to what Sir Thomas Beecham called \\"derangements\\" than arrangements, as for example the two longest works, Dukas' Sorcerer's Apprentice and Saint-Saens' Danse macabre, and memories of Horowitz and Cziffra, who were incendiary in their approach, aren't erased. But Wang's subtler methods never induce a headache or cloying satiation.<br /><br />The only quiet work is a Chopin waltz, which serves as a kind of sorbet course to refresh the palate. there are also two groupings of \\"real\\" music, in the form of four Etudes by Rachmaninov and five miniatures by Scriabin. Listening to how beautifully Wang engages this wide variety, I began to think that among the current generation of awe-inducing young virtuosos, she could well be the most musical.  This implies a chance for lasting greatness as her career unfolds.s wide variety, I began to think that among the current generation of awe-inducing young virtuosos, she could well be the most musical.

0312576463|5.0|Jonathan Franzen's latest novel may not be at the top of the list of believable realism, which is why many don't like it, but the characters in this novel come across as truly human.  No one is wholly good.  No one is evil or unreasonably selfish.  Most of all, not a single person in this novel, child, adult, or rock star, knows what they're doing.  This, I believe, is what makes this novel worth a read.<br /><br />Patty, Richard, Walter, and Joey (the novel's four main characters) are refreshingly irrational, sometimes even committing the cardinal sin of \\"acting out of character.\\"  For me, this irrationality is what makes them humans.  We all make bad decisions and mess our lives up every once in a while, and Franzen isn't afraid to address the endearing and innate humanness of our scramble as we enter into and then exist within our adulthood.

B005CM9DX6|3.0|\\"Heritage' is Opeth's 10th studio album and one that will probably divide fans for the rest of their career.  Up until this time, Opeth has always been known for their mix of progressive rock and power metal.  The vocals have been a unique blend of death metal growls and clean more traditional rock vocal stylings.  The one exception to this formula was the \\"Damnation\\" album from a few years back that featured all \\"clean\\" vocals and a more acoustic oriented approach.  \\"Heritage\\" is unlike any album this band has produced before.  This is straight ahead progressive rock with no death metal vocals and very few really heavy passages.  Some fans see this as a natural progression / maturation for the band that is an inevitable consequence of their constant evolution of exploring new territories.  For other fans the album is the ultimate sell out, where the band abandoned their roots and pandered to a more middle of the road audience.  To my ears the truth lies somewhere in between these two extremes.  The musicianship, as always with Opeth, is stellar and Arkerfeldt's vocals are pristine.  The problem that I find here though, is that none of the material seems to stick with me very long.  I listen to the album, enjoy it, but don't remember much about it after the fact.  There are a lot of prog bands out there these days doing music very similar to this and I am not sure that this album stands out significantly among that crowd.  Overall I continue to have mixed feelings on \\"Heritage\\".  I have never been a huge fan of death metal vocals, so the fact that the band was going to do a \\"clean\\" album was something I was looking forward to.  In the end what I got was a fine progressive rock album, but with something I can't quite put my finger on missing.  Bottom line, I like it, but don't love it.  I have a feeling this is one that I will be pulling out from time to time over the years and I am also thinking it may grow on me with continued listens.  Only time will tell I guess.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The energy runs out fast but as you get up in levels it will take longer! I love this game! had it on my iphone first and got to where I never ran out of energy and I have 200000 plus coins! your village isn't going to come together over night! use the free cash it comes with to buy the better axe! it will save you a lot of energy when chopping trees!

B00785P2QC|4.0|I was playing the other version of this game and after bout 20 or so missions I just really wanted to build on my own. So I went looking for a sandbox mode and found this. It's kinda like a facebook game but a lot better, it still has some of those things that make facebook games so annoying like buying points and stuff but the energy bar is quite big and u can do a lot more.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is really good it reminds me of the good op days playing Mario all day but I really enjoy it and I look forward to playing it a lot in the future
B004SIPAJG|5.0|I saw this movie 5 times in the movie theater when it first came out. Yes, I liked it that much.  Great movie and I'm so glad to have it at home now. Dance, romance, campy & full of Australians.  How could you not like this movie.  Frankly, I liked it more than Priscilla Queen of the Desert. There's some fabulous foot work in this flick.  & those two little kids are hilarious.  Absolutely worth it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is sssoooo fun.I play it all day.you can play it on your kindle fire too.the good thing is that it is free.
0670023329|5.0|I could not put this down. I knew absolutely nothing about North Korea. For me, it was all new information and fascinating and horrific that this goes on in modern day.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this is a pretty cool game although it has the same concept as a pet story. but overall is fun and entertaining.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I thought that this game was very similar to mario. The graphics are superb though they coild work on the animation. I like how they practically remodled the super mario levels mixing in the old level styles with the new.  Compared to the various super mario spinoffs, I'd rank this among the best. This is by far one of the best free apps on the Kindle store.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|As a lifelong fan of Oregon Trail, I was sorely disapppointed to see that this is one of those time and money-sucking Facebook games. The whole point of the wait-reward system is to keep you addicted. Also the notifications don't shut off and that's just alarming. Uninstall.
0439023513|2.0|I am an avid fan of this trilogy. Once I started I could not stop until I had finished all three books. That was until about the last 50 pages of Mockingjay. No spoilers here, but I simply refuse to believe that it was written by the same person who evoked so much emotion from me in the first 2.5 books. Disappointed is a shocking understatement when it comes to describing how I felt about the ending. Not because it was happy or sad, but because it was poorly delivered and pressed for time. Gale, Haymitch, Finnick, Peeta, Prim and Katniss deserved a much more epic ending to their tragic tale.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is so fun it has great graphics and it is really worth it to download this super fun game!  (:
B006OKOZGU|5.0|Video quality is top notch. Grant's striped shirt maintains its stripedness (made up word) whereas on the video tape I had it was a mess. The colors pop out. Grace Kelly is elegant. The fireworks were very fake looking, fx not what they are today.<br />Sound is very good for its time.<br />Extras are OK.<br />Wonderful story, great movie. Recommended!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game reminds me of Angry Birds in its simplicity, but does not rely on aiming luck but on patience and skill.

B0016K40KY|4.0|true love for director's dedication to bringing this story to brilliant life with so many elements of character, culture, cohesion, and cinematic challenges... Peter O reigns supreme in this defining role that transforms his ego as well as his successful efforts to unite radically misaligned desert tribes, a feat comparable to Patton!  I treasured the lingering moments that demonstrated the tribal life and cross cultural assimilation... the pace was perfect for demonstraing the patient alignment of diverse goals with successful results... The overwhelming addiction of power and watching Lawrence dance in his new robes of freedom yielded a commensurate level of joy without the consicous responsibility of a wretched nation fighting for independence, albeit with limited success... How these war scenes were filmed is beyond my comprehension, have ultimate respect for the crew, actors and energy required to produce this phenomenal presentation.... what really happened with Effendi though, changed his whole mindset and the only plot hole I wish was resolved... v. v. high recommend!
B000001GQB|2.0|This CD arrived in a timely manner, but for some unknown reason the audio plays extremely low on my equipment.  I have to turn the volume up to a ridiculous level to get audible sound.  ??  This is unfortunate because these symphonies are some of my favorites.

B002ZG983M|5.0|Kick-Ass is the greatest comic book movie ever made.<br /><br />I am writing this review in 2012, several years after Kick-Ass was released. I watch the film every three months. After this month's viewing I felt compelled to express my love for this movie. The superheroes don't have super powers but the slow-mo gravity-defying fights are fantastic, the themes are deep with lots of Shakespearian issues between fathers and their children, sexy wide-eyed girlfriends worship their nerd paramours, things blow up loudly, people bleed, people die, it's sad, it's funny, its deep, and it's all set to a loud non-cheezy rocking soundtrack. The writing is tight, the camera work is beautiful and the acting, especially Nicholas Cage, is world class.<br /><br />Much has been said about Nicholas Cage's work over the last few years, most of it unkind. In Kick-Ass, as the super hero Big Daddy, Cage, a HUGE comic book fan, found the role that he wanted to play his entire life. I don't know how the producers got away with the exact duplication of the Batman costume, but it brings a whole new level to the proceedings, and Cage does not let the opportunity pass to play a unique, brutal, justice-seeking killing-machine. He grabs it and chokes it to death. Congratulations, Mr. Cage, on your stunning performance.<br /><br />I just hope that there is no sequel to Kick-Ass, even though it certainly was set up that way. As a standalone film, it may not have made much of a ripple or made any money, but it had its own charming personality and it did set new rules (Why don't super heros bleed? Why not shoot the Joker?). It came on strong without any prior comic mythology to bog it down. Thanks to whoever took the leap of faith and put the huge amount of money up to make this wonderful film; thanks to all those who put in the hard and creative work photographing, writing, directing, acting and bringing this piece to life; and, finally, thanks to whoever remembered that comics started in a kid's bedroom, not a film studio's board room.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I find his books in general fascinating and I like his angle on plots in the world. It is very nice to have a viewpoint on these secret societies from an action perspective and it is a fun read.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I've been fairly happy with this app on my Kindle Fire. It's been much easier than using the browser to check my mail. I haven't had the issues with how many emails it displays. I simply scroll the page and I can easily view as many as I want. My two main issues are the contacts and the new ads. When I try to compose a message and try to add a contact,  it always takes me to a blank list. This means I either have to memorize email addresses,  or find an old email from that contact and hit reply. I cannot find a folder to view the contacts when not writing a message so I can't view them that way either. The ads don't bother me much,  but since the update that added them,  it seems to have a bit of a lag when switching between pages.

B006OCM0G0|3.0|the first day I got this game,  my grades were around an A. after I bought it, they plummeted to about a low B. in other words, this game I every addicting. so many of my friends have bought it because they saw me playing it, and now they HATE me because they cant stop playing it. I will let you decide if that is a bad thing or a good thing,  but if you have a phone that your kid plays on,  don't get this game, because they're gonna be bugging you every 5 minutes to go check on there omelets. no joke. just proceed with caution....this game needs wifi in order to work,  so you cant get on your restaurant if you don't have wifi

0670023329|3.0|This is the story of Shin Dong hyuk, an inmate born and raised in \\"the infamous \\"Camp 14\\" of the DPKR prison system. It is Shin's story of his life within, his escape from, and his life after, prison --as told by the author, a Washington Post reporter. Although poorly written by the author, with political analysis that sometimes is more annoying than enlightening, what is unique about this prison story is first that no one has ever told a story of what it is like to have been born, raised, and lived his entire life (and expected to die) entirely within a prison system: that is to say to have lived his entire life without ever having imagined or had knowledge or contact with an outside world? Shin did not know that there was an idea of a god, or a government, or even that North Korea was a country. All he knew was what the guards in Camp-14 taught him.<br /><br />Even without the traumatic parts of Shin's story - of torture, maiming, daily executions, beatings and of the never-ending fight for food and survival (of having to eat rats, insects and even kernels of corn from cow dung, etc.)  - Shin's story is unique in that it is minus a context for normal rational, moral and human calculations.  In this sense, \\"Camp-14\\" constitutes a very new and special kind of hell and this book should have been a window into how that hell actually works. But this is not what the author gave us. Instead he kept trying to overlay his own political analysis over the story of Shin's existence within the prison system.<br /><br />It can be said that at least the inmates of Auschwitz had previously lived normal lives and thus had as a backdrop what it once was like to have had a normal existence in a normal world. Shin, on the other hand, had no such backdrop. Raw survival and self-preservation \\"in the moment\\" were both the foreground and background to his existence.  Camp-14 was the ever-present and tightly drawn boundaries constituting the totality of this existential reality. In fact,with no books to read, or people from the other side to talk to, he knew nothing of any other existence. Later, when his cellmate Park, told him that he (Park) had lived in Pyongyang, which was only 50 miles from the camp, Shin asked Park what Pyongyang was? He simply did not know (and could not imagined) that there was a world beyond the prison walls.<br /><br />As a result of his hermetically sealed life in the gulag of all gulags, Shin's morality, such as it was, was completely shaped by how he would get his next meal. He even perceived his own mother and brother as being in competition with him for food.  The code of the prison yard was \\"snitch and live for another day.\\" That is why Shin informed on his own mother and brother about their plans to escape, and then watched without remorse as they both were executed: his mother hanged, his brother shot.<br /><br />However Shin's world and his life changed when he was housed with a new inmate, Park, whom he was assigned to snitch on in exchange for better food, work assignments and accommodations. But instead of snitching on Park, who regaled him daily about what life in the \\"out world\\" was like, Shin instead became Park's friend and eventually escaped from the camp with him. And although Park was electrocuted in the escape attempt, Shin used his smoking body as insulation to get through the fence, and did eventually reach freedom. Shin was to learn that there was indeed a different world on the other side that lived by a different kind of moral code. Memories of his past lack of conscience, troubled him, and freedom with lots of food was not as easy as Shin had imagined.<br /><br />Here sat a very pregnant theme that was all but completely ignored by this author. It seems that he preferred instead to emphasize and rehearse old themes bashing the debased DPRK government rather than trying to get inside the mind of one human damaged by North Korea's totalitarian system. Three stars
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game....lots of fun It is a lot like the classic Mario brothers. Controls are a little awkward. take some getting used to.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I almost did not read the first book due to many bad reviews.....I decided to read and form my own opinion. Good decision. This trilogy was a modern day romance. Christian was so emotionally messed up due to early childhood and betrayed by his adopted moms best friend. He was a good person learning how to love in a real way! Loved story line.......Am now in withdrawal! Only thing to gripe about is over-useage of vocabulary and phrases............Thumbs up

0877207534|1.0|I spent an entire semester of English class reading and analyzing this book.  What I learned was that this book starts dry with disengaging characters, while the plot proceeds at a painstakingly slow pace for very little to happen.  Sure, there are plenty of worse authors and worse books out there, but The Heart is a Lonely Hunter makes a strong case for the worst book I've ever read.  I can only describe it as an insipid waste of time.  This book will not entertain you, and it will not make you smarter in any way.  I truly hate this book with a passion.<br /><br />This book might be good for English majors or snobs who want to appear well-read. It's one of those books that people assume is of high literary value when in fact it borders on garbage.  Pointing this out is unpopular and goes against the status-quo.  At first I planned to buy a few dozen used copies and burn them to ensure people won't have to endure this awful book.  But then I decided I'd rather have people read it to find out for themselves just how bad it is.  They might like the first chapter, and tolerate the second, but by the third chapter they will know they are holding a complete waste of paper.  The story ends with the book sold back to some poor customer on Amazon.  Just look at how popular used copies are.  People are desperate to get rid of this nonsense.

B0064BWE8U|5.0|Poppy Wyatt is about to marry Magnus Tavish and is really happy about it until she loses her engagement ring while partying with her girlfriends. And then someone steals her mobile phone and Poppy panics because that's the number she gave out in case someone finds her ring. As she is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, Poppy finds a phone in a bin and starts using that number. She finds out that the phone belongs to Sam Roxton's ex-PA, who has just quit her job. Poppy turns out helping Sam, and since he owes Poppy one, he lets her use the phone until her ring is found and as long as she forwards him his messages. Sharing a mailbox turns out to be slightly weird and quite amusing!<br /><br />This book took me by surprise. I thought I had it all figured out in the beginning but then I found myself thinking \\"Oh no, she didn't!!\\" a couple of times, which shows I wasn't really expecting the twists and turns that followed. Even in the end I was a bit blindsided by the events. I'm definitely reading other Sophie Kinsella's books. The text dialogues between Sam and Poppy are very funny and the plot is slightly spiced up with some mysterious phone calls. Most characters are highly likeable and the ones that aren't turn out to be interesting on their own, specially Magnus' parents. I really enjoyed the book, but I must say the excess of footnotes was irritating. Some were funny and worth reading, but there were too many of them - I know it's part of the joke, but still.
0525478817|5.0|I thought this was one of the best books I've ever read. Before I bought it, I just assumed it would be just another lame romantic novel- but it was so much more than that. It moved me, it inspired me. I wish i can read it a thousand times. I feel like I know the characters Hazel and Augustus so well. Althought I don't have terminal cancer- I can relate to them and understand their pain. I highly recommend this book. Good job John Green.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book departs quite a bit from the prior two books. It is clear from the reviews here that this is also the most controversial book of the trilogy. People seem to love it or hate it based in part on their vision of how the love triangle should have been resolved, or whether the ending was satisfying or not. For my part, I really enjoyed the last book but not as much as the first two. It still tells a good story, but it spends far too much time on Katniss' inner turmoil and the fight against her inner demons. It feels like half of each chapter was devoted to overly long, detailed descriptions of Katniss' nightmares, or detailed descriptions of that day's inner drama.  To be honest, I just started skipping through those long paragraphs until the story picked back up.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: Many reviewers have commented on the seemingly dreary ending, and how Katniss' sadness never seemed to end. The author does provide a ray of sunshine, but it is subtle. When Peeta and Katniss are finishing their book of things to never forget, they mention the pact they made to live happy lives so that the loss of their loved ones should not have been in vain. Because of this, it was clear enough to me that Katniss was indeed happy and loved her children and Peeta. I think to have the expression of happiness be any stronger would have been inconsistent with the tone of the last book, and would have ignored the tremendous loss the characters all suffered. Both Katniss and Peeta had changed because of their experiences, but found the strength (and each other) to keep moving forward and enjoy life. Overall I thought it was a good book, but I expect the ending will be changed for the final movie.
B007R41E8O|4.0|I was very pleased with this game, aside from a few restarts (it was very quick to recover though), the game ran very smoothly and the graphics were excellent. The ending left me a bit puzzled, with lingering questions I'd love to see answered, but that didn't really detract from the overall game experience.<br /><br />The game is very atmospheric, and suitably creepy, but nothing to leave lasting trauma :-D -- unless you're phobic of things that scurry. If a random spider or mouse will ruin your day, give this a pass, otherwise, enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am a 64 year old female/mother/grandmother that was embarassed to admit I read the Twilight Series (all 4 books) at least 6 times.  To find a book like 50 Shades that still brings out my lost youth and feelings is priceless.  The book was much racier than Twilight but still had the elements of wants and needs we all experience at any age.  Well written and just on the edge of being smutty, but the author always seems to soften up the rough edges with compassion and feelings.  Absolutely loved the book.  Anxious for my glass of wine tonight and start reading the second book!
B004LWZVZC|4.0|The movie takes place at the end of the American Civil War.  The movie's plot concerns the alleged conspirators of the assanation of President Lincoln.  A young 27 year old US Army captain (James McAvoy) is given the responsibility of defending one of the alleged conspirators , Mary Surratt (Robin Wright).  Mrs. Surratt is a widow who owned a boarding house where John Wilkes Booth and others, including her son conspired to kill Lincoln.  The question posed is: Is Mary also part of the conspiracy?<br /><br />What I found difficult is the movie takes on a crime suspense feel.  Yet I it loses its suspense for me since I know the eventual outcome of the trial.  What I found fascinating is the overall sentiments of a 1865 post-war American.  The conflict within the young northern attorney who struggles to defend a Southern Catholic and the personal sacrifices he makes to defend the constitutional right to a fair trial.  This theme is that resonates again and again.  It is clear the trial (war tribunal) is a set out to revenge the death of their fallen leader.  But do the ends justify the means?<br /><br />The movie is nicely staged, with decent quality scenes and acting.  Consumes were nicely done and helped set the era.  The acting is good, better than some but not an Oscar contender.  McAvoy gives a convincing performance.  I would give it three and a half stars.  If you don't know much about the plot to kill Lincoln then it would definitely be worth a watch.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Law abiding citizens is a movie you'll enjoy from start to finish. Great action and suspense and great acting. Though you probably won't watch it a 2nd time for this type of movies.
0670023329|5.0|A shocking look at life in one of North Korea's prison camps.  These camps are actually work camps where the prisoners work grueling 12-14 hour days with no hope of ever leaving.  Most die before they reach 50 due to diseases associated with overwork and malnutrition.  As I read the book, I thought of Solzhenitsyn's \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\\", which described the Soviet gulag.  The North Korean prison is worse because in most cases there is no exit (Solzhenitsyn himself served 8 years in a Soviet prison camp). The pictures in the book showing the North Korean leadership with their fat and characterless faces makes you angry at the injustice in this world.  But as the book shows, the gradual opening of trade with China, which is needed to provide meager amounts of food to the general population, is slowly introducing cheap radios and movies, which are awakening the population to the reality of the pathetic life that they are leading in North Korea.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I'm not going to write much. I have been a long time fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs since a child, even loved those silly English, Hammer Studio productions of At The Earth's Core, The Land that Time Forgot, The People That Time Forgot, etc. This film was gleefully exactly what I though it would be: a classic \\"Swords and Sandals\\" epic right up there with the best of any Ray Harryhausen epic, etc. Unfortunately, the marketing chimps at dis-ney forgot that they needed to work a little harder at creating a new audience (these books are almost a 100 years old and have been plundered by Lucas, etc. ever since) and instead got lazy and thought all they needed to do do was \\"ape\\" the marketing of the recent remake of Clash of the Titans (I call it Crap of the Titans). Can't wait for this to get a proper Blu Ray release. This film is beautiful to behold and I am so dying to go back to Barsoom! Hail Deja Thoris! Long live Dotar Sojat!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game its soooo cute and fun. The graphics are great. Its not just for kids. fun for all ages seriously its a great game! I'm sooo addicted to this game! the animals are so real.
B003ZMF26W|4.0|It took a minute to get used to the interface but after reading up a bit it was awesome. Very comfortable and flashy looking. Its all good stuff. I like all of the buttons and the ability to switch which buttons do what. Lighting looks great as well. Loving the profiles as well.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|it is a good game but I do not play it that much but If I need a game to play I might choose this one.

0345803485|2.0|Given this had so many 5 star reviews I read it all the way through hoping the ending would fill in the lacking.<br />What is all of the excitement about over this book?  what am i missing here?<br />So, I go on to read those 5 star reviews and people are saying \\"having a love affair with this book\\" or \\"after reading the trilogy, devastated that the story is over\\".<br />love affair with the \\"book\\"...; \\"most erotic fantasies I've ever experienced\\"; \\"devastated\\" that the book ended.  that answered my question.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is probably the best puzzle game available!  it relaxing and challenging at the same time.  I definitely regimens it!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have to say that the thought of bringing Jillian into my home made me feel like I would be annoyed and not work out. I see how tough she is with the biggest loser contestants. I'm a tough chick, and I don't like people telling me what to do and ordering me around. However, I don't find her to be that bad on the video. I actually do not find her annoying, and yes, it is repetitive, but honestly you bought a dvd, get over it. Of course you'll hear the same stuff over and over. Duh. Use the silencer option and you'll only hear the music. I am a snobby musician and not a fan of the music but whatever, it is what it is...typical work out music. I just ignore it really.<br /><br />What I do like about this work out as a busy Mom, is that it's 20 minutes. The best part is that I feel as though it can give me the work out I need in a short time. I feel like I hit all major areas of my body in the most efficient time. It's great to do when baby naps and we all know how hard it is to find 20 minutes a day to do anything! I'm hoping to see real results from this workout. Losing baby weight is more difficult then I thought so I'm hoping this kick starts it and persuades it to go away. Wishful thinking!<br /><br />Highly recommend this workout!
B0055SWM08|5.0|What a wonderful game. It is my favorite smart phone game so far. The structure allows you to start and stop whenever you please. The challenges can be deceptively simple or will have you thinking long and hard! Well done!

B003L77G2Y|5.0|My husband puts his life on hold to watch this show.  It is captivating the way each show begins, but if you miss one part you might as well forget keeping up with the episode. Hence- purchase the season on DVD.
B004K7HMJ6|5.0|I was going through a phase of checking out the newer girls on the block - Katy Perry, Kesha and Lady Gaga. Then I discovered one of the most amazing debuts - Jessie J.<br /><br />Who You Are Deluxe Edition (gold cover with three more tracks and bonus DVD) achieved a local release in my territory. You might want to consider the UK import because it's a really great record.<br /><br />A first listen to the smash Domino, Jessie J comes off like a Katy Perry clone. But the rest of the CD unveils a stellar vocal stylist with a penchant for mixing pop, reggae and soul. Examples include Price Tag, Stand Up, L.O.V.E. and Do It Like A Dude.<br /><br />The DVD includes six concert performances meshed with interviews and five music videos. Unfortunately, Domino isn't here. Jessie's a great live performer and has superb chemistry with the audience.<br /><br />I'm glad I waited. Nowadays, record companies put out so many different versions that the standard ones are really getting obsolete. Where I live, the local deluxe versions are even cheaper than the standard imports.<br /><br />LOVE LOVE LOVE JESSIE J!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|it really all depends on whether or not you think he terms of service are worth it. for the note taking goodness; it is conceivably worth it-depending on your idea of privacy. as a piece of technology? 5 stars. tlfor the invasion of privacy? one star. 4 stars when all is said and done.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|The bakery has expanded and seven more items are added to the menu. Included are three new songs - Part Of Me, Wide Awake and Dressin' Up which are sugary ear candy.<br /><br />The E.T. feat Kanye West and Last Friday Night feat Missy Elliott are works in progress that probably happened after the original Teenage Dream dropped. There's also a very moving acoustic rendition of The One That Got Away.<br /><br />Topping off this sweet fest is the Tommie Sunshine's Megasix Smash-up of Teenage Dream, Last Friday Night, California Gurls, Firework, E.T. and The One That Got Away.<br /><br />The lenticular cover is a separate piece placed on top of the original booklet. If you tilt it, the new Complete Confection image alternates with the old Katy in the clouds picture. However, Capitol could have used some unreleased photos. A little disappointing in this aspect.<br /><br />Overall, Teenage Dream is a classic pop album made better. This 'complete' and updated confection is bursting with new and improved musical flavours. In addition, the 3D cover is a supposedly limited edition, so it might be worthwhile as this could be a sought after collectors' item.
B004SIP73U|4.0|I watched this movie expecting Meryl Streep and Phillip Seymore Hoffman to dominate as they always do. In both cases, these were amazing, layered performances, and maybe the best either of them have done (though, how one can choose...both are such brilliant actors!). Meryl and Phillip always astound me as they slip, chameleon-like into any role; body, voice, gesture, and movement all exactly in tune with the parts played.<br /><br />The showstopper, however, was the scene with Viola Davis, as Donald's terrified, trapped, broken mother. That scene was the entire movie. The twisted, heart-rending, gut-wrenching agony of a mother's love; having to make her own sort of Sophie's Choice, a deal with the devil, in accepting one unknown sort of fate for her son, while trying desperately to protect him from the terrible  certainty of another. She deserved the Oscar nod, and should have won for this amazing, one scene performance.
B0009HLD0K|3.0|This is a wonderful movie, probably in my all-time top 10.  But the treatment for this DVD is shameful.  For years, it was available only in full-screen format, which meant the sides of the picture were cut off so that there would be no letterboxing on old 4:3 television sets. That's bad enough.<br /><br />So now they've brought out the \\"widescreen\\" edition. Clearly, all they did was take the old full-screen release and blow it up, this time chopping off the top and bottom of the picture so that it now fits modern 16:9 TV sets.<br /><br />So by now the image, which was crappy to start with, has been blown up by a factor of about two, making it even crappier. You're probably seeing about the center 60% of the original image.<br /><br />The sound is also bad.<br /><br />20th Century Fox should be ashamed for kicking a classic like this to the curb.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Love Paper Camera! The filters are great.  Love that you can apply to previous pics as well as new ones taken with PC.

0545425115|5.0|Every year, twenty-four teenage \\"tributes\\" are brought to the Capitol of Panem, and sent out into the arena to kill each other on live TV. Only one will survive.<br /><br />This chilling premise is at the center of \\"The Hunter Games,\\" the brilliant, powerful first book of Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy. It's a slow-burning, brutal, chilling thriller twined with some barbed satire (reality TV!) and an oppressive government -- but at heart, it's an uplifting story about a young woman fighting to be free.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen lives in the impoverished District 12, hunting food to provide for her mother and her beloved little sister Prim. But on the day of the reaping, Prim is selected. And Katniss does something no one else has done in a long time -- she volunteers to go instead. Along with the male tribute, Peeta Mellark -- a boy who once helped her at her lowest point -- she is swept away to the Capitol.<br /><br />Once there, the tributes are pampered, tutored, styled and turned into celebrities -- until they're released into the arena, and start killing each other to survive. Katniss must evade murderous gangs, traps, and genetically engineered beasts.<br /><br />But after their triumphant first appearance at the Capitol, the audience has taken a shine to the impoverished young \\"lovers\\" and are rooting for them to triumph. But if both Katniss and Peeta are to survive, they must learn how to play the game that the gamemakers and polticians are playing -- and use the Hunger Games against them.<br /><br />A lot has been made of \\"The Hunger Games'\\" resemblance to the Japanese franchise \\"Battle Royale,\\" but honestly the only real similarity is the core concept. Suzanne Collins' world is a far stranger place, set in a futuristic North America where rebellion is brewing against a tyrant. And it seems more to be a barbed, glass-sharp satire on reality TV and how easily people are swayed, either for evil or good.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' writing style here takes a little getting used to -- she not only writes everything in the first person, but in the present tense. It's.... a little strange, and it takes some getting used to.<br /><br />But once you do get used to the odd style, Collins' writing is on fire. She writes in an intense, slow-burning style that is speckled with bittersweet scenes (Katniss singing to Rue) and colorful descriptions (the superficial, sparkly Capitol). But it's also brutally violent at times, with various teens being killed in some truly gruesome ways (broken neck, countless stings, arrows) -- and though Collins doesn't go into graphic detail, it's still pretty shocking.<br /><br />But at heart, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is about one young woman's struggle. Katniss is a struly striking heroine -- she's strong, tough and fiery, as you'd expect of a girl who has been supporting her family, but she has the right amount of vulnerability and kindness. Peeta is a very sweet, sensitive love interest who complements her perfectly, and there's a strong round of supporting characters -- the clever stylist Cinna, the drunken ex-tribute Haymitch, the birdlike Rue, and many others.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is one of those rare books that strikes a deep chord in people's souls -- and it's a beautifully (if oddly) written story with a brilliant heroine.

0439023491|5.0|I loved the first book, Hunger Games, and couldn't wait to read the second, Catching Fire. And it didn't disappoint. Suzanne Collins has a talent for clever arenas and storylines that keep me interested. Sometimes I wanted to slap Katniss for being dense at times... but it's part of her character, a human flaw, I guess. I like the new introduction of characters and situations, the back stories of the characters also help to keep building layers into this world, making it more real, if also, more sadistic. A really good read.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is book is enjoyable at any age. There are many moral/ deep rooted ethical dilemmas confronted by the author. Even though this book may seem very fictional , there are many realistic correlations to our world society.
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|I have been in love with ELO since the 1970's when I owned almost all of their vinyl albums.  Over the years they were lost and I missed my favorite music.  I found their albums on Amazon.com and was amazed at the price!  I bought a few albums, this being one of them and the sound is even better than I remembered!
B002NJWHHA|1.0|Reading the books, I had high hopes for this movie. The movie was missing one major thing: character development. I understand movies need to shorten and change things in order to complete it, but this was just terrible.<br /><br />The only way to save it on the next one is scratch the entire thing and let Peter Jackson take over. Other then that, don't waste your time.
B002M85TF4|5.0|My grandchildren, ages 7 and 4, spent time with me recently. They are in a period of intense learning and absorbing all kinds of information. I wanted to make American musicals part of their learning experience, so I rented this from Amazon and we watched this classic together. A month later, my 4-year-old grandson asked his mother to sing the Indiana song. His mother did not know what he was talking about. He said, you know, \\"Gary, Indiana.\\" I was so proud!

I missed this when it came through the theaters, so I was very happy to see it was available for instant play at Amazon.com. The prevalence of autism has been widely publicized, but without a personal connection to someone who lives with autism, one cannot really understand how people with autism function. Through this movie I became \\"friends\\" with Temple Grandin and therefore began to understand something of how she lives. I have deep respect for her!

B006X96PF6|1.0|As much as I love Loreena, and I do, (I own all of her CDs,) this is just another rehash of the same old material. Her fans hunger for new songs.

B003X2O6KW|5.0|Kanye West may be one of the most egotistical people on the earth but I think that arrogance fuels his music. One of the best albums in recent years.
0439023491|2.0|Though I had a hard time putting down The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins' second book in the trilogy has me yawning.  I think it's the lack of dialogue, the \\"telling\\" instead of showing, the lack of detailed writing that made the first book so much fun to read.  As I trod on to chapter 7, I feel as though I am reading an outline instead of a fully developed story.  It's hard to care about Katniss when she doesn't seem to have any feelings herself.  Pass the potatoes, please.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Movie critics suck, and I will henceforth forego any \\"professional\\" movie critic reviews. Great movie, for kids and adults alike. Needed to be longer though, to really include everything great that was in the book.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Once I picked it up I found it very hard to put down. It wasn't the first novel like game I've played but it by far was the most creative. My first time playing it ended in a bad ending, but instead of being angry I found it kind of shocking and strangly funny. And while by the True ending I fingured out alot I still did not see most of the reveal coming. This story is anything but black and white; for most of the game you think Zero is some twisted freak getting his joy watching his victums blow up, when in reality 'he' is trying to right a wrong done by a really twisted man.
B003ZJ0ZX0|2.0|I saw Bruno Mars on the Grammy Awards and thought he was great -- real James Brown -- great horn section. I ordered his CD and there were no horns. What a disappointment. Maybe he will do a live album and include a horn section.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a real page-turner. It's interesting that it portrays violence but at the same time is opposing it. It gives a pretty bleak view of a possible future world that I hope the students reading it will take as a warning!

B004EPZ0AM|4.0|I purchased this movie after seeing it at the movie theater.The whole audience applauded at the end of the movie at the theater and my whole family loved it on dvd/blu-ray. I think someone is making up numerous one star negative reviews on this film for some unknown crazy reason. You can tell it is the same person who is writing the negative reviews.Just ignore them, and go by the more positive or neutral reviews or better yet,get the dvd and form your own opinions.You can also rent it at your Redbox for a little over a dollar if you want to check it out before buying it.I think it is a great movie and the special effects are fun to watch and very colorful. Great story also.Fun for the whole family.

B004GJYROG|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />  As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's \\"Harlem Globetrotters\\" would dribble onto the airwaves.  Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it.  Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules.  In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team.<br /><br />  \\"Space Jam\\" (hereafter SJ) is largely a Looney Tune, live-action-animation-mix update of those Globetrotter cartoons.  Michael Jordan (wisely playing his rational composed self) is kidnapped from the natural world by Bugs and Daffy in a desperate bid to whip the seemingly hopeless Toon Squad into a viable basketball team against the intimidating Monstars.  The Monstars were originally the miniscule minions (called Nerdlucks) of a ruthless cigar-chewing mobster type (voiced by Danny DeVito) ordered to shanghai the Looneys as enslaved entertainers for an amusement park called Moron Mountain on a distant planet.  Bugs cons the little Nerdlucks into a basketball game, thinking it would be easy to defeat them and keep their freedom.  But the Nerdlucks siphon off the basketball skills of NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkeley to become the Monstars. Uh-oh.  Can Jordan (in the Meadowlark role) help the Looneys win?<br /><br />  After the critical/popular triumph of \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\", SJ at first glance appears to be a shabby, cynical rip-off using Jordan's (and Bugs's) starpower to make a quick profit.  While not quite up there technically or thematically with \\"Roger Rabbit\\", SJ is quite diverting, funny, and even bitingly satirical in its own right.  Even before the wacky basketball game begins, SJ sustains riffs on athletic fame, greedy sports franchises, athletes' moral behavior, and even Jordan himself, especially his ill-advised foray into baseball.  All the Looney Tunes, from Marvin the Martian to Bugs (to even lesser-known 'toons like Sniffles the mouse), get their chance to be sharply humorous.  The human co-stars, including Wayne Knight and Bill Murray (\\"I didn't know Dan Ackroyd was in this picture!\\") as Toon Squad substitutes, acquit themselves well with their limited screen time.  The game itself, free-wheeling as it is, is actually quite exciting and well-executed as Jordan interacts with the multi-colored Monstars.<br /><br />  SJ even has some moral uplift.  Predictably, the Toon Squad is literally being crushed by their brutal opponents during the first half.  Even Jordan's pep talk is futile; it puts the Looneys to sleep.  Bugs comes to the rescue with some \\"Jordan's Secret Stuff\\", a liquid that puts fire back into the team.  Later, as the \\"Secret Stuff\\" is used up, the 'toons learn that it was really just water, and that they had the ability to play the game all along (take that, Dumbo!).  But the game is at the wire, with the Squad down by one point.  Can Jordan make the winning basket?  Maybe, if he can channel his inner Toon (now Bugs tells him!).<br /><br />  SJ is surprisingly satisfying entertainment that makes the extra effort to ensure that Looney Tunes, Jordan, and basketball afficionados -and even many of the rest of us- have a good time.rical in its own right.

B002ZB26AO|5.0|This book was gripping and I read it all in just two sittings. It captivated me from the beginning. It gives a thorough understanding of life under the North Korean regime that we ordinarily would not see. Told through the lives of several North Koreans we share their intimate daily struggles, lives and efforts to survive this brutal regime. It will make you come away with an appreciation of freedom and no one who reads this will ever through around the word 'communist' again so lightly when referring to America.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A world of after the apocolypse and people hunkered down in a underground bunker.  This is a compilation of five short stories that make one book of over 8000 kindle 'locations'.  The story was interesting.  The author used the device of switching back and forth with his timeline, something I'm starting to get tired of, a device that if used carefully can add to the impact of the story but now seems to be used by many authors without control like long overcoats in movies after 'Matrix' came out.<br /><br />There were also portions describing activity of a charactor that just went on too long, I grew tired of reading the hardship the charactor was going thru and just wanted to find out what happened next.<br /><br />That being said, I did like this book and I will spend time in my future looking around once in a while to see if the author writes more of this story line.  The concept is good, and the writing improves as the story progresses.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Is a very fun game. reminds me of super Mario bros. get it get it get it please. u wont b disappointed
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was wary at first and do not like BDSM as a general rule - it generally irritates me when authors try to make that seem romantic, but somehow this book actually has a romance going and the character of Christian Grey, while not entirely likeable, is compelling.  I enjoyed this trilogy mostly because of Christian Grey which surprised me.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought this at fry's because i wanted a liquid cooler but this one is just as good as one and much cheaper...so i have a push and pull with a blue fan as the intake and red one as the exhaust (for looks). it fits in my computer fine...my board is an ATX mini so its very tight, but sickkkk. it does go over one ram slot but its fine for me because i dont plan on adding more ram anyways. it does touch my case side but its enough to close fine. its huge btw.<br /><br />so for the temps...im running an AMD Athlon II X4 640 O.C. 3.7ghz and it keeps idle=40c and load=55c, my stock cooler at 3.5ghz was like idle=46c load=80c (very bad!!!!) and i have good airflow also....so defiantly recommend this cooler and its only 20 bucks, universal for every socket out there and it is a monster
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its a lot like all the facebook games. pretty fun though and doesn't constantly harass you to buy stuff. I also like that playing with friends ia not completely necessary to progress.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this app is completely good. the controls are very good and the graphix are also enjoyable.  I will be spending the rest of my spring break playing on my kindle fire. :)
B0064NTZJO|4.0|\\"Drive\\" looks, feels, and sounds like a present day homage to the groundbreaking 1980's film \\"To Live and Die in L.A.\\".  [[ASIN:B0049M7BHA To Live and Die in L.A. [Blu-ray]]].  Both movies deal with the sometimes fine line that people like police and criminals walk between wanting to wear white hats, wanting to wear black hats, and what their internal character ultimately drives them to be.<br /><br />Gosling portrays a car mechanic by day, part time thief by night who gets drawn into the mob world after he performs some racing stuntwork and catches the eye of bigger league criminals whose tentacles reach into the everyday world. A love interest from his apartment building pulls his character towards more noble directions, as he watches her struggle with first raising her child alone, and then back with a troubled husband after he is released from prison. As the husband's past life comes back to haunt him and endangers the family he now can't be a part of, Gosling decides to fight back against the corrupting elements in fairly dramatic fashion. Although he sometimes comes across like a Charles Bronson straight out of \\"Deathwish\\", taking out low level thugs and mob bosses alike, he ultimately knows he has much in common with those he is killing. This realization doesn't sit well with him, leading to a climax where he cares little if he lives or dies. Going out as \\"one of the good guys\\" might be for the best, ending things before his true nature has a chance to kick back in.<br /><br />All arthouse jokes aside, if you look at the scorpion on Gosling's jacket [[ASIN:B0057VDGNK Drive (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)]] and recall the fable of the scorpion and the frog, you know the movie's theme:  when the scorpion stings the frog as they cross a river, drowning them both, and the frog asks \\"why did you do that?\\", all the scorpion can say is \\"I can't help it, it's in my nature\\".<br /><br />Criticism of Gosling's performance isn't entirely off base, some scenes are slow and the dialogue can be scant. But this can also perhaps be justified by the character and the film's director.  Lets face it, he plays a person who ISN'T right in the head. He's not going to, and shouldn't, act normal. Although not perfect, it works. Any detraction here is also more than made up for by the strong performance of Albert Brooks. Played for most of the movie as the \\"nice guy\\" criminal compared to his evil business partner (Ron Perlman), his true character comes to light in the end with a chilling scene (spoiler alert) where he is forced to kill a likable loser of a friend with an old trademark weapon he thought he had hung up a long time ago. It's one of several memorable scenes where Brooks steals the show. At one point Gosling won't shake hands with Brooks because grease makes his hands dirty.  Brooks insists on the handshake anyways. \\"So are mine\\".<br /><br />If you want to see something like a straight up action movie similar to \\"The Transporter\\", this isn't it. But if you want to go back in time to the early eighties, taking a little bit of \\"Miami Vice\\", a dash of \\"Scarface\\", and even a pinch of \\"Halloween\\" with some arthouse posing, then \\"Drive\\" will take you where you want to go.ow and the dialogue can be scant.

B00000JNNY|5.0|I ordered this CD from Amazon the day after hearing of Ms. James' recent death, something I had been meaning to do for, well, years.  A short time after her passing, the death of another singer with, er, celebrity status occurred, and there was much public ballyhooing of the wasted talent, the great voice, yada, yada.  Well, many are called and few are chosen.  Lots of people have a voice; hardly anyone is able to make as much use of one's voice as Etta James did.  News of the loss of this woman who had an amazing voice and an amazing career may have been eclipsed by other news, but her talent was not eclipsed by anyone's.  For instruction on just how it is that singing gets done, and in how many ways, buy this CD.  Buy it now.  There is a singing lesson in every note.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I first heard the album on E street radio and thought \\"yeah I could give this a listen\\".I have  been a Springsteen fan since the 70's and long ago got used to his ever changing style.But one thing has never changed and that is his genious.It has also been sheer irony at how much I \\"needed\\" his music to give me comfort and inspiration at challenging times in my life.And when it wasn't comforting or inspirational, it was just darn right good and joyous music,Not to mention his unmatched stage show.Well I got my Wrecking Ball CD and can say that the radio did not do this album justice.The musicality of this album is amazing and his stories are again funny,sad and inspiring.People like Springsteen do not have to live the lives of the people they sing about cause they have that rare ability to relate to the human experience.Well the bottom dropped out of my life again and it has been this album that is getting me through .Thanks again Bruce

0307957837|5.0|Although not normally a fan of fantasy, I loved this trilogy (conveniently contained in one thick volume) about a girl with a golden compass, a boy with a subtle knife, a woman with an amber spyglass, parenthood, childhood, the church and, most interestingly to me...death. You could write a book about this 900-plus-pages-long novel (and someone probably has). I began my experience with the story by ordering the CDs from the library and listening to the author himself perform the part of narrator (along with a group of talented persons playing the characters) while driving my car. But it got to the point where I felt compelled to read the dusty copy that had taken up a wide spot on my bookshelf for so long when I was unable to listen. Ultimately, I ended up reading most of the first part of the trilogy through to the end before listening (a second time through) to the audio version of the second and third books. The first story is that of a 12-year-old girl named Lyra, who, given an alethiometer, is able to obtain answers to any question, befriends a bear, and learns a dark secret about her mother, as well as makes friends with a boy from another world. It was my favorite of the three. The middle third follows the acquisition of the subtle life, and more about other worlds, dust, evil, and friendship. In the third installment, the plot becomes increasingly complicated (and harder, for me at least, to follow) with the introduction of even more characters and worlds and not surprising revelations about Lyra. Action, suspense and amazing, fantastic characters and concepts too numerous to count fill the story.<br /><br />Having learned less than 100 pages in that several bookworm friends were unwilling to read the book, I was determined to find out what the supposed anti-Christian stuff was all about. Turns out they were right; the author takes on, smacks around, and throws down (none too gently) the Church before the dust settles. As an open-minded person, I enjoyed reading something so imaginative and complex as much as I like reading stories by authors such as C.S. Lewis, who takes an entirely different tack when it comes to religion. In summary, an imaginative, complex, fantastical story about the triumph of good over evil...or is it evil over good. Also excellent: Watership Down by Richard Adams, The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien and The Great Divorce by C.S. Lewis.ding something so imaginative and complex as much as I like reading stories by authors such as C.S. Lewis, who takes an entirely different tack when it comes to religion.

B005LAIH9A|5.0|Well, I am 25 now, and for awhile I've been struggling with some feelings concerning the things I used to like not being relative or popular anymore, moving onto new hobbies and leaving other things I was constantly into behind, having a broader view on many different subjects, having different opinions on things that I used to feel a certain way about, etc. To put it mildly, I am growing up. I've realized it's important to hold onto things from your past, but you also have to be ready, both feet planted on the ground and facing forward, for the future and what it brings as life continuously changes. To live in the past is death, and I feel that this movie perfectly sums up my feelings and gives them a voice.<br /><br />  I was expecting way more off color jokes, but this movie was SURPRISINGLY deep to me. If you are a warm blooded male, you can remember a time when chasing women was a main reason for living at one point...which has pretty much been the backbone of the American Trilogy...Hey, Stiffler and Finch, were all about Cadence in \\"American Wedding\\" despite Jim and Michelle tying the note being the big deal in that film. But here the tone is DRASTICALLY changed. The boys are still themselves, but older. New challenges arise, as they do with any grown man who is heading into adulthood and away from the care-free days of being a teenager or young adult in their early 20's.<br /><br />  Also, Jim's mom being dead (I hope I didn't spoil this, but I assume we all saw the previews) and the challenges faced by Jim's father, Noah, in moving on also struck a cord with me ( I lost my mother this year) and gave this film a \\"REAL\\" feeling. So we not only saw, young thirty somethings dealing with the loss of youth and the expectations of adulthood, but we also witnessed an elderly man recovering from the heart break of losing the love of his life and the mother of his son. (SOMETHING ANY MARRIED PERSON WHO STICKS IT OUT UNTIL THE END WILL UNFORTUNATELY COME TO ONE DAY)<br/><br />  Most of all, I think the challenges faced by the boys (I mean, men) in their marriages and dealing with their relationships struck the deepest with me because they were authentic problems I think all adult males will run into some of them, at some point in their lives. How they were all handled though, came off as beautiful to me. Watch Vicki's and Kevin's scene at the actual reunion, towards the end of the film, and tell me you don't feel your heart get tugged at a smidge, if not a lot, at the dialogue and how it's finalized.<br /><br />  Keep an open mind and you will enjoy this. When I was young...The adults I saw in their 20's and 30's were \\"The Real Adults\\" to me. Anyone over that, was an \\"old person.\\" Well, funny how things work out. I am sure kids now look up to me as \\"A real adult\\" and my father, uncles, and their friends are now \\"The Old people,\\" when they used to be \\"The real adults\\"...funny how things change, but still stay the same overall...and that's the perfect way to describe this film. The tone is EXTREMELY different, but the characters are still the same, and still extremely enjoyable. As one character said in the film to another (I think it was Choir chick to Chris)...\\"You are so different, but you are still the same.\\"<br /><br />  If you are going to see 1 movie in theaters for a long time, make it this one. Thanks for reading, and maybe bring some kleenex, if you are emotionally mature and inclined to being moved by well done movies.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I first heard \\"Little Talks\\" on Lightning 100 and liked it.  When I saw Amazon had the album for $5, I gave it a quick listen and was glad I did, because I've been listening to it ever since.  Think Edward Sharp and the Magnetic Zeros, only better.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I didn't expect much from the game, but gradually become fond of it. The game is simple to play, but the puzzles are interesting and occasionally make you pause to ponder. With soothing music in the background, it may calm you mind.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|decent game, but I am getting annoyed with the games that ask for money so often.  I'd rather pay up front!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is totally the best city building game so far. An awesome thing about this game is that its on a handheld device so you can play it on the go.
B005YVSIZ4|5.0|You know a show is good when the end of every episode leaves you thrilled and wanting more. This one does that. It doesn't follow the books, so you're getting a different story if you've already read them. I'd say this and Game of Thrones are my two top dramas in a long time.

0393080269|5.0|The average length of time investors hold stocks has been falling from a peak of 16 years in the mid-1960s to under 4 months today. In the 1970s it took $1 of debt to generate $1 of U.S. GDP growth; by the last decade it took $5. Real GDP growth in developed nations is expected to fall this decade to about 2-2.5%. Author Sharma is head of emerging markets at Morgan Stanley and as such spends one week each month visiting other nations looking for the best places to invest. He believes it's no longer possible as in 2003- 2007  to simply bet on rapid growth in any emerging market - those years average 7.2% returns. The amount of funds flowing into those stocks grew 92% between 2000 and 2005, and another 478% between 2005 and 2010. His 'Breakout Nations' provides quick overviews of more than two dozen of the currently most interesting economies for the next decade.<br /><br />His first major conclusion is that China's growth will slow sharply. Total debt as a share of GDP is rising, its cheap labor advantage is rapidly disappearing, its consumers are already strongly participating in its new economy - spending has increased nearly 9%/year for 30 years, and some estimate China already has a 25% share of the world's luxury market, its 'one-child' policy is now bringing an aging population (average age 37 in 2020, vs. 29 in India and 49 in Europe), its highway network is already second only to the U.S., slightly more than half its population is now city-dwelling (691 million), developers have built 'ghost cities' and malls, and its economy is already quite large - the world's second largest.<br /><br />Sharma is even more negative on India. Major problems include its bloated government, crony capitalism, a general reluctance of farmers to leave their land, a state much less able than China to provide world-class infrastructure (it's struggling to arrange sufficient grain storage capacity while people are starving, cannot provide reliable power to existing businesses), investment by Indian businesses have decline from 17% GDP in 2008 to 13% and their overseas operations now account for over 10% of overall corporate profitability, public debt/GDP has reached the 70% level, and there are high demands for social welfare.<br /><br />Brazil, like India, also has high expectations for state-provided social welfare, its currency has risen sharply, growth has fallen to 4% GDP/year during the 2003-07 period, and to combat inflation, Brazil has one of the highest interest rates in the world - leading to an influx of even more currency. Government spending has risen from 20% of GDP in the 1980s to 40% in 2010, while productivity grew at only 0.2% between 1980='08, vs. 4%/year in China. Trucks carrying sugar to Sao Paulo's port wait 2-3 days for lack of space and unloading equipment. Investment levels are only 19%, vs. China's 50%, the average student leaves school after 7 years, vs. 8 in China. New infrastructure spending averages 2% GDP in Brazil vs. 10% in China. The 'good news' is that it now produces 2 mbd of oil and this is expected to reach 6 mbd by 2020.<br /><br />Mexico's top ten business families control almost every industry in Mexico, with market shares ranging between 60 - 80%. U.S. corporate profits average about 12% GDP, in Mexico they're 25%. Economic expansion there in the last decade averaged 3%/year, students there rank near the bottom in international comparisons, and drug violence has been endemic since 2007. China's average wage was about one-third Mexico's in 2002, now is about 13% less. A new antitrust law was passed in 2011, and resulted in a $1 billion fine levied on Carlos Slim's America Movil over termination fees - it remains to be seen whether he'll pay.<br /><br />Russia's government closely controls what is said on TV, but not in the papers. Despite a relatively high per capita income, citizens incur frequent power outages. Moscow and St. Petersburg are connected by a modern rail system from Germany, but the average age of the rest of its rail system is 20 years old, and runs quite slowly. Roads and airports are old. Oil comprises about half of the government's income. Personal income tax rates have been lowered to 13%, and average income is up from $1,500 in the late 1990s to $13,000 currently - double that in China. Between 2003 and 2007 growth averaged 8%/year, with Russian companies doing the best. Pensions were raised from 25% of income to 40% after oil hit $140/barrel; state-owned companies account for 56% of the stock market. (Russia owns 51 - 60%.)<br /><br />Sharma believes it is common for authoritarians in developing countries to extend their power, citing as examples Cameroon, Nigeria, Bolivia, Venezuela, Argentina, and now Russia. (But not China.) Despite Russia having been first into space and has produced 27 Nobel winners in science, mathematics, and economics, it has no global manufacturing companies on its stock exchange. One of its disadvantages is that it is one of the 20 least populated nations in the world, creating logistics challenges, especially for retailing. Nearly 80% of its 100 billionaires (115 in China) reached that status in commodities. Most Russians pay cash to buy a house, small business interest rates run 15 - 20%, its currency was devalued in 1991 and 1998. Bribery is rampant, and direct foreign investment in 2010 was negative. It has one of the world's worst aging problems, and about 40,000 inflow of immigrants/year (mostly Russian-speaking from former satellites).<br /><br />Where are the best places to invest? Sharma's analysis and reporting continues, and he eventually concludes that the Czech Republic, South Korea, Turkey, then possibly Poland, Indonesia, and Turkey are the best candidates. As for the U.S. - he sees a good possibility of a manufacturing revival in lower wage states after 2015, and believes Germany is also well positioned because it has invested in facilities in low-wage European nations.<br /><br />Bottom-Line: 'Breakout Nations' provides interesting introductory material. However, readers should recognize that even if China slows down 3 - 4 percentage points as Sharma predicts, it has become so large that even that will represent sizable aggregate progress. Further, China has been making major strides to move up the value chain - buying Western firms (eg. Volvo), locating facilities in the U.S. (Haier America) and Europe, encouraging/forcing American technology firms to locate R&D and manufacturing in China as a condition for selling in China (G.E., Caterpillar, Intel, etc.), is moving into more complex manufacturing (now the world-leading ship builder, producing heavy construction equipment, wind-power generation, developing CPUs; is a leader in biotechnology research), and dominates the solar power industry. It's not going to fade away, even if its growth rate declines.ge age of the rest of its rail system is 20 years old, and runs quite slowly. Roads and airports are old.

Most Russians pay cash to buy a house, small business interest rates run 15 - 20%, its currency was devalued in 1991 and 1998. Bribery is rampant, and direct foreign investment in 2010 was negative. It has one of the world's worst aging problems, and about 40,000 inflow of immigrants/year (mostly Russian-speaking from former satellites).<br /><br />Where are the best places to invest? Sharma's analysis and reporting continues, and he eventually concludes that the Czech Republic, South Korea, Turkey, then possibly Poland, Indonesia, and Turkey are the best candidates. As for the U.S. - he sees a good possibility of a manufacturing revival in lower wage states after 2015, and believes Germany is also well positioned because it has invested in facilities in low-wage European nations.<br /><br />Bottom-Line: 'Breakout Nations' provides interesting introductory material. However, readers should recognize that even if China slows down 3 - 4 percentage points as Sharma predicts, it has become so large that even that will represent sizable aggregate progress. Further, China has been making major strides to move up the value chain - buying Western firms (eg. Volvo), locating facilities in the U.S. (Haier America) and Europe, encouraging/forcing American technology firms to locate R&D and manufacturing in China as a condition for selling in China (G.E., Caterpillar, Intel, etc.), is moving into more complex manufacturing (now the world-leading ship builder, producing heavy construction equipment, wind-power generation, developing CPUs; is a leader in biotechnology research), and dominates the solar power industry. It's not going to fade away, even if its growth rate declines.
B002RI9HUM|2.0|Couldn't last past 1st chapter! Found it ditzy,, no real story. If a novel hasn't got me in during the first few pages, it's not worth it. This was one such novel. Unimpressed. Won't be searching out this authors work.
B005SODYGA|4.0|Well let me start off by saying ive been a Rammstein fan since i heard there song Du hast... on the movie \\"how high\\".<br /><br />Ok...<br />Now that being said this is my first CD ive purchase{on Amazon} from the group. The CD is full of Rammsteins greatest hits with a cool fold out case. I must say some of the songs on disc #1 i couldve done without but hey overall im really satisfied!!!!<br /><br />Disc #2<br /><br />Disc 2 has all the songs from disc 1 but remixed.<br />I must say i really really enjoyed disc 2 its some really good remixes on here!!! i listen to the remixes more than the originals it has kind of a techno feel.<br />I give the second disc 4.5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />MY ONLY CON.<br /><br />IS that they left out two of my favorite songs!!!!!<br /><br />Which is....(1) Waidmanns heil and (2) Amour<br /><br />Cant wait to see them on tour!!!!!!

1607050072|5.0|I purchased this book for a friend's birthday. When it came in the mail, I did a \\"sneak\\" preview. Now I am sorry I didn't purchase one for myself! The projects look fun, fairly simple and are so original! There are many ideas for sewing,quilting, ornaments, tiny, decorative pillows and something I've been wanting to try, \\"Free-Motion Stitching\\". The author also includes many helpful tips such as creating a binding, using vintage and recycled fabrics and how to organize your crafty space! A really fun and informative book for anyone interested in the art of sewing.

B005D9B26E|2.0|First time I heard this album was in 1980 and thus became the soundtrack of my teen years and young adult life. So when I discovered Quadrophenia was getting the box treatment, I was moderately excited at this release though proceeded with caution. Took a chance and purchased the director's cut on Amazon and upon listening was terribly dissapointed. No where in sight was the OG 1973 mix. The demo discs had Pete add drums played by some unknown to his beautiful demo recordings. Why, who knows. Doesn't add anything. If not taking the time to remaster the OG 73 mix (or at least presenting the entire 96 mix in 5.1) at least a complete live performance from 73, warts and all, could have been considered. Packaging was OK but overpriced considering the Floyd immersion sets are a little nicer and much cheaper. 2 stars for the music, but could easily have been 4 if more considerate.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|What a great read!  My mom purchased this book for her bookclub and was always telling me bits and pieces about it, it sounded extremely interesting, so I picked it up - I couldn't put it down!

B0041B785Y|5.0|Sometimes it can be a drag being a band so influential you literally start a whole sub-genre in the metal world, like we need another one.  Meshuggah are called math metal and spawned what we refer to as djent, a silly term that doesn't make a damn bit of sense to me, anyway.  Other bands came in Meshuggah's wake trying to be spastic, convoluted and heavy.  Some have succeeded, most are just pathetic band wagon jumpers much like all the flannel bands of the grunge era where only two or three outfits ever managed to live into the 2000's.<br />  Meshuggah found themselves in an unenviable position, literally competing against themselves while the whole djent world waited to see what these monsters would give us next.  After the slamming \\"ObZen\\", would they go balls out and try maybe to match the fury of \\"Chaosphere\\", their most brutal album, or venture into experimental territory ala \\"Catch 33\\"?  As it turns out, \\"Koloss\\" reminds me of pieces of all their previous efforts, and is unique in its blend of the twisted arrangements we've come to expect, but also throws in a few tricks this time around.  Drummer extraordinaire Tomas Haake has actually streamlined his rhythms here and there, with a few cuts almost taking on thrash elements with a more conventional beat although no less punishing.  Screamer Jens Kidman tries to throw up his toenails in typical fashion, and Fredrick Thordendahl is always present with his demented lead work.<br />  The one surprise cut here is the last one \\"The Last Vigil\\", a mellow instrumental that really closes the album on a thoughtful note.  It's great to hear these guys apply their chops to something melodic, and they show they can write stuff that is actually quite pretty and not at all out of place.  Frankly, these types of tunes offer much needed texture to any album, and \\"The Last Vigil\\" recalls \\"Destroy Erase Improve\\", which had a nice short instrumental piece on it, too.<br />  Overall, \\"Koloss\\" falls somewhere between \\"Nothing\\" and its lumbering pace and \\"ObZen\\".  In other words, it alternately has slower tempos but then shifts gears into warp speed.  Meshuggah have answered the skeptics and their doubts about Meshuggah's relevance after a few years abscence simply by being themselves, which no other outfit, no matter how hard it tries can do.  It's a must have for all Meshuggah fans.its lumbering pace and \\"ObZen\\".  In other words, it alternately has slower tempos but then shifts gears into warp speed.

0345803485|3.0|This book is good like Cheetos are good.  I loved it.... but there's really no redeeming value here.  I thought the sex scenes were hot, and it was very easy quick reading.<br /><br />Here's the appeal for the middle aged mommy types....  Christian is a sexy billionaire who takes care of everything, and there are no chores, and no kids, just hot sex and luxury living.  What's not to love?<br /><br />What baffles me is why this is suddenly so hot... there are plenty or erotic romance writers who have been writing this sort of thing, and much better for decades.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a really fun, Facebook-style game. I've been playing on my Kindle Fire for a few days with no problems. Today, however, I ran into 2 rather big glitches. First, when I opened it to play, my energy hadn't refilled like it usually does. I exited &amp; came back a little later to full energy, so this appears to be an occasional glitches. Second, nearly all my buildings &amp; all my animals are now set for 75 hrs before I can collect from them. That has pretty much halted my gameplay. Total bummer. Gameloft, fix these glitches, please! It's a fun game otherwise. Would be 5 stars without the bugs.
B0055SWM08|4.0|its all just the same jass.  its just another puzzle game that is fun but if u tat tired of this app than there is about 1000 more that you can try.  all u do is get a bubble to grab whatever it is u need to grab and then that's how u complete the game.  YEAAAA. not really

B000022TSH|5.0|I just wanna know what you're worth. Over 10 million? Chinatown was directed by Roman Polanski in 1974. It starred a prime time Jack Nicholson and leading lady supreme Faye Dunaway. Chinatown is one of the great detective murder mystery movies. It's a very dark noir from start and certainly to finish. Hard boiled detective J.J. \\"Jake\\" Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is investigating a murder mystery conspiracy. The more he learns the more complex the story becomes on every level. It gets real complex when he becomes involved with Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway). The Academy Award winning genius screenplay was written by Robert Towne. Rarely will you find a movie that is this well written. Chinatown is part action, part romance, part philosophical, and part seriously disturbing. Overall this is a very intriguing film. The directorial pace that drives it is truly one of kind. You never know what is going to happen next and then the unthinkable happens.  Chinatown takes place in the 1920s, it was created in the 1970s, but really it could fit right in at any time period. This one is 100% class, suspense, and corruption all the way.<br /><br />Let me explain something to you, Walsh. This business requires a certain amount of finesse.
0345803485|1.0|Upon hearing about this book over and over again across every media outlet available, I decided to give it a try.  I have a few issues with this book:<br /><br />1.  If you are well-read, after 2nd paragraph you will most likely stop reading.....  this is not a piece of literature, it's trash.<br /><br />2.  I don't understand how women across oceans are \\"raving\\" about Christian.  He is creepy, follows Ana around and pigeon-holes her into doing things she knows aren't \\"right\\" by any stretch of the means... just because he's hot?<br /><br />3.  Sounds like emotional/sexual abuse to me... except Ana isn't really strong enough to admit it and follow her heart.<br /><br />WIth that being said, I continue reading.... hoping that a light is shed on this poor girl and that she finds all the things she is looking for.. except now she has a tainted past.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Pink Skulls Book Reviews  [...]    I can't express how much I loved this book!  At first I was a little hesitant to read it.  My first thought was teenage gladiators killing little kids.  Nope, not for me.    I'm glad that I was talked into this book.  I know that a lot of people complained there was \\"No down with the capital\\".  That's not what this book was about though!  This book to me was about everyday people that struggle in life and suddenly, through no fault of there own, are thrust into situations not of their own making.    Basically, Katniss is by no means wanting to be anyone's hero.  All she wants is to bring home enough food to feed her mother and sister.  She's actually chanting in her head during the reaping \\"not me, not me\\".  Now here it is, the situation not of her own making but a government completely out of control.    The games are action none stop.  Spitfire, survivalist, Katniss is all this and more.  The scene with Rue, absolutely touching. I cried!    I wanted to know what the viewers thought of the games but the only hints you get are small tokens from sponsors. SC keeps you completely in the dark on the goings on outside of the Arena.  You are cocooned right along with all the tributes.  I think for me it gave me more of an insight of how they felt.    I bought this book myself
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple. But very well done. I like it. So nice to look at. I like that it trolls you what the best solution possible is
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Pink Skulls Book Reviews  [...]    As of right now I'm on a Zombie kick. This book came highly recommended via my mom. Since, there is a movie coming out with Mr. Delicious himself, Brad Pitt I knew that I wanted to read it.    It was pretty good overall. I had no complaints that the flow of the book was good or what was trying to be said or done wasn't laid out before me. I just find the journalistic style boring. It has already happened and this is what has happened. I'm just not into that.    There were really good stories, that honestly would have been interesting to read about. The kid that didn't have a clue, to glued to the internet to actually look outside his window. His story would have been worth reading. That's what I want in my Zombie stories. The unknown of the survivor! I don't want to know who's going to make it, what has happened by a news report. I like the struggle and fight for survival. Will my main hero make it? I don't know, so don't tell me the climax.    The writing is good and the stories were good, I just wanted the unknown of survival.    I bought this book myself.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Bought the first installment, then didn't want to piece meal the rest so bought the Ominbus version. Very exciting and easy to follow, now waiting for the next set of books. Seems that I have little patience to wait for the story line to continue, just like the Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings, and Eragon books you can lose interest if you have to wait too long to continue the storyline.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire<br /><br />The second book of the Hunger Games trilogy starts off pretty slow, but picks up right after Hunger Games. It begins with Katniss and Peeta during the Victory Tour as well as living the \\"grand life\\" in District 12. Essentially the first half of the book is devoid of action. The remainder of the book deals with the Quarter Quell. There's actually some decent plot twists towards the very end, but it is not enough to compensate for the slow first half of the book.<br /><br />I was able to finish the book in a few days, and again I felt the writing was well done just as it was in Hunger Games. I enjoyed the twist of events, but I still don't quite understand the logistics of the ending but hopefully the third book will fill in those fine details.<br /><br />The Quarter Quell environment is a bit confusing to imagine at first, but they do explain its observed functionality. I am still unsure of how the Gamemakers would realistically or physically create that environment. And if they had this technology for a \\"reality TV show\\", why don't they apply the technology to improving the quality of life in all of the districts??<br /><br />As for the amount of violence in the second book, it is about the same level of brutality as in the first. The deaths are more gruesome though due to the new dangers in the Quarter Quell environment, but it is still on an acceptable level for a young adult reading level. Turn on the news and it is usually more depressing, gruesome, and violent than this book.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really like games like these.  Especially when they don't put the need for other or almost mandatory pay. Also it is easy to pick up and play.

B00285K1KE|1.0|From all the recent MARVEL films, the HULK films are by far the worst ones...The HULK is totally different from the hulk of the comics...I know the movie got to put on real form characters from a magazine, but the story of this Hulk is really uninspired...I mean, who is this Bruce Banner father??? and HULK became childish, without the furor and anger of the comics...In my opinion, the HULK films are not good...try spider man or x men....
1603400265|5.0|TREASURE ISLAND, by Robert Louis Stevenson is a classic story that is a bit difficult to read, but it is an adventurous and interesting book.<br /><br />I recommend this book for boys of 10 and up. It is written in the 1st person, through the eye of the main character, Jim Hawkins. This book is for boys who like adventurers, trip to the open sea and pirates.<br /><br />Treasure Island is a well illustrated and well written story. It is a bit hard to read but it is a good book with a very interesting storyline. I recommend this book.<br /><br />Grade 8 Luis Bordas

B003AVPV1O|4.0|Just a passive splitter, which does its own job. If you use two identical VGA cables it will work fine. If you use two very different (length, impedance or other) cables, it will not work, but this is expected for a passive splitter, thus be warned about this, but do not consider it a \\"bug\\"... it is just physics.

B007MDB71O|5.0|As a Burroughs fan I was worried about what this movie would convey to people who were not familiar with the books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. I was overjoyed as I watched this movie with my 10 year old son - a movie I have been anticipating since I was 13.  There have been some fan trailers (I am sure you can find them on YouTube) which convey the real story of this movie. This movie is true to the original story, for the most part, and hopefully people will see it when it comes out on DVD  Now if we can see a - true to the book - Tarzan movie, that would truly be  an awesome movie. Buy this movie - I really want to see A Warlord of Mars!
B005LJITS0|1.0|ok, the movie visual effects are amazing...the planets, the aliens...everything is really well done visually....but the story and the green lantern themselves are pathetic....Hal Jordan looks and sounds like a goofy teenager who can´t understand what´s going on, and all the development is confusing and mediocre...Really bad! Most movies of today got amazing images, but a really poor story....
B005GUQIDC|5.0|Kimbra's amazing vocal and unique musical style offer a breath of fresh air to the music industry today. She is unique, soulful, extremely talented, sincere, and is not afraid to take risks with her art. I think Kimbra is a force to be reckoned with and I hope people can recognize and appreciate her tremendous talent and originality. The album is absolutely genius, from her vocals, to the production, to her heartfelt lyrics. It is obvious that she is not lacking in honesty and heart when it comes to her music. Granted, there is quite a lot of production and synthesizers on the album but I don't think it's too much... In fact i think we should expect nothing less from Kimbra. She is artistic and adventurous with her music, and the fact is no amount of production could take away from that power house of a voice of hers. Now I personally do prefer some of her songs live, i.e. Wandering Limbs, if you have not seen it, YouTube her live performance of the track for Sideshow Alley. The album version of the song can not compare to the raw emotion and intimacy of Kimbra and Sam Lawrence performing the song in a quiet alley and just the right gust of wind at the right moment setting a mood that just can't be paralleled by studio production. Overall, the album is outstanding, quietly strong, and classically beautiful... The same can also be said for Kimbra herself. I love the album and didn't want it to end. I can't \\"Withdraw\\" her music from my ears.

B0053JJLLC|2.0|Reading this book was like watching a \\"B\\" movie.  Maybe a \\"C\\" movie.  The premise was interesting, but the product delivered was, in a word, boring.  I gave up after reading about 2/3 of the book, meaning I gave it a good try.  It got too silly and I really stopped caring about what happened to the flat, generally unlikable characters.  Once that happened, my \\"so many books, so little time\\" instincts kicked in.

B006M4RN3U|3.0|I had high hopes for this album. And I was disappointed.<br /><br />I've seen the Format live 5 or 6 times, and seen fun. live twice now, so I can say confidently that Nate has the vocal chops to carry these songs without autotune. So why they chose to produce the heck out of some of them until the talent behind them was almost completely lost is a mystery. Seeing them live is still a treat, a far more enjoyable experience than listening to this album. Guess I'll hang my hopes on them releasing a live album.

B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I've watched quite a few Amazon movies in the past two years but this movie was something different so I have to write a review of how much I liked it.<br /><br />I love this movie. I cried man tears a couple times, and I never cry in movies. Last time I cried in a movie was when I saw Ghandi in theaters... except that time was sad tears. This movie made me cry because of how beautiful it was, idk, something hit me like a resonating wave and shattered me and my only response was tears of awe and joy.<br /><br />Truly a transcendant experience.<br /><br />This was just my personal experience, probably won't happen to everyone. No, I did not watch this movie while under the influence of anything, although I imagine that may be quite an experience.
B00756GKBA|5.0|A true masterwork. The sounds and vocals are stunning. The lyrics raw and honest. The whole effect is almost hallucinatory. An album way too sophisticated for a modern. completely dumbed down audience. The corporate stepfords might also be too fat to be able to move to this thing. It's hipper than American audiences have been for decades. Blazing record.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book two. Maybe not the best technical writing ever but a wonderful story.  When Christian hits his knees, broken...my breath hitched and I cried.

B001N44BW0|3.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was the \\"Body of Lies\\" DVD which I picked up at a nearby Ross Store. It was one of those Middle Eastern things (Iraq centered) with a lot of intrigue, death and destruction and all deeply involved with the CIA. Leonardo DiCaprio played an agent situated where the action was whereas Russell Crowe, his main CIA contact, lived back in Fat City (CIA headquarters in Washington) in comfort with his wife and kids. They contacted back and forth through airline flights and ultra-high-end media connections.<br /><br />It was an intriguing movie, and gave interesting insights to the CIA capabilities, if there is any truth at all to the movie. It also went a long way in explaining the size of the CIA budget. The movie flited around geographically from place to place to the point of confusion, although seeing various parts of the Middle East was interesting in itself. The language, particularly associated with DiCaprio, was hampered with the excessive use of F-speak, which added zero to the story and give the film a low-class patina. Be prepared for a certain amount of brutality. A romantic touch was present, but absolutely minimal. Death and destruction were everywhere, including some really spectacular explosions. The movie must have had a high-end budget. There's a lot of action, action, action and boredom never set in, well perhaps a little here and there. The story was not particularly interesting, nor believable, nor well done, however. The script could have used a lot of extra effort. The acting was excellent, however, and the photography and sound were quite good. It was a movie with very mixed qualities.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B0077ATSSQ|2.0|I personally thought that it was not that great. I thought it was too long. I just watched this movie last night was very mad. being a child that lost hid dad in 9/11 I naturally wanted to see it. But was disappointed that it wasnt about 9/11 at all. The kid that acted in this movie is one of the best actors I've ever seen though.
B0062NAVXA|4.0|If you are looking for a movie that will put you on an emotional roller coaster, this is not the movie you! The goal of this movie is to send a message to so called \\"Christian\\" fathers to wake up and do what is expected out of them.  I am not saying that you will not enjoy the movie if you are not Christian; however, if you are not a husband, father, or/and Christian, do not even bother.  If you judge the movie by its production, the movie is \\"B\\" rated.<br /><br />Personally I enjoyed the movie and was comfortable watching this with my family. Again, I did not expect to be moved by special effects or by overpaid actors, I knew the purpose of the movie before I watched this.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Very enjoyable book fast paced and interesting well written, found it very difficult to put it down. Story is set in a futuristic society where 'sameness' has been favoured in terms of individuality but as a result there is littl place for deep feelings such as compassion and empathy and for those who don't fit or are surplus to requirement.....

0439023521|5.0|I honestly HATE reading, always have, I never read books. Give me a book with 100 pages and it will take me 3 months minimum. Then one of my friends recommened it to me. I was like sure, but honestly I was sure i wasnt gonna like it but then....... BAM! Once you pass chapter 4 you eyes LITERALLY cant get off the book. My parents told me to stop reading (surprisingly) so I did, but found my self lost in the amazing book, in less then 2 minutes i started reading again! Its easy to read, not TOO much vocabulary, its for boy and girls! You LITERALLY fall in love witht hte book and the characters.......... im team Peeta ;]  But its sooooooo Intersting I dont know how to describe I would BE in the Hunger Games, kill, die for that book! BEST.BOOK.EVER. Oh i do read class books so I have read many books, just not in my free time
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|game is fun hard to save energy for all tasks without purchasing it but worth the wait to recharge for free it is addicting I find myself checking throughout the day. having a blast!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game and it is nice having such a variety. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Does anyone else see the subtle parallels between Twilight and this book? The way Christian seems to pop up out of nowhere to be at her side, how he tries to warn her away from him, Ana's appreciation for classic books, her clumsiness...<br /><br />The bad: The writing is repetitive at times. Ana can only \\"blush\\" or \\"flush\\" so much before it becomes irritating. We get it... she blushes easily, but having it happen several times within one dialog is really annoying. I can only hope the writing improves in the sequel. There are some geographical problems with the way the author describes the Pacific Northwest. I believe the order from south to north is Portland, Oregon then Vancouver, Washington, then Seattle, Washington. There are also some linguistic problems. Some of the phrases and terms that are used don't seem very likely to be used in America and especially not an urban city like Seattle. I could be wrong.<br /><br />The good: The author created my perfect man. Emotionally unavailable, kinky, and rich (trust me, I know this makes me 50 shades of f***** myself). Even though the writing could use some work, the story is really easy to get caught up in. I read for a long period of time before realizing how long I had been sitting. As the reader, I kept wanting to know more about Christian and the author cleverly only gives you tidbits of information sporadically throughout the book and it leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />So despite the writing quality, I'm still giving this book a reasonably high rating. My highest standard on books is that it keeps me entertained and wanting more.<br />Definitely getting the next book.

B0072GPQ72|5.0|War Horse started as a children's novel in 1982 that more recently became an acclaimed stage show, a BBC radio drama and of course, it gets the full Steven Spielberg treatment in this Best Picture Oscar nominated epic. It's a DreamWorks film, and all of the studio's live action films are released by Walt Disney Pictures.<br /><br />The film combines elements of the book and the stage production, but unlike the other versions, it is not told completely from the viewpoint of Joey, the horse, whose literal narration would not work as well in a film -- but the skill of the trainer, horse and director bring out remarkable \\"acting\\" in the lead equestrian<br /><br />War Horse the movie is perhaps the most Disneyesque motion picture to come from director Spielberg. Especially in its opening segment, taking place in the rugged, breathtaking landscape of Devon and recalling the Disney sagas of yore such as The Three Lives of Thomasina, Darby O' Gill and especially the films Walt Disney produced entirely in the U.K.<br /><br />It's very intense at times, since it is a war film, but the war scenes are heavy on spectacle and light on gore. The most difficult scene to watch, at least in our house, was the fate of the two very young German soldiers, which takes place on camera (and shot in a very evocative way at sunrise in the face of a windmill).<br /><br />Every shot of War Horse is an experience in expert composition, art direction, authenticity and often understated acting. Spielberg, as seen in the very generous bonus materials, is an extremely collaborative filmmaker and knows how to best utilize the finest talent in front and behind the lens, from the superb cast to the stirring music of longtime collaborator John Williams.<br /><br />Rather than have an audio commentary or a simultaneous online compliment to the film itself, the second disc in this four-disc combo is loaded with background material, including a feature length documentary about the making of the film and several shorter items about specific collaborators. Spielberg himself hosts a short round table on camera with members of the cast and crew.<br /><br />Storywise, War Horse suggests an earlier British children's classic, Black Beauty, in that is chronicles the various owners, friends and foes of one particular horse, with a grand coincidence to tie it together. I have to say -- without a trace of irony or sarcasm -- that it also reminds me, in part, of the song \\"Snoopy's Christmas,\\" in which the WWI Flying Ace and the Red Baron suspend their deadly battle for a brief time because of a shared affinity (you'll know which scene I'm referring to if you saw the film already).<br /><br />Since Spielberg and his creative team has meticulously crafted such a sweeping, magnificent film, it follows that it's particularly nice to see it on Blu-ray, which brings out every crag in the rugged countryside and the sheer size of the battle scenes, as well as some very lovely moments at a French country home.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that folks say isn't made anymore and can be a rich experience to share with family and friends.everal shorter items about specific collaborators.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|Love it, use it every day and never have any problems with it. Has lots of useful information and the earthquake map is very interesting.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|Does what it says, but not really worth a dollar. Doesn't do anything that the built in calculator can't do, but it does save some keystrokes if you need to do the same type of calculation over and over. I could see it being useful retailers.  I doubt ill ever use it though.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|it used to work great on galaxy nexus but now it always freezes within a minute. fix that and it will be 5 star!
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I tested this on an iPad 2, and it worked fine.  However, it does NOT work on the iPad 3.  You have to buy a newer version for it to work on the iPad 3.<br /><br />I had to return it - and of course, Amazon's has a great return policy, so there wasn't a problem there.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Not that bad a game.  Good time waster.  Family likes it we will see how long the fun lasts though.

B003EYVXSW|1.0|The overall story and acting is amazing BUT (and that's a big BUT) there is too much gratuitous \\"F\\" bombs and too many sex scenes.  I'm so sorry but I really don't think \\"scientists\\" talk like a pack of sailors and dress like Rockers. The story could have been told without the sex scenes taking several minutes for each one.  Is this an \\"adult film\\" or what? They should be embarrassed because that's the the kinda thing you throw in a movie when the story can't hold up on it's own.  This movie could have until that junk was excessively put in.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|E.L. James' (pen name) female erotic fantasy ,owes its sucess to the fact that it is written from the female perspective and is totally submissive. And for bonus there is bondage.  From the success of such erotica, previously as well, we know that among women. utterly submissive bondage sex is a recurring and abiding fantasy. Women prefer this to dominatrix stuff. And not to be left behind , men obviously  love erotica in which they play the master.  Erika Leonard, real name of James, seems so shy and almost abhores  the erotica she created that she has refused to read aloud from the juicy passages (most passages are) of the novel. Fifty Shades of Grey, is apparently creating ripples among couples who live out the boredom of middle class marriages. But to imagine that half of the western world is out shopping for bondage paraphernalia  is a bit too much and  makes us wonder whether the fight for feminine freedom has finally ended up in chains.  The novel is the story of how a vulnerable young college girl (which college girls isnt?) is lured and trapped in a bondage sexual relationship by who else than a young  tycoon (fantasy, fantasy) who e-mails her detailed bondage contracts as if all the other detailing in the narrative isnt enough. The attempt here is to go into the hidden nooks and cranies of the human mind as well. In that James has succeeded.  Purveyors of the good old soft erotica will wonder what will happen to the  old missionary position and whether  tying up the young giri and whipping her with leather  is a prerequisite for getting her interested.  If you want to get tied up in all this, Shades of Grey is a good early night read. Otherwise look for the good old stuff, where all you need to dangle is a good poem and not whips and chains and the girl will wither in any case.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|You have to get points to access more levels. Playing the already open levels gives slow accrual of points. Faster ways are to do reviews (like this),  buy points, download and play other games, and apply for (and get approved) for credit cards. It is an interesting tactic. But most of the levels are fairly fun.
B0055SWM08|1.0|don't waist ur time. worse than soap operas. waist of my money and my life. not fun at all. p
0439023483|1.0|My wife and I tried to listen to this on a long drive. It started really slowly, painfully slow. Once it began to get somewhat interesting, the story became so blatantly predictable, I could not bear to continue. The book is written in a way that is sophomoric at best. The story line is poorly constructed, and the detail is fragmented.<br /><br />With all the fuss about the movie, we were intrigued to hear the writers story. I don't watch movies at all, so I cannot compare how the two are alike or not.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this one, as we did. A real flop.
B0055PMURG|5.0|Soul Surfer is in the top 10 of my favorite faith-based movies. It really is a tremendous uplifting film that leaves you in tears from the very beginning to the very end. And it's all attributed to God. Kudos to Dennis Quaid and Helen Hunt for being in the film and giving terrific performances! I give Soul Surfer a 10 out of 10<br /><br />My top 10 faith-based movies of all time are: 1) Ben-Hur; 2 Soul Surfer; 3) Suing the Devil 4) Facing the Giants; 5) Chariots of Fire; 6) End of the Spear; 7) The Climb; 8) Gospel of John; 9) Time Changer; 10) Book of Matthew<br /><br />You're missing out if you haven't seen these films!

B002MQYOFW|3.0|Well I finally conceded and read this book.  While it was interesting enough it definitely did not live up to the hype.  It was much better than the movie however so kudos for that.  But I found the book a bit lacking and at times I just couldn't keep engaged.  All in all it was worth the read but when a book is hyped this much I guess you just expect more.
B002V092M4|5.0|I've re-read \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" by John Le Carre a number of times and still enjoy this beautifully written classic in the spy-thriller genre. This is a complex plot with many characters demanding close concentration on the part of the reader. The characters are wonderfully constructed and described by the author, creating vivid images of the scenes as the plot is revealed through the dialogue. I enjoyed the film, too. Excellent book. Justly deserves five stars!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book because my daughter had to read it in school, and when the movie was set to come out, she wanted to go and see it.  Boy, was I in for a pleasant surprise!  She had the whole family (adults) reading it!  I couldn't put it down and was on the edge of my seat during the whole read!  I'd recommend to anyone!

B004UID2LC|1.0|It's kinda funny but if you look at all these 5 star positive reviews to this program, all the reviews  sound identical and they're all written the same. the damn developer is reviewing his own application! this is pathetic. just download tubemate.
B004JPJHME|5.0|This is the best release of the movie i've seen so far. It's packed with a lot of extras and an amazing quality. The colors are natural and look flawless. The audio is terrific. Im simply amazed by the quality of this Criterion release.
B004QL7K6G|2.0|When a pair of New Yorkers are unexpectedly unemployed, they set out for his brother's home in Georgia. There is an entertaining travel montage: they sing, argue, sleep, and take turns driving. They stay for one pleasant night at \\"Elysium,\\" a Utopian camp along the way, but continue on to the home of the successful brother and his semi-catatonic wife. It doesn't take long for us to understand why she is in that condition; he is hateful, short-tempered, rude and selfish. Our horrified couple flees back to the Utopian camp.<br /><br />Just let me caution you: This is a Judd Apatow-produced movie, so some of you shouldn't read any further because there will be raunch, nudity, profanity, nudity, fart jokes, nudity, diarrhea jokes, and a whole herd of elderly nudists running down a hill toward the camera. Get the DVD from Amazon.com so you can fast forward!<br /><br />If you're gonna go there, these are the folks you'll meet:<br />  * Paul Rudd (\\"Our Idiot Brother\\") is the hapless New Yorker who is commanded to experience free love with a beautiful blonde. You won't expect his reaction.<br />  * Jennifer Aniston (\\"Horrible Bosses\\") is the distaff side of the unemployed couple. She isn't too bad in this one.<br />  * Justin Theroux (\\"Your Highness\\") is the spokesman and guru for the commune. He gets dibs on our heroine right away!<br />  * Alan Alda (\\"Tower Heist\\") is one of the founding members of the commune. If only he could remember where he put that deed!<br />  * Ken Marino (lots of TV) is that vile brother. Marino is also one of the scriptwriters.<br />  * Joe Lo Truglio (\\"Paul\\") is the first person they meet at the commune. We see a LOT of Joe! (Remember I mentioned nudity?)<br /><br />By the time we have explored \\"free love\\" and all the eccentricities and hypocrisies of the various occupants, I found myself becoming more and more impatient, so I was happy when our hero finally pops his cork and tells them off. He speaks for all of us and we agree with him wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Paul Rudd is a handsome, capable actor who has found himself in a bit of a rut. He is evidently a great improviser and I suspect his scene talking dirty to himself in the mirror was improvised. I'm sure the crew was cracking up (I wasn't!); the screening audience of young adults loved it.<br /><br />At least Jennifer Aniston was able to cast her boyfriend (Justin Theroux) in this one...sigh... Okay, I'll admit it. I laughed out loud...once....
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read 50 Shades of Grey after reading multiple reviews and debating whether I was going to spend the money on this trilogy.  I always look at the five star reviews through the 1 star reviews, and questioned whether I should spend the money on this trilogy based on the same, I ultimately decided to go for it because the good reviews seemed to win out over the bad.  I truly liked book one, and would give it 4 stars (you really have to knock my socks off for a five), while it is not a literary work of art, it was a good ride and I became attached to the characters and all of their excentricities.  After the end of book one, I had to read book two, which again I enjoyed, but found it very very very very very very very repetitive.  Again, I was able to get past the use of the same descriptions over and over again, and the way that the characters continued to address their issues in a circular way, because I enjoyed the characters and the continuation of the story, but it began to become monotonous and was not the page turner that book one had been for mre.  Since I had already bought all three, I continued with book three.  Initially, I was encouraged by James' use of flashbacks, and point of view of someone other than Ana.  That quickly changed to more of the same from the first two book.  It was as if two different people wrote book three, every 50 pages you got a little excitement and furtherance of the plot other than Christian and Ana's constant banter, but then it was back to the same.  The development of the relationship between Christian and Ana as well as the other characters is enjoyable, but terribly drawn out and repetitive in nature.  The long and short of it is if you cannot look past the repetitive nature of this author's writing, these books are not for you no matter how good the ride is.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Who doesn't like cute jumping leperchauns? Takes a little getting used to,  but overall fun and simple gameplay. I enjoyed it a lot.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|So fun!!!!!!!!!!i am so addicted to this! totally get this game,, i love it. My husband got it too and he loves it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|There should be an easier way to get friends for the game. All you can do is request to all of facebook.. you should have a place where people can go to individually request friends. I have none so cant visit other farms or get energy.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire was a great read. I liked it better than the third in the trilogy. Finally heros we can root for.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I basically enjoyed the book, and now feel compelled to read a straight history about WW1 and the Russian revolution.  There may have been a bit too much emphasis on the characters we get to know, but through them we do get a sense of the possible thoughts during this period.  I look forward to ordering the 2nd book when it appears.  Follet's very best work though was the Pillars.....an outstanding book!
B00002N9ER|4.0|Now these Brackets are worth the cost . I used them to mount my 4D size Maglight on my crash bar of my Harley . Have not had any issues and I ride all over the place . Just zip tied them on and cliped in flashlight.

B007IYWY3C|5.0|Every Florence and the Machine fan needs to by this Unplugged Cd. I really like the versions of the songs on this cd. So far my favorite is the Johnny Cash song \\"Jackson\\" she covers with Josh Homme. I don't need to say her voice sounds great because you guys all know Florence powerful voice. This will be playing in my car for a while!
B003ELY7PG|4.0|The book contains lots of interesting little bits of advice in running a company. At times there is too much similar just stacked on top of each other. As always, doing is more important than reading about it.
0307592731|5.0|After her mother died quickly of cancer when Cheryl was only 22, all four wheels came off. Overwhelmed by her grief, she veered off into a perfect storm of bad decisions around sex, alcohol, drugs and the trajectory of her life. Without ever spending one night backpacking, she undertakes a 1,100-mile, solo hike with her \\"Monster\\" pack and boots a size too small in an attempt to take back her life. This masterful storyteller recounts her odyssey with unblinking honesty in a voice that convinces you she's your new best friend. This is one of the hottest books out there and deservedly so - it's going to be bigger than \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" not only because it's better written by several orders of magnitude but because you can feel Cheryl's irresistible heart beating powerfully on every page.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A fun and addictive sequel to Oregon Trail! Another game that relies on waiting for &quot;energy&quot; to regenerate, but overall a very fun game!
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|There is definately a 'learning curve' with this bottle cutter.  So far, have had a 50% win/loss rate. I will have several bottles turn out well, and then for no apparant reason, the next several will not cut straight at all, and it is frustrating. The ones that cut right are really nice, but it is not as easy as it would seem. Practicing takes MANY bottles, so start cleaning off those labels and be ready for lots of rejects along with  your successes! Good idea needs improvement.

B004DNWPY4|5.0|This book was dry but still very good. I liked the examples, and the overall book did raise some very good questions. I thought it was a compelling read, one which helped me consider my own relation to wealth.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|The animation is better than any I've ever seen before. Since I have watched this with interruptions with my nine year old I'm going to watch again. I can only imagine this was probably better in 3d. Not even the Lorax matches up to this. It almost looks real. The people, and the sea. It wouldnt even be wasted time to watch again. Just love both the plot, and the uniqueness of this animation.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is very interesting and keeps me thinking.  What an ingenuous game.  I'm very glad that I took advantage of the free app for this one!
0545265355|4.0|This was required reading for my Children's Literature class.  If not for that I don't know if I would have heard about the book before the hype about the movie.  Since the book was writen for kids (5th grade reading level)I was concerned about the plot conflict. Based of the rules of the games, I expected a real moral dilemma for the protagonist, but felt the author let her off easy. I suppose that is a good thing though, as you don't want the hero to be a cold hearted killer of childern. However, does the story justify murder, since Katniss only kills the \\"bad kids\\" and all the other \\"good kids\\" are killed by the \\"bad kids\\".<br />I have only read the first book, which was such an easy read that I read the 384 pages in one setting, but I hear the 2nd book is the best.  I can only hope that the people of the districts uprise against the bored, obnoxious people of the capital and justice prevails.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game. Look forward to more. I play this before work. Better than coffee. Only problem is it could use further difficulties.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|My review is a summation of what I felt about the Fifty Shades trilogy.<br /><br />I give Book 1, four stars. Book 2 about 3.5 stars. Book 3, 3 stars.<br /><br />Well, Where do I start? Do I listen to my inner goddess and say I never wanted Fifty Shades to end because I love Christian's and Ana's characters so much?<br /><br />Or shall I listen to my subconscious, and say well, enough sex, enough contrived situations, and finish the book already! And I believe it should have finished at Book 1, or at the most, a Book 1.5.<br /><br />First of all, although I love Fifty Shades, I can't understand the hype. It is good, but not earth-shattering to garner such overwhelming response, especially for Book 2 and Book 3.<br /><br />The first book captures your attention. You become vested in Ana's story. An innocent woman being slowly drawn into the dangerous web of the damaged, but charismatic billionaire, Christian Grey.<br /><br />You feel Ana's joy, confusion and anxiety as she deals with her 'Fifty'.<br /><br />The character of Christian is so well-written. He is a tortured soul who hides his fears behind his 'control freak' facade -- his need for absolute possessiveness and control.<br /><br />In fact, I felt the ending of the first book was honest, and I felt that the book would have been more believable if it had ended there. But I admit, I am a sucker for the happily-ever-after ending.<br /><br />The twisted relationship made it difficult to read.<br /><br />It was so overwhelming, as I felt the noose tighten around Ana's neck. She loves him, but how to deal with him? Some would label it an emotionally abusive relationship.<br /><br />It left me so drained that I had to stop reading it for a while and I moved on to other books before I came back to pick up where I had left off.<br /><br />In Book 2 and Book 3, I felt there were certain contrived situations just to make the story interesting: Ana's kidnapping, her vindictive boss, the sabotage of Tango Charlie and Christian's mad ex-sub, to name a few.<br /><br />And for a person who has such an elaborate security detail, it amazes me that Christian's apartment gets broken in so easily.<br /><br />The sex? Okay, in Book One, it was interesting as it was pivotal to the story, but after that I felt it was just a bonk fest that got so repetitive.<br /><br />In fact, I used to skim the pages just so that 1 could get on with the story. Hence my belief that everything could have been nicely concluded in Book One.<br /><br />But what did I love? What did I truly enjoy reading in all the three books?<br /><br />It was not even the sex. But what I loved most was Christian and Ana's e-mail correspondences. It was touching and funny. I loved Ana's inner goddess.<br /><br />And I love the author's writing style. I will definitely be waiting for her next book!
B0070Z4M4I|2.0|Slurpy, icky, dumb.  Not quite as stupid as the totally whacked-out, F-minus, retarded, Kurt Russell version (what the heck?), but still pretty disappointing.  It really Tries to become good, at several points - but the whole story line flow is so choppy and the general intelligence of the construction is so floppy, that you just want to stare out the window and throw up.  Now - you want to see an Awesome remake?  Check out Keanu Reaves' \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" or Tom Cruise's \\"War of the Worlds\\".  THOSE are good movies.  The cretins involved with these \\"The Thing\\" remakes, however, apparently have some weird retardo fixation on big, floppy wormy monster things.  Maybe their daddys made them eat worms as kids when they went fishing as punishment for not catching enough fish?  Or maybe they currently have some sort of spastic colon or duodenumic disease and are tormented at night with intestigut monsters floppily, sloppily attacking them?  Or...maybe their I.Q. is simply minus 74.  Who can know these things?  Maybe they voted for Obama or Clinton and their brains have become half-eaten away as a result of a rare kind of subconscious self-flagellation where they've auto-infected their brains with Amazonian pinworms or something. Which in itself could be good material for a movie.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome... souled recommend to anyone with a kindle fire..once you get used to the controls you cant put it down
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|It is that good. You have to listen to it a couple of times but all the great music gets better the more you listen.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The game intro is great. It really helps get you used to different objects and how they work. During the game, you can lose track of time as the interface is simple, but elegant, and the music is very tranquilizing.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I have not seen a comedy this funny in quite some time. It exceeded my expectations in every way. I highly recommend it.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|It was a great book to open your mind to the various running styles out there. It was also cool to learn about the Tarahumara. I am sad to know that Caballo Blanco just passed away while out running. :(
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Same old Bird tossing and only 2 levels for $2.99!?? Very lame, redundant and disappointing.  buy something else if you like money
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The program is the best Bible program for a tablet I have see yet.  extremely well written. The only major downside is that the program is always on-running in the background.  This is not good since on tablets you have limited system &amp; memory resources.  Also there is no way to stop the program from running.  It also occasionally opens up annoying messages asking if you want to start a Bible reading plan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed The Hunger games very much.I didnt want to read it as I am 71 and thought it would be geared more toward the younger generation . I started and couldnt put it down and immediately order the next 2 books.<br />It was the first book I  read on my Kindle and I cannot leave my house without my Kindle.
B005TZFZJC|3.0|I got this for Christmas and I listened to it. I hardly listen to it now. This CD is basically all about sex and dirty-dancing. To me, it's not her best. Her best,by far is \\"Loud\\". Nothing can beat that CD to me.<br /><br />  Other than the CD, it's packaging is flawless. It features a booklet,poster,sample of her best-selling fragrance \\"Reb'l Fluer (which smells wonderful, almost like vanilla)& 2 album cover trading cards.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I've had a Nook for just a few months and an Android tablet for just a few weeks, so I'm relatively inexperienced.  This app is the first out of about 40 or 50 that has been a problem on either device.  It took an unusually long time to download, as other owners have indicated.  Now I can't get it to run.  Attempts to interact with the screen result in white blocks on the screen, and it locks up.  Hope an update is in the works that will fix the problem.  It looked like an entertaining app.  I'm reluctant to &quot;rate&quot; a product I haven't used.
0439023521|4.0|Fell into the craze a little late in the game. The Hunger Games tells of a North America transformed into twelve districts surrounding The Capitol. This Capitol unleashes its control of the districts by having an annual, televised battle-to-the-death between a boy and a girl from each district.<br /><br />Katniss is our heroine. She's a very capable hunter who must take care of her younger sister, Prim, and battered mother.<br /><br />When Prim is selected as the girl contender from their district, Katniss volunteers instead. The rest of the story is how this Hunger Game unfolds.<br /><br />First and foremost I did not like how this book ended. It's probably because Collins planned for the trilogy but the end of the book is just the end of a chapter. I wanted some kind of resolution.<br /><br />To be sure, The Hunger Games ends but before the book is over, Collins has us continuing the story.<br /><br />That's my only beef with this story and it is a very small beef (ala McDonalds). The rest of the plot is engaging.<br /><br />As told in first person from Katniss's point of view, you go along with her thoughts and are never privy to outside information. This keeps the tension high as you will never know what's going to happen next. You don't even know if Katniss will survive. It's all up in the air.<br /><br />The characters are not fully fleshed out with this first book. There are a few moments when Katniss and her counterpart, Peeta, do some reminiscing. This helps add some meat to their character bones. I'm assuming we'll delve deeper as the books go along.<br /><br />The violence is interesting. Having twelve through eighteen-year olds tossed into an arena and hunt/murder one another is slightly disturbing and the fact that it has caught fire may say something about our society. But I don't remember graphic descriptions. In fact, I think it was a matter of Collins writing toward our imagination and letting us fill in the detail.<br /><br />I was also impressed with the lack of swearing. This is a fad that seems to infect ninety-five percent of Young Adult novels. I don't remember any use of profanity. You'd think the kids would be spouting them left and right considering their situation.<br /><br />In the end (outside of the ending) Collins has started a very rich world. I look forward to what happens next.
1591843162|5.0|Seth Godwin must have special powers -- powers of vision! In LINCHPIN Godwin draws a picture, describing how institutions -- schools, buinesses -- should be structured. Say good-bye to students' desks in rows, expecting students to obey every little rule created \\"for their own good,\\" making them compliant robots for the world of work in the factory. Say good-bye to punching the time clock, working in one setting for 40 years, only to get a gold-plated watch.<br />  Godwin describes a world of work and school that prepares individuals, using their creative side. (All of us have it; too bad it's been crushed, smothered by the status quo.) The only problem with this book is that the reader stands a good chance of wanting to kick himself/herself in the butt for not having been exposed to this natural kind of thinking much earlier. Maybe it's not too late!?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is a lot of fun. it keeps me occupied when I wake up in the middle of the night and cant fall back asleep :)
0439023521|5.0|uh oh, I can't put this book down! Thought it was just a lot of hype, but this is a good read! NIce flow to the story and great characters. Soon be ready for the next two!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Best weather app with so many pieces of info I'm still discovering them!  It is so accurate and offers so many options!  LOVE IT!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Beautifully designed game and lots of fun. I will definitely keep an eye out for any apps this developer releases.
B0076L9W9Q|4.0|This is a good album, especially for a sophomore effort.  It's not quite as strong as their first album, but it is still definitely worth buying.  Lzzy Hale still showcases her incredibly strong vocals - I can't believe that anyone has a voice that powerful and in tune at the same time.  It's not electronic altering either; she sounds the same live, too.  While Halestorm's first album was dominated by a hair band sound, this album doesn't have an overarching style.  The first few songs start rocking hard - almost Pantera-ish.  In my opinion, this is the best part of the album.  Next, there are series of ballads, which aren't as strong as the first few songs.  There's even one that sounds like a pop song.  The style switches again and gets a little harder but not as hard as the first few songs.  While none of the songs are bad, they don't seem like they all belong on the same album.  Still, this is definitely worth the money.
0345529057|5.0|Book set arrived earlier than expected, in excellent condition. Packaging kept the books safe during travel. The books are paperback (as promised) but are sturdy and handy for my busy lifestyle.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|Fun movie, Its a chick flick but its funny so most guys will tolerate it. not for kids under 16.
0375869026|5.0|Ditto to many of the other reviews I have read. With all the anti-bullying messages being promoted of late, the story is particularly timely. I read the book out loud to my 5th grade class and we all found it to be funny, sad and an excellent starting point for conversations about what it means to be different, and how it feels to be bullied.<br /><br />Part of the appeal comes from R.J. Palacio's use of multiple first-person narratives. The book tells about Auggie's experiences before school starts, during school, and at particular events such as Halloween and a Science project. These stories are told initially from Auggie's point of view, then his sister's, then other friends/foes and family.<br /><br />The writing is clean, the dialogue realistic, and the story simply WONDER-full. A well-deserved 5 stars.
B007R41E8O|1.0|what a waste of money at any price. all I got was a seemingly endless download message.  same thing over and over. downloading 350.5 Mb then when that was done it did a check of 572 Mb then when that was done it went back to the download of the 350.Mb again. it did that several times before I got tired of it and uninstalled. I will not buy another.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|lots of fun! its so much like mario! im addicted! i am going to tell every one to download and play!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Entertaining and easy to play. Great interface. I play on my Kindle Fire. Runs smoothly. Lots of levels. I'd even say it is pretty.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|As others have mentioned you cannot access all of the games when you begin playing. however I liked this feature since it makes you master a few at a time before moving on. a great time waster!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game... my kids love to help me figure out what needs to be done.. fun fun fun!!! would recommend to anyone.. great way to pass some time.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I like the game a lot. It reminds me if Super Mario. its cool.  I think there are more people out there if they tried it that they would get hooked on it too.
B000002G1Y|5.0|I've always been fascinated by Hiatt's voice--snarly, nasal, twangy; like he swallowed Keith Richards whole with a bottle of bourbon and wouldn't spit him out--but, other than hearing him on the radio and on PBS, I've not been familiar with his recordings (other than the song \\"Cry Love\\", which is so sui generis that my fascination's held only tighter--like a five year old who wonders what, exactly, are those noises coming from his parent's room late at night).<br /><br />Well, here I am reviewing the first and only complete recording of his that I've heard and, having just finished the entire CD, it feels a bit post-orgasmic. My take on this effort? Strap yourself in and be prepared for whiplash. This thing rocks from beginning to end, all twelve songs, and grabs you by the balls and doesn't let go (sorry girls). That voice, those guitar riffs, those snorts and cries---this guy's got it all and makes some new kind of sound; it's rock n' roll smashing into rockabilly careening off rhythm and blues, making something quite all it's own (Hiatt and roll, perhaps?)<br /><br />Wow! This things got twelve legs and then some. Two songs, \\"Something Wild\\" and \\"Buffalo River Home\\", are so good I played them over and over just to feel their bone rattling rhythms like kicks in the head. Even the slower tempo numbers rock and vibrate your brain.<br /><br />As for me, I'm moving on to all his other CDs. I'm now an unrepentant addict.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|For me this was the best book of all times. It can be a little graphic, so young children should not read it in my opinion. But kids from age 16 and up would enjoy it. I have read the whole series twice. I had a hard time putting the book down once it got going. It pulls at the heart strings but also gives the person reading the need for survival. Do you go after the packs and weapons in the center or do you do what your mentor says and run as far as you can and find water. Do you play along with the other tribute in your district or do you go off by yourself. Do you team up with someone from another district or do you continue to play by yourself. Would you do everything in your power to stay alive... even kill another person if that meant you get to go home.<br /><br />I would also recommend to read the other two books.<br /><br />HAPPY HUNGER GAMES AND MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a fun game for many different ages. this game is easy to play on all different types of electronics.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this was a great purchase and so much fun. time goes buy quickly. really like this game. not really made for kids under 4 but mine still tries and she likes to tell me when I miss one. :)
B007RV5T1U|3.0|I don't mean she herself is not pretty, for she is very beautiful.  And the women's costumes for dancers are extremely<br />pretty if not beautiful; they are like pretty flowers and butterflies.  I mean that the dancing style itself, to me, is<br />not pretty.  It is not balletic, or graceful, but rather very strong and fierce and almost threatening or at times seems<br />dysfunctional or disabled and very labored. I guess it is not my style to enjoy.<br /><br />I have seen quite a lot of dance in my times but never anything quite like this.  It is a surprise.  I will watch it again<br />and see what I feel next viewing.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|The movie arrived quickly.  It was in good shape because it was well wrapped. I have not watch the movie yet.
B0043X1FOK|5.0|The first Short Circuit is great.  Short Circuit 2 is amazing.  I love the robot.  He talks, walks, and puts himself back together after he gets shot by several people. He is Johnny and he is alive.
B007JF87VS|5.0|This episode is full of action and leads you up to a startling new character that will appear in Season 3. For those who have read the comics, she is finally here). Can't wait for next season.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had never heard of Hugh Howey until I read about the Wool series in a blog post. I was intrigued by the blurb, so I got the book. I absolutely couldn't put it down. The description and dialogue were amazing and the characters were so well-written that they felt like real people. Although the post-apocalyptic theme is very common right now, this book has an original take on it and the characters really make Wool stand out.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is fun and the graphics are great.  add me tardisintime. better than facebook games. so much fun. a++++
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Challenging enough to keep it interesting. Nice change of pace on my Galaxy Player 5. Somewhat slow to load but  recommended.
B005LA3Z9M|4.0|I loved this book. Such an interesting concept to base a novel on. Beautifully written and the main character was compassionately portrayed, although at times irritating.  I have recommended this book to my friends.
B0055SWM08|5.0|- Starts off easy but needed hints for a few.  Could stand some changes, like getting rid of the border around the playing field so we remember the drop can go off the side.  Also, when completing a level, can't replay right away when New Level words block previous board.  But that's all minor.  Setting it inside a beautiful house is great!
014241722X|3.0|As others have noted, this is a book about a 13-year old and decidedly seems to be written for 10-15 year olds. Good of its kind, but not the vintage Grisham for adults.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A tranquil and challenging puzzle game. Charming yet soothing all at once.  I'm delighted with the play and look forward to the sequel.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like how it has a 2D game scroller and how it is like super Mario but your not a plumper you are a leprichan.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|it is a great game and worth the price. runs smoothly on kindle fire but takes up a ton of space
B007EC27QM|3.0|It's a basic calculator.  Fairly large keys and display, so I'm not sure what those complaints were about.  I'd have rated it higher if I understood why a calculator requires network access.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I thought -this was.a great game it was also awesome and cool Ps you should download and give a great review
B007PTJOV0|5.0|OMG IT IS THE FUNEST APP I EVER PLAYED I HOPE IT NEVER ENDS I HOPE IT KEEPS GOIN TIL ITS DEADED OUT
B005UG542S|4.0|As previously stated for another related product. This is a Great price for the 3d bluray boxset worth every penny. great movie. buying this or these type of products represents good value for your money.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|I hate this game, but I totally hats the cover. That guy has the stupidest face(expression) and what's he doing with his hands?dancing? I'm not trying to be funny its just that the cover it annoys the crape out of me. and I have to see it everyday.
B0058BIAK8|5.0|We've had this box set for a few weeks now and are really enjoying it. We usually watch a couple of episodes before going to bed. A really good laugh seems to help us sleep better. Funniest sit com around at the moment.
B0057ZEMF2|3.0|What a shame! A superb musical performance marred by the audio compression that is unnecessary in a CD format. I was hoping for something that would rise above the mediocre MP3 format. \\"Lossless\\" recordings are a waste of money when the recording is compromised by loss of dynamics. If this keeps up, I will have to find another way pick my music. I would prefer to listen and buy but that is no guarantee when discovery is via the internet.<br /><br />I would still recommend a listen via streaming via Slacker Radio, etc. on the internet or downloading the MP3 if you like that format. It is some of the most interesting and unique music I have come across this year.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Firstly, when was the last time you saw a sci-fi film in which humans aren't necessarily portrayed as the good guys, and don't necessarily win the day? Those who criticise the clichéd plot obviously are not aware that many films copy the plot of others; a conflicted protagonist wrestling with his conscience is a common device. For example, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is a retelling of SEVEN SAMURAI (I saw elements of the Tom Cruise film, THE LAST SAMURAI in AVATAR, too). It may be a hackneyed plot, but this isn't a legitimate criticism. Secondly, the CGI is so good that for once you actually forget about it; it settles into your subconscious and you accept it. The so-called 'emotion capture' is so good that you engage completely with the characters and forget they are CG. You stop looking for those tell-tale hints that it's not real and you go with it. In so many CG-heavy films this isn't the case, and so it's a testament to Cameron and his army of CG artists who made this possible in such a visually arresting, ground-breaking way.
0545265355|4.0|This trilogy was fun to read! Definitely for young adults but had some interesting twists and turns. A clever take on what our future may hold for us. These novels hopefully will help the younger adults appreciate all they have and also our wonderful planet we live on.
B005J32Y6Q|5.0|The 3D disc is a must for Michael Flatley fans and well worth forking out for a 3D compatible T.V. How does he do it, spectacular, sharp and as always the Flatley magic.<br />He conquers the night with his unique dancing ability, special effects, and of course his dancing cast who are impeccable and a joy to watch.<br />This must be one of the only productions were you want to stand up in your living room and shout and clap after the breathtaking production you have been fortunate enough to watch. Well done Michael you make people happy and put a smile on their face. Go on its Christmas give yourself a treat.<br />XXXXX XXXX XXXXX
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Though it is similar to Frontierville, THO: American Settlers is much more fast paced and more fun than its rival. 5 stars all the way.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I got this app when it was free a couple days ago and it is nothing shorter then great. The gameplay is intuitive and the levels are plentiful, but when makes me like it the most is the music. The music is nothing less then superb. The piano music at the beginning was just so great, I had to give this 5. I haven't had any annoyances concerning reviewing this app, so I just had to give this a 5.
B002SQ364Q|5.0|I saw this movie several years ago on HBO and loved it. I was surprised there wasn't more music in it but it was the back story that was this movie, not the music. I was actually glad the concert/music was the background and not the focus of the movie. Excellent and nostalgic! Wish I'd gone!!
B007HJ84WS|3.0|Immortal not!  Memorable also not!  Too bad hollywood has given up acting and actors for CGI.  Perhaps they should give the cartoonists some decent food so that they do not have nightmares and a sour outlook on life.
0345803485|1.0|I felt compelled to warn others to not listen to the hype.  This is truly the worst book I've read in a long time...well sort of read. I couldn't finish it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is one of the best time management games available in the app store. It is fun and easy to play and best yet, I don't have to annoy everyone with constant requests to &quot;send &quot; me items!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A really fun and even possibly an educational game. Highly recommend to all game players out there. My power gaming son got me hooked. I do wish the energy level grew a little faster.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Was fun until it made my kindle crash and became too glitchy to continue playing. Would cause the top half of the game to become unselectable making it nearly impossible to exit the game without restarting the device, and wait times jumped to over 150 hours for crops or money or items. Too bad as the game was really enjoyable.
0345803485|4.0|OK- disclaimer- I am  67 a female, wife, mother of 3, grandmother of 4. I have always liked mysteries, novels, good literature , and in the past soft porn. I belong to 2 book clubs, play bridge, golf, knit, garden, and I am still working. Having said all that I really liked this book/story.I have recommended it to friends and daughters ( and son)-the story is far-fetched but who cares! The characters are developed enough to care about and the sex is enjoyable if not exactly to my taste. When this becomes a movie I would recommend Snow Patrol (esp. Just Say Yes and Calling Out In The Dark)  as part of the musical background.Their melodic gritty sound would be perfect for the angst Christian and Ana are dealing with. The romantic in me wants to see them together but  anything goes. I can,t wait until the 17th.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is a very good game it is just like Mario. if you like Mario than get this game. the only thing different about it is because it has a lepracaun in it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a awesome game and this can intertane you when you are bored and when you dont want ti do something else you can play cut the rope.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game! I have it on my droid and my kindle. The only bad thing is i have not found a way to connect to the one on my phone. is there a way??!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|y u no get it yet it awesome and works great on the kindle fire. great for all ages and when you get it add me as a friend would you please
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Overall the Kindle app works great: it's easy to read books on the go without much eye strain. But there are a few problems.<br /><br />Covers: Book covers don't display properly for some Kindle books purchased through Amazon, and almost all MOBI books purchased direct from a publisher. But this is inconsistent - some of the book covers display, some don't, and some start off not displaying and then display later. This has been a known issue for at least two major version releases and should be a simple fix - still broken. You can workaround this using the Send to Kindle PC software, but it's an unnecessary extra step.<br /><br />Skipped lines: Occasionally a line in a book will end up below the screen on one page, then be skipped entirely on the next page. The app is getting better at this though.<br /><br />Syncing: As someone else mentioned, syncing between the app and another Kindle works great, except when a Table of Contents is at the back of a book. Then, syncing is broken entirely. A method to set the current location / furthest page read would be excellent.<br /><br />None of this should deter you from using the app, and if Amazon fixes these issues I'll gladly upgrade my rating to five stars.
B007R41E8O|5.0|good graphics. decent story line and hours of fun for less than a buck! I enjoyed this hidden object game a lot more than others that cost a lot more. items are not overly easy to find and mini puzzles are challenging but not so hard that you get totally stuck. plus you have hints available anytime you need them so you never have to feel totally frustrated. would love to see more like this one for such a reasonable price!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun. interesting.  similar to super Mario.  kills time. id reccommend this game. there's worse app games out there. try it. great game for when you're on the crapper.  your legs might go numb though from playing so long.
006197806X|4.0|Review: SPOILERS!! Pandemonium may be just one of the many dystopian/post-apocalyptic novels we have seen recently; however, it will always stick out to me simply because of the complexity of Lauren Oliver's writing.<br /><br />I admit, it took me a while to get into the groove of this book. The chapters alternate between \\"now\\" and \\"then\\" and I had a hard time figuring out when was now and what was then. Yes, slightly confusing. About mid-way into the story I felt more comfortable with that structure. It gave us a glimpse of what Lena is doing now, compared to where she was once she first got into the Wilds. Lena \\"then\\" was more weak, a bit whiny, and sort of got on my nerves. Then again, she is dealing with the fact that Alex is not with her so I tried to understand her struggles to fit into this foreign world.<br /><br />If anything, Lena's time in the Wilds showed her exactly what she needed to survive. She learned how people take care of each other and the true dangers of living away from everything she knew.<br /><br />The \\"now\\" part of the story takes place months later with Lena in New York. I won't go into a lot of details of this section because it was part of the surprise of the book. I was fascinated reading what was going on and how Lena was involved. But I will say that this is the part of the story where the love-triangle begins and we meet Julian.<br /><br />Lena and Julian do have a very unlikely connection and I liked that a lot. I felt Julian was a wonderful character to add to this story; but, I have a difficult time with this particular relationship. Part of the enjoyment of Delirum was the honest, true love story between Lena and Alex. I feel that is a bit tainted now. This made me become irritated towards Lena during the end of this book and question her feelings. Plus, the cliffhanger didn't help. I like to have a book end during a good place where I can feel good about what I just read. I didn't really feel that way at the end of Pandemonium.<br /><br />Although I didn't like this sequel nearly as much as Delirium, Lauren's writing still continues to amaze me. Each new plot line or setting is beautifully crafted and it really transports the reader into the story.<br /><br />Recommended: Dystopian/Post-apocalyptic fans.

0684830485|4.0|I am not usually a literature guy (preferring non-fiction and popular novels), but I read this because it is a classic and I wanted to experience Hemingway beyond my high school reading of \\"The Old Man and the Sea.\\" (and honestly, because while dating my wife she revealed this as one of her favorite books and that aroused my curiosity.)<br /><br />This is a story that deals with the larger questions of life (and essential truths) and man's place in the world or at least in a challenging situation.  So that qualifies as literature according to my wife's definition when I asked her what made literature \\"literature\\" a while ago.<br /><br />Protagonist Robert Jordan is an American volunteering with the Republicans fighting Franco's Fascists in the Spanish Civil War.  A demolitions expert, Jordan's task is to blow a key bridge as part of a larger Republican attack.  While waiting with a small band of guerilla's he meets and falls in love with Maria, a victim of the war and symbol for all innocents caught in aggression's path.<br /><br />Thus we have a literary work that addresses commitment to cause, love, and the battle between individual wants and the needs of and obligations to a larger cause.<br /><br />Hemmingway has a way with description and his prose is very well done and evocative - particularly one passage I liked when he described holding Maria's hand with ripening grain in an untrammeled field.  His story is slow, however, for my tastes and the descriptions and inner conversations of Jordan are much more prevalent than scenes where anything called action could be said to be occurring (though the action scenes are pretty good when they do occur).  I imagine the ending will be unsatisfying to some, but for literary minded folks be the source of discussion as to how the final scene may have played out and what it meant in terms of tying the story's themes together.
014241543X|3.0|Review: Yes, it's true. I just read this book a few weeks ago. I had super high expectations about this book because it has terrific reviews. I gotta say, I wasn't blown away by it. Maybe my expectations were too high? I dunno.<br /><br />If I Stay introduces us to Mia. Mia is in a terrible car accident with her mother, father, and brother. One thing about this novel that grabbed me immediately was the strong bond Mia had with her family. Typically, in YA books, we may not get a great look at family relations. We only get a peak into the character's home-life and it may not be the best view. If I Stay paints a beautiful picture of a family. Mia's father and mother were loving and supportive. As Mia spends time in the hospital she remembers some of their times together.<br /><br />The idea behind this novel, as well as much of Gayle Forman's writing, was terrific. She has a way of describing a setting that really helps the reader grasp what is going on around the characters.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of flashbacks. Much of this book is series of flashbacks to Mia's memories of her parents and of Adam. Some people may enjoy this. It's just a personal preference but they make me feel really disconnected from what the \\"real\\" story is about. I don't mind learning about a character's past through their own thoughts, but this book just had too much of that.<br /><br />The other downside for me was Mia herself. She just wasn't what as emotional as I would have thought she should have been. And she seemed a bit..boring. At the end I just kept thinking \\"Why does Adam even love her so much?\\" I couldn't get a good handle on her personality besides just knowing what she loves music.<br /><br />Adam was the person who saved this book for me. He was interesting, caring, and passionate. Even though we really don't get to see him that much, he always managed to get my attention.<br /><br />The main character and all the flashbacks were what really brought this book down for me but, as mentioned, those are just personal preferences. The plot, writing, and events that occur during the actual story were exceptional. I just wanted more from Mia.<br /><br />Recommended: Contemporary fans or people who don't mind a story with a focus in the past and present.ut, as mentioned, those are just personal preferences.

I can't believe I waited so long to read it!<br /><br />The writing is beautiful, the story is touching, and I love how the book switches seamlessly from the present to the anecdotal past.

0525423281|4.0|Review: Lola and the Boy Next Door was such a fun read! It had a plot unlike any I've read, including having an eccentric girl and a nerdy boy -- which is something we rarely find in YA books. While I really enjoyed the book, I didn't like it as well as Anna and the French Kiss. I know most people have said they did, but it just didn't get to that level for me.<br /><br />In this book we meet Lola and get a glimpse into her non-traditional life. This part brings up one of the reasons why I love Stephanie's writing. She has the ability to jump out of the box and create characters that really work perfectly with the story.  Lola has 2 fathers, and they were outstanding!  They have a pretty big role in this book and they were the perfect parents for Lola. I could never imagine her with anyone else.<br /><br />Soon Lola realizes that her neighbors, Calliope and Cricket Bell, have moved back next door. When she sees them all she can remember is the painful past she had with the twins. She tries to ignore them but Cricket has a way of popping up everywhere. This is something she tries to accept but it brings a constant struggle with her older boyfriend Max.<br /><br />Lola Nolan was wonderful in so many ways. She was very different from the average teenage girl. That was something I absolutely loved about her character! She presented herself (through appearance) as something new each day. She wasn't afraid to take risks or be looked at strangely, she was simply unique. My only issue with Lola, and the only real issue with this book, was that I just couldn't connect with her as well as I would have hoped. Sometimes I just couldn't put together her feelings with her immediate actions.<br /><br />On the other hand, I adored Cricket in every way. He is just someone I'd want to go up to and pinch their cheeks! He was not someone you could really categorize in the typical sense. Sometimes in books we get either the \\"good guy\\" or \\"bad guy\\" vibe and immediately know how they will act, but I didn't see him as this. He was smart, cute, awkward, friendly -- and overall seemed much more real than many other male characters. I could really get a sense of how much he loved Lola.<br /><br />But it's not easy for Lola to forget the past and her boyfriend so she keeps Cricket at a bit of a distance. Max is the rocker-guy. He's 22, much older than Lola, and it's pretty easy to see from the start that they would never work out long-term. Max could be nice but would turn cruel in an instant.<br /><br />One of the best aspects of this book is that we get to see Anna and St. Clair again. St. Clair was hilarious and I really liked seeing what was going on with those 2 characters as well.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is a wonderful story of growing up, finding love, and finding your true identity. Stephanie does an amazing job incorporating important lessons into a cute love story.act, but I didn't see him as this.

0525422943|4.0|Review: Spoilers for book 1! I started reading this book right after I finished If I Stay. Although I wasn't crazy bout If I Stay, everyone I talked to said that Where She Went was much better. They were right!<br /><br />Where She Went is from Adam's point-of-view. It's 3 years after the accident and since Mia left for New York. Adam is a famous rock-star and Mia is a musician but they haven't spoken in years.<br /><br />Adam is shocked that Mia just left without a word since. Now he finds himself in New York getting ready for a tour and all the memories return. Sometimes it's difficult to find a story with a great male POV but this one has it. I really enjoyed Adam and hearing about his adventures. Even though he was far from a \\"good guy\\" he was much more likeable than Mia had been in If I Stay. I believed him more and he showed more emotion.<br /><br />Adam runs into Mia and they have 1 special night together. She takes him around New York to explore the city before they both go off on tour. Their relationship is strained at first. It takes a long time for Adam and Mia to reconnect. For obvious reasons, Adam is mad. He doesn't understand how someone he loved could leave like that. To make matters worse, Mia doesn't really acknowledge his pain or what she did to him.<br /><br />The setting and plot in Where She Went was much more interesting to me. We get a glimpse of New York and flashbacks of how Adam got to where he is now, but it wasn't too much. I was still able to stay connected with their present-day time together.<br /><br />Again, the only downside of this book was Mia. I was furious with her! She left, didn't say a word, then ignored the subject for most of the time they were together. I believed Adam loved her, but I honestly wasn't convinced she felt the same.<br /><br />Where She Went far surpassed If I Stay, in my opinion. Adam is a fantastic character and his POV truly allowed me to see his personality and his true essence.<br /><br />Recommended: I would recommend readers check out book 1, If I Stay first. It wouldn't be a must but it would help to understand what's going on. Readers who love contemporary or more emotional reads would enjoy this.would recommend readers check out book 1, If I Stay first.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is a great follow-up to The Hunger Games, giving you the continuation of the story you knew had to come after the ending of the first book.  In terms of the full trilogy, this is a fantastic middle book, giving you the action you want, the character development necessary for the remaining book and lots of twists you don't expect.  These books are very dark and full of pain and anguish which I think allows them to be enjoyed on a deeper level for both teens and adults.  I couldn't stop reading at the end of Catching Fire and immediately bought the final book to finish the series.
B000IOM0WE|4.0|I must confess that when I first saw the plot for this movie I was reminded of Woody Allen's \\"Sleeper\\"!  No, this is not a comedy.  But it does have a plot to eliminate the \\"Leader\\", so that society can be restored to its 'former glory' -- if we can say that as a truth.  Far more serious than what Mr. Angst had to say, it is nonetheless a very compelling movie...  Draws you in, so to speak.  Well the Blu-Ray price was captivating, so I put it on my Wish List, only to discover that I already had it!  I finally got around to putting my undocumented DVD's into my computer's library, and then discovered the duplication.  One should always make a list before shopping!
B004KSQN7C|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when this album droped.The lead single, Hold It Against Me, hooked me with the dubstep breakdown, because it was completely different in a Britney song,and I felt their was a good chance the rest of the album wouldn't match HIAM's aggressive yet sincere groove. I was wrong.<br /><br />The album opens with the second single, \\"Till The World Ends\\", which is perhaps the most energetic pure dance song Britney has ever created. Euphoric and pulsating, it trully takes you on a journey and comes to a satisfying climax full of \\"Oh oh's\\" The previously mentioned \\"Hold It Against Me\\" comes next, and does a great job maintining the dance floor. What comes next is one of my favorite tracks aside from the single releases, the mid-tempo breakup sex track \\"Inside Out\\". Their is such a yearning in her voice that draws you in and the beat drums continuosly with a taste of Hip Hop/R&B sounds coming together with electronic stuttering and dubstep elements. Very unique. \\"I Wanna Go\\", the third single, is up next. Next to the previously released tracks, Go sounds rather generic, but it is undeniably catchy and the whistle was brilliant. It won't be long before your shouting about wanting to \\"show all the dirt\\". How I Roll is up next. Another musically unique tune on the album. Fun, carefree pop, a bit of a rarity with her these days (but she is still the best at it)quit sexy and cheeky in some parts in the vain of \\"If U Seek Amy\\". Perhaps one of the most childish tracks, (Drop Dead) Beautiful is next. The lyrics aren't much but the chorus is once again, catchy enough the warrat repeated plays on radio if released. On a side not, Sabi doesan't offer anything a Lil Kim or Nicki Minaj couldn't deliver, so I question putting a mostly unknown rapper with such a big star. \\"Seal It With A Kiss\\" comes in next with a similar \\"ohhing\\" sound from the \\"Go\\" track. It's simple with some nice vocal work, but screams filler. The will.i.am collab \\"Big Fat Bass\\" now burstingand I cannot figure out why it is so disliked. The base pounds and Britney sounds robotic in the best sense as is will.i.am. A club stomper for sure.  \\"Trouble For Me\\" has a some sick club beats going on that have been used a lot lately with many DJ's and it woldn't be hard to see this played out in a club while trying to talk to that hot guy or girl (or both). \\"Trip To Your Heart\\" comes next. It's hard to believe that the producers on so many great Brit tracks, Bloodshy & Avant (Piece of Me, Toxic, Unusual U and the previous track How I Roll) also produced such a sweet 90's tasting dance tune. Not exactley a radio tune and could be considered filler, but it feels sincere on listen and provides a welcome break from the in-your-face dance tunes heard earlier. \\"Gasoline\\" takes it right back with sassy Britney comparing her love to a spark on gasoline and her lover setting her on fire. The standard closes with \\"Criminal\\" Opens very unexpectdly with a very folksy flute sound and then picking up. Perhaps the most pure sounding track on the standard, \\"Criminal\\" is aother unique Britney tune in its production and Brit delivers her vocals well while singing of being in love with someone she knows is bad for her but not really caring (at least not enough to leave)<br /><br />The bonus tracks on the deluxe edition are good, but not on par with the standard tracks and it's easy to see why they were left as extras (but if your a Brit fan, you'll likely dig them as much)\\"Up n Down\\" gets the party started again after the closing \\"Criminal\\". Interesting rythum here but reminiscent of \\"3\\", only not as fun. \\"He About to Lose Me\\" is by far the purest sounding Brit track on the album and anyone wanting to her her SING the way she did her oldes, will not want to miss this. Simple but the vocals do a good job caryying the weight while Brit sings about a lover who has stopped paying attention to her. \\"Selfish\\" comes in next and is my least favorite track here. The vocals sound flat as ifshe knew this wouldn't make the final 12 cut. It's fine as a bonus but was never single material or even main album filler. \\"Don't Keep Me Waiting\\" closes the deluxe with a rock/pop sound similar to \\"Roc Me In\\" from Circus, only not as fun. It does do a good job of ending the album with a feeling of wanting more and looking forward to her next collection. One last secret track for anyone buying the Japanese edition or the Premium Fan Edition will be trated to a 17th track and the only one with a writing credit towards Britney's name, \\"Scary\\". Incredibly uniqie in Brit catalogue and reminiscent of Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" track, but with the signature Brintey twist. By fat the best of the bonus tracks and even better than some of the standard 12. Brit must like it herself as it was sampled during the Femme Fatale Tour.<br /><br />All in all, I would say this is perhaps her strongest record musically as well as her most radio friendly. We may be missing Britney as a stage performer, but as a recording artist, she has never been better.

B006UREQ3Y|4.0|The band line-up for this concert recorded  July 27th 2011, at Victoria Hall, Stoke (England), was: Myles Kennedy - v; Slash - g; Bobby Schneck - g; Todd Kerns - b; Brent Fritz - d.<br /><br />The set list is amazing and well distributed. Slash is at peak form. Myles Kennedy is an amazing singer, but his vocals tone may annoy some people. After all, a lot of Guns & Roses songs were recorded by Axl at very high registers (no wonder Axl lost all his voice by now), and to sins G & R tunes is not easy.<br /><br />The back-up band is very competent and professional, as is the norm nowadays for top acts. Anything less than the highest proficiency will make the poor musician get replaced as fast as the blink of an eye.<br /><br />A very good DVD, you will not want to skip any song.

B007OUFESC|4.0|I think this film was rather kind to the splintered relationship of Freud and Jung. It was also kind about Freud's massive and mysogonistic ego he supposedly had in real life. Although, most male physicians at that time could be described as the same, so I suppose Siggy was not abnormal, he was just very famous and jewish and some older history books do not flatter him. He did earn his fame, but most of his notable first patients were females suffering from \\"hysteria.\\" Later on he was called out from those early cases as not proven \\"cured\\" because he didn't comply with the standard scientific technics by using several other variables, like placebos, to prove it was his technic that cured. It was also anti-semitism and intellectual jealousy that literally declared war within this new field during and after WWI. He had great fame as being the father of psychoanalysis during his lifetime and he used it for doing good. Freud contributed so much and so did Jung. Yet, Freud is still the contender. Viggo is a wonderful actor and I think he did something excellent here with his role as Freud. His quiet way of questioning, suggesting, active listening and his fatherly chuckles, especially the one he delivers while reading the scathing letter from Jung towards the end of the film. Knightly, held nothing back in her performance as Sabina Spielrein. A sexually frustrated hysteric that finds freedom and eventually her own fame as a child psychologist. Forced to strip naked as a young girl and through spankings and humiliation from her father, she developed sexually in a neurotic and repressive way that contradicted with church, society  and medicine at that time. She is a patient of Jung, and because of her high intelligence from a university education in medicine, is allowed to participate in some experiments. Vincent Casteel makes a brief, yet compelling performance as the unbalanced, psychoanalyst Otto Gross, needing treatment for himself. Otto is a referral patient from Freud sent to Jung for treatment by the demands of Otto's father. Jung tells him he heard he helped a patient commit suicide. Otto offhandedly responds that she was suicidal and he merely told her how to do it without botching it and gave her the option of becoming his lover. He follows up with a resigned \\"she opted for both.\\" Casteel plays this role of Otto, with such a beautiful contradiction of reckless indifference and human grace. He is wonderful in the scenes with Michael Fassbende, in shocking and baffling him with his philosophy, and explaining Freud's theory of transference between physcian and patient in a wicked way. He looked like lucifer sitting outside in that garden enjoying his cigarette, with that slight grin on his face, and taking control over the conversation between himself and Jung. I loved him! Casteel could have played the part of a shorter  Jung, but we would have missed him as that poor, deranged physician and his shenanigans. Jung starts to give in to the transference and experiments with Spielrein, that crosses boundaries. When news leaks out about Jung's affair with her, he breaks it off and asks Freud to help soften the blow by writing to her. This brings about some dramatic moments between Jung and Spielrein where Spielrein wields some power to get justice or payback, however you want to see it. Both come out with gain at the end of the film, but in real life, Spielrein was later murdered by Nazis back in Russia during WWII and Jung lived a long, full life.<br />This intervention from Freud eventually leads to her working for him and becoming a child psychologist. Freud's refusal to give any credence to Jung's theories into mysticism is the wedge that breaks their working relationship apart. Fassbende is excellent with Knightly as he restrains and gives tension from himself at the right moments that brighten Knightly's performance...he does this really well with all of the actors. I love his sober restraint when Knightly is helping him onan experiment with the actress Sarah Godon playing his wife. His coldness allowed Godon's subtle awkwardness feel more intense, without Godon having to over due it. The scene with Viggo in Freud's study, when wood is snapping from the bookcases and  Fassbende is in a lather, telling Viggo he knew it would happen and predicted the second one snapping, and goes on about mysticism all agitated, while Viggo's reaction is fatherly as he scoffs at it. Viggo is a tad condicending to him, but not cruel in his reaction. Yes, this film plays with history, but I haven't seen a feature film about historical figures be any where in the ballpark when it comes to accuracy.This is a good one if you've ever had to study a little bit of Freud and Jung a long time ago, and don't mind a little salt in your sugar.

That's why slavery lasted as long as it did.  Abolitionists were referred to as heathens and infidels by the Christian church.  It was the liberal North that pushed for the end of slavery and the Christian South that opposed it.<br />This movie is nothing but vomit-worthy self glorification of Christians.<br />Is there anything you guys won't lie about?

1619492911|3.0|This is a much stronger, more cohesive novel than Fitzgerald's first outing in This Side of Paradise. I enjoy his use of multiple formats and headers. Really, there's not much to be faulted with in the story telling, save perhaps an overwrought ending. But, on a personal level, I have to admit I find it all so depressing. It's a dreary story of lost, lonely, and purposeless people, who, we know from the beginning, will never find redemption for themselves or their doomed relationships.

B0067LY4WG|5.0|I bought this album recently and am completely hooked. I've been listening to it over and over again. I pretty much grew up with his music over the years and have seen his voice change, but the quality of poetry never does. I guess that is one aspect that has ruled supreme since his emergence from McGill university  years ago. This is not just good songwriting, but complex poetry and emotions put forward simply through haunting melodies. Thank God for the liner notes with this CD as the words resonate crystal clear. It is whispered in your ear with melody and sometimes ...just a word whisper, slowly softly. Lenny Cohen is always reflective and self critical, even when he is commenting on society in general, and this one comes out right on top. Love it. I hope here is a message in this for record companies that have pushed an excessive amount of (c)rap with bad poetry, hip hop with uncontrolled angst and low level pop for mass consumption. After many years and decades of suffering (and perhaps led by You Tube revival), good melody, good poetry and just mature creation by the Masters is back. Thank God for 'old ideas'.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it reminds me of computer class in elementary school I love it cant wait to get farther along wonder what will happen
B0055SWM08|5.0|Excellent game for improving your thinking &amp; addictive!  Can play while waiting in line or for as long as you like.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is most challenging and soothing. Great job Dev!  Confucius say...........man standing on toilet, high on pot. Also, man who go fishing in other man's pond, catch crabs.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|this app is all you need it to be.  I love how it reminds you of bills due even if you are using your kindle in another mode.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I think this is a cool game. I loved the original as a kid so its fun to play it again.  I love that some parts are the same.  however. I wish there was a faster way to gain energy, without spending real money, you do have to do a lot of waiting.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|its a fun game allows you come back later instead of sit in front of it unless u choose too. only thing I don't like is when you level up they say you got a new food that wasn't on the menu but when you check its not there
B006903GX8|5.0|I watched the PBS Series and loved it.  This book is true to the series and allows me to read about Downton Abbey when I cannot be watching the series.  The characters are very interesting and the class differences are unbelievable.  I especially liked the story of Bates and Anna.  It is a true love story about true love.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|This is a great movie, giving an intimate and poignant look into the life of Margaret Thatcher. The movie is not for everyone especially for those wanting to avoid glimpses into diseases of the elderly such as Alzheimer's, Dementia and Schizophrenia.<br /><br />The Iron Lady covers touches so many aspects of life. It especially takes a look at the struggle of a strong and courageous woman in a \\"men\\"s world.\\" Unlike many movies about public figures, it starts from Thatchers elder years with her flashbacks of her interesting life and leadership.<br /><br />Meryl Streep well-deserved an academy award for her outstanding performance at Thatcher.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple game with solid graphics. The premise of it is simple yet you want to get it perfect every time and catch all the spheres with your drop.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like this game my friend plays it also.  keeps me busy. must try this game. needs more energy to play
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Some have been critical of the video quality of this DVD - I get their point - It was not shot on film, so couldn't really be converted to HD quality in post. That said, our old VHS copy went south.. and this is a fine replacement. The concert is amazing.. and the added materials are great..
B004LP3AYI|1.0|I read a review that the e-version had been corrected and purchased this book yesterday, April 11, 2012.  The title page just repeated ad nauseum.  I deleted and downloaded several times without any improvement.  Finally, returned the book for refund.  I like the author and enjoyed Wizard's First Rule.  Quality is becoming a major issue for me with downloads.  Received my Kindle Fire for Christmas and did not anticipate the number of book problems I have experienced.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Cool games but have to play for a while and earn points.<br />It gets harder as you play longer. lots of fun
B004FOA84A|3.0|The wooden birds are positioned like the drawing in one of the rooms. After you open the secret door with the fuse, you have to go back and close it again. You will then see a poster on the other side of the door and the word LOVE goes with the puzzle on the globe. Look on the fridge and check what colors the letters are. When you receive a wooden box you have to throw it in the fire and then throw the fish bowl water on it. I hope this helps some of you that are stuck and want help.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I like this game. Pretty well balanced for a puzzle game. Graphics are good and it runs very smoothly.<br /><br />Evo 4g
B005TMSN4E|5.0|I have read the reviews of the FT-1 adapter before purchasing it, so I had no unrealistic expectations of it. This adapter allows me to use all my AF-S lenses on the Nikon V1. Of course one has to factor in the 2.7x field of view crop, the lack of continuous autofocus and only having a center focus point, plus whatever shortcomings the Nikon V1 had. However, it's fun concentrating 10 megapixels on to a smaller field of view - my Nikon 70-200, if coupled with a 1.4x teleconverter, is now a 260-750 mm f2.8 lens, and the AF-S and VR both work! WIthout the mirror slap, too, and with video! My neck and wallet are both thankful for not having to carry a 300mm f2.8 with a DSLR to capture little birds (at least for my non-published uses).
B0055SWM08|4.0|excellent game great for passing the time.  the puzzles are definitely tricky but not so tough you cant figure them out....and that keeps you coming back
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Comparable to Mario. Not as good of course,  but not bad. Liked it. It was pretty addicting actually.  Download it!  Yay!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This is a great little Mario type game but I hate how close the buttons are so close together other than that every thing is amazing like shooting pinecone!
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is a great weather ap. very accurate.<br />love it! recommend this to all. never any problems with this at all.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great great book.  You will be turning the pages well into the night.  Very well written and suspenseful.  Will keep you guessing right up to the end.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The background music alone makes it worthwhile. One of the most fun puzzle games ever played on the Android. thanks fallen tree
B0055SWM08|5.0|I think this is a great game for all ages! Exercises the brain and keeps you entertained. I recommend this game for anyone that wants a fun way to pass the time.
034547581X|5.0|This is one of the most vivid accounts of the war in Vietnam I have read. The young men who fought there were the true heroes of their generation. It gives new meaning to the phrase \\"War is hell.\\"
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|energy. you play for five minutes, then wait for a half hour for your energy to restore. its a good game, but if gameloft could do something diffrent with the energy, i'd give it 5 stars for sure.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love the relaxing music and the simple (yet challenging) puzzles. I don't always like games,  but this one is enjoyable. If you're looking for an exciting or fast-paced game,  this isn't it. But it's just the right speed for me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very well written.  I connected with the characters and enjoyed the story.  Go Katniss.  Going to get the other books in the series.
0060763892|5.0|\\"The Judas Strain\\" was published in 2007, so I'm clearly late to the party, but I'm so glad I came! If you haven't read this book yet, buckle up your seatbelts and get ready for an amazing thrill ride! I whooped and hollered through this book, totally immersed in the continent- and time-jumping Indiana Jones-esque action, rooting for the good guys, booing the bad ones, hoping for Good to triumph over Evil, and trying (vainly) to guess the ending. Let's just say, I loved this book! Great writing, action-packed adventure, likeable characters, interesting science tidbits...the whole package is a big win. Can't wait to jump into another Sigma Force book!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this game! While some combinations are intuitive, others are not and are sometimes quite humorous.  I also liked the mini game bonuses, I especially thought that Run, Santa, Run was really  funny.<br /><br />As for replaying, I'm not sure yet since I haven't finished Sins vs. Virtues yet so I haven't reset my elements yet.<br /><br />The animations are solid, game play is engaging, the solutions are very clever in some cases but my favorite part is the quotes you get when you create a new element.<br /><br />While some quotes are from tried and true quotable masters, some are from ... unusual sources.  I found most of them laugh out loud hilarious.
B006ON41FC|1.0|Mediocre game - I thought it would be a fun game for the kids and made the mistake of trusting the ratings.  Amazon should flag these apps to ensure they do not get our purchases based on false ratings as it degrades the integrity of their marketplace.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love the concepts. Some might say to close to Mario,  but there are differences that make the game fun and different. I really enjoy playing!! ^_^
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|This is Charlie at his best. I laughed so hard at the factory eating machine scene I thought I was going to have a heart attack. This is a must see for anyone who loves the movies. It is a timeless classic and its humanity rings as true today as when it was first made back in the Great Depression.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series is great! This is the first book. I loved the story and the characters. I would recommend it to others.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game has a lot to offer no matter what kind of game you like. if only it gave a better description for each game.
B0073O0AME|3.0|The music was fun to listen to, however between each song was a long and ambiguous narrative. The narrative made it impossible to use the music as background music as it seem to constantly be interrupting the spirit and flow of the songs.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|its a cool game like Mario witch is nice if you like push button jump games gets Mindanao boring but its fun if you keep playing but lets be honest I'm only blabiring on to fill the word quota but its a nest game
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a fabulous game.  relaxing and absorbing at the same time.  very zen, due in part to the nice music.  A keeper!
B00181YT9S|5.0|These are hooked up to my TV with the optical digital connection -- they fit nicely on the shelf and improve the (Panasonic) TV's sound 100%, especially when playing DVDs.  Good deal for $100...
B007R41E8O|4.0|Took. a while. to load but I like. the way the game plays. Well worth the dollar Interesting. game concept. Keep them. coming. guy's I love. these types of games Only. reason not five stars was loading issue
B0055SWM08|5.0|The music, game play, and difficulty fit very well together to make an excellent game. I've played this on iOS since it is free with no ads, and was very excited to get this on Android. I have purchased Quell Reflect because these are both very well made. I have been recommending this game to many friends in the past year or so, and will continue to recommend it!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|i ADORE THIS ENTIRE SHOW and everything about it! count me IN on any further seasons/episodes.... i may have to move to the UK just to show my loyalty to their fantastic ability to produce QUALITY tv entertainment.... (and a few other reasons! LOL)<br />for my FULL \\"opinion\\" read my review of season one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|use it all the time. very very helpful to be able to access from anywhere all the time. nice to have my info backed up
630469878X|5.0|There are times when you get the urge to watch a good, I've done something bad, running from the law, only because I was forced into it movie.  Thelma & Louise satisfies that urge nicely.  The acting is good throughout. It's one of those situations that even though you know it's fictional, you could see how it could very well happen in real life.  It's entertaining from start to finish.  Good movie.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The premise of the game is simple. The music is beautiful and you can get lost in it. The levels become more challenging as you go but not annoyingly so. If I need to relax and need a few minutes to myself this is the perfect game.
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of Oliver Stone's finest movies.  There is not a moment throughout the entire movie that you are not captivated with the story.  Excellent picture.
1594484813|4.0|When I finished reading the last page and closed the book, the first words out of my mouth were, \\"Yowsa, that was a darn fun read.\\"<br /><br />Delving into the world of rare and collectible books, Allison Hoover Barlett outlines what it means to truly love books and what can happen when that love crosses over to the dark side, as in the case of John Gilkey, as well as the impact it has on the victims.<br /><br />Although the story features Ken Sanders, book collector/dealer turned psuedo-detective (aka \\"The Bibliodick\\"), and John Gilkey, the man who loved books so much he stole, lied, and conned to get them, the primary character was Bartlett herself.<br /><br />I've seen and read enough true crime to understand the difference between dramatizing/reporting criminal events and the transforming of those events into a memoir. Though this book comes across as true crime, it would probably be more accurately classified as a memoir of writing an article about book collecting which morphed into a memoir about writing this book. This book is neither a dramatization nor a report--it stopped being either when Barlett injected her own personal experiences; it was no longer unbiased.<br /><br />Bartlett takes readers on the journey with her as she first meets Gilkey, drenching us with her emotions, and when she accompanied Gilkey to the scene of one of his thefts, and as she struggled with her conscience when Gilkey personally shared incriminating evidence with her.<br /><br />Through her we get to learn about the rare book trade and feel the exhilaration of attending a book fair. And also through her, we can see the faces behind those beautiful rare book stores, the deluded depravity of Gilkey, who stole hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of books from California to New York, and the tenacity of Ken Sanders who tries as hard as he can to protect himself and others from Gilkey and those like him.<br /><br />While this is a fun read, it might not appeal to the die-hard true crime readers because of its bias and memoir style, but as long as one doesn't go in with specific journalistic expectations, it should be an enjoyable--and quick--read. I couldn't put it down once I started.crime readers because of its bias and memoir style, but as long as one doesn't go in with specific journalistic expectations, it should be an enjoyable--and quick--read.

B0041KKYDI|2.0|you know the story so no \\"review\\" needed, but as for my opinion of the flick...cheese wad, hollywood-assed, red bull/mountain dew drinking, celluloid swill.  let me start with the fact i do all these kind of adventures, even lived outta my truck, but please....no one pops wheelies and bunnyhops on their mountain bike down a flat dirt road with an adventure pack on a 20 mile approach, the cheesy actress chicks had on so much make up and looked so \\"i buy my gear at rei, full retail price\\" it made my middle finger twitch...horse hockey, no one even had sweat rings in the heat of the day, as for the rock falling on his hand...what do you expect when you dont test the rock you are about to fully weight. if this film actually did portray the star as he really was, then he was a complete tool.  im sure all the 4 and 5 stars came from city-slicking, north face wearing, treadmill running, tv worshipping gapers....so, in retrospect, this film was quality hollywoood sewage, with a popular appeal to all the milktoasts who dont actually have the balls to have an adventure themselves, and just dont know the difference between reality and reality tv.
B006IGZX0C|4.0|This movie is fascinating and a powerful look at our mid-20th century culture.  Seeing the events unfold tells us much about the world we've inheirited.  As one who grew up in the western United States, but moved as an adult to the South, I learned so much about racial relationships from watching this.  I also get an education into the nature of southern women and how they are formed and (sometimes mal-formed).
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Never owning a headphone amp in my life, I thought I'd give it a chance since buying the new Audio Technica ATH-M50 headphones. I charged it, plugged all the cables in and the sound is definitely improved. Not that the Audio Technica ATH-M50 sound prior to the headphone amp is anything but crisp and spacious with pretty good bass, but this definitely gives it MORE. More of everything - highs, miss, lows, depth and it sounds really full. 5 stars.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Invalid or not, I can see that it comes to each of us when we realize how little we can interpret the puddle that is... &quot;paranoia&quot; ~ nobody. (It stretches to the fullest potential for the third party stakeholders)
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is the best and most awesome game In the appstore. I play it all the time because it is very addicting. the best part its FREE. My suggestion GET THIS APP.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Lots of fun! Mindless entertainment that I play while my granddaughter watches her favorite movies. I would recommend this app for fun.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I gave it the exact zip code of the town I live in and it rarely has the correct weather, the temperatures are from hours previous and it is currently raining outside but the app says its cloudy I uninstalled, don't waste your time
0345803485|1.0|I had heard so much about this book that I had to have it.  So when one of my close friends bought and read it in like 3 days, I told myself, now I have to read this.  OMG I wish I would have saved myself the money.  This was not a page turner for me.  I took 3 day breaks from it and I am only on ch. 12.<br /><br />As I read the book I kept seeing Pretty Woman in the story.  It was a lot like Richard Gere wanting Julia Roberts at his \\"beck and call\\".<br /><br />The contract was waaaaayyyy to long for me to even bother to read, and the sex part I just didn't get.  This girl is supposed to be a virgin and she is giving excellent jobs.  I don't know.<br /><br />I didn't find anything in this book anywhere near any of my fantasies.  Who would want a man to treat them like they were just purchased.<br /><br />I really wanted to like it because I bout it on ebooks and this sad book won't even serve the purpose of a coaster.<br /><br />Oh well.
B0055SWM08|5.0|different in concept and gameplay from the usual.  quite good.  highly recommend this for anyone who prefers to think about puzzles and solutions.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|An addicting pleasure. Can't get enough. If there is one game I could recommend this is it. If you are looking for something to challenge your mind you need to try this.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I bought this trilogy after falling in love with the commercials for the movie. I expected something different, but was still blown away by Stieg Larsson's characterization of Lisbeth Salander.Although she had very corrupt people in her life, she was anything but a victim as even in the face of adversity, she came out on top. I have yet to see the movie and now I feel that if I see the movie it will not be anything like the experience I got from reading these books. I highly recommend this. I have never been into female heroes but Lisbeth Salander is a force to be reckoned with.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|if you are easily offended, you will NOT like this. but if you have a good sense of humor and can laugh at male chauvinistic jokes, you will love this band. they are great live too
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. I watched the movie first then decided there had to be more. So I read the book now I am hooked. I am currently reading the second book.
B007RFJ4QM|2.0|All performances are phoned in. The cast is good, but everything about the script and direction is derivative and bland. This is a textbook example of a rehashed, unmemorable film. You've seen everything in it five times already. Imagine a TV heist drama. Now imagine another TV heist drama that uses the first as a model. That's what you have.<br /><br />Also, the evil character's motivations are very obscure. It's never really clear why anybody does anything. This movie makes a Statham movie look like Blade Runner.
B0055SWM08|5.0|well designed, smooth action, I have played about 12 levels of 4 puzzles and have not ran into a bug or glitch, the puzzles build on what you have learned in earlier games and new things are introduced. An easy game to get the hang of but the challanges keep it interesting
B0050BPIB0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Pablo's music. When I bought this CD, I listened to it all day long. I can feel a lot of love coming through his music and voice. All of his songs are full of passion, love and beauty. I went from Paris to Madrid last December to attend on his concert. Oh my God, he had an incredible voice. And I loved, loved that he could smile! It's so important. I'm looking forward to buying his new CD, hopefully he will release it very soon.
B005PW3OS8|1.0|I slept through the last half hour of the movie. It was so bad that I let the rent time expired instead of wasting time to keep watching it.
1609611543|5.0|Well worth reading and has lots of information about planting, growing, harvesting, and the processing of wheat and all the changes it undergoes until its no longer the natural product it should be.  Will change your mind about the food you purchase and eat daily,  Highly recommend.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I have a condition that makes me very forgetful do having an app like this helps me remember vital information on this days where there are so many passwords and usernames to remember. Thanks developers for this app!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My grand daughter lives in USA so real easter eggs can be a problem from this side of the pond.  She is very pleased with the DVD instead.  Good service, would use this again.  Easy to track, which is also a boon.
B004I744AS|5.0|Besides being a fantastic dictionary there are daily word games, quotes, birthdays etc. I usually go to this app everyday.
030726999X|5.0|Hardcover/Thriller:  Okay, so I made this my break book for work so I could read it slowly.  After all, it is the last book for Larsson, ever (unless the rumors are true).  That lasted until about halfway through the book because I then spent two late nights reading the second half of the book.<br />This book starts about 40 minutes where the last book left off.  Lisbeth is in dire straights and Blomkvist must protect her.  The plot revealed in book 2 is a major plot line to this story.  There are a few sub-stories that keep the pages turning.  I started to get worried at the end because I wanted to see everything wrapped up because there are no more books.<br />I am so team Lisbeth.  This whole series is exceptional.  Yes, Lisbeth spends most of her time in a hospital bed in this book, but it is what she does there to free herself that is entertaining.  Blomkvist is still a 'ho and Berger has new job blues.<br />Side note: I called my work roommate at home today to tell her that I had finished and we could now talk about it.  She's on medical leave and couldn't talk too much.  She had already finished the series and thanked me for introducing her to the series.  She in turn, has two others hooked on it.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I love Daria and am sooooo happy its finally available on DVD. The only thing is that they couldnt keep all the music because of licensing issues.  And it does tug at my heart strings a bit because the music was a big part of my youth. That being said, it doesnt take away from the show at all and now i am giggling my way through it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fantastic game!  It reminds me of one of my old favorites, Heaven and Earth... simple yet elegant, and challenging but not frustratingly so.
B005KMX866|4.0|I've listened to Chris Isaak for a couple decades.  His voice is timeless.  These covers are all good listens.  If you liked the originals by the original artists, you'll enjoy Isaak's renditions, too.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I don't know what it is, but there is something special about this movie. I enjoyed every bit of this movie. There is plenty of action, humor, and heartfelt moments between characters. \\"Real Steel\\" is a must see film, and it will have you on your feet cheering at the end. A beautiful story.
B005HV6Y5W|3.0|Not a great movie, not a bad movie...Some will like it and some wont.....<br /><br />I wont even bother reviewing the movie since so many have...I'll just say :<br /><br />good grief people. CHILL......<br /><br />1st, people are entitled to their opinion. Some may like a movie while others dont...Thats life..Different strokes for different folks.<br /><br />What is ridiculous imo, is all you people who loved this film are ragging hard/insulting/degrading those who didnt like it.<br /><br />Why not take a look at the number of reviews and see that there are about as many 1 star reviews as there are 5 star reviews (and lots of each) which makes it obvious this is one of those unique films some will LOVE and others will HATE.<br /><br />And whats wrong with that? NOTHING!<br /><br />The world is being flushed down the toilet and you folks have nothing better to do then rag/insult/degrade people who didnt like a movie and vice versa?<br /><br />Get a grip people...if you only knew how people perceive you after leaving such nutty comments....well, I'll just end this by saying you all look like spoiled immature clowns who think you sit on a pedestal looking down at others you perecive to be not as good as you.<br /><br />Sorry, but many of you just seem like pathetic know it alls with no life whatsoever.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|it was fun until it wont let me visit friends and now all the crops. stores. and animals reset. so now I cant get food or make money. looked it up and has been an issue since atleast November. and they still have not fixed any of the problems. would have been a five but now I cant do 1 thing. so it is worthless.
B002APU580|5.0|I and my daughters absolutely love this movie.  We were very very excited to see that it was available for purchase and were equally excited to watch it!

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|luv this game. my seven year old can't. get enough he would play for hours at a time if we let him.great price
B003R2GGYM|4.0|Amazon in France selling this considerably cheaper, even with shipping charge to the U.S..  Also, somebody posted that the UK version has English subtitles for the extras, unlike the French version.  But the UK version is locked into region B.  I bought a gizmo that supposedly will let my Oppo play A-B-C blu-rays, but haven't had the nerve to install it yet.  This whole web of catches and traps is an insult to serious movie lovers who willingly pay for these discs.  They love to make us sit through that stupid statement in French and English on every DVD on how in Switzerland or some such place Interpol or some such group will have a case of the vapours if we so much as show the (purchased) DVD in a church basement to a group.  How about reciprocating by unlocking these items?  OK, I'm done -- for now.
B005VOOQMS|5.0|I am not even kidding when I say that this is the best book I have ever read. I couldn't put the book down and because of this I finished it in three days. I loved the book the author and the series. Go Eragon and Saphira. I hope that there will be a sequal series to and if it comes out I will be sure to read it because I love the book so much.
0062060562|1.0|I love suspense.  The early reviews of this book were very promising.  Unfortunately, this book (for me) did not deliver any thrills, nor suspense.  Dennis Lehane must have been paid handsomely for his pithy comment!  The \\"Groundhog Day\\" style unfolds at a snail-like pace and doesn't build to crescendo, but lands with a thump.  Most readers, I'm sure, can figure out the \\"thriller ending,\\" and the last few pages tie it up neatly with a bow.  Sorry, but the journey is not worth the destination.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Clever game play, beautiful music, lovely graphics, this is a truly enchanting game! Very relaxing, very zen, HIGHLY recommended! Absolutely love it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love playing quell. Its so much fun and I am really impressed with the graphics. Although it would be nice if there was an option to chwnge the theme. But I still love the game!
0099579936|5.0|I kept hearing everyone talk about the book Fifty Shades of Grey, so when I needed a good book to read I downloaded it onto my Kindle.  I must say by the second Chapter I was like holy rollers this book is pure erotica...  But I cannot say I have not enjoyed reading every page of it...  I'm now on the second book in the triology and I find myself not being able to put down my kindle.  The author has written this story so well that I find it a very easy read, even though every other page is the main characters having sex and more sex.  I told the ladies on my vanpool who happened to be the one's talking about it, if they knew what the book was about & they said \\"no\\" they just keep on getting told they should read it.  So of course I had to share what it is all about, but I assured them that the book is a very easy read, but also cautioned them that they should probably have a fan blowing directly on them and be in their underclothes because it makes you have hot flashes like no menopause can ever make you have.  But I must say I truly love the books and the story that comes out in them.

B00756GKBA|3.0|I bought the Explicit version of this CD....Ho-hum....Not much to it. I'm a HUGE Madonna fan. I have enjoyed following her career since American Bandstand and her debut way back when.....This CD has a lot great Sounds....Yet<br />she's done a lot of it before. You can hear some \\"Vogue\\" here....and she borrows a little from Garbage \\"Bang-Bang\\"....the production on this CD is Decent. I think however....some of the songs are Dumb. I enjoy Madonna. She is still Beautiful, and she still can Move! She showed that. My complaint about the music on this CD is that it doesn't break new ground. Madonna is ofen Very Edgy....in the past she has been a trend setter...and everything she does is risky and on the fringe. This CD is disappointing. There is nothing New here. Nothing Risky...and a lot of reminders of past efforts...like Vogue and Hard Candy....If you like her, the CD is worth a listen. There are songs that are \\"hooky\\". Much of it makles you long for what Might have Been.<br /><br />Atreides

B002ZG97LK|1.0|I'm not sure why I decided to see this.  I have not seen the original (avoid the Bacon at all costs) yet somehow this remake wound up on my Netflix queue and before I could stop it, they were shipping it to my house.  My wife was excited.  She loves dancing.  I do too, but there was something about this that seemed so `wrong' to me; so much so that I was heavily opposed to us watching it.<br /><br />We watched it.<br /><br />There is so much wrong with `Footloose' that I'm not even sure where to begin.  The basic premise is that a town, stricken with tragedy, goes overboard in an attempt to preserve the lives of their youth and actually bans public dancing unless supervised and orchestrated by adults (like a school dance observed by the Minister who enforces a rule that forbids dancing closer than six inches apart).  The Minister's young and tramplike daughter rebels, dates an older guy and dances in the parking lot of a local diner when the police aren't patrolling.  An outsider with a heart of gold comes to town, is picked on by locals, given a bad wrap and eventually falls for the Minister's daughter and together they fight for their right to dance.<br /><br />Seriously.<br /><br />The fact that nothing in `Footloose' makes sense ultimately becomes the film's biggest downfall.  I mean, it's enough that the town bans dancing, which is somewhat ludicrous, but the way the dance scenes are staged are ridiculous (the music blaring at a popular diner in a small town and thought to be unnoticeable when a cop literally pulled out of the parking lot not thirty seconds before the owner popped in the CD) and the music selected, while paying homage to the original film, also made no sense.  I'm sorry, but the song `Footloose' just isn't cool anymore, no matter who is singing it.  The acting is horrendous and the plotting is filled to the brim with holes that are puttied over with obvious clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />Yes, Dennis Quaid sells his speeches, but outside of that the film is a bit `WTF'.<br /><br />I also found it quite humorous that Andie MacDowell gives some \\"I've been silent\\" speech towards the end and I was thinking to myself, `I totally forgot you were in this'...i.e.; she was right.  Kenny Wormald can't act, but he can dance; although I must say that this film tries far too hard to emulate the latest trend in `Step Up' films and fails rather drastically because the integration of country music into this breed of film doesn't come off as `inspired' as they wanted it to.  The dancing numbers become repetitive and lack any real charisma (all fake, plastic, manufactured).  Mile Teller is kind of hilarious and deserves props for having to spit out some of the most ridiculously clich&eacute;d and stereotypical jargon I've heard in a feature film lately.  After watching him devastate in 2010's `Rabbit Hole', I was hoping he'd get a big break.  Maybe this was it.  Maybe now he can move on to more fare similar to `Rabbit Hole'.<br /><br />Oh, and Wormald's dance freakout in the mill is completely OTT and utterly hilarious; which was not the intent.is a bit `WTF'.<br /><br />I also found it quite humorous that Andie MacDowell gives some \\"I've been silent\\" speech towards the end and I was thinking to myself, `I totally forgot you were in this'...i.e.; she was right.

B004UXUX4Q|1.0|George Clooney.  I'll never understand the appeal.  I take that back.  I get it, to a degree, and I even buy into it, to a degree.  I just feel that the world, much like with Johnny Depp, is too late to this party.  I mean, back in the 90's, Depp was amazing.  When does the world take notice?  When he stars in that Disney `pirate' movie.  Back in the early aughts, Clooney was starring in quality films with varying subjects and smart directors who knew how to use him.  When does the world embrace him?  When he gets obnoxiously political and starts starring in a slew of pretentious films pretending to be smart.<br /><br />And I thought `Up in the Air' was bad.<br /><br />`The Descendants', as expected, was high on Oscar's radar.  They love Clooney now.  Sadly, this film is a complete misstep in that it just appears so surface; so miniscule.  It is trying to say so much about family and heritage and the preservation of both (literally and then again figuratively portrayed by the Hawaiian landscape).  Instead of getting into the heart of it though, `The Descendants' throws a slew of unlikable characters at us and expects us to weed through their flaws to find ourselves.  I've never in my life wanted to hit so many people.  Sadly, Alexander Payne forgot how to make movies.  I mean, `Sideways' and `About Schmidt', while not perfect, were really well done films  that haunted in certain ways.  With this film, Payne merely resorts to layering his ill-conceived drama with a bunch of poorly executed `monologues' that are supposed to amount to something in the end but wind up amounting to a lot of hot air.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Matt King, a lawyer who is trustee to a lot of beautiful land his family left to him and his cousins.  His cousins (or at least most of them) want to sell the land and make a fortune.  Matt is old school and believes in working for his money and so he deprives his family of an overtly rich life.  He has lost touch with his wife, who has been having an affair behind his back and planned on leaving him.  His eldest daughter is wayward and his youngest daughter is confused.  Oh, and his wife was in a severe accident and is on life support.  This obiovusly makes him reflect on his life and go soul searching (sort of) and blah blah blah.<br /><br />Shailene Woodley is rather excellent here, but the rest of the cast is so uneven.  Clooney is wooden and somewhat phones this in.  Amara Miller is annoying.  I wanted to run Nick Krause over with my car (seriously, a film trying to be this poignant should not resort to such depths of stereotypical clich&eacute;s).  What is Matthew Lillard doing in this movie?  Judy Greer seemed promising and then she had that ridiculous outburst in the hospital that made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />UGH, and this won an Oscar!  Seriously, the script is really skeletal and needed so much more fleshing out to make it feel well rounded.  Instead, this just became so faux important.  I hate that Clooney picks these films that attempt to be taken seriously but say so little about the subject they are pretending to know so much about.<br /><br />And if you have to basically read us the book through voice over narration during the film's opening ten minutes just to get us on track with the film then maybe you should rethink your scripting approach.been having an affair behind his back and planned on leaving him.

0439023521|5.0|Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be ever in your favor.Hunger Games is a book that will turn the pages for you. It all started when sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen finds herself in the Hunger Games Arena, fighting to her own death. When Katniss figures out that the other tribute from District 12, (Peeta Mellark) has had a crush on her forever. She then realizes that one of them will die, if not both.<br />  If I had to rate this book as a 1-10, I would give it an eleven. The author, (Suzanne Collins) did an awesome job of keeping the readers interested. Next time you go to the bookstore, get \\"The Hunger Games\\"
B007MJSYF0|4.0|I liked this film but I would rather read the book which I haven't as yet so I can understand the nuances which are usually missing in a film.  I do no know one thing for sure and its that Collins did indeed lift much of her HG story from Battle Royale.<br /><br />Its bloody, its sad.  There is some social commentary but very little explanation of what kind of world produced the student games. The acting is good but the script didn't really lead to too much character development except for a few characters such as the student who was strong yet socially isolated, hurt from years of childhood abuse and neglect.  Its worth renting but I wouldn't buy the dvd.  I would rather invest in the book.
0345803485|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is completely out of the box from something I would normally pick up. It was fresh, well-written and totally sexy. Of course, it is for adult eyes only but I was pleasantly surprised to become engrossed in the actual story and learn something about the BDSM community. The characters are not run of the mill, they have depth, back stories and a ton of personality that seems to jump off the page. Fifty Shades is a page turner to say the least!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is another fine offering from Sherwood Pictures! The movie covers crises of faith by different characters -- loss of employment, loss of a child, loss of one's moral character -- and shows how God will get you through it if you will only trust Him to do so. In tandem with these crises, the characters also find strength in building up one another's faith and trust, becoming each other's support system in the process. This is a great movie for families with teens. I do not recommend it for younger children simply because some of the plot has very sad moments (such as the child's death), and some scary moments (such as the gang members engaging in a gun fight with cops, and the attempted kidnapping of a little girl). Other than that, grab the popcorn, and station a box of tissues nearby when you watch this film. (Even my hubby shed a few tears!).[[ASIN:1466365781 Common Truth: Answers to Difficult Bible Topics]]
1410430103|5.0|Only my second Reacher novel, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The plot is intriguing, the pace is great and so is the action/suspense.  It is a real page turner. (If you don't like a lot of gore though, this book is not for you.)<br /><br />My best takeaway from this book was the discussion near the end on the distribution and printing of money which was both interesting and informative.<br /><br />My primary complaint after two Reacher novels is that the author is rather sloppy in his research.  One of the lead \\"Killing Floor\\" reviewers points out that the murder at the Atlanta airport makes no sense.  Another reviewer notes that the play on \\"E Pluribus Unum\\" is incorrect Latin grammar. A particularly annoying issue to me is that the author does not research his locations very well.  Even though Margrave is fictional, Georgia is not. The travels around the Margrave/Atlanta area do not make good geographical sense.  Nor do his descriptions of the Atlanta airport.  Finally, I did not understand the urgency of getting everything done by \\"Sunday morning\\"--the Coast Guard blockade was being removed on Sunday...not imposed.<br /><br />Despite these disappointing flaws, I still give the book five stars.  It is one of the most exciting crime thrillers I have read.

006197806X|4.0|Warning! spoiler ALERT!<br /><br />Beginning this novel immediately after reading Delirium, I was at first thinking it was going to be another long dragged out story line. I was pleasantly surprised of how fast it went. I was deeply involved with what was going on and Laren Oliver did a magnificent job telling two tales in one novel! At first I thought the back and forth from now and then chapters was going to be confusing but it all went together beautifully. My only problem with her writing is the CONSTANT need to say a word 3 times! \\"I just want to go home, home home\\" or now now now. Using the repitetion of 3 words in a row should be used sparingly and  it gets so aggravating to read. I'm sorry I just had to comment on that fact because I thought it was bad in Delirium, but its worse in this novel.  That was one reason for a 4 star.<br /><br />Next....This Julian character! OMG! I keep reading how people loved this character more than Alex! How could that be? Connecting Julian and Lena was and is impossible for me to do. This is no 18yr old male. He's a WUS! For the longest time I was reading I thought of Julian as a freaking 12yr old!! That's exactly how he comes across. Whining in his cell with Lena. \\"what do we do? Where do we go? Hey Lena, are you sleeping, can you tell me a story?\\" I mean seriously!??? So upset that she fell for this useless person! He is no Alpha Male. Lena is in charge every time all the time saving his A$$! I cant stand Julian and how some of you can say he's better than Alex I will never understand. I never felt bad for this guy, I was actually hoping Lena was going to witness his death instead of helping to save him.  Thank God Alex returns, as I knew he would....I hope he kicks Julians A$$.<br /><br />The remaining of the novel aside from Julian and Lena is amazing. The resistence and they way Laren Oliver kept it suspenseful with Lena's mother was just amazing. This novel kept me interested and made it hard for me to put down as you are interested in two stories at once. Not many authors can do this while still keeping the reader engaged. I anticipate the third book and how everything will tie together.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|we liked it. some cliche, but some not. very entertaining. i'm an easy cry-er but i didn't cry so look for that somewhere else. but we are glad we chose this movie. sheep dog!
B002T9H2MO|1.0|I was really looking forward to this one, being lauded as a critically acclaimed sci-fi film, boy were they wrong.<br /><br />Before you call this a sci-fi consider this: what if the guy was on an island instead, and was harvesting coconuts or whatever, then he dies and a clone replaces him, etc, the script would play out as the exact same thing because this is a bad drama movie with cloning thrown in for good measure. Just because a movie has clones doesn't make it a sci-fi, this movie is as much of sci-fi film as Attack of the Clones. Clones are like zombies, any idiot can write a hackneyed \\"BIG GOVERNMENT IS EVIL\\" clone story, just look at George Lucas. Moon's script SUCKS.<br /><br />I was watching the first half expecting some awesome mind-blowing complex third act that had something to do with the actual Moon, but nope, clones is all you get. \\"Ok\\" you might say, \\"it's not an M. Night Shymalamadingdong movie so it's not about the twist, it's about the journey\\", welp they failed in that regard too. The director (and I don't care who his father is, that's no excuse) is awful at mainting interest, he hasn't the first clue about the genre he's trying to ape, and Sam Rockwell alone is the only reason this turd has floated to the surface.<br /><br />I came out learning nothing new about the moon, I did not find any different perspectives on science or humanity to ponder as brain candy, and getting another hackneyed lazy \\"CORPORATIONS BAD!\\" story was the appropriately bland/unoriginal ending to a bland/unoriginal film. I was waiting anxiously for a bland predictable plot to unravel into something marvelous, but instead it actually got worse and worse until the mercifully rushed ending.<br /><br />Gerty also had almost no point, they easily could've developed his angle, but I think the real reason his character exists is so they can slap Kevin Spacey's name on this for marketing and sales purposes. Also how many scenes of the two clones getting in wacky scuffles did we have to see? It's frankly embarrasing that people consider a film where the director has to spoon feed the audience the plot as a 'sci-fi' film.<br />I've also noticed that all of my friends who say that Moon is good tend to not like sci-fi films in general, so that seems to be the jist of this movie, a sci-fi movie for people that don't like sci-fi; much like Star Wars it's just an excuse to change the location to outer space while still giving the audience a dumb predictable story.<br /><br />You're better off watching Sunshine.have to see?

B006LR0XLM|5.0|I recently purchased my first Android device (Samsung Galaxy 7.7 running Honey Comb 3.2) and asked my friends what essential applications they use all the time.  Dropbox was one of them.  Dropbox allows you to share files and images between different computers. Dropbox supports  Windows, Linux, Mac, as well as mobile devices (Android, Amazon Fire, iPad).<br /><br />Dropbox provides 2 GB of space for free, you can purchase bigger Dropboxes if you need more space.  You can also increase your space if you refer people to use Dropbox. Dropbox is secure. It uses high level of security using public key encryption (same type of security used by banks) by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and AES-256 bit encryption.  By default the files in Dropbox are private.  But it also provides a way to share files with someone else by dropping your files in the public folder.<br /><br />Dropbox is very simple to use.  You just need to install it on the computers you want to share files, secure it with a good complex password, and it creates a folder on the computers where it was installed.  As soon as you move something into that folder it becomes visible on all machines.<br /><br />This app makes it easier to manage all your devices, and I now use to move things not only between my PC and my tablet, but my PC at home and my PC at work.<br /><br />I recommend it!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

B006R1T40I|5.0|Smokey Robinson once said that most firmly established artists tend to roll right along in their careers. And that in short describes Bonnie Raitt all over. Her entire career,now going for over forty years has gone through many peaks and valleys. She took one pause in the 80's to overcome substance abuse problems. Than came back far more popular than she ever had been. Activism slowed her output again. Than ailing family members. And here she is in 2012 and back as if none of these obstacles never occurred. In all those cases,however her intentions were definitely in the right place. She's tended to act for the betterment of herself and others. And each time she re-emerges musically,her audience is very happy to hear what she has to say. She's entered into a world with a lot of new faces and the loss of a lot of old ones. Michael Jackson,Whitney Houston,James Brown,John Lee Hooker and dozens upon dozens of people from either her generation or the one before are now gone. And artists such as Susan Tedeschi have emerged very obviously influenced by her artistry. So what can an old musical hand such as Bonnie do?What she's done all of her career. Make some great music the way she does best.<br /><br />  What is this album? Lots of blues,lots of soul and just...well lots of Bonnie Raitt. Each time she makes new music,her sound is just a little better oiled. And that's amazing because she was pretty well established by the end of the 1970's too. She starts out with \\"Used To Rule The World\\",one of her great funky type numbers where she muses on how soul music and the artists who make it have begun to dessert us while things move too fast and others are taking their place. There are a couple tunes here that are extremely hit worthy even today. \\"Take My Love With You\\" is a lovely,melodic folk/soul type song that Bonnie has proved wonderful with. One of my own favorites is the witty \\"Marriage Made In Hollywood\\",kind of a slick uptempo soul/pop tune about selfish behavior and the \\"celebrities as news/war as entertainment\\" culture that's still prevalent since her last release. Goes well with some of her activism too. She also takes on some clever interpretations such as her reggae flavored take on Gerry Rafferty's \\"Right On Down The Line\\" and Bob Dylan's \\"Million Miles\\" and \\"Standing In The Doorway\\"..which are very much in the vein of the originals for the most part. She also takes on Loudon Wainright's \\"You Can't Fail Me Now\\",again capturing the spirit of the original fairly well.<br /><br />  The album is otherwise composed mostly of soft,soulful ballad type blues such as \\"Down To You\\",\\"Ain't Gonna Let You Go\\" and \\"God Only Knows\\",all with her usual reflection and whole hearted feelings. The main break comes in the form of the tougher rocking \\"Split Decision\\",in which she compares a bar room brawl with a lover to a boxing match. After all this time Bonnie is still doing what she does best very well. And that's an open ended,soulful sound that's rooted in blues but views that form as something elastic and not as a rut. She takes her rootedness and does a lot with it. That makes for the best blues,the best rock,the best soul...well pretty much the best any kind of music one can dish out. Frankly I am happy she's taken some time between releases rather than churn out a new record once every year or two. She's had a long road. Even between other albums. And this one,while no different is special to me because...I must admit it's the first Bonnie Raitt album I've had the pleasure of buying brand new. There's something about experiencing good new music when it comes out that makes you feel a little refreshed. And this is exactly the kind of \\"new music\\" that works best. Because it's at the artists discretion. And what you'll hear in this music is extremely likable.the \\"celebrities as news/war as entertainment\\" culture that's still prevalent since her last release. Goes well with some of her activism too.

The main break comes in the form of the tougher rocking \\"Split Decision\\",in which she compares a bar room brawl with a lover to a boxing match. After all this time Bonnie is still doing what she does best very well. And that's an open ended,soulful sound that's rooted in blues but views that form as something elastic and not as a rut. She takes her rootedness and does a lot with it. That makes for the best blues,the best rock,the best soul...well pretty much the best any kind of music one can dish out. Frankly I am happy she's taken some time between releases rather than churn out a new record once every year or two. She's had a long road. Even between other albums. And this one,while no different is special to me because...I must admit it's the first Bonnie Raitt album I've had the pleasure of buying brand new. There's something about experiencing good new music when it comes out that makes you feel a little refreshed. And this is exactly the kind of \\"new music\\" that works best. Because it's at the artists discretion. And what you'll hear in this music is extremely likable.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This game is so addictive.I'm just like OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG  this is soooooooooooo FUN.
B00756GKBA|3.0|After a few listens to MDNA I feel that the songs on the album in general are better than those on her previous Hard Candy, the attitude and the feel of the album overall is also better. But having said I find that most tracks aren't that special nor memorable, a few tracks are just too barbie girly sounding as with the lead single 'Give Me All Your Luvin' which to me is her worst single to date. The second single 'Girl Gone Wild' sounds very much like 'Celebration' mixed with 'Get Together' is average fare. The best track which really don't belong on this dance album is the soundtrack to her film W.E. 'Masterpiece', it is up there with her other theme tunes like 1992's 'This Used To Be My Playground' and 1994's 'I'll Remember'. A Golden Globe award well deserved and should have used that publicity to have had it released as a stand-alone single straight after the Golden Globe Awards ceremony, it would have been a big hit and further promoted her film W.E. Blood sucking Warner would have done this. A few tracks I like are 'I'm Addicted', 'Falling Free' 'Love Spent' and 'I F----d Up' (I wish this nice song didn't have the explicit lyrics, it's unneccesary and doesn't bode well in a ballad).<br /><br />As time goes by it seems to get harder and harder for artists to compete with the next generation of performers and gain the attention and loyalty of new younger audiences. Madonna had at her several peaks gained large numbers of hardcore fans across the globe whom to this day will buy her stuff every time there's a new release. To the point where albums can still enter the charts at no.1, but to those who are observant, her MDNA album dropped to no.8 in the US chart and no.7 here in the UK the second week after being no.1 for just one week. A similar thing had happened to her previous album Hard Candy, which had entered the charts at no.1 but dropped quickly the following few weeks and disappeared from the top 40 all together after a few months. This seems to indicatethat only her hardcore fans are buying her music and once they have done so the album quickly drops. Has her attempt (with the last two albums) to gain new younger audiences across the world failed and at the same time alienated some of her hardcore fans? This is the question.<br /><br />I certainly hope there'll be new peaks in her career to come.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Love this series - the characters are super interesting, the storyline captivating...this season kept you guessing until the end...and the last episode was AWESOME!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not bad. good time killer. it's pretty easy to unlock new games and keep playing through the night. easy to lose track of time too.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have to say this isn't the typical type of book I usually read.  My daughter and all of her friend had been reading it and couldn't stop talking about how much they loved it.  I wanted to read the actual book before going out and seeing the movie.<br /><br />The book started out great.  Is was very easy to read and moved along at a good pace.  After I finished the first book, I couldn't wait to start the second.  By the time I hit the third one, i had to read it all in about 3 days.  I just couldn't put it down.  The characters never seemed to act how I expected them to and the story kept turning in surprising ways.  I don't know if I even want to see the movie anymore because I doubt you can do the story justice in a couple of hours.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone.
0345803485|3.0|I began the book expecting not to like it, based on only what I heard, and nothing more. I felt that if I was going to comment on it, at least I should read it.<br /><br />50 Shades reminds me of a song that starts just above or below pitch, and the singer never quite finds his/her way. Pleasant moments in between make you forget momentarily that something is...not right, but the overall feeling at the end is a letdown. I liked the story more than I thought I would, but big problems with the theme and the writing somewhat overshadowed what, with some major editing, could have been a very good romance.<br /><br />I want to begin with the idea that this is erotica and that, thanks to this book, the genre has been given new life. 50 Shades of Grey is not erotica. To write it well, you need variety. The sex is the same every time, and it is quite vanilla. She runs her fingers through his hair--every time. He pulls her hair back so she can look at him--every time. The coupling is the same--every time. To write erotica well you need visuals, you need feelings, you need to make your reader tingle and tighten right along with her, or him. The reader of 50 Shades learns that when turned on, those tingles reached Ana all the way `down there' (italics on 'there' are the author's, not mine). For some reason, the author felt that having Ana's `inner goddess' and her `subconscious' rear their clueless heads throughout the book in lieu of learning Ana's true feelings was the best route. In fact, I believe the author was hiding behind these props because the idea of writing the more erotic names for genitalia was undoable for her. And, I'm sorry. In erotica, this language is essential--otherwise, it's romance.<br /><br />Sadly, the reader is not treated to what Ana is feeling during all the generic-same-sex, during which she climaxes every time (congratulations) in the exact same way. The author did not feel obligated in any way to switch things up, make each scene a bit different, maybe introduce some oral sex, some anal play--something else besides inserting tab A into slot B. From the kink standpoint, the scenes in the Red Room of Pain (silly) were too quick and, frankly, very dull and generic for those familiar with BDSM. The author breezed through the scenes (only 3) so quickly that I didn't have time to get into the scene myself. It all just got glossed over somehow, in favor of the romance and the psychological twist that is Christian. The book would have been so much better if we could have seen how twisted Christian was, instead of being told.<br /><br />Christian as a true Dominant becomes a hard sell once he threatens to spank her and then does not follow through. For fans of erotica, BDSM and spanking in particular, this was incredibly unsatisfying. For me, from that first error in judgment, the book became a formulaic romance with (gasp) a troubled, tortured hero and the seemingly normal woman who tries to save him. Nothing unique here. The author's unfamiliarity and obvious discomfort with a subject matter like BDSM was evident in so many ways; the most glaring to me was the heroine Ana's reference to a spanking Christian gave her as 'hitting'. A Dom would immediately correct her on that, pointing out the cavernous difference between hitting and spanking, yet Christian used the term 'hitting' himself toward the end when he punished her for some transgression. For a Dom to say, 'I am going to hit you...' is so wrong, that the only conclusion I could come to is that the author did not do her research--or she did, and it made her uncomfortable. So, then don't write BDSM erotica. Write romance. But, for God's sake (and ours), get it right.<br /><br />Now I'll move on to the biggest disappointment about 50 Shades, and that is the writing. The author has not met an adverb or an adjective she doesn't love, and so as not to play favorites, she uses them all with equal vigor, which takes the reader immediately out of the story. `Greatlyrelieved' (is there any other kind?),  `blond woman smiles pleasantly...' (is there ever a smile that is unpleasant?) These are juvenile mistakes that I hope the good editors at Vintage will correct. The other habit the author must be broken of is her references to her `inner goddess' and her `subconscious'. It's irritating by the third reference, and downright cringe-worthy by the 333rd. The author also filled a lot of page space by the innumerable `oh my's, `holy cow's, and the constant reminder to the reader that Christian was good-looking and that Ana was into him. Take all the above out and you have a novella, but a good one. Oh, and it's OK to be British in Seattle. Both characters are so obviously British; so introduce them as British. To NOT acknowledge that, yet pepper the book with so much Brit-speak, AGAIN, takes the reader out of the story.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but what's the point? This is review number thousand-and-something, and I'm saying the same things many others are saying. That this is the book that is getting wives back into bed with their husbands is wonderful but somewhat surprising, given the very generic subject matter and the immature writing style. I have to say that I would re-read after Vintage gets hold of it, just to see what changes they make. It will be interesting to see what the motivation was for Vintage to pick this book up. Was it to produce a good book and promote a somewhat promising author, or was it to ride on the back of a horse that has already crossed the finish line? We shall see.relieved' (is there any other kind?),  `blond woman smiles pleasantly...' (is there ever a smile that is unpleasant?)

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game! I like how it gives you tasks to complete and you are able too actually shoot animals and go fishing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is the best version of the Bible to use on my kindle fire. Its easy to use and understand, and the features, highlighting and being able to share a scripture verse easy, I love it!!!
B004EJUMT2|5.0|Go to YouTube and watch a video of these people live. You must admit, it's a gimmick. However, the \\"evil clergy\\" getup is served up on so obvious a plate that you can't help but to sing along. The songs are catchy and they're very talented. I just saw them live with Opeth and Mastodon in NYC, and they put on a fine show. This reminds me of \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" in that it's goofy yet very, very good. Here's looking forward to album #2.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|what a fantastic game. simple to control with on screen arrows.....very fun! not frustrating or too difficult. I'll be playing this game a lot
B005K17RU0|3.0|perfectly fine app but pales in comparison to weather bug features.  Too bad that app isn't available on kindle yet
B0055SWM08|5.0|so far I'm really enjoying this game.  it has good music and graphics and the puzzles are well thought out.  worth the price.
B0063GORYU|5.0|After a few times, it just may become your favorite solitaire. Share it with your parents and grandparents - a great strategy game for all.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|cool game and I like the other story games but for me they take up a lot of time. don't mean to rain on your parade but I wake up play the game, come home from school, play the game becuase I get freaked out Irkutsk food spoils and my customer happiness goes down. its a great and fun games but I am going to have to delete them because in the morning they take to much of the little time I have to get ready.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Amusing way to kill time. Good graphics. cute character. Perfect for Kindle Fire. I definitely have fun playing this game.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this games sooooooo addictive. I played the old school one which was fun and as old memories are probably not as. fun as i think but im lovin this so far and it was freeee !
0736092269|5.0|Brilliant purchase excellent for fitness instructors starting out.the book covers muscle groups stretches and injuries. a must have for fitness professionals
B005K0HDGE|1.0|My only evaluation of this book boils down to one word and one word only which happens to be BORING!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app isn't bad for a freebie. the games seem simple and easy but deceivingly so. would like it if completing one group unlocked the next.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just like Mario but waaaaay easier great for killing time fun for the whole family even the dog all the dogs
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is completely addictive and takes up most of my down time and is a great think to let little kids play while in class
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy playing this version of solitaire. It is just enough of a challenge that it doesn't become mundane. I like to play against the clock to see how fast I can solve the game. Recommend it to my friends when they say they are bored.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a fun little game. I wish you didn't have know other people that play it to finish some goals though.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|This is one of the Baddest SciFi movies i've ever seen. Excellent story and Visuals. Awesome Femme Fatale. Though a little rough for younger audiences,However, Believe it or not, the story is one of decency. It is helpful to see the series \\"Fire Fly\\" for better understanding of story line, character development and context, but not at all necessary, there is a very good lead in. I have<br />seen and can see this film many, many times. well worth owning. I have both \\"Fire Fly\\" and \\"SERENITY\\".
B0052GACNM|5.0|I saw the 'making of the album' on PBS and had to purchase it.  So glad I could find it on-line.<br />I recommend listening with a 'friend'
B0055SWM08|3.0|Not too shabby of a time killer, especially because the levels do get harder. Reminds me of several games out there, like &quot;cut the rope&quot; but with a different twist.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is fun. I wish you could get energy easier without having to buy it. other than that its great!!
B007JRU2UK|1.0|Life is hard. We know, we live it everyday. Why someone in Hollywood needed to make this very, very depressing movie is beyond my comprehension. In these times, we escape to another place for a short time to escape our daily problems. The plot of this movie attempts to extend misery to an absurd level. If I was sitting in a theater, I would have walked out.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun and has a lot of different games to choose from. some are kind of hard but that just makes you want to play them more and get better.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game. I especially love the fact that I can play the winning deal and compete with others as far as timing. I'm 50 years old and this game is a good mental exercise game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|was this app based on Mario? it is fun and addictive. make more in a set!!! It is fun!! I recomend this for 6 to 10 year olds. BE AWARE THAT THIS APP IS ADDICTING
1118109791|5.0|The Official Guide book for the GMAT exam is the essential standard book you need for the GMAT exam.  At over 800 pages (839 pages!) it's plenty to work with - plenty of opportunities to catch your mistakes in practice so you don't make the same ones on the actual exam.<br /><br />In the past 3 years, everyone's been using OG12 (12th edition) to study for their GMATs. Certainly, every few years there's a few updates. This 13th edition update is bigger for a variety reasons.<br /><br />There's a new section called integrated reasoning (on-screen calculator, 12 questions with multiple subquestions, 30 min, NO partial credit), and a small slight change in mix of questions for SC and for CR.<br /><br />There is no where else to get practice questions for Integrated Reasoning (at least for the first few months) without getting them from the Official Guide or the GMATPrep 2.0 software. (You can get the IR separately, see link below)<br /><br />The questions are as official as they can be.<br /><br />83% of the OG13 questions are the same as the OG12 questions. They basically removed 17% of the old questions and replaced them with new questions - so you're not getting *more* questions - you're simply getting questions that are most reflective of the latest version of the exam.<br /><br />There are 907 questions - 158 of them are NEW, which is 17% of the questions. There is an additional 50 Integrated Reasoning questions but these questions are not in the book. You have to access them with a username/password and Access Code on a companion website to the book -<br /><br />[can't provide URL due to filtering but gwhizmobile is the domain name and GMAC is the directory]<br /><br />*******************<br />Now, onto the sections:<br /><br />***********************<br />Integrated Reasoning -<br /><br />THIS SECTION IS NOT IN THE BOOK - it's an online component with 50 questions, which you can access with an account. The book has 11 pages dedicated to introducing you to the Integrated Reasoning section - it introduces the 4 types of questions which takes up the bulk of it in the book. But the practice questions are online. Here are the question types:<br /><br />1) Multi-source Reasoning<br />2) Table Analysis<br />3) Graphics Interpretation<br />4) Two Part Analysis<br /><br />Once on the online site, you'll signup with your access code. All future logins will use your email address. The IR section DOES allow you to use an on-screen calculator - so get used to using it! - while the other normal sections do not.<br /><br />******************<br />Integrated Reasoning Questions - wow, some of them get really tricky because for each question, there are usually 3 sub-questions (sometimes more) and you're going to want to get ALL of them correct to get credit for that question. I went through a bunch and here are my observations:<br /><br />  1) Some really tricky questions with booby traps - complex wording you have to read through and understand<br /><br />  2) Dives into many details. Contrary to RC which is about getting the big picture main idea then occasionally diving into details, IR is about DETAILS.<br /><br />  3) Topics are much more modern business - finally. The IR questions finally stray away from historical humanities and focus on things like internet businesses, print-to-online media, IPO, consulting tables and charts. So, if you were complaining about the GMAT not being relevant to business before - you can't complain anymore. Even if the topics here are more relevant, they can STILL be tricky. I repeat, tricky!<br /><br />  4) Multiple steps to get to the right answer: You're going to need to jot down some notes on a piece of paper showing your calculation results. Once written down, you can compare the figures and figure out the right answer.<br /><br />  5) On-screen calculator - Yes, this section permits use of a calculator but it is an on-screen calculator. I did in fact find myself playing around using the MR, MS and M+ buttons - I had never really learned how to use them in school but yes, they can be helpful for the questions involving multiple calculations - which I did see in many of the IR questions.<br /><br />  6) Graphic charts are very similar to what you'll see in business consulting. Bar charts, pie charts, and even XYZ Bubble charts. I'm hoping to see a waterfall chart one day...<br /><br />  7) Colors! Unlike the old exam which is completely black and white, the IR section includes some COLORS in its graphs and charts. So yes, more in tune with the modern world - you might see a scatterplot of points in red / blue / black or green colors!<br /><br />If you are only interested in the IR section you can purchase it here for $10 (cheaper than ~$25 for the book):<br /><br />[ can't provide URL but it's in the MBA dot com store with product ID 5032 ]<br /><br />*****************<br /><br />VERBAL<br /><br />Sentence Correction (158)- Similar to the way it was before, SC is basically a sentence with an underlined portion. Your job is to figure out if that underlined portion of the sentence is the optimal way of writing - or whether one of the remaining 4 answer choices offers a better, more clearer way of communicating that same idea. GMAC folks have been slowly pushing in more questions that are related to meaning and fewer questions related to idioms.<br /><br />*****************<br />Critical Reasoning (141) - This section is more or less the same with the exception of a greater emphasis on questions that ask you to fill in the blank and complete the logical argument.<br /><br />*****************<br />Reading Comprehension (156) - as with almost all tests, there's a reading component. This is a classic component of many standardized tests. Boring passages, boring questions. The challenge here is getting yourself excited about these boring passages so you can actually answer them and make sense of the author's argument!<br /><br />*****************<br />QUANT<br /><br />*****************<br />Problem Solving (254) - There's roughly 45 new questions in this version here. For the most part, the difficulty varies. I'd say the number of easy questions here are quite a bit. Because of the computer adaptive nature of the test, if you aim for the upper 600s and lower 700s, most likely you won't be asked some of the super easy questions here.<br /><br />*****************<br />Data Sufficiency (198) - So there's 36 new added questions in this section. The wording here seems a bit more tricky and difficult. Of course the essential thought process approach we teach to attack this infamous section of the GMAT is the same so as long as you come in with the correct attack strategy, you'll be fine.<br /><br />*****************<br />Key Takeaways<br /><br />1) The Official Guide provides the highest quality of questions to use for your preparation needs. After all, they do include actual exam questions used in the past - usually referred to as \\"retired questions\\" - so definitely good to practice with these kinds of questions.<br /><br />2) Is OG13 worth it? If you want some extra practice and also get online access to the integrated reasoning question bank - it's worth it for the price. Every serious MBA student should at least take a peek before the exam.<br /><br />3) Having said that, keep in mind OG is for practice purposes. It does not teach you how to think. And certainly don't expect their explanations to guide you to the path of enlightenment. There's a reason why everybody buys the OG but still not everyone gets a top score. Certainly the book is necessary - but by no means an automatic ticket to the top MBA club.<br /><br />*****************<br />Let's apply a fun logic / critical reasoning game here.<br />Statement: Buying OG13 will get me a 700+ score.<br /><br />There is a flaw in this statement! Getting access to official exam questions does not imply that you can answer that type of question when presented in another form. Nor doesbuying the book indicate that you can answer it under time-pressured environments. OG provides practice questions - not exam strategy, which is its only weakness. I'd say exam strategy is well over 50% of the exam.<br /><br />That said, OG is the standard. There really is no reason to rate this book 3 star or 4 star - it's the standard for this exam so it gets a 5 star. GMAC is not here to train how your brain thinks - it's here to give you sample questions from past exams. And that's exactly what it does.

B005GYGCOI|1.0|I have used Lonely Planet guide books for over 25 years and probably 22 of 28 international trips, including 2 of my 3 earlier trips to India.  I admire the company and many of their guidebooks.  I have also traveled in over 120 countries.  LP India is a good guide book with the information one expects from Lonely Planet.  It is the Kindle edition that I find awful.<br />I like the Kindle and Kindle books, but the LP India guidebook has no real map of India.  Much worse, the state maps of India are little more than blobs, where I can not even read the city names with powerful reading glasses.  These can not be blown up at all...they might as well skip the maps of the states.  Almost as bad are the city maps.  They are the full regular city maps, but too small to really see more than the shape of the city.  Then they break down the city map into smaller sections or \\"tiles\\".  The continuity of these \\"tiles\\" makes any navigation difficult to impossible...almost like trying to view a jig saw puzzle by looking at all the scattered pieces.<br />Another major complaint is trying to find the page for, say, Agra.  If you type in Agra, you will have to wade through maybe 100 places Agra is mentioned before you get to the Agra chapter...slow, tedious, and inefficient. I also miss the photos and highlight pages.  If you buy the Kindle LP India, be sure to bring along a good map of India...you will need it.
B004LWZW7E|3.0|Classism crap. Good movie. Point well taken, but classism crap. Timberlake is really a good actor. He only has the stars in front of him. He will make a greater lead actor in the future. Amanda Seyfried delivered as usual, just like she did in Little Red Ridding Hood and every thing else I have seen her in. The movie is original, though the theme is not. Liberal wackos will love the premise, Myself, a simple fan of action, \\"David and Goliath, and romance movies, enjoyed every minute. The rich have, at the expense of the poor. These two champions, one a convert, fight to right that central wrong. Enter a zealous time cop and an unscrupulous thug and you have the ingredients, but the cook came up a little short. I liked it, but I can understand if the masses don't. The blaring theme was a bit too liberal and too political. Too much classism; far too ostentatious. The romance between the two leads came up a little short. A little fairer writing and the movie would have been a lot better. All in all , I do not regret buying it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome game but if you like this game get pet shop story same deal but with out all the ice age stuff
B0015DYIH2|1.0|You have got to be kidding me... I was really dissapointed when i finished Eclipse, i felt so bad for jacob, i wanted it to be Jacob and Bella, not Edward and Bella. I was starting to lose interest in Edward. When I finished eclipse, i was excitied to read breaking dawn to see if it turned around. Thank God i read the reviews first. .....  so dissapointed..... who is Bella suppose to be anyway? whats so special about her? personally i think she's a ......jerk.. i dont understand why everyone likes her so much. Edward, Jacob,Mike,Quil...... sigh... i just think steph could have done a much better job....... much better...... for all those people out there that are depressed shocked dissapointed, i reccomend The Hunger Games Trilogy. i liked those books allot...<br /><br />sorry for bad spelling/grammer/whatever
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was an amazing story.  Not just \\"Mommy Porn\\" as it was described on Good Morning America.  I hope to read more books like this, Edgy, Sexual, but with a great story line as well!  Well done!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is great for kindle fire. This is the best weather app I've seen in the app store. I highly recommend this to the people that want a weather app. You even have the options to change the background and get a notification on the notification bar about the weather outside currently.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Stunning. Wonderful. Tear-jerker.<br />So many superlatives spring to mind to describe this book. A clear five star read from the master. Everything has already been said in the other reviews - but I wanted to say thank you - the first book that has made me cry in a long time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is one awesome game on the kindle one reason why I like it is because there is a different variety of games to play
0679411585|5.0|I learned about this book from the movie, I saw the movie first and read the book later. This novel is far superior than the film. I spent a week to two weeks reading this. I highly recommend this book if you are interested in the Vietnam War.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Doesn't always connect properly, even when my data connection is solid. Otherwise, good app. Lots of versions. Need more downloadable versions.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love these books!!! I can't even begin to tell you how awesome this book is. The tension, suspense, characters, action, plot...everything is so amazing. Suzanne Collins a great writer. Word of Caution: DO read the book before seeing the movie...just saying..
B000000OUJ|5.0|GZA dropped something with this album that is very rare. It grabs you emotionally, you feel the intensity of the lyrics in your bones, and RZA's beats set an atmosphere that sucks you into the record. I've got nothing bad to say about the album; GZA is really one of the most intelligent MC's out there and sounds like a poetic guru the way he pours his rhymes out on this.<br /><br />- Most of the Clan guest on different songs on this and they for the most part deliver some of their best moments ever. Ol Dirty even appears here and does wonders for the song he guests on. If there was ever a sequel to the original \\"Enter the 36 Chambers\\", I'd have to say that \\"Liquid Swords\\" reminds me the most of it and in some ways even improves on the original formula.<br /><br />- This album is extremely intense and makes you think. It may have movie samples and talk about the streets but the GZA goes intellectual with his lyrics and has a way of getting you to hang on his every word. With RZA being paired with GZA in one way or another this entire album, it's apparent that GZA brings out a side of RZA that I'd like to hear more. \\"B.I.B.L.E.\\", the last song on the album, is amazing in the sense that it makes a lot of valid points without losing flow or power and raises some questions that needed some awareness.<br /><br />Point is: If you own a couple Wu-Tang albums and don't know where to go from where you're at, go here and you'll love this.<br /><br />Everybody who's a fan of Wu-Tang knows what I'm talking about already most likely.<br /><br />This is an album every rap fan should own in my opinion. Buy it.
B002KE47Z8|2.0|Story has to have beginning, middle and end. Some of stories, she has just done the background work and the story ends.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Excellent application. This handles documents better than any other office program I've found and is well worth the $15. I love the Dropbox integration. With this, I know that no matter what happens to my tablet, my documents will be safe. I wish it would better integrate so that if you saved when offline, it'd immediately upload the next time you turned on WiFi.<br /><br />My only other issue with this app is it seems to frequently crash on my Toshiba Thrive. This can be a problem, because I use this app to take notes in class, and when it crashes, it takes a while for me to get the file open again from the Dropbox section. If I choose just to open the recovered file, when I save it, it doesn't upload as it should and none of my changes ever get applied.<br /><br />Despite the aforementioned anomaly, I highly recommend this app and would buy it again in a heartbeat.
1607050072|5.0|I am relatively new to the world of sewing and embroidery.  I received this as a gift for Christmas and have to say that I LOVE it so far.  I must admit that I am biased, being a fan of most things Scandinavian, particularly Scandinavian design and style.<br /><br />Like many creative endeavors, sewing can be influenced by looking at others' projects and ideas, even if you don't follow them to a tee. This book is great for helping spark creativity.  I used some of the applique patterns that the author had used on pillow covers and made dish towels instead.  The patterns were easy to work with and ended up looking great on my towels.  I also used one of her machine quilting patterns on my first ever attempt at quilting and had good results.  The written instructions and photographs were very easy to follow.<br /><br />Overall a great book for new and intermediate sewers.  Her designs are so simple yet classic that I think most people would be able to find something they like.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I first played this game at my friends house looked fun but when l got it I loved it even more than before. the controls are easy to master and are fun to play with.

B005LLXB9K|5.0|Huge Pearl Jam fan. I love this band so much. I have all studio albums. Seen them several times live and they rock out. I own the the book and 20cd and 20dvd.<br /> Rudy!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are very fun and enjoyable.  if you want fun make sure to get the limeted time game's, but they should be for more than an hour!
B0073ODRKG|5.0|It seems by the reviews here that many Madonna purists are quite disgruntled by this collection.  But, if you're a fan but not a fanatic, have an appreciation for Madonna's talent and music but haven't yet purchased most of her albums, here's a great opportunity for a nice collection of her studio albums for a reasonable price.  It's actually quite nicely put together.  I suppose either you like the box or you don't, but it seems decent enough and opens nicely to reveal each disc in a sleeve that matches the original album's cover art front and back.  The discs themselves seem to be the original artwork if you were to buy each CD individually.  No, you don't get the liner notes for each album, but, for the vast majority be honest -- don't you look at the liner notes perhaps once, then seldom, if ever, again?  So it's not a terrible omission and it allows the cost of this nice collection to remain affordable.  True, it would be nice if someday a grander box set could be released that includes all of Madonna's albums, not just the studios, in addition to some cool extras and art in line with Madonna's innovative style, but for the purpose of what this set is, it's a good idea and just what I was needing.  Ever since Madonna's Super Bowl performance I got reinterested in her music and realized there were many of her albums I was missing, so this came along at just the right time.  Whether Madonna herself would approve, who knows.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it has tons of games. but it takes a while to build up points. it is also easy enough for my daughter to use.
B007MC868M|5.0|(4.5 stars) In this seventh novel in the Harry Hole series to be translated into English, author Jo Nesbo, with over eleven million thrillers in print, continues to detail Harry's fight against the symbolic \\"white whales\\" of injustice. Here, all Harry's experience and knowledge as an Oslo policeman are readied for the biggest fight of his life, one to which he willingly makes a complete emotional commitment. Though he has lived in Hong Kong in self-imposed exile for three years, Harry has just learned that Oleg, the son of Rakel, the love of his life, is now jailed on remand in Oslo for the murder of a drug dealer.  Harry has always had problems with alcohol, bureaucratic nonsense, and self-control, even during his career with the Oslo Police, and he has battle scars, both visible and invisible, which have made him a cynical man, but he immediately returns to Oslo to review the case, hoping that he can save Oleg, who has always thought of him as \\"Dad.\\"<br /><br />What follows is the most emotionally involving of all the Harry Hole novels to date.  Readers should be cautioned, however, that the mainstream press, in their reviews, have included a number of unforgivable spoilers, and one of them in the UK nearly ruined this book for me.  This is a book that will strike chords with diehard Harry Hole fans throughout the world, though Nesbo does not give as much background information as many new readers may want in order to appreciate the action surrounding Harry and Oleg and their history.<br /><br />(No spoilers.)  Gusto, a friend of Oleg for several years, has been working for an Oslo drug dealer nicknamed \\"Dubai,\\" who controls \\"violin,\\" the most addictive new drug ever to have appeared on Oslo's busy drug scene and for which there is the biggest demand in the city. Dubai is in the catbird seat, eliminating his competition, and when the supply of violin itself begins to dry up due to a shortage of materials relative to demand, Harry begins to investigate whether Dubai and his street dealers are being protected by police and politicians.<br /><br />Nesbo is a bit \\"cute\\" (or darkly humorous) at the beginning, which he tells from the point of view of a rat trying, unsuccessfully, to reach its hungry babies. The body of a wounded young drug addict is blocking her access to them. The point of view then switches to that of the dying young man, Gusto, who is reviewing the circumstances of how he ended up where he is, providing information which connects later with other aspects of the plot.  This pattern repeats at the beginning of the next two sections. Phantom provides enough action to keep even the jaded reader actively engaged, however, and Harry is a constantly moving target who must tread carefully, remembering that a misstep can endanger both Oleg and Rakel. Occasionally, the details of the various thread lines become a bit fuzzy and some local slang (not familiar in the US) can sometimes be mystifying.  Parts of the story are absurd, even bleakly funny, in retrospect, but Nesbo's pacing will keep most readers reading so fast they will not stop to question what is happening.  Ultimately, Nesbo brings this novel to a blockbuster conclusion in emotional and cinematic fashion. Readers who have read the previous Harry Hole novels will not want to miss this one, preferably before the spoilers begin to get more publicity than the novel itself.

B007R41E8O|4.0|I like these kinds of games. This is one of the more interesting ones. Having fun playing it. Well worth 99 cents.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|my kids love this game! we play it together everyday on the kindle.  it gives them something to do when we travel and keeps them occupied.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I'd like to be able to see it when Bruce crosses over and approaches the pearly gates.  I think St. Peter will greet him with a big grin and a back-slapping hug.  Bruce is certainly doing what he was put on earth to do:  tug at consciences, give voice to those without, remind us of our American history (like Carnegie's union-busting, etc.), feed our will to keep-on-keepin'-on, and to inspire us to listen to our inner voice of God.  And all this with the intellect of a musicologist combined with the heart of a bluesman and the soul of rock'n'roll.  The social-political spirit of this collection dovetails nicely with Woody Guthrie's upcoming 100th birthday this summer.  Have a box of tissues handy for your first listen.  Great album.  My only reservation is the two references to gun violence as resolution of frustration.  Overall, a moving work of art.  Thanks, Mr. Springsteen!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's an outstanding book. My heart was pounding for nearly the entire time. I really never wanted to put it down. The second book is pretty good, I didn't put it down, much. The third book is kinda crappy - it took me weeks to finish it as it's just not very good. The first in the series is where you'll get your moneys worth. And to be perfectly honest it doesn't matter very much that #2 & 3 aren't as good - because the 1st one can stand all on its own.
B000FA6720|5.0|I love the CD and movie so am Happy to have this book to complete the collection.<br />I haven't read it  yet but it is on my to do list.<br />The worlds' best love story.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Bought this for my ipod docking player.  With my iphone case, it wouldn't fit in the dock.  This adapter works great.  I would say it leaves the iphone a little high off of the docking player, but it hasn't done anything to damage the phone or the dock.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! In a world where kids seem to be out of control this book shows that it doesn't have to be that way. I like the way she tells it through the eyes of trying to bring up her own kids. Even just learning about a lot of the French ways of life is very interesting. Highly recommend!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy this game to wind down right before going to sleep.  It promotes just enough thought to relax me and take my mind off the stresses of the day.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Many different versions, languages, audio and other features.  This is an absolute must have. I reccommend this Bible app to everyone when they ask for a good Bible app.
B007FZVWFA|5.0|This was a good aliens attack Russia movie.  I enjoyed that it didn't go too far or become too campy either.  Aliens attack earth...  youngers in Moscow run and hide, flee and bond, learn and become emboldened and flee and fight.  Was this a good thriller?  yes.  Was it a movie everyone will be talking about for 20 years...?  Nyet.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I read this book because I'm into the whole romance thing right now and the idea of first love and crazy infatuation sounded enticing.  The way the story began was pretty interesting and kept me wanting to find out what would happen between Abby (Pigeon...really?) and Travis.  What was to follow was a series of fake feeling sub plots and unbelievable interactions between all of the characters.  I found myself rolling my eyes pretty consistently at the things that were said in this story.  The ending felt totally contrived and I mentally kick myself for continuing to read even though the story had no redeeming qualities.  Also, I had the kindle version and there were quite a few editorial mistakes.<br />Anyway, this book wasn't for me and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who enjoys more complex character development, characters you can fall in love with, and a romance that shakes you, because this didn't deliver.
B002WTC92E|2.0|I didn't like Devil Wears Prada because the main character was whiny and entitled, but at least that book had a good plot and character development. This one is so formulaic with the \\"three/four women friends who are all very different, blah blah\\" which always turns me off from the get-go. It's blatantly obvious what's going to happen to the main character, who has the \\"perfect\\" boyfriend; the \\"Latina lover\\" is just an annoying caricature; and the \\"mouse\\" was too mousy. I have no problems with chick lit being predictable--that's part of the enjoyment. But the only character who was semi-likable to me was the main one, and no one's THAT oblivious in real life. The whole thing made me long for a good Judith Krantz novel.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Super cool!  Lots of fun with varied puzzles and scenery.  I would characterize it most like The Mystery of the Crystal Portal,  in my experience.  The price is beyond fair.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|Yep, I pass as an intellectual on good days, but my deep dark secret is I'm a sucker for Sophie Kinsella books. This one is almost as enjoyable as the original Shopaholic (which, along with Bridget Jones, is my gold standard for chick lit). Yep, we all know where it's going and exactly what is going to happen, but it's sure fun getting there! The main character is fun and the business angle of the plot is interesting. This is a great beach/plane read that will have you smiling.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|intense and possibly future if we are not vigilent,characters are real you feel you know them. Grips your imagination and your sorrows and empathy.  Pray it never comes close to this.  Our world is always fighting wars and some one always wants dominence. Veryreal and frightening at times,  also shows human will to survive.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great way to pass the time in the hospital ....waiting to pass a quarter. all money should be paper. good news I'm going home.

B0070BG10U|5.0|Beautiful compositions to remember the sinking ship. Great orchestration. Really a good piece of music! Particularly Triumph. There is Robin Gibb beyond the BeeGees...
B004T4LUPW|1.0|too much trouble to set up.  my life is too fast paced to mess with it. lost money on this one.
B006H5120E|5.0|I viewed the 3D release of the movie at the Hollywood Arclight Cinerama Dome.  I figured if anyone could properly retrofit a 2D movie and make it 3D, James Cameron would be the one.  For the most part that is true.  There are, however, some scenes that missed the boat (bad pun, I know).  The scenes of the ship in its entirety seemed not quite sharp.  The wide shot of the ship at the dock seemed fuzzy, but the closeups of the people on the dock have good 3D perspective.  A couple of interior scenes appeared to have no 3D (looked the same with or without the 3D glasses, while the shot of the table setting in the dining room was exquisitely done.  The underwater scenes had excellent depth (another bad pun).  I had been waiting for a blu ray release of the film because anything had to be better than the original DVD, but the reason I decided to pay extra for 3D is that the scenes after the Titanic hits the iceberg and until it sinks, make you feel like you are really there.  I expect the sound on the blu ray will be much better than it was on the DVD.<br /><br />I usually try not to review a product before it is released, but felt the 3D version was a significant improvement over the original and deserved some comment.  When the discs are released, I'll update this review if anything notable occurs.

B003Y5H542|5.0|I LOVE this movie. My only complaint is that Clint Eastwood was not the Spirit of the West. That would have made the movie for me. Even so, the movie was full of humor, paradoxes, and lots of fun. The mayor talks about the future, and that the old west was going to die while we see modern Las Vegas in another scene. Fun for all.  Bravo
0062119044|3.0|Effective epistolary writing ranks very high on my list and Shriver crafts her letters with vivid commentary and dialogue. This novel describes how modern life raising a sociopath or a child with such destructive anger that sometimes seems fantastical rather than fictional.  I was moved (and frightened) many times by Eva's narrative, although her ambivalence about child rearing and unconditional love was  clear.  Does it raise questions about parenting?  Yes. For me the scene where she wallpapers her room  with maps only to have Kevin deface it all symbolized the tense  mother-son relationship most dramatically for me. It is also very disturbing to read about the harrowing school system where Kevin suffered and provoked  suffering--why do so many schools reflect the worst aspects of culture,  even though they appear to offer socializing, academic exchange,  and safety? Sigh.  Some might say those fellow students were caricatures, but adolescent cruelty apparently runs very deep.<br /> I did ask myself questions about Eva and Franklin's communities  or the lack thereof in suburbia.  In my experience I found Manhattan,  Princeton, and Philadelphia places where church communities  served as tremendously supportive groups to young mothers and  families of all kinds.  While Kevin's particular case would probably send any community-- religious, athletic, political or ethnic-- to its edges, I do wonder if any abiding friendships could have offered  some solace to Eva?  Then maybe she hoped to protect others from Kevin?<br /> Shriver raises questions about post-modern acedia and \\"crime and  punishment\\" themes.  She mentions forgiveness when she characterizes  Celia and holds out a hand to condemned Kevin at the end, but what if this well-read narrator delved into some of Dostoyevksy's thoughts?<br /> She touches on identity formation and moral nurturing, but Kevin's  very nature leaves so much out. All in all a fascinating read, even though very troubling.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|I got this app and lived it! it would let me edit pics right from my gallery. but now it wont let me edit the pics in my gallery! it will let me go to my gallery and chose a pic, but then it goes back to the menu and darkens like its going to load but never does. once they fix that problem: 5 stars for sure!!

B004IJZFP4|4.0|This album marks my first Tommy Bolin CD.  I had heard of him prior to buying this, but never knew much about his life, career, or playing style.  And I must say, he still remains something of an enigma to me.  His story is pretty common in the annals of rock music: young player struggles for a hew years to make it big, finally does, lends out talent to a few different bands, goes solo, succumbs to pernicious temptations, dies a tragic and premature death after overdosing.  And though this tale had been told and retold before, I nevertheless find Tommy Bolin's story unique.  He was in two pretty high profile bands (The James Gang and Deep Purple) before going solo.  He released only two solo albums (Teaser and Private Eyes).  And he inspired countless other guitarists in his wake.<br /><br />What makes him so unique in my view is the eclecticism in his playign style.  He seemed to be very versatile.  At once he can sound like Rory Gallagher, and the next Jeff Beck.  He plays slow, melodic tunes, and then shreds with the controlled force of one who's been playing for decades.  And his singing voice is several notches above that of the usual guitar god.<br /><br />This album, Teaser, has some wonderful playing on it.  \\"Wild Dogs\\" is jaw dropping; \\"Teaser\\" and \\"Dreamer\\" and lovely tunes, and \\"Savannah Woman\\" is a cool little number.<br /><br />Recommended to fans of incendiary or melodic guitar music.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Sure I would like more energy sometimes, but that also makes it part of the fun because you are always challenged to make the best use of it.
0307593312|5.0|1Q84 is an elegantly written novel with constant little surprises as the plot unfolds. It is full of damaged individuals in a somewhat Kafkaesque world. Some of the subject matter is difficult - pedophilia, murder and suicide. The writing and translation are smooth and engaging and the dialogue is exceptionally realistic. Even the minor characters are multi-dimensional, leaving the reader wanting to know more. It is a truely unique novel. It is a combination of sci-fi, Colombo, 100 Years of Solitude, Bridge of San Luis Ray and probably more. I enjoyed using the lookup features on my Kindle Fire to quickly dig a bit deeper into the references while I read. This book is an undertaking, but one I enjoyed immensely. This is a book I will never forget!
B0055SWM08|4.0|The learning curve is perfect. You can choose to try to complete a level in the fewest moves possible for an additional challenge, but you don't have to do so in order to advance. The one (minor) negative is the music, which was great at first, but it gets annoying after listening to it for a while.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is an amazing trilogy, specially for teens, but exciting for everybody. At the same time you could have the opportunity of comparing with the movie.

1594744769|4.0|It was a good book and I liked it, but it wasn't really scary. It sorta just reminded me of goosebumps books.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|when I picked this app I expected a hard to play,  poor quality Mario type knock off. I was so pleasently surprised to play an interesting and highly entertaining game. easy enough for my young kids to play but at the same time challenging enough to be interesting without being impossibly difficult.  great graphics, great premise, please keep the updates coming!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I have been sucked into the Panem world after starting to read \\"Hunger Games\\", so I bought all three parts and read it till the end. This book is, however, too long for my taste - the action should've ended ca. in the middle of the book. I found it too made up in the end and that sort of happy ending was not really convincing. Apart from that, I loved the trilogy.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|for free its a great game no 3d animation.  I find myself playing it all the time.  truely amazaing. love it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Panem: A Marxist State<br />  Jonathan A. Meyer<br />  Excelsior College<br /><br />  Author Note<br />  This paper was prepared for English 102, English Composition, taught by Professor Kissel<br /><br />  The United States of America have often been described as the \\"land of opportunity\\": a place where hard work, dedication and service pay great dividends to the opportunist.  From her economic well-spring, much abundance flows.  Freedom of Speech and Assembly are guaranteed by her Bill of Rights.  Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action enable any person to have a chance to succeed and to be their own provider. For over 400 years now, refugees flocked to her soil for a fresh start. But what if she ceased to be this symbol of independence?<br />  Suzanne Collins, author of the The Hunger Games envisions just such a place in \\"Panem, the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America (Loc. 237-241)\\". Panem, what I believe to be a Marxist society, is nothing like the forefathers planned for America. Marxism, a socioeconomic ideal, is most-centered around a \\"continuous conflict between capitalist oppressors and oppressed working people... primary influence on life was economic (Roberts, 300)\\".<br />  Panem used to be a country of 13 surrounding districts but after the outlying citizens rebelled, the thirteenth was destroyed as an example to not defy the Capitol.  Now, oppression and destitution are the way of life for most of Panem's citizens in its 12 Districts, except the wealthy citizens of the Capitol.  Each person's occupation is predetermined in that they work on the abundant resource available to them in their district and there is little to circumvent this harsh reality. Most people cannot afford to make a living but only a surviving.  Many resort to poaching, haggling and even begging to survive. To keep its citizens in check, the Capitol has devised a \\"reward campaign\\" to alleviate starvation for one family once a year. This event is called \\"The Hunger Games.\\"<br />  Designed as a suppression tactic by the Capitol to keep the districts in line, the games are a lottery/tournament style competition. However, this is where the sadism enters Panem's society. While the districts are mandated to view the gladiator-style Games, 24 contestants a year fight for the prize of guaranteed food rations for the rest of their lives. The winner has to mentor new contestants from their district and help train them in the following years. Also, the tournament is between children above the age of twelve. When a child turns 12, their name is entered in one time. At 13, the name is entered twice and so on until the age of 18. So as your age increases, so do the odds of selection.<br />  The drafting of the children, or \\"reaping,\\" supports that the Capitol is punishing the districts for their disobedience, or sins. \\"Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap\\" (Galatians 6:7, Eastern Standard Version). Simply put, what a person does is repaid to them often more abundantly, in this life or the next. Parents are forced to see their children subject to the possibility of horrible deaths from their past transgressions. Many totalitarian governments act as a deity or remove the deity of their society and not allow their people to worship freely.<br />The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old girl sacrifices her \\"freedom\\" and volunteers to take the place of her 12-year-old sister, Primrose. Katniss ends up overcoming tremendous odds and difficulties in \\"The Hunger Games\\" and is victorious over famine and the Capitol. She singlehandedly rallies people from several districts and other supporters from the Capitol called \\"sponsors\\" in believing in her. She has defied the Capitol and she is sure to pay for her actions in the sequel called \\"Catching Fire.\\"<br />  Panem, is far from the ideals that shaped America. Oppression, humiliation and mutilation are things no person should endure. Freedom to make choices for one's self and their loved ones should be available for all. America may be imperfect but she still shines a beacon of light to tattered nations around the globe.<br /><br />  Works Cited<br /><br />Collins, S. (2008). The Hunger Games.

B0063IH60K|4.0|solitaire is pretty fun but I always loose my big bro and I always play it and it is fun but I don't like the pop up adds
B007R41E8O|1.0|Purchased the game for Kindle Fire. Unfortunately, the game constantly crashes especially at the fuse installation part at the boat. I had to quit out of frustration due to that. Hopefully some updates will be applied soon or customers will be paying for a game they can only play half of.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this app it so fun to play in spare time if ur not doing anything you should get it (:
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Enjoyed seeing this movie so much!  Everyone in the world but I seemed to have seen it!  Got it for $1.99 on download too!
B005FMZWD8|5.0|I bought this for everyday use and could not be happier.  I initally wanted to exchange for the brown leather strap vertion but was unable to cancel in time over the Easter break.  The cloth strap is quite good in the flesh with the blue face.  Massive watch but I have thick wrists and this was a factor in my purchase.<br /><br />Amazon gave me a voucher for the cancellation mishap and I have put it towards another Invicta watch for my father inlaw.  Very Happy!!
B007SSEBCU|2.0|Meryl Steep was, of course, amazing in her role.<br />The problem is the script.<br />Why on earth spend so much time focusing on Thatcher in decline (alzheimers? dementia?).<br />So much more time could've been spent on the years in parliament prior to Prime Minister, and even more time on the PM years (not just the Falklands war).<br />I forced myself to watch it through to the end, but it was not enjoyable.
1932100660|5.0|After working in the Oncology (cancer) medical field for the last 10 years, I was told about this book/research study by an Oncologist physician. He mentioned that I should read it, but more impactfully, he has himself been a strictly plant-based diet follower for several years. Prior to reading The China Study (and watching the documentary Forks Over Knives), I had never heard ANY of the research findings Dr Campbell documents. As a medical professional who sees the effects of cancer daily, it is compelling evidence. So much so, that my family and I switched our diet immediately and have been eating a plant based diet only for the past 5 weeks. No, it is not easy to change a way of eating that we have been used to for a lifetime. It is definitely a learning curve for us, but we are discovering delicious new menus and fun combinations of foods. My husbands blood pressure has dropped from 160/90 to 128/77 after 4 weeks. I cannot recommend this book strongly enough. We can impact the future of healthcare one person at a time!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|An amazing classic that reminds me of how it was to be a little girl watching it for the first time!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you like Mario bros then you will like this. works great on the kindle fire and it is free
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game but when I played it today it had this weird update : before you could play, you had to watch a little clip and I got a new episode, but all the episodes where more vertical than before.  :l WEIRD

B004T4LUPW|5.0|one of the only apps I've paid for because its worth it when it syncs to google calendar so that i can share the calendar with other people and other devices. Even if you update the calendar while you dont have internet acess it will automatically sync once you do.
B007FZVWFA|5.0|Not much to say...a great movie that kept me on the edge of my seat!  There were a few \\"really\\" moments, but this is a movie about aliens...I mean so come on people...give it a break! Highly recommended!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun game. easy to play,  challenging enough to keep you interested.  a bit like the old super Mario games on the original nintendo.
1400069289|5.0|Powerfully written, entertaining, and thoroughly engaging, this book will give you practical tips on how you can make positive changes that will affect your life in the long-term. I highly recommend this book -- it's both fascinating and practical. It will make you re-think how you approach certain aspects of your life! A must-read!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I use this on my Kindle Fire to connect to a work computer. It does the job perfectly!  The set up is easy and the quick keys are very handy.  Highly recommend Splashtop Remote Desktop and Streamer.
B002P8O29K|4.0|The video and sound were very clear compared to the orginal VHS tape of the same video. I would recommend this video to any stones fan or anyone interested in rock and or the sixties.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|IT IS A GREAT DESIGN AND GETS THE JOB DONE SIMPLY AND COMPACTLY.<br />I've only used it a couple of times but it digs in well and sharpens knife edges very good. I use a honing steel to finish the edge. I'm far from an expert in sharpening but I am able to get a better edge with this method than any tool I have ever used.<br /><br />The size and design make it very convenient. I would recommend it.
B007R41E8O|1.0|took forever to download on my I pad.  then got one second of game then strange happenings. can't play game .
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|as an original player from back in the day I was excited to see this one redid but that excitement didn't last long.game play was good if you don't mind playing in interverals. Three days into it and hit with bug bat 150+hours wait on most stuff to respawn and energy only refilled if I have app opened. too bad, uninstalling.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|So far this has been a cool Mario type game! I'm interested to see more. I haven't had a problem with the graphics on my kindle fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This was the first app I downloaded on my Kindle Fire. I love ot and use it every day. It is a quick reference and an enjoyable read. Thank you.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like this game. Similar in vein to most Facebook games. If you enjoy Farmville or other city / town / farm building games then you'll probably enjoy The Oregon Trail: American Settlers.
B001N3HUP6|5.0|What a classic. I have seen it years ago. The second time viewing is just as good. It will be good the third time.
B0055SWM08|5.0|injoy it very much and its a great way to relax you brain.  and it passes a little bit of time
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My fingers hurt from playing so long. Great game. Can't wait for the next game to come out from them. I'm sure it'll be a hit too.
B005MQW5RI|5.0|I saw the movie before i got a 3d tv, and enjoyed the movie, but the 3d in this movie is very good. Don't miss the beginning when megamind is falling the gun floats outside the screen. This is one of the better 3d movies I've seen.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Can't wait for more from Fallen Tree Games! This is a fantastic game, a wonderful brainteaser, next to impossible to put down!
0811879542|5.0|An excellent interactive book that keeps both the reader and the child fully engaged.<br /><br />As the reader reads the directions, the child is asked to push on this dot, rub that dot, or tilt the book this way or that. As the child turns the page, a new task is requested and with a blow here or a clap there, the dots move around the page with the size or location changing.<br /><br />Watch as your child giggles with each page and color swirl.<br /><br />A very entertaining interactive book that you will enjoy going back to time and again.<br /><br />Who needs an electronic devise when you can have just as much fun interacting with pages of a book?
B007PTJOV0|5.0|If you grew up with Ninentdo, this game will definitely take you back to the good old days with Mario!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I first heard the \\"We are young \\" song on a commercial. I looked it up and found that FUN was the band that sang it. This album is great. I took a chance on buying it because of that one song. I liked the sound and the way the song was produced.  Each song is so great and offers something different. Highly recommended
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you will probably end up switching games a lot because. some games are little hard but. fun. these are fun games like air hockey buy now
B00756GKBA|2.0|I agonizingly debated whether to purchase this album or not. Madonna's last few albums were ok, but not as energetically inspiring as her first 3 break out albums. In all honesty I bought it strictly for the cover as it looked like the TRUE BLUE Madonna that I had grown to love and emulated.  I was hopeful that the music would have been the back-to-her-roots style that made her the QUEEN of pop. I was dreadfully wrong and my decision to purchase this album at $15.99 was a mistake.  First of all, at 53 it is time to put away the bra's, fishnet stockings, sensual poses and sexual moves. You just look silly now.  It not only is antiquated, but she is above that now, and though she looks incredible at 53 there is no longer a need for her to follow that formula.  Now onto the music; the one song I thought I would absolutely hate actually was the only other one that I liked. The BIRTHDAY SONG, though not a chart topper, it is fun and you can tell she enjoyed doing it and made me smile.  In turn the song I detested the most was track two, GANG BANG. Not only was it a horrible message, and profane, but it was grating on my last and final nerve. I kept saying \\"Madge, really? You are 53 you aren't 23 and you just sound ridiculous\\". The only other song that I felt was worthy was GIRL GONE WILD. That is very danceable, and included the pop-dance elements that we love her for. The rest of the album was average to poor. The heavy-style techno music does NOT match her voice. If she would get back to her roots and do a tasteful, pop-vogue-style album....it would sell.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the only downfall is it takes lots of replay of same games to earn enough coins to open new ones
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app! It really gives your photos more creativity and personality!!!! I am on the app all the time! I would definatlity recommend this app! Love!!(:

B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really enjoyed this on my kindle fire. Nice graphics and lots of levels. Great for a rainy afternoon! Please do more!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Now I can finally watch my favoritr videos without Internet! I can also listen to the music with out the Internet!
B005FQ2H8W|5.0|Escellent movie its a classic. The premise is well done and interesting. One of the best movies of the era although not well known.
B0068FYZ84|5.0|This is a great movie to watch time after time!  My little 2yr old grandson just LOVES it and constantly asks to watch it.  It was the first movie I loaded for him on my Kindle Fire, and he loved it so much, we decided to order the DVD from Amazon so he could watch it whenever he wanted.  It's a timeless classic that even the adults in the family don't get tired of seeing.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|When you see the B-17 Bomber, with a large crew in small spaces and their bravery in the face of heavy German gunfire from the ground, you get a taste of what courage it took, to defend America.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I didn't expect much from this at first, but then was pleasantly surprised when I finally tried it out. Highly recommended, already bought Reflect and can't wait to try it out!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and a little addictive too!! gotta try it and start playing. good for all ages too. my daughter &amp; I play it together
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|While I really like the game itself,  the app has a lot of glitches. Energy didn't always regenerate properly and it caused my Kindle to freeze,  forcing me to shut down and restart. Would have been great had it worked properly.
B005DC68NI|5.0|\\"Let's Get Digital\\" is a must for everyone who is considering creating and publishing their own e-books.<br /><br />Of all the many self-publishing how-tos and handbooks that are currently flooding the market, this book is definitely the best, chock full information, tips and helpful links.
0307956350|2.0|I received an Advanced Read Copy (ARC) in a Goodreads giveaway.<br /><br />I would classify this book as intriguing, rather than thrilling. I give it points for an original plot line, which adds to the intrigue but never comes up to the level of thrilling.<br /><br />The author intersperses chapters of Kate putting together the pieces of the puzzle with chapters of Kate realizing that there IS a puzzle to put together. It gives the reader insight to what's going on, insight that the character of Kate doesn't have as the story progresses. In my opinion, it has the negative effect of diffusing any tension and raises some questions - if I know these things, why doesn't a former CIA agent know them? There would have been more tension if the reader hadn't been so completely clued in as the story progressed. Even if Kate trusts Dexter implicitly, she's been trained to not trust other people, yet there clues and signals that she misses and I didn't find it believable. There's an entire subplot about Kate carrying out an unauthorized assassination in New York; it implies that Kate has something to hide, something she needs to be very careful about, even though she's no longer with the CIA. Yet, it takes her months to realize her computer has been compromised and a tracking device placed on her car, long after she suspects Bill and Julia of being something other than what they present, and even when they keep showing up everywhere she and Dexter go. And, in the end, the subplot goes nowhere, a red herring that pales to pink by the end of the book. The few moments where there could be a buildup of tension dissipate quickly and go nowhere.<br /><br />It's difficult to write a review without revealing spoilers. I feel Dexter is pretty dumb and sloppy for such a smart guy, someone who is supposed to be one of the top computer security systems experts in the world. I didn't find it believable that a computer security geek would hook up video cameras - and then not connect them toanything, especially given the magnitude of what he was doing and trying to conceal from Kate and the rest of the world. Or that a former CIA agent would find that believable and not suspect something else going on behind when the rest of the security in Dexter's office is so top notch. This wasn't the only thing I didn't believe in the story, but I can't be specific without giving away too much.<br /><br />I  found the ending unbelievable. There's no explanation as to why Julia shows up in Paris and wants to have dinner with Dexter and Kate, and I can find no logical reason for it. There's even an acknowledgment in the scene that it's awkward for everyone concerned. These two couples have nothing to say to each other any longer. They aren't friends, they never were really friends. By this time, we know that Julia and Bill's official involvement with Dexter and Kate is over - so why are they showing up again? And, by the time the final scene plays out, we also know that Julie's unofficial involvement is over - so why is she showing up again? Certainly, running into Julia again turns on a light bulb for Kate and ties up all the loose ends, but it doesn't make it logical. As I read it, I couldn't help but think that someone as smart as Julia, and with her background, would have made it a point to distance herself from Dexter and Kate.<br /><br />All in all, this book was a bit of a fizzle for me. Couple that with the price ($12.99 for the Kindle version and $17.50 for the paperback) and I'd say save your money.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Pixar never fails to produce some quality children's entertainment, that adults can enjoy.  Our story picks up a decade or so after the last movie, with Andy heading off to college.  The toys face an uncertain future, and attempt to find their place in life.  Much hardship, some great music, and new faces make up a great film.  Fun for all ages.  Mild peril, and a lot of dark philosophical overtones make this a movie that kids and adults can enjoy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I loved the original Oregon trail. This game is fun the energy level thing  sucks but it replenishes every 3 min. and as you level up.

0439023491|5.0|Just finished 'Catching Fire' the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy - I have no idea how I didnt hear of this series before... Almost every chapter in the sequel is as suspenseful as the entire first book. At the end of each chapter, which she usually ends with a mini-cliffhanger I always said, \\"Holy $#!+....\\". Im hesitant to start the third book because Im so worn out from reading through this last one and feeling stressed the entire time. Suzanne Collins is amazing ... Bravo!
B0015DROBO|5.0|incredible book. i'd heard it was good from a friend of mine, then another friend saw the movie. i have a hard time seeing movies without reading the book first so.........wow, i couldn't put it down (actually, my Kindle).

0345803485|1.0|This book was already released online as Twilight fanfiction so this version only changes the names from Edward and Bella to Christain and Ana. Besides that, the book is full of horrible writing, child molestation, and a ridiculous abusive relationship.

B001XSCRKO|5.0|Crank up your volume and prepare for an adrenlin rush in the classic war movie \\"Black Hawk Down\\". This original, superior telling of a true 'capture & extraction\\" mission - conducted by Delta and Elite Army troops - shows us what it takes to capture a Somali warlord and his entourage. It is as much battleground reality as most viewers can handle. The realism is so profound and the exchange of heavy fire between the calibers of war is so ear-deafening - that by the time we realize that we are on the ground or in the air - we are engulfed. We are in the flames of battle hell, and what perceptions we brought to this brilliant film: may now be altered forever. Our emotions, our sense of compassion and support to the troops (who protect our freedoms with their lives) - is now grounded in their heroism, sacrifice, hardship on and off the battlefield, and when one of our own falls dead in battle (KIA) - we are anything but indifferent. Our empathy is strong going in and coming out of the officer's call out to all U.S. military personnel within earshot: \\"We gotta a Black Hawk Down. We gotta a Black Hawk Down.\\" We are on the ground until we 'hike it out behind the armored trucks.' All unities adhered to. The crescendo is through the roof even though this is a true story.<br /><br />\\"Leave no man behind.\\" We go the distance with our warriors until we are safe and sound with a cup of cold water pouring down our face and into our mouth. Please see my future movie review for \\"Casualties of War\\" when it is done.<br /><br />In French<br /><br />Couder sur votre volume et préparer à une hâte d'adrenlin dans le film de guerre classique « le Faucon Noir en bas ». Cet original, ce supérieur qui dit d'un vrai < la prise & l'extraction » la mission - dirigé par Delta et les troupes d'Armée d'Elite - montre à prend nous qu'il capturer un chef militaire somalien et son entourage. C'est autant de réalité de champ de bataille comme la plupart des téléspectateurs peuvent contrler. Le réalisme est si profond et l'échange de feu lourd entre les calibre de guerre est si oreille-assourdant - qui le temps nous nous rendons compte que nous soyons par terre ou dans l'air - nous sommes englouti. Nous sommes dans les flammes d'enfer de combat, et quelles perceptions nous avons amené à ce film brillant : pourrait être maintenant changé à jamais. Nos émotions, notre sens de compassion et soutient aux troupes (qui protège nos libertés avec leurs vies) - est maintenant fondé dans leur héroïsme, leur sacrifice, leur tribulation sur et du champ de bataille, et quand un de nos propres chutes mortes dans le combat (KIA) - nous sommes n'importe quoi mais indifférent. Notre empathie est entrer robuste et sort de l'appel de l'officier hors à tout le personnel militaire américain à portée de voix : « Nous gotta un Faucon Noir en bas. Nous gotta un Faucon Noir en bas ». Nous sommes par terre jusqu'à ce que nous < le va à pied hors derrière les camions blindés >. Toutes les unités ont adhéré à. Le crescendo est par le toit bien que ceci est une vraie histoire.<br /><br />« Ne pas partir d'homme derrière ». Nous persévérons avec nos guerriers jusqu'à ce que nous sommes sain et sauf avec une tasse d'eau froide qui verse en bas notre visage et dans notre bouche.

B0041KW7MO|5.0|In Italian<br /><br />Avviarsi a manovella sul suo volume e preparare per una fretta di adrenlin nel film di guerra classico \\"Annerisce Falco Giù\\". Quest'originale, dire superiore di un vero 'la cattura & l'estrazione\\" la missione - condotto dall'Esercito di Delta ed Elite truppe di - mostra ci che porta a catturare un signore della guerra somalo ed il suo ambiente. È tanta realtà di campo di battaglia quanto la maggior parte degli spettatori possono maneggiare. Il realismo è così profondo e lo scambio di fuoco pesante tra i calibri di guerra è così orecchio-assordando - che dal tempo realizziamo che siamo a terra o nell'aria - siamo inghiottiti.

1594744769|3.0|I originally picked this book up at Sam's for around 10 dollars after seeing it on the list of \\"popular books\\" on amazon. I hadn't purchased it on my kindle since I'd heard that the pictures did not show up very well on the e-ink screen.<br />I was excited to read it, thoroughly entranced by the haunting vintage pictures included in the center of the book. They reminded me of the movie the \\"Haunting in Connecticut\\" or other horror movies where horrible things were done to patients in psych wards that made your skin crawl. (Do I have a dark sense of humor?) I got goosebumps just thinking about it.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />The book revolves around a boy named Jacob. He's doomed to a summer working at his family's convenience store until an opportunity presents itself through his grandfather's unfortunate end. Jacob had a good relationship with him; the old man had told him many fantastical stories of an orphanage he had stayed in during the Holocaust. Jacob had originally thought his stories had merely been great exaggerations from the truth, embellishments for a child's amusement. However, when he actually perceives the killer of his grandfather, Jacob is determined to find out the true story behind his grandfather's seemingly unbelievable stories. He asks his father, who agrees to travel with him to the strange island that links him to his grandfather's past.<br /><br />REVIEW:<br />I'll be honest, this book wasn't what I was expecting at all. And not in a good way, either. Perhaps I had high expectations for the book since reading so many positive reviews about it, but it just didn't settle right with me.<br />This book has a good premise. The pictures are amazing, the writing is simple to read. However, the book included a fantasy element that I didn't appreciate; it seemed out of place and forced. The beginning started off strong, getting readers prepared to face a horrid truth about the children in the orphanage or something like that. That strength later trickles off into a fantastical story about kids with magical abilities.<br />It felt like someone had dug up the old vintage pictures presented in the book and had tried to form a story around them. One thing that irked me was that some of the children were seen much more than others. For example, the twins. I'd have to say that they were the creepiest out of all the pictures. However, they were barely mentioned in the book. Perhaps this is set up for future sequels and such, but I was sad to see that they weren't mentioned more. Maybe that's just me picking at small details... But still disappointing nonetheless.<br /><br />TL;DR:<br />the good- writing was well done, simple to read; the vintage pictures were simply alluring.<br />the bad- it was too unbelievable, fantasy elements were too forced.<br />the final verdict- Maybe borrow this book from a friend or a library before you decide to fork over $20 for it. It may appeal to those who like a vintage tinge to their fantasy novels, but perhaps not so much the other way around.

0913866156|2.0|I've been a fan of the Thoth deck for 15 years now. I misplaced my original deck and ordered this was a replacement. The images are decent - though much less vibrant than the previous edition - but the production quality on this specific deck is awful. The cards are painfully thing and flimsy. They'd never hold up to regular use, especially if you shuffle the cards before a reading. It's a shame, because this is a great deck, but this low quality product places this edition in the \\"barely usable\\" category for me.
B002E66C6E|5.0|\\"U-571\\" deserves high praise for its professionalism in shaping an adventure war story with exhilarating scenes of danger, chaos, mayhem, action, and `to the final man' heroism. What separates this WWII submarine movie from other similar classics - afterall, it is a sub-genre in and of itself with \\"Das Boot\\" leading the wolfpack - is its relentless pursuit of mission objectives - despite deadly setbacks. Our Navy captain is killed. Most of the crew are blown away by a German U-boat that comes upon them suddenly and fires a torpodoe into their backside. A lieutenant (played with power and nerve by Matthew McConaughey), his Chief (played with exactness by Harvey Keitel), and other navy seaman-commandoes hold our attention and keep the fire burning along that HOT crescendo-tension line. \\"Take it down!\\" waves the dying captain as he sinks below the surface of the ocean deep. His last words are a direct order that sets in motion our sacred Acts II and III and our first sudden plot reversal. That chilling, gut-level plotline elevates U-571 into the Classic ranks for future generations.<br /><br />All actors portray their roles with a sense of natural realism in the rugged, death-defying reality of battling enemy frigates and submarines, including Bill Paxton, David Keith, Thomas Kretschmann, Jon Bon Jovi, Jack Noseworthy, Will Estes, and Tom Guiry. We come away (I believe) from this particular movie with a stoic understanding of what our history books tell us in words: but now we have lived it in this high-end production. Of course, your `best warrior dramas' drop you into the battle and leave you there to fight it out 'tooth & nail' until all or some of us are vanquished. It is satisfying. It demands all can be done by those of us who identify with our fellow warriors up on that screen; given the hard duty at sea after so many are killed or wounded. What do you do next? You can't quit. You make due.<br /><br />You rise to the occasion. You conduct battle and go into whatever you face with courage and fortitude, with whatever weapons you can lay your hands on. Welcome to dead-on combat. That is the beauty of U-571. It grips you right away. It is a heroic type war film. You are plunged into all manner of deadly fighting. When it is over, you have earned your stripes as a seaman. You have been put to the test. All unities adhered to. Empathy and catharsis run `hot and straight', like torpedoes fired with precision from a submarine. Superior story & direction by Jonathan Mostow, screenplay by Sam Montgomery and David Ayer, editing by Wayne Wahrman, cinematography by Oliver Wood, and a soundtrack work by Richard Marvin. Can only hope that Mostow and his crew make another great war movie.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is really fun and addicting. You don't have to wait long for crops or money. Would suggest this for anyone.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|My son and I went to see this movie in 3-D at a theater in Eau Claire, meeting in the food court prior to going into the theater. It was a very enjoyable movie full of action and the 3-D effects were good though perhaps not the finest I have seen. The special effects in the movie were superb, the storyline was exciting and all in all it was one great movie.<br />Sadly, the night after viewing the movie my son passed away so after 35 years of going together to see movies, a tradition we kept alive since before he was 2 years of age, it will be the last movie we will enjoy seeing together. Im just glad that it was a really good one that both of us enjoyed immensely.<br />So, from before the movie \\"The Scanners\\" was released, a tradition has passed. I only hope that wherever my son is that he gets to enjoy watching action packed movies just like the literally hundreds we saw together on this mortal coil.<br />I highly recommend this movie to any and everyone. Especially to those of you who actually read the books featuring John Carter. Ya don't have to see it in 3-D, the movie would stand alone in traditional format very easily as the action packed, special effect filled film that it is. I am going to pre-order a blu ray copy for more reasons than simply wanting to own a great, very fun movie to watch. I will also order it out of the memory of my best friend, a son I thought of more as a brother than my child, and simply one heck of a great guy that a lot of people will miss...like just about everyone who had the pleasure to have met him.<br />But for those of you just looking for a great movie to buy and watch, I highly recommend this movie. And also, go to the library and read the book series. They remain as great reading despite it being over a hundred years since they were penned.<br />GREAT MOVIE!!

B005Q1W0ZQ|4.0|After watching Season 1 of this show, I couldn't wait to dive into Season 2.  I'm happy to report the sophomore season continues the same high level of storytelling as featured in its freshman year...  for the most part.  A few storylines push the limits of credibility, but we all know this show is really just a glossy soap, right?<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT! This season, we get the old cliche about a stranger with amnesia stirring up trouble for the family when he claims to be a long-thought dead relative; we get the old cliche about a wounded, impotent soldier pushing away his sweatheart right before he miraculously recovers; and we get a surprise illness that neatly wraps up several storylines in time for a happy ending.  END SPOILERS.<br /><br />Cliched storylines aside, most of the time the show manages to avoid becoming the victim of melodrama.  Despite little misteps such as two characters suddenly \\"sensing\\" two other characters' fates from miles away, I still found myself caring about the lives of the Crawleys and their servants.  I can't wait to see what happens to them in Season 3! Fortunately, this season is two episodes longer than Season 1, but I wish it were much longer than 9 episodes.  (What happened to the days when shows averaged 22 episodes per season? Sigh.)<br /><br />The fact that this set has 9 episodes means it does indeed contain \\"Christmas at Downton Abbey.\\" This isn't a one-of-a-kind special episode; it's a continuation of plotlines and definitely needs to be seen to learn the full story.  Even though this set is put out by PBS, it's my understanding this is the unedited version of the show--the way it aired in the UK--not the version that was broadcast on PBS stations in the States (hence, the label \\"Original UK Edition\\" on the cover).  I may be wrong, but after reading others' comments on Amazon, that was the conclusion I came to.  The episodes vary in length from 53 minutes long to 1 hour 34 minutes long, which is another clue that they're unedited.<br /><br />My gripes about this product are the same ones I had for the Season 1 set put out by PBS, so I'm going to repeat them here...<br /><br />Because I'm reviewing the product and not just the show itself, it wouldn't be fair to ignore the blu-ray set's shortcomings.  My first gripe deals with technical issues: the set should have been released with 1080p resolution and 5.1 lossless audio.  After all, it's 2012 and we're talking blu-ray, not DVD.  I know there's a UK set that has 1080p resolution, but there seems to be some question as to whether or not it will play on American blu-ray players (which is why I went with this set instead).  The difference in resolution is subtle to some, but the difference becomes more obvious on bigger screens.  That's not to say the 1080i presentation is bad because it's certainly better than DVD quality.  I just know I would have appreciated the highher resolution on my 120\\" screen.<br /><br />As far as the audio goes, this set definitely would have benefited from surround sound.  Instead, it comes with a 2.0 DTS-HD MA track.  (At least that's what my PS3 says it is.  The back cover simply says Stereo.) When my receiver tries to create a surround experience using DTS Neo:6 Cinema mode, the dialog in the center speaker is not as clear as it could have been with a dedicated front channel, and there's little bass effect coming from the subwoofer.  That lack of punch is sorely missed during the many battle scenes depicted this season.<br /><br />My second gripe is the lack of an episode guide in this set.  There's isn't one on screen nor is there a printed version included in the case.  The disc labels don't even specify which episodes are on which discs.  It's not until you load each disc that you discover which episodes are on it.  There are only 3 discs, but I find this inexcusable when plenty of other studios release TV seasons with some method of tracking episodes.  For instance, the Season Play feature on the \\"Lost\\" blu-rays is an excellent way to keep track of your progress, especially if it's been some time since you've watched the show.  The on-screen menus on these discs, however, don't do much to help the viewer recall which episode they left off on: each episode is simply titled \\"Part 1,\\" \\"Part 2,\\" etc., except for \\"Christmas at Downton Abbey,\\" offering no hint as to what each episode is about; nor is there a synopsis of each episode that viewers can read before playing an episode.<br /><br />Like Season 1, the quality of the show itself overshadows the blu-ray's shortcomings, so don't let them stop you from getting this set, especially if you enjoyed Season 1.  The sudsy fun continues.  Bring on Season 3! Highly recommended.ost\\" blu-rays is an excellent way to keep track of your progress, especially if it's been some time since you've watched the show.

B006ISJQ1W|5.0|When this movie came out, everyone read the names \\"Hunter S Thompson\\" and \\"Johnny Depp\\" and immediately expected a wild fun adventure such as \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\". Well, it isn't. It is a better movie. Though it is cruel to compare the two movies, both brilliant in their own genres, this one is a better mainstream cinema.<br /><br />The movie begins with the protagonist played by Depp waking up with a hangover in Puerto Rico hotel. He is there for a job as a journalist and he is late. He is habitually late throughout the movie which could be taken as a metaphor in its own way. The decadence of a nation, while the rich get richer and tear down more truths to establish a mafia of real estate barons.<br /><br />Depp's character is brilliant as always. Like all his films he brings a lot to this one too. Makes the character living breathing personality that will make you stand and cheer. He is in a new job in an old newspaper which seems to be on the verge of going out of business. Depp meets interesting people. The photographer and the crime reporter are brilliantly played by talented actors. The whole atmosphere of dread and celebration is there for you to witness. Dread and desperation for many poverty stricken bitter people. Celebrations for a handful of rich elite. Enter Eckhart as the big player making things possible for his criminal associates. He wants to hire Depp's skills. Helps out Depp when he is in trouble. Depp follows the events as if in a daze. He just goes with the flow. Even falls hard for Eckhart's girl. Yet he is a gentleman throughout. He single-handedly keeps the flame of righteous journalism burning. Alas, no one gives a damn.<br /><br />The movie is a lot closer to the chaos of \\"The Tailor of Panama\\" than to Depp's previous turn as a junkie journalist in \\"Fear and Loathing...\\", and you have to enjoy the story rather than compare things with Hunter S Thompson's original works.<br /><br />Apart from the leading cast, the best thing to look forward to is the music by Christopher Young. If you bought this DVD and liked it, I am sure you will be tempted to go out and buy the Original Sound Track of this motion picture too.<br /><br />There is not a single dull moment in the lives of these mesmerising characters. The rum, the locals, the beatup car, the woman, the job, the jail, the parties, the cockfights, the drunken dialogue, the entire set and visuals, it is all a thrill to watch.<br /><br />Keep an open mind and beware not to compare it to other movies/books and you will surely enjoy this product. An immensely satisfying story and magnificently crafted movie. Johnny Depp proves yet again, he is in a class of his own.

It's one of my 3 favorite TV series (Tudors, Rome, Game of Thrones). So far my favorite but Game of Thrones is getting close.<br /><br />I kind of wished Max Perkis stayed on as Gaius Octavian instead of Simon Woods. Max was interesting from the get-go, and I don't see a convincing resemblance between them. Still both were good and the rest of the cast was splendid. Yea for Kevin McKidd finally getting a starring high profile role and doing it perfectly. A classic.

0345803485|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is the worst book I have ever read.  Sadly, this book is being reference to similarities of the Twlight Series, but it end of being a pornographic psycho novel, basically saving someone with controlling sexual issues.  I would not recommend for anyone to read.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|If they were charging any money for it, I'd be disgusted by how much this game blatantly rips of Super Mario Brothers but at least it's free. I don't like how Feint is included on here but at least it let's you continue without forcing you to sign up. The game itself was ok, you run and jump and throw pinecones and try to reach the end. Lep controls are a little floaty and remind me the flash games I played as a kid. All in all, it's fun for a while but I still would prefer dedicated buttons over onscreen controls.
B0037TPMOA|5.0|This is the first book i have read, that was written by Stephen King. I have to say I was not disappointed, the book gave me something that most horror movies lack these days. A sense of love for each character and a sense of fear. We see the pain and rip in the family, and we feel for Jack even when he has gone insane. The scenes with Danny were creepy, I member having to turn the light on after reading this. While we never truly learn of why the hotel is so evil we do get enough information to feel happy with the ending.All in all i recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of horror.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|really dissapointed! angry about only 2 games when l pad have 6!  felt like I was punished for having a kindle instead of expensive I pad........
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Muy buena edicion. La calidad de imagen y sonido es excellente. Esta muy bien presentada y con varias opciones de subtitulos. Realmente una excelente edicion a un muy buen precio.
0140120416|5.0|This grammar book is used by myself, my wife, and a group of about 20 other friends of ours who are studying the russian language.  It gives a thorough explanation of grammar in a method that makes it easier to retain.  Highly recommended!!!
B00757J98K|5.0|This album is brilliant. Very dancey/electronica and reminiscent of the Confessions album. I can't wait to see her on tour this year!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its an over all good game,  a lot of variety. I'm not a fan of the point system it uses.
B00006RCNW|5.0|THis was a great TV show. And just sucked you in..<br />I have this set and all the way up to season 4.<br />Sold them all. And got the Complete Box set...<br />Watch it, and get sucked in..<br />A must see and have...
B003Y5HWMW|1.0|Theses blu ray discs will not play, and they freeze my blu ray player. I returned to Amazon and received a replacement. The result was the same. I will be returning this yet again for a refund. Disappointed because I was looking forward to watching this show in hi def. Yes, my player is new, and updated to latest firmware.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This is a must have. Start from season one. And watch as Walt and Jesse blow you away.<br />One of the best TV dramas of all time. And thought provoking<br />When 95% of the stuff on TV now is total trash. This is one show that is 100% the best of the best!<br />And it has Closed Caption for the Hard Of Hearing..<br /><br />A total must have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|FOREWARNING:  Once you read this book, you will find yourself constantly referring to it in your conversations with friends and colleagues.  You might even email relatives recommending this book to them to help with raising their children or to change their habits.  As you may imagine, all of this communication from you may not necessarily be welcomed.  Stop and consider if you want to learn something so life changing that you cannot help but share it with others.  If you are not interested in change, I recommend you avoid this book.<br /><br />(If you do buy it, I recommend reading the Appendix immediately following the first section on personal habits.  The Appendix has the \\"how to's\\" in it, and I suspect that is the reason most folks will read this book:  to change their personal habits.  Part 2 deals with habits in your organizations, and Part 3 is habits in our culture.  I found those interesting; my husband did not.)
B004JZBGWI|5.0|i am in love with this app! whether it is simple reminders or what i see and hear... this app is the app for me. best notepad app ever.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was a fun book to read.  It did not take to long to read because it was pretty fast paced.  If you are looking for an easy read choose this book.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this app was a waste of my time. first of all..... it takes 4ever to load. plus.. it kept force closing... and when i got it to work and load... it froze my kindle and it didnt unlock till 3 days were over
B004SBQGHS|1.0|get the free version. it has all the same levels but with the ads that rarely bother me and if u turn off the wifi, theyre r no ads.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|the dev team needs to stop commenting on.their own.stuff! this one.guy has written the same thing 1000 times so that he can.get as close to 5 stars as possible<br /><br />embarrassed I even considered installing<br /><br />should be removed for bad dev behavior
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is pretty fun. Creating your own restaurant design and the bits of socializing with others is fun. Of course you should have the common sense to know that countless of apps try their best to gain money and children will easily compile their wishes so be mindfull of that.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it just wrote the revew for the points so many games hope I can unlock all of them smiley face :)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I liked the game.  its like Mario.. no glitches works great on kindle fire.good free game.good game to play while havein to wait to get into an appointment.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|Really a great movie, very good story, actor and specially Zoe Saldana is a must. I hope there will be The Loser 2......
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I loved playing this game it was really fun and adventerous. I liked to play it and so did my friends it was a really. interesting game.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|AB space just took all the other apps, got them in a headlock, and shook them around until they didn't sworn any more. So AB space basically taped the app store.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|Since I was a child, this book has been dear to me. It taught me morals and values that I still hold close today. But what morals would that be? It certainly didn't teach me to think that all new military technology is evil, that religion is all lies, or even that all \\"midgets are, after all, diversions for silly or quiet times.\\"<br /><br />I love this book because it reminds us that one of humanity's greatest gifts is an ability to create new things out of nothing, and at the same time it warns us that unbridled arrogance in this creation - lying, approximating, assuming we can predict everything - is a danger which should always be kept in the back of our minds.<br /><br />Vonnegut disapproved of the atom bomb and all of the new, despicable, creative technologies that Cold War scientists were developing. MADD made him mad because he believed the theory was quite mad in itself. I don't share these beliefs, but I certainly agree that worrying about nuclear destruction, chemical weapons, and biological agents is vital to the health of the modern world. Worrying about these things is what makes us human; it is what keeps the world sane in the advent of nuclear weapons. Vonnegut's book definitely taught me to be wary of consequences, averse to arrogance, and suspicious of others' creations. These things are in the back of the minds of any one who has read this book and as these people create for themselves, this story's morals will stick with them. That is the brilliance of this book. I think it has served its purpose.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read the book after the movie came out and wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I wasn't dissapointed could'nt put it down. Now I'm on the second book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This card game is easy to play on a mobile device.  The ads are usually not to invasive except when they include video.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is an exciting page turner!!  It was my favorite of the series.  All I wanted to do was keep reading.  My 14 yr old daughter who is not an avid reader can't put it down.  She's reading rather than watching tv!!  Thanks Suzanne Collins for a wonderful book with no curse words that all ages can enjoy!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is different from what I played as a child-but fun! lots of new challenges pop up all of the time.
B0055SWM08|5.0|if you like this game be sure to get quell reflect it has more puzzles and imo is slightly better than this game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its not too too easy but definitely not hard. it passes the time when you have nothing else to do.
B0068FYZ3Y|4.0|As far as combo packs go, this one really appealed to me because it was so reasonably priced. That said, earlier reviews of the combo pack stated that there were issues with the digital copy. However, I am happy to report that it appears that this issue has been resolved and I had no problem redeeming my code. This is a must have for any Tarantino fan!
B0055SWM08|5.0|There are no silly gimmicks with this app.  It's a simple idea that's executed with an elegance and grace not often seen in mobile games.  Fantastic job Fallen Tree, you deserve the praise.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i love how this game is so fun and addictive. i love how you have to jump on the blocks and get the gold coins!!!!!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|loved it on the ipad. glad I can use it on the fire now. easy to control and addictive like farmville. no glitches or freeze issues.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|The blu-ray version of this release is by far the better choice than this standard dvd. However getting an audio cd of the music from this tour is a great addition to my collection.
B004YXE438|5.0|This app is so awesome. I use it all the time for my Kindle Fire. The puzzles are bright and fun, controls are easy, and gameplay is smooth. Has kept me entertained for hours! Worth the price, and then some. Absolutely wonderful app. One single complaint, however: since updating, I'm unable to play my own custom picture. Otherwise, this app is flawless.
B0064SHI9I|5.0|Used MyBackup Pro app to backup all my other phone apps I had on my Droid X2 before transferring to a replacement Droid X2 phone. Simple load to the memory card, reloaded MyBackup Pro to the replacement phone from the website and transferred all my apps right back on to the new phone. Simple and painless, much better than repurchasing or reloading all the apps again. All your apps and information can be backed up to a secure area and reloaded at anytime.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This Star Trek is the best re-adaptation of an original series to date.  The selection of the new cast is incisive.  The chemistry is best even surpassing the original in some instances.  This is not the Star Trek of Old or the Star Trek of the Next Generation, but the Star Trek of the New Generation.  Most impressive indeed.  The only thing I fault the developers, investors, and the creators is that they did not plan for an immediate or mid-term (2-3 year) new show, with the exact same cast, for a new series...aka, Star Trek the New Generation.  So much time has been lost...and with it, new revenue streams.<br /><br />This movie is awesome.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I have used the Shazam music app for several months now and I am very pleased with it abilities. Have used it numerous times to find an artist or information about a song that is playing and have only had one occasion that it did not recognize the song. It shows album information, lyrics and purchase information. A very good app.
0811879542|5.0|I bought this book for my five year old son and absolutely loved it.  He was engaged throughout the entire reading, and his reaction to what happened each time we turned the page was priceless.  I brought it to my preschool classroom to read aloud to the children and allowed everyone to get a turn.  I have never seen their eyes light up for a book as much as they did that day!  I plan to read it to every class I have, such a great book.
0545265355|5.0|If you haven't heard of these books you mist be living under a rock, because there has been so much hype about the movies. I bought these books because I had some long flights with long layovers and wanted something to keep me occupied (on hindsight carrying 3 hardcover books around wasn't the brightest idea, but it was worth it). Well I hardly slept because these books are so incredible. I loved them so much that I actually finished and immediately reread them. The hardcover books are beautiful, especially if you love having a shelf full of books like I do. I know a few people who didn't like the conclusion, including myself the first time around, but if you reread the third book (or all of them!) I think it makes more sense and you will realize it's actually a very good ending.
B0013FSVES|2.0|This is recorded Traviata with Scotto and Kraus, two of the singers I have heard most often in theatre. I have not seen the complete cast list, however it is rumoured that the role of Flora's servant, who invites parfty goers into dinner with the words 'la cena e pronta' is sung by the tenor Giuseppe di Stefano. Is this true?
B0072GPQNG|3.0|I was expecting a better film.  Not bad, and the filming was very good, but I thought the main plot was a bit weak,(without giving it away if you've  not seen it yet). My wife really liked it, but the trailer was better than the actual movie. If you like horse movies, you will probably like it but don't get your hopes up too much.  As I said, the filming however was very good. For people who like horse movies, Seabiscuit and Dreamer were better in my opinion.  Was too reminicient of Black Beauty, if you know the story.  worth watching, but not great.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Excellent game. very simple and easy to jump into. Puzzles progress in difficulty but<br />they remain fun. Well worth the purchase
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun to just sit around and play to kill time here and there. get stuck once in a while but it wouldn't be fun if every game was easy
B0050VJ29Y|5.0|This album was my first foray into Danger Mouse, and I absolutely love it.  The more times I have listened, the more addicted I get.  The sounds are just perfect.  Norah Jones and Jack White are so well places with the music.  Best album purchase in YEARS!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Energy level is too small that each time you play its only for a few minutes and the whole game went haywire when each item's time to produce money or food went from normal (a few minutes to a few hours) to literally 180 hours.
B003Y5H5B0|2.0|Could have been a good movie was really funny but all the swearing really distracted from the funny. Then them swearing in a church like that was extremely disrespectful. They really need to stop making movies with all the language I'm 21 and and almost walked our of the there on this movie the language was so bad.if you have  no problem at all with hearing the fbomb literally every other word this movie might be funny for you. But if you are bothered at all by language even just a little I don't recommend this one.I don't understand why they have to put so much sex and language in movies even kids movies now all have at least one swear word it's rediculous I hate it.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I am a new fan of Adele. She has an incredible voice and presence! I am getting a little tired of all the renditions of \\"Rolling in the deep\\" though.
B007FZVWFA|4.0|I just wanted to chime in myself after reading several one-star reviews. The overall concept of the movie is nothing new: aliens invading planet to take over. Even with that however, the aliens themselves and the location being set in Moscow separated this title from the rest. The actors were all fresh faces, adding to the \\"realism\\" for lack of a better term. Their performances were surprisingly good despite what some reviews have indicated.<br /><br />To summarize, it's definitely worth the hour and a half of your life that you'll spend watching it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I like puzzle games that make you think so this one is a real winner for me.  I have it on my Kindle Fire. and it works very well.
0316056871|5.0|This book was hilarious. Certain lines I will remember forever (speaking about her biker shorts outfit complete with fanny pack circa 1991: \\"I was nailing it on a daily basis!\\"), and certain descriptions won't leave my brain (such as one about the smell of infant formula). I don't watch 30 Rock but I loved her news updates and skits on SNL. A friend recommended this to me and now my mom is reading it!
B007PTJOV0|1.0|its just a rip off of Mario and it gets really boring really fast. don't waste your time by getting this app.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I think that this app is fun if you like a mind challenge. but I don't like how they have games that you cant win it can be very frustrating. other than that I like the game. its harder than spider solitaire that I'm use to
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I enjoy simple games so this was pretty fun would recommend. I had fun so I assume many others will also.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|One of the best games ever! Exactly like Mario Bros. Finally they made a good app for once. I recommend this app!
B006AZZPCM|3.0|idk what it is but not everything I want is on here. I searched. for stuff but just cant seem to find what I want.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This is a very interesting app but I liked it. Especially the leprachaun. I thouht he was pretty cool looking.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found out about this book on Good Morning America.  I did not realize that it was XXXXXXX rated.  I order the three books for my kindle, but i am disappointed...
B005IZLPKQ|2.0|To be perfectly honest I was expecting more. The action sequences were alright, but there was a total of literally maybe 10 minutes of action in the whole movie. I'm glad I only rented it for $1 at Redbox...
B004GJYROG|5.0|i  really love this movie and it brought back good memories. it shipped pretty quick and it was at a great price.
B002I0J5FG|4.0|I have been wanting to play ICO since it came out and I missed out on the PS2 generation. I was able to try it out at a friend's house a few weeks ago, but the picture quality was horrible (wouldn't work with the PS2 component cable), but I could see the potential. So when I picked up this PS3 HD version, it looked absolutely amazing in comparison. That said, I'll review these separately.<br /><br />ICO: 3/5. Beautiful game and enjoyable. Controls & camera are frustrating. A couple parts are very frustrating due to controls: bounce puzzle and water wheel. Google it for info on how to control those two properly. I think this game is important from a game design point of view. The music suits it well. I think it's a must-play, despite the control/camera issues. But you need to be in the right mood to enjoy it. I was. It's short and the right length.<br /><br />SHADOW OF THE COLOSSUS: 4.7/5 This one met my expectations and maybe exceeded them a little. Absolutely beautiful game and very cool puzzles & action. The colossi are just jaw-dropping for a PS2 game. I normally buy a game and end up selling it right after beating it, but I'm contemplating keeping this one. I can definitely see myself going back to play it. The music is fantastic as well. Some of it reminds me of King Crimson (first record, Court). Still has some controls/camera issues, but not nearly as bad as ICO and only slightly interferes with gameplay. A must-play game for sure, and is tempting me to go back to play on hard mode because of the way they set up that mode. It's just the right length for this type of game and for replay value. Any added \\"collecting\\" and stuff would have hampered the experience. This is really close to a perfect game IMO.<br /><br />I highly recommend you pick these up if you're into action/adventure games.
0792833201|5.0|You know how many YEARS I've been wanting to watch the original Poltergeist?  More than 10, that's for sure.  I just don't understand why it took this long to finally be able to watch it.  Oh sure, I could have bought the DVD on amazon but the price has always been really high (perhaps because people realize how much of a classic it is?)  The rating scores here on amazon are MIGHTY impressive, and I'm about to give it its 200 5-star rating.<br /><br />My expectations were INSANELY high last night.  Every horror buff I've ever known raves about the original Poltergeist.  Knowing how much I love films such as the Amityville Horror and the Exorcist, I simply could NOT go wrong.  Talk about searching for the gold at the end of the rainbow and not even having to BE near the rainbow- this movie was destined to be in my top 5 horror classics of all-time, no doubt about it.<br /><br />Anyway, what makes the movie so good?  Or rather, what makes it so scary?  Well for those of you who happen to be in the same category as me and never got a chance to see it, you probably already know a few things.  One, the blonde-haired little girl has an obsession starring at the static on TV screens late at night after the Star-Spangled Banner is over, and two, something evil is lurking inside the home.  Just what it IS that's lurking however, is where the suspense comes in.  These are definitely things *I* knew before going in last night.  Now however, I know a whole lot more, haha.  I realize these things were just the tip of the iceberg.  There's actually a REALLY compelling and frightening story taking place here and even more amazingly, this movie takes the atmosphere and the jump scares that *would* seem cheap in other films, and uses them fantastically and right at home here.<br /><br />Alright, where to start.  How about the kitchen scene with the chairs?  I won't be giving it away but something extraordinary happens here even though nowadays it's a recurring theme in scary moviesand stories.  I imagine back in 1982 people were totally shocked and on the edge of their seats over such a segment.  I actually didn't see it coming.  Proof that a subtle camera view and a quiet and unpredictable scene can really produce amazing results.<br /><br />Now the BEST part of this movie has to be shortly after the halfway point when after its finally been proven that a poltergeist is living in this house, everyone is awake in the middle of the night and whispering and carrying conversations with each other over the fear that they're experiencing.  This is when the investigation team comes into the home and becomes friends with the family.  This is what I mean when I say the story is compelling.  This particular type of segment when people are discussing their fear and how to handle the presence of a poltergeist (and having plenty of time devoted to it) is what *makes* a horror movie exciting to me.<br /><br />This segment is a good 15 minutes long and it never feels overlong or overdone, and proves that time devotion is the key to success.  I was actually waiting for something loud, menacing and terrifying to suddenly happen amongst all the whispering and quiet atmosphere but... what happens isn't QUITE what you're probably thinking as a viewer, but... without spoiling it, the glow at the top of the stairs leading to an unusual circumstance that wasn't presented by the naked eye until AFTER the poltergeist crew went over the tapes is what strikes me as the most fasciating part of this segment.  Heck, just the fact that whatever was lurking upstairs in the kids bedroom decided to make its presence known to the family and ghost hunting team downstairs in the middle of the night is terrifying enough.<br /><br />What's interesting is that the blonde-haired little girl that's become synonymous with the Poltergeist series actually becomes TRAPPED behind the walls of the house when her obsession with communicating with the demons through the static-y televisionscreens finally becomes too much and sucks her in.  Another highlight is the presence of Zelda Rubinstein, the creepiest woman to EVER set foot in a horror film.  Back in the 80's she was downright awesome.  Nobody was better at delivering their creepy lines than Zelda.  Her presence ALONE makes the movie that much more chilling.  She does a spectacular job telling the story here and why the blonde-haired girl is stuck in the other dimension.  If Zelda's scary face doesn't frighten you, surely her high-pitched speaking voice and her eerie, slow-walking demeanor will.<br /><br />Of course the movie isn't without some faults.  The tree that comes alive and blasts its branches through the bedroom window and hogs up the little brother almost had me laughing because of how ridiculous the trees behavior was, and you know, I really don't KNOW what to think about the ending when the house folds up and destroys itself.  A part me of was thinking \\"The family escaped just in time!\\" but another part of me thinks \\"Wow, that was totally the creepiest thing I've ever seen- what if MY house ever did that?\\" and whenever the father would come home and get frightened when he sees lights constantly flickering through the windows, these were *awesome* and tense moments that reminded me of the Amityville Horror.  I didn't even know what to think about the swimming pool/floating bodies segments (which is more like a mud pit than a pool) until I watched the beginning of Poltergeist 2- NOW that scene seems really good to me.<br /><br />I could just keep going on and on about the many fears that were highlights.  How about the peacefulness of the bedroom closet, giving an almost heavenly setting, trying to suck the kids into the other dimension?  It made it seem like the kids would be curious enough and willing to go just because of how beautiful it was.  THAT'S truly the sign of something evil- not just being able to fool kids, but doing so with what confusingly appears to be by God's hands.  Oh, and whenever the mother got an itch to attempt to open the bedroom door even though the evil presence was denying her to enter?  Yeah, GREAT atmosphere and tension once again.<br /><br />I just have zero complaints about this movie.  A proper amount of time was spent building to a well-told horror classic.  That's all I can say.  Worth owning indeed, even if you do have to spend a little more than usual.  It's totally worth it.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend quite a while ago, I was quite apprehensive to give it a go at first. A collection of personal accounts of survivors of a world wide zombie epidemic didn't really appeal to me at all. Eventually, after much persuasion i purchased the book and read the entire thing in one sitting, I literally couldn't put it down. Although each interview with the survivors are only quite short, the entire big picture of the plot fits together beautifully. World War Z is a brilliant take on the otherwise cliché Zombie franchise, it focus' on the human side of the story in a very original manor. Even if, like me, Zombies don't appeal to you, don't think this book is not for you. It is so much more than a Zombie thriller, and highly recommend it to anyone.
0439023513|4.0|I found this book to be the most interesting of the triology.  Here the author truly creates her science fiction world, as the rebellion is in full strength with Katniss as the mascot and symbol--the Mockingjay.<br /><br />In this book, the author has the ability to demonstrate her message for the series.  Without participation in democracy, we could easily slip into a totalian state.  How to control the masses?  Same as in ancient Rome-Panem and Circenses-bread and circuses.  In exchange for full bellies and entertainment, people will give up their power.<br /><br />Disappointing for me was the  amount of drugs given to pacify and stupify the characters.  To me it seemed that Katniss spends the end of the book in a drug induced stupor, which was disturbing considering it is a young adult book and prescription drug abuse is rampant.  Also, instead of character development, they seemed to breakdown at the end.  The ending was abrupt but not disappointing.<br /><br />With the exception of the ending, I did found the series to be different and quite interesting.  The author is giving a message for readers today through her post- apocalyptic world.  Be a part of, and fight for, the democratic process--it could easily slip through your fingers.
0553386794|1.0|This book ( paperback edition) is 807 pages long, not including the appendix or preview of the next book.  The print is too small.  There are 46 lines per page with 55 characters per line.  This is a huge book! I could not hold the book open with my injured hand.  There are far too many different names of people and places.  These are not oommon names like Bill and George but Daenerys and Illyrio.<br /><br />This book is fantasy.  But there are 4 deaths in the first 20 pages, including one man who is beheaded.  I prefer my fantasy a little more upbeat.<br /><br />This book may be the best fantasy book published this decade but I could not get past the physical \\"thing\\" that is the book to discover that for myself.
0439023491|4.0|In the second book of the Hunger Games trilogy, Katniss and Peeta are living with Haymitch in the Victors Village.  They are wealthy now, yet like Haymitch, are they happy?<br /><br />A visit from President Snow alerts Katniss and her family to the fact that the viewers of the Hunger Games considered her to be a symbol of the rebellion.  Who would have thought that giving Rue a funeral, or attempting to eat poison berries rather than kill Petta, would be construed by the audience as defiance and rebellion against the Capital?<br /><br />As the story unfolds, rebellion begins to grow in all the districts.  In order to quell the opposition, and to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of Panem, the Quarter Quell is announced.  All Victors will participate in the reaping and be participants in the Quarter Quell games.<br /><br />Catching Fire focuses on the politics and the rebellion which I found very interesting and appealing.  The author has created a world where people, tired of oppression, begin to fight back.  During the games, the characters form alliances and work together, which is rebellion in itself.  I  personally do not believe that Katniss grew as a character as much as she could have.  She is self absorbed and annoying at times.  Still, she is just 17 and who isn't self absorbed at 17?  Overall, I found the book to be an exciting page turner and very enjoyable.  Don't miss it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I made the mistake of reading reviews before I read the book, and I almost didn't read the third book, thinking Katniss was going to end up pathetic and weak. I disagree with that sentiment from some of the other reviewers. The author did an excellent job balancing what Katniss was trying to accomplish and the damage that has haunted Katniss since the day her father died. Katniss is not weak, not pathetic and not disappointing- not if you expect her to be a believable human being. No person, especially not a 17 year old girl, can enter an arena and fight to the death- twice- unscathed. The death of Rue could have easily been her undoing and she continues on fighting and trying to survive through yet another hunger games, an experience she never thought she would have to live through like that again. This book has Katniss fighting not one but two other battles- fighting for freedom and fighting for her sanity. I don't think the author did Katniss a disservice by making her flawed, by fleshing out the PTSD. I think it would have been unrealistic for Katniss to be this uber strong warrior, cold, calculating and unemotional. The readers of this series didn't fall in love with an unemotional warrior, we fell in love with a compassionate survivor with a rebellious streak. She never loses that in this book. She just has more psychological battles to fight through to get there. The epilogue is a little much, it's not exactly a happily ever after, but after all they went through, it isn't exactly keeping with the same tone as the rest of the book and it is out of place. At least you don't leave the series completely heartbroken for the main characters, which you might have done if that epilogue wasn't there.

B004EPZ00C|5.0|Funny as the day is long. I wish I had all of his films he is a real goober but I like him. I just think if Peter Sellers was still alive, they could have a film fest with Johnny English and the Pink Panther. I would give my left arm for that one.

B0055SWM08|4.0|I play this game with my 3 year old. She gets the concept of the game and gets mad at me when I pop the rain drop. It is a lot of fun.
B00753MBHA|5.0|Can't argue with four and five star reviews. I agree with all of them. Awesome metal album. Enough said!!!! BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!

B007SYWFRM|1.0|I just downloaded this app onto my Kindle Fire as I have my two young grandsons visiting. However it immediately froze up my Kindle and I had to shut it off and then back on to free things up. Now I have two little boys wth very long faces.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is actually a really fun game. It would be batter if it didn't cost so many of your coins to open up new games.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|This is the second book of the Clifton Chronicles so to follow the characters and storyline you really do need to read the first 'Only Time Will Tell'. I really enjoyed both books and can not wait for the third!
B006GECE9Y|4.0|Works great just cannot download any add ons<br />for some reason. Not sure why though. But like it better than the stock browser.
B003O86MY8|5.0|This crossover album is a brilliant mix of beautiful classical music and some of the best rock music in history.  David Garrett has with his fantastic talent on the violin created music that will appeal to any age and gender. I am blown away with David's skill and performance.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use and nice bit of graphics at the end when you win.  Thanks for developing and releasing this .
B005CM9DX6|5.0|I had not ever heard of Opeth until the Mastodon/Opeth tour was announced. I have listened to older Opeth and it is incredible music. Yet this new \\"Heritage\\" release blows me away much more. Sophisticated, hearfelt music that has you thinking old school prog but also with a fresh new sound. I feel so excited to discover this \\"new\\" band and have been spreading the word about it. Having not known the band before this a cannot say why so many look down at this record. The only thing I can say is bands grow up and you must be willing to evolve with them. If not go on with your life without Opeth. I cannot see them going back from here, nor would I want to...get this album...
B003E47HL4|4.0|I'm a mature, fussy modeler. The only kit maker I liked was Tamiya. Their fit quality, instructions, decals, all first rate. Now I've found another maker that lives up to my high expectations: Revell of Germany. NOT the US Revell, whose kits are way inferior. But this kit, for instance, is first class. The details are really crisp, and everything fits. I'm halfway into this model, and I am delighted.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Just blew through this.  Well deserving of it's Hugo nomination, which is where I came across it.  Get it - it's really good.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Kindle Fire : No longer able to just watch/stream you tube videos, must download into device to view.<br />Had to get rid of app., need upgrade to fix 'selective' downloading.
B001FB55I0|1.0|This is not acceptable. Why am I not in this movie. You cannot self terminate, but you will all be terminated.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game highly reccomended! even better because it is free! works great on the kindle fire! I am addicted to the game
B0055SWM08|5.0|I heard that there was a problem on it with the kindle but I downloaded it and it had no probs on mine.Anyway its an awesome game and has stunning graphics and controls work perfectly. I really don't like puzzle games and this one kept me entertained for hours.
B0055SWM08|5.0|quell is addictive!  the puzzles are challenging and fun.  great way to unwind.  I got this as a free app of the day, but have enjoyed it so much, I'm considering purchasing the sequel after I'm done mastering this one.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its so much fun it reminds me or Mario haha idk what to say but its a really good game that everyone should get
1451648537|5.0|Fantastic book, could not put it down. I work in technology and had heard rumors of his demeanor but had no idea how truly mean spirited and complicated he was.  He made a huge impact on the world and I loved reading every detail in this book, especially the thought process behind the products. I will never look at my IPAD or any other Apple product the same way. I felt guilty using my IPAD cover this week! :)  Very well written and will likely read more from this author. One thing I find so strange. Clearly Steve Jobs was a control freak and so very detail obsessed yet he allowed the author to write what he wanted without any form of control. Anyone else find this odd?
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its awesome i love it reminds me of mario fun as heck really good play it all the time funny lookin lep
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read the book while recuperating from a hospital stay and was very anxious to start it after hearing all the hype.  The first few<br />chapters were interesting but I kept waiting for a real story-line.  I began to be bored after about 5 chapters of the same sex actions.<br />I tried to finish the book but thought it was a waste of time.  The author is very talented in explicitly describing the sexual<br />sensations without it coming across as total porn but I think she was lucky to get the good reviews in the media.  I did not like it.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Flawless. Works just like the web version and synge without any problems. . . . . . . . . . .
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quite an enjoyable game. Challenges the mind and is a great time filler! I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a find...it out of the park brilliant, well written, and it's an indie work which competes with the publishing houses in every way except price.  I could not put it down even reading it from just under the table on my kindle tonight.  Mr. Howey is clearly on my favorite authors list from this point on.  I was totally into this world, it's issues, and the characters. Wool is on my top five for the overall best books I have read this year.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Wonderfully written!.  It was pretty racy.. in other words not a book for the Church Book Club.  I was happy to find it's a trilogy.  I wasn't quite ready to say good-bye to Christian.
B006R1T40I|5.0|a record worth the wait. the music is outstanding as well as the lyrics. Bonnie sounds great as well. its great to have artists like bonnie that make music worth listening to. too much stuff on the radio is pure crap. buy this record, its a jem
B007918P1E|5.0|If you're familiar with Epica and liked Design Your Universe then You'll like this album.  They make very good use of contrasting the heavy with the beautiful and melodic.  They're the best symphonic metal band out right now (in my opinion) and I'd recommend them to anyone who is open to that type of music.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I liked playing the game.  it is very addicting. it is like super Mario brothers leprechaun style.  very fun andbeasy to play.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a wonderful way to get a book!! Downloaded in seconds!, book fabulous and read in a day.<br />I would recommend this method of purchasing books to everyone.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very addictive and challenging. love it!! this sentence is here to help me reach the required amount of words in order to submit my review.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game<br /><br />they want to much money to keep the game going. the second you drunk out of energy you pay or you wait till the game reloads power.
0545405777|5.0|I don't read too much, but wanted to read this before I see the movie.  It is written in a way that captures you, the way one chapter leads you into the next seemed to make it unable for me to put this book down.  I now can't wait to read Catching Fire and Mocking Jay.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is pretty cool. It's challenging and fun.. its a surprise that its free but I'm glad it is.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love this game so much. once I got it I could not put it down. its a version of Mario if he was a lep.<br />this game doesn't. freeze or act up on the kindle fire like most games.  def my top fav apps n its free!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have no one to blame but myself; I heard Ryan Gossling was going to play the part of Christian, possibly, and being a movie buff, wanted to read the book first. Well, like my title says, this book set off my gut-o-meter, you know, that inner feeling of UGH, when something crosses the line of decency. It's a feeling in the gut that says 'this isn't right' The fact that it was written by a woman totally threw me. I think the popularity of this series, (Yep, there are 2 more books to go, and they won't be read by me!) speaks to how porn and depravity are gradually becoming mainstream. Where's the outrage? My concern is that the series will be as popular as Harry Potter and we will have a whole new generation of young people who think the activities in this book are 'cool'. I wonder at the author's motivation for writing the books.
6302921228|5.0|I loved the little mermaid series every since i was a child and i want to pass it on to my 3 yr old nephew
0062101897|5.0|Perfect book to buy after reading and watching all the books. I love this book so much; even if it's so heavy. Excellent quality, pages are sleek and shiny and the pictures are very high quality. I read it every time I feel like reminiscing on the series. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|I have been looking for a Greatest Hits collection for the longest time for Whitney Houston and couldn't find anything that had the song selection that I wanted.  When I found this CD, I ordered it right away!  The only song that I don't care for is I'm Your Baby, Tonight, because the music has been changed from the original version that I grew up with.  Other than that, I LOVE IT!  These are the songs I grew up listening to!  Any Whitney Houston fan would love this CD.
1423113462|5.0|If I had to summarize the plot of this book in three sentences, I would say that Jason finds Camp Half Blood, Jason Journeys to California, and Jason rescues Hera. The main themes in this book include Adventure, Friendship, and Action. These themes relate to my life because Life is an adventure, Friendship can get you through life, and Action is around every corner. The main characters of the story could be described as Brave, Funny, and Helpful. Because Jason stands up against a giant, Piper helps Jason through the quest, and Leo makes funny jokes about life.  I would describe the author's writing style as suspenseful. One quote from the book that illustrates this is \\"Put that cage to sleep while I fight the monsters\\" . My favorite scene was where Leo, Jason, and Piper are in the sewer because Leo makes a lot of jokes.  The climax of the story is exciting because Jason gets to fight an army of monsters. The ending of the story is satisfying because Jason finds out where Percy Jackson. If there were one question I would ask the author of this book, it would be, why Jason speaks Latin. I would recommend this book to a friend because it is great for lovers of action and adventure.
B0018CENUC|5.0|I just love this CD for listening in the car, at home, and even at work! Toby always manages to inspire and entertain with his songs. I highly recommend this purchase for all country fans!
B007SSEBCU|2.0|This movie focused too much on the end of Ms. Thatcher's life instead of telling the story of the remarkable things that she did while she served as Prime Minister. Once again the Hollywood leftist elite told the story the way they wanted it to be remembered. I was expecting the story of an exceptional woman who accomplished amazing things during a tumultuous time. Instead, the story focused on what Ms. Thatcher MAY be like now-- elderly, delusional, and confused. I kept waiting for the movie to go into the main story, and it never did. I'm so glad we didn't buy this movie on DVD as it would have been a tremendous waste of money and storage space.<br /><br />In the long term, people will remember Margaret Thatcher as the great person that she was, long after they will have forgotten everything about the people who made this disappointing movie.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I don't know how to play but I like it a lot I'm very exited to play hay Hahahaha haha see you later
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is super fun its so adficting and fun its kind of like the game mario bros  and super mario bros
B005NKGEP2|5.0|I was captivated by the back and forth between the present day - Kate meets a former friend in Paris and is suddenly very scared - and the flashbacks, back to Kate's husband decision to relocate to Luxembourg, and their ensuing life.<br /><br />To follow her husband Dexter overseas, Kate finally abandons her classified job, a career she has always kept secret from her husband.<br /><br />She hopes for a more satisfying life as a housewife and mother of two small boys, but quickly boredom sets in. There are some really funny details of her getting quickly fed up with the cooking, endless laundry-folding and Lego-playing. She's completely ovewhelmed by taking care of her boys full-time, not very good at making small talk with other moms, and frustrated by how how often absent her husband is, due to his mysterious new job involving banking IT security. (This is Luxembourg and confidentiality standards run high).<br /><br />Then Kate and her husband meet another expat couple, Julia and Bill. They're not like the other expats- there is something fake about them, and even dangerous, and red flags start appearing all over to Kate. Who are they really and what are they looking for? Is it her? is it her husband?<br />It is hard for her to distinguish between life-long, professional habits of suspicion, grown out of her boredom in her new life, and actual details that just don't add up. She begins to investigate them with some help of her old network.<br />As exciting as it is for her to finally do something again, she has no idea what she has set up to uncover. The pieces fall into place neatly, one after the other - a lot of the enjoyment I got out of the book was trying to second-guess where this was going, as a lot of layers of deception and as many secrets are slowly exposed.<br />I liked how true the family details rang and the whole issue of trust versus silence between her and her husband. How do you keep huge secrets or doubts from the person you love most in the world? Although Kate has dealt with this as a professional all her life, she finds out that when it comes to her own family, she's a lot less cool about it. There is a lot of tension and suspense in the book, but no gore, or hardly, nor wild escapes or gunfire. Except for one scene described, it was utterly not violent.<br /><br />The trick of alternating between past and present is brilliantly pulled off, especially as the \\"present day\\" is really all happening within one day - it also kept me on edge with all the new burning questions appearing, and although the final resolution of the very final puzzle was just a little bit over the top, all in all it was absolutely outstanding and un-put-down-able!ld?

B005VTS4EY|5.0|there should be a walkthrough to it for people who are stumped on a certain level. other than that, it is a very fun game.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its a fun game.. energy builds up on an hour. ive been playing for 3 weeks haven't spent a dime
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a very good game but the points to collect take forever purchase new games. it is still a fun game though.
B003L77GGA|3.0|Let me start off by saying when for the first four seasons, Smallville was my favorite show. It was still in my top five until season 8. And to my surprise, I still liked it after Lex left. But by season 9, it had run out of steam... and they just kept right on going. And that gets my goat a little. Most of this season seems like filler for the finale. I watched this season to see Clark become Superman. But that last episode is mostly Lois and Clark deciding if they are going to get married or not. Like some cheesy romance show. It's like they forgot who the original audience for the show was - largely young males. Then, to top it off, you don't even really get a good look at Welling as Superman. I personally felt robbed. I think the original integrity of the show was sacrificed in this so-so season.<br /><br />On the plus side, though, It looks and sound great. The 1080p transfer looks better than a lot of TV shows I've seen on Blu Ray.<br /><br />Welling and the other producers just should have known when to quit.
B007HJ91HU|1.0|I rented this movie with high hopes of seeing a great remake of a great classic. I was very disappointed. Maybe it would have been different if I had not seen the original, but for me this version just doesn't compare and was very difficult for me to sit through.<br /><br />They did make some changes to \\"modernize\\" it a bit for today's youth, but I felt those efforts were corny and lacking. Even the efforts to try to mimic the original version were corny. I was also disappointed that Ren's mom was not included in this version. Overall, a huge disappointment for me.<br /><br />Sometimes it's best to allow a classic just remain a classic...
B007PTJOV0|5.0|the adds aren't annoying they are Tiny in the corner of the screen I love it if I had kids I would let them play it :o
B000066NW0|5.0|i have also bought this album of avril lavigne's and i thought the album was good.i thought the album was put together very well,the songs on there are very good and very well put together.i recommend people to buy this album it is worth the wait.so i would like to thank amazon for having this album in stock i will continue to buy items off your website.sincerly chrisfan.

0439023521|4.0|This is a book for teenagers.  It is not particularly well written and all of the characters are two-dimensional and cartoonish, but the concept is original.  It is an entertaining story, and it has a quality that does draw the reader in and does not let go.<br />I wish Ms. Collins continued success, and I would like to thank her for The Hunger Games.  It's been a LONG time since I got to read such an original story.  It entertaining and gave me a few days of reading pleasure.  Well worth $7 at Wal Mart.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|i have bought this album of hers and the album wasn't really the best album she made.it didn't sound like her other albums that she made.i only like a few songs off the album but other than that i thought the album wasn't really her best.people can buy this album and give their own opinion's to what they think of this album of hers. sincerly chrisfan.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this app quite a bit. its a very convenient way to pass time. super awesome! my mom plays this game daily. sometimes I have to tell her my kindle isn't charged fully.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I waited in anticipation of receiving this order to complete my set of the Happy Feet dvd's. Loved the fact that I no longer have to worry about finding it locally or fighting the crowds in the stores.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app! I use it on my Droid rzr and it works Great! Easy 2 set up and it doesn't take up room on my screen.
0439023513|2.0|I finished this book and sat lost like Katniss.  The first two slow to start always picked<br />up, but Mockingjay went back and forth into a who to trust story reaching for an actual plot.  If the author meant to show what happens to people in war, she accomplished that with the first two books.  The way the story goes Katniss is just an image for the opposition in the war not a general.  Its not a soldiers fight but a civilian broken down by war.  When she doubted everyone and everything, because Peeta was a mutt and Gale was ignoring her and focusing on the \\"hunt\\", I expected the author to do what made Katniss so excellent in the first novel, survive.  I saw an alliance between her and her roommate turn into a vigilantes battle.  They steal weapons break out and go after Snow alone.  And Coin turning on the family and friends in her protection, because Katniss didn't play by the rules and is now the new threat.<br /><br />I get that the Capitol and thirteen are the polar opposites but that the leaders are the same.  Snow is male.  Coin is female.  Thirteen rations all supplies, strict rules, dull uniforms.  The capitol is waste full and extravigant and needs entertainment.  But both leaders stop at nothing to enforce their laws and stay in power.  And both see Katniss and Peeta as their propaganda.<br /><br />With every chapter I saw it going a different way but it only lingered.  And I did get that the story started in the first novel with her saving Prim only to have her killed in the end, irony.  Yet, I feel the whole book is a game of real or not real in Katniss' head, after Prim is killed the rest of the novel seems not real.<br /><br />The ending was rushed.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|loved it its like what happened. after. the Oregon &quot; trail.  awesome game been playing 2 days. really fun got my sis to play :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|New update is awesome and it does not need wi-fi to play Epic Game the whole series is awesome Epic
1595826971|4.0|I played the first game when I was younger and I loved it; so naturally when I heard they were making a second one, I had the highest hopes it would at least be as good as the first. Turns out, the second game is BETTER than the original (in my opinion at least), and a lot of that has to do with graphics and atmosphere. So I had to buy this book, to get my Alice \\"fix\\" and finally see what the creators had in mind during production. Turns out, there's a ton of lovely art in here. All dark and gritty, but still wonderful to look at. Also very imaginative! Everything is presented, from backgrounds to character designs, and of course weapon and dress designs. The game has some tragic undertones, and those are made even more evident in the artbook thanks to a design of Alice having been lobotomized (and absently staring while drool drips from her mouth). I'm glad that exact image was not used in the game itself, because really, it's depressing enough already. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is a number of paintings / drawings which feel unfinished and a bit too naive to me. Bear in mind that I'm not an avid game player, and all the rest of my artbooks are about animated movies - so my standards regarding art quality are a bit higher, I guess. There is, of course, some awesome art in this volume, but those detailed and complex images really just bring out how \\"lazy\\" others are.<br /><br />Still, if you love the games or are a fan of dark fantasy (and maybe of Burton-ish aesthetics and stories), I warmly recommend this book. The positive truly outweights the negative and as a whole this book is a very high quality product. The binding is good, paper quality is good, much of the art is genius and of course the concept is memorable and striking. Recommended.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is the first app I have ever given five stars. there are no problems and it is an all around fun game to play
B007BVOF8E|2.0|I am not familiar with the book or the series that preceded this film. Perhaps that would have made it easier to follow.  It seems to me that movie making is just a more involved way of story telling.  This might have been a great story if it were told well.  Great acting talent just cant make up for poor screenplay and editing.  The bee in the car!!!!  I am convinced that these actors could have been in a great story had it been coherent.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|you do not run out of energy so fast like everyone is saying and it is extremely fun. you should give it a try
B0059XTUVI|4.0|I do not normally write reviews, but i do consider them before renting a movie. I have seen plenty of bad reviews for this film on this site and i want to give my opinion because i think it is unfairly bashed.<br /><br />This is a story, an unbiased story of a woman and her life, and the choices and her courage and her legacy. It is unbiased because it does not see her in a light of good or bad, right or wrong. It sees her as a human being in extraordinary circumstances.<br /><br />this move might be slow for some, but i saw an amazing performance by Meryl Streep and a wondeful portrayal of a woman following her truth and convictions to make a mark in her world.<br /><br />It is focused on her dementia to set the context- but it is the way to set her experience and i find no fault in that.<br /><br />enjoy if you enjoy human stories - as a woman, I am inspired and I am pretty liberal.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love this app. if you like Mario bros games you will love this. I hope to see a sequel. the only negative is the lack of variety on world images.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I like to play Quell when waiting because it is easy to pick up where you left off ans relaxing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a pretty awesome puzzle game, especially since I got it for free on the app of the day. What sets this game apart from others is the beautiful and relaxing music that plays while you solve these puzzles, and although I've only played about 15 minutes of it so far, I believe there's an ambient story to discover. Basically, this is one of the better puzzle games I've played and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good puzzle game on Android.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like solitaire. It stimulates the mind and it's a good thing to do when you have nothing to do. :) It also teaches you strategy which could help you in life.

B005D51II0|5.0|The Decca Sound is a super-bargain set of 50 CD's for just about $2/CD (at the present time), which is an extraordinarily low price for such a high quality collection of works and performances.<br /><br />They are organized by Conductor or Artist, and in some cases by theme, but from my point of view I would describe the contents of this box set in the following way:<br /><br />First, there are a number of works that are generally considered to be part of a recommended \\"basic library\\" of classical music:<br /><br />- Violin Concertos: Barber, Beethoven, Bruch (#1), Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky<br />- Piano Concertos: Brahms (#1), Mozart (#20, 27), Prokofiev (#3), Rachmaninov (#3), Saint-Saens (#2)<br />- Symphonies: Bruckner (#4), Dvorak (#9), Messiaen, Shostakovich (#5), R. Strauss (Alpine Symphony)<br />- Other Orchestral Works: Elgar (Enigma Variations), Falla (Noches en los jardines de Espana), Holst (The Planets), Mendelssohn (A Midsummer Night's Dream), Mussorgsky (Pictures at an Exhibition), Ravel (Daphnis et Chloe), Respighi (Roman Trilogy), J. Strauss (Walzes - the complete 1979 New Year's Concert), Stravinsky (The Rite of Spring, The Firebird)<br />- Chamber Music: Mendelssohn (Octet), Beethoven (String Quartets)<br />- Instrumental Works: Bach (Goldberg Variations), Beethoven (Piano Sonata's 8, 14, 21), Schumann (Carnaval)<br />- Vocal Works: Bach (Cantata 140, Magnificat), Britten (War Requiem), Haydn (Nelson Mass), Walton (Belshazzar's Feast)<br /><br />Second, there are several discs that contain excerpts and highlights from important Opera's and other vocal works:<br /><br />- Ceccilia Bartoli, accompanied by Andras Schiff, performing works by Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, Haydn<br />- Renee Fleming, performing with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir George Solti, great scenes from Opera's by Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Verdi, Britten and R. Strauss<br />- Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music, performing Dido and Aeneas by Henry Purcell<br />- Excerpts from Wagner's Ring, Sir George Solti<br />- The Three Tenors in Concert, 1990<br />- Puccini Turandot highlights (Sutherland, Pavarotti, Caballe, Pears)<br />- A disc with a performance by Joan Sutherland, Marilyn Horne, and Luciano Pavarotti, Live from Lincoln Center (1981)<br /><br />Third, there are numerous works, that while not part of the \\"basic library\\", are ones that an individual, when building a classical music collection, will probably want to add at some point:<br /><br />- Falla, the Three-Cornered Hat<br />- Rimsky-Korsakov, Capriccio Espagnol<br />- Sibelius, Symphony #1<br />- Walton, Violin Concerto<br />- R. Strauss, Don Juan<br />- Charles Ives, Symphony #2<br />- Saint-Saens, Piano Concerto's #4 & 5<br /><br />And finally, there are works that may be somewhat less well known, and may be new even to someone who has been enjoying Classical Music for a long time:<br /><br />- Moszkowski, Spanish Dances<br />- Berlin Cabaret Songs, performed by Ute Lemper, Matrix Ensemble<br />- Susato, Dansereye (1551), New London Consort, Philip Pickett<br />- \\"Romantic Russia\\", a disc containing compositions by Glinka, Mussorgsky, Borodin, and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir George Solti<br /><br />Performers are all at the very highest level and performances are superb.<br /><br />The above is not comprehensive of everything included on the 50 CD's, but I have tried to cover as much as possible, and I hope that it provides a sense of the scope of the collection.<br /><br />The packaging is completely satisfactory. The box itself is reasonably heavy-duty and opens in clamshell fashion to provide easy access to any of the CD's individually. Each CD is in its own cardboard sleeve, with a reproduction of the original LP cover on one side, and a brief track listing on the other. The booklet provides full details of each CD including the recording location and date. Finally, it includes two short essays: The Decca Sound, by Michael Gray, and Fifty Years of Great Decca Recordings, by Raymond McGill. The documentation is therefore fully adequate and better than one might expect at a bargain price.<br /><br />To have such a collection available at an almost incredibly low price - this is astonishing and hard to pass up! I certainly could not, even though it does duplicate many works that I already own, but with different artists and performances.<br /><br />If you love classical music and welcome the opportunity to add some excellent performances as well as some new compositions to your collection, or if you have someone who you would like to introduce to classical music by giving them a broad selection of pieces representing essentially all variations within the classical spectrum; whatever your reason, I cannot see how you could be disappointed with this set.<br /><br />ADDED NOTE 2/26/15: for those who transfer their music to iTunes or similar digital program, I've discovered that Decca has a website where you can get the proper album artwork for each of the 50 discs in this collection. Simply go to http://deccasound.com/boxset.php, and you will see all 50 albums - click on each one and you'll get the proper cover art and can simply drag it over into your iTunes listing for that particular disc (these things don't always get filled in properly if you let iTunes or its online resources, Gracenote for example, make the selection for you).ce.

B003L77G10|5.0|My wife and I do not have cable, so we've been catching up on this show over the past year. Well acted, well written (for the most part) and deserving in the praise it's received in the media and the industry.

I highly recommend it and am giving it as a gift to some friends who are heading off on a Hawaii vacation to enjoy!  Thanks very much to Amazon for ensuring the package arrived so quickly after I placed the order!
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|A pretty good movie, my wife is of Hawaiian descend so we were quite interested on how the movie would play out.  Not enough real hawaiians were included, even tho we know that many hawaiians take the haole color.  I did like the fact that at the ending of the movie ole george decided not to sell the land.  I did not like the scene where the wife of the other guy blamed george and his family, they should have reworked that scene differently.  THe scenes of hawaii, on kaui, the hospital etc were wonderful.. we were in hawaii this past sept/oct and had ocassion to go to queens hospital, it was exactly as the movie showed it.  also, my wife's family is originally from kaui, and the scene where the family is looking at the property to be sold looks exactly like the scene where one of her cousins lives, but in kapaa.  A fairly good movie, just wished more real hawaiians had been included.

B0073XORCY|5.0|I was in college when Thick As A Brick was released in 1972. Back then, the time between the advent of the Beatles and the beginning of Disco, was like being around during the time of Beethoven or Mozart. Rock was at it's pinancle of creativity and musicianship. Jethro Tull was a major player in this arena of musical invention. Their follow up to Aqualung was Thick As A Brick. To Jethro Tull fans, it merited countless listenings, as another rock breakthrough.<br /><br />Now 40 years later, I was intrigued to hear that there was a follow up to Thick As A Brick. In the current, time when the closest music to real \\"rock\\", is \\"country\\", (a sad commentary), I was hopeful that something \\"new\\" might take me back to being 21 again. TAAB2 exceeded all expectations. Perhaps the best thing I can say about it, is that it could have been released 2 or 3 years after the original. It's sound is somewhat more sophisticated than the original, but that is as it should be, as back then, music continued to build off of itself.<br /><br />So I recommend you buy this album, relax in a comfy chair, crank up your sound system, and savor every note, as you did way back then. Your only regret will be that your not holding a full size vinyl LP.<br /><br />To me, this new album is such a pleasure, that I got me daydreaming about other \\"2\\" follow-ups that would be fun[[ASIN:B0073XORCY Thick As A Brick 2 Special Edition]] to hear.<br /><br />Could we get Bowie to do a \\"Ziggy Stardust 2\\", or maybe Clapton to do a \\"Layla 2\\". How about, Yes doing \\"Close to the Edge 2\\". Maybe Edgar Winter has a \\"Frankenstein 2\\" still in him.<br /><br />I guess those suggestions won't happen. So be content to put on the headphones, crank it up, and enjoy your one hour visit to the musical quality of 40 years ago.
B004UC4HCG|4.0|The long and short of it, after a tiny modification this is the best case/mobo combo I have ever had. The case is a solid build and while the motherboard doesn't have any overclocking options it isn't a deal breaker for me because I don't overclock. The \\"ICE\\" cooling system is shockingly good. I had initially had my doubts about it but it appears to work better than a Zalman cooler I have in another similar machine. The fan is also ultra quiet.<br /><br />The single con for the the case is the front panel audio ports. If you have high quality headphones you plan to use them you will notice an audible buzz when connected to only the front panel not the back. I couldn't initially tell if the buzz was coming from USB noise (The usb ports are on the same board.) or perhaps the fact that the power for my video card was in close proximity to the audio cables. (The buzzing changes frequency as I move my mouse or when a lot is going on, on the screen.)<br /><br />This can be fixed, and if you don't like the idea of carving a notch out of the board that holds the front panel audio and USB ports then you may not want to go the exact route I chose but I did 2 things.<br /><br />First thing was to take aluminum tape and wrap the tape around the cords that connect from the main board to the daughter board to provide shielding. (just the audio cable connector) I didn't test after this because I didn't want to open up the case again if it didn't work so I went ahead and also made my second modification.<br /><br />The daughter board has a unified ground plane that could be the source of USB noise. You can take a Dremel and separate the USB ground plane from the audio one.<br /><br />Now the case is beyond my expectations and even after having to do the mod's I still think it was a good buy.
B007SSDS24|2.0|The story has potential, but never took off in the movie. The acting was not great and the movie just has too many sterotypes in it that makes it lose any credibility. I was disappointed watching this in the theaters. Better to watch it on cable than to pay for it.

B0059XTUVI|4.0|As one of history's great monsters - not quite in the same league as Caligula, Hitler, Stalin and Idi Amin, but not far behind - Thatcher deserves far more scathing disrespect than she gets in this rather innocuous bio.<br /><br />Like her crony and soul-mate Ronald Reagan, she came close to destroying one of the greatest nations this world has yet seen. But the Brits are luckier than we are: since Thatcher's fall, they've had a string of relatively humane leaders, while (except for Bill Clinton) ours just get worse and worse.<br /><br />For about half a century the US passed the UK as the greatest civilization on earth, but that balance is quickly being reversed. So long, US! Welcome back to the top, UK! Maybe soon Reagan - our homegrown monster - will get even harsher and even more richly deserved cinematic disrespect than Thatcher gets here.
B005LAIHAY|3.0|Luc Besson has been behind some of the best action and sci-fi films of the past eighteen years; directing films such as Leon: The Professional and The Fifth Element and contributing to the writing process for films such as Kiss of the Dragon, The Transporter, Revolver, and From Paris With Love. Besson's films aren't always the smartest or the best written, but they don't have to be when they're usually so damn entertaining. On top of that, I'm a fairly huge Guy Pearce fan other than last month's Seeking Justice, which we'll just pretend doesn't exist for the sake of argument. So Lockout looked like it could be a hell of a lot of fun, but there was something I couldn't quite put my finger on that didn't seem quite right in the trailers and TV spots.<br /><br />Accused of a crime he didn't commit, Snow (Guy Pearce) is about to be locked away for thirty years. The president's daughter Emilie Warnock (Maggie Grace) is sent to a prison in outer space to help psychologically diagnose the prisoners when an interrogation goes wrong and prisoner Hydell (Joseph Gilgun) escapes and sets all 400+ prisoners on the space station free. Snow is offered his freedom if he can break into the prison and rescue Emilie.<br /><br />Lockout has this superb beginning. The interrogation sequence with Snow and Langral (Peter Stormare) and the fight sequence immediately afterwards are both extremely entertaining and fast paced. The closing part of it with the gun is something taken right out of a Jackie Chan flick, which should be taken as the highest compliment. The entire movie has incredible momentum anyway as the slower moments are tense and everything else is just go-go-go the whole time. Snow is a great character, as well. While he's basically John McClane from the Die Hard films, he's the most entertaining character Pearce has ever played. Cynical, sarcastic, and a complete smart aleck, Snow reminds me of me to the most exaggerated extent.<br /><br />Things begin to go downhill fast during the freeway chase. The special effects are very unusual. Everything is so blurry and whizzes by you so fast that you can't really process what's going on. It's like it almost feels like it's low budget or something, but it's not quite that bad. The outer space battles are along the same lines. The Snow character never gets old though as he's downright hilarious throughout the entire movie. His interactions with Emilie are just as good if not slightly better as both Pearce and Grace have fairly decent chemistry together on-screen.<br /><br />The sci-fi action film has this Paul W.S. Anderson and Michael Bay quality to it that keeps you from fully enjoying it. The TV spots are comparing Lockout to Die Hard and Blade Runner. While there is a small Blade Runner vibe early on before Snow is shipped off into space, it disappears quickly. Lockout is more like a combination of Die Hard, The One, Event Horizon (without all of the implications of hell), and Armageddon. It's like there's something good in there, but it has to compete for your attention with its weird special effects and storyline that doesn't exactly put you off entirely but feels hackneyed to a certain degree.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the thoroughly amusing and brilliantly written character of Snow, Lockout probably wouldn't be worth seeing at all. Since he is though, Luc Besson has helped create another fairly satisfying sci-fi action adventure. It's just a shame that its entertainment value fluctuates so often throughout its duration.ing the freeway chase. The special effects are very unusual.

1596590440|1.0|Many times throughout the audiobook the reader mentions using the PDF on the last CD of the audiobooks. The CD has charts & whatnot to further expand upon content that doesn't come across in the audiobook and needs to be physically utilized. Unfortunately, the publisher neglected to actually put the PDF on the audiobook, so the content is missing.  Get the paper copy - the audiobook is fairly useless without some of the print materials.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Outwardly, a sexual sadist and a sadist may appear identical, until just before and immediately after the safeword is called. A sexual sadist will continue regardless of the safeword or will be completely and totally shocked when the safeword is called. He will have lost himself in his needs instead of in the needs of his submissive. A sadist on the other hand, will probably stop before the safeword is called because he pays that much attention to his submissive, that he is able to tell when she is about to cry out for the scene to end. If she does find the need to call out the safeword, the scene stops immediately and the sadist spends the next several minutes (sometimes hours) attending to the needs, desires and wants of the submissive. He goes over the scene verbally with her to ensure that both parties understand why there was a need for a safeword and why it was called. He does his very best to make sure that he never puts the submissive in that place again, after all his goal is her pleasure, not her pain.<br /><br />Ms. James also seems to think that all submissives are weak, overly-dependent, child-like creatures who will break at the slightest bit of wind. She portrays this by having Mr. Grey confirm to Ana over and over again that she is much too strong to ever be his submissive. Ms. James goes so far as to have the only two submissives we meet in the book be extremely weak characters, one of whom attempts suicide and then is found stalking Mr. Grey and Ana. The brief conversations between Ana and Leila (the submissive in the books) show Leila to be a very fragile creature that is to be handled with extreme care because she is so emotionally unstable. The very fact that Mr. Grey would choose a character like Leila to be his submissive speaks volumes to me about what kind of a \\"dom\\" Mr. Grey was.<br />Another thing that royally pissed me off about the Mr. Grey character is his overwhelming jealousy. Someone in his position, with as much power and control as is needed to be the leader and CEO of so many different companies, would not be an easily jealous person. Jealousy is a sign of weakness and weak people don't run companies for long, they wind up getting eaten alive by people much stronger than they are.<br /><br />At several points throughout the book we are told that Mr. Grey is more of an adolescent than a man, at least emotionally. Even his therapist tells Ana this at one point. I am appalled that Ana continued to date and eventually marry Mr. Grey after learning so much about him. Yes, she certainly has unconditional love for him, but in my honest opinion, her love shouldn't be unconditional. She is not his mother, she is not his sister, and she does not deserve to be walking on eggshells for the rest of her life worrying that Mr. Grey is going to lose his stuff over one thing or another.<br /><br />There are so many red flags raised by Mr. Grey's character that I wound up resenting him and Ms. James' portrayal of BDSM. She has one messed up viewpoint on the whole scene if you ask me. Please understand, healthy BDSM relationships do not look anything like that of Mr. Grey and Miss Steele.is needed to be the leader and CEO of so many different companies, would not be an easily jealous person.

This gripping book has the most original plot I've seen yet: A woman is suffering from a memory disorder that makes her wake up every morning having forgotten most of the key events of her life, then starts working with a doctor who tells to write everything down she experiences or remembers in a journal and read it every day. She soon discovers that her husband is lying to her about many important aspects of their life and from there, the plot takes fascinating twists and turns that I'll avoid describing so as not to spoil the suspense.<br /><br />It's genius the way the author brings this fascinating character to life through her journal and makes her totally believable from start to finish, despite the extraordinary premise of the story, which could sound far-fetched if written by someone else.
B0073PZIYI|4.0|A good clean movie. One day this could be real, ha ha.<br />I think they could have spent a little more time in the plot of this movie and made it a little better it did drag on here and there. I would suggest seeing this.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|Here's the deal.  You live in a small place, and you have no hope of using kinect.  This little lens does the job, and restores hope.<br /><br />It won't be perfect.  The worst part is navigation with your hand... Tends to jump around the screen.  In game, it works fine.  Sometimes it acts up, but it works.<br /><br />To be specific, the issues are with increased jitters and, since it basically compresses the depth of space perception by kinect, depth is much more sensitive in-game.  Take slightly too big of a step back or forward and the game might think you're making a bigger move than you really are.  It also just isn't able to sense the depth of your body parts as well, so it occasionally looses track of your arm or something.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy because I can get in on some pretty sweet kinect action with this thing, and otherwise there would be no hope in my small city apartment..  If you have the space in your living room to get kinect to work though, then I'd use this as a last resort.  Otherwise, get this thing if you want to play.  Just don't expect to play super competitive at top performance or something.  Just for fun, it works great!
B00356CO1E|5.0|I am not one to workout, ever. The last time I stepped foot in a gym or attempted a workout video was 6 years ago. I recently lost 25 pounds and hit a plateau. (I still have 30-40 pounds to go) I knew the way to continue was to bite the bullet and workout. I picked this one because I could download it via instant video to my PS3 and watch it on TV and because it was only 20 minutes. (I work full time, have 3 kids and go to school full time, I don't have a lot of spare time.) Jillian kicks your butt! It goes by really fast because you are constantly changing exercises and areas you are working on. And boy do I feel it! I am only on day 2 but am excited to keep going and see a change in my body.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game keeps you entertain and is an excellent way to keep your mind sharp. Best of all if you get stuck in a level it gives you hints to solve the puzzle.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun game i really like it. this is a game if your borad or play it with friends
1400069289|5.0|I'm about half way through this book, and it has become a habit, replacing ken ken as my going to bed ritual. reading it on an iphone is a bit tedious but not too bad because the author's style is fast-paced and breezy. I think his belief and group theory could use more elaboration...I believe beliefs are based largely on prior experience ..i.e. I know it will work this time because I've done something similar in the past, and groups work better because there is a greater likelihood that someone in the group has had the experience before and will be able to persuade the others of his/her thinking. In any case, a great read, great examples, and I look forward to finishing the book, at which time, I will be craving something else by the same author.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Mario like awesome game and its free. I can imagine how hard work people put in it. really appereciate for giving it for free.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I would have marked this as a ZERO because of one simple fact. Basically, this is plagurism at its finest. So...any of you typically brainwashed readers of materials promoted en masse ever hear of \\"Battle Royale?\\" Yup. I did. Suzanne Collins can write, sure. But her story? Is all a lie. It is almost carbon copied from a 12-plus year old Japanese story. Look it up. AND I am sure that Mrs. Collins will claim she never heard of it. Riiiiight. Just like Meyer never copied from Buffy.....just like JJ Abrams never copied from La Femme Nikita...etc...C'mon people...name an original thought that has come from an American \\"creative (cough)\\" force that didn't derive from a Japanese, Chinese, British, German, Spanish, etc. original idea. Collins may be able to write good emails that are original and some other stuff in creative form. But her shining moment is a lie. Don't believe me? LOOK IT UP!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Dont judge a book by its cover. when i was buying this game it looked boring but after i bought it i cant stop playing it
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is fun just aggravating when you run out of energy it takes a while before you really get to start going again
B0025UHKNS|1.0|Worked for 3 months, thereafter stopped acquiring satellites, would only acuire satellites on first charge after a  full discharge of he device. On sending it to the service centre which is Taiwan for me ( I reside in Mumbai, India) the watch was sent back without a proper check. (software upgrade and a cleaning!). GPS function continued to be the same, i.e. the device did not acquire satellites. Garmin washed their hands off. As a result I spent 220 USd for buying the device, and another 100 USD for trying to get it fixed!<br />Extremely disappointed

0307593312|2.0|Having read IQ84 on my Kindle, I was not at first aware of it's massive length.  Granted, the author is a good, possibly excellent writer, however for a busy, non-intellectual reader who utilizes spare moments to read for enjoyment, this is not the book to choose.  I found it extremely repetitive.  What happened to concise, economy of words?  It could have easily been cut to two thirds it's present length without any loss of beauty or meaning.<br /><br />The extra third would have been better utilized to explain its \\"mysteries\\" and to tie up loose ends.  Who were The Little People?  Where did they come from? Why? What was the meaning of the two moons?  What happened to the girlfriend who was \\"irretrievably lost?\\"  And on and on.<br /><br />After all the time it took to read this tome and still not have answers to the questions that plagued me throughout, I felt very unsatisfied.  In the end, IQ84 turns out to be merely a love story in a weird setting where anything can happen for no apparent reason.  Call it Science Fiction and now it's a masterpiece?  Talk about an air chrysalis!
B004UID2LC|5.0|this is so freking awesome!!!! you can download vids from youtube and still watch them when you dont have wifi or if you uninstalled this App..!!!!definatley get it  its a must
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this free game is fun yet it can sometimes be hard to get enough points to move to the next level.  you must keep going back to the past game to earn more. there are many different games that are not of the free version.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game reminds me of mafia wars, or any of the games for that matter, on facebook .  It's fun for a bit then you have to wait on your energy to refill.  I'm not on my kindle 24/7, and when I wanna play I don't wanna wait for energy.  Besides that, it's a cute game without issues.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is an awfully great app. anyone would be lucky to have it. anyone who gives this app three stars or lower is clearly &quot;kookoo*&quot;
B0053TMP24|5.0|Usually authors lose readers towards the end of long series, but The Son of Neptune was just as intriguing as the Percy Jackson series! I really liked it, and I couldn't put it down. Rick hasn't lost his touch!

0375812024|5.0|purchased this as a gift for my nephew whos dad is an air traffic controller.  He had a lot of fun looking at it and having it read to him.  Lots of similarities to his dads day at work
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it! just like Mario bros. takes me back to my childhood.. such good memories. best thing about this is it was free!
006197806X|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I thought it was still a good book! I read this back to back with Delirium and was so enthralled with the descriptions of Portland and each contact Alex and Lena had, that I was a little let down by the second book in that regard. The pace is faster with more action but a bit repetitive in what happens (how love develops). Still, I was hooked and read this sucker in one day...and am looking forward to the next ones. I originally picked up this series because I am a huge fan of the Hunger Games series and Divergent.
0385534639|2.0|In reading all the one star reviews I think a probable explanation is missing.  I get the feeling the author is aiming for Magical Realism, and the \\"true\\" story is in the way these people ARE the circus.  Which is vague and only gets some explanation in the last chapters. Otherwise, it is pretty senseless - and even in saying this, I tend to agree it is still pretty senseless.<br /><br />Some of the descriptive language really is wonderful and the images - the way someone's dress changes color to complement whomever she is standing by - are very pretty and fanciful to imagine.<br /><br />However as a grand adventure, it's not; as a grand love story, it's....sort of. Plus, the childhood abuse of both characters is just kind of - not even minimalized, but ignored.<br /><br />I love circus novels.  But I can understand after reading this you might feel an urge to find the nearest action adventure/mystery/thriller with a cohesive plot and good dialogue - quickly.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|I was admittedly reticent about this book but thought the sample was good enough to purchase the book. I'm a huge fan of the Hunger Games series and just finished Divergent, so was looking for another series along the same vein. Delirium, similar to the other books above, features a strong female protagonist who battles between what's expected in society and who she really is. While at first this seems like a love story, I found it to feature the concept of loss and what people sacrifice to prevent pain and/or heartache. Also, more than HG and Divergent, the world in Delirium (for me at least) was a more near-future extrapolation of what our world could become since we do so much now to numb ourselves and playing-it-safe is the norm.
B004I744AS|5.0|More than just a dictionary and thesaurus, this will help with improving your vocabulary and phrases in multiple languages as well as pronunciation in multiple languages.  What a cool app!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cool and full of surprises the game is always changing bringing back old and the newer characters I love this game
B00005JKZV|5.0|Enjoyed this film filled with elves,  a dwarf, men, and of course, Hobbits.  If you have the first and third film of the trilogy and can't find the second anywhere but thru Amazon.com , as I did, you are in luck!  The film won Academy Awards and is a visual pleasure.
B0000DZ3EN|2.0|Director Walter Murch claims he never intended for this to be a direct sequel to The Wizard of Oz, which sounds to me like a weak excuse for an underachieving film. If I were to release Return to Casablanca, set in an east African nightspot, with Rick Blaine pining over the girl he chased away, I can claim it's unrelated all I like but the comparisons will still be made. Dorothy's return to the world of her imagination is similar in subject matter, with constant references to the MGM classic and cameos by all of the original characters, but feels much more twisted and sinister in tone. Not that the first Oz was lacking in terrifying material - the flying monkeys alone must have fueled millions of nightmares - but those moments were balanced by an optimistic, sing-songy spirit and bright outlook on life. This is more like something from the depths of Tim Burton's catalog, minus the off-kilter conscience. Strange, dark and eerie, it compensates for the lack of a clear purpose by overloading the audience with weirdness.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Really fun game at first. Energy restores 1 every 3 minutes &amp; every time you level up so can play about once per hour if you want. Then crops &amp; buildings that should take 20 minutes or an hour to yield all get reset to 17 HOURS!!!!! I try again the next day &amp; my energy is zero &amp; the 3 minute counter starts. I left it on &amp; refilled but then it all happened again.  Had to uninstall. Complete waste at this point.
B000IMKDPC|4.0|Energetic, surprisingly loyal action / adventure with some brilliant casting choices and a tight, cohesive visual style. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are brilliant choices as Xavier and Magneto, dueling civil rights figureheads on opposite sides of the moral spectrum, but don't get nearly enough scenes together. Of course, Hugh Jackman absolutely defines the role of Wolverine, playing a very clearly defined, potentially cheesy character and pulling it off with vigor. The film's not entirely confident in itself, evidenced by a few hokey plot devices and a handful of godawful lines of comic relief (basically anything that comes out of Halle Berry's mouth), but considering its age and status as the make-or-break point for comic book properties (spoiler: it made) I can overlook a few missteps. Light fun with the kernel of a deeper message nestled beneath several layers of black leather, titanium veneer and bright, colorful effects.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|this app has a ton of USEFULL features, is easy to use, and does an awesome job. a must have for sure.
B0034G4P80|3.0|A solid enough popcorn muncher that never even hints at reaching a deeper level. Chris Hemsworth does what he sets out to, making waves with his appearance if not his acting, while Natalie Portman tries in vain to turn her uncertain supporting role into something more significant. It's really two films under one heading, as the developments in Thor's celestial homeworld of Asgard provide gorgeous vistas but no meat, and the fish-out-of-water character moments of the god of thunder fallen to Earth deliver good-natured, if shallow, fun. With a few listless fight scenes thrown in to stir the waters, Thor never runs the risk of growing stagnant but also doesn't give its audience much to think about. It's all spelled out with no regard for subtlety, hammered into the pre-planned groundwork for Marvel's upcoming Avengers mega-pic with the kind of blunt nuance one might expect from a character known primarily for his rash, impatient brawn. I had fun, but it didn't leave me clamoring for a follow-up.
0439023521|5.0|I picked up this book just to see what all the fuss was about.  From the first page, I was hooked.  I know many have noted the violence in this tale, especially since this is a book targeted towards teen readers.  However, I found that the brutality was neither gratuituous or mindless. Many fantasy books have youthful protagonists involved in lethal action and this was no different.  In fact, what I liked were the questions the story raised; what would I do if I lived a life of destitution?  Would I willingly make sacrifices to save another life, even when faced with my own mortality?  Is it healthy to question the establishment?  What would we do for the price of good television and good public relations?  I read the book in 2 days and found myself eager to get to the sequel.
0871404133|5.0|E. O. Wilson has ignited a valuable debate about how altruism evolved in humans. As an insect specialist he more or less put 'inclusive fitness' or 'Hamilton's rule' on the map as natural selection's preferred mechanism for the evolution of altruism. Then in a famous 2010 article in Nature, and now in The Social Conquest of Earth he says that he was completely wrong and that 'group selection' is how altruism evolved in both eusocial insects and humanity. By group selection Wilson means war to the death between groups - 'total war'. This idea has been around a long time; Darwin believed it, talking off the top of his head without any archaeological evidence about what happened during the two million years of humanity's evolution, and misled by an idea ('Pangenesis') that learned experience was passed down from generation to generation. Recently Samuel Bowles published a paper in Science showing mathematically that warfare could preserve a fragile form of altruism if a mutation for it occurred. Wilson now makes the startling claim that because Bowles's archaeological data shows warfare 'from the beginning of Neolithic times', therefore 'tribal aggressiveness thus goes back well beyond Neolithic times, but no one as yet can say exactly how far'. He then goes on to speculate that because the common chimpanzee is warlike 'there is a good chance' that tribal aggressiveness goes back six million years. The reality is that once you look beyond inclusive fitness (which is one way that altruism can evolve in some creatures) there are many ways that altruism can evolve in humans. People love the idea that warfare delivers benefits, possibly because it reassuringly exorcises war's horrors and apparent inevitability in the modern world. A careful reading of the Bowles paper shows that he has proved that a supposed altruistic gene could be preserved by group selection without warfare, simply because of the climate. His model also describes a population with a small minority of Ned Flanders types with this altruistic gene, whereas real research shows that altruism is universal and not binary. Wilson's mathematical colleague Martin Nowak and the behavioural ecologists use 'multilevel selection' in a much more subtle sense than Wilson's old fashioned 'total war between groups'. It is from them that we are finding out the truth about our altruism, and the controversy ignited by Wilson's book will end up by proving him wrong again.d Flanders types with this altruistic gene, whereas real research shows that altruism is universal and not binary.

B004EWFUQY|5.0|UPDATE#3: 7.5 MONTHS in, 10 lbs out.  For purpose of full disclosure, I am updating this review for the last time.  The 10lbs I lost is based on my weight from 7.5 months ago. I have not significantly gone back to the diet since my update#2 because it was really hard for me to maintain it, and, for personal reasons and preferences, I decided not to live my life with all these limitations.  HOWEVER, I am still very grateful for this diet because this gave me two results: (1) I have been stable at my 10-lb loss so I feel like I lost 10 lbs for good; and (2) I somehow got into a better eating habits, and just as I noted in update#2, for some reason I can't eat as much as I used to.  Even if I want to eat like a pig that I was, I couldn't.  So, my personal final opinion on this diet: it is a great AND EASY way to kickstart your weight loss, if you need one.<br /><br />UPDATE#2: 2.5 MONTHS in, 15 lbs out. However, I lost 15 pounds much earlier, at about the 4-wk mark.  Since then I've been stuck because I've not been diligent with the diet.  But, even though I have been cheating, I have not regained any pound and I have remarkably changed - I don't know if physically or mentally.  I cannot eat as much as I used to anymore, I find myself stopping because I get really physically uncomfortable. And I literally get stomach cramps when I REALLY cheat.  LOSING 15 POUNDS was a breeze, trust me.  Just for losing that I am really grateful to the diet.  Keeping with the diet is the harder part because I got tired preparing my foods (you have to!) and got tired of the same old foods I can quickly prepare.  I am fat because I was never one to spend time & effort preparing my foods - and this diet requires exactly that!  If you are one who loves cooking, my guess is this diet will probably be \\"easy\\" for you  because - again - it's the never-ending preparation that's killing me.  I find it ironic that I never spent so much time in the kitchen until now that I'm dieting!<br />Anyway, Ialso want to point out one thing I learned when I got on this diet: there is soooo many zero-calorie, sugar-free or similar products out there; even 80-calorie sausages (vs. to regular 250) that tastes just as good!  One can definitely survive and still enjoy life with this diet.<br /><br />UPDATE#1: 2.5 weeks in, 8 lbs out.<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST:<br />I just finished reading the book.  This seems to me a GOOD diet for the following reasons:<br />- more of the book is about how to maintain your weight after weight loss<br />- it provides a quick jumpstart to losing weight<br />- it provides a solid, long term structured plan for losing weight, then keeping it<br />- in the end, this book is about being healthy and being mindful of what you eat and what you do<br /><br />Other than the required lifetime daily consumption of oat bran (i want to do further research on long-term effect of doing this)  and the jumpstart phases, the rest of the diet is what we all already know as common sense healthy living, for ex:<br />- being active<br />- not overeating<br />- drinking enough water<br />- eating less fat<br /><br />Yet, the author provides practical ways to accomplish them:<br />- using stairs instead of elevators<br />- doing daily, really simple exercises that can easily be done at home<br />- dont get second servings<br /><br />He allows some  items which make the diet more doable and reasonable (for me, less miserable):<br />- sweetener<br />- low salt<br />- diet soda<br /><br />AND he provides this STRUCTURE one can follow -from weight-loss stage to maintenance stage- thus making success more possible.<br /><br />By the end of the book, he said this about low calorie and balanced diet,  which i think best reflects the very foundation of his diet and shows that he \\"gets\\" it when people say it's hard to lose weight and live a healthy lifestyle.<br /><br />\\"...if  overweight people  were capable of eating a balanced diet, they would never have become overweight.\\"<br /><br />Author seems to understand my predicament, so i think i'll give his diet  a try.

He attempts to locate people from his past, only to find out they are dead, moved on, or don't want anything to do with him...all except for one man, Ethan (Luke Kirby) the son of his former grifter partner, the man Jackson killed. Jackson attempts to avoid criminal activity and Ethan, but his past is there to haunt him. You know a con is going to happen, but who is going to con who?<br /><br />The movie limps along holding your interest, but like any grifter movie, the ending is what determines the genius and likability of the production...dropping clues and hints along the way about the sting and twist.
