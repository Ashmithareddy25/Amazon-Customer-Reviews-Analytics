B005YVSIZ4|3.0|I love the walking dead, and was looking forward to purchasing this in HD. Amazon unbox is great, but to say an episode is in HD is just wrong.  There is no 1080 or even 720 that my eyes could see.  Everything is a little bit sharper, but from now on I'll only buy standard def vids from here.  The little boxy pixels are still apparent in \\"HD\\" I've seen crisper vids off youtube.  Love the series, hate the encoding.  Amazon, if you want my 3 dollars per episode for HD, encode it properly please.  I dont watch this on a 7 inch screen.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|I love Firefly and I was extremely excited to buy this product when it was on sale on Amazon. Based on the images, I was expecting the four disc set with individual cases in a cardboard slipcase. Instead, I received the four discs in the single case... which is what I already own and was planning to give to a friend after I got myself an \\"upgrade.\\" Don't get me wrong, it's a great show and I would give five stars if I were rating the show itself, but the image led me to believe that the \\"4-Disc Version\\" was the default version being sold and was not what I got.
B0052RCX0G|1.0|Amazon strikes again ... how in the HELL can Amazon justify pricing the Kindle version higher then the hardback book?  Insane.  The whole attraction to the Kindle is access to ebooks, and one of the major attractions of ebooks is reduced price.  I'm not one who thinks that authors should not be paid for their work ... that argument is a straw man.  However, it is obvious that there are no ADDITIONAL PER COPY costs to ebooks as there are for the printing and distribution of physical books.  Therefore ebooks should be cheapER, if not actually CHEAP.<br /><br />I'm quite aware that Amazon blames the publisher for the pricing, but I really believe that is a cop out.  Amazon has the clout to negotiate fair prices for its Kindle versions.  It can simply decline to sell physical books from publishers who are not at least a tad reasonable in their pricing.<br /><br />I've seen one other atrocious practice by Amazon recently ... the \\"free\\" magazines ... which are simply free APPLICATIONS which you download and then are given the wonderful opportunity to BUY the magazine.  This is bait and switch.
1600242197|5.0|I read this book and think it is an excellent book about how one becomes a Navy SEAL, what it takes to be a Navy SEAL and the ultimate sacrifice these brave men make for our country.  This book is a moving tribute to those men.  I read this book and purchased it on cd for my father who is legally blind.  He is currently reading it and enjoying it.  It is an important story and one that should be read by all.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|I think that this book has a charm to it. I like a lot of the author's ideas, and was able to get through it fast. The nostalgia factor of this book is tremendous. The book is overflowing with pop culture references to video games, movies, music , and tv.(mostly 80s) I do feel though that the plot turned out to be very deux ex machina , and the characters are paper thin. I feel like the writer was a bit lazy, and maybe went to the well too often with the references. Having characters live in Rivendell and drive around in the Cowboy Bebop is interesting, but ultimately it's just piggy backing on other writer's successes. If you are looking for an entertaining story that relies tremendously on nostalgia then check this book out. If you are looking for deep characters and non-contrived plots then seek elsewhere!

B0002KQNL8|5.0|Return of the living dead 2 is just as excellent or even better than the first one and is non stop fun and gore and not boring at all as with other zombie movies thats mostly about an army having a war with zombies. Most of this movie doesn't involve an army or soldiers just very little of it actually, instead young boys release a zombie trapped in a government contained barrol then the gas from that barrol turns other dead and decaying corpses in caskets and graves into zombies to the point they start to invade a neighborhood and get into people's homes. And some of the living people charactors are amazingly funny and whacky at times the way they become so insanely hyperactive and hysterical when encoutering these zombies in which some of them actually eventually turn into zombies themselves. It was so funny when they threw out a decapitated zombie hand out of a car and as it hit the road,the hand gave them the finger, HAHAHA. Many of the zombie effects are AMAZING and probably the best decaying zombies I have ever seen in a movie including a girl punchng a zombie in the face and his face becomes squished and a green goo comes out, a boy turning on a strong air pressure valve in a hospital that blows the decayed skin off a zombie's face, and an animatronic zombie head of a very old decayed lady that talks a few times in this movie and bites one of the guy's finger as he takes out her head from a carrying bag and its also funny the way some of the zombies often say \\"brains\\" and one even talks into a walkie talkie and another at the service desk in a hospital telling the young boy,his sister and the others to come to the hospital which adds some humor to this great,gorey and scary zombie movie. I think its my very favorite zombie movie along with Part 1, Evil dead 1 and 2, Shaun of the dead and Fido.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I bought the G2 (red version) of this in June and by September the battery would no longer work.  I was careful to follow the instructions and not leave in the battery in the charger too long.  I also had the original black one for several years before it died which I felt was reasonable for a $40 vacuum (and I was happy with its performance).  This was only lasted my 4 months and never worked as good as the original.  Based on the other reviews it doesn't look like the company will do anything about it.  I may try and return to bed, bath, & beyond where I purchased it from since I still have the receipt.  In the meantime I just purchased a similar one by Bissell from Lowes for $40 and bought the extended warranty for $7 dollars.  Lowes will replace the item one time if it breaks in the 2 years following the manufacture warranty and all I have to do is bring it back to Lowes.  I figured out there is a very good chance it will not last the 2+ years so the warranty was a good buy.
B002BWP49M|5.0|Just got home from seeing Breaking Dawn Part I at the theater... how soon can I get a copy so I can watch it again and again?    For me this has been the best movie so far. I know I shouldn't like these made for teens silly romance vampire movies(after all I am 55) but I just can't get enough.  I watched the movies so much I thought I must be missing something and bought the books.  After reading the books (and I have to say they are better than the movies, but that is always true) I went back and watched the movies again .. and again .. and again.  As soon as Breaking Dawn hit the theater I bought my ticket and waited anxiously along with everyone else for the movie to begin.  I was thrilled from the begining and left the show wanting more and wanting it now.  I don't know how I am going to keep myself occupied until Breaking Dawn Part II comes out next November.    This is a must see movie from start to finish.  Give me more.
B0047E6LW6|2.0|I should have listened to my instincts.  All those nice samples Amazon puts up are there for a reason.  I first listened to the Ghost samples 5 weeks ago and thought - huh?  Did I click Blue Oyster Cult by mistake?  Over the next several weeks I went back several more times to see if any or all of these songs would grow on me, yet I still was not enthralled.  Then yesterday I said `what the heck, just buy it' - if Hetfield likes them so will I - wrong.    I've listened to it in it's entirely 3 times since last night and am still wondering where the comparisons to Merciful Fate come from.  Lyrics about devils and witches does not equate to M.F. These songs are essentially mediocre pop songs with scary lyrics.  I admit they have their own sound, but  it's nothing to get excited about.  There are no jaw dropping Michael Denner / Hank Sherman guitar solos that make you truly feel the emotion in the music.  And if you want vocals to rival Kind Diamond, then keep looking.  All in all it's an OK album - some guitar parts have that early Judas Priest sort of vibe, which is never bad.  There are some parts that really sound great, but it still falls way short if your looking for another Melissa. Lesson learned - listen to the song clips and trust your gut instincts.

B004P1JDJO|4.0|As the title indicates, this book is about what motivates us to perform and the evolution of the underlying motivations as time progressed. The main concept introduced by Daniel is what he calls \\"the Motivational Operating Systems\\". In his own words these are \\"the sets of assumptions and protocols about how the world works and how humans behave, that run beneath our laws, economic arrangements, and business practices.\\" The author then goes on to explain the progression of this operating system: \\"Motivation 1.0 presumed that humans were biological creatures, struggling for survival. Motivation 2.0 presumed that humans also responded to rewards and punishments in their environment. Motivation 3.0, the upgrade we now need, presumes that humans also have a third drive - to learn, to create, and to better the world.\\"<br /><br />Despite the upgrade in the underlying motivational operating systems, Daniel argues that \\"most business haven't caught up to this new understanding of what motivates us. Too many organizations...still operate from assumptions about human potential and individual performance that are outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science. They continue to pursue practices such as short-term incentive plans and pay-for-performance schemes in the face of mounting evidence that such measures usually don't work and often do harm\\"<br /><br />A very insightful read on human behavior/motivation backed by years of scientific research. The book not only presents the concepts but also presents to us what its implications are from a management and leadership standpoint. Another great feature of the book is the summary and glossary of terms at the end. They serve as a great reference/refresher. A recommended read!<br /><br />Below are some excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- \\"Carrots and Sticks: The Seven Deadly Flaws - 1) They can extinguish intrinsic motivation. 2) They can diminish performance. 3) They can crush creativity. 4) They can crowd out good behavior. 5) They can encourage cheating, shortcuts, and unethical behavior. 6) They can become addictive. 7) They can foster short-term thinking.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"...For creative, right-brain, heuristic tasks, you're on shaky ground offering \\"if-then\\" rewards. You're better off using \\"now that\\" rewards. And you're best off if your \\"now that\\" rewards provide praise, feedback, and useful information.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"...Type I behavior emerges when people have autonomy over the four T's: their task, their time, their technique, and their team.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"The first two legs of the Type I tripod, autonomy and mastery, are essential. But for proper balance we need a third leg - purpose, which provides a context for its two mates. Autonomous people working toward mastery perform at very high levels. But those who do so in the service of some greater objective can achieve even more. The most deeply motivated people - not to mention those are most productive and satisfied - hitch their desires to a cause larger than themselves.\\"<br /><br />5- \\"Motivation 2.0 centered on profit maximization. Motivation 3.0 doesn't reject profits, but it places equal emphasis on purpose maximization.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"So, in the end, repairing the mismatch and bringing our understanding of motivation into the twenty-first century is more than an essential move for business. It's an affirmation of our humanity.\\"<br /><br />7- \\"When it comes to motivation, there's a gap between what science knows and what business does. Our current business operating system - which is built around external, carrot-and-stick motivators - doesn't work and often does harm. We need an upgrade. And the science shows the way. This new approach has three essential elements: (1) Autonomy - the desire to direct our own lives; (2) Mastery - the urge to get better and better at something that matters; and (3) Purpose - the yearning to do what we do in the service of somethinglarger than ourselves.\\"<br /><br />8- \\"Type I behavior: A way of thinking and an approach to life built around intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, motivators. IT is powered by our innate need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world. Type X behavior: Behavior that is fueled more by extrinsic  desires than intrinsic ones that concerns itself less with the inherent satisfaction of an activity and more with the external rewards to which that activity leads.\\"intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, motivators.

B005LRWRZ8|4.0|Well this one seems to be stuck sometime in between World Needs a Hero, and there's some elements of MD45 in here too, with its punk feel.  It has replayability, but doubtful I'll be humming along to anything here.  Its the kind of disc you play just to have some background noise in the house or car.    Dave - quit doing leads and fills please - they're not effective on this release at all (and reduce the pick scrapes - this is 2011).   I've been a fan since 1990, and I'd rate this in my bottom three Megadeth studio albums with Risk, and So Far So Good So What.  I've never been a fan of Metallica, so that argument was answered long ago in my mind.  This is what a Mustaine solo album sounds like.  EDIT:  Up to 4 stars based on more listens.  It really takes awhile to sink in, lotsa punk references here.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is simply a captivating,  can't put it down type of book.  The story and characters grab you and the suspense is relentless.  Can't wait to see the movie if/when they make one -- will translate beautifully to film.  But the book will still be better -- a great concept delivered wonderfully.
1439152799|2.0|This novel was defeated by a narrative that was too often derailed by description piled on in excruciating detail or too much resort to extended interior ruminations by the characters.  After a promising start -- Edie Burchill, driving in the English countryside, comes upon the old estate where her mother had been lodged as a child evacuee from London during the Blitz -- the story bogs down once Edie meets the three elderly Blythe sisters (the daughters of a famous author) who still live in the now-deteriorating mansion.  The two older sisters, twins, are vividly portrayed, but at the author falls into the trap of preciousness when she describes every nuance and twitch of these \\"old dears.\\"  And, when describing a room or other setting, she seems unable to leave out any detail, no matter how trivial or redundant.  There's supposed to be a many-layered story and even a mystery here, but the novel stalled almost completely long before it gained any traction.  I gave up after reading about a third of it, with a feeling of immense relief.

B004JN1CW4|5.0|The previous books in this series left me flabbergasted, and this one was no different. What a powerful ending! Like most dystopians, it doesn't end with everyone leaping for joy, but you feel safe leaving Thomas and his friends where they are. James Dashner is a mad genius!<br />  I'm always a bit nervous reading the last book in a series, worried that the author will do something completely wrong and ruin the characters. But there was no hint of that in this book. The characters were true to how they were portrayed in The Maze Runner. And though the events in The Death Cure take place only a couple of weeks later, I could see how they had grown and developed through their experiences. It did bother me how Teresa was much less involved in this book than in any of the others, but Brenda came in, filling her place.<br />Characters: 4.9 Stars<br />  The plot in this book took a completely unexpected turn! The future I foresaw was one of dreary scientific work for the Flare cure, but Dashner was able to keep the extreme action and suspense going until the very end, where you see Thomas and his friends safely settled, and finally--peace.<br />Plot: 5 Stars<br />  Those of you who have read the preceding books will understand when I guarantee-at the risk of sounding cliche-that these books will literally keep you up all night reading, and then all night thinking. James Dashner's books portray the thrill of mystery, the suspense of horror, and the touch of romance that made this book one of my absolute favorites.<br />Style: 5 Stars<br /><br />Rating: 5 Stars

B0067H9W72|2.0|The writing has taken a seriously boring turn.  None of the episodes in Season 2 speak of any urgency - to solve, to figure things out, to move forward.  The pacing is slow and all the characters' \\"problems\\" are getting surprisingly low stakes.    Glenn feels heartbroken after a cheap thrill?  Aren't there more important things to focus on?  Why does this take up so much reel?  And how did everyone get so comfy in the Apocalypse as to reduce their concerns to run-of-the-mill gossip matters?  Everyone really seems to be unnecessarily over-explaining their worries and moral dilemmas in this season.  Super daytime soap style.  We've been stuck at this same location, with the same dreary (almost now annoyingly dragging) issues:  Carl is healing and Sophia is STILL missing.  Is this the way it happens in the graphic novel?  The idea of being at this pit stop indefinitely with no significant character development and no action is more of a nightmare than dealing with the undead.  We haven't met any interesting people or had a worthwhile twist in plot since Shane killed Otis.    Plus, Daryl gets shot in the head from 50 yards out and is only grazed?  I can only suspend my belief so far.  So entirely over the top.  Would've been better if the bullet missed, everyone hits the ground (why did no one hit the ground with live ammo whizzing over their heads?), we see everybody give Andrea a serious piece of their mind for not following basic gun safety protocol, and then she gets her gun privileges revoked, including her precious pistol.  Now, she's gun-less in zombie land because no one trusts her to be responsible.  See???  More interesting AND realistic.  Instead, as it actually plays out, we only see her feeling sorry for herself.  That's it.  No repercussions whatsoever.  Just more unwarranted emoting.    I don't think I'll be buying anymore episodes.

B004BBDHEK|2.0|This album starts with two cuts that are traditional Yanni and then it goes..... I'm not sure where????  The tracks are all over the place in genre, and don't sound like the old Yanni at all but for a few songs.  You want Country Western, it's got it.  You want Bump and Grind, it's got it.  You want Jazz, it's got it.  You want Italian (maybe Greek) arias, its got it.  You want kick drums and midi, I think it's really got it!!!  There are indeed a few tracks that can be appreciated but most are after Yanni cut his hair and trimmed his mustache, and I don't think many Yanni afficionados will take to this CD.   Too bad. I really enjoyed the old Yanni and hope this isn't the beginning of the end for this once talented performer.

B00027JYLC|3.0|Under pressure from an influx of successful \\"monster\\" movies of the 1930's, Hollywood wanted more and turned to Tod Browning who had his own \\"monster\\" hit, \\"Dracula,\\" a year earlier.  Rather than use normal actors to remake unusual people with the help of makeup and costumes, Browning hired a cast of \\"little people\\" (called midgets, dwarfs in the film) as well as other physically and mentally \\"challenged\\" (deformed and worse in the movie) actors.  There are a couple full sized actors as well.<br /><br />I recognized long time character actor Wallace Ford in a leading role.  There are also some \\"little\\" actors that have appeared in films earlier including Harry Earles.  The story, adapted from Ted Robbins \\"Spurs,\\" deals with a revenge plot against a pair of circus performers who attempt to poison Earles' character.  He marries the beautiful and unscrupulous Cleopatra (Olga Baclanova) who is of normal size.<br /><br />Hans (Earles) runs the circus and is evidently financially loaded.  What makes the movie different and controversial is the cast of unusual accomplices.  For example, conjoined twins, a bearded lady, a skeleton man and an assortment of people without various limbs.  One guy is a dwarf with no arms or legs but gets from place to place by crawling on the ground similar to our reptilian friends.  Another guy has no body below the waist but gallops along just using his arms and hands!<br /><br />A masterpiece as many critics suggest?  I don't think so.  The acting is terrible. The plot is overly simplistic.  It's worth a look for its historical significance.

B001UV4XHY|1.0|I rarely write a DVD review, but I cannot help but tell people to save your money and not but this loser.  The numerous 5-15 minute conversations that said nothing; the reminiscing about how mom and dad died which they have touched on before many times; the break-out into a teen love story; the dance sceen between Harry and Hamiani at a most inopportune time; Harry going diving with his glasses on; but it was so obvious that the producers were trying to drag Part 1 out so they could cash-in on a Part 2.  I usually find the Harry Potter movies entertaining, but this one was a real bore! $3.00 for this dog is about right; remember, you get what you pay for.

It ain't what you do, its the way that you do it. This film does it pretty well, certainly, well enough to give the average viewer an entertaining 2 1/2 hours. Tough chief of a drilling company is asked in to save the world by blowing up an approaching meteorite with a nuclear bomb. The usual foul-ups, visual fireworks,  interpersonal fireworks, ensue.   Of course, Bruce Willis plays his role as The Boss with aplomb, Assorted character actors play as intended (not as lovers of fine art might like), heroism and love triumph, and a bit of tear-jerking works well. Not exactly avant-garde stuff, but hot dogs with sauerkrauant with mustard for the multitude.

1419702238|3.0|I guess it is quite possible that I will be one of the only reviewers here to say that I was not totally enamored with the latest Diary of a Wimpy Kid book.  The shame of it is that my kids and I were waiting for several months with bated breath for it, we tore open the box, tore through the book itself, and both my 12 year old son and I met back in the living room after reading and both said \\"yea it was ok but not great.\\"<br /><br />Yes the author Jeff Kinney does a good job inserting a bunch of super funny lines into the story.  The illustrations are as good as ever.  It is a quick read.  All of those hallmarks of the series are still there. However what it comes down to it, the humor is not as biting, the plot is not as thick, and the storyline just isn't as compelling as previous books.<br /><br />There were surely a lot of funny parts to the book and great scenes.  Kinney does a great job making the story compelling to kids and parents alike.  The part about Greg's school having the nut-free zone for lunch that nobody actually sits in until a kid with a peanut butter sandwich finally goes to in order to have peace and quiet during lunch is something parents can relate to with a grin (albeit not those with kids who have peanut allergies).  I had less than fond memories of shoveling snow for a few dollars just like Greg as I grew up in Chicago and as fast as I shoveled the snow kept coming down. And there was even a token look at the Loded Diaper van (although no cheese touching in this book!).  Overall though I came away from reading feeling like it was quite an average book which didn't really leave me dying for the next one to come out--although I am sure I will rush to get it for me and my kids when it does.
B004EPZ0AC|2.0|\\"Happy Feet 2\\" or the sequel to the animated musical for kids is absolutely beautiful. From the intricate fibers of hairs to the glowing jellyfish and the delicate wrinkles of nature escalating into giant land moving earthquakes, everything is like an i-max penguin nature film. \\"Happy Feet\\" was a surprise hit in 2006, and honestly, I was very surprised. A movie about a little penguin named Mumble, voiced by Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings), who likes to dance and is treated as an outcast because he can't stop tapping his feet, was a hit at the box office. His fellow penguins love to sing though, they just hadn't keened into the dancing thing.<br /><br />In the sequel, Mumbles is the father, and the penguins of the emperor penguin community are now keen on the dancing, along with the singing. Mumbles son Erik, voiced by Ava Acres, sort of runs along the same course as Mumbles did in the first movie. Embarrassed by an incident on his first attempt to dance, he runs away with two of his friends to find himself. Erik's dilemma isn't dancing, but flying. He wants to fly and he's given false hope by a bird posing as a penguin named Sven.<br /><br />The movie may start out on a similar course as the original, but it eventually turns into something completely different, in many ways. \\"Happy Feet 2\\" is less comedy and musical and more drama. Sure, there's singing and dancing, but nowhere near as much as the first movie. That being said, the finale's catchy rendition of Queen's \\"Under Pressure\\" was the best part of the film. Much of the middle of the film is bogged down with dramatic moments and slow moving scenes. As silly as I think dancing, rapping penguins can be and are, the middle of the movie could have used more choreographed penguins breaking and shaking like they were Usher or Michael Jackson.<br /><br />Robin Williams, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Pink also lend their voice talents to \\"Happy Feet 2\\", a movie that has its moments, including the finale, but for the most part it's slow moving and less interesting than most animated movies these days.

B004LWZW8I|3.0|\\"Immortals\\" is one of those movies that some may hate and some will love, but it certainly has some qualities that everyone will find appealing at least to the eye. Based on Greek mythology, \\"Immortals\\" centers around a peasant man, named Theseus, played by Henry Cavill, who is certain to be a big star in the making and is the title character in the upcoming Superman movie \\"Man of Steel\\". Theseus, is a man of no importance who was instructed in the art of fighting by Zeus himself, in his human form, all in preparation of an impending war sparked by King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke). Hyperion seeks a weapon forged in the heavens by Ares called the Epirus Bow. This weapon, and this weapon alone can free Titans, imprisoned within the walls of Mount Tartaros, Titans that will undoubtedly destroy mankind and destroy the world of the Greek Gods.<br /><br />So, that being said, \\"Immortals\\", as you can tell, is tailored made for the fantasy, mythological, epic loving movie patron. In the tradition of \\"Clash of the Titans\\" and similar, but not the same as \\"300\\", \\"Immortals\\" is designed from top to bottom with beautiful scenery, colors, costumes and epic battles. The battle scenes may be the biggest highlight of the movie. Although the battle scenes are violent, it wouldn't be realistic if they weren't, and quite frankly, most moviegoers expect that sort of thing. In the movie \\"300\\" slow motion and disbelief were elements used to portray how so few men defeated so many. \\"Immortals\\" uses those same slow motion elements, but there is nothing left to the imagination as to how these battles are won.<br /><br />The movie, directed by Tarsem Singh, who has displayed his talent quite brilliantly in such movies as \\"The Cell\\" and \\"The Fall\\", which won many cinematography awards, is gifted with incredible visuals from top to bottom. The mood and is ably captured and the actors are better than most you would see in movies like this, but \\"Immortals\\" isn't without flaw.<br /><br />Despite all the story elements that are in place, with oracles, bows, titans, battles, revenge, Greek gods and impending wars, the movie is horribly predictable and simple. Every move is telegraphed. When they tell you the significance of something, you know how it will play out and your first impression is the correct one. Finally, as epic as the movie is, and maybe much of it was shot on a green screen, but it seemed that in the entire movie, there were only 4 or 5 sets and they used them over and over.<br /><br />\\"Immortals\\" will visual candy and entertaining for the most part. The audience member looking to just take your mind off things for a while and enjoy a spectacle, you won't go wrong. If you're looking to be challenged or be on the edge of your seat, it won't happen. The movie isn't without merit, but it is only for some.hat are in place, with oracles, bows, titans, battles, revenge, Greek gods and impending wars, the movie is horribly predictable and simple.

B005HGKW6E|3.0|Tale focuses on a mother accused of harboring her son and his friends who were tied into the assassination of President Lincoln and attacks on other officials. In many ways it's historically accurate but it doesn't blend those facts well enough with story and acting and plotting. At times it feels on the slow side and there are several threads which are not satisfyingly completed. That said, it's a good enough film and especially of interest to those of the era or litigation style fans. Directed by Robert Redford and with a host of known actors and actresses: James McAvoy, Kevin Kline, Tom Wilkinson, Alexis Biedel, Robin Wright and Justin Long. It cost $25M to make but so far has only yielded a tad under $12M at the Box Office. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; HISTORICAL ACCURACY: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid November 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B minus.

B0034G4P80|4.0|I watched this movie on a whim, because I was bored, and I kept seeing the one battle scene in a commercial. Wow! The character development in this movie blew my mind. I can't decide who impressed me more: Chris Hemsworth in the transformation from glory seeking, self important, heir to the throne. to humble, cares-about-the-little-people hero. Or Tom Hiddleston as the tortured Loki, who really just wants to be his brother's equal, and struggles to fit into a society where he doesn't belong, without knowing why. The betrayal he feels when learning of his true heritage makes his transition to supervillain easily explainable. The weakest performance in the movie, in my opinion, was Natalie Portman. I have seen her in a number of films, and her performance becomes very...stiff, very fake when it comes to a romantic interest. (Just watch her interaction with Hayden Christensen in the Star Wars movies - it was the most unbelievable romance ever, and fairly creepy) The rest of her performance is....tolerable, but only barely. I would have rather seen Kat Dennings playing Jane Foster, because I think she would have made it more believable. Portman did not give me any reason to think that Thor would have been remotely attracted to her. I was rooting for the Destroyer to blow her up, but sadly, she was never really in danger.
0385534639|5.0|this book was by far the greatest book ive ever read. i spent about 3 days reading it and it was probably the most magical days of my life. if you liked the harry potter books, the twillight saga, or any books with magic and romance then this is the book for you. it talks about love and sacrifice for others. its just so heart warming. it keeps you on the edge of your seat. theres mystery, love, hatred, jealousy, and just magic. its quite amazing.

I'm not a big fan of Disney movies, but this one was really well done.<br /><br />As you can tell by title, I loved Rapunzel laying down the smacketh with a frying pan.

The guys in the inn were also great, especially the old guy in the diaper.<br /><br />Definitely pick this one up.

B0047FY6V8|5.0|First and foremost, I appreciate Justin's review and overwhelmingly agree with every word he  says.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the lack of an antagonist in this episode is what made it seems so refreshing?<br />Clark's destiny as a hero was being challenged and his own inner turmoil was being documented since the beginning of this season.<br />We are treated to a beautiful conclusive episode that gives us friendly reminders of how far he's come through reminiscing during his high school reunion.<br /><br />I can't say enough about how important this episode is to understanding what it is to be a hero.
B005HGKW6E|1.0|So take an interesting moment in American history, a group of colorful characters, pasteurize them, then make them 2 dimensional, dress them in period outfits, try to inappropriately squeeze in a reference to contemporary political events, add an awkward script and actors who can't maintain a consistent accent, spend $15,000,000, and you have this Robbie Redford movie. Just read Wikipedia about this moment in time and the key people involved in it and then see how they missed the boat. Don't waste you time and $3.99.

B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindlers list is about a German man named Oscar Schindler. He was a very wealthy business man. During the Holocaust when the Nazis reigned, he grew more aware of the terrible deaths that awaited the Jewish people. He decided to open a factory and he hired many Jewish people who most likely did not have a chance at life. People say that he opened this factory to hire Jews for cheap labor. If this theory is true, he had quite the change of heart. He did anything in his power to save as many of the Jewish people that he could. It is known that he saved about 1100 Jewish people. He devised a list of names of all the Jewish people he had encountered during this time period and that one list saved 1100 Jewish people from death. Unfortunately at the end of the movie, Oscar Schindler still did not feel like he did much of anything. He was extremely upset that he could not do more, that he could not save more peoples lives.  This movie in my opinion was heartbreaking but it was also heartwarming to see the good he did for the lives of those people.   This movie has a lot to do with world religions because during this time period, the Nazis were killing Jewish people because of their religion. The Nazis blamed the Jews for all of the things that went wrong in the world and said it was because the Jewish people were not Christians. It is terrible to know that such horrific things happened to innocent people because they did not practice the same religions. This is why I like the idea of coexisting. Obviously people did not coexist during this gruesome time period, but looking back at these events today, people have learned more about tolerance of other peoples religions.

B001NFNFNU|4.0|No matter what you think of Angelina Jolie's personal life, you have to admit that this woman can act. From the first scene of 1928 Los Angeles, to the final frame, I was captivated by this movie.<br /><br />As single mother Christine Collins returns from work, her nine year old son Walter is missing. The police department refuses her initial call, but eventually is willing to file a missing persons report. Five months later a child is found who fits a very loose description, but Christine knows that this boy is not her son and will not give up until her Walter is located.<br /><br />The corrupt police department refuses to believe her and begins to label her both a liar and a hysterical woman. Back in that day, when called hysterical, a woman would be locked up and treated to horrific conditions.<br /><br />With the help of a local minister, attorney and an investigator, all points converge on a ranch where a young boy tells a shocking tale of kidnapping, abuse and murder.<br /><br />There are a few continuity inconsistencies in the movie, but that should not take away from the story that this movie tell.<br /><br />The Changling, in part, is based off the true story of the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders.<br /><br />If you are interested in the full background story, please check out the Wiki page on this time Los Angeles history. A fascinating read.

B0067QPVJ6|4.0|Just your basic scary monster movie, a la 1950s. Our Heroine is recruited into an ill-defined Antarctic expedition, and they're off. They excavate The Thing from the ice and, despite thousands of years of age, it's not all that dead. Cue the paranoia, bring on the claustrophobia, and start the body count: one by one, the isolated scientists get picked off in increasingly gruesome ways.<br /><br />Well done, of its kind, it differs from most other flicks of this sort in that the polar temperatures mean everyone stays pretty well bundled up, so we never get the usual \\"vulnerability\\" scene of Our Heroine in her Haynes. Also, we never get clear explanation of why this peaceful little science outpost comes so well supplied with the military goodies used against The Thing. I'm not complaining, though. Kate (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) channels Sigourney Weaver's \\"babe with flamethrower\\" more than adequately. Fun to watch, but hardly one for the ages.<br /><br />- wiredweird

159562015X|3.0|Interesting book.  My one comment is that for folks who have worked with/used/been exposed to other models/tools such as Myers Briggs, LIFO, etc., then you may find this book a bit redundant.  Different model, but some of the concepts are the same.  Have also seen a lot of writing about one's \\"brand\\".  From my perspective, these are all good models, depemnds which one speaks best to the individual reader.  I also suggested that you not buy a used copy.  Apparentl;y each new book comes with a password that allows you to take an on-line evaluation.  The bought a used book, and the original purchaser had already used the code, so what I am left with is a book that talks about strengths, but I have no way to relate what is said to any results from an assessment.  Money not well spent.
B003VIW8DK|4.0|This is a very nice CD with music in many different styles that reflect the various stages of Ferry's career. So, if you like early Roxy Music or later Roxy music, or early Ferry solo albums, like Boys and Girls or later ones, there is something here for you.  And all the songs are good.  But...Ferry's singing is not great and over powering like it can be.  On most songs, he is singing in a whisper and is overwhelmed by the music.  So, while I like the songs, it just isnt the greatest performance by Ferry.  You have to wonder if he has lost some of the range to his voice.  This is kind of a throw back album of the 1980s, sized for the space limitations of vinyl.  There are 10 songs and the total time is 48 minutes.  The sound quality is excellent, except the part where Ferry's voice is overwhelmed by the music.
B005IZLPMY|1.0|I saw the first hour of this movie.  It was too slow and boring.    After having to adjust the volume AT LEAST TEN TIMES, because the dialogs were very hard to hear and the action was WAY TOO LOUD (no matter what settings I used), I gave up and took a nap.  BTW, i don't regularly take naps during the day, but this movie sure made me sleepy.  NOT RECOMMENDED!
B0052RDHTM|2.0|This is not what I expected from Follett. I am disappointed with Fall of Giants not just because it is so predictable, but because Follett's writing seems to have deteriorated into cliches and long winded redundant explanations of trivial matters.  He has written this first of a trilogy as if the reader is a moron who can't figure out the obvious.  I'm not talking here about our knowledge of history, I am simply saying that he adds too much where it is not needed. He has created characters that are watered down and just plain boring.  I'm finding myself rolling my eyes more than once at some of the scenarios. However, because I shelled out 18 bucks for this Kindle edition, I must see it through to the end.  To be continued...

Exit the Camel Club at Stone Cold like I should have done and spend your time and money elsewhere.

B003YL4L0W|5.0|I have been surprised by people who criticized this book for lacking a &#34;typical surprise&#34; or twist ending.  Um, isn't this the same writer who ended two of her most popular books with the convenient and improbable death of the major character who was causing all the conflict to begin with?  As for depicting all the gay or gay-sympathizing characters as saints, that also was no more the case than with any novel.  Finally I had to laugh at the frequent criticism that Picoult doessn't portray &#34;true&#34; Chhristians.  I'm sure thhat Fred Phelps considers himself the truest of Christians.  Funny how it's always the reviewer whose brand of Christianity is &#34;true&#34; and all others tgotally unrepresentational at best.  I gave this book 5 stars for being a good read but it is not great literature any more than any other Picoult novel.  I even agree with some of the criticism, e.g. Zoe's sudden reaalization thhat she's gay without any wondering or inrospection.  Still, it's just light fiction that's a bit ahead of the social curve (in 50 years people wouldd wonder what all the fuss was about, if they were still reading Picoult that is).  Readers should just relax and enjoy the ride, even though it IS improbable and more one-sided than Jane Austen... oh wait, she was too.  Okay, Dickens... um, no, hhe was as well.  Maybe it's just in the nature of Fiction not to be objective.  Ya think?  (Written on my Kindle so apologies for the typos.)

I had purchased Inception from Target on June 12, 2011 for $29.99. When I attempted to redeem the digital copy, I found it had expired on May 6, 2011 -- over a month before I had purchased it. I contacted Warner Brothers about what had happened, and the representative told me there was nothing I could do because they adequately posted the expiration date on the DVD insert, the redemption Web site, and on the box. Two of those methods are moot because you have to open the box before finding out the information. The expiration date is on the back of the DVD in fine print, meanwhile the  \\"+ digital copy\\" is in very large print on the front of the box. How many times do you look at the back of a movie before buying it?

B000G7PNAE|5.0|This album represents the peak in the musical career of Journey (together with Frontiers), where the band shows maturity and a sound quality hardly found again in other records.   The musical concept of this album differs greatly from its predecessor, Departure, leaving a seal in the new road that Journey was taking, in order to become one of the most successful bands of the 80's. It's better to listen it rather than talk about it.   I would say that it is easily one of the top rock albums of the early 80's.

B005EY2XFC|3.0|This is still a good movie. The look of it is nice in HD. Some of the CGI are a little sub-par for todays standards, but still do the job.  I have a real problem with the surround mix.  The center channel rocks throughout the film, maybe too much.  The big problem is the other channels.  Here and there throughout the film the surround just seem to cut way back.  The worst case is during the big shootout at the gangster meeting. It's gets so bad at points I was wondering if my speakers had cut out completely.  The center channel does great, the fronts, rears and sub all seem to cut back about 50% during the shootout.

B001QWBM62|5.0|A couple weeks ago I purchased a Zoom H4n digital recorder for just under $300.  This also happens to be the first and only handheld digital recorder I have used.      The specs on the zoom are impressive:  * 2 XLR inputs with phantom power  * USB interface  * 1GB SD card  * Built in effects   * The ability to record four tracks simultaneously (2 internal mics, 2 inputs)  * Unique X/Y mic design giving the user quality stereo images    The mics also adjusts from the standard 90° to 120°, which allows you to capture a wide-angle stereo image.  With the Zoom you can record in a variety of formats, from 24-bit to MP3 giving the user total control of quality and size of the files.       The versatility of the Zoom has really been useful.  I have used it for field interviews and to record a musical performance.  The result of both applications was very clean audio.  You can even mix-down your recordings with the built in compressors and reverb.        However, there are a couple small features that could be improved.  First, the LCD screen is small.  This is easily my biggest complaint.  Finding the right setting in a pinch can be a hassle simply because everything is so small.  Secondly, I have recently noticed that the battery door does not fit well and comes undone very easily.    Like I was saying, this is the first hand held recorder I have used, but I couldn't be happier with the product.  Everything about the device is solid.  If you're looking for a handheld with XLR inputs, The Zoom H4n is a powerful tool that delivers the goods and can fit in your pocket.
B004EPZ020|4.0|Saw this movie on opening night, I was very excited but also ready to be a little disappointed, luckily I wasn't. This movie really gave a better insight about why a demon has been following the family around for the past twenty years. I also understood the characteristics of Toby a little better than most (obviously) because I have an idea of how demons behave. Prey on the children and manipulating them while at the same time wreaking havoc, which really made the movie flow better, since it had a hold of Katie from the get go, but more violently than voluntarily with her sister. Overall, four stars since I did go WTF a few times during the movie and jump a couple of times (more because I'm sensitive to sudden loud noises than anything, but I'll give the movie the benefit of the doubt :] )

030788743X|3.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did. The concept sounded fun.  Then I got introduced to Wade and found him to be extremely self obsessed and hard to like.  Wade began to lecture to us about global warming and fossil fuels.  I almost gave up on the book at that moment.  I dragged myself through learning all the authors politics thought and found a book that didn't reward me for putting up with it.    The big problem for me is that Mr. Cline spent more time dropping 80's references and describing the virtual reality gear that we didn't get much detail on world.  We didn't get much more on the virtual reality world either.  Instead we got an essay on how to get a perfect game in Pac-Man and a list of movies from the 80's.  The book could do with some fluffing out to give us more depth.    At the end of the day, it is a decent read.  I would try another book from Mr. Cline.  If you are really into 80's pop culture you will enjoy figuring out all the references.  Otherwise, you might be put off by the constant interruptions to the story.  I heard they are making it into a movie, I have hopes that it will present itself better on the screen than on the page.
B00555X8OA|1.0|The kindle version of this excellent book is disappointing. Several features of the book are confusing in the ebook because the formatting is so poor. Tables with two columns run together because they are not boxed and the columns are only separated by one space. There are questions at the end of each chapter whose purpose is unclear until you see them in the real book, where they are set off in a box with a different type face. Most disappointing is the handling of the footnotes - they are relegated to the back of the book with no page number reference. There is few word phrase in the notes that corresponds to the place in the text to which the note refers, but it is up to the reader to scan the chapter to find the reference. The book reads like a mechanical translation of the physical book into a new format, with no effort taken to edit and format appropriately.  So the reader loses. With the price of the ebook almost as much as the real book, you will be happier if you buy the real thing.

B0067QPVD2|3.0|It's hard to criticize a movie like The Thing - the 2011 film by first-time director Matthijs van Heijningen - as it is in fact a good movie and very well done. And had John Carpenter never made his 1982 version of The Thing (which itself was a remake of the 1951 scifi/horror classic The Thing From Another World), then this would have been a great movie. But Carpenter did make his film and therein lies the problem.<br /><br />The problem is that, while this new film is written as a prequel to the 1982 film (and why couldn't they have come up with some slightly different name, btw?) and slavishly dedicates itself to that purpose, it does not for the most part add anything to the story. Certainly not enough to warrant an entire film being made. If you've seen the earlier film, then nothing in this prequel comes as a surprise. And if somehow you never saw the earlier film, then there's no real point to seeing it after the prequel as nothing in it will come as a surprise either. The bottom line is, this was a completely unnecessary film. The basic plot and events are exactly the same, just occurring a few days earlier in a Norwegian Antarctic base instead of an American Antarctic base. Which you would already know if you've seen the first film. Both the Carpenter film and this film are good movies and both are very well done - but we only need one of them.<br /><br />The plot, of course, is set in 1982, the year of the original film. At a research base in Antarctica, a team of Norwegian scientists, headed by Dr. Sander Halversen (Ulrich Thomsen), make an astounding discovery, buried deep beneath the glacial ice. Or two discoveries, actually. The first is an extraterrestrial spacecraft that apparently crashed on Earth over a hundred thousand years ago. And the second a body of what may have been one of the aliens from the ship, completely encased in - and preserved by - the ice. Determined to keep the discovery a secret but needing special expertise to research the body, Halversen recruits an American paleontologist, Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to join the project. The alien, whose outlines are just vaguely discernable through the surrounding ice, is transported back to the base where the scientists begin their research by drilling a hole in the ice to secure a small tissue sample. This decision has unfortunate consequences as shortly afterwards, while most of the scientists are celebrating their discovery, the creature bursts out of its icy confinement, incredibly somehow alive in spite of having been frozen for the last hundred thousand years. Alive, and as the scientists quickly discover, more dangerous than any of them could ever have imagined. The `thing' as they call it, not only attacks everything it encounters, its cells have the ability to mimic living tissue: it can become whatever it kills or infects. And suddenly the scientists are trapped in a paranoid nightmare: which of them are still human, and which of them have been replaced by the thing? Which is pretty much the dilemma of the first film, and so nothing that happens will surprise anyone who's seen the original.<br /><br />To its credit, The Thing does deliver the goods where the creature is concerned. The skin-crawling creepiness of its various manifestations and forms and the sheer grisliness of its attacks are on a par with what Carpenter's original provided in spades. And Winstead's Lloyd does come up with a clever way of distinguishing who's human and who's one of the things that is completely different from the blood test that was used in the original film. But only fans of the first film will be able to appreciate what the director and writer managed to accomplish in making this a true prequel. When I say that this version of The Thing was slavishly devoted to making itself a prequel, I mean it. Enormous care was taken both in the writing of the script and in the filming of the shots to reproduce in exacting detail the images of what the American team found when they went to the Norwegian base in the early part of the original. And the very end of the film - you'll have to sit through the ending credits to catch it - dovetails perfectly with the beginning scene of Carpenter's film.<br /><br />Without giving away any spoilers, I will note that the new film's makers did allow themselves a possible basis for another sequel (technically the Carpenter film counts as a sequel now, at least in terms of story) to this film. Whether or not it's made will probably depend on how well The Thing does at the box office.<br /><br />One final note - I would have to rate the Carpenter film as better than this one in two areas. The Carpenter film had a better musical score, done by the immortal Ennio Morricone. The new score by Marco Beltrami is not bad, but Morricone's bass-thrumming score lent an edgier tenseness to the earlier film. The Carpenter film also had better dialogue, and more humor, as exemplified in the classic line \\"I dunno what the hell's in there, but it's weird and pissed off, whatever it is.\\" On the other hand, van Heijningen's film does have one very funny dirty joke, related in Norwegian with English subtitles, that's so obscene I can't relate it here but is pretty damned funny nonetheless.<br /><br />And one final question - why is it that Antarctic research stations in these movies all seem to be abundantly supplied with flame-throwers? It's not the sort of thing you'd thing would be standard equipment for that environment, unless the alien threat in Antarctica is a lot greater than the new media would have us believe.<br /><br />If you've already seen Carpenter's The Thing, then I can recommend this film as a kind of filler-in for people who want to know exactly what happened in the events prior to the Carpenter film and don't expect much else. But if by chance you haven't seen the Carpenter film, then I would highly recommend you see at least at least one of these two films; it's just that there's no pressing need to see them both.<br /><br />But all that said, both films will still scare the living daylights out of you and probably show up in your nightmares.e Norwegian base in the early part of the original.

Rush never disappoints. The opener was quite entertaining, showing the sense of humor from a band who has weathered the decades well, maintaining virtuosic quaity to their musicianship. Endless camera angles plus 5.1 sound add up to a great live collection, one faithful to one of their best tours ever. I few extra photos in the booklet would have been nice, but definitely a buy for fans of all ages.  May there be an R40!

0062068423|3.0|Book Description<br /><br />Detective Harry Hole embarrasses the Norwegian police force during a U.S. Presidential visit so he is reassigned to the Norwegian Security Service as an Inspector (a promotion that gets him out of the way and is supposed to shut him up). Assigned to investigate what should be a rather mundane case, Hole instead finds himself getting embroiled in a possible assassination plot that has its roots in World War II--involving some Norwegians who served on the Eastern Front in the service of the Germans. Plunging Hole into the world of Norway's current crop of neo-Nazis and the men who served on the Eastern Front, he finds himself involved in a complicated case that gets more complex and confusing as time goes on--as well as threatening the lives of those that Harry holds dear.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />Although this isn't the first Harry Hole novel, it is the first one that was translated into English. Therefore, we're plunged right into Hole's world with little introduction. We quickly learn that Harry has a drinking problem, which he is fighting with the help of his brilliant young partner Ellen. The relationship between Harry and Ellen was the highlight of the book for me. Their partnership and banter felt authentic and livened up what was often a confusing read.<br /><br />The confusion part came mostly from the events that take place in flashback during the war. We learn of several events that concern a small contingent of soldiers on the Eastern Front, which we know is related to Harry's current case. Exactly how they are related becomes clearer as the novel progresses, but I personally struggled to keep up with everything. Nesbø gives his readers a lot of balls to juggle, and I confess I wasn't always successful in keeping them all up in the air. In fact, I was actually thinking of quitting the book about midway through, but I kept on. Part of my problem was the disorientation of being thrust into a series without being properly introduced to the main protagonist. Another was the Norwegian surnames (which was also a problem for me in the Steig Larsson books.) The other issue was the sheer complexity of the plot and my inability to hold it all together in my head.<br /><br />However, there were moments where I started really getting into the story, and I began to glimpse what might have attracted others to this author. I liked that Nesbø didn't choose to tell his story in a completely conventional way. At one point, each chapter is a series of answering machine messages. (This section was brilliantly done and really affected me emotionally.) So, although The Redbreast didn't set my world on fire, I'm willing to give Nesbø another try. The next book in the series is Nemesis, so I'll suppose I'll give that one a go before deciding whether to continue with the series. (For the record, the order of the series for the books that have been translated into English is: The Redbreast, Nemesis, The Devil's Star, The Redeemer, The Snowman and The Leopard.)<br /><br />Recommended for: Fans of complex police procedurals, readers looking for the \\"next Steig Larsson\\" (for the record, I don't think Nesbø is the next Larsson but I can see why people make that comparison)ther was the Norwegian surnames (which was also a problem for me in the Steig Larsson books.)

B002VPE1X4|4.0|This is a neoprene case (only a faint odor, no issues with that) that seems to be well made and will hold a small pocket vid cam, camera, or mp3 player.  It has enough padding to provide some protection, but not as much as a hard case would.  It has a belt loop and a hand strap.  There is a small compartment in the back you might miss at first glance, and one in the front as well as the main pouch.  The fold over top fastens via a Velcro fastener which is small and not as strong as it might be.  It did not open during my tests and may be adequate for normal use.  Good for quick access, but I prefer a stronger clasp.<br /><br />All in all, a decent value at this price and not a bad case for average use.

This book is much thincker than I expected and has kept me occupied for quite sometime (quite a feat considering the amount I read).

B005N1E8A4|5.0|Having attended 3 of Kylie Minogue's tours, I had an idea of what I could expect, especially since creative partner William Baker was to produce the show: High production staging, incredible costume changes, and great live vocals. As any uber fan, I followed the tour, via Youtube, on every single one of the 77 stops.   Given her latest work, [[ASIN:B003IPC5SO Aphrodite]], I knew that there had to be some sort of element of water involved. I was in awe of the way water was incorporated into the show; there were at least 3 pools of water in which dancers and aerialists were dipped by harnesses. Water jets were applied throughout the extended stage which would be queued to shoot during choreographed numbers. Prior to the tour launch, it was announced that The Fountain People, a company known for their water shows in several Disney resorts and the Bellagio fountain shows would be working on the tour.  The Greek theme was used throughout the show in costumes, staging, and props. Although the show was slow at times, the overall feel gave every Kylie fan their money's worth.   The show itself was directed wonderfully, as aired on Sky 3D overseas and in theatres. Also, in Kylie DVD tradition, a behind-the-scenes tour documentary entitled \\"Just Add Water\\" will be a special features addition.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|An amazing book, I bought it without reading any reviews, his track record and the low price were enough to sell me. So you could imagine my surprise when I read the negative reviews and how far off they were. These people missed the points of the book, but that does not mean you will. How helpful is it to you and how much credit should you give to a reviewer that says, \\"He was an insurance salesman. You can write your own joke here.\\" What is wrong with insurance salesmen? This sounds like fifth grade. If you are trying to be successful you need to listen to successful people, that is why John gives his credentials in the book, if he didn't then why should I listen to him. These people giving you a negative view do not understand this and say he is bragging and they have better advice. The old Proverb says: there are many poor people who will tell you how to get rich. The truth is John tells you how he became successful, this book is worth many times its price.

I was fearful because the comments about the low quality binding. The fears disappeared as soon as me and my wife opened the box and check carefully for the books bindings: They are embroidered! We can slide the pages without hearing any cracking sound. The printing quality is superior and the product arrived in perfect conditions. This is the 2010 re-print. I think they finally heard all those who complained about the bindings.

0307279189|4.0|Christopher McDougall was a runner on a mission.  How do you run - how does ANY person run - without damaging your feet, knees, hips, and spine?<br /><br />The answers, he believes, are tied to hidden running traditions, low tech equipment, an appropriate mind set, and the evolution of the human body.  The answers are NOT, he claims, found in expensive running shoes, sprints, and races that don't challenge a person's entire suite of muscles.<br /><br />I started reading this book when I was told (I may have misunderstood) that this book had some good running advice for distance runners.  Since I've just started trail running, and I am soon to undertake my first road marathon, I'm looking for all the advice I can get.  This book really didn't fulfill my needs.  It was more a tale of a unique individual going by the name Caballo Blanco, the \\"White Horse,\\" a Mexican tribe of runners called the Tarahumara, the history of some ultrarunners and ultrarunning races, and some theories about the evolution of modern and pre-modern humans (from H. erectus onward).<br /><br />I thought author McDougall was skillful in weaving these topics together in Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen. I sense he was exaggerating when he promoted certain running styles and equipment as injury reducing, but this wasn't a summary of current research.  It is a running tale, based on science and observation as interpreted through the eyes of a non-scientist.  For example, McDougall states \\"Natural selection is all about two things - eating and not being eaten.. (p. 223).  Natural selection is based on genetic-based reproductive differences, or, as the specialists at UC Berkeley write, \\"If you have variation, differential reproduction, and heredity, you will have evolution by natural selection as an outcome. It is as simple as that.\\"  Expect loosey-goosey explanations throughout.<br /><br />Still, as I stated earlier, the story was an interesting one, and I enjoyed reading it.

0307269981|5.0|In [[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]], readers are introduced to the most unlikely of partners, investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist and computer hacker Lisbeth Salander.  After more than a year apart, they reunite under the theme of disgust for people responsible for a sex trafficking operation in Sweden.  This time, instead of Blomkvist facing arrest, it is Salander who is accused of heinous crimes, and Blomkvist comes to her aid.  As you may remember from the first book, neither readers nor Blomkvist know anything about Salander.  In The Girl Who Payed With Fire, you will learn the deepest, darkest secrets of Salander, secrets that shape and define her.<br /><br />The detail of Stieg Larsson's writing continues to amaze me.  Great, great story.  Highly recommended.

B005OGYH90|3.0|I am a huge Slash fan so of course I bought the 3 disc special edition CD. I feel as though I was let down by the DVD. 5 songs on the DVD and I have yet to find the interview with Slash on the DVD. I guess it was somewhat my fault that I didn't read all the info and tracklistings but it's still very disappointing that the DVD has 5 songs on it. Regardless of whether I want to believe it or not, it makes me think Slash is becoming a sellout by not just including the full live performance.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this show. I never even knew it existed until my bro-in-law introduced me to it and created a deep love for nathan fillion. This show always makes me happy when i watch it or the movie \\"Serenity\\". Nathan Fillion just always cheers me up. I never got to see all of the episodes because it was canceled but netflix actually has them all online which led me to buy the series when it went on sale for fear of netflix taking my little bit of happiness away. Now i can have it forever!! YEAH!! :)

It is an all time classic and probably the greatest children's movie of all time so when I saw it coming out on DVD i knew i had to get it to share a part of my childhood with my niece and nephew. Also, admittedly I had to get a copy for myself too. It is one of those children's movies that you never outgrow and for everyone in the family.

I'd consider it a must-see if your state has gas deposits energy companies are looking for.  Not to say having another alternative energy source is bad, just that the new technology that explosively inserts millions of gallons of fracking water with tens of thousands of pounds of toxic and other unknown chemicals deep into the ground needs to be changed!

B0038M2AZA|5.0|I really loved this movie - and what is so cool about it is how people who don't fit in the box are basically excluded from society because they are different than everyone else.  But they often can see things other people can't see - and they experience the world differently than other people.  I have had many of the same difficulties and I found this movie to be very encouraging - I really liked the movie's use of the door and going through the door - and how nobody was willing to be kind and patient with her but then there was someone who was willing to be kind and patient and that was all it took for her to face her fears and do something she was afraid to do and once she did that then other doors would open up.  What I think is amazing about this is all it really takes to help a person is a few people who are willing to believe in you and to be patient with you
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|I was shocked at some of the negative reviews for what is a family/kids movie. lots more Mater, and my kids love the new characters. very enjoyable family movie that has been watched at least 20 Times by the kids thus far. My 2.5 year old can't get enough of it.
0545259088|3.0|More like 2.5 Stars.  Excuse the pun, but it took me \\"forever\\" to finish this book. I skimmed the last half of this book and was still able to keep up perfectly fine. I just couldn't get over how dull everything was. Here they are, faced with possible destruction, and nothing seemed to be happening. And when Grace finally becomes human again in Sam's bathroom, instead of running off to find the love of her life (that's Sam by the way in case you were wondering. Because with the way they acted around each other, who really knows!), she stops off for a casual chat with Cole first, and then when they finally do catch up, instead of the happy and emotional reunion that would happen had you not seen your partner in months, they're all like, meh, whatevs, and just stand there like complete and utter dorks. The only saving grace (excuse the pun) of this book was Isabel and Cole. They're just as emotionally scarred as Sam, and yet they had much more to offer in this story. Grace couldn't do anything, I'll grant that, but she fully had \\"the emotional range of a teaspoon.\\" And Sam was just moping around the entire time complaining about how messy Cole was even though he was the only one trying to find a cure so he could save them all and Sam could finally be with his girlfriend! Way to thank the guy, Sam!   Don't get me wrong, I loved the first two books. They were beautifully written and depicted a deep and meaningful love that couldn't be broken even under extreme circumstances. But there was a lot of build up to this third and final book where action had to be taken to save their lives, but it just never came through for me in the end.   I thought the book left quite a bit unanswered. How did they get on? Would the cure work? How did Cole get out in the end? What happened to Isabel? I just felt there could have been at least a little bit more closure.  Oh well...

1451648537|5.0|Fascinating read. Laughed out-loud, many times.  As prickly as he was, I actually like him.   The one thing that is truly puzzling, irritating and down-right dumb about his personality is the crying. Especially, the work related crying bull-crap.  It's something I really can't get passed to be honest.  It irks me to my core. So he was a man in touch with his emotions you might say?  Misplaced IMO.  There is no crying in the work-place.  Ever. Powell has got to be a saint.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I knowingly purchased this set for the Blu-Ray and DVD, and I enjoyed the film.  However, this Flixster/Ultraviolet stuff is a joke.  To access the \\"digital copy,\\" you're totally forced into a poorly implemented, locked-down streaming or downloading \\"service,\\" for which you have to give information like your complete birthdate to register (I just went through the process, which failed several times due to their site hanging up my browser), and then install software that who knows what it will get into on your computer (remember the Sony rootkits?).  However, anyone with any degree of facility with computers can make a drm-free copy of a disc to put onto a portable device, so this attempt to lock people into a proprietary streaming format will only encourage more people to use \\"illegal\\" (if you actually consider DMCA a valid law) means to put usable copies of their legitimately purchased movies on their portable devices.  Will the industry never learn?
B002BWP49C|5.0|I don't understand why so many critics hate this movie. Obviously they are not fans of the book. And, admittedly, the books are so terribly written, it's mind-numbing. But I love vampires and I have totally been drawn in by this story. The \\"Breaking Dawn\\" novel is my favorite installment in Stephenie Meyer's series, especially the first half of the book, which is what this film covers. And it's AWESOME! The lamest aspect of the film is the scene where the CGI wolves are all \\"talking to each other\\" in the woods. Very stupid. But the rest of the movie is great! Some people are saying that the film drags, but the first part of the book is really character-focused on Bella and Edward. There's no external drama for a change, except for the pissed off pack of wolves. And it's wonderful! Yes, I do wish the movie had been as graphic as the book. There should have been more sex and violence. But basically, this movie is ALL ABOUT sex and violence. What's not to love?! My understanding is that the producers needed to tone down a bunch of the graphic sex and, um, birth scenes so as to avoid an NC-17 rating or an R rating. (Hey, maybe they'll release the original cut on a special collectible DVD!) Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Except for maybe the first one, it's definitely my fave in the series so far. I can't wait for Part II!

0143039601|4.0|The book is a fabulous adventure on the pre-hippy, vagabond Buddha trail. However, it is one man's literary achievement. The author died from drinking too much booze for too long. So it's best to treat the book as a wonderful read, and not a guide on how to live.
B004T32SOK|2.0|When you do a search for Dropbox this App (Box) pops up.  Dropbox is totally free (also no ads) and it syncs with all your android devices, All your computers (apple or pc) and also syncs with and gives you a website to see all your files.  All this happens almost instantly (as fast as your net connection - anyway).  You can make files shareable on the net with others.  And you can even backup your entire android phone to Dropbox (I'm talking System files, Apps, photos, music and all).  Sure you may religiously backup your system and your apps on your phone using Nandroid backup or TI Backup to the SD card - but what if you loose your phone?  You lost the SD card too.  With Dropbox you can buy a new phone and then recover everything from your old phone right back on to your new phone.  So 2 stars since syncing is not free and Amazon won't put the app that will do it all for free on their site.  Starting to wonder if I'm going to see a lot more of NOT finding the great free apps that do it all for free and instead finding apps that try to appear to be the one you are looking for but with limited functionality and if you want the app to do it all - you will have to pay for it.

B00004VVNB|4.0|I first saw this movie when it came out in 1975-76....and I thought it was an interesting concept but it just wasn't something that could ever happen....purely science fiction.  Now, 35 years later, with overpopulation and overconsumption of our natural resources and the earth being affected by all of this and crime and well, you begin to think that the author may have been onto something.  But, then again, if you really think about it, our society has always had their own form of population control since the beginning of time....war, and not just military ground wars. Some wars are not so evident as they are disguised as viruses and cancers that kill people before they can reach adulthood... and the ones who do make it to seniors well, they just experiment on them with pharmaceuticals which ends up killing them anyway.  Now that I am an adult and see how things really are in life it's not such a far cry from Logans Run...similar to what we do....just not with that unitard looking outfit...not yet anyway.  A good movie and right on target about how everyone today is obsessed with looks and malls...after all, we do live in a self promoting society, not so different from that prediction (thanks to the advertising media) So, is it just entertainment or an accurate forecast of our future?  ...also with the new movie out starring Justin Timberlake this year (2011) called In Time ...there is some plot twist to the same effect....hmmmmm.....are they repeating movie history or are they trying to tell us something?
1451627289|4.0|When I first heard that Stephen King was writing a novel dealing with time travel I got very excited because I am a time travel-loving, Stephen King fangirl. I've been reading his stories for half my life (started at 13) and I love his style of storytelling. I'm not a fan of other horror/gore though, so it's always been a bit of an oxymoron. Basically, time travel + Stephen King = a literary dream come true for me.<br /><br />I loved this book. It was intriguing, interesting, informative, frustrating (in good ways), and it was very much Stephen King. He threw me for a loop several times, which is always a nice surprise when it seems like everything these days is utterly predictable. The main character is kind of an Everyman, though he definitely gains layers and definition throughout the story. I found myself trying to put a face to him a few times as I was reading, but I couldn't seem to do so. The task of going back in time to change an epic moment in history is lain upon him and the journey we take with him is as harrowing as it is fascinating.<br /><br />It's not perfect (what is?)- it's at times repetitive and slow- but it has all the ingredients of a great Stephen King book and my expectations were pleasantly met.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|The only thing that makes this app anything less than perfect is that if you try to type with two hands, you'll come up with many words typed incorrectly, because you'll find yourself typing faster than the keyboard can understand. Devs: if you're reading this, add multitouch support, or at the very least, add the option to decrease the delay interval between keystrokes. If one or both of those changes are implemented, I would so gladly adjust my review to a five-star one and begin using this app again religiously.  Some other small changes I'd recommend: wider space bar, theme customization.  Other than that, this is a very smart app. Nearly perfect.  -Tim

B004J4WKTW|3.0|I selected this book for the very good for the reviews. I found the story and plot lines were only OK. As the book went along, I had difficulty following the various plot lines. There seemed to be 4 or 5 stories interwoven, it was kind of like you were driving along a long oval highway, when the scenery would come by each time, you could explore more about the detail. And, the overall story unfolded very slowly. It was because of this about half way through, I did something that you can only do on a Kindle. I searched the book and followed the story threads of the five main characters to it's final conclusion. It was too difficult to plod through the book the old way.   The Kindle price is way too high at 12.99. It should be half the hard copy price.

B0034G4OQS|4.0|MOVIE NOTE #11: ARTHUR CHRISTMAS I went to see an Academy screening of this new Sony Pictures/Ardmen Production of \\"Arthur Christmas\\".<br /><br />Directed by first time animated feaure film director Sarah Smith (mainly noted for her writing and producing of British TV) and co-written by her and her long-time writing partner Peter Baynham (noted for his writting of such films like the new Authur, and the two BORAT films) - they embark on a very very old tale with a very new and exciting twist! Arthur (Voiced by X-Men:First Class's and Gnomeo & Juliet's James McAvoy) is the youngest child of what is now the Santa 'Dynasty'. For generations Santa Claus's yearly duties have been passed down, apparently, from son to son. The next son in line for the current Santa (Voiced by Harry Potter's own Jim Broadbent) is supposed to be Steve (Voiced by the always surprising 'House' star Hugh Laurie who also played Dr. Cockroach in the animated Monster'Vs.'Aliens) - but both Steve and Santa has some real issues - the meaning of Christmas and what Santa really is all about!<br /><br />The basic plot - SPOILER ALERT - one child is 'missed' - quite by accident - on Christmas Eve. The movie has an excelletly clever opening with the S-1 Santa Sleigh showing you how Santa presently deliveries 2 Billion presents in one night all over the world. The gags, the jokes, the stunts these elves perform are amazingly clever and funny. The traveling concepts from the new ship to the reindeer are also inventive. Then the film does slows down a bit for the first third and was a little thick in Britishisms....but by the 2nd act and completely through the end the film gains a momentous heart! We learn the true meaning of Santa through Arhur and his grumpy yet strainght-to-the-point 'GrandSanta' (his Grandfather voiced by the ever changing voices of Pirates of the Carabbean's own Bill Nighy) There are some great magical dust gags and some hysterical pet moments as well as an incredible heart warming feeling build up that Christmas is not just Santa and presents but that it all comes from the heart - even Santa's.<br /><br />Also you should note some of the talents voices that also appear as the many Elves in the movie - they include Michael Palin, Robbie Coltrane, Joan Cusack, Andy Serkis and even Eva Longoria as the chief of the Military (yes the world wants to attack Santa because they think he's an alien invasion - that sequence is hysterical) and Laura Linney as the North Pole Computer Voice. An amazingly fun, family and entertaining film - especially for the kids - but adults will walk out with a tear in their eye. Really. In speaking with the production designer Soviet born Evgeni Tomov (who also did the animated film The Tales of Despereaux') and the director - this movie was not intended to be in 3D, but the Studio loved its process and it's production and decided this would be a good 3D addition to their film library. This should definately become a Holiday favorite for DVD families everywhere!Christmas is not just Santa and presents but that it all comes from the heart - even Santa's.

B001UV4XIS|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but I had read the book. A person who hadn't, watched the DVD with me and was lost sometimes. I had to explain that the dragon which the 3 used to escape from the bank, was blind. Also, at the end of the book Harry tells Voldemort that love is what he is missing and what allowed Harry to survive everything. Voldemort never wavers. Missing from the movie. I thought that the movie was overdone using black, gray, and white most of the time. Ditto with the darkness at night in the battle scenes. A little would have been enough to set the tone and it was the unusual objects that we could see that fascinated us in the prior stories. Grawp fights the Death Eaters but is not mentioned in the film even when he is shown.  By reading the book first, I knew what was happening and what was about to happen. Without that insight I would have rated the movie a 2.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|OVIE NOTE #10: Puss N Boots. Directed by Shrek The Third director Chris Miller, the film tells the historical take of the origins of Puss In Boots as masterfully voiced by Antonio Banderis. I must admit I was expecting the sight gags and 'inside jokes' that all the Shrek films had - but this film dragged the story and scenes a little for me.<br /><br />It did have some great re-occuring gags and some sight tricks, but overall didn't have the character draw and strong story for me. Selma Heyak plays Kitty Softpaws, a very funny and extremely talented female version of Puss. Their chemistry is fun and some of the Dance choreography between both their fighting snd the dancing was quite fun and hysterical. Humpty Dumpty (Voiced by Zach Galifianakis) is the 'crux' of the story and as such isn't as dynamic as Puss and Kitty. However Billy Bob Thorton and Amy Sedaris play the irreverant and oddest couple of all - Jack and Jill. They are hysterical.<br /><br />The adventure is fun and once the quest gets moving - the film begins momentum. However, the ending was somewhat of a short one for me...a nice little nod to the Shrek world would have been nice, but I can see where there might be a sequal. Overall a fun family film - just not ahead of the crowd in terms of the animation films out there. Meow!

What a really well done photo-realistic, motion capture animated film That I saw tonight at a Pre-Screening at Paramount Pictures tonight in Hollywood. This film will not be relased until Dec 21, 20011 - but I was quite surprised as it was directed by Steven Spielberg himself. His FIRST animated feature as the director (and producer).<br /><br />Along with co-producer Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings, Kink Kong) and written by Stephen Moffet (Doctor Who, Sherlock), this film stars the voice talents of Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings, 13 Going on 30, King Kong (2008), Rise of the Planet of the Apes) as the extremely inebriated Captain Haddock who inadvertantly is guided on a massive treasure hunt invlving a sunken ship of his ancestry by the young reporter Tintin - voiced by Jamie Bell (Jane Eyrie, Jumper, Defiance). Accompaied by the most inteligent and funniest sidekick I've seen since Snoopy himself - a faithful fox terrier named Snowy, everyone in this film needs to stay one step ahead of the evil villian who is artfully voiced by the talents Daniel Craig (007, Cowboys and Aliens, Defiance).<br /><br />Overall the movie started a little slow for me, but toward the middle it becomes a romp of fun, comedy and adventure - with quick cuts, many near misses and a whirlwind of physical hapenstnaces that only a true animated hero could survive. Accompanied by a brilliant score who was composed by Spielberg's long time parnter, John Williams (Star Wars, Jaw, Schindler's List, E.T. Close Encounters, Saving Private Ryan) - which may have sounded a little too much like the Indiana Jones themes for me (but that is what this movie is - an animated Indiana Jones) - this movie is definately family fun for all. Keep an eye out for his one in December!

B001GCUER0|4.0|(Spoilers refer to Season One only)  Season Two of the ad-biz saga shows a marked improvement as the series' creators leave off most of the ponderous lampooning of previous times and concentrate on the in-office and out-of-office interactions of the principal players.  Female characters are more credibly drawn, and a few black portrayals are fleshed out into more than menial window dressing.  Even the smoking is not quite so frantic and widespread.    Don Draper now has more screen competition from the intriguing Peggy Olson, whose home life provides a basis for condemnation of the mores of post-Fifties society and the beliefs of the Catholic Church.  Compared to the first season, this criticism is subltle and implicit, though a good deal of air time is consumed by it.    In Season One, Peggy has become pregnant even though she has started taking birth control pills.  Despite a significant weight gain, she fails to realize she is with child until labor pains drive her to an emergency room.  The script never explains why she became pregnant despite The Pill or even why she believes she did.  A knowledgeable viewer might assume she was not told that the medication must be taken for a month to assure effectiveness.  It is difficult to believe, however, that the smart, savvy Peggy failed to read the instructions or took the pills incorrectly or haphazardly.  And, as for her lack of pregnancy realization, this also can scarcely be related to a lack of intelligence or common sense.  The phenomenon has occurred with other women, usually due to irregular or almost non-existent periods.  Probably, it is supposed that the audience will blame a pre-sexual-revolution society, implying that Peggy is ignorant of the symptoms of pregnancy.  It cannot reasonably be a thing of guilt with her, since she took so readily to the  give-the-boys-whatever-they want attitude instructed by office-manager Joan.  As the second season makes abundantly clear, though, the Catholic Church has andcontinues to have an impact on her life.  The worst thing about the second season is the sex, which has become more sordid, anonymous, and perverse.  Draper's episodes of adultery, as well as other hollow time-fillers, often seem to be little more than tiresome opportunities to showcase him in undershirts, shorts, swim trunks, or sheets.  One scene involving a lead female is so unlikely and surrealistically staged that many viewers probably expect to ultimately find it to be presented as fantasy.  For the series' creators, it probably represented the ultimate in toilet-stall sex.
B005COO1X6|3.0|This is actually my first Stephen King book (I know, I know). I know that Mr. King is usually noted for his horrific stories that often make you think. This book does neither, however it is an entertaining read. I also applaud Mr. King's interest in bringing the short story \\"back\\". I do look forward to delving in his more in-depth work, hopefully it will a bit more frightening.

1596432594|5.0|Feynman, a graphic novel written by Jim Ottaviani has the power to excite and educate the minds of interested youths and adults alike.<br /> Jim Ottaviani has created an accessible text that does justice to the science and unique personality of Richard P. Feynman (1918 - 1988). The art by Leland Myrick skillfully conveys in a visual format many hard notions of quantum mechanics and portrays the many giants of modern physics who crossed the path of Feynman, and the colouring by Hilary Sycamore in this stunning graphic novel is at times vivid, always varied and often employs soft hues. Feynman, a book suitable for Junior High or High School students, serves as a fabulous primer for quantum mechanics and QED. Ottaviani, to my mind, has wisely left the more salacious adulterous elements out of the text, to make the book child-friendly, a highly worthy goal. The interested adult may find a full treatment of this very human but less palatable aspect of Feynman's life in Genius by James Gleick.<br /> This fine and rewarding book on Feynman deserves to be in every Junior High Science or High School Physics class room and in the home of any parent who wants to instill in their teenager a love of science, as the father of Richard P. Feynman did with such notable results.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|I am used to using sharpening stones, so it's possible that I am using this incorrectly.  I read the instructions, and followed them.  It messed up every blade I tried.  From kitchen knives, to swiss army folders, to my new Buck knife - all of them were worse off.  I will admit that the diamond sharpener is useful for serrated blades, but that's about it.  Even a cheap whetstone from the hardware store will serve you better than this.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I just recently bought this controller and I was actually surprised about how good this controller is! The first game I put this controller to the test was COD Black Ops. I did not like the feel of controller at first, but two Team Death Matches in to trying out this controller, I actually started to like it more than my official PS3 controller.  PROS: The buttons light up, so that helps me see buttons a little bit better while playing in the dark. The grip on the controller was a nice addition, whenever my hands got sweaty from playing so long my hands would never slide around. The Triggers are way better than the PS3's. They had a really a nice feel to them while pressing down.  CONS: The analogue sticks are a little too far apart, but I eventually got used to it. The X Circle Square Triangle buttons are a little far from the right analogue stick, but I also got used to that too. The analogue sticks have a dip at the top of them to help cup your thumbs, but as I started play longer I felt like they were digging into my thumbs.   Some people said that there is a dead zone in the analogue sticks, but it is a small dead zone that really didn't bother me. It actually kinda helped me while playing COD, but that's just me. When I try get a steady aim, I tend to move my thumbs a little too much ha ha. When I got my aim, I was able to keep it steady because of the small dead zone.  OVERALL: This is a great controller! I actually prefer this over my original PS3 controller. I did get used to some of cons of this controller, so some of those cons weren't really cons for me. It's just things I noticed about the controller when I was first playing with it. I really love the weight and feel of this controller, it does not feel like a crappy third party controller;) I really do recommend this controller! I hope I have helped you out a little ha ha

1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson has masterfully combined his journalist's instinct and insider's access with a discerning eye to craft a masterpiece.  He presents the entire Steve Jobs - genius and tyrant, artist and businessman, narcissist and visionary.  And, he is able to do this without seeming judgmental or reverential about the most interesting inventor of our age.  He engenders sympathy, awe, disgust, admiration and condemnation in appropriately measured doses as he traces the life of this most remarkable man.    Though I never met Steve Jobs, I feel I know him well - and not just one side of him.  The brilliance of this book is the depth of character that it reveals by witnessing every facet, no matter how unlovely or perplexing.  It is not just the best book written about Jobs, it is the best book published this year.

1451627289|3.0|The notion of time rifts in the form of small \\"bubbles\\" was a facinating premise and King's prose is, as always absorbing.  But I expected much more from this book.  Over 3/4ths of it, I'd say, was a lead up to that fateful day followed by an all too brief aftermath and wrap up.  Seriously.  We spend page after page and chapter after chapter in this quiet little Texas town, endearing ourselves to rather ordinary characters.  That and watching our hero stalk Oswald around Dallas/Ft Worth.  Then, when we finally get to the part we've all been waiting for, poof.  It's over.  Of course we boomers have been wondering all our lives how things would have been different if Kennedy had lived.  How would the civil rights struggle evolved? Would Kennedy have been re-elected? Would he have escalated the conflicts in SE Asia? What about the Great Society, would anything like it have been pushed through without LBJ's arm-twisting from the oval office?  Women's reproductive rights?  Would the moral majority have sprung up and pulled the republican party so far right?  Would our path with Kennedy have veered away from these and other social currents and if so, where might it have taken us?  King gives us a bare glimpse at what we came for, a very brief passage and then the book is over, aside from an highly sentimental closing tug at the heartstrings. I wish he's given us more.

1451627289|5.0|At some point in our lives, we all have thoughts about how nice it would be to change the past. Some would like to change a relatively minor event that affected their own life. Others would like to change a large historical event that changed the course of the world. Into the latter, the two biggest events many would like to change would either be the rise of Adolf Hitler, or the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. There is no question that Kennedy's assassination was a hugely pivotal event in the course of American history for numerous reasons. The United States in 1969 would have looked radically different had Kennedy lived. However, as to how different, we can only make guesses, and ultimately we will never know. But it is one of those fun things to guess about. The \\"What if\\" question has the unique ability to sometimes be more engaging than the actual reality of things.   Stephen King's latest novel decides to look at the the pivotal event of 11/22/63. The story is told from the perspective of Lisbon Falls High School teacher Jake Epping who has the fortune, or misfortune (depending on your point of view) of being shown a rabbit hole that exists in the back of Al's Diner by none other than the owner of the diner who has already used this rabbit hole for his own benefit. This hole takes the person who uses it back in time to September 9, 1958 at precisely 11:58AM. Whatever is done in the past will make changes to the present. How big and how small those changes are depend greatly on what the person who goes back does. The problem is that there is simply no way of knowing beforehand what those changes will be. When the person comes back to the present, regardless of how much time has been spent in the past (a day, a week, a month, or years, only 2 minutes pass by in the present) Of course the real kicker is that if you have made any changes and come back to the present, if you decide to use the rabbit hole again, everything resets completely. The only way to keep the changes intact is to never use the rabbit hole again. With that said, I will go no further into plot details at the risk of spoiling anything. The one last thing I will say is that at the request of Al who has a final wish, he begs mild-mannered high school teacher Jake Epping, to go back to 1958 and stay in the past till November 22, 1963 in order to stop the assassination of President Kennedy. Jake accepts despite misgivings, and assumes the new identity of a one George Amberson. It is with this decision that Jake's journey begins.   Some reviews have mentioned that the book is long and slow-paced. This seems to be a drawback in the eyes of some readers. I do not know if these readers are new to Stephen King's work, but one of the central themes to King's works is the concept of the journey. For those who have read The Dark Tower series completely, they will know what I mean about the journey. The journey is what makes 11/22/63 so thrilling. The journey starts in 1958, but as the clock is winding down to that fateful day in Dallas in November of 1963, I felt my heart begin to beat faster. You simply do not know what is going to happen, and how things are going to turn out for Jake/George. In reading this book, while I do feel the ending is important, one must not lose sight of the journey itself because the journey has so many wonderful things occur. It is not simply a story about trying to stop the murder of Kennedy, it is also a story about courage, strength, faith, despair, love, sadness, and redemption. This is what makes the story truly magnificent.   Stephen King is masterful once again in his character development...so much so that by the end of the story, one cannot help but feel as if they know Jake/George intimately. He feels like a living, breathing human. While some like to point out King's weaknesses in his writing, he has a unique gift in simply creating worlds that suck you in, and feel like real places with real people. He has the ability to create \\"everyman\\" characters that is unparalleled in fiction. He revisits the horror of that lovely setting for his novel It; Derry, Maine. I felt genuinely unsettled by revisiting that city. There is very little good about Derry, as many familiar with it know. The revisiting of certain characters from the past novels was such a welcome surprise. Stephen King has created an interconnected universe throughout many of his novels, and 11/22/63 pays it's respects to those long time readers who have traveled with King over the years. It does not disappoint one bit.   The other large theme of the book is if one were given the ability, is changing the past the smartest thing to do? I could certainly write a book on this subject, but for obvious reasons I will not. In thinking that changing the outcome of an awful event into something positive, one may find they get more than they bargained for. Things are not always what they seem, and we sometimes lose sight of this when wishing we could change the past. We assume that changing one event would lead to the outcome we most desire, and there is a saying about the word \\"assume\\" that I am sure will come to mind for some. Sometimes the healthiest thing to do is to make peace with the past and accept what happened regardless of the outcome being favorable to us individually, or as a group. This idea I believe is a natural consequence of Stephen King's own encounter with death on June 19, 1999. That was a huge turning point in King's life, and I am highly thankful he did survive because he is in my eyes a true treasure to books.   The last point I would like to make is that this book will no doubt make people wonder if Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone shooter, or if there was indeed a conspiracy. King makes his view known after the story is over, and I tend to agree with him mostly because I came to a similar conclusion years ago. Kennedy's assassination was a random event that people have tried to make sense of inthe near 50 years since his death. Sometimes the simplest explanation is the right answer ala Occam's Razor as King mentions. Many historical events are just random, it is sort of like the signs you see on highways encouraging commuters to leave 5 minutes earlier for work so there is no rush to get there...a few minutes can make a huge difference in the outcome of various things. It comes down to nothing more than chance, and there are no hidden meanings behind anything. We as humans complicate things that are not complicated. But the great thing is, we will never know with 100% accuracy if there was something more to the events of 11/22/63...unless of course someone finds a way to travel back in time. :-)   If you are still reading this, please, do yourself a favor and read the book for yourself to see what conclusions you come to. Enjoy. :-)
0571283578|1.0|I'm no deconstructionist; what Jane Austen says, goes. From that point of view, this book is replete with errors of \\"fact,\\" or of \\"fict,\\" if you will. To give only one example, Mr. Collins is called Mr. Bennet's nephew; in fact, he is Mr. Bennet's cousin. I found three such errors in as many pages.  These irritants to a Janeite would not be fatal in a rollicking good read. Unfortunately, we don't have a rollicking good read here. The mystery angle is in some ways incredibly obvious; the reader guesses parts of it immediately. Other parts are totally unknowable, and come into the \\"had-I-but-known\\" category. No clever reader can figure them out, as can a really clever reader of Agatha Christie. With Christie you generally kick yourself for having missed the obvious. But, in this book, at least, James cheats.  The comedy-of-manners angle is a terrible disappointment. James presents two suitors for Georgiana Darcy's hand, but there is virtually no conflict. No pride. No prejudice. No mixed feelings. Georgiana likes the obviously likable young man best, and there are no red herrings that seem to point to him as the murderer, and no stains on his character. The other suitor is wholly uninteresting except that he does some seemingly inexplicable things after the murder. But he's not guilty either, and, anyway, Georgiana likes the other guy. No surprises. There is no witty dialog,  there are no obervations on the human condition, no noshing, no dancing, no hidden agenda. It's as dry as dust.   I have no ax to grind. I really am sorry to say this. I thought James would write a great P&P sequel and I took the trouble to order this book from England so I wouldn't have to wait for American publication. I can't recommend it.

0451160916|4.0|This book was one of the best novels I've read until it got to the climax. Up until the point - heavily foreshadowed - when Jack Torrance goes on a homicidal rampage, it was an outstanding portrait of male violence, depression and shame. Shame, most of all. Stephen King hit the nail on the head with this one. In the early stages of the novel the telepathic son, Danny, confides that he has read the word \\"DIVORCE\\" in his parents' minds. This is a result of Jack breaking the boy's arm in a drunken brain snap; his mother is horrified. But behind that word \\"DIVORCE\\", in his father's mind lurks another word: \\"SUICIDE\\". This was the point where I became hooked. And from what I've read about domestic violence, the male aggressor usually does mean it when he promises that he'll be destroyed if his partner leaves him. Shame, horrible self-pity, self-hatred. This all made so much sense.   As the novel goes on you get incident after incident of Jack getting angry and snapping at his wife. Viciously angry (the only part that Jack Nicholson really does well in the movie, imo). She annoys him, she unwittingly pokes his sore spots, and he sees red. It's realistic and you feel the potential for the final eruption into murder building beautifully.  But then King crashes. Badly. It's like he loses interest or got tired writing it. Or, maybe, he didn't want to say too much because his wife and children would read the final draft??? It's such a disappointment, because he'd set it all up so well. But the final descent into homicidal madness simply makes no sense. I was bored by the last two hundred pages or so. The ghosts made him do it? Please. We deserved more than that, Mr King!  No, I can't bee too ungrateful. It was a novel well worth the read for that excellent lead-up. Definitely scared me in parts too.
B004V6MWFU|2.0|I didn't care much for this album; I know some people think it's awesome, but I thought it dull, overtly simple and repeticious.  I was expecting more, in particular, gentle nuances unique to the ukulele that just weren't there.  After all, the name of the album is \\"Ukulele Songs\\" but there's nothing much ukulele about them.  Rather, the cover art reflects the somber, brooding, murky nature of the music within.  If that is your cup of tea, you'l like this.  But for me, the tea was cold and could've used a lump of sugar.  There are two songs at the end that are good, (not Vedder's creations), that merit a second star.  Otherwise this would've gotten just one.
B005J4TLN4|4.0|What a totally fun and refreshing version of the same old the alien monsters are attacking us genre. The \\"heroes\\" are an unlikely bunch of teenage thugs in a rough part of south London. No one messes with them--not even the faceless aliens with glowing mouths.   I really enjoyed the different take on the alien invasion story.  Our teenage hoodlums attack a young lady as she is walking home down a dark street. They surround and terrify her as they demand money. It's a scary scene--even one's worst fear--but things take a turn for the worse. The mugging is interrupted by an old explosion next to them. No one is prepared for what just arrived next to them.  Although it is a night full of fireworks, some of those balls of lights falling to earth are not fireworks. It's a good set-up. The aliens are landing during fireworks. They aliens are landing in small individual vehicles but why in this part of London? It eventually becomes clear that are actually attacking one large building - council block (or rather a large apartment building for mostly low income people). It gets even more specific as it becomes clear the aliens are all after our group of teenager hoodlums. The reason becomes clear later but the build up is great fun.  The young cast members all play their roles with delight. We even get insight into their backgrounds and home lives. The cast of unknown actors is fantastic. They add a total realism to the film. These kids have to find a way to save themselves and hopefully the whole planet.  Note to the monsters from outerspace. No one messes with these kids!

B00127RAJY|4.0|I had been trying different home workout systems (mostly by the Firm) for several years before Jillian was recommended to me.  Her workouts were the first that really worked, providing notable toning results.  The 30 day shred is very intense.  It has three routines - one easy, on 'medium', and one hard.  Each routine has three circuits, with each circuit having 2 strength moves (one for 30 seconds, one for one minute, then repeat each again), 2 cardio moves (30 seconds each, then repeat), and then 60 seconds of ab work.  The workouts are supposedly 20 minutes, although they tend to be 25-30 minutes long.  All three workouts are intense, and they can be hard on your joints.  There are a lot of lunges and squats, so you need to make sure your form is correct.  The cardio, especially on level 3, has quite a bit of jumping.  Jillian provides some modifications, but for some moves, she doesn't give you a non-jumping option.  Again, make sure you always land lightly, with your knees flexed to cushion.  Level 1 starts with some basic moves (pushups, jumping jacks, etc).  Level 2 builds on this, putting in some very strength-intensive moves.  It's a bit less cardio and jump intensive than level 3, but I think it is probably just as hard. Level 3 is very cardio intense, with modifiers for most of the hard moves.  The series is wonderful in that it produces results.  It is hard, though, so don't be discouraged.  Stick with it, and it will give you results.

B003L1ZXCU|5.0|To call this science fiction would be an insult to the modern world.  This book and its sequel opens the eyes to the weaknesses of our antiquated popular philosophies, what could ultimately happen to correct them, and what is happening, albeit at a slower pace.  Its amazing in every way.  Out with out olde, in with the new.  Bye bye Crichton.  I'm reading Suarez!
B005UT29Z0|3.0|First of all, I will say that the cast of this film is a pretty impressive one. Kevin Spacey gets top billing, but most of the characters are portrayed by folks with lengthy lists of acting credits, oftentimes pretty high profile. I found it interesting that they would all be drawn to a film like this that isn't super high profile. Demi Moore plays the one female character of note.<br /><br />So as not to spoil things for those who intend on watching the film, I'll just say the plot is basically one where a major financial firm finds itself in a bad spot in terms of mortgage security holdings and has to work its way out of it. Actually, the story is that simple and straightforward. No major plot twists. There also isn't too much in the way of high level quant stuff aside from a VAR reference, though there could easily have been (for better or worse, depending on your point of view). There did seem to be a reference to the so-called formula that killed Wall Street, but only in passing.<br /><br />I was tempted to call this movie a morality tale, but that's not really a good description. The story's major tension is one of character perspective and turmoil between the idea of doing what needs to be done for the sake of the firm (at least as they see it) and the impact that could/would have in the broader scope. There is no real attempt to provide a \\"right\\" answer, though. It ends up being more a question of characters working through their own issues.<br /><br />Overall, I found the film a bit plodding and lacking in the kind of tension and drama that pulls the viewer through to the conclusion of movies like Wall Street (the original, not the sequel) and Dealers. This one ends with a bit of a whimper.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|This album has an R&B feel to it with Playa, SWV, Jon B. and others in the background to his music. I love the fact that he's not our \\"normal\\" rapper.. He's sexy with his music and from beginning to end this album is good.. Love Drake
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I got this sharpener because I am planning on doing some hiking this coming spring and summer, and I have purchased a Gerber knife to throw in my back pack \\"just in case.\\"  I got the sharpener to basically keep with the knife, again, \\"just in case.\\"<br /><br />When I got the knife, I was a bit surprised by how dull it seemed out of the package.  A couple of passes through the PP1 and it was like a different animal!!!<br /><br />The PP1 is small, light, easy to use, and does a fantastic job of sharpening both quickly and with little effort.  I also used the rod sharpener for the serrations in my knife, and that worked well also!!<br /><br />Overall, a great product!!!
B0043URV5U|5.0|He has sold more than 50 million records worldwide.  During the ten year period between 1977 and 1986 Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band amassed an impressive total of 6 consecutive Top Ten albums while at the same time placing a string of 16 singles in the Billboard Top 40.  All the while Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band were packing 'em in in arenas all over America.  I always thought it extremely peculiar that his record label of more than three decades Capitol Records had never seen fit to issue a true anthology of his biggest hits and most popular recordings.  At long last Capitol has corrected this oversight with the impressive two disc collection \\"Bob Seger: Ultimate Hits -- Rock & Roll Never Forgets\\". It seems to me that it was definitely worth the wait.<br /><br />To begin with you will find each and every of of Bob Seger's seven Top Ten tunes in this collection including \\"Night Moves\\" the song that made him a star back in 1976.  Also included are memorable hits like \\"Still The Same\\", \\"Shame On The Moon\\", \\"Against The Wind\\" and 1987's \\"Shakedown\\" from the motion picture \\"Beverly Hills Cop II\\" starring Eddie Murphy.  That song was both an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominee for \\"Best Original Song\\" that year.  Now oddly enough the most popular Bob Seger song of all-time was not one of his biggest-selling singles.  \\"Old Time Rock & Roll\\" was initially released in April, 1979 and made its way to #28 on Billboard's Top Pop Singles chart.  A few years later in 1983 Capitol re-released the single when it was featured in the Tom Cruise film \\"Risky Business\\".  This time out it only made it to #48 on the charts. But \\"Old Time Rock & Roll\\" spoke to people across the generations and went on to become \\"the most played song ever by a male artist\\" and ranks #2 on the list of \\"Top 40 Jukebox Singles of All Time\\".  Pretty impressive for the man from Dearborn, Michigan.  And of course you will find that one in this collection as well. I was also extremely pleased to say that Bob Seger's raucous 1968 debut single for Capitol \\"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\\" was also included in this set. If you have never heard that one you are in for a real treat!<br /><br />But make no mistake about it.  Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band were much more than just a singles band. They sold tens of millions of albums for Capitol and in the heyday of \\"live\\" concerts in major arenas were consistantly one of the biggest draws in the country.  \\"Bob Seger: Ultimate Hits -- Rock & Roll Never Forgets\\" Includes many of those fabulous album and concert favorites.  Enjoy once again terrific tunes like \\"Her Strut\\", \\"Rock and Roll Never Forgets\\", \\"Turn The Page\\" and \\"Katmandu\\".  There is also a \\"live\\" version of \\"Beautiful Loser\\" which just might be my favorite Seger song of all-time.  Toss in some more of those great singles like \\"We've Got Tonight\\", \\"Hollywood Nights\\" and \\"Like A Rock\\" and what you wind up with is a pretty darn impressive 26 track collection that you are sure to enjoy for years to come.<br /><br />Passionate Seger fans might quibble about one or two of the track selections.  Personally, I would have liked to have seen the rockin' \\"C'est La Vie\\" from the original 1994 \\"Greatest Hits\\" album make the cut but it did not.  Perhaps one or two of your favorites are missing as well.  But on balance I thought the track selection for this anthology was outstanding.  All of the songs on \\"Bob Seger: Ultimate Hits -- Rock & Roll Never Forgets\\" have been lovingly remastered for your listening enjoyment.  In addition, the folks at Capitol have included a handsome 24 page booklet featuring photos, press clips and all of the lyrics to boot.  At long last Rock & Roll Hall of Famer Bob Seger has a collection worthy of his considerable contributions to the American music scene.  This is both well deserved and long overdue. \\"Bob Seger: Ultimate Hits -- Rock & Roll Never Forgets\\" would make a great gift for that baby boomer in your life.  Very highly recommended!ded!
B004L07KWQ|5.0|My girls call this \\"shake the screen\\" because they love drawing and then shaking the screen to clear it.  Its easy and entertaining for them and easy to use.  Every time you pick up your finger and draw something else, it changes the color you draw with, making for some interesting and colorful pictures.  If you put two fingers down at the same time, it makes some very colorful and amazing line art.  Just try it and see what you come up with!  You can save the pictures too, although we haven't used this because the kids would rather just \\"shake the screen\\" and move on to the new masterpiece.  You can also change the background color, but this is too difficult for them to do so they stay with the default black.  It would be nice for it to hold the background you choose after you shake the screen, so they don't have to go through the steps of choosing a new one, but then again, they don't care.  It's not for someone who is trying to make the next Picasso, but entertaining none the less.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Since I have bought this item I have dropped my phone 3 times. Once on hardwood floor, once on carpet, and once on tile. None of which were on purpose I promise you. But not a scratch or dent on my phone! Needless to say I am VERY happy I bought this product. It fits great, provides above average protection for the phone, and has a screen protector included for a very reasonable price!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|When I was young I would carry my Bible to church sometimes but I never had it anywhere else.  This app lets me carry my bible on my phone and my Xoom ALL the time.  It may seem wrong to some people, but now I take my Xoom to church and I can easily keep up with any Scripture reference lookups unlike when I use a traditional Bible. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying g to usher in an age of technology driving our church experience, but I do feel like this app lets a new generation experience God's Word where they may otherwise not take or have the opportunity.  It's an excellent app that offers the most amazing book to a world that needs it dearly, and in a very accessible medium.
0446573019|3.0|John Puller works for the Army's Criminal Investigation Unit. So whenever the Army is in need of the best to help solve a murder, they turn to John. This latest murder case is a gruesome one. A colonel and his family including two little children were slaughtered.<br /><br />John is joined by local authority Samantha \\"Sam\\" Cole. Together they head down a path of deceit, greed and murder.<br /><br />It has been several books since I have read one from Mr. Baldacci. I have to admit that this was not one of his strongest. Though, it still kept my interest and there was plenty of action. The adrenaline rush and the characters were what I found lackluster. John was not bad but the secondary characters did not pop off the pages at me. I wanted them to as this was the type of story that they needed to. I kind of went through the motions, reading this book but not really caring if the good guys came out on top. I did like Sam. She was tough and could hold her own with John. Don't be expecting much romance between John and Sam. They pretty much keep things on a professional level. There were not a lot of surprises in this book. Though, it is one that you can read and if you put it down for a few moments and still come back to and get right back into it. I hope that Mr. Baldacci's next book has lots more action.
B004SDEP38|1.0|I am really disenchanted with this app. It is touted as the standard for Android office apps , and, it has such minimal functionality that it seems to be little more than a glorified Notepad.  The Word Processor is the thing I use most and this one is sorely lacking.

B001HN6922|4.0|Critics were rough on the first Cars film and almost spiteful towards the second.<br /><br />Clearly they felt that it was time to bring down the mighty Pixar, and so they aimed their barbs at what they perceived as its weakest link.<br /><br />I personally loved the first Cars.  I thought it was sweet, funny, and inventive.  Whoever knew that inanimate objects could be so delightfully -- animated?<br /><br />And I appreciated the stories of the young racing car Lightning McQueen learning to slow down and smell the roses, as well as the old racing car Doc Hudson getting over his bitterness at being retired prematurely, to return to racing as a mentor for the young car.<br /><br />So I have deducted one star here, because the new film doesn't reach that level of emotion.  The moral of Cars 2, be true to yourself and appreciate your friends for who they are, feels a bit tacked on.<br /><br />But I must say, I found this a more enjoyable spy film than any of the recent James Bond efforts.<br /><br />The action zips along, the characters are as engaging as can be, and the locales around the world are breathtaking.  The story even has a clever resolution.<br /><br />The creative team does make one small misstep which I was hoping director John Lasseter would address in the commentary track.  Why would cars be eating canapes with wassabe mustard?  They wouldn't -- they drink fuel-and-additive cocktails.<br /><br />Unfortunately Lasseter doesn't acknowledge this dumb lapse in logic.<br /><br />But that's a small knock compared to the many pleasures this eye-popping CGI spectacle provides, even in 2D.<br /><br />If you have ever loved a car -- admit it, you probably have -- you can't help but enjoy this world of animated autos.

B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Excellent film. Beautifully done. Yes, there were several changes and cuts between the book and the movie - some of them major - but the end result was still a coherent film that captured the key elements of the story and the spirit of the book. The film picked up nicely after Part 1 and enthralled my teenage son, my husband, and myself for 130 minutes. This is certainly one of the best films in the series.   Best line: \\"I've always wanted to use that spell!\\" from Professor McGonagall  Please note that I am reviewing just the DVD disc. My friend picked up the Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital Copy version and gave me the DVD disc. I cannot comment on the quality of the Blu-ray or digital copy.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|New Xeon workstation build, LGA1155 socket. Stock cooler was fine for idle conditions (33C on core 1, 28 on the other 3 cores). Under stress (a pi calculator), temps ramped to 57C in 80 seconds, with no sign of slowing down. I stopped the test; too hot for my tastes.  Replace with this cooler, same test; temps stabilized at 45C at 120 seconds. A bit of fan noise, hardly noticeable.  You need space for this thing. It measures 6 1/4 inches tall off the CPU surface, and is a full three inches deep.   Under load, your CPU will be some 12C cooler with this, as compared to the stock cooler. For extended high-load operation, you can add a second fan; gives a bit of redundancy.

0618918248|3.0|but this was not an easy read for me.  I'm not sure if it's just his writing style or maybe his condescending tone.  I'm glad I pushed through this book because he does echo a lot of my own thoughts on religion.  His knowledge about the bible rivals any \\"true Christian\\" I've ever met.  His arguments against religion, especially the overbearing monotheistic ones, are backed up by this fact and that point... and so much more.  I found him quite prolix, but I guess he really wanted to make his arguments strong.  If you are agnostic, this will push you over the fence to atheism.  If you are religious, well, be ready for some logical scolding.
B005Q5OLC2|5.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal. It is a sweet, gentle narrative without high drama, but it does give us a look into a past that we must all remember: the lives of individuals who reach America, not as children, but as adults. My wife arrived her from overseas with much the same pressures on her as the main character here, Eilis. Until I read this book, I never realized the trials she endured, nor the perspective that she regarded her new home with. Eilis's experience is not a narrow Irish view of life in the US. It is a universal experience, which here just happens to be Irish.   For me, at least, Toibin accomplishes what all art seeks to accomplish: with this book, he changes the reader's view, even if a little bit, and readjusts that view with a more sympathetic and understanding sense about things that earlier the reader did not understand. Far from cold-hearted, Eilis is a sympathetic \\"everyman\\" we can all identify with.
0307388921|4.0|..and I really enjoyed it.  It was unexpected though.  The synopsis on the back cover really does not do the story justice.  This book was bizarre, unique, entertaining, and funny.  I really do like the main character despite all his flaws.  There are a couple twists at the end, although I figured one of them out relatively early on.  I'm probably one of the few people who have not read \\"Fight Club.\\"  After reading \\"Choke,\\" I am really looking forward to \\"Fight Club.\\"
B0067BEB10|5.0|UPDATE:  check the first comment to this review for a link to my review of the show itself!  Just saw it twice!<br /><br />When I first heard this Cirque soundtrack was going to remix, and in some cases, mash-up, some of the most iconic songs ever recorded, I was worried. But I listen to Michael's original tracks all the time, so I don't feel shortchanged by this reworking of his untouchable classics. If anything, I've really taken to this energized Cirque-ified remix. It's like a concentrated dose of Michael as interpreted through Soleil's prism. Somehow they've managed to retain Michael's essence, yet add their own flair to it, that somehow makes Michael stretch beyond his usual larger than life; which is interesting, considering he's no longer here. Although Michael's presence is clearly missing, his spirit is ever-present, via his own alternate vocal recordings of these impressive songs. It's almost as if he's graduated from Peter Pan to Wizard of Oz! Sizzling with omnipotence and infusing his rhythm and dance from the ethereal beyond.<br /><br />I downloaded my copy directly from Michael's website, because you get all the tracks from the Deluxe CD, including the 5 tracks that are missing from the download here at Amazon. I love this remix of Michael's classics. Think of this soundtrack as a re-imagined Best Of CD; if you want to stay true to the classics, maybe consider The Essential Michael Jackson CD. Personally, I enjoy having both. If you're open minded enough to embrace Michael continuing to push the envelope through those entrusted to carry forth his legacy, then this CD, and the Cirque show itself, is something you're sure to enjoy. It's all good to me, because I enjoy spending time with Michael.<br /><br />The Show<br /><br />Michael was in talks with Cirque while he was alive, and it's nice to see his dream has finally been realized; even if different from what he would have imagined were he here to add his Midas-touch from his sequined glove. My hubby and I will be seeing the show at the Staples Center, which should be special, given that's where MJ sang his last notes here on this Earth. I've been a Cirque fan for years and seen most all of their shows, and I've been a Michael fan my entire life, so I already know I'm going to love this show. And hearing this soundtrack only clinches the deal!<br /><br />Standout Tracks<br /><br />Michael's iconic hits need no introduction.

You can listen to short samples of each song here on Amazon, or check my first comment to this review for a link to where you can listen to 7 complete tracks for free before buying.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|I had to wait all week to get my Kindle Fire case as it was delivered to my job and I was not in the office the entire week.  After getting a $10 refund because of the price reduction and seeing all the bad reviews, I'd been searching all over to find a replacement case.  Well I just got the Marware case, put it on and am VERY pleased.  No, It doesn't feel cheap--it feels like it's made of the same materials as the back of the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />It doesn't add any appreciable weight to the Fire (thank goodness!) and it looks and feels great. The Fire is a hefty device and I really appreciate that the case is so lightweight.  For those that are looking for a stand made for your lap (cause I don't think this one is), you probably need to look at some of the pillow stands or the PadPivot lap stand.<br /><br />The Fire fits snugly into the case and it doesn't feel like it will fall out.  Another thing that I like about the case is that the skin I'm purchasing will be visible.  Many cases that I looked at either have a frame around the black part of the Fire's screen or cover it up in another way.  This case will let me add a little personalization to my device.<br /><br />I have had a Kindle since the 1st version and currently use an Android phone, Kindle Keyboard, Kindle 2, Kindle Touch and iPad.  All of them except the Kindle Touch have cases and this case stacks up to any of them.  Don't be afraid of the bad reviews--this case is fine! AND it looks great.<br /><br />I will update this review if wear and tear on the case changes my opinion.
B0043URV5U|5.0|For some odd reason, the catalog of Bob Seger (BS) was more or less limited to his greatest hits compilation from the early 90s, taking advantage of people buying anew music they had on record LPs in the more recent CD format.  Like other incomplete compilations from that period, e.g. Journey's Greatest Hits, it sold many million copies simply because those were the only sensible releases for people to buy (unlike Bob Seger, Journey's catalog was available but most people simply went for the Greatest Hits package).<br /><br />A few glaring omissions in the previous BS compilation included Fire Lake, Rock and Roll Never Forgets, Katmandu, Shame on the Moon and his biggest hit, Shakedown (he said he hated it at that time).  BS selected those tracks himself, not always the perfect judge on what the rest of the world considered his best moments.  These omitted tracks are all here.  Almost half, 12 tracks split evenly between his 3 biggest albums (Night Moves, Stanger in Town & Against the Wind), cover the 26 tracks in total.  The rest is mostly radio and fan favorites.  What you have here is thus a rather complete BS collection.<br /><br />There are still a few, albeit minor hits missing, such as Even Now, The Real Love and American Storm.  Also, his post 80s work is practically non-existent.  Since there is plenty of space left on each CD, one could ask for a little more.  I, however, don't mind that much (The Real Love the main exception, it is a great song), with the length of 2 sides of an LP just about the right length in one listening session of BS for me.<br /><br />I recommend paying a few extra $ (actually when this is written, maybe just a dollar or two) for this set as opposed to the single CD version since this one is way more complete track wise.  The old version also had terrible acoustics (maybe an indication of the sloppiness of that compilation)with a flat bright feel , something that has been smoothed on this version.  This is, finally, the decent Seger compilation.
0743298039|5.0|I love gothic novels and this one does not disappoint. Beautifully written with rich characters and a mesmerizing plot. I was pulled into the story and couldn't put it down. To me, the mark of a really great read is what I think of it long after I've finished the last page. And I think of this one often.
0553801473|2.0|At the end of this book, I just kind of powered through to get to the end.  This story is very boring and I just wish we could get the story through to the end.  So many sidesteps and too much thinking, should I go left or right, or stay here.  Come on GRRM, train the damn dragons, mount up and get it going.  Kill all the bad people and let good prevail.
1439152799|5.0|I actually ordered this through audible.com and listened to it on the drive to Jacksonville. What a great story! An old haunted house, spinster sisters, a young writer searching for truth and family secrets. The flashbacks are seamlessly mixed into the present day narrative and it has a wonderfully entertaining plot. But like so many of this genre, the ending was just a bit expected. That does not detract from the overall story. It is rich and absorbing. The characters are flawless, including the house which has a life of its own.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|this is a great app but if you want something that isn't an application unlock key and is more pretty to look at I would go for quick office. still lots of functionality added to app when upgraded from free and recommend snatching it up while it is free.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Just saw this for the first time tonight and I have to say the special effects and everything was perfect.  I think I said that about them all, but this time was different for several reasons.  Firstly, watching this on a 12 foot x 6 foot projector screen showing 720p via a Samsung Blu-Ray player on a Blu-Ray disc and a very nice 2.1 stereo speaker system is truely epic.  It's basically like watching it in the movie theatre at your home, but only much more comfortable.  Anyways, the storyline and sequences were pretty much the same as the other movies, but I really enjoyed this one.  It had awesome flashbacks of the moon landings, etc but I won't give any more spoiler alerts.  A very good movie indeed.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|On 'Talk That Talk\\", Rihanna definitely has sex on the brain, and she makes no apologies for it. This is without a doubt a CD dedicated to unabashed sexuality. Led by #1 single \\"We Found Love\\", 'Talk That Talk' has been highly anticipated, and once again, Rihanna delivers. The album is playable from beginning to end, but here are my favorites for now:<br /><br />\\"Do Ya Thang\\" (on Deluxe Edition) - The melody and mid-tempo rhythm are criminally catchy, and I love the way she sings the pre-chorus and chorus. She takes the taboo topic of Friends With Benefits head on. Sexual feelings or curiosity sometimes seep into close friendships between members of the opposite sex (and sometimes the same sex). The exploration is more common and riskier than you think. Easily my favorite song!<br /><br />\\"Where Have You Been\\" - One of two great dance/club tracks on the CD. I picked this one only because \\"We Found Love\\" has been played repeatedly for a while now. Rihanna does dance cuts so well!<br /><br />\\"Drunk On Love\\" - While \\"Rehab\\" (from Good Girl Gone Bad) was about a bad addiction to a toxic lover, \\"Drunk On Love\\" celebrates the brighter aspects of getting caught up. She expresses her philosophy of love throughout the song that has the mid-tempo sway of \\"What's My Name?\\", only grander.<br /><br />\\"Cockiness\\" - Nasty, hilarious lyrics bounced by heavy bass and an arrangement that would make Timbaland and Missy Elliot proud. This one is fun!<br /><br />\\"Roc Me Out\\" - It's got a \\"Rude Boy\\" vibe with a rock edge that makes it just different enough to still feel fresh.<br /><br />Frankly, the puritanical view of sex in the United States still catches me off-guard.  (I don't think one person was traumatized by Janet Jackson's nipple shot during her Super Bowl performance). Rihanna gets a lot of flack from people who are uncomfortable with the blatant sexuality in her music. I, on the other hand, salute her. She doesn't address it academically; she talks about it instinctively which is most natural when it comes to the topic at hand. Sexuality is nothing to be ashamed of. Do ya thang, Rih-Rih! Do ya thang!lity is nothing to be ashamed of. Do ya thang, Rih-Rih! Do ya thang!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|this is THE greatest PDF viewer available on the market. I use this app daily. for school textbooks in my Toshiba thrive tablet (honeycomb not rooted), also nit taking in my digital textbooks or manuals for Adobe software.   the amount of features within this app is amazing. well worth the misery. I was so impressed with this app I even paid for it from the android market.   their is a feature that is included in tjeis pro version that allows usage on a pc. I have mot set it up het but I've seen people use it at my college as I them.   the speed of the is phenomenal. also an extremely clean,user friendly, easy to use interface.  I highly recommend this to everyone. no.matter the amount of use of PDFs.   I highly recommend this above anything else for college student. mainly forthe features of highlighting content and adding notes to digital books.
0763644765|5.0|I checked this book out from the library last week and am thinking I may have to purchase it!  It's a wonderful choice for a child who is capable of learning to use the potty but is somewhat reluctant to make the switch.  Our girls both (2 and 4 years old) love the book!  Our 4 year old has largely taken over the potty training of her sister simply for the opportunity to read the book while her sis is doing her business.  They have both been running around quoting the book for days now.  I like that!  Keep her thinking of using the potty and we're halfway there!  This book encourages the trainee to make the choice of using the potty rather than the diaper.  \\"I COULD pee in my diaper, but should I?\\" is the basic theme.  It probably won't help the child who is just learning what a potty IS and how to use it, but it's great for that stage where consistency and reluctance are issues.
1439102813|5.0|This was simply one of the best books I've ever read;<br />Lisa has an amazing talent.  I'd like some of that talent... oh well, I'll have to<br />settle for enjoying books like this.  By the time I finished this book<br />I felt intimately connected to all of the main characters and had<br />more compassion for a fictional character than I thought possible.<br />A very emotional and moving story, without being too dramatic or sappy.<br />It was also pretty informative, which I do appreciate in my novels.
B004LWZW8I|2.0|The Immortals is a lousy movie geared for children and teens.  The 3D is not in your face.  Spent the entire film trying to figure out who so and so was. This kept my mind grinding far more than the drab, dullard film.  Hyperion! Of course, Mickey Rourke, still handsome after botched plastic surgery. Theseus was the mystery man. I know this guy. Have seen him before. This is going to drive me nuts I thought as the filmed rolled by on the screen. At least trying to find out who Theseus was was interesting.  Ms. Pinto's face could have launched a thousand ships. That would have been better than just about any flick. She is so hot and so sweet. Made her in a heartbeat. The same for the human appearing robot/transformer siren in Transformers, Isabel Lucas.  Soon as I got home I looked into the character Theseus. It was Henry V111's sidekick in the Tudors,Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, Henry Cavell. Should have known. Have seen every episode of the Tudors.  Never look at the credits. Who cares.Forgot anyway.  Summing up: The WWE meets mythology in 3D. And I have 3D TVs.
1451648537|5.0|Mr. Isaacson's clean and elegant writing is perfect for this objective review of the incredible life of Steve Jobs. The book portrays every phase of his meteoric life and every complex facet of his personality. It is a moving, compelling, and truthful portrait of a man, with flaws like all of us, who both despite and because of those flaws, became an icon-by providing us with wonderful things we didn't even know we longed for. Thank you for this Mr. Isaacson. You have created an \\"insanely great\\" book that teaches and inspires. I hope everyone reads it.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|It is very good for children and adults. It is very easy for us and it is very good for a gift.

B000003TAB|5.0|This album was excellent; even though it was a compilation of unpublished tracks, the songs flowed into one another superbly. If you like Grunge and Nirvana's sound, this is an excellent collection of their lesser-known tracks in one convenient bundle.   If you purchase this, buy the original CD. Much higher quality, and it's cheaper.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|The app dont work for my phone and should work on them all or not even show on the market its nothing but a wast of time
B0062LU85S|4.0|Unlike the first three soundtracks, there are only a few songs I absolutely adore on this soundtrack (I love every single one on the others). It isn't awful, but it just wasn't as impressive as the others. I have yet to see the movie, so hopefully the songs fit with it.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie more, but the never ending scenes of her having hallucinations every minute and then coming back to reality, I felt it underscored the harsh realities of becoming a ballet superstar.  When I was young I was surrounded by those who performed in ballet and it is truly an unforgiving profession to be in, but it has some amazing benefits too. This movie should have done more to show why someone would push themselves to such extremes, instead of an oversimplified competitive reason alone (how Hollywood).  As much as there are those who wrote on how true this is to life as a ballerina, I disagree on the need for constant hallucinations to drive this point. The realities of what a person reaching the top of ballet world would outperform this movie any day and undress it as typical Hollywood theatrics.  But our society has increasingly become addicted to over-dramatization, slick CGI over well written scripts, and over fantasizing true life stories.  As much as the 5 star reviewers may dismiss this, I will not be amazed if ten years from now (or less), this movie will be selling at bargain basement prices and all but forgotten due to new movies even more outlandish in interpreting the realities of striving to become a superstar.
B006B31B80|2.0|This show has become a slow & uninteresting soap opera. In a post apocalyptic world we're still supposed to care about stupid relationship issues in episode 5?  Not only this, but zombies are attracted to noise, the characters are aware of this, yet they drive around with a Harley, waste bullets shooting at can targets, and I just can't stand the level of stupidity put forth by the writers.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|classic album. I never was a really big Drake fan. This album definately made me respect him more as a r & b singer as well as a rapper. U u can hear and see the growth in his music. Its one of those cd's that you can listen to from start to finish. its been playing all week in my car and I have no plans on taking it out anytime soon!  Favorite tracks:  runner ups:  over my dead body  shot for me    crew Love  lord knows   marvins room/buried alive  Under Ground kings  Make me proud  hyfr  cameras/good ones  headlines  doing it wrong  the real her  look what u done  practice  ride
B006B31B80|5.0|So I was about to agree with other reviewers that this season has gotten more soap opera than zombie survival. However the life and death tension and moral dilemmas created by a \\"zombie land\\" are excellently woven into this episode that the dramatic tension jacks up even another notch. ATTENTION: POTENTIAL SPOILER!!  with a couple of close calls with walkers to get the heart going and the dread living in the barn on the undead side coupled with the some of the groups emotional baggage sets up an explosive next few episodes ready to blow with this building heat.  Its not Soap its Simmer and I am going to keep watching until it BLOWS!
B004SDSSFY|3.0|officesuite pro which was the free app of the day a few days ago on amazon is a bit better than this. they do the same thing, its just officesuite pro is a bit more graceful and the gui is better. still a good altenative. works well on samsung galaxy tab 10.1 just fine. sucks it needs 2 icons on your app list. the unlock key and the main app. officesuite is only one
0007119267|5.0|The classic British mystery tradition's doyen of death is Dame Agatha Christie. Evil Under the Sun is a Poirot novel written in 1941. The book is able to hold its own and is a fine representative of Christie's brilliant work.<br />  The Plot: the loci of the action is the Jolly Roger Hotel a resort area on the Devon coast. Hercule Poirot, the retired little Belgian detective, is taking a much needed holiday. However, in Christie's universe there is no escape from murder! The murder victim is the lovely \\"man-killer\\" Arlena Marshall. Her husband is Captain Kenneth Marshall. He had earlier been married to a deceased woman who was acquitted of a heinous murder. Living with the Marshalls is Linda the daughter Captain Marshall had with his first wife. Stepdaughter and stepmother do not like one another! Christine Redfern is also believed to be angry at Arlena for seducing her husband Patrick Redfern. Rosamund Darley is a former flame of Captain Marshall. When Arlena is found strangled and found dead on a secluded beach there is no shortage of suspects. Several of the guests at the Jolly Roger Hotel had reason to wish the beautiful woman out of the picture. Whodunit?<br />  As in so many Christie novels,the key to solving who murdered the victim is to examine the past lives of the chief suspects. The book is a fine way to spend a few hours with Hercule Poirot as the reader seeks to match wits with the crime detecting whiz! Enjoy!
B00000DGUY|2.0|Many of the songs are mediocre and lyrical deficient.  They lack insight and are one-side.  Sonically, above normal. About two songs that are good.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|Rihanna keeps with her consistent, yearly release schedule with her sixth solo album since her debut in 2005. I think my favorite thing about this album is that it is so easy to just put on and listen to. The main topic of the album is sex, as you can clearly tell when you listen to \\"Roc Me Out\\" or \\"Cockiness (Love It)\\". I find the ballads mediocre, but that's probably because I'm not a big fan of slow music. My favorite track on this album is the title track, \\"Talk That Talk\\". I could live without Jay Z's opening rap, but they have recreated their \\"Umbrella\\" success with this song. The chorus is one of the most infectious things I've heard all year. The album isn't generic, which I think sets it apart from other pop releases this year. All in all, Rihanna has released what I find to be her most solid record yet. Y'all have to pick up the deluxe edition too, because \\"Red Lipstick\\" and \\"Do Ya Thang\\" are great additions to the album.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love this movie soo much. Every thought involved into making this movie can be clearly see to try and compliment the magnificence of the book and also reflects more on what is correct for the Regent time period. They very well kept out any urge to add modern day nonsense's of stupidity or force for a sexual tension that have no sense to be there.<br />  Also with this new version, it adds a new beauty to the movie that was never seen in the previous version. In my opinion, it is completely worth one's money!
B005HSG3TC|2.0|Opinions may vary, but I think, for the money, it is cheaply made.  I'm sure it would do the job in protecting the device but for $29 (actually $39 before the price reduction), I expected more.
0446573019|1.0|Very disappointing to say the least. Most PC thriller I have read: either environemental issues, rural jobs focused, dumb rednecks who smoke, dumb rednecks who are to fat. Baldacci, the multi-millionaire author who is trying to suck up to the 99%. I doubt this book was written by David Baldacci, I could believe this book was written by a clueless, progressive New York book editor educated at Brown. Forget Child, Baldacci is trying to compete with Grisham for the PC wacko award. Regarding future books, Baldacci is in my penalty box.
B004GYY714|4.0|I listen to a lot of radio.  I particularly enjoy listening to radio stations elsewhere in the U.S. and also in the U.K.  I found this app great for finding stations by location and genre.  You can select presets for your favorite stations.  Right now I'm listening to BBC Radio 1 in England.  I'll try Australia in a bit.<br /><br />I am new to apps on  mobile devices and the Fire can sometimes be a bit slow to respond when you tap on an option, but that's the only issue I had.  Also, the first time after I stopped playing within the app and then when back to it from the Fire's home page, I got a screen that tried to push me to get the Pro version.  It took me a bit to figure out how to move on from that page.  I was thinking I was going to have to delete the app when I tapped on the logo at the top and it took me to the radio menu.<br /><br />I liked the app so well I added a link to it on my PC.  But I'm really thrilled to have found it for Fire.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book was a GREAT sequel to The Lost Hero and i cant wait for the next one to come out.
B004XZ99LO|5.0|First let me say that there is 3D and then there is 3D.  I have purchased and enjoyed this disk using a Samsung 61 inch \\"3D Ready\\" DLP TV.  This is an important distinction.  My TV uses the \\"checkerboard\\" format rather than the 3D Blu-Ray standard.  This checkerboard format is, in most respects, superior to that which you get on the new 3D TV's.  This may account for the negative reviews from owners of the newer sets.  The 3D is also superior to that which you saw in the original IMAX 3D theatre release.  That is because theatres use passive 3D glasses rather than active. The difference in depth is substantial.  The 3D, for example, in \\"Polar Express\\" is disappointing even in IMAX, but, placed on the home screen, is dramatic.  Having said this, I can report that the friends with whom I have watched this on our system are simply amazed.  This is Cirque as it should be.  I have some quibbles with the way they have depicted the \\"Journey of Man\\", but these can be reduced to artistic differences and the film should be enjoyed on its own merit.  I would also say that I have lent the film to friends with the official Blu-Ray format and the results are no where near as good.  We are at the mercy of decisions made by big corporations.  From what I have been able to read, the checkerboard format was too expensive to incorporate in plasma TV's, so it was abandoned. Plasma was not as good as DLP, but corporations had huge investments to recoup.  So, they sold it to the public.  We are all the poorer for this. (Please note: Mitsubishi still offers checkerboard and all new Panasonic Blu-Ray 3D players now incorporate this technology.  I believe that this is a bow to its superiority for the home viewer.  You will find both on Amazon.)  In any event, this is good news for \\"3D Ready\\" set owners and lovers of Cirque. For folks who own other technology, try it.  If it works, you are in for a great viewing experience.
1594744769|3.0|So glad someone posted about the one sentence. It is too bad that one thing can not be left out of an otherwise fascinating book. Oh well, it was for a book club of 4 10-14 yr old boys and I would be \\"the mom who let her son bring that book\\". Why oh why can we not just leave a great book alone. These editors:)<br />Thank you again.
B005WZZRD8|5.0|When I first got to listen to all those remix songs, I was amazingly surprised that a pop dancing song can be remixed to something so epic. Every single song in the album is able to let you feel a totally different gaga. And it comes with the HBO speical which is a must collection for little monsters!!!
B004TI5N38|2.0|At times I thought that Lee Child had ghost written this book for Baldacci, but it was nowhere near up to his standards. The character in this novel was a poor excuse for Jack Reacher. Maybe he was supposed to be his ugly step-brother. Whatever, it was a far cry from reading another Reacher book. If you are a big fan of Lee Child as I am, forget this one. It will be a big disappointment. I have liked most of Baldacci's earlier work, but he needs to get back to his own work instead of trying to copy someone else.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|There's no need to say anymore about this album than anyone else has. Drake has a more mature sound in this album and you can tell that he's growing as an artist. The production is great and the lyrical content is great. Not all 17 tracks are on point, but Lord Knows, Underground kings, Make Me Proud, The Real Her, Take Care, Over My Dead Body, and Look What you've Done more than make up for the mediocre (not bad at all) songs on the album. This is a must have album for 2011. Caution, though, if you don't like Drake singing, then you may want to preview the album first. He has a couple of R&Besque songs. Overall, I stand by my opinion of a must have album of 2011.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This movie absolutely isn't for everyone. I tried to share it with other people and they hated it. It is not really a movie in the traditional sense, or a pretentious attempt at trying to infuse big name actors with an art-house drama, it's something new, something different. I can't explain this movie in words because a simplistic description would not do it justice. This isn't a film for the monkey brain, it's a film for the soul. I was emotionally stirred by this movie because it is a visualization of what I have only known as thoughts and contemplation.<br /><br />This movie came to me at a time in my life when I have begun a phase of embracing close personal introspection and I really want to get beyond the materialism that I've been enculturated to believe is so important. I want simplicity and happiness, I don't want the big house and the credit cards, I want a simple life in a simple place where I can focus on living my life. This movie is a statement that even though we as individuals feel so important in our self-centered lives and feel worthy of the attention of the universe, there are processes that are far greater than us in the expanse of the universe. The film doesn't superimpose any kind of belief about religion unto the viewer, it remains respectful and open for individual interpretation. This movie doesn't hijack your thoughts and tell you what the story is, in fact, this movie is more synchronous with imagination than any other I have seen. The crescendo of this movie is the God/universe scene which is one of the most spectacular cinematic sequences I have ever witnessed, I wept while watching it.<br /><br />I don't recommend this movie as a casual rental or something the family will enjoy. It's one of those movies that requires attention and a time when your mind and your life can be quiet for a couple of hours and you want to have an emotional experience rather than be superficially entertained.<br /><br />My favorite line from the film that resonated the most and seems to underscore the intention of the film was \\"there are two ways through life, the way of nature and the way of grace. You have to choose which one to follow.\\", I choose grace and believe that those who enjoyed this film and will enjoy it are of the same belief.to underscore the intention of the film was \\"there are two ways through life, the way of nature and the way of grace.

B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Not going to review the movie, we all saw it and w/ the kids we will see it 100's of times...  I wanted to point out the menue that you have to navigate through is finaly easy & enjoyable.  Instead of the endless previews that you have to push chapter buttons to get past before the disk software will let you pull up the main menue.  Cars 2 starts w/ the typical Disney ads but the pop-up menue is right on the bottom of the screen, \\"Play Movie\\" looking you in the face & no hassles.  Thanks Disney/Pixar.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Best keyboard I've used with the best prediction.  Thought I'd quit using it when I purchased the Galaxy S4 that already uses SwiftKey, but Samsung's version of SwiftKey isn't as good as the original: go figure. ;^)  I'd give it the 5th star if they'd let me pick the color schemes or provided more themselves.
B004EPZ09S|3.0|Steven Soderbergh's \\"Contagion\\" is a dark and depressing film, with a stellar cast that includes Matt Damon as Mitch, whose wife, Beth, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, becomes infected with a deadly and highly contagious virus.  In short order, men, women, and children become ill in various places all over the world; they cannot swallow, have a hacking cough, sweat profusely, convulse, foam at the mouth, and subsequently die.  Laurence Fishburne is solemn as Doctor Ellis Cheever of the Centers for Disease Control.  Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard) of the World Health Organization, Dr. Erin Mears (an excellent performance by Kate Winslet), and Dr. Ally Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) all work tirelessly to contain what could potentially turn into a pandemic. Elliot Gould nicely underplays his role as a brilliant scientist named Dr. Sussman.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Soderbergh's directorial style is somewhat remote and unfeeling, distancing the audience from the proceedings.  The editing is disjointed and choppy, making the plot difficult to follow at times.  There is plenty of gore and horror, but it does not seem quite real.  Although Mitch and his daughter, Jory, share some touching scenes, most of the characters rush around madly against the pulsating backdrop of a loud and menacing musical soundtrack. Also on hand is the slimy Alan (Jude Law), a snide blogger who claims that the pharmaceutical companies are greedy villains who profit from the public's misery. With the virus spreading so quickly, people start to panic.  The director inserts scenes of chaos, looting, and violence to reveal the bestiality that lies beneath our thin veneer of civilization.<br /><br />Screenwriter Scott Z. Burns seems to be warning us that with people traveling all over the globe every day, an outbreak similar to the one described in this movie could occur at any time. Still, \\"Contagion\\" is more of a CliffsNotes version of an epidemic and its aftermath than a meaningful treatment of what such a catastrophe would entail.would entail.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The game is very strategical. It runs very smoothly as well. Idk why anyone will rate it below a five.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|one of my favorite apps because I can share just about anything across all the platforms I use including a Pc, Mac, ipad, blackberry and now kindle fire. its easy, effortless and intuitive. somehow they are constantly making it even better. what more could you ask for?
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|probably the most overrated game of all time. if you like mindless repetitive games this is for you! its sad because there are so many great games that get little to no attention.
B005ER6STG|2.0|Another movie that I purchased based on the hype, never again.   While the movie is very graphic and deals with the very dark side of humanity, it's nothing original or really that shocking. Headlines on the 6 O'Clock News are more shocking.  This movie takes taboos and basically exploits them for the sake of making a movie about the horrors people are capable of.  If you like torture, forced drug addiction, rape, pedophilia, gore, necrophilia, porn and alcoholism, then this movie is for you to watch over and over.
1451627289|5.0|I've been a Stephen King fan since Carrie came out. I've enjoyed all but a few of his books...what I enjoy about Stephen King is his willingness to try different genres.<br /><br />This book, to me, seemed to capture the best of his talents. Some of the negative reviews focus on how long the book is, how detailed his description of things like proms and apartment layouts and everyday life are. But that is one of the joys of a good Stephen King novel, the minute details that bring his characters and his places to life. If I want spare, sharp prose, I won't be reading King; that's not what he does.<br /><br />But if I want a novel with a supernatural edge, a love story, some weird twists and sharp turns, King delivers. If you're a fan, you even get to revisit Derry, where the story \\"It\\" took place. There are echoes from past novels, but they don't detract from the story if you haven't read them.<br /><br />And his time travel concept is interesting. Each visit is the first time. The past is obdurate (and we even find out why). Jake Epping is not a typical hero, but he is a hero.<br /><br />And the story about the Kennedy assisnation was very interesting to me. I was only 4 years old when it happened, so I don't really have any memories of that day. And by the time I was old enough to care about politics, it seemed like ancient history to me. So I learned a lot about the circumstances leading up to the assisnation, and the aftermath. It's one of the few history lessons I've ever enjoyed. The story also brought back childhood memories of a time gone by; that was bittersweet.<br /><br />I actually listened to the book on my MP3 player; I will buy the print version at a later date, and enjoy the story again.
0060825456|4.0|What a great kids' story. I would have liked parts of it to be expanded and for the end not to feel as rushed, but that's a combination of always enjoying Gaiman's worlds and not being the right age group for the story.
1451627289|5.0|I absolutely love the new book.  Ordered it before it came out.  Can't lay it down.  So good.  BUT AMAZON I AM MAD.  YOU NOW HAVE LOWERED THE PRICE BY SEVERAL DOLLARS.    I will think twice before I pre order another book from Amazon.
0790729628|5.0|I initially saw this movie when it came out. I was transfixed. Visually LA had been transformed into a scifi  future of new gas filled streets, flying cars, and the disturbing unknown. The future was here and I had been lucky, well sort of, to be immersed into the future. The movie had me almost hyperventilating. Over the years I have watched Blade Runner numerous times. Though all acted superbly, and the visuals and the special affects were superb it was Rutger Hauer's role as Roy Batty that made the film catch fire. There is plenty of symbolic characters to go around but it is clear that Hauer's character is the new Christ figure. Besides putting the nail in his hand and being called savior, he saves Deckart, (Harrison Fords) Judas character. The importance of the new philosophy is in Hauer's killing the creator.

B00466HN86|5.0|The end of the movie summarizes it best:  some men will heed the call; some will not.  Nevertheless, the eternal consequences of failing to acknowledge our duties as men are too awesome to miss watching this movie.  I suppose women will watch it; but, they must bring their husband or fiance to watch it, because it is for and about men.  Any woman who brings her special man to watch this movie shows her love for him.  I saw teenage girls in the audience with teenage boys; I believe any girl or woman who wants to see if she is dating a real man should watch it!

Arctic Silver 5 always works and is always in the top 5% of the heatsink greases as far as cooling is concerned.  I'm not really looking for any replacements for this stuff, it works great.
B002ECEJ3G|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo30VDT3HUIFE26]]This is my analysis of Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse
0307593312|1.0|It has become apparent Murakami has lost steam.  His stories and style of writing are forced and repetitive, almost to the point of being a symptom of dementia.  As with [[ASIN:0307278735 After Dark]], 1Q84 has been lackluster and surmounted to nothing more than a waste of time.  I do not recommend 1Q84.  Save your money and time (this book is about a thousand pages on poor quality paper and binding... all which way about 30 pounds).  The only reason I didn't sell the book to a used book store halfway through was my respect for Murakami...  Sadly, the book only worsened to a point of being a vile droll non-story, degrading my almost idolistic worship for the author.  Having finished the book, I have nothing but sympathy for the Japanese readers who read the first release that ended with the 2nd book.  Murakami probably felt \\"compelled\\" to write more and produce the 3rd book because of the resulting backlash from the critics and readers.  Knowing this, the 3rd book is an even more trite supplication that reads like hydrochoric acid sprayed as a fine mist onto your corneas.  In all, 1Q84 appears to be a social experiment in testing the will of his readers.  In this work, Murakami has played the role of a literary torturer imposing benevolence on his fanbase.  If Murakami doesn't have the desire to write, he should hang up his hat and gracefully bow out instead of creating constipated byproducts like 1Q84.  Still, Murakami has produced some amazing works and I apologize for my overly critical review of 1Q84.  His short stories are spectacular and [[ASIN:037571894X A Wild Sheep Chase]] is unmatched.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|Awakenings the dvd is one I wouldn't part with in a hurry.  I watched the video probably a couple of decades ago and  one movie which has stuck in my mind.  I find the story line touching and the characters witty  and adorable.  My dad thought it was a bit heavy but my 70 year old partner  ended up watching it through even though he thought it may   not be his type of movie.  Something to think and be surprised about.
0143039431|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath was a truly amazing novel. John Steinbeck expertly tells the story of the Joad Family. The way Steinbeck wrote of the Joads' struggles was entertaining and informative. This novel was somewhat depressing, however, because of how real it was. Families moved to find work during the Great Depression and found themselves struggling to find work, just like the Joad family. A quote I found very interesting, \\"For man, unlike any other thing organic or inorganic in the universe, grows beyond his work, walks up the stairs of his concepts, emerges ahead of his accomplishments,\\" shows the significance of growing from experiences. The Joad family grew from everything they went through. This was one of the best books I've read, and I will definitely be revisiting it!
B001EN71CW|3.0|I adore this series... So much so, that even though I own it on DVD, I now have the blu-ray version.  I hate to say it, but on blu-ray, it isn't that great. I've now watched 1/3 of the series on blu-ray, and it's grainy. Very grainy...  It actually looks better on DVD.  Content wise, however, I say that everyone in the world should watch this series. It's that awesome.
B005FITIGO|3.0|I am a fan of the mostly dialogue and little action type movies. Not many get made these days so when one comes along I salivate like Pavlov's dog. Margin Call is a fictional drama based on some of the real life events we saw mature in the 2008 economic meltdown. We are still reeling from this mess in 2011 and we will all be paying for the incomprehensible foolishness and cronyism for many, many, many years to come. This movie makes characters like Wall Street's Gordon Gecko look like a street beggar by comparison. Building houses of cards is nothing to be proud of and while the characters all feign humility and acknowledgment of that fact, none of them do anything to change it. Why? Because none of them actually believes it. Wealth and power have total control of their every waking (and even sleeping) moment.  In the end, all characters must admit to their failure as self-righteous twits because all involved were so personally leveraged they had to make a deal with the Devil.  Watching them all squirm offers a touch of fun for the viewer.<br /><br />This is a decent film, though far from perfect. I can understand why some people will say it is just too boring. Yes there were times that I found myself a bit bored by the relentless diatribes full of justification through Darwinian zero sum game philosophy and the bang-you-over-the-head post modernist human condition, detestation for their fellow man (suckers deserve to lose) stuff. There is little subtly and nuance to this film; no lines of gray, no ambiguities. The characters are all despicable scoundrels and thieves who become a bit cartoonish at some point. More editing would have been appropriate as the movie is clearly half an hour too long.<br /><br />All that said, I did enjoy it. Some of the writing is sharp, well researched, and it wasn't dumbed down for the masses like one might expect. Most people will not really understand what is going on.  What created such fear in these desk jockeys working to solve their problem over a 24 hour period becomes obvious as it is revealed to the movie goer that NO ONE really knows what's going on. Part of the point of the film is that no person or no group actually understood what was going on or how these ridiculous financial models were developed -let alone capitalized. In the end we are left wondering why so many \\"smart\\" people can leave values, sense, and sensibilities behind and do such stupid things...oh ya that's right, it's that whole greed thing. Not so fast. There has to be more to it than just greed right? The acting is sharp and well done by all. As expected Irons, Tucci, and Spacey are standouts -more Tucci would have been great.<br /><br />This movie is an attempt to shed some light on the absurdity that has become Wall Street --where unbridled greed has become so ubiquitous that Wall Street firms and banks are now nothing short of crime syndicates staffed by well dressed con men.  This ain't your daddy's Wall Street anymore.  Gone are the antiquated Graham and Dodd days of fair valuation analysis and steady dividend yield investments.  What we have now are supercomputers processing probability algorithms designed by rocket scientists processing at millions of iterations per second.  What they are doing isn't illegal (yet?), but it is wrong and they all know it. When heavy-handed government regulation comes crashing down on the financial industry they all cry foul but they have no one to blame but themselves.<br /><br />BTW, how's your 401K doing these days???  Recommended.24 hour period becomes obvious as it is revealed to the movie goer that NO ONE really knows what's going on.

B005HSG3VK|2.0|I received my Marware Microshell Cover today and really took the time to decide if I liked it or not.  The mixed reviews left me wondering what I would receive and, upon arrival, I did think I would keep the case since it is very light and the MicroShell is quite durable.  However, my criticism is with the flip side of the cover and for this I am not keeping it.  It's not impressive at all - it is merely a sueded material, flimsy and of a low quality when compared to the MicroShell side.  To adequately protect my Kindle Fire I would need to remove it from the case, turn it around and snap it back into place so the screen is protected against a drop or impact when not in use.  Excessive handling of the device outside of any case is just increasing the chances of being \\"butter fingers\\" and dropping my Kindle Fire.  I want a durable case to protect my Kindle Fire at all times and the design of this is questionable in being able to do that without making a switcharoo every time I want to use it.

B0010HA68I|5.0|What a genius idea!  I spent 5 days backpacking with my Nikon D90 and 18-200 VR zoom hanging from ny neck on the Nikon strap, and I do not recommend that!  Upon returning I set out to find a better way to carry a heavy SLR.  The Op/Tech strap system is the best I've found, AND it's by far the most cost effective.  These in particular, if you're a hiker or wear a backpack while traveling, are awesome.  They clip right onto your backpack straps and transfer the weight of the camera to your pack instead of your neck.  They also stabilize the camera pretty well from swinging, etc.  And don't worry about what to do when you take the backpack off- just unclip the quick release fittings and the camera goes in your hand while the straps stay on the pack!  Dump the pack, connect the quick release fittings to your regular Op/Tech strap and you're back in business with a normal camera strap inside of 10 seconds.  I also have the sling strap (compare to the name brands that are $80!!!) and I love that as well, all again configurable in seconds since they share the quick release fittings.  Great product!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I must say that I've been holding off to make my choice of office apps for my use. I've been using Google Docs and Evernote, both amazing apps, but they're really not office apps. Out of the top three office apps, I have to say this one has won my heart. First of all this app installs on both my phone and my tablet (Android 2.3.7 and Android 3.1.) In addition to just installing on Honeycomb the app uses the new frame layouts and over all doesn't look like an old Gingerbread app running on a larger screen. The next immediate feature I noticed was it has a format bar. You don't have to navigate the menu and then navigate to the desired effect, for example bold. Like all the other office apps it has the ability to connect to my Google Documents. In general, my decision comes down to portability (phone and tablet), ease of use, and aesthetics.
B002BWP49M|5.0|Being a huge fan of the books and a pretty big fan of the movies, I was blown away at what a great job they did with this movie installment. I loved the visual and audio parallels they drew between the original movie, Twilight, and this movie. For instance (Spoiler Alerts throughout): I loved how they played Flightless Bird during the wedding ceremony and the way the camera circled them kissing in the same manner the camera circled E & B kissing at Prom at the very end of Twilight. It was a subtle, yet stunning way to visually tie the two movies together and really made more of an emotional impact than if they had just shot them straight on and plugged in a different song. That was genius. And that dress...gorgeous. Just as it was described in the book.   I also loved that rather than having one continuous honeymoon \\"consummation\\" scene, they broke it up with Bella thinking about certain moments the next morning after looking in the mirror for the first time, where she's no longer a virgin. It was all done so tastefully. The way one's first time should be at that age. Not at some house party or in the back of some guy's car. For those who read the books and knew how Edward did everything he could to exhaust Bella with activities on their honeymoon so she'd be too tired to \\"try again\\", you have to admit that Bill Condon did such a great job showing you visually all the things they were doing without either character having to come out and say, I'm/you're trying to exhaust you/me. And it was adorable with KS put on her little nightgown and leaned against the wall...I got married when I was 19 and I felt the exact same way when I put on lingerie for the first time and dreaded walking into the bedroom with my little gown on. I felt like a child playing dress-up, much like it came off Bella felt.   I was also very impressed by the manner with which Bill Condon allowed us to see through the eyes of Jacob for the first time and hear what he hears with regard to the internal dialog between him and the pack. That scene where the wolves were running to the lumber yard and their voices echoed in Jacob's mind...that was so perfectly done. AND, I loved loved loved the way the Sam and Jacob had their battle for alpha. It was as if you, the person watching the movie, was in the mind of a wolf who is being forced into submission by it's Alpha. The CGI team did a great job because I forgot I was watching computer generated wolves and the intensity of the scene felt like I was there witnessing the true dynamic of a wolf pack.   I thought the birth scene was beyond intense. The scene almost mirroring that as it's written in the book. I think they showed just the right amount of Bella's internal agony during her transformation. For those of us who read the books, to say she had a prolonged bout of suffering during her transformation would be an understatement. However, if they had shown more of that in the movie, it would have taken from the torture that Edward was going through thinking he had lost Bella, and Jacob's malevolence towards Renesmee prior to imprinting on her. That whole scene allowed for each character's state of mind to be both seen, visually, and felt, emotionally. Powerfully shot and brilliantly executed.   I imagine the imprinting scene was a difficult one to translate from paper to screen. They did a great job in this as well. Not in any way cheesy, but sweet and breathless...if that makes any sense. The only thing I did not love about it was that the girl/teenager Jacob sees as an older Renesmee appeared to be CGI. They used an actual young girl to play the younger Renesmee, why not use a real person for the older Renesmee too? I'm sure Hollywood has a few young actresses that would have auditioned for the part???  I loved the fight between the wolves and the Cullens at the very end of the movie. In the books, you go from Jacob's perspective where he witnesses Bella's death and then walks into the living room to kill Renesmee, only to imprint on her. And then you go immediately back to Bella's perspective where she's riving in pain while she's transforming into a vampire. I feel Melissa Rosenburg had a stroke of brilliance when she decided to add this scene so that the audience could see what could have happened in the books, but did happen in the movie, during the time period between Jacob imprinting on Renesmee and Bella awakening for the first time as a vampire. Another unexpected and totally welcomed brilliant surprise of this movie.   Another welcome surprise for me was while Bella was at the very end of her transformation. I thought it was a touching visual moment that just before her heart beat for the very last time, we witnessed Bella's memories in a somewhat reverse chronological order, ending with her very first human memory as a baby in the arms of her parents bouncing her in front of a mirror.   But what was not a surprise and what I've been telling my fellow twi-hards the past couple years is the very last scene of the movie. Once I heard they were splitting BD into two parts, I've always maintained there's only one way to end part 1 with truly visual impact...and that is to witness Bella's subtle transformation from a broken human to a perfect vampire, surrounded by the Cullens, with the scene closing in on Bella's perfect facial features, zooming into her perfectly shut eyes...that suddenly open the most gorgeous crimson red....and straight to credits. I actually gave myself a little pat on the back for that one because so much of the movie exceeded my expectations of visual and audio creativity, and yet the last scene ending a certain way was something I was very adamant with my friends about, and sure enough that's how it ends. So maybe now I can revel in having an ounce of the vision that Bill Condon and Melissa Rosenburg possess...hey I'll take that ounce.    Aside from the standout scenes I've mentioned herein, I thought Kristen Stewart did her best portrayal of Bella yet. Her facial expressions alone are so real to each moment they're almost tangible. I've enjoyed the work KS has done prior to the Twilight Saga, and I am so glad these movies have launched her career because I am certain she will be one of the great leading ladies of acting for many decades to come. So to all Twi-hards out there. This movie was amazing. A must see for those who loved the books and fans of the previous movies. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so that I can add it to my Twilight Saga collection.
B005POK858|5.0|This is a stellar app. It's a classic Final Fantasy/ Secret Of Mana RPG. I haven't completed the game, but I can't seem to stop playing it.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Many reviewers have already outlined the plot, so I won't duplicate their efforts. Suffice it to say that this is a terrific book. The book is written for teenagers or young adults, but I found it completely readable and thoroughly enjoyable, especially because the author used a different approach and told the story from the horse's point of view. I'm looking forward to the movie, because with Spielberg's golden touch, it should be a winner.
B004SDEP38|4.0|This is a pretty good office app. One thing I don't like about some other apps is that you have to buy the HD version to be compatible with your tablet.

B0036TGT3E|5.0|I love this movie, I am a dad and my son loves it too! We are huge fans of animated movies, I'm more of a convert since my son started watching these with me and I'm trying to build my collection and pre-ordered this when Disney released the diamond edition recently! Storyline, screenplay and animation are all top class and good reasons for you to invest in this, but for my 2 year old the real kicker is the soundtrack, he loves the songs and the colors and the silly dances!<br /><br />I love watching this with my son, have seen it at least 3 times now since I first saw it in theater! His other favorite was Cars (he was Lightning Mcqueen for this Halloween) but now I think Simba (or Pumba) has topped the list in his mind and toppled L.McQueen!<br /><br />I love watching this now even more, after becoming a dad, this is actually a movie about a dad's love for his son and how that shapes him to be the King that he is! Even if most of us watching this would not be kings in real life (I'm just guessing here :)) you would be able to relate to this movie instantly! Well the script and the story are the reasons why I love it, but that is not all of it!<br /><br />The animation is mind blowing and the details with which this is done rivals any of the new age animated movies, 1080p quality and 5.1 channel surround sound is fantastic! But the real reason a 2 years old child would love this, as i mentioned above, is because of the fantastic soundtrack and the silly dances!<br /><br />So certainly a great buy for any one who likes animated movies and any household where little kids dictates what  movies you watch on a weekend or movie night!
B005UT29Z0|5.0|An excellent film with fabulous performances by all the actors.    The start of the film was a moving portrayal by Stan Tucci of a man laid off.  I enjoyed all the performances.  It is an important story about how the world of finance is so unstable, and the lives it leaves destroyed with not another thought.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|\\"Here And Now\\" by Nickelback highlights a strong musical debut since the Dark Horse album.  I personally enjoyed the Dark Horse collection, and have found \\"Here and Now\\" to be even better.  \\"Here and Now\\" contains some fun and catchy rock tracks that beg for radio airplays and potential music videos.  The following is my humble opinion on the analysis of these tracks and their meanings:<br />1. This Means War 9/10: This song starts the collection off pretty strong. It appears to be about having a tenacious and fighting spirit even in the face of opposition.<br />2. Bottoms Up 9/10: This is an anthem that clearly symbolizes having fun.  This track would be an obvious choice for a gathering involving drinking and partying.<br />3. When We Stand Together 10/10: \\"When We Stand Together\\" is a very heartfelt musical tune about being united and helping one another out whenever possible.  In my humble opinion, \\"When We Stand Together\\" is very relevant for what is currently happening through the media and other channels.<br />4. Midnight Queen 10/10: \\"Midnight Queen\\" is a fun song about meeting up with someone who knows how to enjoy the nightlife, and is uninhibited.<br />5. Gotta Get Me Some 10/10: \\"Gotta Get Me Some\\" denotes a catchy musical tune about a woman who is gifted with beauty, a happy spirit, and knows how to make the best of life.<br />6. Lullaby 10/10: \\"Lullaby\\" is a very beautiful song about having the emotional strength to carry on regardless of how challenging life may get.  In addition, \\"Lullaby\\" appears to be a touching message about being aware that help is always available, and that life circumstances can always improve.<br />7. Kiss It Goodbye 9/10: \\"Kiss It Goodbye\\" is a very racy tune about the trials and tests for breaking into Hollywood life. I can easily see \\"Kiss It Goodbye\\" as a theme song to a reality show about aspiring superstars.<br />8. Trying Not to Love You 10/10: \\"Trying Not to Love You\\" is a compelling musical story about fighting uncontrollable feelings of love for someone else. In addition, \\"Trying Not to Love You\\" appears to be about the love growing stronger for someone even if the admirer tries to forget.<br />9. Holding On to Heaven 10/10: \\"Holding On to Heaven\\" is a gorgeous rock melody about being in a relationship with someone that brings a blissful and heaven on earth experience.<br />10. Everything I Wanna Do 10/10: \\"Everything I Do\\" is a great rock song about spending time with a person that is very carefree, wild, and fun-loving.<br />11. Don't Ever Let It End: 9.5/10: \\"Don't Ever Let It End\\" is an uplifting rock ballad about enjoying the weekend with a pleasant person who is so enjoyable to be around. \\"Don't Ever Let It End\\" appears to symbolize the time spent as being so happy that the singer does not want the experience to end so soon.<br />I am completely aware that others may have different ratings and/or opinions on the following songs.  However, in my modest opinion any of the following six songs would make for good radio play, concert songs, and/or music videos: Midnight Queen, Gotta Get Me Some, Lullaby, Trying Not to Love You, Holding On to Heaven, and Everything I Wanna Do.<br />As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, I enjoyed the Dark Horse album, and like \\"Here and Now\\" even more.  \\"Here and Now\\" also compares to \\"All the Right Reasons\\" in a positive and exciting way.  In addition, \\"Here and Now\\" shows the musical growth of Nickelback and how their creative output keeps getting better. \\"Here and Now\\" is definitely recommended for anyone that enjoys any of the songs from \\"All the Right Reasons\\" and/or \\"Dark Horse.\\"r someone else. In addition, \\"Trying Not to Love You\\" appears to be about the love growing stronger for someone even if the admirer tries to forget.  9.

There were at least two parts of the story that needed to be developed more, and I think the movie would have been greatly improved.

1932735410|5.0|I passed PMP just by reading this book (6th edition of this book).  Very nicely written with real world examples.  This book alone is enough to pass the exam.  Some people go through CDs, PMBOK guide, etc., however, I do not see any need for them.<br /><br />Rita covers many things even the topics PMBOK guide doesn't cover.  She also points out where you may lack experience/knowledge or where you may make mistakes/false assumptions, etc.<br /><br />If you want to pass the exam first time, you may want to do the following:<br /><br />Make sure that you read the book very thoroughly first time (do not skip or browse pages).<br />Complete every practice exam at the end of the chapter without looking at the answers.  For better results, you may want to solve 10 questions at a time and verify your answers and Rita's explanation and move on to the next set of questions.  This way, you get the command on the concepts and do the next related questions better.  If you wait to verify the answers after all questions are done, you may have done many questions wrong because of a simple misunderstanding of a concept.<br /><br />Book your exam two to three weeks in advance once you finish Risk Management chapter.  You will still have Procurement management, etc. chapter but you will be able to finish the rest in time as you have more reasons to finish because of the added motivation booking the exam.<br /><br />In the last two days before the exam, go back and review main concepts in each chapter just by browsing them and complete each review exam again without looking at the answers!<br /><br />Make sure that you are able to finish 40 questions under 40 minutes!!  The problem on the exam is not just not knowing the answers but to answer them in time.

It is a hybrid format that includes both a game and the movie.  So I can't play just the movie portion of this disk.    I suppose I can upgrade my version of Cyberlink software for $$$, but I think I'll save my money for a new consumer Blu-ray player.  In the meantime, I can't play this disk.  Buyer beware.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|I'm very pleased with the Camera Connection Kit. I shoot 16 megapixel RAW images on my Nikon D7000 and I wanted to be able to pull these into the iPad and edit them. I can say that this is an important element of that equation. I downloaded Photogene from the App store and it was able to read the full sized RAW files and edit them quickly, easily and effortlessly. Honestly, except for detail touch-up, this does everything that I usually do in Photoshop. And (for me and my photos, at least) Better!  If you're interested in getting your images into the iPad for editing, be sure that your application is compatible. If so, you will find this tool a staple.
B004EPYZTE|1.0|not at all the hardcore battle movie i had expected.  - casting is not very good; the actor for the young conan is not even the same nationality as the adult conan nor even the actors playing his father and mother. plus, he's way too smallish to believe he'll grow into the giant body of conan. The mature Conan is even worse, looks like a model for JC Pennys  - Production and Direction is poor, from the opening sequence when a eleven year old conan at 70-lbs beats and kills a party of battle hardened barbarians....  the unrealism continues through the battles as you see a horseman get shot with an arrow the horse is thrown backward from a full gallop; in another scene a heavily armored wagon is thrown thirty feet into the air when the harness from the team of horses is broke in battle... 110-lb women throwing around 250-lb barbarians in battle, who knows why they couldn't cast better actors; these directors didn't even try.  - Make-up, and FX are poor; throughout the movie you'll get the feeling the actors all just got out of the salon... hair-do's are all heavily shampooed and conditioned, and after months pass in the story where the characters continue their quest, they remain clean and freshly shaven...  this looks like a movie made for television.

B005PTQPU0|1.0|I'm quite an admirer of Kate Bush: in the late 70s and early 80s she was an astounding talent whose lyrics exhibited a well-read and truly artistic mind. So it's disappointing to find her releasing an album consisting almost entirely of monotonous piano pieces which sound like they're trying to imitate the Tori Amos of 'Under the Pink'. (And falling far, far short.)<br /><br />Take, for example, the title track. Where to begin with this? Actor Stephen Fry takes time off from tweeting about being stuck in an elevator or (more recently) on a grounded passenger jet to deliver yet another sequence of staccato inanities. The chorus requires Kate to interrupt his snow-lexicon with the lyrics \\"Come on man, you've got 44 to go ...\\". It doesn't pass the cringe test. And unfortunately the famous notion that the Eskimos have fifty words for snow has long been exposed as a myth: Anthony Woodbury identified 15 such words and demonstrated that they all have analogues in English such as sleet, drift, blizzard, and - appropriately for this track - slush. So that was a waste of an idea.<br /><br />The CD has the feel of a concept album in that it's 65 minutes in length but features just seven tracks. Thus I had the niggling suspicion when I bought it that each tune might wind up taking its time. And how! It's fine for an album to *begin* with a slow, meditative piano piece; but as the hour drifts by and it becomes apparent that the album consists of *nothing but* ponderous keyboard-tinkling, the listener's patience wears thin. It's like being stuck in an elevator. With Stephen Fry.<br /><br />I do worry about the artistic pedigree of the company Kate Bush is keeping: there's no way I would have bought this album if I knew that at one point Elton John's voice would come crooning through the speakers like an intruder at a Karaoke party. I admire the fact that after all these years Kate Bush is 'still going' (she very much belongs on today's music scene) - but it's a bad move for her to duet with singers who should be long gone.<br /><br />The verdict? If you find yourself past the midway point of an album and you're still waiting for it to start, you know you've been had. This is a weak effort from someone who can do way better.d be long gone.

I am walking away feeling completely fulfilled in what I have learned and am very excited to learn even more.<br /><br />I am going through the Swords suite in the Minor Arcana. As a new learner, I would highly recommend this to others as well.

B000Y11BAS|4.0|I am not a fan of Madonna but she did a great job in the movie Evita.  I am a fan of Salma Hayek and she did a great job in Frida as well, though the movie is not quite as strong as Evita.  Two women, unique individuals, unabashedly following their own destiny with stories that both enlighten and entertain.  Artistically, Evita is the strongest, with the music and storytelling hitting a very smooth pace.  Intellectually and historically, though, Frida is my favorite. A woman who survived, loved and suffered for it, created and inspired. She did not simply follow, but would if she chose too. She led her own life, one that was neither easy nor conventional.  Of the two, Frida is one of my favorite women while Evita was interesting, but without the redeeming qualities of art and passion.
B005F96URI|5.0|In the post apocalyptic world guns are outlawed, swords are used. A district/town is run by Nicola (Ron Perlman). He has an army of killers known as Reds because the dress in red. Kevin McKidd plays Killer #2 the strong arm for Nicola. He has the ability of Uma Thurman in \\"Kill Bill.\\" The people dress in gray...guess what they're called? Woody Harrelson is Little West Town's bartender at the Horseless Horseman. He is known as \\"The Bartender.\\" One day a drifter comes to town...known as \\"The Drifter.\\" He looks like Leonardo DiCaprio and wants to get into a high stakes card game. The sets has that surreal CG look that we originally saw in \\"Dick Tracy.\\" The scenes are all done on a stage.<br /><br />In a subplot, another stranger named Yoshi (Gackt Camui) comes to town. He is looking to avenge his father by taking back a golden dragon talisman. Both men have the ability to fight multiple trained fighters at one time without breaking a sweat. They bump heads at the Horseless Horseman and decide to join forces against Nicola and his red suit fighters as a cowboy without a gun and samurai without a sword.<br /><br />The film is something Quinton Tarantino might have done growing up watching \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.\\" It has cartoon segments, numbers dropping down by people, extreme amount of fighting, and quirky humor. Woody Harrelson provides us with philosophy and pop-up books. If you like weird action films and Scott Pilgrim type of movie, this one will blow you away. The dialouge is filled with symbolism, metaphors, and double entendres. \\"The fight is not about who's right, but who's left.\\"<br /><br />The film makes full use of the soundtrack.<br />Bravo to relative new comer Guy Moshe.<br /><br />F-bomb (Demi Moore is in it), no sex or nudity.

B004EPYZTE|5.0|You know, if you aren't familiar with a genre or a character therein, do yourself and the rest of the civilized world a favor and DON'T WATCH THESE PARTICULAR FILMS! It really isn't as complicated as splitting atoms!   What film did you haters see? How about you misbegotten charlatans and frauds who are well-known \\"critics\\" that are just bitter you could never get a script of your own made into a feature? Because if you saw Conan, you should at least have a sprinkling of a grasp of Conan and his world and how the stories are fleshed out from the pulp novels of nearly a century ago and comic books from decades ago when fantasy and fiction COULD be told in the manner this film unravels.  \\"The mask angle was stupid!\\" \\"The sorcery angle was stupid!\\" \\"He's mean to females!\\" Yep, that's how the vibe for the stories has ALWAYS been, and Nispel clearly did his homework, but hey, feel free to complain over nonsense!  This one's cute, too: \\"Him and his father train with swords on ICE! What a rip-off of Batman Begins!!!\\" Yeah, and I'm sure no other film in human history had two people training on ice before Batman Begins came out just a handful of years ago, right? For example, no martial arts film from any country anywhere anytime, I'm sure! Sigh, Americans, that's all I'm going to say!  There's also \\"It looks like a made-for-TV movie!\\" No, it does not. At all. That's just a feeble attempt to try and further smear the film in much the same way the comment I mentioned in the previous paragraph is. It isn't based on anything factual and is the product of complete and utter cluelessness. People who say such unfounded foolishness are outright delusional, there's really no Option B about it.  To conclude, the characters/locations/scenarios are straight out of the Conan stories of yesteryear (again, something you should have probably wrapped your head around in advance before stepping one foot in the theater), it's perfectly paced, the action is literally nonstop, the costumes andset pieces are as good as any fantasy movie not associated with Tolkien, and it looks and sounds absolutely stunning. But hey, there's a vampire film also playing so the trendy teenager in you can rejoice and there's that apes movie that was about as exciting as watching water freeze and had the most wooden, annoying, and deadbeat characters of any film this summer yet you somehow vouch for it as \\"The best movie of the year!\\"  And ultimately, let's face facts; if it were to the letter the EXACT same film but Johnny Depp played Conan or it was directed by Peter Jackson or Quentin Tarantino, you'd eat it up, possibly more than once. Because that's how shallow and biased in advance filmgoing audiences have become. Pathetic! Much like that large contingency of people who indiscriminately watch any and all things anime simply because they come from Japan, but if they were exact same thing and the country of origin was say, Zimbabwe, they wouldn't touch it with a boomerang tied to a fire hose! Yep, admit it, your logic is preferential in exactly in the same manner!

My major in college was history, so of course when I saw this was coming out I preordered on my kindle.  I was absolutely stunned with how King made the 50's and early 60's come alive.  I was reading it on my iPad as well as my kindle even though it is much easier on my eyes to read the eink.  I just couldn't put it down so when I had my iPad out to check email or something I couldn't resist going on the app (telling myself I'd just read a few pages rather than go upstairs to my bedroom to retrieve my Kindle)and of course then I was hooked.  I'm just in awe of King's talent and imagination and was really sorry when I finished the book.  I haven't read a lot of King, but I enjoyed Under the Dome, and liked 11/22/63 even more.  Worth every penny.

0446364495|1.0|He's a national geographic photographer (formerly a war photographer), who thinks of himself as one of the 'last cowboys' with a range of the entire world (he'll go anywhere for a picture).  She's an Iowan who used to live in Italy, and she hasn't had good sex for years.  He's attracted to her, and she accepts.  Descriptions of cameras, how he is a vegetarian, yet smokes (and gets her to smoke again too).  He's a strong man who can control his strength, and she's a grown woman who realizes that yes, she can feel attractive at her age of fifty-seven.  Romantic, only she's married!  This isn't explored with any sense of morality.  The affair concludes, and that's that.  Found it funny the author kept describing Kincaid's manliness like great jungle cats, but could hardly spare a word for Francisca being a woman.  She was just 'there' to be made love to in a submissive sense.  I hear the movie is better because it has actual character development, and I don't recommend the book, unless you are reading it aloud and making fun of it.  Waller enjoys overblown adjectives and adverbs.  Textbook purple prose.  But if you are a woman in her fifties and this is the only book you read in a decade, you'll probably like it... Waller didn't write it for sophisticated readers, he wrote it for normal folks who rarely read.  But I'm not one of those people.  As an avid reader, I see only the multitude of flaws littering this book.

B005JLN9Z8|4.0|L.A.-based band Steel Panther bring back the fun of the 1980's Glam bands to a whole new generation with the look, sound and feel of the Sunset Strip days and in some ways just as good maybe even better. When Feel The Steel was released in 2009, I couldn't stop listening to it, the songs were catchy, fun and melodic and it was one of my favorite albums that year. Two years later Steel Panther release their follow up album, the promising Balls Out. I wouldn't say it's quite the same level as Feel The Steel but Balls Out continues with the same humor and elements that made love the band to begin with, so no sophomore slump here thankfully. A solid second album all the way through. I loved the first album so much I feared that the second time around the jokes would be tired or perhaps not as funny or maybe the music wouldn't be up to par with the debut but from the first listen my fears and doubts vanished completely. The Panther is back bringing metal to the masses. I already have a few favorites in songs like \\"17 Girls In A Row\\", \\"If You Really, Really Love Me\\", \\"Tomorrow Night\\" and \\"Let Me Come In\\".<br /><br />\\"In The Future\\" is basically Balls Out's version of Motley Crue's \\"In The Beginning\\" piece which opened their classic Shout At The Devil album. When the voice says \\"In the year 6969...\\"you know where things are headed (no puns intended). \\"Supersonic Sex Machine\\" is album's first real song and it gets things off to a rocking start, a good fast and energetic rocker. Not a standout but still a pretty good and fun song. \\"17 Girls In A Row\\" is instantly catchy even with its at times absurd lyrics. This is a nominee for best song of the album, everything works for this song: the vocal delivery, the lyrics...and that riff!\\"If You Really, Really Love Me\\" is a slow rocker that borders power ballad territory and it may be the best song of the album. It's catchy and everything Steel Panther preaches and stands for, plus it's probably the one I play most. I love the gang vocals on \\"Gold Digging Whore\\". \\"Let Me Come In\\" is another favorite, I love the build up to the breakdown and the fury that is unleashed afterwards terrific energy I love it. Balls Out ends on soft yet high note with the closing ballad \\"Weenie Ride\\". It's a soft piano-driven ballad that's a highlight for its cleverly dirty lyrics (\\"All you gotta is ditch your boyfriend and give sexy Michael Starr a call...\\")Feel The Steel had some guest appearance from people like Scott Ian (Anthrax), Corey Taylor (Slipknot) and M Shadows (Avenged Sevenfold). Balls Out features less appearances but Chad Kroeger (Nickelback), love him or hate him has a pretty cool spot on \\"It Won't Suck Itself\\".<br /><br />I'm amazed that Steel Panther managed to come up once again with a full album's worth of sexual humor, drug jokes and powerful music to back it up and that it all works out perfectly for the second time. Satchel's guitar work on the album is terrific, the riffs the solos he comes up with, he really shines on this album and is the key. Michael Starr's voice sounds better than on the first album, even if it already sounded great. Stixx Zadinia proves once more to be a very competent drummer with some excellent drum work and fills. Lexxxi Foxxxis just happy to look good and play bass.<br /><br />Some of my friends aren't fans of the Glam/Hair bands like I am but they still find something to like in Steel Panther. Even Anthrax's Scott Ian said he hated all the Glam bands but he loves Steel Panther and thinks Feel The Steel is an amazing album (he contributed guitars on \\"Asian Hooker\\" too). There are people who call Steel Panther a joke band etc, saying that the band is immature and so on but the music is great and they're a fun band to listen to, although I will admit their kind of humor is not for everyone and some won't \\"get it\\". I get a lot more enjoyment out of this \\"joke\\" band than most of today's music to be honest. If you enjoyed their first album I really don't see why you wouldn't like this one, its once more great metal sprinkled with some fun crude humor done quite well. Feel The Steel blew me away in 2009, I wasn't prepared. Balls Out is very close, a great album on its own and the band delivers the second time around with the songs still being funny and rockin', 4/5. NOT for the easily offended.more great metal sprinkled with some fun crude humor done quite well. Feel The Steel blew me away in 2009, I wasn't prepared.

1401233376|5.0|I have always been a fan of the DC Universe since I was little kid. They had a huge playground of characters and universes for you to choose from. At times it was downright confusing but it was fun nonetheless. Over the last twenty of so years (Hard to Believe it has been that long). DC has been trying to cleanse the confusion caused by their massive continuity begining with the awesome and critically accalimed [[ASIN:1563897504 Crisis On Infinite Earths]] then the mediocre [[ASIN:1563891840 Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]] and then the very cool [[ASIN:1401210600 Infinite Crisis]] Despite all of that it really did not do much to deal with the confusion. Fans would debate what story was in continuity and did this happen or that happen. First Batman was a part of the Justice League then he wasn't and then he was. First he discovered who killed Thomas and Martha Wayne then it was a mystery. First he was known somewhat by the public then he became an Urban Legened. You get my point. First Wonder Woman was not a founder of the JLA then later on she was. Many of Supermans John Byrne adventures were wiped out. It got ridiculous. Not to mention Hawkman. (Check out the [[ASIN:1401232221 The Hawkman Omnibus Vol. 1]] to help clear up that confusion.  Unless you have been reading consistently for 20 years you may have missed out on those confusing and convoluted moments.<br /><br />The point is (no pun intended) Flashpoint is designed to restart that and in some ways I think pay homage to everything that came before it. I loved this book. I loved the Kubert art and the crazy plot. I highly recommend it. It's interesting how Barry Allen died in the original Crisis which changed the old universe and he is now the catalyst for the changes that result in this new universe which by the way is very very cool. Please check out the [[ASIN:1401234518 DC Comics: The New 52]] Many of the titles are awesome. Check out your local comics shop for more information. The highlights of this story include Batman and the radical changes to Aquaman, Wonderwoman, and Superman. Many fans were angry about the changes but I was not.

0765365278|5.0|I found the book to be fast paced and engrossing from the first page. A very well made world. The only problem I have with it is that the author is working on so many other books at the same time it may be a while before we have a part two. Maybe he should get with Patrick Rothfuss and they could stagger their books so it wouldn't seem so long in between:) Great book and highly recommended.

0374532990|5.0|There are as many reasons to admire this book as there are entries to the High Line. So I'll give you nine.<br /><br />1. It's inspirational: a true David and Goliath story, set in post 9/11 New York City, featuring two guys who admit quite charmingly in these pages that they had no idea what they were doing. And they won.<br /><br />2. It's spot-on, Zeitgeist-wise: if you're even remotely interested in the movement of urban landscape design that is sweeping major cities around the world, David & Hammond have just given you the playbook. This book tells the full story of how these two young men, with lots of help from a wide variety of people and over a ten year period, navigated the neighborhood, city, state, corporate, and Federal politics to create this park.<br /><br />3. If you love New York...: this a book that will help you understand how and why it works as well as it does under the leadership of Mayor Bloomberg.<br /><br />4. It has that magical element that non-fiction readers love: voice. These two guys, in alternating paragraphs, each come across as distinct personalities and as they tell their story we come to know them as individuals. There are other key characters who come alive, including Gifford Miller and the extraordinary Amanda Burden, a woman who has done something I will always be grateful for: she has made New York a better city.<br /><br />5. It's unsparingly honest. Serious readers know when they're being jollied along, and these guys give us everything, warts and all: their disagreements and crises of faith and plenty of unpretty moments, like a hangover that could have derailed an important meeting.<br /><br />6. Marvelous, excruciating detail. Example: Hammond provides the color swatch for the Sherwin-Williams paint color of the High Line's railings: SW6994. It's called \\"Greenblack,\\" and you too can use it in your own kitchen, just as he did.<br /><br />7. The photos are gorgeous.<br /><br />8. It's a cautionary tale: on every page you marvel that the thing actually got built, that these men didn't get derailed.<br /><br />9. The High Line, the glorious \\"park in the sky.\\" What's not to love? Here's a book that celebrates both the creation -- in all its gritty, gnarly detail -- and the end result: a park that always inspires, always leaves room for dreaming.<br /><br />I've been writing about the High Line for three and a half years on my blog, LivinTheHighLine.com, and I was surprised that I learned something on just about every page of this book.

B003H9MSPG|3.0|When opening the box, my first thought was, wow, this is ridiculously huge. Something so obnoxiously large must be effective. However, after putting it together, loading the cartridge system, which seems like a terrible idea, and trying to take a shot with the extended barrel on, the darts practically fall out of the gun. Very disappointing. If you take of the extra barrel, it works reasonable well, but is not accurate at all. I understand you can make some modifications to it, but in its present state, I would have been better off buying a 10 dollar nerf gun.
0439023521|5.0|On a friend's recommendation, I downloaded first novel of The Hunger Game series.  I read it in a little over a a day and was enthralled through most of the novel.  The novel tackles several interesting ideas related to war, personal sacrifice, and individuals' flaws.  Despite some heavier material to cover, it was written in a way where the reader could lose themselves in the story.    I would strongly encourage this novel for anyone looking for an interesting story to sit back and enjoy.
0307472841|3.0|I normally love Henning Mankell's books (especially the Wallander series), but this book is just too preachy. I've always known Mankell was a socialist, but I didn't think he was a blatant commmunist (the difference being that a socialist wants state control for the good of the people, while communists want state control for the good of the state). There's so much \\"I hate capitalism, let's support communism\\" in this book that it ruins what otherwise would be a really good story. At one point Mankell's own views actually suggest we should admire Zimbabwe dictator Robert Mugabe. Sure, he had numerous thousands of people killed, but hey, it was all for the common good, right? The same goes for Mao. Mankell is becoming a bitter old man who's letting his own warped ideas affect his crime novels.

B005QBKXSC|4.0|Five years removed from the release of the fastest-selling debut rock album, Daughtry's third effort gives the impression the band is trying to equal the success of that 4x platinum record.  And, after selling ONLY a little over a million copies of the follow-up Leave This Town, it makes sense to go back to producing more short and sweet, radio-ready tunes with familiar melodies and soaring choruses.  Break The Spell is a collection of songs that go light with the rock, heavy on the adult contemporary, mid-tempo ballads; eschewing experimentation with other genres entirely (no country-flavored tunes like \\"Tennessee Line\\" found here).  Other than the straight-forward rocker \\"Renegade\\" and parts of \\"Outta My Head\\" and \\"Louder Than Ever\\", heavy guitars take a back seat to clean electrics with less edge; Chris' passionate, wide-ranging vocals are front and center this time around.  Actually, it's a very similar formula to Leave This Town, only this time there are several songs with the potential for major commercial success.  Simply put, the first time you hear this record you get instant gratification, as familiarity breeds comfort, and these relatable tunes should reach a much wider audience because of it.  Chris and his bandmates did most of the songwriting with little outside collaboration, so perhaps that may be why many of these songs sound similar to each other.  It's difficult for me to declare favorites because of these similarities, but the songs \\"Start Of Something Good\\", \\"We're Not Gonna Feel\\", \\"Gone Too Soon\\", \\"Losing My Mind\\" and \\"Rescue Me\\" are all top-notch; with interesting verses, catchy, melodic choruses that climb to the top of Cris' vocal range, and lyrics that will hit home for a lot of people.  If there's a negative to this album, it would be the lack of any extra-special songs that you could never forget.  I would have loved one of those rare ballads that would really reach into my gut and rip my heart out.  And with so many songs sounding the same, there's the potential for this album to get old too fast.  Daughtry may have played it a little safe with Break The Spell, but that won't stop me from enjoying what it has to offer for what I hope will be a long time to come.
B005D9B26E|1.0|contains four CDs, a DVD and a vinyl seven inch single. This box set gives a unique insight into the creation of this landmark album and features a remaster of the original double album, Pete Townshend's previously unheard demos including songs that didn't make it onto the original album, an exclusive eight track 5.1 sound DVD, a deluxe hard-back book, previously unseen personal notes, photographs, memorabilia and other exclusive material.   Is this really worth to pay $126.00 and more to get the above?  NO, I am so glad Ihave the Mobile Fidelity version which uses a first generation tape from Pete Townsend own collection.  If you think it's worth it, you must be a real die hard Who fan  Give us the music not all these little trinkets, they said only eight of the songs were available for the 5.1 sound, sad.

B004EPZ084|1.0|This movie belongs on the same trash heap as Brides Maids and the like. I really loved Jennifer Aniston in Friends and so much wanted to be a fan of her movies, but most of them just aren't any good. Few exceptions - I really liked The Breakup. Though I found The Good Girl depressing and wouldn't watch it a second time, her acting was good. But why is it that lately anything labeled as a romantic comedy is just crude and trashy? Is that really what most people want to watch? In my opinion, this sort of script is for actors who are on the way out. It requires no acting skills, and little in the way of real vocabulary. I used to be willing to rent or buy a movie just because Jen was in it, but no more. I don't trust her ability to pick good scripts. Is she really going to be proud of her work when she looks back on a carrer filled with this kind of trash script? If she's just in it for the money and doesn't care, then I guess it doesn't matter as long as the check doesn't bounce.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|I went to the park with the hounds. got on the swing. closed my eyes and listened to this album. This album is not intelligent pop music. What often passes as intelligent pop music sounds similar to someone digitally farting into your sound system for forty or so minutes. hardly worth one's time and money. Again, this is not intelligent pop music. But this, this is kately, it's katesque, it's poetry in motion. It's not what she says but how she says it and how she says it when she says it. One...Two...Three....just listen-- Brian
B005N0PJJO|3.0|Ok; I was totally green about this book.  Personally, I'm not comfortable with the \\"games\\" the lead character liked to play.  I found myself bypassing those portions of the book.

Update July 2014:  After reading many more books in the past few years, I still cannot believe that I keep coming back to this book.  It is not just a book for amateur but also a quick reference for many basic things about vedic astrology.

1451629184|2.0|I brought this book out of curiosity. I wanted to understand the story of Jaycee Dugard and what she endured. The book itself was okay. Written by a young woman who still sounds like a child, it is not written very well and also extremely repetitive. A short read. Not necessarily worth it, in my opinion.

B0053YGYO4|1.0|It's sad but this album is the weakest from Coldplay. There's no song that would thrill me at all. Princess of China is such an annoying song that I had to skip it after few seconds listening to it. And before someone calls me a Rihanna's hatter, I didn't know it was her singing until I researched that later. It was such a boring album that I couldn't even pay much attention when I was listening to it. It's disappointing that they have chosen to pursue this bland pop style seeking for a broader audience in detriment of what originally defines them Coldplay. This can be easily verified when we see Princess of China in this album while Moving to Mars was left out. I just doesn't make sense at all.  I agree that every band should innovate over time. Radiohead did that and I still appreciate their music. However, IMHO, Coldplay changed to something worse throughout their career.
B001GWK2MC|1.0|After reading reviews of this product on Amazon, I decided to take my chances. Although someone complained leak problems, but seems some others are OK.<br /><br />The product shipped on Oct 02, and I had a leak in two weeks. No problem, I patched the leak. Then in a week, a leak again, and I patched again.<br /><br />Then 2 weeks ago, another leak, and we could not find where the leak was. At that point I wanted to give it up anyway. So I contacted the seller. Bummer, it passed the return period for few days. Hadn't I tried to save this product, I would return it the first week. I emailed the seller windy city sports, and they said, NO.<br /><br />My sister bought one for her son. Luckily she returned in a week because of leak problem.<br /><br />I completely lost faith in this product.

B0051GOB26|5.0|I mainly bought this limited edition blu-ray because I only had the full frame DVD version (I accidentally bought full frame at Wal-Mart.  I was distracted by the low price.  Damn you, Waltons!).  Anyway, I was very pleased with this purchase.  Not only can I now watch this fantastic film in full 1080p widescreen, but the special features are excellent too.  I learned a lot about the making of the film from the entertaining documentaries.    The clips from the Lebowski Fest documentary sold me on the cult status of the movie.  And the gimmicky U-Control \\"Mark It, Dude\\" feature, that counts the F-bombs and \\"dudes\\" and whatnot is completely unnecessary but amusing nonetheless.  I also enjoy the book that's built into the case, which has some great trivia for fans, some interviews, and even the recipe for a \\"Caucasian\\".  And the digital copy of the movie is nice for those who need to get their \\"Dude\\" fix on the go.  I recommend this blu-ray edition of The Big Lebowski to anyone who hasn't seen the movie, anyone who was a dumbass and bought the full screen DVD like me, super-fans who need every special feature, or movie geeks who are working on upgrading their collections from DVD to blu-ray.
B004EI3ON4|2.0|Most of the quality of the soundtrack is on the level of dreamy/reverberant synth/orchestral sound design and their intelligent blending.  There are a lot of repeated synth-note pulses, emotion-laden chord sequences, broad hymn-lines with added noises from orchestral percussion/taiko drums, slow moving textures with occasional dramatic buildups.  However, compared to the rich quirkiness of the original TRON soundtrack, the musical substance of Daft Punk's production collapses to almost nothing, especially on repeated listenings.  Don't get me wrong, I really like Daft Punk as such and the comparison to Wendy Carlos is of course unfair, but after listening to this for a while, I realized that this soundtrack might in fact be a major reason for the lack of emotional connection I had to the film.  Things oscillate between aggressive/menacing/overwhelming pulsation and tragic/melancholic darkness. The overall attitude of this soundtrack seems to be a \\"trancing out\\" of emotions. Instead of the perceptual shocks and high density of surprise elements that drove the original TRON over the brink of incoherence, we are now made to relax and accept everything as if in a subdued emptied state of hypnosis generated by repetitive patterns.  The new movie felt like it wanted to tell a story of great depth, but in the end everything appeared strangely flat and permeated with things I seemed to have seen 1000 times before.  I was wondering if an aspect of this experience was due to the fact that emotional or dynamic detail or cognitively uplifting accents are blanketed under the language of comparably glacial musical minimalism throughout this soundtrack.  Definitely not in the legacy of the original, but it's of course also a matter of taste.  As a music lover, I could in any case not get myself as excited about it as many other reviewers on here.  The TRON adagio made me sigh.... \\"Oh Tron! Where did all your gladiatorial fruitiness go!\\" :)

0756405890|3.0|The Name of the Wind is a coming-of-age story representing the first part of a multi-part series.  Presumably, the latter parts will involve a more mature hero and are likely to develop into a hero's journey.  How many parts there will be eventually in the series, considering how ornate, inconclusive, and meandering the writing is, remains anybody's guess.    The hero lives in an environment somewhat reminiscent of a mix between European Renaissance and Camelot with a number of only partially introduced cultures and peoples.  World building is adequate, but that's it.  The story itself hinges on the quest to track down some notorious creatures of semi-mythical nature who have been the cause of much sorrow for the young hero.  The author is not one to say with two words what can be said with three.  Or four.  The story of the main character, who is in fact an interesting individual, is narrated in a style that is overly narcisistic and draws unnecessary attention to the writing.  Also, the prose has point-of-view errors when switching from the third person to the omniscent perspective:  It attempts to engage the reader in a manner that is disruptive of the reader's dream.  Frankly I'm having a hard time justifying the apparent success of this book.  Compared to the writer's art of, say, Neuromancer, or the painful reality of Ender's Game, this is watered down writing of ordinary vintage with baroque ambitions that are expressed, but never mastered.  Perhaps this is something a juvenile public may appreciate, who knows.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|As others have mentioned, this is a fantastic version of Jane Eyre. Masterpiece Theater chose wonderful actors and actresses and laid it out perfectly. I've read the classic about four times and feel the producers hit it on the head.<br /><br />I purchased the DVD in 2011 and while I'm not a big extra or special feature nut, I still like to watch them once - usually after my first time through the movie. I enjoy the behind the scenes look at filming, actor selection, stunt scenes, etc.<br /><br />BUT - in order to see those things I have to take the DVD-CD and bring it to my computer. They are not accessible on your TV. Bummer. Call me lazy, but I really wish I could see them from the comfort of my couch and not while sitting at my desk. Even though I've had this DVD for a while I still haven't watched them on my computer. I'm also wondering if they are just still pictures or reading material. Hmm I don't want to read about the production details - I want to see extras. If I ever view them I will update this review. The main point is they are not available in ways we are all used to seeing - which is a little bothersome.<br /><br />The lack of extras and special feature is only one small drawback of this wonderful offering.
0743297334|4.0|Rat-a-tat... Hemingway's prose comes out at a staccato pace in The Sun Also Rises.  One can imagine black and white scenes of a 1930's or 1040's movies with an actors, Humphrey Bogart for instance clipped voice reading the dialogue:<br /><br />\\"I walked up the road and got out the two bottles of wine.  They were cold.  Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back on the trees.  I spread the lunch on a newspaper, and uncorked the bottles and leaned the other against a tree.  Bill came up drying his hands, his bag plump with ferns.<br />\\"Let see that bottle,\\" he said.  he pulled the cork, and tipped up the bottle and drank.  \\"Whew!  That makes my eyes ache.\\"<br />\\"Let's try it.\\"<br />The wine was icy cold and tasted faintly rusty.<br />\\"That;s not such filthy wine,\\"Bill said.<br />\\"The cold helps it,\\" I said.  We unwrapped the Little parcels of lunch.<br />\\"Chicken.\\"<br />\\"There's hard-boiled eggs.\\"<br />\\"Find any salt?\\"<br />First the egg, said Bill.  \\"Then the chicken.  Even Bryan could see that.\\"<br />\\"He's dead.  I read it in the paper yesterday.\\"<br />\\"No. Not really?\\"<br />\\"Yes Bryan's dead.\\"<br />\\"Gentlemen,\\" he said and unwrapped a drumstick from a piece of newspaper.  \\"I reverse the order.  For Bryan's sake.  As a tribute to the Great commoner.  First the chicken;then the egg.\\"<br /><br />Hemingway worked meticulously at crafting his writing, whittling it down to the bare essence and The Sun Also Rises his first novel is a perfect example of this there are no extra phrases and much is left to the readers imagination, even Jake Barnes war injury which left him impotent is rarely mentioned but always a integral part of the story.  It is so stripped down that it is accessible to all with no need to get out the dictionary, although much is left for the reader to fill in.<br /><br />While Hemingway deftly crafts his characters, he does so with spare brush strokes, so much is left for the reader to fill in and life's experiences will shape how the reader perceives each.  Essentially there are four major character Jake Barnes the impotent writer/journalist, Brett, Lady Ashley, the twice married dissolute thirty-five year old  socialite, Mike Campbell, Brett's bankrupt fiance, Robert Cohn, a writer friend of Jake's, Bill Gorton another friend of Jake's who has recently arrived in Paris.<br /><br />Hemingway has taken a simple tale, with simple language of a journey to the running of the bulls in Pamplona and formed an intricate novel involving themes of masculinity, nature, religion and honor.  Masculinity is always in the background of The Sun Also Rises.  Jake and Bill rollick on the top of the bus drinking wine from bota bags held at an arms length with the Spanish laborers.  Brett , the temptress, the siren plays the counterpoint to masculinity.  All of the men are drawn to her even the nineteen year old Spanish bullfighter, Romero.<br /><br />As we learn the steers of Pamplona manage the bulls, it is the nature of things.  We note the beautiful Spanish countryside, the changes that the travelers pass through on their journey south through Spain to Pamplona.  We experience the cold water of the Itara river as Jake and Bill fish for trout.  Nature is always an essential part of the novel and contrasted with the bars and bottegas where wine and liquor flow freely.<br /><br />One can't read The Sun Also Rises without some thought of anti-Semitism.  Every time Robert Cohn enters the picture he is described as Jewish.  The other characters constantly denigrate him, while the reader wonders what he has done to be so despised.  He went off with Lady Brett on a trip previously and hopes to reenter the relationship.  It seems this was badly presumptuous and in bad form.<br /><br />There have been numerous explanations and interpretations of this.  The dismissive and portentous one, that it was commonplace of the literature of the time and so allowable.  There is a biographic one, in which The Sun Also Rises is a retelling of Hemingway's own trip to Pamplona and his loss of friendship during this time with Harold Loeb and created Cohn as a way to even the score so to speak.  There is the theory that of course, Hemingway was anti Semitic and there are countless others all of which quite frankly I do not understand.  I do know however that when reading The Sun Also Rises the reader must come to terms with this.  I'm not sure I am there yet.n the score so to speak.

B000B5MI3Q|5.0|I made a mistake. I have owned my original Seiko diving watch since 1983, using it on hundreds of deepwater dives over the years, actually using the bezel to time my decompression stops, without any problems. I stopped diving over ten years ago due to health issues, but went on a snorkeling trip to Key West recently using my watch. Little did I know that the gaskets and O ring had dried out and thus my watch started to fog up. I took it to a jeweler when I got home. He told me that when he opened the case, the mechanism just fell out and could not be fixed. I even called Seiko but they said the same thing. When I came across this watch on Amazon and the price it was being sold for, I could not pass it up. I think I only paid $130 for the same watch in 1983! Glad I made the investment - maybe this one will last a little longer!

B001UV4XIS|5.0|The movie part 1 and part 2 are great. They deliver the essence of the Deathly Hallows book fairly well.  A few alterntions dont detract from the story too much.  Such as attributing and giving the credit and line to Hermoine about using the dragon when in the book it was Harry's idea and few other minor changes.    Almost 100% of the one star ratings are regarding the ultraviolet digital copy and not about the actual movie.  So the overall three star rating for the movie is seriously skewed by the poor reviews about the digital copy and not the movie.  As with most reviews on Amazon, you have to wade thru a lot of nonsense reviews to get to a few valid serious reviews about products.
055371452X|4.0|This is the fourth book in the Outlander series and Claire and Jamie's new adventures are in the Americas. They travel with Ian Murray (Jamie's nephew) to North Carolina where they meet Jamie's Aunt Jocasta at River Run. Even though Aunt Jocasta wants to leave Jamie her estate, he prefers to settle at Fraser's Ridge which it is more secluded and something he can call his own . Of course, Claire and Jamie run into Indians and bears on the way and meet interesting characters as well.  In addition to Claire and Jamie's story, Brianna (Claire and Jamie's daughter) and Roger Wakefield MacKenzie(distant ancestor of Dougal MacKenzie and Gille Duncan) join the adventures by doing some time travel themselves. Brianna goes back on her own from the 1970's to the 1770's to warn Claire and Jamie about a historical fact she finds out and Roger finds out and follows her.  I didn't give this book 5 stars because I thought the whole Jamie/Roger misunderstanding and the search for him took too long. However, that won't stop me from continuing on to the next in the series, The Fiery Cross.

It might even be his best work ever which is absolutely amazing considering what he has previously written, i.e., the Dark Tower series, The Stand, It, The Shining, etc.  Anyway, this is not a horror story.  I will call it a love story because it made me appreciate my life more along with the time and love that I share with my wife and 2-year-old son.  You cannot time travel, but this book will make you want to anyway.  However, I now appreciate the present even more than I already have with increased age and wisdom after reading this book.

0002051850|1.0|Someone has to say it, the supposed emperor has no clothes.  hemingway was known to be a legend in his own mind and apparently attracted a cult following.  for me, this book was a terrible disappointment; i feel cheated by the author's reputation, which seems undeserved. it's sad if the arbiters of quality in American literature view Hemingway as some kind of icon.  i voraciously read more books than i can ever count, starting out as a literature major in college and now it's 40 years later.  for whom the bell tolls is mind numbing for the most part with a plot that barely moves, does not stimulate the imagination, and makes a rather ordinary point overall. the dialog is mostly rather odd, shallow and unrevealing.  Except for the character of Pilar, who vividly and viscerally recounts instances of the brutality of man against man (and woman and animal, especially during con flict, the other characters are not well developed.  I cannot recommend this book at all.

I was very curious to find out who it was and was surprised when I found out it was Yanni - I was married at 33, have heard of Yanni before, but never in my dreams did I know his music was this powerful - physically and emotionally.   I listen to his music when I work out or relax; whether it is the powerful keyboards, mellow piano's, or the orchestra as a whole, I am forever a Yanni fan and glad I discovered his music at some point in my life.  Anyhow, I am still pricing my first blu-ray player and waiting for the WI-FI built in and 3D to be under $100 (should be real soon) and my first blu-ray concert will probably be the Yanni concert from 1995...  Good to see there are others that continue to reflect there opinions on Yanni - his music will never be out-of-date for all those thinking this is not for them...my recommendation for anyone thinking of what Yanni sounds like, listen to a few songs, not just one, close your eyes and let the music take you.

B005J7K950|5.0|When this film first appeared in 1984 there were howls of protest from practically everyone in the film community especially those who were silent film aficionados. The idea of combining contemporary pop music with a silent film classic was sacrilege. Once the furor died down and the film became available on VHS, it developed quite a cult following but then the video disappeared. After over 20 years of waiting, it has finally appeared on Blu-Ray and DVD and it has been worth the wait. This version, while not Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, is still worthy of being seen because of how well it's been put together. The color tints used for the film are beautiful and effective (Lang's original has no tints) and the editing of the film, paring it down to 87 minutes from over 2 hours of material, is quite masterful (instead of title cards there are subtitles which eliminates a lot of time). Some of the performers that Giorgio Moroder selected as musical accompaniment are quite appropriate especially Cycle V, Jon Anderson, Freddie Mercury, and Loverboy. Pat Benatar's HERE'S MY HEART (reminiscent of TITANIC's MY HEART WILL GO ON although it predates it by more than a decade) is a bit much as are some of Moroder's synthesized realizations but they do not detract from the overall impact the film makes.<br /><br />METROPOLIS' editing was always edgy to begin with which makes it an ideal candidate to be treated like a music video. Check out the famous robot creation scene or the son's hallucinations and you'll see what I mean. Adding contemporary music to silent films is nothing new these days and Moroder deserves credit for being a pioneer by helping to bring a celebrated silent film to the big screen and to the attention of younger viewers almost 30 years ago. Now METROPOLIS is back for a limited release in theaters thanks to Kino Classics complete with a Moroder supervised restoration of the soundtrack (which now has nostalgia value) in conjunction with its first release on home video in the digital medium. See it in a theater if you can but if not, then snap up this release as it too could disappear for another 25 years. Again it's not Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS (which now exists in a complete original version also from Kino), it's Giorgio Moroder's METROPOLIS and it's beautiful to look at and to listen to. It clearly shows how silent cinema is an art form unto itself and how, like other great art forms, it can be reinterpreted for future generations. This release comes with a wonderful short documentary THE FADING IMAGE which illustrates how the film was restored and then scored by Moroder.deo in the digital medium.

0439023491|5.0|For teens and adults alike, this series is a must for all. A great thrill read, and despite the nature of the material, not overly graphic in violence or sexuality.  Reading this series brought back memories of how great reading a well-written novel was. In this 2nd book, the focus is on the immediate aftermath of the Hunger Games.
0802473156|1.0|The concept of 5 love languages and humans only predominantly possessing 1 of these languages is clearly obsolete. Love itself is a universal language invented, established, and demonstrated by Jehovah God himself. This book does not mention the innovator of the subject, thus making this book non-Christian based, thus making it ineffectual for my life. If I wanted to know how to build a motor, I'd ask Henry Ford. It just makes since. God is the answer.   Oh and by the way it does not take two years for true love to take form as mentioned in chapter 3. Please browse this book in a bookstore before purchasing, I beseech you.

B005SV9X22|3.0|So I've been to plenty of Gaga shows since The Fame era, before she actually became huge.  This was an extremely entertaining show and shows Gaga can command a stage for sure.  The setlist was great, no complaints there.  My biggest problem with this show is all the yelling. There is so much yelling from her part I felt like I was in church being preached to!  Overall loved the show and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of pop music.
B001EIOOV8|3.0|The storyline to Casino is well written and very entertaining, but thought the graphic violence, blood and language was just too much. Especially the ending scene with Pesci, I mean there are other similar movies like this I have enjoyed but for some reason thought it went too far here.  This is by no means a family movie or one for kids.  If you like mystery/crime movies then think you will enjoy it and even though it's a very long film, should keep your attention well from beginning to end but if you don't like a lot graphic violent blood scenes like ones from horror films, then you might want to skip it.<br /><br />Peter J.

B005PTQPU0|5.0|After more than 30 years of writing and recording music unlike anything anyone else produces, Kate Bush, a serious artist disguised as an almost accidental pop star, is as well-known for her musical eccentricities as for her imaginative lyrics, stunning vocals, and lush aural landscapes, and there is no doubt that \\"50 Words for Snow\\" could only have been conceived and created by Kate Bush. From the first moments of its quiet opening piano chords and choir-boy vocal performed by her son, Bertie, she takes us on a journey deep into the heart of Winter in a series of seven songs, each of which revels in the contemplative and introspective, rather as if we're sitting with her by a fire while she sits at her piano musing on the nature of love, life, language, and the album's central theme, snow. It's an incredibly intimate experience, listening to the first three tracks: \\"Snowflake,\\" in which Bertie sings the role of a falling snowflake which Bush encourages to 'keep falling, I'll find you' as she repeats the sad refrain, 'The world is so loud'; \\"Lake Tahoe,\\" in which she and and counter-tenor Stefan Roberts tell the story of a Victorian woman's ghost who keeps appearing to wander around the cold lake, calling to her lost dog; and, perhaps strangest and most intriguing of all, \\"Misty\\", an unabashedly sensual song about a snowman who comes to life and makes love to the narrator, leaving her alone in soaked sheets and covered with bits of dead leaves in the morning. This triptych is built around Bush's simple vocals, jazzy piano, Steve Gadd's quiet but precise drumming, and bassist Danny Thompson's lovely bass lines, becoming denser and more complex as the songs progress.  It's almost impossible to tell when one song ends and the next begins, even though Bush has said this album is not meant to be understood as a single piece of music &agrave; la Disc 2 of \\"Aerial: A Sky of Honey.\\" But it feels as though it should be--it's hard to imagine pulling out one track and listening to it mixed in with other songs by other artists, or even by Bush herself.<br /><br />The mood shifts a bit with the fourth track, \\"Wild Man\\", the only single from the album. On this song guest star Andy Fairweather Low joins her in the rousing chorus of a tale of a group who, while trekking through the Himalayas, come upon evidence of the elusive Yeti, the 'Wild Man' of the title, and join the local lamas and sherpas to erase all tracks so as to protect it from discovery (like all Kate Bush albums, this one is a collection of unusual stories and characters--she has never been an autobiographer, but almost a short story writer). Track five has generated the most mixed reviews so far, as she and Elton John trade vocals as lovers forever separated by events that span time (from the burning of Rome to 9/11 in New York City) on \\"Snowed in on Wheeler Street\\"; his performance here is a bit too muscular to sit quite comfortably beside her more delicate one, but his voice is strong and emotional, and they are convincing as an eternally star-crossed couple. Actor Stephen Fry guests on the title track, reciting Bush's fanciful list of \\"50 Words for Snow\\" in the guise of a language professor, cunningly named Joseph Yupik, the name of a Siberian-dwelling people, against a backdrop of rather agitated guitar-centered music. It is the least interesting song on the album, but again, if one listens to the entire hour-long record as one piece of music, it fits in well enough, and certainly opens a window onto her sense of humor (she made up many of the words--\\"spangladasha,\\" \\"swans-a-melting,\\" \\"stellatundra,\\" and even includes one in Klingon). She closes the album with the simple piano ballad, \\"Among Angels,\\" the only song not directly to do with Winter or snow, but which calls to mind falling back and making snow angels, and takes us out of the album with the same quiet with which it opened.<br /><br />At 53 years old her voice has aged into a mellow, much lower register which sheuses to great advantage, both singing and performing spoken word sections in some of the songs. But where her age shows most clearly is in the album's quiet authority. For all its extravagant imaginings (some would say \\"silly,\\" an adjective I suspect she'd be fine with), she evinces no doubt at all about the strength of the album. 2005's \\"Aerial\\" was a no-holds-barred foray into the glory of nature on a Summer's day in the sunshine and then a night swimming under a starry sky, and it's narrative and musical thrust took us outdoors to enjoy birdsong, laughter, the ocean--the intense joy of being alive in the natural world. \\"50 Words for Snow\\" is that album's counterpoint, shutting us inside on a cold day to roam through a fantastical, but beautiful, interior world in a wistful, rather than joyous frame of mind. The album is long (just over an hour) and requires that one slow down and listen; there are no catchy hooks or pop-chart climbers, but what's on offer instead is a break from chaos and a noisy, intrusive world. Writing about \\"Aerial\\" one critic said that no other recording artist allows us such unfettered access to her imagination, and true to form, Kate has again issued an invitation to join her her in that unique place. Settle in, turn the stereo up loud, and enjoy.<br /><br />(For those who find similarities in this review to the album's Wikipedia article, this isn't a copy and paste job: I wrote most of that article.

1451648537|5.0|I have to admit, the last computer from Apple that I owned was an Apple IIgs and I was reluctant to buy an iPhone and and early iPod. I'm a PC user. However, the \\"aura\\" of Steve Jobs has always fascinated me. This book is no exception.<br /><br />At just under 600 pages I figured that I had a LONG read ahead of me. I finished it in five days because I couldn't put it down. The writing by Isaacson is superb and the fact that Jobs, for once in his short life, let someone else be in charge of the project without his final and ongoing approval is amazing.<br /><br />However, I was totally fascinated by this visionary and a man obsessed by perfection. A man who was [probably] worth billions, yet lived a very simple life. If you ever get to meet a visionary in your lifetime, you know you've met someone special. I've met one and he has always fascinated me. Jobs, on the other hand, was 50% visionary 50% taskmaster 50% perfectionist and 50% designer. He was 200% - two men.<br /><br />I have a greater appreciation for what he did for Apple for all of those years and now understand why iMac, iPhone, ipad, iEtc, fans are why they are. Isaacson really makes you feel that you know the man and the quirks that drove him and the demons that also drove him. I have recommended this book to everyone whom I have spoken to since I finished reading it.<br /><br />My big question will remain, will Apple survive without him? He saw his product like no one else and would never settle for anything less than 110% perfection - and then improve on that. I hope there is someone there who can take his visions and make them into future products beyond the next generation iPhone and iPad....and that Apple doesn't become \\"just another company\\"<br /><br />Thank you to Mr. Isaacson for bringing us into the mindset of a great, albeit somewhat crazy, man - who demanded AND GOT what he needed to make his perfect products
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just finished The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.  It's the first book that I've read by her, but I look forward to more.  The characters were instantly real, the backdrop was dark and well thought out, and the plot (while very dark) was totally believable.  A great book without question.  Don't hesitate to pick this one up.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Dispense first with the easiest criticism of The Night Circus - whenever the author has written herself into a tight spot, it is (literally) magically resolved. A wrinkle of Samantha's nose, a shake of Jeannie's hips... plotting is always a bit easier when when your main characters can bend reality with a wish.  That being said, Erin Morgenstern has created a dazzling and heavily stylized vision that crackles with energy. Her magical circus hums with sharp silver energy, like a portrait painted in mercury. The characters and even the plot are really just tools to explore this wondrous place, and every new description brings a new delight. If the two central characters sometimes feel flat, the supporting cast more than compensates: a rakish Indian producer of spectacles, a reverent German clockmaker, a wistful tarot reader, an enigmatic contortionist.   Most of the narrative is traditionally linear, but a recurring sequence set at the other end of the timeline keeps the entire story pulling- sometimes leisurely, sometimes frantically - toward a powerful center of gravity.   All told, the vision is unique and the story is compelling, and while that might not qualify it for great literature, it certainly classifies it as a great read.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|After I saw some of the initial reviews of this product I was worried that what I was about to receive was going to not be very good.  I was happy to be proven wrong.  It is a great case.  It also doesn't seem cheap at all to me.  The plastic is a polycarbonate material that is extremely hard, yet thin.  It also has a nice grippy feel to it as well.  It seems very sturdy when the Fire is placed in it.    The stand works extremely well when on a hard surface.  However, I have found another way to make the stand more sturdy on any surface. Simply stretch the elastic strap over the bottom of the stand.  Just a little warning, it does stretch out the elastic a little bit, but it still secures the front cover just fine when you have the flap closed again.  Just thought I'd share.  I'd definitely recommend this case.  I will try and post a picture on the product main page of how I secured the stand with the elastic strap.

B005VM9DGO|5.0|The tracks conveyed something that is truly universal. The \\"Song for a New Beginning\\" made me believe that anyone can relive his/her disconsolate moments like losing the beloved, having to travel away, or failing to meet everlasting goals... as long as you did live through those stories.  Things didn't stop there in the sorrow. You can always find the percussion or high-pitch notes that lead you to an uplifting status. That's the best part I always loved in Secret Garden. I found it never a hard thing to see through the \\"hope\\" hand in hand with the Irish melancholy. For this I thank the musicians, consciously or not they fulfilled what life stories gave us -- to pave the road underneath us so we can stand, walk, or even dance without any misgivings.   - C.

1400069181|5.0|Since I own my own business, I was excited to read Mycoskie's new book. Frankly reading business books is like having teeth pulled. But this was fun, he introduces you to companies that have tried and succeeded at this business model. You learn how much risk there is in getting into a new business and how to make friends in the industry. I realized how small TOMS was in the beginning and how frugality can make a company succeed! I love how Mycoskie talks about his \\"office\\" on Hollywood blvd and how he uses business cards...and his 1st phone call from Nordstroms. There is so much to learn and take away from this book.<br /><br />As a business newbie, this gives me a great starting point for my business. And as a business that wants to help a larger cause I can see that there is a way of doing this and still being profitable!!<br /><br />If you are interested in Starting Something that Matters...I suggest you read this book. Whether it's a non-profit here in the US or a for profit that helps locally. What matters is you learn how to do it and be successful.

B002SJIO4A|4.0|This was actually a pretty good movie. It starts off really slow, and is kinda boring for the first 15-20 mins. I was about to turn it off. But I'm glad I kept watching because it turned out to be a good movie. I found myself getting attached to the main character, and also the main alien and the little alien boy (or girl? I never got that). It was very fun to watch.  I was cheering for them at the end, while they were trying to escape Earth. Some of the parts of this movie are a little unrealistic, but other parts I could actually see happening. If aliens ever did come to Earth, we would probably treat them in a similar way as they were treated in the movie. Unless they were so advanced and aggressive they just whiped us out from orbit.  I don't want go to into much detail about the movie, because I don't want to give too much away. But it was a really good movie. It was a lot better than I had expected. It had a completely different focus than move alien movies. It is played in more of a historical format... It's played like this is something that had happened on Earth in the past, and this was just a recount of what happened. Kind of like a documentary/movie rolled into one package. This time we are the attackers on the aliens, instead of the aliens coming to kill us.... (that was a nice change up). The graphics/animations also weren't that bad! They were much better than I had pictured.  And... I sure hope he comes back in 3 years! I can't wait to see District 10!! (if you've seen the movie you will understand what I mean)

Every film of the saga was exciting, magical and somehow emotional, but this one... the last one, was the best one.<br />I just can't believe Harry Potter ended! The ending was magical, emotional and just really good. I don't even have words to express how I feel about the end of this era, but finally my Harry Potter collection is complete! The saga should be remembered by a lot of people, because even if it ended, everyone knows about the films, and a lot of people knows how I feel too.<br /><br />And by the way, please stop giving the DVD a bad rating just because of the Ultraviolet copy! The movie is the thing that matters!
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I'm not sure what the bad reviews are about, but I really love this CD!  I didn't love it at first listen, but I never do with any CD.  Very flowing, catchy, and sticks in your head (in a good way).  I'm a newer Coldplay CD (Viva la Vida was the 1st CD I own by them) but I like this one better than Vida.  Yes, the Rhianna song is surprising at first, but it's ok and I don't skip it.  I only skip #8 because the music just sounds too dark for me.
B003Y5H574|5.0|I gotta admit that the main reason I wanted to see this movie is because I love Steve Carell, Emma Stone and even Ryan Gosling. But I got a different view of love, not as your typical romantic comedy style one, it is very well-written, the actors are really good, and even the end with a twist keeps being great.<br />The plot works great, the jokes are funny, and it feels like the film found its way to be charming, and very rememberable. I think I could watch it everyday and never get bored.<br /><br />If you're looking for a romantic comedy, pick \\"Crazy, Stupid Love.\\", you won't regret. You'll have a good time.
B0054S6N04|5.0|One of the best book I ever read. I'm definitely Ms Howard's fan. This book has everything romance, comedy, drama and suspense what else can you asked for. If I can give 10 star I will.
0671646788|5.0|I have seen this book praised by a few other authors and it ended up on my Wish List.  They call this book a business classic for a reason.  There are many books out there that were inspired by the basic ideas in this book as well as a lot of great business ideas.  This book does have some outdated references, however the ideas in this book are as timeless as the idea of business itself.<br /><br />If you're looking for a new direction of successful thinking, get this book and use it to your advantage.
B002CGSYNU|1.0|Do not know what camera this company is looking at but this lens does not fix, about 1/2 the size of the lens I am thought I ordered. Sold the lens I bought at my yardsale because shipping it back cost more than its worth!
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Despite I agree that it is a good app, and the price may be reasonable,   but it does not meet my need so far since I want to see the equation in Office 2010 file.  That is, I cannot see any equation in the documents (like .docx), unless I make it into .doc.  You know, it is more inconvenient to me. Hope the company can improve this problem soon.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This organizer is excellent on the Baby Jogger City Select! Cup holder is a great size for multiple size cups, including standard to-go coffee. zipper pouch is good for small items like pacifiers. plenty of room in the main open area for cell phone, burp cloth, toy. It does not all zip closed so items will fall out if folding stroller. I really don't fold stroller all that much so this works great for me!
1441851917|4.0|I love the story, but somehow it felt like it was missing something more after I read \\"Love in the Afternoon.\\"  I still adore it though. Wish there was more of Evie and Sebastian.  The audiobook version read by vanessa maroney was fantastic. She made Evie stuttering voice so adorable. No wondering Sebastian fell in love with her.   I didn't however like Rosalyn Landor's version of evie. Rosalyn Landor stuttering was annoying to me. Wish I could like edit the  male voice in Rosalyn Landor version and the Evie's stuttering voice from vanessa maroney and make it into one.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Every since I started reading Mark Cuban's weblog, BlogMaverick.com, I've been emailing links of my favorite posts to my employees and business associates. I subscribe to it on my RSS feed and typically read every entry within a matter of hours. So when I saw Mark's entry on Facebook that he had produced an ebook for sale, I bought it without a second thought. I must admit, I read the foreword and was immediately irritated to learn that the ebook was simply a collection of his most popular posts, many of which I'd read 10x over. Oh well, it's $2.99 as I read his first post which he discusses his humble beginnings coming to Dallas as a broke college grad. 5 hours later, I'm finished with the book and I'm convinced that was probably the best $3 I've spent on a book. If you're a blogmaverick reader his old posts have been updated with details and commentary that you will find very interesting and if you're not a blog maverick reader, you will no do doubt find find inspiration and more importantly, practical advice that applies to any business.   What I have always found most impressive about Mark is how little he cares about what people think about and how passionate he is about getting 'IT' right. This book arranges his rags to riches tale in a chronological order that will be of great practical use to any entrepreneur.   One thing I've felt throughout this NBA Lockout and ever more so after reading this ebook is that Mark Cuban must be going absolutely insane sitting in these 'business meetings' over the NBA's labor issues with dinosaurs like Billy Hunter and David Stern. I'll borrow a quote from his post \\"Twelve Cuban Mantra for Success\\":  \\"11. Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered   This is one I got from my partner Todd Wagner. He is right on. Sometimes you have to go for the jugular, but more often than not, the biggest mistake people make is getting too greedy.    Every good deal has a win-win solution. There is nothing I hate more than someone who tries to squeezevery last penny out of a deal. Who often raises the aggravation level to the point where it's not worth doing the deal. Which also raises the dislike level to the point where even if a deal gets done, you look for ways to never do business with that person or company again.   Business happens over years and years. Value is measured in the total upside of a business relationship, not by how much you squeezed out in any one deal.\\"  hrrmm...wonder if this could apply to Dan Gilbert and MJ??  Well as I digress, I'll end this review with saying that rather than emailing links to my employees, friends and business associates, I'm going to buy this ebook for them.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book. Well worth the price and it was an addicting read. The emotions and drama pulled you right in.
B0057UAE54|5.0|I purchased a copy of this CD because I had gotten tickets to the 'Comes Alive' Anniversary Concert.  I hadn't heard it in soooo many years and it brought back the memories of the great tunes and his guitar skills that we took for granted back then.  What an amazing man/artist!  Thanks Peter.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book captivated me from the very start.  Its not the type of book I normally read.  But on the recomendation of a close friend I took the plunge and boy and I glad I did. I started and finished the book in a weekend.  Came back to her and begged her for the next one.  All in all I am ready to read the third one...I can't stop thinking of Katniss and Petta and Gale....I want more.  I hope Suzanne Collins continues the Saga.  Now I hear there is a movie to be released in March of  2012. I simply can't wait...
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I had this app on my HTC Evo 4G and I just downloaded it to my Fire. I was able to sync my notes from my Evo to my Fire without having to re-type everything. I can sync to all my devices! I love that! I have never had a problem with losing notes after an update. Now they are backed up with my Google account, so I will always have them.
B0050QV0RQ|1.0|Great game, but after 7 hours of playtime my saved files mysteriously disappeared. I am not sure if this is a common issue but I will never trust this game again.
B004VBAHG6|5.0|Ninth is awesome!  Peter Murphy's best album since Cascade (which is still my favorite) and right up there with his classic Deep.  There are so many songs on this album that have taken hold of me and I keep playing.  I had almost given up on any new Murphy releases after Dust which I'm sure has many musical merits, but which was over-my-head.  I could not get into any of the songs save for the \\"Subway (Epilogue)\\" only because it was my favorite song off Cascade.  I'd listen to a song and have no clue how it went once it ended and I lost interest in Murphy's new material by the time Unshattered came out.  Such is definitely not the case with Ninth which sports so many memorable and catchy songs.  I went to a Murphy concert in March 2011, three months before the release of Ninth, and he played several numbers from the new album (\\"Memory Go\\" being one of them) and I knew right away that this marked a return to the Peter Murphy music that made me such a fan.  Ninth did not disappoint.  \\"Velocity Bird\\" is an excellent beginning track as it is full of energy and rocks.  \\"Seesaw Sway\\" is the second single off the album. I really like the guitar work during the verses.  \\"Peace To Each\\" reminds me of \\"The Light Pours Out Of Me\\" off Should The World Fail To Fall Apart.  Despite the title, this track is very hard and heavy.  \\"I Spit Roses\\" was the first single off Ninth.  It is a very catchy song but the first line is just grammatically strange: \\"The captain is sea.\\"  I like songs with nautical themes.  \\"Never Fall Out\\" is a relaxing, kick back number: \\"If you fall in love with me, you'll never fall out\\" (ha, ha).    \\"Memory Go\\" never left my memory after I saw Murphy perform it live in March 2011.  It is the type of song that sticks in one's head, and it rocks.  My favorite song off this album is \\"The Prince & Old Lady Shade.\\"  It was released with \\"I Spit Roses\\" as the first single.  The instrumentation is wonderful and the violin at the beginning and end gives it beauty.  Isaw a video where Peter Murphy, guitarist Mark Thwaite, and a violinist played the song on the street, and it was terrific.  \\"Uneven & Brittle\\" is a grinding rocker.  \\"Slowdown\\" reminds me of something with the beginning bass rift and the guitar during the verses, I just can't put my finger on it and it drives me nuts.  \\"Secret Silk Society\\" is quiet, dark, and mysterious.  \\"Crème de la Crème\\" is an older song that Murphy played on the Dust tour that finally emerges here.  The piano, orchestration, and build-up in intensity at the end makes it an excellent conclusion to Ninth.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I, like many others, have used D2G since the Palm days and haven't been disappointed with this version. Thanks to the FAOTD program here on Amazon, I own most all of the office applications for Android, and this is the best one.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|From the opening line of \\"I was born in a cloud\\" the 9-minute opening track that evokes the quietness of remembrances of walks through a virgin snowfall where Kate is pleading for someone to catch her as she is falling, falling, falling....like a snowflake in slow motion swirl to earth to her screaming \\"Let me hear your 50 words for snow\\" like she is in a sexual ecstasy on the tribal sounding title track. It's a \\"must own\\" for Kate Bush fans and lovers of experimental music. Her voice is fragile, powerful, beautiful, unreal, grounded, floating, erotic and many other adjectives all at once. The track list, while small, offers up long compositions...the shortest being 7 minutes. Nothing \\"radio-friendly\\", either...which I couldn't care less about.<br /><br />I got to hear it several times before it went on sale thanks to NPR's \\"first listen\\" and it is so beautiful and it is very compelling and her voice does not sound like tires screeching on a wet road (that is a good thing for this listener) as it has sometimes in the past and the stark use of drums and violins support her breathy, etherial voice, making this record true art. There is no \\"single\\" off this record and you can't dance to it. It's the type of art that you want to savor in one 67 minute sitting with the beverage of your choice and if snow happens to be falling outside of your window as you cozy up to this recording and maybe your fireplace, then all the better for you. Her piano playing has a light touch as well and it weaves in and out instead of being a main instrument.<br /><br />Snow has it's jazzy moments, it's rocking moments but mostly it is a quiet, fluid record that demands that you listen with an open heart. I think it's probably the best work she has ever done as an album as a whole (although it has nothing as powerful as Wuthering Heights or anything that will make you immediately cry like The Man with the Child in his Eyes) this is one record that is a whole work and not really just a collection of unrelated songs. All songs evoke memories of winter weather even to the point of \\"Wild Man\\" where she is accusing this person of leaving footprints in the snow as a way of finding the unfindable. Or trying to define the undefinable.<br /><br />You know you want it... How many years have you been waiting, hoping for a new release from Kate? Give it to yourself as an early Christmas gift. This record does not disappoint, unless you are looking for something extremely powerful in a loud way. And if you are new to Kate Bush and love electronica melded with piano and strings with a lovely voice guiding the sound, buy it. OH! And Sir Elton John makes an appearance on this record and it's a great kind of unusual duet and the most rocking track on \\"Snowed in at Wheeler Street\\" where Kate suggests that she get a rope and ties them together because they have lost each other so much but have caught glimpses of each other all over the world before this final confrontation.<br /><br />The most \\"typical\\" KB sounding song to me is the final track \\"Angels\\" so if you can only afford to download one song, this is the one you want.ngs.

B0055B0MIO|5.0|This album is a must buy for all metal fans. The album is heavier than any other Trivium album, I cannot fault this album in any way. The heavy riffs and melodies are additive and extremely creative, this album will impress, especially how heavy the sound is through the entire album. I cannot understand any negative reviews for this album, I think those who wrote a negative review should listen to the album again and really give it a chance with no ego.  This album is my favourite for the year, I love this album, it is a classic.

Although I gained a comprehensive insight into the life and times of Steve after reading the biography I'm asking myself myself who is the real Steve Jobs.The book could have been better edited, too much repetition of steve's  'reality distortion' complex. In sum not a bad read. [[ASIN:1451648537 Steve Jobs]]

B005DOKIYG|2.0|I purchased this case thinking it was a good bargain for helping to keep my new Kindle Fire safe.  As others have stated, it does come with a strong chemical odor.  The inside was small bubble wrap type of protection.  I could not see this keeping my Kindle safe beyond minimal problem.  This is something you would expect from a dollar discount store and is way overpriced. I think $10 would be a more reasonable price for the item.  I returned mine and bought the leather Marware cover instead.  Although it is almost double the price of the sleeve, it is of much better quality and you definitely feel it offers more protection. After your investment on the Kindle Fire, I'd follow through with another small investment for the Marware cover instead.
B005POK858|4.0|I found myself wanting to know what would happen next with this game.  The fights were easy, but not boring.  I spent a little over 9 hours playing, and I enjoyed it.  That said, this game has a flaw: you can't quit the application properly. It uses 100% cpu in the background when you switch away.  And you must save your game before switching apps (like checking email) or you will have to use the auto-save.  Exiting the title screen via the &quot;quit&quot; button just restarts the app for me.  Keeping all that in mind, I was still able to complete the game without a problem.
0307887960|5.0|I bought the book in August- started the diet on Labor day. So far, 20 pounds gone, and I am continuing to loose steadily. I did cheat a few times- there were 2 birthdays, a wedding and a funeral, plus a weekend of \\"no dieting\\".But it was easy to get back on track. Iam 49 and have tried EVERY diet in the past- Jenny Craig, Nutra System, LA weightloss, Atkins, Weight Wachers.Each time I lost less and gained more. Dukan diet is easy to follow, and the results are evident. I highly recommend this book.
B005N95JA4|5.0|I'm really not sure how to grade this new Deluxe set.  There's no way in the world I could ever give The Rolling Stones \\"Some Girls\\" anything less than 5 stars, but grading it as a deluxe package I'm not sure it is 5 stars.  12 bonus tracks from sessions that actually resulted in at least twice that many is a bit disappointing, but I have to say what they have included is great.  \\"Claudine\\", \\"We Had It All\\" and \\"No Spare Parts\\" are all welcome additions to the official catalog.  I can't understand however, the logic in not including great b-sides from this era like \\"Everything is Turning to Gold\\" and 12\\" mixes of \\"Miss You\\" etc..  The bonus disc is only 40 minutes long - there certainly was room!

B0053FP1PQ|3.0|Brit pop has really...well not progressed all that much in the last half-decade.  This band was destined to be the best of these bands but a sweet tooth production has this band sounding like the Monkeys (but not the Arctic ones...)from years past.  If this is the best collection of songs this band has in their studio then well, their audience of teen chicks will be there for awhile and then go to college.  This is a lazy uninspired effort of washed out pop tunes that barely grab you.  It's truly amazing how many of these Brit bands take themselves so seriously on their 3rd albums that they all sound so self-consciously bad.  The Kooks have better in them.
B00466HN86|5.0|We saw it in theaters in Costa Rica, and I bless Kendrick Brothers, Sherwood Baptist Church and any other person involved in this amazing film. The best movie ever, along with Fireproof. Heart-touching, it compels you to be totally different as soon as the credits show up on screen at the end of it. You wonder: \\"What have I been doing before this movie? I've got to make quite serious changes!\\"
1451627289|3.0|It would have been better had it been 500 pages shorter (or better yet, a novella) and if he had left out the Kennedy part and called it 09/09/58. The intertwined love story was far more interesting than the tedious Kennedy plot. I now remember why I stopped reading SK in the late 80's and won't be so quick to buy his next. The 3 stars are for Sadie.

1419702238|5.0|Bought this book at a diffedrent retailer only because my son couldn't wait to get. He is 9. He read the book cover to cover within approx 3hrs. Would not stop till he finished. He loved it and I loved that he enjoyed it so!
B0065IBZI2|4.0|The first four tracks of this album are really something special. But the last three slow things down - a lot.  Snowed in at Wheeler Street, with Elton John, is just cheesy. Whereas 50 words for snow with Stephen Fry is hard to get through.  I think you have to give this album 4 out of 5 stars. The good stuff is good indeed and the bad is just not that great. I recommend it, with reservations.
1451627289|4.0|Having read just about every book on JFK's life and times and his assassination, I was instantly drawn to this fiction novel due to the subject matter. I had tried to read Stephen King in the past and never really cared for his work, but wow, was I surprised that I couldn't put this novel down after starting it!!!! It was a page turner, kept me guessing and very gripping.  I would caution you though, to remember (duh) that this is a work of fiction. While I read King's afterward explaining his thoughts on who assassinated JFK, I rolled my eyes. Even a layman who has completed rudimentary research on this subject knows more than King shows he knows. The books he mentioned that he read on the subject were all the WRONG books - hello! He seemed to mention and have read only materials that merely backed up the one conclusion that he came to.   Anyway, if you can get past his single minded thought process on the real crime and remember this is a fun book, you'll love it. Just don't listen to King's theory on who killed JFK. It defies intelligence and rational thinking. If you want to know about the assassination, (for real) I recommend you read \\"Bloody Treason: The Assassination of John F. Kennedy\\", \\"Someone Would Have Talked: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the Conspiracy to Mislead History\\", or \\"JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died & Why It Matters\\". Then you will have the full, REAL picture of why he died and who did it.

0439023521|5.0|I started reading this with my 10-year old daughter.  She was finished after 2 days, it took me longer since I had to make dinner but I would definately say it's a page-turner that you can't put down.  I think I sustained a neck injury from being in one position too long.  I originally started reading it since I wanted to make sure it was appropriate for a 5th grader, and it was okay. There are violent scenes where folks are getting killed but nothing too over the top.  The book reminded me of The Long Walk by Stephen King that I read when I was in high school.  If you liked that book than I definately think you'll like this one.  Both are set in a future time where teenagers participate in a \\"game\\" where the sole survivor wins.  Along the way alliances are formed and newly formed friendships are \\"lost\\".  As in the case of The Long Walk, the winner of the Hunger Games will be rewarded with fame, fortune and life, but at what cost.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|It looks and feels like a leather bound book. I wanted a cover that was slim and looked nice. So many covers are just plain boring. There is a pocket inside the front cover but I am not sure I will even use it. I have a Kensington pen stylus that I put on the inside binding and the cover closes just fine. At first the cover was stiff and would not close all the way (even without the stylus) but with a little use it softens up just fine. The straps that hold the Kindle in place are very snug and very secure. The only thing is that they go over the speakers so it muffles the sound a little bit. I have no problem with this as I use ear buds. Overall it is a great cover. Yes it takes a bit to put it on your Kindle but the end result is worth it!

0307593312|3.0|I am a huge fan of Murakami, and read several of his books, so of course as soon as he publishes a new one, I am looking for it.  Actually, I had a friend buy 1Q84 for me abroad, since it took some weeks to be available in my country (and now I am waiting for the last part, also bought for me somewhere else).  Book one got me hooked, loved the characters and couldn't wait to go from one chapter to the other to know what was in store for them.  Book 2 really disappointed me, by itself, I would have rated it with no more than 2 stars.  I know from previous books that Murakami is not easy to read, and it is very difficult to explain.  You have to take them as good literature and sometimes forgive the author some slides into the too fantastic.  But this was a bit too much for me.  I am sincerely hoping that the last chapter won't be as obnoxious as I found the second one.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|so inconsiderate to give a 15 dollar app they just got for free one star because of ridiculous reasons. if you don't like it, uninstall it, and get over it. get a life and don't waste your time just to write a bad review. its a great app depending on your needs, it was free today so you didn't loose anything, give em a good review because 99% of you, myself included couldn't make a word app 1/4 as good...
1451627289|4.0|Turn this book over.  On the back jacket is a headline that reads \\"JFK Escapes Assasination Attempt\\".  Maybe a million Boomers experience an amazing mental blip on seeing this.  For a nanosecond, their brains inform them of a fantastic revelation:  that incredible and, for some, almost unbearable horror never happened after all.  Then reality quickly reasserts itself, and one is left only to ponder.  The headline on the jacket's front reflects the brutal truth, but it isn't right either.  No newspaper would have printed \\"JFK Slain...\\"  He was President Kennedy or The President.  And the day his life was extinguished, it felt as if the universe not only warped, but rent.    For many who experienced that day, there is a bubble of time that stands still.  There can be no elucidation, no understanding, no resolution.    This bemusement embodies the most frightening aspect of life.  So much is random.  Bad things happen to good people.  Move a rock in the road, and tomorrow someone may trip on it.  It is the unknown and unknowable that most scares humanity.  And Stephen King has always been a master at exploring and exploiting this fear.  He can frighten with both the esoteric and the mundane.  In his newest novel, it is the power of a simple, ordinary man that is most fearsome.  It is the power of Lee Oswald to kill Jack Kennedy and bring Camelot crashing down in a single second.  It is the power of protagonist Jake Eppling to  rend the fabric of time and bring the world, if not the universe, collapsing into chaos.  Or, Jake may simply stop the assasination, but somehow screw up the future for every human born and to-be-born from 11/22/63 hence.    King, as always, weaves a mighty good yarn.  His characters are distinctive, well drawn, believable, and memorable.  His descriptions of Sixties America, as observed through the prism of a backward time traveler, are both insightful and intriguing.    The problems with the book are two-fold and, in a way, opposite to one another.  The first is the tendency of any writer to run away with himself for the sheer joy of writing, as King has so obviously done with this work.  When a description of a high school stage production goes so far as to detail repeated encores and pie-throwings, there should be a solid narrative reason.  It has already been established that the involved students have put on a highly successful show, that they adore teacher Jake and librarian Sadie, that these small-town Texas folk of yesteryear are easy-going and fun-loving.  So, what's the point of prolonging the storyline in this manner?  Plot-wise, it leads nowhere and, ideally, should have been edited.    The second problem--and a much lesser one--is the bald injection of socio-political viewpoints in a way that feels heavyhanded and preachy.  An example involves Jake stopping at a gas station restroom in the South.  He notes a sign indicating that the only accomodation for black people is a woodsy stream out back.  For anyone not personally familiar with Jim Crow, this scene is certainly striking and disturbing--and it's definitely realistic.  But King apparently felt it necessary to have Jake proclaim that any reader (of the character's journal) should recall this event in case he held any rosy illusions about the early Sixties.    Fortunately, these problems do not overly burden the story as a whole.  The lefty barbs are a minor ho-hum, and the instances of runaway narration are a temporary, albeit tiresome, distraction.    Some readers have expressed dislike for Jake's surveillance of the Oswald character, his family, and contacts.  This reviewer found them endlessly fascinating and wished there had been more of that and less of girlfriend Sadie.    Another common complaint from longtime fans is that King has lost his touch for penning traditional horror.  Yet, in this book, which employs several chilling allusions to previous tales, he very aptly displays his famous skill in describing a scene just outside infamous little Derry.  Alone, his protagonist comes upon a huge fallen smokestack in a desolate, primevally overgrown lot.  There is something inside the black depths of the man-high chimney.  Jake quickly departs, and neither protagonist nor reader ever know what it was.  But constant readers have their suspicions.  How about that for the next book?
1451629184|5.0|As I got into this book, every time I picked it up, even as I merely thought about picking it up again, my stomach would go into knots and I would be nauseous, but I kept on reading, because I felt I owed it to Jaycee.  She had lived through horrific circumstances for 18 years, and now she had found her voice to talk about it, and I needed to hear what she had to say.  It was beyond traumatic, yet through it all I find she was extremely strong, insightful and creative in how she helped herself get through it day after day.  The book is beautifully written and it is a tribute to her strength and courage.  Jaycee you are truly an amazing woman.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|I just seen this at the movie's with my fiance.  I gotta say , it was a really, really good movie!    The main test was my woman, who tends not to care much for the movie's I pick out. Without me saying a word to her, she just opened up on the ride home and said \\"That movie was excellent!\\" and then continued with saying \\"It really held my attention the entire time!\\", she thought Henry Cavill was just awesome in it as-well. as did I!  It was better then I thought it was gonna be, and the last 30min of the movie are just action packed with excitement!    I'm not the type to get into spoilers, so I will close this with saying if you are into action, some kick ass fighting, and a good story, this one is for you!  :)
0547258305|1.0|Per the recommendation of a friend, I picked up this book, and Fire, to possibly give my little sister for Christmas. I'm so glad I decided to read it first. If you're looking to purchase good YA fiction, keep looking. There are some aspects to this book that I think are great - loyalty, adventure, believing in yourself, etc. However, the author's anti-marriage propaganda is completely inappropriate for YA audiences. In addition to that (spoiler), the hints to the gratuity of the villain's villainy is too much (animal torture and child abuse). His \\"grace\\" didn't have to be so evil. I was stunned that this was in a YA novel. I'm returning both books now. No way am I keeping them, or recommending them. Stick to Shannon Hale's Bayern series...

0765324857|5.0|If like me you've become a fan of the Bioshock series of games, you won't want to pass up the chance to find out more about the eponymous city of Rapture and the crisis that led to the events that unfold throughout the games. It's rare for a computer game tie-in novel to capture so perfectly the creepy atmosphere and building dread that are so well presented by the actual gameplay of the original, but John Shirley acquits himself very well. The characterisation is spot-on, giving an enticing glimpse into the catastrophe that was to befall Andrew Ryan's ill-fated social experiment. As other reviewers have noted, however, it's definitely best to wait until you've played through the games at least once before you pick up the book: unavoidable though it may be, spoilers abound! A good read to accompany a great game.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I have been a Harry Potter fan since there were only 3 books.  I had heard about them and decided to try them when I found them in large paperback form at my local Walmart (since replaced with hardback).  I got the third book elsewhere (in hardback) and purchased each of the subsequent books as they were issued.<br /><br />I purchased each movie in DVD or VHS (early ones since replaced with DVD) as it came out as well.  I had not seen Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 before I received the DVD and could not turn it off!<br /><br />From the start of the movie it was almost non-stop tension and almost as much action!  You had to keep watching it.  It helped tremendously if you have read the book but it would be exciting anyway.<br /><br />There were a few differences between the book and movie but that was to be expected.  I'm glad they allowed Neville his moment of glory against Nagini.<br /><br />One odd point, though.  At the end with the group older - why did Harry's and Ginny's daughter have red hair like her and both boys have black hair like him?  Similar for Ron and Hermione.  The girl looked like her and the boy looked like him.  A bit overly stereotypical but not enough to detract from the movie.  I just wish they would have put that last comment about Neville in that section.<br /><br />Again - of all the movies, this was the most exciting and impossible to turn away from.  Extremely good movie!

B0042RUMIW|2.0|Quite frankly, I really don't understand why 3 songs from the cd are NOT included on the dvd: \\"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You\\", \\"Fields of Gold\\" and \\"Shape of My Heart\\". These are actually some of Sting's biggest solo hits. I have to be honest and say that I bought the dvd without really realising that \\"Faith\\" and \\"Fields\\" weren't part of the dvd. I was shocked when I found it out. The mid-section of the dvd goes on and on forever and some songs there could have easily been replaced by the 3 I mentioned. How come these 3 tracks are ''good enough'' to put on the cd, but not on the actual dvd? I feel completely cheated.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The only people who wouldn't like this are non-believers!

What possibly can anyone say against all that?! dl this now, you clicked for the right reasons
B003LSTK8G|4.0|This book is a great read.  It discusses a complicated subject in a short book.  I prefer \\"The Big Short\\" over \\"Too Big to Fail\\" which was weighed down by going into so much detail that did not benefit the overall purpose of the book. But I don't feel like I truly understand what exactly happened or why it happened.  Wrong incentives, bad people, dumb choices, just stupid behavior, it could be a lot of things. The last few pages in which Lewis discusses the interview with the Financial Inquiry Commission is the best part of the book and sums up the whole event and what happened.

B003INBNXO|4.0|Disclaimer: I viewed this film as a streaming rental, and as such cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the disc.  My review has to do with the entertainment value of the film only.  There's probably not a great need for another positive review of 'Ip Man', other than the opportunity to pile on the recommendations.  Still, there are a couple of points one might want to consider when deciding whether to take a chance on it or not.  First, if you are already a fan of martial art films, then this is an excellent choice.  While I don't watch a ton of them, I was very impressed with the action sequences here, coupled with the production quality.  Like many movies of this type, there is not a tremendous amount of depth to the story - down and out good guy vs. a bad guy who has all the odds in his favor, yet the good guy wins out.  That's it in a nutshell, which is the formula for a lot of genre pictures, whether martial arts or American westerns.  But if you don't demand that every film you watch plumb the depths of the human condition, and are looking for a simple action film, then this one does it extremely well.  Ip Man was a genuine historical figure, and his particular variation of Kung Fu was called Wing Chun - and among his students was a young Bruce Lee.  This made me wonder how much of the rest of this story was true-to-life, though the only help that Wikipedia gives is that \\"the film takes a number of liberties with Yip's life, often for dramatic effect\\".  Now you know as much as I do - probably best to take most of the sequences as the process of mythologizing a folk hero.  Not that there's anything wrong with that!  One last note: The service I streamed this rental from had the original Cantonese and Japanese audio.  From a few of the other reviewers, it seems as if Amazon only offers this in a dubbed version.  Depending on how important the audio is to you may make Amazon's version best, or not.  The service I streamed from starts with an N and ends with an etflix.
B00415ZW58|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this dvd! Loved it sooo muuuuch :D I recommend to all. It was in excellent condition, brand new packaging to be exact, and I had no problem viewing it. I suggest watching it in Mandarin instead of Cantonese because the Mandarin version is the actual voice of the actors. If anything happened to my dvd I would come back to this seller and buy another one-no hesitation at all. 'Ella Chen' The story stole my heart! But I was already a die-hard Ella Chen fan :D
B000R209NY|4.0|I like the idea behind this movie. Yes it's a remake of the original but it's not a direct remake. They took the story of the original and made it fresh taking place in today's world with new characters. With this movie you get to see more of the ship ,crew and passengers get turned upside down. What I didnt like was the fact the movie is suppose to take place new years eve 2005 i believe and no one bothered to sent a s.o.s text message from a cell phone lol.

0783114893|5.0|I somehow COMPLETELY overlooked the Hitcher.  All these years this movie was hidden somewhere behind the shadows, but I never found out about it until tonight.  It's exciting and suspenseful the entire way through!  It's about a young kid who picks up a hitchhiker and doesn't realize the possibility exists that the man could be quite dangerous.  Actually the kid even says something like \\"My mom says never pick up hitchhikers\\" while letting the man inside his car on a dark night during a heavy downpour.  From here, it honestly doesn't take long for either the driver of the car (or us, the viewers) to realize this man is deranged and has SEVERAL clever tricks up his sleeve!  The Hitcher doesn't strike me as a dated 80's film like so many other supposed suspense flicks that fall under the same category.  No, this one is REALLY cool unquestionably because of the demented and mysterious actions of the hitchhiker.  Of course it's funny to watch how these type of storylines unfold- the victims always finds themselves in just the right situation to set themselves up for a near death experience, and this film is no exception.  In this case, the crazy hitchhiker goes around killing police officers in the desert and cleverly finds ways to place the blame on the original person who picked him up on that dark rainy night in the beginning of the movie.  The victim spends quite a bit of his time running from the law as a result only to be bailed out by... the bad guy, lol.  It's a life or death cat and mouse game!  Also expect a TON of explosions in typical 80's fashion.  Another element to the suspense factor of this classic, beloved period of filmmaking that I miss dearly- watching things go up in flames suddenly and viciously courtesy of the bad guy!  We need more films like this in todays world, seriously.  I don't care how cheesy many people think they are, these type of films make for some entertaining suspense.  The Hitcher however, manages to do a little bit of both- entertainment and suspense.    Also, expect some pretty spectacular acting all around.  I love it.  Highly recommended!
B0057R5XRG|3.0|Keeping this review short. The films are still fun to watch. However, the picture quality, as some other reviewers have indicated, is very poor for a blu-ray release. Not impressive blu-ray title as far as its technical aspects.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|I have been a heavy metal fan since the mid 80's. I kinda liked Megadeth's \\"So far, so good...so what\\", but wasn't totally impressed by it. I frankly couldn't tell what the big deal with Megadeth was. But when I heard Rust In Peace, it was a game changer for me. I really liked the raw sound, excellent riffs and Marty's melodic solos. To this day, I have not heard another album from any other metal band that can match Rust In Peace. When Megadeth came out with Countdown To Extinction, once again, I was disappointed. Not that it sucked, it actually has some really good songs on it. But it wasn't Rust In Peace. Megadeth's Rust In Peace is a standard by which every other album is judged.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|George Martin is no JRR Tolkein. Despite the glowing reviews, this series of books is somewhat entertaining (at least through the first three volumes) but it is definitely not for children. Too much graphic sex, too little wonder, and absolutely no respect for innocence. If I read one more description of the food eaten, or the clothes worn by his characters, I will puke. Worse, Martin also has a tendency to show the rape, abuse, and molestation of little girls in lurid and graphic detail. Almost as bad as the gratuitous sex forced on underaged girls, he has a tendency to cynically kill off the characters who his readers care about most and are most interested in. Keep your adolescent boys and girls away from this rotten stuff. I find myself regretting the time I have spent plowing through this material in a way I never regretted reading Tolkein. The reviewer who compared this series to Tolkein's great children's fiction should be fired and permanently barred from ever publishing another review.  A Tolkein for our times indeed. Was that reviewer payed to write so gross an untruth?
B000A0GP4K|4.0|Bob Dylan/ No Direction Home/ a martin Scorsese Picture (DVD):  The point of this film is to show the history of Bob Dylan up to the \\"Judas\\" incident when Bob was going electric.  There are some essential moments in this film, which make the film essential for any Dylan fan.  However, Scorsese purposely makes the sound of the key electric performances louder and more chaotic than they really were in order to push the point he (the filmmaker) is trying to make.  That trick was unnecessary and is extremely irritating.  It is a big enough error in judgment to drop this film from five stars to four stars.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is probly my favorite thing on my phone ever. the only bad thing is that it is addicting . I would gladly pay 5 dollars for it. it's only 99 cents though, and it's worth every Penny.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|Chris Cornell absolutely is one of the greatest vocalists of all time. Before Songbook tour, he had been constantly criticized for his unstable vocal performances. I believe that the critics were somewhat right for the Audioslave era in which Chris also admitted that he had problems with alcohol and smoking that could have affected his vocal ability during that time. But man... The Old Chris is back. I watched one of the tours last May in Seattle, and his vocal performance was a way beyond my expectation. After seeing his concert, I also have been watching his Songbook tour videos on Youtube and I have to say that he sounded so good throughout the tour. To me, he sounds even better than how he sounded when he was in Soundgarden in the early 90s. The voice is more mature and powerful than ever before. What surprises me is that his vocal performance was so stable throughout the entire tour despite that he had to perform without much gap between tour dates. Having just one or two days off after performing more than two hours for three or four days in a row, and then performing again, on and on, for a few months is not an easy thing for any musician. Although this may not be much of a problem for many singers whose songs do not require much of vocal range, this is not the case for Chris, as many of his songs are above high C. Also, we all know many vocalists, even those who are considered the greatest of all time, could not maintain their quality of voice when they turned about age of 40. Chris is almost 50 now...! He deserves much respect for keeping his singing ability.<br /><br />As you may hear from the tracks, he does not have any problem with hitting right pitch. \\"Call Me A Dog\\", for example, goes up around high E or F, but he sounds just fine hitting that note. Now if you think about it, what kind of musicians nowadays can hit that note with power, timbre and soul like Chris's while playing a guitar at the same time? Not just this, but also, without losing voiceafter performing for more than two hours for three or four days in a row? I certainly can't think of anyone. Of course, vocal range and power are not the only factors that define a good singer, but they certainly indicate the singer's vocal ability. I am so glad to see that Chris gained his master vocal ability back, and I strongly hope he does more tour like Songbook in the future.<br /><br />A tiny little complain I have about this album is that I wish they made it into two CDs because there are so many songs from the tour that could have been included, such as \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\", \\"Preaching the End of the World\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Getaway Car\\",\\"Redemption Song\\", and especially \\"When I'm Down\\".<br /><br />Anyway, just one unofficial acoustic album- Unplugged In Sweden - was not adequate for a great acoustic live performer like Chris; fans certainly want more. This Songbook album is a must have for all those who thirst for 'that vocal performance'.

0385504225|3.0|Having read the other Dan Brown books featuring Robert Langdon,I found the Lost Symbol to be similar enough but not necessarily more of the same. Brown seems to have dumbed Robert Langdon down for this epic. In The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons langdon seemed to have more depth of understanding and control over everything he encountered. Religious history,secret societies,quantum physics and evil camerlengos didn't seem to phase this James Bond like charactor in tweed. The Robert langdon in The Lost Symbol was tediously dull often seeming confused and overwhelmed.He seemed to have lost his edge. Maybe he is getting old. As in his other books, Brown employs mysterious but factual organizations, places, and things like the metaphysical and quantum physics to keep your interest throughout.The story moves along nicely and has an unexpected twist near the end. There were parts however that I found insultingly unrealistic. Peter Solomon, after having his hand severed just hours earler by his evil estranged son calmly goes on a tour of the Washington Monument with his friend Langdon to look for the lost word. He does later decide, at langdons insistance to stop by the hospital to have that stump looked at. Peter's sister Katherine who has been inpaled with a spigot which drains a good portion of her blood a short time ago decides to spend the rest of the evening site seeing in DC with Langdon. Aside from some of the maddeningly unlikely scenarios I did enjoy the book as I have most of Brown's works.
B000035P7X|5.0|Don't Look Back / Bob Dylan/ Single DVD version:  This is a great film of an amazing group of musicians on tour in 1965.  Seeing Bob Dylan in his tour through England is fascinating enough for any documentary but we also get glimpses of such moments as Alan Price dealing with the aftermath of being fired from The Animals.  We see Albert Grossman wheeling and dealing and chasing out hotel management types.  We see Joan Baez being the muse and Donovan getting Dylan's awards (well, sort of).  There is just so much going on in the film that it never fails to entertain (although it's not always a `comfortable' entertainment).  This is a Classic film.

B003NHRIVQ|3.0|A Review of the Movie The Last Song   In The Last Song, a troubled teenage girl named Ronnie (Miley Cyrus) is sent away for the summer to live with her father whom she has not communicated with for awhile. The connection with her father (Greg Kinnear) is that they both used to love to play the piano, but she finds herself growing apart from that as she gets older. The summer she spends with her father is full of love, laughter, and true feelings that come back to her. The Last Song is an remarkable and stunning movie that sends love to people¡¦s heart and features the true hearts of people who are trying to find what they stand for in life.    Ronnie is not your normal average teenage girl, but what teenager is normal? This film has its ups and downs, but the true meaning towards it comes out as a human being trying to find herself. Ronnie starts her summer out in the town called Tybee Island, Georgia where the set was shot. Her father has a house that is right by the beach, where Ronnie spends most of her time at in the movie. The scenes of the beach are spectacular, calming, and has a lovely significance to them. Ronnie meets a variety of people, which some are great and some not, but everyone is different. I noticed right away that Ronnie seemed like a shy girl at the beginning of the movie when she is around people. She puts up a shield it seems like because she is scared. Ronnie goes to watch a beach volleyball tournament and all the sudden she sees the cutest boy ever who is named Will (Liam Hemsworth). I thought Will was very handsome looking in my opinion and every girl loves a chick flick! º Will gave off a positive, happy, and cheerful sensation to the movie because there were a lot of negative roles in the movie.    Ronnie then falls madly in love with Will seeing how great of a guy he is and knowing it is too good to be true. In time, they spend long, sunny, and hot days together every day; while becoming closer. The wonderful love scenes play immense music while they are laughing, hugging, and kissing. I could see and feel the love of those two people, because I truly think the music made me feel that way. Later in the movie, she finds out her dad has a very bad kind of cancer, which he stopped taking treatments for. Every time there was a downfall to this movie the background music would get depressing, sad, and disheartening. A person that watches this film will know when the movie gets its ups and downs because of the background music and sounds. He gets weaker every day and every second of his last heart beats of his life. Ronnie sends her little brother Jonah (Bobby Coleman) home with her mom Kim Miller (Kelly Preston). Jonah takes it very hard and says goodbye to his dad which is the most touching moment of the movie. I cried when this moment occurred and I do not see how a person cannot cry or feel at least a bit of sadness.  Her dad stopped playing piano because he was getting to weak with his hands and his whole body. Seeing this scene I would say it was the most doubtful part in the movie because knowing he is suffering with a tough sickness. After this scene, the movie started to play songs that were played by pianos and including Ronnie playing also. When Ronnie plays the piano the insanity, love, and hiding of who she is comes out for the first time. Towards the ending, of the movie defiantly had downfalls because of so much sadness, sickness, and uncertain of what is going to happen.   Happiness is the key word in this movie because Ronnie¡¦s father expressed that to her very well. Ronnie finds her true inner self and knows why she is here on this earth. Losing a loved one can be hard, but in the long run it makes people stronger as they live their life. In this paper, I think the weaknesses came out more than the strengths because of how Ronnie had some troubled times with everyone that was in her life. Everyone should watch this movie and see the love, inspiration, and magic it brings to your heart.
B000002JS6|5.0|After the tragic death of lead singer Bon Scott, the future of AC/DC was decidedly uncertain. Angus and Malcom Young, Cliff Williams and Phil Rudd had to decide to call it quits or try and fill the shoes of Bon. On a cold evening in Scotland in dark, dank, and smelly Scottish Pub, they found Brian Johnson, a yet undiscovered and well-underpayed musical talent. After a series of emotional try-outs, Johnson covinced the band that he was the man. What the new AC/DC produced was what would become one of the best-selling hard rock albums of all-time. To date, the album has sold in excess of 20 million copies. Why? After listening to the opening track of the iconic Hells Bells, an omage to the late Bon Scott, one can understand the albums endearing appeal. The next track Shoot To Thrill is a straight up \\"balls to the wall\\" rocker, with some great drumming by Rudd. Back In Black, probably the most recognizable track on the record, has a driving drum beat and agressive guitar work by Angus Young. Another as successful and beloved track of the album is the landmark You Shook Me All Night Long, a great tune about pure lust and unabated debaucery with a lovely large breasted lady. Have A Drink On Me represents Johnsons numerous long evenings in his local pub. The album finishes with Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, AC/DC firmly stating that both their music and Rock And Roll itself will never die. This album is a MUST HAVE for any serious rock fan!

The U.K. version has \\"I'm Free\\" but no \\"Satisfaction\\" (plus other differences).  I prefer the U.S. version.  It's just a matter of how you decide to create your Stones collection.  As a CD, the U.S. \\"heads\\" is great.

1423140591|5.0|I couldn't wait until this book came out that I was counting the days (yes, it is very sad and I don't get out that much.) Anyway, I bought the hardback book the day it came out at Target for $12 and I couldn't wait to read it. I forced myself to wait a whole week until we were on a trip to enjoy it. Don't ask why, but a six hour car ride can fly by when you're reading these books. I was so happy to know what happened to Percy that I didn't put it down the entire time. I was wondering how everything would come together, but it was wonderful and so fast paced. Am I the only one who hates Hera? My brother tried to mess with me and my family made fun, but I continued to read- something most kids don't do now adays. Anywho, loved the book. Can't wait until book three comes out so I can get it and read it. He left the book without a REAL ending!!!!! Pull my hair out mad! Oh well, if it came out in a few months, it wouldn't be any good and I'd waste my money. I'd rather wait a year and get a great book, then wait a few months and get a piece of garbage. Only eleven months to go. Sigh deeply.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|In my opinion, the director accomplished to transport the most important aspects of this character and create a great super-hero movie. I confess that I doubt if the sequel can be as good as this one.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I have used a similar case when using an iPad and was very happy to find a similar one when ordering my Fire. The case itself is sturdy yet thin. It's no Otterbox, but then it's not supposed to be. Like other users I am slightly disappointed in the groove for the stand. The iPad case I used had a tiny flap on the back that secured the stand fold flap. This design does work, but is easily dislodged when removing the weight of the device, making it hard to pick it up, move it, and set it back down with all possible ease. In all I'm very happy with the case and its durability so far.
B00006878K|5.0|Albert King/ Born under a Bad Sign:  Albert knew how to pic songs and make them jump for the radio.  Through these singles, the 60's Rockers learned the right way to construct their own artistry, even after they broke the \\"3 minute radio rule\\".  Besides the historic value of this album, this CD is a fine representation of Albert King's music.
1572704861|5.0|Sam Dastor's reading/enactment enlivens this classic novel that lays out the contradictions of British colonialism in personal terms. Forster gives amazingly nuanced attn to the Indian (Moslem and Hindu) characters as well as the British principals. He navigates well between male and female characters and sensibilities - a hallmark of insightful gay artists, who find themselves between 2 worlds.  The result is that the reader is able to view multiple situations, characters and attitudes, coming away with both the complexity of colonial society and the pratfalls - large and small - that its participants undergo as they try to hang on to status while seeking understanding. They also consciously MISUNDERSTAND things, with near tragic outcomes.  The final chapter has a memorable encounter with Aziz and Fielding, a Moslem \\"vs,\\" an atheist Britisher, as they jockey (they're mounted!) for position and understanding. Not a neat ending, but a satisfying one.  Dastor is brilliant in his characterizations, rivaling the guy who does the Harry Potter books, Jim Dale.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|First off, I have the kindle version and it works just fine, I had no problems with it at all.  Now for the review of the book<br /><br />The first few books started out with a Bang and I thought we were going to get something special and new.  Instead this book has continued what started in the 3rd book with a descent in obsessiveness with mediocre ramblings that while connected to the main story do NOT in any way move the story forward.<br /><br />It's turning into the Wheel of time series for being excessively wordy and boring.  I honestly think that the writer is just writing to make money and not tell a story.<br /><br />The writer just fails to engage beyond the interest created in the first 2 books.  Great you're trying to give us plot twists and intrigue, possible redemption for a few and definite characters that are grey, neither good or bad, just normal.<br /><br />That doesn't mean that the author has to spend pages and pages without moving the story forward.  At this point, I'm not sure I'm going to read the rest of the books.  I don't like getting bilked and that's what this is starting to feel like.
0061537969|5.0|This book is not at all about racing, ok, maybe it is a little bit.  But it is more about families and relationsips and doing the right thing.  It is told through the eyes and ears of a dog, and what a dog Enzo is, the book is funny, heartwarming, heartbreaking, and impossible to put down, best book I have read in several years and certainly right up there with my all time favorites.
0439023513|3.0|After reading this book, I must say I have mixed feelings about its quality.  I understand and appreciate the author's desire to portray PTSD and the brutality of war.  I think it's great to get young adults thinking about these issues and realizing that there are worse things to worry about than who came to so-and-so's party and who didn't last night.  I thought the first book and, to a somewhat lesser degree the second book, did a fantastic job of that!  But in Mockingjay, everything just felt forced.  It felt as though the author first wrote down her theme (Why war is terrible and the real effects it has on people) and then wrote, making everything subservient to that theme.    I think we have to remember a few things here.  This book is for young adults.  And, this is a trilogy.  One of my friends mentioned that as a stand alone book for adults, this would have been fair to middling.  But the losses that are depicted are written so quickly and the young reader is not given any time to process or deal with them. Yes, that's how it works in the real world of battle.  But there's a reason 14 year olds aren't heading into battles.  And when they've spent months investing in a series and then have the level of content hatcheted up to a level too far above so many of them---it's just not fair.  I think a some adults would have trouble dealing with the level of depression and despair in this novel. Teenagers already have such a high rate of depression, and their brains are literally not fully developed.  Also, there were so many loose ends not wrapped up. The ending of the book felt so rushed and incomplete.  I'm not complaining that the author didn't spell everything out for readers.  I think she just did a poor job with the writing.  It was extremely anti-climactic, poorly put together, and unclear.    Just because a book is sad and depressing and makes you come away saying \\"Wow, war is awful\\" doesn't mean it's a good book.  Was the writing good?  Was the plot well-formulated?  Were the characters gripping?  It felt like the author was just holding in mind the thought that she wanted to blow readers away with depressing PTSD, and she made every other aspect of the book subservient to that theme.  Look at any class or book or conference on how to write quality fiction---that's one of the worst mistakes you can make.  The depressing theme also doesn't mean the book is realistic.  In reality, I don't think Katniss would have been such a standout in terms of battle, when she's fighting with citizens from 13 who have been training for battle their whole lives.  The idea that she alone has what it takes to take out Snow, and that everyone in her squad agrees with her, when in reality she's a 17-year-old girl in the grips of often-disabling PTSD who barely made it through basic training and is barely holding it together...has no previous battle experience (The Hunger Games are just not like a real combat unit---yes, there's death but the dynamic is completely different than a real military unit)...I just found myself thinking, \\"Seriously?\\"  And that no one would have stepped in and stopped Peeta from being sent to the frontlines, when he was clearly so unfit for duty?  No on stepped in to stop Prim from being sent to the frontlines?  Not her mother?  Not Haymitch?  No one actually bothered to investigate what she was doing there even after she died?  So much about this book was completely unrealistic.  The rest of it was pointlessly depressing. Not the kind of depressing that makes a reader more empathetic in the future, or more understanding of how to avoid war.  Just needlessly, pointlessly depressing.  A lot of what I felt were such important points for kids to grasp were written so hazily that I think kids mostly missed them!    This book could have been soooo much better.  I just feel the author really dropped the ball on on this one.  I'm glad for those of you who enjoyed it.  I just didn't have the same experience at all.
B000002P72|5.0|B. B. King/ Live At The Regal: This is B.B. King at his very best, at his most exciting. This album is one of the greatest albums of all time.  B. B. King in a small club with an audience fully involved in rising the artist up to performing at the top of his talents.  This is one of a handful of albums worthy to contend for \\"best live album of all time\\".  There should be a sixth star for albums as special as this.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in years! Finally an entertaining movie with intelligence, humor, lovely scenes of Paris, great music - and a message. No crashing cars, burning buildings, or blatant and meaningless sex. A marvelous and intriguing story line....And one could actually hear the dialogue in the absence of background noise so increasingly annoying lately. I saw it in a theater and recommend that if it's still out near you but I will also have to own this one. Woody Allen....a master.  jean

B001DELWZY|5.0|To be honest with you, I bought this Opera because of the great price break under which it was being offered. I am a ballet lover, and that is the art form most of my dollars go into, but I am beginning to collect some of the great operas too. Verdi is known to have some very good ballet in most of his operas, and this one has some very good dancing included. This opera has several exceptionally beautiful arias by three of the principles, and all expressed themselves very well with their voices as well as their facial and body mannerisms. From the very beginning Gheorghiu was able to show us that Violetta was quite ill, and knowing the story of the lady of the Camelias, was not all that important. The only thing that was slightly confusing was the argument presented by Giorgio Germont as to why Violetta should leave his son Alfredo. I had to read the novel to understand what he was concerned about.<br /><br />All in all this is one of the best operas I have. It is full of heart rending emotion, so it is well to have a few tissues handy. If you can't cry for Violetta, you probably cannot cry for anyone. This opera was taken from the story (and play) written by the Son of the famous author of \\"The Three Musketeers\\" and \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\", Alexandre Dumas (Pere). His name is Alexandre Dumas (Fils) or junior. The son did not become as famous as the father, but his book (and later the play by the same title) \\"The Lady of the Camelias\\" was very good, and was the setting for this opera, and two others, plus many movies and a ballet by the same title, \\"The Lady of the Camelias\\"....[[ASIN:0199540349 La Dame aux Cam&eacute;lias (Oxford World's Classics)]].... If you love ballet, you owe it to yourself to get the ballet, you won't be sorry....[[ASIN:B0025XW95Y Chopin: La Dame aux Camelias [Blu-ray]]].....It is also available in standard DVD format.<br /><br />This story, and the ballet, may make you sympathize with the profession of prostitution. If you read the book, you will probably be willing to think kindly of Violetta, since her own father loaned her out to his friends at the age of twelve, but when she discovered how valuable she was, her standard of living increased dramatically. In her day Violetta the courtesan, was looked upon in a different light than a woman in the same profession today. Violetta was only 20 or 22 years of age when she died. So get this opera, and hear how Verdi immortalized a common, but beautiful prostitute. This story is true, and the person of Alfredo is actually Alexandre Dumas (Fils) himself. The names were changed in the novel, and Verdi also changed the names for his opera.lling to think kindly of Violetta, since her own father loaned her out to his friends at the age of twelve, but when she discovered how valuable she was, her standard of living increased dramatically.

042524489X|3.0|Ummm...I was really looking forward to this book since we learned that Hawke lost his future mate when he was a child.  I had high hopes.  I was not entirely disappointed, I just expected a little more.  I did like Walker's story but definitely thought he should have gotten a whole book especially if Max and Dev got one.  I also thought that Hawke deserved a whole book to himself.  I still liked it very much but I just wanted more.

1451627289|5.0|I am not a Stephen King addict but did enjoy \\"Hearts of Atlantis\\" and \\"The Girl who loved Tom Gordon\\".  As a baby boomer this was the perfect book for me.  I realize I am repeating other impressions but too bad.  This book is perfect for those of us who love: a good story, engaging characters who I came to love,  and history I have experienced.  Though it was long it left me wanting more.  What a pleasant experience.  Who has not considered or wished for  time travel especially now that we are getting more senior.  I must know how Sadie's life developed in the absence of George's influence. I need to know.   Buy it, and enjoy the ride.  11/28/11  I just reread \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" and as I suspected both books are wonderful.  At the time I thought he had tied up the loose ends better in 1998 but upon rereading, he left the ends quite loose much like 11-2-63.  I guess a few sequels might be in order.  Wonderful fiction but counter productive for working people.
B0011UBDTK|3.0|I was thrilled to find that I could catch up on the earlier shows of Sex in the City, but the quality of the DVDs are horrible.  The videos are pixilated, play slowly, and a gross disappointment.  I'd send them back but the replacements would be the same.  I'm sad
B004LWZW24|1.0|A little boy astral projects while he's sleeping. His parents don't know this even though he draws pictures of it and they are right on his wall. Apparently the last time he astral projected he went into the \\"Further\\" where he gets stuck for some reason. There are lots of dead people there just sitting around. Dead people also want to get into his body but so far they have only succeeded in scaring his mother. Although many times she doesn't even scream - like when a small boy/man suddenly jumps out of a cupboard right in front of her and runs off. She just looks. The husband was an astral projector when he was young but he doesn't remember. His mom is played by Barbara Hershey so I kept comparing this to The Entity which was awful also. Anyway she took photos of him and an old woman was always in the background of the photos getting closer with each photo. She wanted to steal his body. So after that he could not stand to get his picture taken. Even though he doesn't remember all this. So, did his mom show him the photos? That wouldn't be a good idea. The photos had nothing to do with the woman wanting to steal his body, the astral projecting did.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like wasting your time, and enjoy getting really angry at stupid, unsurprising endings, watch this movie!

030788743X|3.0|I'm honestly surprised by the incredible reviews this book has received.  It's fun, especially if you're a child of the 80s, but not amazing.  I agree with another reviewer that it often just sounds like a list of 80s references strung together.  I think the idea is very creative, but I read Snow Crash just before reading this, and Snow Crash is a much better written and more unique story centered around a virtual reality world.  Ready Player One gets better towards the end as the action picks up and the characters get a little more developed, and the story develops more heart, but it's definitely a first time novel from a beginner author, who will hopefully get better over time.  Many of the game hunt sequences are solved too quickly, and the story is actually pretty straightforward with no twists and turns or suspense.  All in all, a good read but fairly forgettable.
0307887898|3.0|This book was a fast read for me and it kept me engaged from the first page. I found the first half of the book to be much more insightful and engrossing as the second half became somewhat repetitive and only scattered with useful insights. I love the author's concepts of 'Minimum Viable Products' and 'Vanity Metrics vs. Actionable Metrics.'  Even with these pros, I found reading the book somewhat similar to eating Chinese food - satisfying while doing it but leaving me hungry an hour after finishing. As other reviewers have noted, the book is short on specifics. And although I believe a non-fiction book should be a marketing piece for the author's services, there's a minimum amount of useable information that readers expect for buying and spending time reading the material. I felt this book came up at least slightly short of that amount.  It would have been nice if Mr. Ries could have provided some examples from the non-tech world. Personally, I'm not tech-phobic, but a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities I'd like to pursue reside outside of the high tech industry. It's easy to see how the concepts Mr. Ries explains apply to IMVU (the company he helped found/build), but more of a stretch to conceive of them in environments where more fixed assets are required.  Overall, it's got some concepts that entrepreneurs need to know and master. But if you're a scrappy bootstrapper, you'll be wondering if it'll be more cost-effective to figure out the details and master those concepts on your own or to hire Mr. Ries as your start-up consultant.

1451627289|2.0|11/22/1963 is an enjoyable read, but not worth a purchase. King knows how to build velocity but his detours linger in odd places. His main character grows out of the construction entirely and needs to be stuffed, awkwardly, back into the premise at least once. King thumps at pet phrases, mostly pushing forward but other times a descriptive repetition stops the momentum dead: lazy editing showing the seams of construction- a note card used twice. Paperback copies will be floating around your local library's free book pile by next summer.

B000000WHC|5.0|I've been slinging rock/blues guitar for over 40 years, and hands-down, Gary Moore was the finest guitar player I've ever heard. Period. I had heard of him for years but hadn't followed his music until this album was released. I was driving down the road in Sacramento, CA....and this gorgeous, haunting blues song comes out of the car radio. I literally pulled over to listen; a very rare thing for me. Oddly, I somehow 'knew' it was this Gary Moore guy I'd heard so much about; don't ask me how I knew this.   I became a huge fan at that moment, and have remained so. No one can touch me with the guitar the way Gary could and does. He was known for being fast yet clean; his tone was beyond reproach. Yet, listen to the heart the man poured into his playing. That, my friends, is what makes a truly great guitar player.   I've said for years that music should either move you or make you want to shake your a**. Gary can do both....sometimes even within the same song.   Therefore, this is a MUST-HAVE for your music collection, but then check out his other work. \\"The Loner\\" is still one of the prettiest instrumentals I've ever heard in my life, with the most gorgeous chorus you'll ever experience.   R.I.P., Gary. You gave us all so much.....and you're missed.

B005ETA5K2|5.0|As of today, 11/21/11, this does not work with BackTrack 5 (or any backtrack) running within VMWare. Alfa does have Linux drivers on their website, which I checked for before I purchased, so I assumed (incorrectly) that it would be fine with BT5. I was wrong.   There are workarounds using \\"compatible\\" drivers from other products, but none that release the full functionality of this device. Just a heads up for those (like me) who wanted this for testing purposes.  I won't knock any stars from it, as in Windows 7 this things works amazingly well. With a Dlink wireless N USB adapter (can't recall model number), I could generally get about 3-4 networks near my house...and all were less than 2-3 bars excluding my router. When I plugged in this Alfa adapter, it picked up 14 wireless networks and the signal strength was up to 4-5 bars on the previously low signal ones. In fact, many of the AP's, that the other adapter didn't even see had at least 3-4 bars.   So, great product..we just need some BT support.
1463514581|5.0|There have been very few books that I have been unable to put down, and very few authors that I want to read everything they write. Lord of the Rings, Narnia, well anything by CS Lewis catches my attention, the Harry Potter series, but other then these, not many books or authors do that for me. Denise Swank is a newer author and has several books out, and her book 28 and a Half Wishes was one of those books that I could not put down. Denise tells a story about a non-interesting girl named Rose who is more then what people think she is. And how trouble seems to follow this young woman who through a traumatic family event she discovers how amazing she really is. How she can use her \\"gift\\" to help out instead of being known as the town freak. Denise created a character that when you are done reading this book you wish you had a friend like her. The way she talks about her town, the people in her life, and the crazy comments she comes up with, will have you laughing through the whole story. There is humor, suspense, violence, silliness, and even a little bit of romance. Something for everyone! 28 and a Half Wishes is a book that everyone will find humor and enjoyment in reading. I had to remind myself a few times that Rose was not a real character, and that I really was not friends with her in real life. That is they type of author Denise is. Her work is extremely believable. There were several scenes in the book that after reading, I thought for a minute that it really happened that that it was from my memory. It is a fantastic book, worth the read! I am really hoping she doesnt take to long to continue the story...

0307593312|5.0|1Q84 is a very difficult book to describe.  I could tell you that it fits in the genre \\"magical realism\\", that it contains a female assassin, religious cults, kinky sex, long-lost love, mysterious \\"little people\\" and alternate realities.  I could also tell you that there is tension and a sense of foreboding on every page.  But all of that would be misleading because the story moves along at a very leisurely pace and there is very little actual action or violence.  You might also think that 1Q84 is a tale of good versus evil, but that would be way too simplistic as Murakami blurs such distinctions.  All I can say is that this is a very strange, one of a kind novel that I enjoyed immensely.

B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Part of me thinks that this should have been the seventh movie . . .  feeling like the studio milked the last book.  They should have cut Part One down to about 30~45 minutes, and merged that remainder into the beginning of Part Two, then released the whole as a 2:30 or perhaps 3:00 hour movie and be done.  Part One dragged on so badly I almost lost interest.  Part Two is exciting, has great visuals and plot, and moves along at a pace that keeps me interested.  The actual movie length is just at 2 hours.  Add in about 10 minutes of credits and you get the 130 minute length as advertised.<br /><br />Rating Part Two at five stars for the movie.  I never rated Part One, but it would have been three stars at best because so little was accomplished during the time they took.  Like I said, the studio really milked the last book for all they could -- knowing it was the end of a very successful series.<br /><br />Noticing that hundreds of people have hopped onto this product review page to give it one star for the UltraViolet streaming digital copy included in the Multi-format package.  While I personally could not care less for the digital copies of any movie, I certainly understand the anger about this issue.<br /><br />1) It's a streaming form instead of a digital copy.<br />2) It does not match what was delivered with Part One, or any of the previous movies in the series.  That means that anyone with a digital library of the movies that wants to watch the series offline . . . cannot.  It breaks the collection.<br />3) It's STILL a digital copy that punishes legal customers but does zero to punish actual pirates.  This last statement is unfortunately true of previous digital copy methods that use online registration based DRM.<br /><br />When will the studios learn that to succeed at digital delivery they need to make it seamless and flawless for their paying customers?<br /><br />Having said that, I still feel like 5 stars for this edition is deserved.  I'm rating the quality of the movie, the Bluray disks and the packaging here.  If I were to rate the digital copy, I would rate ALL digital copies a one because of their DRM.  Not just UltraViolet . . .  I don't and won't register online with my email address with every studio on the planet to activate any digital copy.  Not now, not ever.<br /><br />.
B0065CCT6U|5.0|I was lucky enough to see Chris Cornell on the tour for this album at the Sixth & I Historic Synagogue in Washington DC and it was one of the greatist shows I have ever seen. Let me just say that I do not love all of Chris' solo stuff, but there is no denying the AMAZING voice he has rock icon that he is. Seeing him while sitting in pews in a old church only enhanced that effect. He was amazing and this CD represents the performance very well. Dont hesitate if you like Chris at all ... this is an AMAZING album!
B002ZG980U|4.0|This is a science fiction film that, as its director says, \\"explores the potential of the human mind.\\" It is based on the idea that people using the proper equipment and skills can enter other people's mind while the people are asleep and implant ideas into their head that the people thinks are their own ideas. A very rich man who owns a huge business is dying. He left his estate to his son. A competitor wants Leonardo Dicaprio and his team to kidnap the son and implant the idea that he wants to divide the large business into smaller parts. The competitor explains that as long as the business is large, he has no chance of competing and making money. But if it is divided into small businesses, he can, with a larger business, beat them all. Dicaprio and his team accept the challenge, but the system requires that they also enter the victims mind when they are asleep, when their own subconscious may sabotage their plans. Dicaprio has many unresolved psychological problems that interfere with his plans in this fast-moving film.
1451629184|5.0|Other reviewers have written about this remarkable woman, her survival against all odds, her compassion for other abductees.<br />In the first third of the book her writing style enabled me to understand how her abductor brainwashed her and made her so dependent on him that she could not escape. This diabolical man (whom she refuses to call evil, but calls him \\"selfish\\") very cleverly set about training her to be grateful for any little thing that was given her. If you put yourself in her shoes you can realize that she never thought there was any option but to stay. There is no way that a woman in her circumstance with 2 children could even contemplate what would happen if she escaped or told somebody. If she did, how would she and her children survive? Their survival was completely dependent on her abductors.<br /><br />Besides being a book that demonstrates Jaycee's growth, this book is a great psychological study of brainwashing techniques and how a person can be imprisoned without walls. It also tells about her recovery and her remarkable therapy. Every student of psychology should read this book and be touched.
0525423656|4.0|Love the cover. Really. Love it.<br />I was anxiously awaiting this book. I mean really, from the very last page of Matched I wanted this book. The book is told in alternating POV (point of views) Between Cassia and Ky. hmmm. I can't say that I hated it. You got a little more insight on Ky. His thoughts. Fears. Struggles. His fight. As well, as Cassia's. I cannot whole heartily say that I loved this concept of the book. It threw me off a bit in the beginning. I grew to really like it though. Just took me longer to get 'into' the book. Because I kept forgetting 'who' I was reading about. After all is said and done, and I have thought about it. I liked that I got to know Ky a little more. Understand somethings about him. It is always good to know more about other characters, from there point of view.<br />Now: For the actual words & book itself:<br />Cassia,<br />I know which life is my real life now, no matter what happens. It's the one with you. For some reason know that even one person knows my story makes things different. Maybe it's like the poem says. Maybe this is my way of not going gentle.I love you<br />This is the letter Ky wrote Cassia, at the end of Matched. *Sigh*. Crossed takes place a couple months later. Where Cassia and Ky are trying to find each other.<br />You will follow both of them on their journey to be together again. This book is that. A journey.<br />The fights, fear, secrets, love, heartbreak, and everything in between Cassia & Ky's journey... to be together again.<br />You will meet new characters. Eli & Indie being the ones that I liked the most. Although, Indie... I don't know if I can fully say that I like her... just yet. That is a determination that I will have to make in book 3, which the title has not been released yet.<br />Overall this book was great. I loved seeing the love between Cassia and Ky. Even apart, the determination to be together, was... so real. So determined! Cassia grew so mush during this book. This book was amazing. The writing style is so beautiful. I will tell you. Do not just DEVOUR this book. [kinda hard] but, read it. slowly. Enjoy the writing. The flow, the magnificence of this book. [trust me] I read it 2x! I cannot wait for the release of this book, so that I can have it on my shelf. I enjoyed this. I hope that in book 3 maybe we will see a little more about Xander. ;D<br />I love the covers. Green = Cassia in a bubble. Blue = Her breaking Free... WHAT will the next cover color be?! What do you think? I think..... red. The color of all the tablets.(Right?!).. But, what will the name be! hmmm. I guess we will have to wait & see!<br />\\"I run for her.<br />I run for them.<br />For me.\\"<br />  ~Kyul. I will tell you. Do not just DEVOUR this book.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|[[ASIN:B004XGN8W4 G155-Gaming and Entertainment Mobile System (Xbox 360/ PS3 Not included)]]  Great for a 'take along' video game system. Have used it for a couple of weeks now. No problems after initial set up (nothing tells you that your Xbox 360 must be set to run in 720 HD...or at least I didn't see anything). Have taken it multiple places and as long as you have 2 plug ins available, it takes about 2 minutes to plug everything in and set it up before you're gaming.
144234430X|5.0|Wow.       I am a sci-fi fan, and don't read a lot of King.  But this appealed to me, and so I gave it a try.  Not a lot of sci-fi here, but the story itself -- what a yarn!  I typically like books that get to the point, and don't go down many side roads.  This one doesn't do that, but I still loved it.  Each and every path King takes is interesting, well paced, and entertaining.  Especially worth the read was the vivid and engaging settings of a time gone by.  I didn't live through the early 60's, but I've often wondered what it was like then.  This book does an outstanding job showing both the gentle era and it's shortcomings.  I'd put this in the page-turner category, as I just wanted to keep reading.  Fantastic story that kept my attention all the way through.     This review would not have been written if not for the audiobook version.  I think this may have been the best audiobook I've ever listened to, and I've heard hundreds.  It's not a production like a BBC audiobook, of course, but the reader is SO good, he literally didn't need to tell me who was talking -- his voices for each character were each so distinct, I could tell immediately.  His laughs at the right time, his timing, everything about the way it was read continued to drive me deeper into the fantasy.  If you've never tried audiobooks, this would be a great one to start.  If you're already a fan, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.  Five stars, something I don't give out very much.

B005N95JA4|5.0|I well remember when Some Girls hit the stores. I was already a Stones fan, but the Stones had lost their mojo among the unwashed masses during the mid 70s. But Some Girls came out with a bang, and suddenly everyone was jumping on the bandwagon. The album was played at all the best parties. It really went a long, long way in returning the Stones to the top, a position they held through Tattoo You and the '81 tour. The Stones had returned to their basic, two guitar sound. The Taylor/Richards era provided a clear lead/rhythm guitar split. The result was incredible, but sadly, could not last after Taylor's exit. Ron Wood's contribution to the band's sound has been severely under-rated, but he has also been just the \\"little brother\\" to the dominating Glimmer Twins. Wood needs to be credited with kicking the Twins in the arse, bringing new life to a band that was quickly becoming irrelevant.<br /><br />The Paris sessions that resulted in Some Girls provided a wave of tracks that the Stones would ride through the next three albums. Even then, a lot was left on the tapes, which found their way into bootleggers' hands. Nothing on the second disc of the Deluxe Edition hasn't been heard before by diehard Stones fans. However, these oft-bootlegged tracks have been overdubbed to release standards. Why? Because the Stones are lazy f---ers (by their own admission) and what they put on their albums was what was finished, and they finished the songs they felt were the best of the lot. There never has been a lot of release-ready tracks languishing in vaults ala Springsteen. Even when there was a complete song or two available, they ended up on B-sides. And that is why the Stones never rushed to put out a rarities set unless to collect B-sides and extended mixes that had been released in other formats. Not until Exile On Main St. did the band discover that the public really would buy old tracks that were dusted off and \\"finished.\\"<br /><br />So far the band has done an excellent job in retaining the sound and texture of the original album in tracks finished off over 30 years later. But I am not sure that the casual fans for whom Some Girls was the first Stones album they ever purchased will care about the bonus disc. There really is nothing there that overshadows the original release, or makes one think, \\"Why did they leave that one off?\\" For those types who already have Some Girls on CD, I doubt the remastered single disc edition will gain much traction. However, the buzz on Stones message boards among the diehards was very favorable to the EOMS deluxe edition, and I expect the same for the SG deluxe edition as well.<br /><br />Reports are that Don Was (who produced the bonus disc) wants to tackle Beggars Banquet or Let It Bleed next. He's been quoted as saying that the vaults could produce an album of new Stones songs every year for the next 50 years. I think he's exagerrating, but I look forward to more fine releases in this series.und and texture of the original album in tracks finished off over 30 years later.

0553801473|1.0|The first three books in this series are fantastic.  I loved every word.  The fourth, I struggled with...and was very frustrated when NOTHING happened!<br /><br />This was the same.  So much was packed into the first three books, and these last two could have been shrunk to a single chapter each.<br /><br />I won't buy any more in this series....I'm moving on
B004SDSSFY|1.0|After downloading, I tried to open the app. It directed me to download now to unlock the full version. After clicking on that button it took me to a page that could not be open. I have since deleated the app because you can't use the features.
B005WZZRD8|5.0|This is perfect! Is cheap and it has great content! I love it! Respect your money! BUY THIS NOW! It includes a 130 minutes DVD, the full album (Born this way) and 'The Remix' and another more things. It's great!
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I was debating for months if I should get Quick Office Pro or Documents to go ... until now. I got both of them and the decision was easy since Documents to go STOP WORKING after I install the full version key. Quick Office Pro works very well and for me the only feature I would like to add is the ability to resize pictures in word documents.  (Motorola Xoom. )
B005HSG3U6|3.0|Does what it says it should, but its way over priced for what you get. Would expect it to be a little nicer and better made for the asking price. At $20 or less it would be a good value.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I still a lot.of people are having problems installing this program.  Just go to the Android Market and get the ree Documents to go app and then go back to amazon and download the full version again.  Other than this little glitch, this is a great app.

B005OLF6BI|5.0|This woman never stops topping herself. She is such an exceptional artist. All her songs have such strong meanings and easily relatable topics. This year alone she has been named Entertainer of the Year for the second time, Billboard Woman of the Year for 2011, and Top Artist of 2011 by the American Music Awards. These awards just go to show how much her fans love her because of all her hard work and dedication. This album is a wonderful addition to any Taylor Swift's collection. This is a great subsitute for not being able to see the concert in person, as well as a great item to keep those memories for those who went. She never fails to amaze me. She is so perfect and the most deserving entertainer. I love Taylor Swift with all my heart, and this is just another great gift she's given to us fans. Talk about an early Christmas present <3
B005CWRB44|4.0|I was interested in the Fenix E15 because I wanted a CR123A battery flashlight that was more compact and brighter than the old Inova CR123A-battery flashlights that I own.  Because the CR123A lithium batteries have a long shelf life, I have some batteries originally bought for use in compact 35mm cameras and my early LED flashlights that are still usable.  Because in recent years I have used digital cameras that do not use the CR123A batteries instead of the old 35mm film cameras and because I have used AA-battery LED flashlights instead of the CR123A-battery flashlights, I have not used up my CR123A batteries.  I did carry my Inova X5 second generation 2X CR123A-battery flashlight, but it is so much dimmer than the new AA-battery LED flashlights that I stopped carrying the X5 even as a backup flashlight in my briefcase.  The Fenix E15 seemed to have the compact size, brightness, and reasonable price that suited my need, so I ordered it.  The E15 using a single CR123A battery is so much brighter than my old Inova X5 -- very impressive for its size and price!  However, considering the difference in cost of the CR123A battery vs. the AA battery, I plan to still use my AA-battery flashlights for my primary everyday flashlight uses.  The E15 is very compact and shorter in length than the single AA-battery Fenix E11, but the E11 has a tailcap momentary-on forward clicker switch and uses the twisting head only to change the brightness level.  The brightness level of the E11 can be set to high or low by tightening or loosening the head and pressing the switch thereafter will turn on the flashlight at that setting.  In comparison, the E15 has to be turned on and off twice by twisting the head in order to cycle through the middle and low levels of brightness to reach the highest level of brightness each time that the flashlight is turned on.  So the E11 is more convenient to use, including for occasional tactical use.  Furthermore, for use as a small keychain light, the single AAA-battery flashlights, such as the Fenix E05, are much smaller than the E15 and the AAA batteries are much cheaper.

B005R4255C|2.0|After reading the song titles on the so-called new MJ CD Immortal, I said WTH!!! It is cute (emphasis on the word cute) to hear his classics remixed but if U are a real MJ fan, U gonna be a bit pissed. After all of the media attention surrounding his untimely death and its aftermath, to put out this rehashed remix is a travesty and only being done to cash in on his name.  I am almost starting to believe Latoya in that they wanted him dead because he is worth more gone than being here.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|I have been looking forward to this since I heard it was getting written. A story with time travel and heading back to when Kennedy was around with the chance to change the future, fabulous idea. Jake is a great character who changes and grows and he goes through the mind boggling experience of time travel whilst trying to keep his mind focused on the task in hand he can't help but get caught up in other peoples lives.  The only thing that might annoy some readers is that the story doesn't just go straight to Kennedys assassination, there is a whole chunk (3 quarters of the book) of what he does until that time, the characters he meets and relationships he builds up. However I really liked that aswell as the characters all play an important part to the story and for a small part we have a link to one of Stephen Kings previous books, I love when a character from a previous story shows up (even if in passing or a small part).  I have often heard people say Stephen King isn't as good as he once was however I would say pick this up and give it a go, it will restore your faith and rekindle the love for Stephen Kings writing. 4/5 for me.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|The stock alarm is good if your just too lazy to find another option. This app has many great features that user overlook at first becoming dissatisfied with it. this app allows the creation of many different alarms. so whether you need to wake up the same time every day or switch up a day or 2 you'll have them programmed. Given you check off the right alarm you won't have any worries because it overrides silent functions (so you don't have to worry about turning your volume on or up) make sure you know all the features of the app your reviewing before you give it one star. because if you don't like this app then you obviously don't know what your missing.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The UV copies of movies has improved by allowing you to link to multiple streaming services which has changed my initial view of the service.<br /><br />Linking it to Flixster now allows you to have a downloaded copy on your device.  Provided that your device has a Flixster app on it, this works very well.<br /><br />You can also link via VuDu now as well.  The flexibility this offers is quite nice as many new TVs have this application available.<br /><br />Of course the movie itself is great!  :D<br /><br />I actually prefer it to iTunes now.

B0064XWI98|5.0|Big time rush is the one of the best bands ever. They are probably one of the only bands that can actually sing live. I've listened to the cd and this one, I think is better than their first. It's alot more upbeat and makes the guys sound older. Elevate is probably the best of all the songs, in my opinion.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|Dataviz is obviously the most paranoid of all the app developers.  Their elaborate copy protection scheme backfired and most people including me are just getting a key and unable to get the app itself.  NO ... they couldn't just let us download the app like all the other apps ... this app is extra special and deserves a whole new way to screw up.  Now I'm stuck in a loop.  I start the app which sends me to a link to purchase the app from amazon again.

0066620996|2.0|I'm about ten to fifteen percent of the way through the book.  I intend to finish it, although it will be painful.    I believe that there are some good nuggets of information in this book, and anyone who runs a business or intends to do so will benefit from the information in the book.  However, between those valuable nuggets exists extravagant fluff, repetition, and flowery language.  The book could probably be more effective at half the size.  As you read, I would suggest that you skim, paying attention to mostly thesis statements, and final conclusions.  Everything in between is not worth much at all.
B004SEVPWQ|1.0|When it works it is fun but keeps freezing up and not responding on my Kindle. 1st app I have had a problem with.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I hate paying big bucks for a book for my Kindle, but Stephen King's latest book, 11/22/63, was worth every penny and more! Hardcover or Kindle, don't pass this one by! The story is interesting, it really pulls the reader in quickly and makes him feel like he is there in the story. When I finished the book, I felt like the characters were close friends of mine (a tribute few authors can accomplish for me) and I missed them already. Brilliant, Mr. King, brilliant!
B0051MKMNC|4.0|When this came out, I saw one or two previews and blew it off.  Finally, I took a shot on it and I came away satisfied.  Limitless is Johnny Mnemonic with American Psycho minus the mediocrity and murder.  Ever see Strange Days with Ralph Fiennes?  Yeah, this is the movie it was supposed to be.  Bradley Cooper, in his most tolerable role yet,  is a mumbling post modern hippy trying to finish a book.  One day an old friend gives him a skittle on steroids and he becomes a superhero Einstein, stealing a nooner with the landlords woman after impressing her with law speak. Great concept, mostly great execution.  Director Neil Burger employs an inventive use of vanishing point zooms to draw us, and our Walter Mitty through the vortex of a speed freak with a bottomless diet of knowledge.  It's a fun ride all the way through.  The disappointments are few.  Robert de Niro  feels superfluous as does the ravishing Abbie Cornish.  Also, despite the hook and \\"speed\\" of the narrative, it feels like we get short changed in the end as if the story doesn't go as far as we want it too.  The element of risk dissipates and the finality plays the safe card.  Bah, it's still great stuff and Andrew Howard steals this one as the Ruskie shylock.
0156034026|3.0|This is a good and interesting novel but it's been wildly over-praised having won or been nominated for several major prizes. To begin, the title is misleading. The narrator and protagonist, Changez--I have no idea how to pronounce that, like French changez? or hard g?--is not a \\"fundamentalist\\" in any possible sense of that word. Religion is perhaps mentioned twice when he notes that Pakistan and Afghanistan share a border and a religion, Islam. But he isn't at all interested in religion, nor could he by any stretch of the imagination be called a political \\"fundamentalist.\\" Slowly, perhaps but not necessarily \\"reluctantly\\" he yields to his strong perceptions of how much damage America does in his part of the world and also elsewhere. The progression of his thought on these matters is well-done but there's not a particularly original insight anywhere.    Reviewers have praised Changez's \\"voice.\\" But that's silly. It's a fine first-person monologue but there's nothing special about the writing. The convention employed by the author, that Changez is telling his story to a foreigner--probably an American-over tea, then dinner, then on a walk back to the foreigner's hotel is purely a convention: it's not in the least plausible that anyone would listen to this talk which, if we were to consider it realistically, would probably consume a great many hours.     The other strand of the story, the narrator's infatuation with a woman who is irrevocably tied to a lover who has died, is somewhat interesting, but it doesn't relate in any way to what is presumably the main thread of the story, the narrator's \\"reluctant\\" turn to something that isn't at all \\"fundamentalist.\\"     This is a solid piece of work, worth one's time. But it is hardly the major work it's been touted to be.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|bought this app way back when it was 9.99. Has never disappointed me. I don't like to buy apps when there are so many free ones out there but reliability and functionality makes this a great AoD.

B005PTQPU0|4.0|We are in danger of being spoilt. Two albums in a year from Kate Bush is some feat even if \\"Directors Cut\\" didn't quite hit the mark. Now there is the sullen crystalline beauty of \\"50 words for snow\\" an icy requiem to winter, snow, snowmen, drifts, Christmas and much more. This album has only seven songs but it exceeds an hour and centers on the creation of piano driven soundscapes that glisten and ripple at a glacial pace. This is no traditional Santa ridden clich&eacute;d Christmas album. The chill moods of these songs are such that you almost see your breath in the winter air and feel the weight of snow-covered trees. It starts with \\"Snowflake\\" a stunning hymn to the little cloud droplets that echoes Robert Frost's poem \\"Stopping by the woods on a snowy evening\\". The songs haunting piano coda plays out over nearly ten minutes where Kate Bush's 13 year old son Bertie brings a eerie \\"Snowman\\" choirboy quality when he intones \\"I can see horses wading through snowdrifts/My broken hearts, my fabulous dances/My fleeting song, fleeting\\". Bush's vocal is a joy which she then goes on to better in the next two exquisite songs that proceed against the backdrop of the musical whiteout. \\"Lake Tahoe\\" is over 11 minutes and starts with the dulcet tones of English counter tenor Stephan Roberts. Its piano meanders carving out blissful melodies over Kate Bush's best vocal on the album with a song infused with an almost Talk Talk ambience. Next up \\"Misty\\" is about the love of a human for a snowman, which suggests frivolity, but far from it. Starting like a Keith Jarrett jazz composition, Bush proceeds over nearly 14 minutes to chart the inevitable waning of doomed passion. Ultimately these three ballads are more akin to the type of moody but euphoric soundtracks produced by Thomas Newman. By any standards they represent an opening of near perfection and combined with the glorious finale to the album the sublime \\"Among angels\\" you could not ask for more brilliance from any musician.<br /><br />Nevertheless it is a Kate Bush album and it would be uncharacteristic without a few indirect routes and quirky detours. The single \\"Wild Man\\" is the nearest here to her \\"traditional\\" style as she embarks on a Yeti hunt accompanied by Andy Fairweather Low. \\"Snowed in at Wheeler Street\\" is a duet with one of her heroes namely Sir Elton John. This reviewer is not a paid up member of his fan club but recognises the admirable soulful restraint he shows in the first part of this synth based song, although by the end it does feel overwrought and out of place. A rematch with Peter Gabriel might have been a better prospect for what is a great ballad on the brief encounters of two lovers over time? Finally the title track sees the ubiquitous Stephen Fry reciting 50 often made up words for snow over brilliant drumming by Steve Gadd and exhortations by Kate Bush with shouts of \\"come on man you got 44 to go\\". It is fun and Fry nicely downplays the linguistic gymnastics, but how often it will be played with the competitive draw of the big piano ballads on offer is another matter.<br /><br />Granted \\"50 words for snow\\" has imperfections. Those desiring the brevity of a \\"Under the Ivy' or \\"Man with the child in his eyes\\" may find the elongated piano soundscapes challenging and the album lacking colour. But you must persist since they reveal more on each listen; nuances like the guitar strummed at 4 minutes on \\"Snowflake\\" or the Joni Mitchell influenced piano work on \\"Lake Tahoe\\". Kate Bush has captured the pristine fragile quality of snow in the same way that Vivaldi on the Four Seasons somehow seized the drama of icy rain in the winter Concerto No. 4. It is her strongest album in years, one to be treasured both now and into the future and all we need to do next is follow the words of Sammy Cahn and exhort that \\"The lights are turned way down low, Let It Snow\\".ertheless it is a Kate Bush album and it would be uncharacteristic without a few indirect routes and quirky detours.

B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Been listening to this cd(as I type).  And I can say it's a really well produced cd.  I had thought drake fallen off and was going toward the lil' wayne route. But as other reviewers had stated he's going more towards his RNB vocals and also his usual rap style to complement his tracks.  If you haven't listened to this CD you should definitely check it out.  All his songs are really enjoyable to listen to.  So grab a lady/guy/lover/friend/party/acquaintance/stranger, and kickback get a drink or 2 or 3 and enjoy this album.  I can say it's a good CD to feel good to. Drake, keep coming out with CDs like these, and you will be in the spotlight for a long time. \\"Take care\\" my friends. And buy this CD. You won't regret it.

1451648537|5.0|This book is a true masterpiece. It gives the reader a very honest inside look at one of the greatest business leaders of our time. The author does a great job in balancing the greatness of Steve Jobs' business acumen and abilities while also being harsh on his personality and even his character. What we get is a very thorough look at Steve Jobs' life.   In addition, the author is extremely detailed with very extensive information about his life. At the same time, he doesn't let the story get too drawn out as many detailed authors do. More than reading about Jobs, I also enjoyed the authors style in writing this great book. I came out with some great new insights and information about Apple and Jobs while also enjoying the time I spent reading this long book.   At the end, I came out admiring Steve Jobs for all that he has contributed to the modern day world, while also recognizing that he is just as human as everybody else. And while he did achieve great things, he did have character flaws and relationship issues with important people around him, especially his family.   Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about a true business legend who is also a regular person just like everyone else. Don't worry, you will still have respect for Steve Jobs, the legendary innovator. His business legacy will live on forever.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The headphone has great sound, and it feels comfortable. I feel the sound clarity is very good, but it does lack bass. The sound doesn't compare to quality stereo systems, but for a headphone, it works well. I use the headphone for laptops and MP3 players. I can wear it for a long time, without feeling uncomfortable. Compared to other headphone I've used, this has the best sound quality. I use it all the time for both movies and music. If you prefer sound quality, I would recommend this headphone. If you prefer heavy bass, you might find this headphone inadequate.

1419702238|4.0|Greg is back and running from the law. When Greg and Rowley scheme up a plan to make some money for Christmas, their idea goes awry as usual, and school property is damaged. When a blizzard hits, Greg is stuck inside with his family but that's better than being hauled off to jail, right?  I enjoyed this book. Yes, some elements require the reader to imagine a little (like the family not noticing the neighbors having electricity), but what children's book doesn't?  I am a librarian at an elementary school, and I found the jokes about education hilarious. The kids were getting hurt on the playground equipment, so they removed each piece of equipment. When a kid got stuck, the teachers weren't allowed to touch a kid, so the parents had to come. They removed sugar drinks, so kids started selling them behind the school. It was also fun to see Manny grow up a little and become more of player in the storyline.   Fans of the series will enjoy this funny addition.

0812992792|5.0|I visited the 'truce village' at Panmunjom over 20 years ago, and it was easily the spookiest place I'd been then or since. We got to enter the negotiation building, and it's the one place where you get to step foot into North Korea itself.<br /><br />That spooky, ghostly feeling is captured impressively in \\"Orphan Master's Son.\\" In a sea of often derivative fiction, this stands alone as something I have never seen quite this way before. North Korea comes alive in an awful, painfully realistic way.<br /><br />We don't know exactly how realistic it is, but that doesn't entirely matter - it IS fiction, after all. The author does a good job of making his characters speak like real people; he doesn't use stilted dialogue, but remembers that people are people everywhere; informal conversations will probably sound like that all the time, whether it's the US or Korea. I was stationed in South Korea for a year, and the Korean soldiers I met were like the US soldiers - we all talked and acted pretty much the same way for a bunch of teenage guys.<br /><br />The book's \\"flaw,\\" is a confusing structure, and there are a variety of times where I thought it was not serving the story. But - when I got to the end, it all made sense. So you just have to bear with it. I think if you go into it expecting the structure to be a little awkward at times, that will help - it will all come together.<br /><br />Is it believable? Eh, probably not. I had to suspend disbelief a few times, but again, who cares? I DID care about the protagonist, and most of the characters he met along the way, even the bad guys. If there were times I didn't entirely buy the overall premise or the situation, that was okay.<br /><br />I gave this book five stars mostly because it is so imaginative and different. Needless to say, it's also well-written. I read a lot of books, and this is one of just a few where I actively looked forward to my reading time, simply because I was excited to see what would come next.

B005TZFZJC|5.0|Now I'm not a huge fan of Pop music BUT, Rihanna has grown on me over the years especially the Rated R album. This is probably my favorite. I love this album, she throws caution to the wind with a heavy induction of sexually charged songs even though her last album had S&M on it this one has that and MORE. Theres not one track that I don't like this album is very edgy, fun and down right sexy. I LOVE IT!!! Rihanna isn't holding back anything on this one.   My Favorite Songs are:  Cockiness  Talk that Talk   We Found Love  Roc Me Out  We All Want Love  Watch'N'Learn
0439023491|5.0|The ending is even more amazing. Although, the one thing I hate about the hunger games is that I always finish the book in a shorter time then I would like. I finished the first and second book in two days each. :/
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are great.  Sound is great, feel great on and are inexpensive.  I gave mine to my son because he likes them better than the ones he has that cost much more.  I just purchased another pair for myself.  You cannot go wrong with these!
B000FBFN0Q|3.0|Sigh! Yes, I finished it. Yes, I had fun reading it in general because of Sophie's writing. But the truth is, I found the heroine a horror. Everything about her rankled me and annoyed my sense of decency. A liar, a charlatan, a fraud, she never got over any of it, even in the end. How does someone like that rate? As much fun as I had reading this book because of Kinsella's style, I found the heroine someone I could never befriend on any level.  The thought of looking into someone check book out of curiosity left me not only uncomfortable, but disgusted. I felt she lost all respect and any redeeming qualities.  Unfortunately, I would not read the rest of the books. I love Kinsella's light-hearted writing but not this character.

B005HS00NW|4.0|Ahh yes, the everlasting rock n' roll romance of the double album. Most bloated, few worthwhile, all ambitious. When I think back to high school, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, the 1995 double album by The Smashing Pumpkins, comes to mind. When I think of college, it's Godspeed You Black Emperor's Lift Yr. Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven! and my late finding of Wilco's Being There. And then there's Ryan Adams' sprawling breakup record, Cold Roses, and what are easily three of my all-time favorite records - The Beatles' White Album, The Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St. and The Clash's London Calling. Now those seven double records, all of 'em, deserved their format. Most other double albums through time (not counting, you know, Bitches Brew, Bob Dylan, The Who and stuff like that)? Not the case. Nearly all of them, I'd argue, could be whittled down to a single album or even an EP. So when M83 main man Anthony Gonzalez announced last year that he was working on an \\"epic double album,\\" I started to worry. I'd only just become a big fan with the release of the last M83 album, 2008's great Saturdays = Youth, and now the guy was going to chase me off? Ugh.    Regardless, I skipped happily to the record store on release day, excited at the possibility of hearing a new classic for the first time. Anything to keep my going, and Gonzalez is, no doubt, an artist who seems capable of making the mod con classics. About halfway through the record's first proper song (and current single), \\"Midnight City,\\" I nearly wet my cargo shorts. What a huge, epic, inventive and addictive track! And, gulp, sexy! What is that hook? An animal? Animals? A final plea? Didn't matter, I was suddenly filled with the kind of excitement that's hard to find once you turn 30 - I thought for sure that I was in the middle of a new memory. One to keep forever and hold onto when the world is ugly, like the first time I heard White Blood Cells or OK Computer. Gonzalez had quickly made one thing clear: he had a whole lot of weird, ambitious ideas.    Then the record, titled Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, played on. Clearly, I realized, Gonzalez is still deeply obsessed with the sound of 80s pop music. That, and youth - the two themes prevalent throughout Saturdays. Luckily, he approaches neither from the slant of an ironic nostalgic, but, rather, as a cinematic nostalgic attempting to soundtrack both the daydreams of hip adults and the nighttime adventures of those still young enough to regularly indulge in such things. And he does so with lush, expansive arrangements, each of which holds tight to the record's cohesive sound while still managing to offer new ideas left and right. No doubt, Gonzalez took the Double Album Challenge because he knew he was at the peak of his powers. We hear that peak, absolutely, on tracks like \\"Wait,\\" \\"Midnight City\\" and \\"The Bright Flash\\" - and that's just the first disc! Big, fancy, extensively ornamented songs whose appeal just grows and grows with the familiarity of the listener.    And while this 80s space rock journey through dreams and childhood is most definitely a hell of an impressive piece of work, I'm not sure that the kind of music M83 make is conducive to the the double album format. I mean, yeah, Soft Machine made Third and Miles Davis made Bitches Brew and others have made double albums that aren't full of pop songs all through the history of recorded music. But, if I'm being completely honest, I do kinda/sorta feel like Hurry Up, We're Dreaming may have been better off as a single album. Rather than two 11-song discs that are just stuffed full of big ideas, how about the best 14 songs on one disc, followed by a really great seven-song EP? It'd be a classic, right? All the songs here are worth releasing, and I guess that's the point. When you're in the kind of zone Gonzalez is in, you kind of just want to brag about it and document it. You want to step up, and step past, the others. I get it - the drive of the human. On record.    Next topic: greatest triple albums of all time. Have One On Me, Sandinista and 69 Love Songs all come to mind. Hopefully Gonzalez doesn't take the challenge; in fact, despite the impressive accomplishment that is Hurry Up, he'd most definitely be better releasing single albums from here forward.

B004SDSSFY|5.0|I installed this the free version of this application on my Kindle Fire when I got the device immediately because I handles some complex Excel documents that I have. QuickOffice, the other office application that is available from the Amazon App Store and comes preloaded on the Kindle Fire, is very (and I mean very) slow with these large, complex documents. The full version of Documents To Go has a lot of features and works with all files that I have sent to it. For large documents, it can take a while to load, but the documents functions completely as expected on a mobile device, although some of the more complex formatting in Word documents can be simplified for mobile display. I don't think I would recommend Documents To Go for creating new documents, but for reading and making small modifications to existing documents, this application works 100% as advertised.

B005D9B26E|5.0|It seems that many of the reviews of this set are from people with no intention of buying it.  Which is, of course, their choice, but what they are doing, in essence, is reviewing the listed contents of the box, rather than the box itself.  I must admit, I was slightly disappointed to read that the bonus audio would consist entirely of demos, and that only part of the album would be available in 5.1.  Still, I ordered the box because, quite simply, this is an album I love.<br /><br />Having now played the contents of the box a couple of times over, and having read Pete's entire, lengthy liner notes, I can report that a mere list of the contents of this box do not do the box justice. Make no mistake about it--this is not a set where some minion within the Who organization put everything together and then sent it along to Pete's people for his approval.  Townshend wrote every word of the liner notes contained within this set--he writes not only of the genesis of the project, but the construction of the studio where it was recorded, the recording of and story behind his demos, and also of what he wanted to achieve with the album's narrative. Call him greedy, call him an egomaniac, or call him what you will, but it is obvious that Pete put a great deal of time and personal effort into this set. Is this an ego project for Pete? For crying out loud, he wrote every note of music and every lyric on this album--who better him to put together a package such as this?<br /><br />Included in this set is a rather extensive recording diary, along with access to a special web page where one can view the pages and original notations from the actual diary, as well as pictures from the sessions, many taken by Pete himself.<br /><br />I do want to add a couple of things, however:  First of all--the lack of studio outtakes.  The fact is, looking at the session diary, there doesn't seem to be much in the way of them--it would appear that only two songs were completed by the band that were not included on the final album--\\"We Close Tonight\\" (found on the 1998 \\"Odds & Sods) remaster) and \\"Four Faces\\" (which appeared on the 1979 \\"Quadrophenia\\" soundtrack).  So, for those complaining about the lack of any \\"new\\" studio material in this set, the problem is that there doesn't appear to be any.  Pete may well have been able to cobble together \\"alternate versions\\" from unused material, much like George Martin controversially did with the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" material in \\"Anthology 2\\", but he instead chose to put together an alternate version of the story using his demos.  He writes:<br /><br />\\"If I don't sequence my demos myself here, someone may attempt to do so. I put my hand on my heart to profess that I am not trying to fix the story by doing this, or make more sense of what might one day appear on the musical theatre stage...All of these demos have been included purely for enjoyment. I've had great fun working with them again (after 40 years in some cases)...Let's face it, if I was dead, a critic would write these liner notes and could posture all over my work as though they knew what they were talking about.\\"<br /><br />As for the lack of live material, Pete makes it clear that he is not proud of the subsequent tour the band undertook to promote the album.  In the liner notes, he describes how after spending the summer of 1973 recording the album, he then spent August 3 through September 12th mixing the album, whereupon Track announced that the album would be released October 13th and the tour would begin October 28th. His plans to take some time to not only prepare a quadraphonic mix of the album, but to properly mix backing tapes for the tour, and to spend some time with his family, were immediately cancelled. He writes:<br /><br />\\"What followed were some of the most shameful episodes in our career on stage...if only we had been given time to work together, The Who's Quadrophenia tour of 1974 might have been different. We were all depressed I think, anddisappointed...The Who's worn-out stage act had not been revitalized by Quadrophenia...\\"<br /><br />No, this set isn't for everybody.  But given the amount of material packed into this box--four discs of music, a DVD, a 45, an extensive hard-bound book plus access to a special website where one can peruse scores of documents, photographs and other material, as well as  about an hour of interviews with Pete, I can say that the set was worth every penny.italized by Quadrophenia...\\"  No, this set isn't for everybody.

B004FOA84A|1.0|I bought this for my grandson but it doesn't work on the Kindle Fire.  You can tap all day long and everywhere on the screen and you keep getting the same messages.  I found the key, but tapping on the frogs gets nothing.  My finger hurts.  There is no way to go back.  If you have two hours, perhaps you might figure it out.  The Kindle Fire might be the problem.  It is nothing like an I Pad.  It is very unresponsive.
1400069181|5.0|The book started off with a poem about success (often attributed to Elizabeth Anne Anderson Stanley), which at the time I was reading this book I wasn't quite feeling very successful. But the book and poem reminded me that there are many ways to define success. The book then starts telling the story of TOMS, which is a mix of things that as a huge TOMS fan I already knew, as well as information I didn't know before reading.  It's not just about TOMS. Blake also talked to others who \\"started something that matters\\" including the guys behind method, an eco friendly cleaning brand. I was fascinated to learn that beef fat is a common ingredient as a softening agent in dryer sheets.  It's an easy read, with the book split into different sections such as learning how to tell your story, facing your fears, which includes a great story about Blake's mom! There's also great advice like when Blake suggests reading biographies and that the timing is not going to ever be right. I thought it was a pretty quick read. Whether you just want to learn more about TOMS, want to make a difference, or want to learn how to do what you love, it's a good book to check out.
0307891402|5.0|I have used this book for over a week now, and all I can say is, \\"Wow, HOW did they do this?\\"  Yes, I've still had to Google some things, but this guide is simply amazing and I will try to do it justice with this review.  FORM:   - The size of this book is about 5-6 legal pads stacked together, but maybe 0.5\\" wider.    - One of the things that distinguish the Collector's Edition is a picture that wraps around the cover, front and back.  I really like the matte feeling of this cover and the pages inside.    - Yes, it does have very small type, probably the equivalent of an 8 or 9 Times New Roman type, but the paper is a nice thickness, so without the small type this book would have to ressemble my law school textbooks.  - It has TWO ribbon bookmarks.  Great idea as you really do need to tab more than one page at a time.   ORGANIZATION:   Personally I would have cried if I were faced with the task of organizing a comprehensive Skyrim guide in book form, so the folks at Prima really did an amazing job.  The book is divided into the following sections:  - Getting Started, which is more like a miscellaneous-overview section, as it includes Crafting, Horses, what happens when you commit crimes, and other general info.    - Bestiary, which lists all the mobs, and it has a section that lists the Items too.   - Quests (this section takes up the bulk of the book),   - Maps  - Appendices and Index.  The Quests section is organized by Type/Faction.  Let me explain what I mean.  The first section is the Main Quests section, divided into Act I, II, and III.  Then follows quests for The Companions, then the Winterhold people, then Thieves Guild, then the Dark Brotherhood, and so on, wrapping up with a Side Quests section.  At the beginning of each subsection, there's a checklist of all the quests in that subsection.  This checklist is handy for keeping track of what you have done as well as being a nice table of contents.  These are true walkthroughs!  Description of each quest will tell you all the important things that will happen during the quest.  It does NOT repeat the in-game quest description, but goes something like \\"Go here, talk to X, X will do Y, then you pick up [Quest Objective in Bold Type].\\"  If the quest area has optional stuff that might become important later, it will note that as well (the Glenmoril witches' heads come to mind)    My only gripe is that the quest names are not listed in the Index.  :(  Maybe that would make the Index too long?  I don't know.  But if you're trying to find a specific quest, it might take a bit of effort, and you'd have to know where you got the quest, like, is it just a side quest? Did the Dark Brotherhood give it to me?    The Maps section is also excellent.  Location names ARE listed in the Index, which is nice.  For each location you'd first get a map with numbered rooms, followed by sequenced notation of each number on the map.  For example, the city of Whiterun is #6.  So first you see a map of Whiterun, then you see 6.01 - The City Gate, followed by a short description and anything of interest (SKILLBOOKS!!!, unique gear, etc.) to be found there, then 6.02, 6.03, so on.    ACCURACY:   It's not 100% accurate, but pretty close.  Some items I find have small discrepancies between the Damage, Weight, and Value numbers in the actual game and in the guide.  There were also some typos, but these are few and far between.  I'm normally very nitpicky about these things, and they did not bother me in this book.  The quest walkthroughs were pretty much spot-on, so are the points of interests in the maps, so it got right all the things that actually matter.    One caveat is that if you're facing a difficult boss fight, the guide doesn't have very detailed information on fight strategy.  For those, I've had to look to the internet for help.  TL;DR: So much work went into this guide, and it shows!  It is extremely--and more importantly, ACCURATELY--detailed.  As well-organized as one can possibly expect from a non-digital (read: can't ctrl + f) guide of a game as mind-bogglingly huge as Skyrim.
B004EPYZSU|1.0|I'm very surprised at the positive reviews on here. I honestly thought the movie was pretty much everything wrong with the movie industry today. The name alone sounds like some hashed up SCI-FI B movie that should have went straight to VHS at best. To be fair though, I did watch the movie with hopes that it'll go against my ever nagging skepticism. To me I thought they should rename the movie Cowboys & [maybe SOME] Aliens because for almost half the movie, there were barely any encounters or rather I say quality scenes with the aliens and mind you, the aliens were your stereotypical bunch; sharp teeth, out to harm humans, ugly. Basically uncreative and definitely death to originality in every sense of the word. So half the movie felt like your typical cowboy movie and in the end, they have a small group of people that band together to fight the aliens in, mind you, a battle of very minute, nonepic, lackluster proportions. The movie wasn't suspenseful, it wasn't creative, it wasn't humorous, it wasn't witty, it just wasn't. Predictable from beginning to end.  So, what's so decent about this movie? Do I sense some mindless Harrison Ford worshipers or paid reviewers? I wouldn't watch this movie twice, so 23 bucks is definitely out of the question. To each their own, but you're giving the movie industry a bad message, basically \\"go ahead and make bad movies, chances are we're just [FILL IN THE BLANK WITH NEGATIVE WORDS] to tell and will probably pay to watch it anyway\\".   Amazon star ratings definitely should be held very loosely in terms of credibility. I hope everyone that gave this above 3 stars and above never become important people in real life, the future looks bleak.
0671027344|5.0|To put it in very simple terms...this book gave me the chills.<br /><br />The first time I read 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower', it was during my sophomore year at university and my friend pretty much had to force it down my throat. I don't remember much, except that I read it in one sitting, and later expressed my approval of it.<br /><br />It is now five years later, and it made me shudder. It made me think. It made me feel. It made me smile. It made me worry. It made me sad.<br />It made me very sad.<br /><br />I love the concept of the book, and I love the way it's been executed. The story is narrated by a teenager who goes by the alias of \\"Charlie\\". And the book is made up of various scenes in Charlie's life written through a series of letters to an anonymous person, whom he does not know personally. The story explores many serious topics and themes, such as introversion, rape, suicide, abuse, violence, abortion, drug use, sexuality and adolescence. As the story progresses, various works of literature and film are referenced and their meanings discussed through Charlie and his teacher, Bill, who gave him a series of books and movies to read and watch and then made him write reports on them.<br /><br />Some of these references include The Catcher in the Rye, The Fountainhead, Walden, To Kill a Mockingbird, A Separate Peace, Hamlet and much more. There were also a lot of musical references from Nirvana to the Beatles to Fleetwood Mac to Pink Floyd.<br /><br />But all of that, as interesting as it sounds, does not take away from the actual storyline or the characters portrayed in the book. Stephen Chbosky knew exactly what he was doing when he wrote this novel. He wrote it in a way that completely laid out the thoughts of this kid leaving him bare-naked (literally and figuratively), and succeeded in making him sound pathetic, yet intelligent, simultaneously.<br /><br />A lot of the times I was irritated with Charlie and his character in general. But then I thought about it and about why Chbosky would choose that specific tone of voice to portray a fifteen year old, and now that I've read it again, it occurred to me that Charlie is probably autistic. That's my theory anyway. His personality, his writing, the way he acts, and more importantly, reacts, his childlike behaviour, how overly emotionally he was - I mean, God, he cried over EVERYTHING. Obviously, he's a highly-functioning autistic, but autistic nonetheless, down to his brilliance, where near the end his teacher actually tells him that he is very \\"special\\".<br /><br />The ending still gives me goosebumps, as I remember the sadness, shock, grief, and deep love that engulfed me (as a reader) and Charlie (as a victim). This book will definitely remain a favourite, if for nothing else than a reference of great work by great people.tone of voice to portray a fifteen year old, and now that I've read it again, it occurred to me that Charlie is probably autistic.

B004G5VFOU|4.0|I bought this CD because I found that the opening chords of Glad kept popping into my head.  I own the LP but haven't played it for decades, because I no longer own an LP player.<br /><br />Listening to the music again after all this time brought back to me just how talented Traffic were and how understated their style of music was.  Where other bands would have been tempted to crash your ears with heavy guitars Traffic used flutes and subtle shifts in tempo to draw you slowly towards the climax of each song.<br /><br />The folk-influenced track John Barleycorn Must Die is the stand out for its understated gentility and just plain weirdness of its lyrics.<br /><br />As usual with these compilations the extra, \\"previously unreleased\\" tracks were previously unreleased for a very good reason.  But the live tracks, which were originally put together for a live LP that never got past the planning stage, are not a waste of money.
B003TML0VO|3.0|All you have to do is look at the list of tracks to see what went wrong: Photograph?  Smoke on the Water? Whole Lotta Love??  Not the right songs to showcase Carlos Santana's superb guitar playing.  And for the most part the guest vocalists are undistinguished.  There are a few great numbers and they are just the ones you would suspect:  While My Guitar Gently Weeps (not the greatest version of this song, but beautiful and distinctive); Little Wing (with Joe Cocker); Ain't Superstitious (fine homage to Jeff Beck).  Two songs that are definitely NOT known for their guitar work end up get surprisingly good treatment from Santana: Can't You Hear Me Knocking and Bang A Gong (Yes, T. Rex's Bang a Gong!).  But the rest of the album is the unsatisfying mishmash that other reviewers indicate.  Carlos Santana is one of the greatest and most recognizable guitarists of all time.  I'm sure he has a lot of great work ahead of him.
1400069181|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this book when I received it. I had always been inspired by the TOMS shoes story and hope that someday I can be a part of something similar. This book provided insight into both:  Blake walks you through the beginning stages of TOMS-- From a quick idea for how to help children in argentina and 250 shoes, to a full fledged business with a team of people around him. If the idea behind TOMS resonates with you, this book will most likely find you well.   As an entrepreneurial individual, I also loved the practical ways in which a social cause can be weaved into business ideas.  I enjoyed it, I hope you do as well!
B004ZQRFGM|4.0|I bought this based on the reviews and I was not disappointed.  Popovic has a strong voice and good compositional talents.  Best of all, she's a hot guitarist.  Not quite the pyrotechnics of SRV or of contemporary players like Tinsley Ellis and Sean Chambers, but still strong and inventive solos with real teeth to them.  There's a great cover of the jazz classic, \\"Work Song,\\" and some good original tunes.
B004P8JPS6|1.0|I've been a big fan of the Reacher series, but this one is a big turkey just in time for the holidays.  The plot has more holes than a five-pound block of Swiss cheese. It appears Mr Child has simply run out of good ideas for Reacher novels.  What a shame.

1451627289|5.0|A portal.  A butterfly's wing.  The past is something which can twist and turn like an elastic band.  One twitch and the whole band will convert itself to a entirely new formula.  The President's death and an unjust, unrelated murder intertwine in the new Stephen King novel \\"11/23/63\\".  This is a page-turner in the tradition of our beloved \\"original\\" Stephen King - before he began to churn out messy excuses for potential movie productions.  You might think that another \\"portal\\" book is, well, just another portal book.  \\"11/23/63\\" will surprise you with originality and astound you with an entirely new appreciation for King's works.  My only real concern at this point is that someone will go back in time and possibly change this book.  I hope not.  I like it just the way it is.  \\"11/23/63\\" is a great pick.  Take your time and read every word.  You won't be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you are, then maybe we can travel back in time and change that.  Densel Myers  Yukon, Oklahoma

1932100385|5.0|Like many of the reviews I have read, I too have an education in health, science and medicine dating back some 50 years...but this book dispelled a lot of what I had believed. I watched the Forks over Knives movie first (on NetFlix), and then started buying and reading all of the various cookbooks related to the video. I figured I had already seen the movie, why read the `China Study\\" book? Boy, was I wrong...the book breaks it all down step-by-step. What we need to do to get healthy, and who is out there trying to protect their profits at our expense (in both health and money).   Last night I watched the TV series \\"The Good Wife\\", and wouldn't you know it...the firm was fighting a lawsuit to protect the old established food pyramid used in our schools...making jokes about the so-called `vegetable lobby'. Kind of got my `dander' up.  I am 75, and been a kind of border-line vegetarian for years...but always got my olive oil, milk and eggs, and the occasional steak or fish `for my health'.  Now I have been on a strict vegan diet for about a month, and I can really feel the difference. I'm also off of most of the supplements I was taking, and working to get off of the rest of my medications.  I do my best to try and encourage others to read the `China Study' book for their own good health...and their family, but too often their eyes just glaze over when I try to explain the health advantages of a plant based whole food diet. But some have promised to read the book and let me know their thoughts. If we all do that then maybe we can make a difference.
B006470HZ6|3.0|*Spoilers Ahead*   I really cant help but compare this season to the breathtaking and phenomenal season one. Whereas in Season 1 I felt that I had to suspend disbelief only minimally, I see myself having to do that now a lot. Some have already mentioned some of the inconsistencies that have overall contributed to diminishing the quality of the show.   One of course is the whole trying to pull the zombie out of the well thing. I mean first, Dale stops the other dude from drinking the water, saying it is contaminated when he finds out the zombie is in there. Then, they risk someone's life, i.e. Glenn's, to take the zombie out on grounds that leaving it there might contaminate the water? Also, while on the one hand they argue with each other about not taking unnecessary risks, here they are willing to risk one of their best men to take out a zombie that had already contaminated the well so it doesnt contaminate the well? It didnt make sense. It seemed to me that the well zombie segment was inserted in there more as a show of a cool zombie effect rather than because it really fit the story. It is as if they wanted that gory special in there and wrote the story around it.   And what is that with the church scene? I dont remember if it was in this episode or the previous one but it was one thing that truly bothered me: that whole scene where first Carol and then Grimes sit there and whine and plead, pray and sob to the cross was so sappy and tacky. Oh my god. I couldnt believe they blew so much screen time on that. I mean let's forget for a second that you would have to be seriously insane and in complete and utter denial to believe in any kind of religious stuff or divine providence when the freaking ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE has befallen the Earth, but to seriously make that one of the plot elements with the secret message being that maybe there is something divine after all, was so inappropriate for this show, not to mention sappy.   And whats up with the men all holding the weapons and determining which little woman can keep hers. That's ridiculous. They keep saying they cant have it because they have no training, but who cares? The world has come to an end for cryin' out loud;  these people live life like someone was holding a knife to their throats and they are at the risk of being attacked by an insane freak at any moment. Everyone, except the kids, needs to carry a gun and not ask for permission, especially when they are wandering through the woods filled with zombies. And then even that is obviously biased, because Lori got to have one last episode because she is Rick's wife even though she is as trained in shooting as Andrea or Carol.   Another thing that truly bothered me is how careless these people are. This is a world that has gone under and the deranged undead are lurking in every corner, and neither Lori or Carol really watch for their kids. In the first episode of the season when they were stranded on the road blocked with cars, they just wander amid the cars and Lori and Carol let the kids walk around on their own. Later when they go looking for Sophia, Carl asks if he can go stating that \\"they need all the men they can get to cover as much ground as possible\\". Yes, kid, all the MEN, not little boys. And then Lori actually says \\"I dont know. Ask your dad, I cant always be the bad guy\\" as if she was debating whether she should let her kid go to Magic Mountain instead of on a zombie hunt:  for crissake by_ch you are about to send your kid out into woods deluged by the insane undead, he isnt going to the state fair or planning to go on throw up rides. I couldnt believe they let him go. So of course when he was shot, it was hard ot feel sympathy for them -they should never have let the kid go.   Everything since they left the CDC is drawn out. I think this is all supposed to be taking place in a 48 hour period but it is so drawn out that it feels like they have been there for a week. I know they are waiting for Carl to get better too but their main mission still seems to be to find the girl and at this point it seems just a little crazy and out of touch with reality for them to be looking for a girl abandoned in the woods filled with zombies. Do they seriously think they are actually going to find her. ?  Anyway these are just a few of the inconsistencies that are starting to really bug me. Otherwise great show - even though I wish they were bringing back more of the bleakness of the first season and stopped with all the sentimentalities and sappy sub-plots.

1416955070|1.0|I somehow managed to find this book on my bookshelf and thought the premise sounded very interesting. People had there complaints about how similar to Harry Potter it was, but I figured I'd give it a go. And I was very sad.   I had to force myself to get 100 pages in. It was painful. I really wanted to like this book, but between the awkward sentences, weird wording, and poor characterization I had to give it up. Like I said, I wanted to like this. The ideas of this book sounded like it was just up my alley...but the execution failed in my mind. Overall, it was poorly written.

0307938905|5.0|The audio version of this book is read by Jim Dale (who has also read the Harry Potter series). He has a great voice, especially for a novel like this. He gives each character their own voices and his narration is beautiful.  The novel itself is amazing. I just finished the audiobook and I loved it so much I'm buying the hardcover as well. It was a story of magic and a little bit of mystery and romance sprinkled in. There were so many exciting and animated characters that you just can't help but fall in love with them.   This is not a book I'd recommend listening to while working around the house or doing anything really. It's great for long drives and quiet time by yourself. There are so many details and the dates are important, so you should really pay attention. :)

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I'm not using this amplifier for the same reasons as most of the other reviewers. I needed this so that I would be able to connect my TV headphones up to my Xbox 360. My tv doesn't have rca audio out support, so I couldn't connect them directly to the TV and when I connected them directly to my Xbox, the sound output was far too quiet. Simply put, this mini amp saved me from having to hear my wife tell me to turn the volume down while she sleeps. I can now listen to my games and movies when I like and as loud as I like.

B004LWZW24|3.0|Surprisingly 'old-school' ghost story given that the writer and director are best known for their work on the hardcore Saw films. If it weren't for the last twenty minutes and the subsequent, exhausted 'twist' ending, this would be a really solid film.<br /><br />Young Dalton Lambert goes into a medically inexplicable coma. His family searches for answers. Weird things happen. A psychic is consulted. More weird things happen. That's the movie with the major twists and revelations unrevealed.<br /><br />Wan and Whannel get a lot of productive mileage out of showing little and suggesting a lot, of quick scares and odd things lurking in the outskirts of the frame. The cosmology introduced by the psychic to explain what's going on makes a certain amount of sense, though it's not developed enough to be all that convincing for long. A visual homage to Neil Gaiman's Sandman series is a bit jarring; that one supernatural entity looks an awful lot like Darth Maul undercuts a certain amount of tension.<br /><br />Rose Byrne is a stand-out as the worried mother. Byrne's face in repose tends to look sad anyway -- I think it's her eyebrows -- and the look suits the material. Patrick Wilson is fine as the father, who has supernatural secrets of his own, though he appears to lose about 50 IQ points in the last twenty minutes. When the psychic tells you not to draw attention to yourself, don't run around yelling at every supernatural entity you encounter, that's all I've got to say.<br /><br />The movie also joins the horror sub-sub-sub-genre of 'Monsters who love novelty songs,' as one entity really likes Tiny Tim's \\"Tiptoe Through the Tulips,\\" which was already terrifying enough on its own. Hell's playlist must be really awful.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|I loved the free version of this game so I decided to buy the full version. But this has the same features as the free one. I was very dissapointed when I found out that this game had even less blades that you could unlock. So I say stick w/ the free one.
B005I6EVUG|2.0|This is a beautiful, sturdy-looking case -- but contrary to what the manufacturer claims, this does NOT fit the Kindle Fire. I was able to slide the device into the corner rubber bands (a tight fit, but possible) but the case doesn't close; the magnet on the top cover has nothing to hold to, and the case just sits partway open. Such a shame, but for this price it should fit perfectly. Back it goes.  UPDATED TO ADD: If you are looking for a slim, book-like case, I ended up going with a case that isn't available on Amazon, but was purchased from my local Best Buy - the M-Edge Incline Jacket (also considered the Belkin Verve Folio without a tab).
B005TZFYNE|5.0|Went and picked this album up at midnight, I guess I can't stand to wait. Anyways, I did some research before I got it and it didn't get the best reviews, but Rihanna has  never disappointed in my eyes, and I have no problems with any of her albums. Well, the negative naysayers must not of been speaking about the album I bought because it is fantastic. Thus it may be my favorite album so far from Rihanna. The only song that I was confused about and kind of mad about was \\"Birthday Cake\\", which would have  easily been one of my favorite songs on the album, if it was an actual song, but it ends up going black like the final episode of the Sopranos not even half way through.  All in all I love this album, it is fresh and up-beat with some Dubstep thrown in the mix. Perfect to brighten ANY mood and definitely going to be picked clean by Radio Stations and the Hot 100 like all of Rihanna's albums have been. Peace

0062112430|2.0|I really don't understand the hype.<br />This was just your typical YA dystopian novel: girl likes boy at first glance and of course the guy likes the girl too, and they fall in love despite the world around them being against it. Ick. This was just too slow and boring for me. The idea behind love being a disease that the government needs to \\"cure\\" you for is just so bizarre. I read this thinking it could be either awesome and unique or just a big boring mess. About 100 pages in I realized it was the latter. It was just extremely slow and dragged on forever; it was like trudging through a big muddy hole. You would think that with how slow it was there would be some kind of slow but sweet development in their romance, but of course there wasn't. I just couldn't understand the attraction.<br /><br />I had a hard time reading this one, I found myself taking frequent breaks and getting frustrated at the pace and lack of character development. It was predictable and did I mention boring? The first half of the book built you up on understanding Lena. I get that she's afraid to fall in love because of what happened to her mom, but the whole idea of having an operation to remove love is just a bit too farfetched for me. Lena was boring and I had a hard time connecting to her. I felt like most of the characters in this book were never really developed and were mostly just flat. I really like Oliver's writing style but the pacing was awful, and I never really understood the love interest. I got tired of the constant make-out and exploration scenes with them and just wanted some action. Lena and Alex spend most of the book making out, and lying to their families. I just couldn't really see the interest in Alex. The characters were just a bit to angsty and flat for me.<br /><br />Despite all of the negative, there were a few good aspects to the book as well. Lauren Oliver is a master of description. I really loved the openers at the beginning of each chapter. Oliver quotes books, songs, and essays that she made up to give you an understanding of the way the people in her world thought. I felt like that really added to the story and loved that she did that.<br /><br />Overall I didn't hate this book but I didn't like it either. It just didn't hit it for me. If you like your dystopia with a whole lot of romance and only a teeny bit of action then this is the book for you. It just wasn't really my cup of tea.that she made up to give you an understanding of the way the people in her world thought.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|As Brad Pitt might exclaim, \\"Is this what you've been waiting for?\\" Well, is it? No, not really. I have thoroughly come to enjoy the Song of Ice and Fire series, but this book follows the trend of the last novel in its inclusion of superfluous narratives and wandering plot lines. I really love some of this book, but I don't love enough of it to justify the parts I feel are wholly unnecessary. When I pick up a book this size and commit many hours of personal time to turn its pages, I want the parts to add up to a cohesive whole. This book, alas, is not as cohesive as the first three novels that got me here. We have two more shots, let's hope two years from now when the next book comes out we will have something to really talk about. And by the way, Winter has been coming for a hell of a long time, when will it finally get here?
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This is one of my favorite modern watches.  Unfortunately, I don't wear or wind this watch every day so I can't comment on it's ability to keep perfect time.  But it's a nice looking watch, not too out there but not too conservative.  I like the black face/background.  The size won't overwhelm small wrists and it's not super thick, either.  I'm right handed and always wear watches on my right wrist, so they see a lot of action.  I have yet to put a scratch or a nick in the edge of the the crystal.  I really like the matte casing; nothing to chip here and it masks scratches.  My watch still looks new.  If you like automatic watches, this is a good choice for an every day watch.  Personally, I'm a fan of the 70s quartz Seiko; this is pretty much the only modern watch I'll wear.

1451627289|3.0|I have been an avid King fan from the 70's I have not missed a book. To me, the Dark Tower series is without a doubt the best serials ever written. IT and The Stand are great and I have read them 3 times. I have been disappointed in the last 10-15 years of Kings average writing. Maybe if he quit with the politiccing and focused on character development and story line, he can get his mogo back.<br /><br />11-22 is a good read but barely so. I have noticed some similarities in the characters from past books. The time travel ability is a great device that isn't used to its maximum. I am afraid Stephen is still sleepwalking. My advice, not that he will take it: WAKE UP!
B0046IGOIO|5.0|Yea this is an audience recording with not the best quality, but you can hear everything well, and most importantly balanced.  The real importance is in the performance. This is probably one of my favorite Doors shows ever. They show the blues and psychedelic style. Morrison sang incredibly well, very organized and belted his voice ( especially in the blues section). Basically Morrison's talent as a singer is very present in this recording.  As for the band, great as always. Great instrumentals, perfect timing and consistent drive.  They cover all the classics like light my fire, and even The End (ggreeat version I might add).  The Blues Section was just as awesome, and a pleasure to hear. Albert King's guitar blended sooo well with the whole band. They seem to have had prior practice because everything was played on the spot and it worked out so well. This is towards the end of The Doors (with Jim Morrison) and yet I think Morrison sounded arguably better than ever. All in all, great great show. The only downside is that its an audience recording, but it is very very listenable.
0446573019|2.0|People have already commented on the similarities of Puller to Reacher. Reacher's story is much more 'alive' and compelling. Puller seemed one dimentional and monotone. Obviously Baldacci doesn't know small towns. Puller and Cole could not have gone un-noticed like they did in the story. Plus the military would not get into this 'doomsday' scenario and then leave it to just one man to fix. And the story with his brother in prison was contrived at best.<br /><br />What is it with my favorite authors seeming to sleep walk through their work? If you are absolutely desperate for a read, choose this. If not, save it for last.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Shipping was very quick for this item. When I received it, I was a little taken aback by how plastic and toy-like it looked. (I think, in my fannish excitement, I expected a real sonic screwdriver.) It's important to remember that this item reflects the price- it does not look super realistic. But upon opening it, all my worries melted away. It's a ridiculously fun prop for a Whovian to have. Very worth it.
B004N6369Y|2.0|I wish I read the reviews on this book before I read it.  Like many other readers, I have read all of Danielle Steels books & just purchase them when they come out without reading any reviews.  This book was terrible. It was very boring. The characters were unbelievable and it just went on and on about they love each other and how important the hotel was.  I don't believe it should take 3/4 of a book to tell that.  Finally, at the end it had a little bit of a plot but still not up to what I am used to in Danielle Steel books.  It really did not even seem as though she wrote the book.  I used to eagerly look forward to her books coming out but if this book is what I have to look forward to I will not be wasting my money.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|Rihanna's 6th studio album comes 1 year and 5 days after her last \\"LOUD\\" and for a normal artist that may seem a bit rushed, but not for rihanna! she gives us quality songs! and she has really outdone herself with TALK THAT TALK! the deluxe package includes, a poster a photo booklet, a FREE sample of her newest perfume \\"Rebelle\\" and of course the album itself, featuring 4 more songs than the standard edition of the album, if you are looking for good quality music, then look no further \\"TALK THAT TALK\\" is a masterpiece.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book is superbly written, and makes you feel that you were there.  You also learn, finally, what was behind the scenes of so  many, many events.  Steve Jobs comes across as not a very nice man, but a passionate one, and one for whom we should be grateful existed.  After reading this book, I would never have wanted to work for the man, be married to him or be in his family.  Too much durm und strang.  But I am so glad he was on this earth and contributed mightily to our lives.  The book makes the point that Jobs was the first major person who prioritized aesthetics and the user experience in creating technology products.  And believed that aesthetics is crucial to the use and acceptance of any product.  Indeed, he did create a hit parade.  The book is a must read for anyone with even a passing interest in how we got to where we are in this digital age.

B0041KKYH4|5.0|I was surprised to see all the bad and mixed reviews on this film, as I thought it was hilarious. The writing is smart, and the cast does a great job with it. I think this was one of my favorite parts for Cameron Diaz - she plays 'bad' well, and seemed to be having a great time with this one. She and Justin Timberlake were a riot together, and Lucy Punch and Jason Segel are great in their supporting roles. There are a lot of raunchy moments, but it's not the main humor of the movie - a lot of the humor is zinger insults between Lucy Punch and Cameron Diaz, and they are quite good at it. I didn't find the characters as unlikable as some - they are hard-edged, but not whiny, so I can take that. So overall, if you're looking for a funny, medium-brow comedy, this is a good choice.

B004JHY8A8|2.0|This book holds a wonderful idea for a novel - unfortunately it is not remotely realised. The story of the child locked in a cupboard while his family are taken away by the French police in occupied France and the subsequent story of his sister's journey is a fantastic premise for a novel . Unfortunately the majority of the book evolves into glorified chic lit and not even well written chick lit at that. The dreadful juxtaposition of a middle aged woman's shallow love life is a horrific affront to the harrowing story of occupied France. The modern day story of the women's life rivals the tedium of of Eat, Pray, Love with a sprinkle of Holocaust Tragedy to add needed gravity.<br /><br />There are so, so many worthy, well written stories of the war period - this is not one of them. It left me untouched, annoyed and bored. Try the Book Thief, Stones from the River, or Alone in Berlin instead for a gripping and moving read.
0345505387|1.0|I don't care for the graphic novel, the illustrations look too \\"cartoonish\\", again, like I've heard several people say, not their idea of what Jamie & Claire should look like. I think Claire would resemble more of an old \\"Brenda Starr\\" cartoon with darker hair. Diana seems wrapped up in this \\"Lord John\\" character more and more and I don't like him or the story when it revolves around him. I have gotten several of the books that revolve around him and they just could not keep me interested in more than 40 pages. The interaction between Jamie & Clare is awesome and enjoyable to read. They are two very intelligent people with very different and distinct skills and are constantly involved with life and the obstacles thrown in their path.
B002WCLG3O|3.0|Ok, I am not a gamer , I don't play them anymore. SO this was just a story about  future soldiers and it was 8 stories put together into one movie.

Which is what I got so I can't complain to much.

They also love the hot chocolate scene on the train!  haha  This is a fantastic family film!  Put on your warm, snuggly pajamas...make some hot chocolate with mini marshmallows...gather your family around you and enjoy the movie!
0446573019|4.0|OK, this is a plain ol' rip off of a Lee Child novel, but that is what makes it so good. The intrepid Army MP officer who is tall, rugged, and a loner goes after the bad guys with the help of the local female sheriff. Stop me if you've read this plot before, say in a couple of Jack Reacher novels by Lee Child. It was not a stay-up-all-night book like most of Lee Child's are, but it was close. The book refuses to end, though. It just keeps going. OK, alright, we get it. Please stop. And for that I deducted a star. I also deducted the same star because Mr Baldacci has the annoying habit of writing \\"boots on the ground\\", \\"wheels\\" (for cars), and \\"wings\\" (for airplanes). It is almost child-like (gawd, do I love the pun!) in his repetitive use of these trite phrases. Please stop that also.<br /><br />About halfway through it, I thought he was going to duplicate the plot from his Wish You Well book, but he did deviate nicely. I could feel the coal grit on the pages of the book. BTW, Wish You Well is a good book, though different genre from this one.<br /><br />Other than these minor gripes, it was a good read. Go ahead and buy it.

1400069181|4.0|My name is Jeremy Willet, and I am the co-founder and director at The Hunger Strike. As a new organization, we were anticipating Blake's new book because we were supporters of his business model, product, and advocacy on behalf of the poor. TOMS was being introduced around the same time that we were developing our organization, so we could relate to many of his stories in the book. Fulfilling online orders around a kitchen table in \\"the office\\", sleeping on floors of host homes because of no budget for a hotel room, flying to international countries to meet with partners, and always attempting to present a professional representation of the organization even though everything wasn't completely established. The TOMS model is \\"one-for-one\\" and every time a shoe is bought, TOMS provides one for a child in need. Recently, they have expanded into eyewear, providing glasses for children in poverty, and even his book provides reading material for children without education for every book purchased! This business model is truly revolutionary, and one that has been used by many successful businesses and non-profits ever since.<br /><br />Blake tells the remarkable story of how TOMS came into existence after a trip to Argentina, sharing honest fears, mistakes, and successes. He encourages others to \\"face their fears\\", to \\"be resourceful without resources\\", and to \\"give\\". He provides a detailed list of free resources for any new business or organization to find online to help launch ideas that matter.<br /><br />We appreciated Blake's honesty in the book, and the steps he provides for growth in any business, organization, or non-profit. Unfortunately, one major point he left out was his faith in Jesus. We have heard that Blake is a follower of Jesus, however, he has always worked hard to keep TOMS from becoming a \\"Christian organization\\". As a follower of Christ myself, I completely understand his reasoning for keeping TOMS a \\"for-profit/non-religious\\" business because it makes the product more accessible, and ultimately, gives more shoes to children in need. From a business standpoint, this always made sense to me, so I was looking forward to a book where Blake could be a bit more \\"personal\\", and was hoping that he would give glory to God for his success. Unfortunately, he never does.<br /><br />If Blake truly is a follower of Jesus, then he missed a major opportunity to tell the story of a God that didn't give \\"one-for-one\\", but rather, \\"one-for-all\\".<br /><br />Jesus.<br /><br />God's very own son, given to death on a cross for the sins of the world. (See John 3:16)<br /><br />The information shared in the book is highly inspirational for anyone that wants to \\"Start something that matters\\", but in order for something to have a lasting impact for generations to come, it must be built on a foundation that won't be shaken by inflation, currency, or economic downturns. It appears that Blake's original motivation to start TOMS and impact children in Argentina came from his faith in Christ, and if so, then he should have shared that! Blake shares a lot about \\"facing your fears\\" and \\"taking risks\\", and my recommendation to him would be to take the risk of being open about his faith, even at the cost of losing his whole business.<br /><br />We are thankful for TOMS being an advocate for the poor around the world, providing basic physical items to children in need. We also appreciate Blake's vision, honesty, and transparency, and pray that he would be quick to give Jesus the glory for his success. We believe that in doing so, TOMS will be around for a long time...<br /><br />Jeremy Willet, Co-founder & Director of The Hunger Strikeccessible, and ultimately, gives more shoes to children in need.

0439023483|5.0|It takes a lot to keep my 11 year old son's attention long enough to finish a book in one months time.  He just could not stop reading and I was so surprised that I had to check it out myself. I finished it in a couple of days it was that good!  I love the fact that the protagonist is a strong girl and that she is not perfect! The plot catches you from page one and the suspense just keeps you hooked until the last page.  It does have violence, romance and a certain social criticism that I think is very valuable even if it is just a fiction book. It does invite reflection in a young mind as much as in a grown up.
B005AUWY90|3.0|The top three rated reviews had really good points that I agreed with; here's my take.  The movie is visually stunning. I watched some special features ahead of time and learned about some of the graphical upgrades they made in this movie (over the first movie) and, as I watched the film, kept my eye open for the elements they discussed. It was a treat to look at. And it's true that they did an amazing job car-ify-ing the world - watching for all the subtle changes was a treat in itself.  As for the plot, well.... I'm not the kind of person that has to have unplumbed depth and intelligence in the movies I watch. Sometimes, you just want some fun. I felt that the plot of this movie is Good Enough; good enough to carry me through it without being totally bored, had everything tied together, and so on.  But I was watching it with my then-three year old son. He loved watching the original Cars movie, in which the scariest parts of the show were the gang of hooligans lulling Mack to sleep and then waking him up, and the 20-second clip of a combine chasing Mater & Lightning in a field. The meanest character was Chick Hicks, and his bad attitude was clearly condemned in the plot. The whole framework of the story was easily understandable by a 3yo, even if individual actions went over his head.  Because he loved the first movie so much, Cars 2 was the first movie we ever took him to see in the theater.   My son enjoyed the pratfalls even when he didn't \\"get it\\" (ie, Mater eating wasabi), and he enjoyed the car races and the fancy gadgets found throughout the movie. The question he asked the most, over and over, was \\"Why did he do that?\\" and \\"Why did he want to do that?\\"  But Cars 2 is a spy film. There are bad guy cars who actually KILL other cars. My son didn't even know what a bomb WAS until this movie. Even after explaining it, he still can barely grasp the concept of alternative fuel, and certainly not \\"alternative fuel that can be easily ignited\\", let alone the conceptthat someone would purposely sabotage someone else. And the idea of introducing something dangerous so that consumers would be hurt and then driven to purchase the safer option, thus making the villian rich? My kid is barely old enough to understand the explanation of what a lie is, let alone this complex plot of lies layered on lies. And for what - to gain money? Again, even at 4, he still doesn't have a firm enough understanding of money to realize that some people lust after it enough to hurt others for it.  There were many other parts of the movie that we had to explain:   -Mater dressing up as another truck, so seamlessly that you couldn't see it was still Mater.   -Voice \\"signature\\" activation on the bomb (ie why only one person's voice would work)  -The inside of Big Bentley (sorry dudes, maybe we're uncultured swine, but he was only 3, we haven't had The Talk yet about what clocks look like inside and the fact that there's a really big clock in this one city we've never been to) and what it meant that the gears were going around (ie \\"if those gears keep moving, Holley and Finn might get squished\\")  And others that used up screen time but went right over his head and we didn't bother to explain:  -Why it was a problem that Francesco said he was faster than Lightning  -That all the bad cars were jealous of \\"normal\\" cars (because the bad ones were lemons and nobody likes them)  -Everything to do with IDing the bad guy:  ---The kind of engine he used  ---The kind of nuts/bolts for that engine  ---Buying special parts for a particular engine  ---What's a \\"lemon\\" engine  ---Oil leaks  I could probably put another page-scroll worth of stuff, but I only saw the movie once and can't remember it all without googling it. The point is, your 3-, 4-, and possibly even 5-year-old is probably NOT going to understand MOST of what happened. You might as well put it on in another language, or on mute, because 75% of the dialogue and half the actions are just going to go rightover their head no matter what. There are just so many things they haven't had to experience or learn about, and at the younger age, possibly not capable of understanding, even if they're really intelligent - some sorts of reasoning just don't blossom until kids are a little older (6, 7, 8 years old).  I still haven't decided whether I'll be getting the DVD for myself, because if it's in the house, I know he'll ask to see it. I realize this sounds as if I (and my son) didn't like the movie, and that's not true. Even completely \\"not getting it\\", he's totally enamored of the thing. But if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have taken him - I'd have just seen it by myself, and let him wait another 3-4 years.

But, now I have a Kindle Fire...and I'm not sure how to get my Touchdown key that I've already purchased over to it, without buying it again on Amazon.  So, I tried K-9 Mail.  Evidently, it isn't possible to have K-9 Mail do Exchange with a Zimbra server....  Second problem...can't open any of the attachments I receive in K-9 on the Kindle Fire (most attachments will work from the stock email app, the rest could be opened after saving them.)  Hopefully there'll be resolutions to these issues.

B005NF2UE6|4.0|Nickelback return with another strong album that combines their trademarks of big guitars with massive vocal hooks into another set of memorable songs that guarantees them lots of commercial radio play. This time round the band decided to produce the album themselves and they have done a great job after working with the legendary rock producer Mutt Lange on their previous album Dark Horse. It might not be quite as shiny as Dark Horse but the production on Here & Now is still absolutely huge with lots of great big guitar tones, awesome backing vocal arrangements, and a nice solid drum sound. Highlights include the frantic riffs of the killer opening track \\"This Means War\\", the massive party anthem \\"Bottoms Up\\", the rocking grooves of \\"Gotta Get Me Some\\", the epic power ballad \\"Lullaby\\" which has some really nice piano parts, and the heartfelt sentiment of \\"Trying Not To Love You\\". If you're a fan of what Nickelback do then you will love this album. If you are yet to warm to their style of catchy commercial rock then you might want to avoid Here & Now because it offers more of the same.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|The ultra-violet *digital* copy is fraught with problems. I had planned on keeping the digital copy of this film on my Kindle Fire locally for a plane flight I had. Talk about a pipe dream. I couldn't even get the copy to play on a 10 month old laptop running XP, all updates, inside the Flixter application with the Flixter and Ultra-Violet accounts confirmed as operational (yes, you need both). During my support chat with a Flixster rep I was told to uninstall and re-install Flixster as the first troubleshooting step and without any information given other than my email address, what movie I was working with and what platform I was on. The rep, David, asked me three (3)! times what type of internet connection I had. Surprise, surprise it never worked on that laptop either. Save yourself USD5 and just get the blu-ray or regular DVD depending on your taste - the ultra-violet digital copy is a waste of money and time spent trying to make it viewable. I wont ever buy another ultra-violet digital copy. Nor would I use Flixster for anything media related.<br /><br />EDIT - adding a comment I posted to someone complaining about all the one-star reviews being *invalid* because I think it's germane to my point:<br /><br />\\"There are plenty of instances where AMZN users will unfairly criticize a product because it was shipped late, it arrived damaged or for some other clearly invalid reason - I hate that. This is not one of those situations. To say that anyone who gave the product one star because of the hideous and unusable ultra-violet digital copy is wrong in doing so, is off-base. The digital copy is key to the purchase for many people - it costs USD5 more because of its inclusion. If anything it might serve as a call to have AMZN sequester the groups of reviews from one another (blu-ray vs blu-ray + digital etc...) - in the meantime, it's perfectly just to post a well thought out, negative review because of that poor digital copy.<br /><br />By your logic, all three copies of the film (Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital) as sent by AMZN could be non-functioning on a massive scale (as is the case with the ultra-violet copy), but everyone would still be obliged to leave a favorable review because the movie was really entertaining when you saw it in the theater? It doesn't make any sense.\\"nd Digital) as sent by AMZN could be non-functioning on a massive scale (as is the case with the ultra-violet copy), but everyone would still be obliged to leave a favorable review because the movie was really entertaining when you saw it in the theater?

The whole idea behind getting a digital copy is that you own it and can watch it in places without internet access like an airplane on your portable device. Why do we have to stream a video we've supposedly purchased the rights to own? Sorry WB. It's too late for backsies on this one!

B00003CWPR|4.0|This film is very much about sex, but it is presented in a number of ways. Opposites and confusion abound and poor Tom Cruise (Dr. Bill) gets very lost. Nicole Kidman starts off the flick by undressing and we get the full back side view. Not bad at all for starters. Kubrick is playing Ingmar Bergman in this film a little more than he is competent to do. But then,everything is for sale, if you can't get it for nothing. But there's always a catch.<br /><br />Kubrick's handling of this reality is special. He excells at exploiting the amazing power of film to depict pure evil and the scene at the masquerade orgy is very scary. The music is very scary too, very much in line with Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda film about the Nazis. The eery high note on the piano that pierces the air frequently is stolen from Bergman though - same tension, probably the same note.  Actually I just listened to a George Winston piece in one of his season albums and that's the song - like Beethoven's Ninth Symphony appearance  in Clockwork Orange.  anywho, The director leaves you to judge for yourself. Leni guilty, Stanley innocent? What about Bergman? To be fair, Stanley and Ingmar had the luxury of  hindsight, which has evil always in its gunsights, but now freed from any real moral responsibility considering German atrocities.  So now it's all just art, but art gutted of its moral dimension, which, no matter how well- done, leaves you feeling empty.  Am I the only jerk who gets this?<br /><br />Nothing new here regarding sex, death, fear, sadism and deception - we've seen it all before. Heck, \\"Dragnet\\" with Dan Ackroyd probably is the basis for the satanic material here.<br /><br />What is special here though is the counterpoint created between Dr. Bill's innocence and everything else that is demonic, some of it emanating from himself, but most of it coming from the hell-fire of New York City. He wishes to be led but ends up being followed by the creepiest NYC has to offer, Mafia-style concern for his unsafety.<br /><br />Normal sex leads to babies, which can be a good thing. This is captured in the scene where Kidman's character is teaching the daughter math. Trouble comes when sex gets separated from procreation, like Eve with the apple. Dr. Bill wants to get back to his normal life, but Kidman's character wants to get back to the kind of sex that is supposed to hold mairriages together, which, as we have been witnessing for over an hour, is very dangerous.<br /><br />Where Kubrick stands on this topic is somewhat unclear, but the final word is a four letter one starting with the letter f and the film starts with gratuitous sexual arousal. Where he stands is not important, though, and that's why I give this film a good rating because the saytrs who watch it will be none the wiser and the rest of us get a chance to review how far gone the modern world is.<br /><br />For those seeking scriptural guidance:<br /><br />This message is sent to you by the One who is holy and true, and has the key of David to open what no one can shut and to shut what no one can open...My advice to you is to buy pure gold from Me, gold purified by fire - only then will you truly be rich. And to purchase from Me white garments, clean and pure, so you won't be naked and ashamed; and to get medicine from Me to heal your eyes and give you back your sight.
B0029XFN9O|5.0|A lot of people out there seem to not really like Home Alone 2, but happily I do! I was 10 when this movie came out and now I'm 29 and I still enjoy it as much now as I did then, but maybe for nostalgic reasons now. This movie was ragged on for being even less plausible, more cartoonish, having more amped up violence and well being pretty much the same as the first movie just a different locale. And I guess I understand now being an adult all the problems with the movie, but for all of its faults there is just as many funny and warm moments which for me cancel out the problems. You can complain about a lot of things in this movie, but just sometimes it's better to let go, have fun and enjoy a Christmas movie. Plus I get great joy seeing bricks being thrown at someone's face lol
B005WGBQ9G|5.0|Great tv show, with plenty of real life struggles mixed in a bit of zombie action. Nothing stupid either...no cheesy 80's zombie stuff. This show supports a real story. I have ready the comic is is based off of a few years ago. It was also very gripping. This is a great serious for the zombie follower.
B005DOKM9M|3.0|As others have said \\"It smells\\".  But the smell does dissipate over time.  Pros:  Protects the Kindle Fire from dirt, scratches, etc.    Looks good    Lightweight  Cons:  The smell (although it does go away eventually)    The price - It's just not worth the cost of materials (and cheap labor) to justify the cost of this item.    One would expect higher grade construction at this price-point.  I would recommend that you explore other options before deciding on this item.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|The ratings for this movie have a U-shaped distribution, which means that it's largely a \\"love it or hate it\\" experience.  I'm sincerely glad that some people enjoyed it, but unfortunately I have to be counted more in the \\"hated it\\" group.  Up to about 2/3 of the way into the movie, I still had hope that it could be a winner, since the movie at least had some intensity and sexual tension, but alas when it was over I felt that it had all been a waste of time.<br /><br />Why so harsh?  Well, none of the characters are well developed, none of the relationships are well developed, not much really happens in the movie, and most importantly it never becomes clear what the lead character's problem is.  Was she always mentally ill?  What kind of mental illness did she have?  What was the cause?  Why was she not receiving any form of treatment?  Why did her mother allow her to pursue the rigors of ballet despite her condition?  There are no answers to be found in this movie.  In the end, I felt that shallow intrigue and gimmicks had been substituted for substance, with a big-name actress used to lure us in.<br /><br />Needless to say, I can't recommend this movie (even if you're a ballet fan), but I'll now have a look at some of the favorable reviews to see why some people liked it.<br /><br />Addendum: I've now finished reading several of the favorable reviews, and it seems that those reviewers tend to take this as a relatively abstract movie and often apply a psychoanalytic perspective.  Again, good for them, but I think that asks viewers to fill in too many blanks.  A movie should meet the viewer at least half way, and I don't think this one does.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Was very surprised and pleased by this game.  Was afraid  it would be more of a hidden object which I've only found only one to be good.  It played very well on the Kindle Fire.  Would be happy if a few more like this came out.  .99 for an hour of fun.  I'm all for it
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Simply put: music sounds better with these headphones.<br /><br />These are my first pair of higher quality headphones, and I have been super impressed by them. They are comfortable for long sessions of music listening. They effectively block out quiet and medium outside noises, and with your music even at a moderate level (I usually use 30% volume on computer and 30% in Windows Media Player) these things can take you away into a musical wonderland. You can hear every single thing in songs. Anybody that considers music a passion should have a pair of these.<br /><br />The first time my roommate tried them he listened for about 15 minutes to music he doesn't even normally listen to, and he was hooked.

B004SDSSFY|5.0|Just downloaded this, opened it, then directed to download theblatest version which is the other FREE version available.  Downloaded that, then reopenedbm this version to make sure.  Registered andvthat was it. Within app, I clicked on Upgrade to see if full version was unlocked, and it was.  This IT gal loves DtG, ever since my Tmobile Wing Windows OS and Sprint Blackberry days.  Glad to see this full version for free, now if I can get it for free on my Sprint Ego I'd be a happy techie!  I prefer DtG over Quickoffice, DtG has been in the lab longer and more effectively in updates.  Downloading now to my other Kindle for my son.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|The movie is really good, and so far I really like the extras.  But they get an absolute 1 star for this crappy ultraviolet digital copy sham.  I'll do my best to avoid any blu-ray's that contain Ultraviolet copies in the future.
0553807919|4.0|The first part of this book was painful to read, but I'm glad I stuck with it. Starting off, I was pretty sure the science would be terrible because every child is a \\"whole-brain child\\" but it does get better and the science gets more accurate. I still take issue with the left-brain, right-brain dichotomy, but I see where the authors were trying to go with that.   Most  of the strategies presented aren't anything new but I appreciate the \\"whys\\" behind the advice they give because is helpful to have a basic understanding of child development  from a neurological standpoint. If you're anything like me, someone can tell you all day long that you need to do something but it doesn't truly make sense until I understand the underlying reasoning and the authors do a great job of presenting that information without bogging the reader down.   The most helpful part of the book are the last pages where each strategy is broken down by age group. This provides a great summary and I would suggest skimming over these pages once a week or so to keep the strategies in fresh in the mind so they are right there when they need to be recalled.  Parenting advice is everywhere and it can be hard to figure out what to trust, so it's nice to see one that gives some support for its conclusions. While there's no hard and fast rules that will work in every situation, The Whole-Brain Child provides wonderful strategies that should work in most.I Just keep in mind, if you've already read several other similar books (basically positive parenting) you're probably not going to find new strategies here.

B000PC6A3E|5.0|First of all, forget your memories of Burton's films of Batman because this is much, much different.  Christopher Nolan takes a much darker approach to Batman and tends to swerve farther away from a comic book type feel for the movie.  Where Burton often used bright colors and dramatic close ups of caricatures of the infamous DC universe, Nolan takes a more subdued view of the characters and focuses on their psyches instead of their looks and over personalities.<br /><br />Batman Begins, quite literally, spends its time showing the audience just how Bruce Wayne developed his alter-ego and then put that other side of him into effect so that he might make Gotham City a better place.  After his father died the city fell into the hands of greedy, biased, and lucrative men who allowed all of the hard work Bruce's father put into the city to fall to the wayside.  Constantly filled with anger and hate for the iconic thug that killed his parents and the city's inability to hold itself up, Bruce flees.  He searches for something to help him and he finds it in the idea, in the concept, in the teachings of Ra's al Ghul.  However, unable to completely follow the definition of \\"justice\\" presented to him, Bruce returns to Gotham City with specialty training under his belt and a new definition of what he needs to be.  What follows is a heart-stopping, action-packed thrill ride that speaks to any fan of the Batman tradition.<br /><br />The main villain here is Scarecrow.  Just like Ra's al Ghul, he is not a well-known villain, but he definitely was part and parcel of the comics and deserves his place in the spotlight.  More importantly, however, the villain in this movie is based on fear.  Fear can control, can infiltrate hate, can skew logic, and can make people weak with the inability to act.  Bruce suffered from fear for most of his life which turned into hate and loathing.  The people of Gotham City live in fear and distress, unable to lift themselves out of the mire because of that fear.  Ra's al Ghul and Scarecrow both use fear to further their means while Batman, Bruce, also taps into the fear well to be used for the better.  It is the process of overcoming the psychosis of fear that makes this film so fascinating.  It, like the comic books, is something we can relate to and allows us to empathize with the characters.  Through this the true story of finding one's identity and fighting fear arises.<br /><br />A great film for the layman and for the comic book connoisseur alike.Ghul and Scarecrow both use fear to further their means while Batman, Bruce, also taps into the fear well to be used for the better.

B0053ZOQMK|4.0|Outstanding animation work and chock-full of references and nods to other films, Rango can be summed up as funny entertainment that may be more aimed at adults and film buffs than kids.  A joy to watch, and more than once just in case you miss something the first time around.

Hard, metal sounds with 'This Means War' and 'Kiss it Goodbye' mixed with beautiful, soft ballads \\"Holding On to Heaven' and Trying Not to Love You.'  And, what can I say about Lullaby?  Probably THE most beautiful song the guys have ever recorded!!.  Move on to the tongue and cheek songs 'Gotta Get Me Some' and Midnight Queen'...yeah, Nickelback is back and it was worth the wait!!!

B004ZJZQJ2|5.0|Maybe Steven Soderbergh's best film and one which he won an Oscar.  The movie won 3 others including supporting actor Benicio Del Toro who plays a Mexican state police officer involved in curtailing drug smuggling near the Tijuana/San Diego border.  The movie is a complex drama with 3 distinct stories going on at the same time.  The stories intersect at times but do not neatly end up at the same point in the end.  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the pregnant wife of a drug kingpin in San Diego who is jailed because of a captured snitch who ratted him out.  The other story involves Michael Douglas as the newly appointed national drug czar whose own teen age daughter is captive to cocaine and heroin.  As you can imagine, you have to pay attention.  The movie is shot a lot with hand held cameras, but it is done in a way that you just feel you're along for the ride.  This technique is used primarily where action takes place.  For example, during a drug raid or when someone is running up a flight of stairs.  Another technique which was a bit of a distraction was the different colorization of the film.  Again for example, much of the scenes in Mexico had an almost brown tint.  When Douglas' character is first seen in his Cincinnati home town, everything is shot in a murky black and white.  The cast is chock full of actors now much more famous on the big screen and television.  Many probably owe much to this film. It's a classic.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|I've been using DtG for several years (first on BlackBerry) and purchased it as soon as I moved to Android. For the most part, it does work very well.<br /><br />The quirks that I have with the program are minor. First, there doesn't seem to be a way to change input methods while actually in a document. I tend to switch keyboards depending on what I am typing (and one keyboard has better voice to text dictation). I end up having to make sure I select the right keyboard before opening a document. I don't have this problem with the other mobile office apps.<br /><br />The other issue is that DtG doesn't seem to be able to open every document. If I edit something in Quick Office, DtG can error out when trying to open the document later.<br /><br />Other than that, the functions work well. It is a good app and well worth having.
B003VB5E2E|5.0|I can't give enough praise for this umpteen iteration of Clapton's Chicago fundraiser.  Set in Toyota Stadium (Chicago Fire soccer) in June 2010, Clapton again manages to gather nearly all of the great rock/blues/country guitar players in the world today.  At least those that can still travel.  There's nothing bad here other than Clapton's hair, so I have a hard time picking favorites but I'll try:  Sonny Landreth on the first 2 tracks, Doyle Bramhall II, Gary Clark, Jr., John Mayer Trio, Derek Trucks & Susan Tedeschi Band, Buddy Guy with Jonny Lang & Ronnie Wood, Jeff Beck, Clapton & Steve Winwood and the finale with the great B.B. King.  The camera angles and editing are wonderful with interesting shots of crowds and especially other artists legitimately watching their peers perform.  There are no B.S unrehearsed jams that are not musical.  The transition between acts is brilliant and the voiceovers are brief and salient.  The 2 disc set clocks in at 4 hours and 39 minutes in lossless DTS HD Master Audio.  I could go on!

B004SDSSFY|2.0|I compared this to three other pro office products for word, excel, and PowerPoint editing.  I can't say there was a clear winner, but Documents to go was the worst.  You can only edit text in a PowerPoint, not graphics.  This is common though as 3/4 had this limitation.  The big issue is no on screen controls for doing common things.  Like formatting cells, or changing font size.  And features are missing the others have.  Oh and this rendered my PDF book cover wrongly.  It looked like a jigsaw puzzle.  These are big programs so a proper review should be big.  Sorry I don't have time for that.  I just did some common things in each program.  In every case dtg was harder and slower to use, and some things I couldn't figure out.  The others would rate four stars to this three stars.  But even for the others I found for each document type I prefered a different program.

0446547654|2.0|This book was a dissapointment.  I have read every single Nicholas Sparks book, and loved every one until this book.  The book had a terrible ending and so many characters were not well developed.  Usually, a Nicholas Sparks book really has you in love with the characters, but not this time.  I will still be a Sparks fan and continue to read his books, but this one was not worth the time or money I invested.

1451627289|4.0|I really enjoyed this book for the most part.  It was the best King book in a while.  However, the tediousness of the middle, with all the boring parts when the main character was killing time in Jodie working for the school and falling in love and directing plays and saving the day etc, etc. really hurt the overall book in my opinion.  I LOVED how it ended, and it was ironic that I actually said to myself \\"This ending is nothing like the typical King ending recently\\" only to find that his son actually gave him the ending for this book.  LOL.  I just wish his son would have given him a better ending for Under the Dome and Duma Key.  Overall, this was a better book than Under The Dome, if not for just the ending.
B005YDLJ76|4.0|I really don't understand what's with Beyonce and her concert DVDs lately. She keeps over editing them, and I'm not addressing the clips spliced in between but I'm addressing the music. Why edit down music like this? Why is a show that took 1hr and 30 mins chopped down to 1hr and 18 which includes 5 minutes of credits.   I think she did amazing. She is the best performer of the generation. The video is obviously taken from multiple shots because one of her tassels on her dress is broken off in some parts and not in others.   Also! the set list was reorganized for the 4 songs. I kind of skipped through the First part because honestly, its exactly like the I am yours live from the Wynn DVD.   A major problem for me is the band! I HATE BEYONCE's NEW DRUMMER!! She's nowhere near as good as the other drummers. The drums sound stale and lack bass. ALSO, the sound quality is terrible. I can barely hear the bass guitar in a song like End of Time which is bass prominent.   Overall I wouldn't suggest buying this DVD. Actually you should wait to buy the Deluxe Edition whenever it comes out because it features behind the scenes and videos.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|This is such a nice, well thought-out app. It was definitely worth the money. You won't regret buying this app!
1451627289|5.0|Darn good read!  Sure, it was a bit long, but not too long where I had to either put it down or skip through. 20 hours non-stop.  Interesting characters, lush descriptive scenes - espescially of bygone days. I think the dialog was written very believably and not overdone. Great plot of course, so rich with ideas and possibilities to think about. I found myself pondering certain paragraphs for minutes before continuing reading.  I started though with two reservations. 1. How would King hold my interest regarding all the various and disparate time travel paradoxes? And 2. How would he approach the actual real history surrounding the main event?  The paradoxes. Whfew! I'm still pondering all this! But - I think his writing pace is so brisk and engaging that one doesn't have the time to dwell on the actual nuts and bolts science. It's really the way it should be.  The actual history. I was leery as to how Mr. King would, through the story, treat Oswald. I knew from the reviews that \\"Ozzie\\" would be a primary focus but would King fall down the rabbit hole that so many of the Tin Foil Hat people have succumbed? Would the writer bore us with yet another bat-guano crazy conspiracy plot? Thankfully he doesn't. To his credit he has enough sense to realize that Oswald himself (and his family) are much more interesting to explore than some 6th degree of separation \\"fact\\", otherwise known as random coincidence. Sometimes a grassy knoll is ...  I know that the actual history is not the focus of the book, and King mentions in his afterward that one won't find answers in this regard. For that he mentions Wm Manchester's book \\"Death of a President\\" and also Gerald Posner's \\"Case Closed\\", both excellent accounts. For some reason he fails to cite V. Bugliosi's \\"Reclaiming History\\" - probably the definitive and most thorough study written.  Who will play Sadie in the movie? Who will play De Mohrenschildt?
0896898288|5.0|I bought this book several months ago and have read it twice. The letters from the farmer's wives are priceless, truthful and a joy to read! As a beginning quilter the squares are truly inspiring. It is amazing to see all that ladies put into their precious quilt squares and what skill and patience went into their work. And to read their opinions about marrying a farmer really connects you to how very different we each are and yet in many ways we are the same. I highly reccommend this book to anyone who loves history, country living and quilting. A great read!

B004LWZW8S|1.0|Immortals is so bad a five year old could have written a more coherent story! It's the most boring piece of war gore I have ever seen in my entire life! The violence is so tedious and predictable, Immortals borders on camp! But you do get to see psychopathic behavior in all its depraved glory! This pathetic film leaves you feeling like you have to go brush your teeth after spitting something out that tastes bad! Good job, Hollywood! The toothpaste companies of the world salute you!<br /><br />Sorry, but as hot as Henry Cavill is, he's just not worth $14.00 to drool over his gorgeous muscles! That's right, a single ticket cost $14.00! Now you get ripped off by being forced to watch stinkers in 3D! And it didn't even make any difference that I could see!<br /><br />What made me such a sucker to see such a lousy, rotten movie? I love fantasy as a genre. The movie trailer was fantastic. It appears there's even a scene in the trailer that was not in the movie! I like ancient Greece as a subject matter. And, I was in the mood to gawk at some hot, sweaty bodies! But now I'm so frustrated at wasting my hard earned money that the next time I have the urge to see a movie in a theater, I'm going to rent one for free from the library. It will give me great pleasure to spite Hollywood for deceiving me! A movie trailer should never be so much better than the movie it is supposed to represent!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|This story has no plot really to speak of. Yes Ignatius wants to make the wheel of Fortuna stop plopping him down where he doesn't want to be, but he basically wanders around aimlessly spouting pompous absurdities everywhere he goes. I can understand why Publishers were averse to publishing this, and also why some don't like the story. I don't think someone 'doesn't get it' if they don't like this one. As most know the book not being published was a horrible tragedy that resulted in John Kennedy O'Toole committing suicide. That said it is not for the plot that this is a masterpiece or why it won the Pulitzer Prize. It is the book's entirely realized characters. Each is unique each stays in character through every action, word and thought, even the old man in prison sorting through the belongings in his pocket. In addition the humor in this novel is unparalleled. I could agree some scenes seem to drag on a bit long and are repetitive, but the novel's overall originality and attention to detail overcomes these flaws. This is certainly a case of a novel's overall greatness overcoming it's limitations. I can't give this book less 5 stars in spite of its problems. The things it does well are simply done too well to justify that. Not a week goes by where I don't think of a scene or detail in the story and chuckle or as Jones might say, \\"Whoa!\\"
B000001GQT|5.0|A great CD of Strauss. For under $10? what a deal. This recording of Zarathustra is one the best that I have heard even after 30+ years. Well worth the money and it was sent promptly as well. Richard would be happy with this one.

6304779607|3.0|Cobra, 1986 film     The story begins in a grocery store where a man starts shooting with a 12-gauge pump shotgun. [Senseless violence!] The police arrive to try to stop this maniac. One man goes inside to stalk the killer. [Who wrote this script? Note the product placement.] \\"The show is over.\\" There is another scene with two cars. The television set plays Christmas advertising. [Peace on earth?] The \\"Night Slasher\\" is a serial killer who has fifteen victims so far. Two men attack a lone woman in a car. The knife wounds linked her to the other murders. Do they need more policemen? There is another killing in a parking garage. The police interview the survivor. It was too dark to see details, she says. Will the killer try to complete his attack? Cabretta arrives to stop the two villains. But one continues to hunt the survivor.  A fire alarm brings everybody out of their hospital rooms, saving the survivor. They have a plan to take the survivor to a safe house. But the villains knows this and prepare a trap. There is a car chase on the highway, then through an alley, and into a parking garage. A lot of shooting and explosions. Cars bouncing off ramps and bridges! \\"Oh my God!\\" There is a conflict among the police over the proper policy to be followed. \\"You gotta have faith.\\" \\"Tell it to the judge.\\" [As if judges didn't have to follow the laws.] They stop to eat. Fries and ketchup? [Not weight conscious.] There seems to be a small army of killers conspiring against this woman. Is there a leak from the inside? Cobra has explosive devices and an H&K MP-5 as part of his toolkit. Cobra gets friendly with the woman.  The gang of killers attacks with guns and petrol bombs. Cobra tosses grenades for explosive effects. They race away in a pick-up. Cobra is the tail gunner. The shooting goes on, they flee to an orange grove and the juice factory. The shooting continues inside the factory. [There is never a shortage of ammunition.] There is a confrontation to provide a dramaticconversation. Then a hand-to-hand fight! [But we know who will win.] There is a fiery death for a villain. \\"Let's get out of here.\\" Can Cobra get his car replaced? \\"Its not in the budget.\\" \\"No hard feelings, pal.\\"  There is a high level of violence and a high body count to distract you from a thin story. The beginning part is about two serial killers, like some actual true crime (the \\"Hillside Strangler\\"), then turns into a gang attack upon a lone policeman (echoing \\"Rambo\\"). What was the point of having an inside source to betray the police? Was this credible? I think this talent and budget was wasted in this film.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Not only is this the worst album Metallica ever played on but it is the worst album in the history of music (if you can even call it music). This album is so bad it gave me nightmares. Whatever credibility Metallica had left is gone with this album. St. Anger is a masterpiece compared to this. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this piece of crap.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I am not an Apple guy, never owned a single product made by Apple.  I enjoy technology and find Apple products at times amazing, but have stayed in another world.    The book is organized in a fashion that made it an enjoyable read.  Each chapter being a big event or big product. I found the first 3/4 of the book the most interesting because the last 1/4 is a lot of stuff I already knew about the newest Apple Products.    The best parts of the book to me are early on and continue until he is fired from Apple and then when he first comes back to Apple in 1997. The stand out point for me and the point I walked away with is that Steve Jobs could be a jerk.  He used a management style not used by \\"good\\" leaders of staff in most settings.   The thing I do think that the author does wonderfully is be completely fair about Steve Jobs and his competitors. He discusses Jobs' insistence on the \\"integrated\\" or \\"closed\\" environment for Apple Products and presents Jobs' argument for this strategy.  The author then explains why the open system has advantages too, advantages Microsoft and Google (through Android) have succeeded with.  One can not help but walk away from the book and know you got an honest look a the man.  You might also wonder like I am right now, having just finished the book, if knowing Jobs' poor treatment of people including staff and strangers is a good thing to be known.  The book does not push me to purchase Apple products, but it does make me wonder how strong the company can possibly be without Jobs.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|Ok let's be clear, I feel that the 1982 John Carpenter's The Thing is the scariest and best horror movie I have ever seen. No film before or since has scared me as much as that film (granted I was 13 when I saw it). When I heard of a film at first remaking, and then covering the events prior to this film, I was to put it mildly very skeptical to outright hostile about this film. My view was that it was a stupid idea since you know what happens if they stay true to the original film. Then slowly but surely I had heard things (pun intended) about the film. I liked the cast and not just for Mary Elizabeth Winstead. I finally decided to go and see it and I was not dissapointed. The film faithfully stays true to the era (no PCs or cell phones) and to the film(it ends as the JC film begins with a helicopter chasing a Thing dog). What happens in-between was a treat to watch. The Thing really lends itself to CGI making the creatures far more lethal then their animatronic versions in 1982. The acting is first rate as is the science of discovering who is or isn't the Thing. The tension and suspicion of the first film is with you until the final reel and they do leave the camp in the same condition so Kurt Russell can find it in 1982. The fun is how they get there and what happens to everyone. If you are a fan of JC's The Thing this is a great supplemental film that adds it's own stamp to the story while setting you up for the first film.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|A lot of films strive to 'place' the viewer in the place of the protagonist of the story.  To cause the viewer to feel and sympathize with the hero of the film, and cheer him on.  It's difficult to think of a film that does just this more productively than 'Submarine'.  I went into it knowing nothing about the movie, and came out of it feeling like I had just spent time with a close friend.<br /><br />Ultimately, 'Submarine' is an exploration of a young man's adolescent failures and tiny successes, but every thought that 'Oliver Tate' (our hero) stammers aloud is met with touches of humor, confusion, anger, conflict, romance and anxiety from both the cast around him and the audience.  'Submarine' is perfectly cast and hits its mark time and time again.  I had a great time hanging out with Oliver and his family, and reliving the awkwardness and thrills of young love and adolescence.<br /><br />A great directorial debut from Richard Ayoade (yes, the guy with the afro on 'The IT Crowd')... I can't wait to see where he takes us next.

B005R4255C|5.0|I saw the Cirque du Soleil show last month and was so impressed by the artistry & the genius that was Michael Jackson.  The show is really an experience. A blend of dozens of classic songs, acrobatics, dance ..all with a special MJ touch.  This soundtrack bring the music and the show closer to the audience.  Great remixes. Crisp strip down vocals.   Excellent soundtrack.
B005SV9W4Q|1.0|I don't even know where to begin. Lady GaGa makes some of the best commercial electro pop dance music going. It's sad that CD singles don't really exist anymore, because several of the singles from this album have had promotional releases loaded with dance mixes--and I was HOPING some of those mixes might end up on this collection. Particularly mixes of You & I, since it hit #1 on the billboard dance charts--but most definitely not with any of the dreary mixes included here.<br /><br />What we get is a predominantly experimental collection of dubs with barely any vocals. There are a few thumping dance beats thrown in that make you try to convince yourself that the particular mix makes the CD worth the purchase, but you soon realize that you'd much rather listen to the actual flawless version from GaGa's album. Honestly, I cant' see EVER listening to this CD again now that I've heard it once.<br /><br />As a huge fan of GaGa, I expect SO much more than this.

B004SUWR2C|4.0|Happy to say, this works fine on the Kindle Fire for me. I was skeptical due to the number of negative reviews, but I love UNO and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />If I could, I would rate it 3.5 stars, not four. But only because of the weird rules the game seems to have by default, despite calling them normal or \\"classic\\". The graphics are quite good for a simple card game. However, they can't seem to decide between 2D and 3D.<br /><br />It is worth $1.50 probably. Not $3.00. But I don't regret buying it.
B005LJK3AC|2.0|I was encouraged to rent this because of the quality of the cast.  But, honestly, I could not make it through more than about 40 minutes of the movie --and at that point I was really pushing my patience, hoping it would get better.  While the premise has potential for comedy, the humorous moments were few.  Mostly, it was a painful, joyless experience watching the characters struggle for freedom from their horrible bosses.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|After using the case for about a week, I can say that this is case/cover is: 1)very durable 2)light weight 3) offers decent protection.  I especially like the elastic strap.  I'm sure that by the time the elastic tension degrades, I will probably have a different Kindle.    The $30 price for this cover is inline with what I would expect from a new product(kindle fire)accessory of this quality.  Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews.

0470901071|4.0|Foremost, this book shouldn't be anyone's only source to pass the CCNA, although I am certain that Todd Lamle covers all the required material in the book. I have read the book 2 times cover-to-cover and about a third time skimming it over for review. I would certainly recommend it as I feel that it has greatly helped me pass the CCNA exam.  I marked the review as 4-stars for 2 main reasons.   First, I would have benefit tremendously if it were a Hardcover. After I was finished with it, there were whole sections and chapters unbound from the binding. Second, there are a few typos, issues with figures/tables/diagrams, and sections where he would copy something mentioned in a previous section. I agree whole-heartedly that the material doesn't seem as \\"dry\\" as Cisco Press, but there are points where it seems that there is too much \\"filler\\" (jokes, etc.) that wastes reading time.   I really enjoyed the structure of the book, size of the font, readability, how my highliter didn't bleed (too much) into the back of the pages. It made me want to learn more than just the basics, instead of just cramming test questions for the CCNA.   I would, however, recommend using a test engine to complement his book to assist with answering questions. I must also mention that it is critical to use either GNS, Packet Tracer, or actual routers/switches to work on by setting up some labs to become efficient with Simlets for the exam.  If you would like to know the basics for Routing and Switching, you definitely found a great place to start.   Good luck on taking your exam!
1451627289|5.0|Believe it or not...I had never read a novel by Steven King before.  However when I heard about this book I thought it sounded interesting, plus I was looking for a large book that would last me longer than the previous books I had read.  Well, that didn't happen...  This story is INCREDIBLE!  There were many times where I could not put the book down.  You're told that it's a story about time travel ahead of time, but there's SO much more to it than that.  King obviously did his research well.  When he describes the surroundings it feels like you are in the past with the character, Jake.  (Or George...)  The historical aspects were just as good to read as the fiction ones.  I was so into this book that I often didn't realize what was going on in my own surroundings.  At one point I was actually cooking dinner and reading it at the same time.  I could go on and on about this book, but I'll keep it short.  Plenty of other reviews have gone over what the story is about in great detail, so I don't think I need to do that.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.  It's a fantastic read!
0061353248|4.0|This is a terrific book with the author giving an inexhaustive list of examples of our own irrational behavior we fall prey to and should observe in others. I gave four stars as I felt the tests in lab settings eventually wore a bit thin and I would have loved to see more examples from the \\"real world\\", perhaps \\"ripped from the headlines\\".   Nonetheless, Ariely serves up an irresistable look at human behavior that turns the traditional views of economic man on its head(s).   I'm a voracious reader on books on decision-making and this is one of the best!
1609419693|5.0|I loved this book! And Tina is hilarious with her common sense approach and witticisms about mothers and working and trying to do it all. She keeps it real for sure. It has SNL snippets, second city insights, 30 Rock too. (on audio book)<br />The last five minutes Tina should spend her time on is another book! (You gotta get the book to find out what this means)

B006B31B80|4.0|It took six shows deep into season two but they're finally on the right track. I imagine someone high enough up on the food chain finally reviewed the season footage and had the epiphany of, \\"Hey, don't people want to see zombies in a zombie show? Maybe we should give them more of that.\\" They almost have the rule figured out: zombies must be seen at least twice in every episode, and the first one must be seen within the first 20 minutes, minimum. This time it took until the second half hour so they're close, so close, but regardless its definite progress.   It helped that they were tackling some weighty issues in the first half: Are walkers just seriously sick people, not fully responsible for their actions? How badly does something need to be scavenged; is it worth risking somebody's life to get it? And I particularly liked that gun control and abortion were dealt with realistically and without political bias. A baby's cry could feasibly cause someone's death. That's a valid point.  Massive props to Maggie for the verbal smackdown she gave both Glenn and Lori. Why is he always receiving the suck jobs and why should other people run her errands at all? I felt like she was giving voice to a lot of viewer concerns, and frankly it was relieving. Speaking of, it was nice to see common sense showing its head once again. Notably with Shane's instructional technique and Maggie and Glenn not using it when out gathering. Yes, the term \\"safe\\" probably needs a fantastic redefinition nowadays. \\"I thought town would be safe.\\" Based on what you saw in your own little town or the desecration of Atlanta? Get used to it, there is no safe. Not anymore. It's all relative now.  The show is worth watching again. It's effectively merging the graphic novels (which by the way, were not always great. Some of them aren't interesting AT ALL) with a viable TV show and its pulling it off. Sure, not flawlessly, but that's rare even on the best of shows. It's good. It's fun. And it's watchable again.
B000ROALE4|5.0|Slayer's new album is one of 2006's best and it's their first studio album in 5 years. Dave Lombardo is also back on drums and it's their first album with him in 16 years. It's a return to their '80s and early '90s roots although it still has some of their later and heavier metal roots, like God Hates Us All mixed with Seasons In The Abyss. It was a complete surprise and the best they've done since Seasons. Supremest is one of the best songs they've ever done. Christ Illusion gets the best metal album of the year, in my opinion. There are a few mediocre tracks but it has some of their best songs to date also, definitely a must have for Slayer fans.
B005WLQQ4Q|1.0|I can't believe that people actually buy this piece of crap. Talentless dorks like them should not be doing music.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Stained Class is still my favorite along with Sad Wings and Sin After Sin but Defenders comes next. It's heavier, less commercial and more melodic than their previous '80s albums. It sounds similar to Painkiller but with more various tempos throughout the album. It ranges from fast, slow and mid paced tracks. It's a bit darker than the rest of their '80s catalog also. It includes their singles Freewheel Burning, Love Bites, Jawbreaker and Some Heads are Gonna Roll. Screaming for Vengeance and British Steel are considered better in general but I disagree with the majority. Defenders covers more ground and it's their last truly amazing CD in my opinion, as much as I like Painkiller and Angel Of Retribution.
B00132S74A|4.0|Follett has a lot of gifts as an author. Rarely does his work hold together as a near masterpiece like his other book Pillars on the Earth. Code to Zero is great, and it is one of the better Follett books that I have read. The plotting is tight, and everything that happens moves us towards the ultimate goal of the rocket launch at Cape Canaveral. There are lots of action, and several appealing subplots, including romance. Yet I was upset in the end. What Collete's strength is, that he writes the characters with great depth and his books are easy to read and follow. If you're a Follett fan you'll have read this book anyway, if you're not, and you're a picky reader you won't like this.
B0000630BT|4.0|Painkiller is an excellent album and their best in a while, a huge step up from their last 2. They changed direction here, rather than progressive metal they went for a more stripped down heavy metal genre. It's definitely their heaviest album of the Halford era. The songs sound similar to Defenders Of The Faith but heavier and rawer. It isn't as dark either but the songwriting is still decent and it's an enjoyable album. The double bass drum gives it a unique sound and it has some great drumming by Scott Travis. Painkiller is a classic track, All Guns Blazing and Metal Meldown are also some of my personal favorites. Painkiller is easily one of the best albums of the '90s.

B0043URV5U|4.0|When it has came down to Bob Seger musically, he has been one of the most distinctive singer/songwriters to have ever came from Detroit. His classic rock signatures have been a deep blessing for over 40 years. Still, his music has been so strong with classics that have never lost their luster. But, he has been a bit distinctive into why he hasn't made his songs available for download individually. Yet, it has been 6 years since the music downloads have been available for other artists, but only one or two songs have since 2005 like Wait For Me, but that was later pulled after only being available for a limited time. Now, his classic have reached a whole new generation of fans young and old, and a new compilation of hits have shown his career has been like he has always been, like a rock.<br /><br />Bob Seger's 2011 greatest hits compilation, Ultimate Hits: Rock And Roll Never Forgets, is a distinctive and strong anthology that reflects Bob Seger's legendary career, and it definitely is worth while. The double album includes every one of Bob's classics, and a few guilty pleasures as well that show that his music has not been forgotten. The classic tracks have all been remastered well, and just a reminder of why his distinctive songs are still as strong today, compared to so much of the cheap music from other acts that are out there right now. The collection combines all of the tracks that were highlighted from his definitive Greatest Hits 1 & 2 from 1994 and 2003 including the classic guilty pleasure Old Time Rock And Roll, the bluesy Night Moves, to his overlooked gems like Shakedown from 1988's Beverly Hills Cop II and the intimate Shame On The Moon from The Distance. The collection also features some forgotten tracks too, new and old including his cover of the Christmas classic Little Drummer Boy, We've Got Tonight, and a classic cover of Tom Waits' Downtown Train which didn't get released for nearly 20 years since he recorded it, but is now available. Sadly, the working of Downtown Train isn't as classic as when Rod Stewart did it years ago.

B003162R7E|1.0|Janie Hendrix, Jimi's adopted sister and sole heir to his music copyrights, dropped the MCA record label and signed a new contract for reissuing Jimi's catalog on Sony in 2010.  It seems kinda ridiculous that every 2 or 3 years, whenever she wins a copyright lawsuit or decides to switch record labels, she \\"remasters\\" the entire catalog.  How many victory reissues do we need?  Anyway, she decided to reissue these albums on CD in 2010, which not only generates buzz for guaranteed sales but, also makes her a lot more profit off Hendrix's name.  She cares more about benefits from sales of the physical product more then about protecting the legacy of a great musician.  Here's the truth...  These are the 1997 remasters in new \\"earth-friendly\\" cardboard packaging with a worthless DVD. It's a 17 minute DVD with producer/engineer Eddie Kramer talking about Jimi and playing a snippet of a few songs. We've already heard the songs and know he's good. Nothing interesting or new. The albums should have gotten a fresh remaster for 2010 and the second disc could have been better utilized as bonus tracks, such as outtakes or live stuff.  Even the booklets and disc labels themselves look exactly the same. If you bought the last remasters you don't need any of the main 3 studio albums, Band Of Gypsys, or First Rays. 5 stars for the album itself but, zero stars for the disc. This 2010 reissue is not a remaster and is definitely screwing the public.
B000RZIGVS|2.0|OK, i'll say first off that TNG is my second favorite ST series only to Voyager. The Next Generation has oft been considered the most boring series in the star trek universe, so if you have never seen it then I would suggest you \\"acclamate\\" yourself with original or deep space nine first. The series is filled with endless conferences on the crews emotions, trivial episodes around dr crushers kid(whom many trekkies cant stand!) and controversial socio-political ideas which are touched upon many times throughout the series. It's a mix of the good and the bad, with season 1-2 being great, 3-5 being poor, and 6-7 being fantastic. Overall a great series, but I still prefer Voyager. Anyways on to the box set itself.  When you recieve it, you'll be shocked at the cheap materials used. For starters the clear plastic sleeve will pull apart after using it only 6 times or so. The cheapo green plastic used to house the discs is flimsy and will chip if you look the wrong way. On top of that its taped together with what looks like flimsy mailing tape, which is almost guaranteed to pull apart after a couple of years. Also there are no inserts other than the 20th anniversary insert that comes thoughtlessly slipped into the back end of the set.   Now the worst. The series was simply transferred to DVD. Thats it. No remastering, sprucing up, nothing. When you watch it on your big HDTV that you likely maxed your credit card with, your be heartily dissapointed to see that they didn't even optimize the discs to play in widescreen format... It could have been a simple encoding change and these could be playing at 480P at least, if only to properly fit the modern displays we use today. So big fat black bars on either side of picard's shiny bald head, and if you have a PDP display like my sammy set, you'll also immediatly notice the poor blacks throughout the series...  If it wasnt for the glaring video issues, I would recomend this set without hesitation. But they are bad enough that I just cannot. Be that as it may, I would say wait for the blu ray set will be launched early next febuary. The BD set from what I have read will be leaps and bounds better than this one, being played in full 1080P, remastered etc,.   Thats right! DONT BUY THIS SET!! Its just not worth it this late in the game. If you have netflix, watch it on there first, because the quality is no different! So bottom line is great series, and poor boxed set. WAIT FOR THE BLU RAY!!!   Hope my review helps,  Ryan
B005SV9W4Q|1.0|I love extended versions which respect the original music of songs and our Lady is very skilled at making great music, but I'm not really a \\"remix\\" fan, so this is exactly the kind of record I don't buy because I love the original songs and they are all barely recognizable here. It reminds me of Born this way Deluxe Edition cd 2 : loud and pointless mixes.  I'm a big fan of Lady Gaga and \\"Born this way\\" was and still is a great album no matter what haters might say but these mixes add to my admiration of the original tracks and how Lady Gaga has always managed to find the right sounds to support her beautiful voice and imaginative lyrics.  But this remix album is so awful actually that I'm afraid it might damage her reputation even more, and boy, she doesn't need that right now, especially when she hasn't made the best of choices for singles lately (You and I anyone ?!)  Thank God Marry the night is coming as a single release and I hope that the original versions of Sheisse & Bloody Marry will be released as singles as well followed by a 4th album very soon (I hope). So, let's aim at Lady Gaga's future now and try to forget this release has ever happened. Who's with me ?
B004SDSSFY|5.0|So glad that this is on Amazon for  FREE today! Already purchased it for my iPad and on my Galaxy S2. Heck if I was going to buy it a third time on my Kindle, especially for Android. The big down side to being locked in to the Amazon only app store is having to buy some of the same aOS apps you already own. Works great for doing docs and is seamless with a DropBox. A+!
B005P89F1C|5.0|When i heard this album the first thing i  thought was that they are all covers of songs. Yes they are but there is a Bieber signature originality thats mixed in their which beliebers appreciate. Justin is growing as an artist and as a person and still figuring out his sound. Listening to each track you can feel its inspiration. This album is dynamic and suited for people of all ages and tastes of music.  im not sure if this is what was intended, but these are the artists i can hear being drawn in each song:  (im going to point out my top selections *1 star - 5 star *****)  1 - Only thing i ever get for christmas- CRAIG DAVID ****  2 - Mistletoe - BRUNO MARS/SEAN KINGSTON ****  3 - Chestnuts roasting on an open fire - im not sure i would say Usher or mariah carrey *****  4 - Santa Claus is coming to town- MICHAEL JACKSON ***  5 - FaLaLa - BOYS II MEN ****  6 - All i want for christmas is you - MARIAH CARREY  7 - Drummer Boy - SHAWTY MANE hahahah ***  8 - Christmas Eve- DRAKE!!!!!!! *****  9 - All i want is you - **** im not sure but this song reminds me of another song? like leona lewis or like carrie underwood haha... its really catchy  10 - Home this christmas - sounds kind of like rascall flats.. LOL country music  11 - Silent night - so relaxing put ur kids to sleep with his falsetto! it doesnt sound like anyone but justins very eloquent ! haha  12 - Christmas Love - idk ****  13 - FaLaLa again  14 - Pray - justin bieber ;)  15 - Someday at Christmas - little justin hehe
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I can only believe that the reason ANYONE could possibly give this more than one star is because they have never played the Android or iPhone and even iPad version, which has been available for over 5 years now on iPhone. To label this as HD is false advertising. This version is great if you're living in 1999 & love partying like it's that year. Don't waste your moola unless you're ok with donating to mediocrity, or blissfully ignorant of the real version that has real time online play, way better graphics, and better UI. The real version has been available since the original iPhone. Email Gameloft and demand the high quality version the Kindle deserves. DON'T SETTLE for this crap!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|before this one I had quick office pro trial. it had its own benefits. but this one is awesome opens documents as it suppose to. quick office pro screwed few things when you open documents such as a diagram drawn in pot. This app is great and I recommend you to grab this opportunity

B004U52VPS|5.0|My 5 year old is obsessed with Angry Birds and has been talking about this game since he first saw it in a toy flier. I came to Amazon to see if I could get a better price than the local Target. As I write this review, Amazon.com is asking $33.70 - my local Target has it for about $15. Cute game.............I'd rather have my son playing with a physical game than staring at the laptop or smart phone.
B003UESJEM|3.0|Company men is more of a documentary than a movie. Today it is awfully popular to bash the so-called rich and blame them for the world's problems. As one of our founding fathers once expressed, John Adams, and I am paraphrasing here, rich is relative. In Company Men every level of management from the middle manager to the company president are affected in a downsizing. The movie examines the interesting question -What happens to the company man when he loses his job, his home, and his standing. Can he recover? Does he deserve to recover?<br /><br />A star studded cast which includes Tommy Lee, Jones Ben Affleck and Kevin Costner portrays a day in a few of the lives of each character affected by the downsizing of a company.  Every level of management is affected.  Some never do recover. Some find a refreshing new way to live again. Some are left to face their choices with no redemption. Whatever category you fall into one truth is clear, it is the personal relationships that get you through any horrific life changing event and a sense of self. This honest portrayal of a very difficult life lesson is worth the time.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is not only my favourite horror movie, but me favourite movie in general. I absoluetly love the acting, story, setting, and gore. George Romero's finest. I will not be reviewing the movie but the 4 disc uliimate edition, which is the only way to own this movie. Before I was aware of this set, I owned the anchor bay version, with the theatrical version and no special features, then I found out about this. The anchor bay version cost me 20$, and the ultimate edition was 25$, well worth the extra 5$. This set is packaged nicely with tons of amazing artwork, it contains a sample of the dawn of the dead grapic novel. This set has four discs,one for each of the three versions of the film, and one for special features. I will now be reviewing the three versions. Theatrical: what I originally saw, great mix of score, fast paced and the film that everybody loves. Extened: added nothing important, made the film way more boring, not recommended Eurpopean: my faourite version, better music making it more supsensful, way more gore, and extremely fast paced, the best version. Special Features: two main documebtaries, both extremely good and informative, a great addition to the set. Overiew: A great edition of a great movie, bursting with special features, a nicely desingned case with plenty of artwork, three versions of the film, and the grapic novel sample as an enjoyable bonus. A MUST BUT FOR ANY DAWN OF THE DEAD FAN... THE ONLY VERSION TO OWN...AND A GREAT PRICE!!!!!!!

0525423281|3.0|Liked this but didn't LOVE it liked I loved Stephanie Perkins' first book, Anna and the French Kiss. The story is about costume designer Lola and her inventor neighbor Cricket. They both have crushes on each other. When the story starts Lola has a bad boy boyfriend and Cricket has just moved home.   Cricket seems like a really nice guy, but somewhere it just wasn't Anna.  1. Lola isn't anywhere near as relatable or likeable as Anna. I liked Anna because she was dorky. She was every-girl. Lola, not so much. She makes bad decisions, which is believable, but didn't do any favors to endear her toward me.   2. Cricket is great, but he doesn't make me drool nearly as much as Etienne.  3. Etienne and Anna and both in this book. And sadly, they're like overzealous, love-sick machmakers. Too involved.   4. In Anna, it's Etienne who has a girlfriend and that keeps them apart. In Lola, Lola has a boyfriend. And he's awful. Truly awful. And not even in a love-to-hate kind of way.   5. There's not the witty banter that I liked in Anna.   So maybe I just had high expectations for this book. I liked it. It was a fast read. I finished it in one day and it was enjoyable, but I just didn't LOVE it the way I LOVED Anna. So worth a read.
0525423656|4.0|My Rating: 3.5 stars    I LOVED Matched and the world that was created by Ally Condie and was anxiously awaiting the next book in her trilogy.  Crossed is not as fast paced as Matched.  What I have enjoyed most about Crossed is learning more about Cassia, Ky, Xander along with a couple new characters.  Ally still writes a beautiful story set in an equally beautiful and dangerous world.  Crossed follows Cassia and Ky as they each try to find a way back to each other.  I think it is important for Cassia to experience the different challenges and choices she makes as it helps her to develop a deeper understanding of what it means to love.  Crossed is about sacrifices made on different levels by all the characters, some are seen in the novel and some are just brought up in back stories.     I'll admit that I was all for Ky after the first book, but am very curious to see how the revelations about Xander play out in the third book.  Crossed met my need for more of Ky and Cassia's story, but presented more questions about Xander, Indie (a new character in Crossed), and the Rising.  I enjoyed the use of poems throughout Crossed.  They seem to make the journey of the characters even more personal.  If you are a fan of Matched, you will enjoy Crossed and finding out a little more about your favorite characters, but don't expect a lot of breath holding action.  If anything, Crossed piqued my interest in how Ally Condie will wrap up this beautiful trilogy.
0525423656|3.0|With a title like Crossed I expected more anger, betrayal, action--STORY. This book seriously dragged. It 367 pages and really there are about 10 interesting pages in the whole book, mostly at the beginning and end.   Crossed is the sequel to Matched. It's the story of Cassia's journey to find Ky (a love interest whom she sorted into his fate of constantly being shot at on the fringes of war) and what she finds out about the Society and the rebellion in the process.  There's almost 200 pages of teenage longing. Lots of trekking through the wilderness. Lots. Oh, and lots of poetry. I do so despise poetry.   And there's not nearly enough Xander in the book.   What I liked: I like the blue on the cover. The blue pills are really important to this book. The Society says they're supposed to help you survive in the wilderness, but that might not be what they're for. It's up in the air what they actually do. (view spoiler). I liked what happens to Ky (his new job) and Cassia at the end of the book. That made me smile and if wasn't for that, I would have just dismissed the book.   Also, just as a point of commentary: Society severely restricts music, books, poetry so much that any surviving media is extremely valuable. And yet Cassia and Ky are constantly destroying things. That are valuable. Face-palm.   But really, what is the title about? The first book is more about how Society crossed Ky and Cassia. This book goes into it with all of the pointless deaths, poisonings, lies but the characters never really felt all that angry about it to me. Ky and Cassia both seemed much more flat in this book. We learn more about Ky, which is nice. And he grows through this book. Cassia's going on this huge undertaking to find Ky but I didn't really FEEL for her (except for rolling my eyes at the angst and longing).   The first book didn't really live up to the hype and this one falls short, I'm ambivalent about the third book. Perhaps if it's at the library and I have nothing else to read, but I'm not going to rush out and get it.   And a lot of unanswered questions I had from the first book still aren't answered.   Bottom line: Blah. Story could have been told in about three chapters, not 367 pages. Feel free to skip most of the middle.

0439598427|5.0|My two year old LOVES this book. He never really wanted to call me Mommy until he turned two, when he started calling me \\"MeMe\\" instead. For some reason this book got him saying Mommy and he asks me to read it to him at least 10 times a day. He goes and gets the book and says Mommy! Mommy!... meaning the mommies in the book. (Still calls me MeMe). This edition is well made, the pages are sturdy, and the art and colors are gorgeous. And it's really fun to read. I would give this a million stars if I could. I want more books like it!

1612680003|5.0|I am completely on fire about taking control of my finances and my financial future after reading this book! I have been taught everything \\"poor dad\\" taught Kiyosaki throughout my life and have tried to figure out finances myself. The most compelling idea from this book is that none of us have enough financial education. It's amazing to me that even though Kiyosaki is so amazinly financially successful, throughout the book he states that he continues to go to classes to learn more, he's constantly talking to others to learn more, and he always has an open mind to learn more. Thank you Robert Kiyosaki for this book. I intend on reading all of his other books and also playing the online game that will help me really learn the principles taught in this book. AMAZING!! I'm toally on fire about taking control of my financial future and freeing myself of the rat race!!!!!
B0001GF2DS|5.0|This standard definition, two-disc collectors set of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is likely to be valued by anyone familiar with the film and who recognizes it for the unique role it has played in filmmaking. Though not a high-def offering (you'll have to find that at [[ASIN:B001U6YI92 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]]), this remastered video which includes a substantial amount of original content not seen in the US edition, is a wonderful package. The video quality has been improved through remastering techniques, the surround-sound audio has been included, and the package contains a number of little \\"gift\\" items that, although are not necessarily expensive, are quite enjoyable in their own right. For example, the package includes a small set of four original posters for the movie in Italy, Japan, Spain, and the US printed in high quality gloss embossing on card stock. These are physically small, but are so lovingly printed that they are delightful. In addition, a small booklet with items of note from the movie is included, also on high-quality print and paper. Then, in addition to the movie itself (which is on one DVD) a second DVD containing an entire series of extras and bonuses finishes off the set. For the price, its a \\"tidy little sum\\" (to quote Angel Eyes), and should more than please any fan of the movie. It's a nice little collectors item package.<br /><br />It is not necessary, and is probably too difficult a task, to here write a long passage about the move itself. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is one of those films that was transcendental, that made its mark so strongly that, for many fans of the genre, divides what \\"came before\\" with what \\"came afterward.\\" Its one of those movies that even those with little interest in Westerns could recognize as substantially different and a substantial contribution to moviemaking. Was it the filming techniques, with ultra-wide angle vistas interposed with tight shots of actors eyes? Or was it the script that asked fundamental  questions about life while masquerading as a \\"Western\\"? Or was it perhaps the acting, with a magnificent performance of Tuco and also of Blondie, both of which from that point mark both actor's careers? Or was it the haunting and unmistakable music by Sergio Leone that is instantly recognized the world over, even by those who have never seen the movie? Or a combination of all these?<br /><br />I'm not sure, but I, like many others, upon first seeing this movie was instantly and acutely aware that this was something different, something moving and powerful, something with a message, something that bore (and still bears) repeated viewings, something that played around with deep issues and questions in life, and did so in a truly artistic way. Yes, it is hilarious--picture the opening scene where Tuco comes breaking through the windows with the giant turkey bone in his hand and turkey hanging out of his mouth--and yes, we can choose to watch the movie with any number of mindsets. But there are few movies--and this is one of them--where the viewer can be lifted out of the seat into a world of the storyteller so strongly that one truly forgets that it is a movie being watched. It happens more than once in this movie (in the graveyard scene, in the civil war bridge attack scene, and in the stagecoach scene, for example), but few movies ever can reach this level of narrational power. Its irrelevant that it is a Western. These are just the accouterments that allow the story to progress. Its about greed and wealth, law and order, haves and have nots, war and peace. And more than that.<br /><br />Someone once said to me, \\"Why is it called 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'? There's not really anyone good, bad, or even (really) ugly in the movie!\\" But you see, that's one of the keys here. If you are looking for \\"good,\\" \\"bad,\\" or \\"ugly\\" in the story, you've started on the wrong foot. So, maybe, its one of the mostdeceptive titles in moviemaking. And maybe that's part of the clue to the story itself.<br /><br />Five stars for this wonderful little gift package of one of my favorite movies.ng. And maybe that's part of the clue to the story itself.  Five stars for this wonderful little gift package of one of my favorite movies.

0439023521|5.0|I purchased this book on a whim back in 2009  and I'm so glad I did. I couldn't put the book down! Suzanne Collins has a writing style that flows beautify, she paints a vivid picture with out being descriptive to the point of boring. The story was wonderful, though very morbid. The idea of children being sent to fight to the death is disturbing yet fascinating to read. As the story develops further the reader beings to see past the brutally blunt face of the novel, it is clear that Collins meant for this novel to be a social commentary.   Collins wrote a novel that is very interesting to read and tactfully deals with the issue of political manipulation as well as direct and indirect oppression.    If you are considering buying this book for a child be aware that the subject mater of this book may be disturbing for any young children however the prevalent themes in the story are important lessons to learn as well. While Collins isn't overly graphic in her writing, she is descriptive enough to tell the story fully. A character receives a spear in to stomach, a macabre contestant attempts mutilate another with a knife. Of course it depends on the child, however I think that this book would be disturbing to anyone under 10 and it would be difficult for anyone under the age of 14 to fully understand the themes of the book.     In summary, this is a wonderful book for adults and teens . I'm 21 and my dad (51) loves the books as much as I do. It comments on politics, war, survival, brutality and humanity in a way that is unforgettable.    PS. I'm so glad that Lionsgate decided to let the author, Collins, produce this film! Book to film adaptations are always best when the writer is involved in the film production. If you want an accurate feeling of what the book will be like please watch the trailer [...]
B00628RFPM|5.0|I loved this thoughtful movie.  It left me a little sick at the end but it certainly made the point. Two little boys one is the son of the Commandant in charge of the death camp, the other a little Jewish inmate of the camp, become friends by talking through the barbed wire. The Commandant tries to keep hidden from his children what he really does ( that is put people to death), in keeping his children ignorant, he gets his son killed.  The son innocent and slightly  confused about the camp and barbed wire and seeking adventure, strikes up a friendship with a little boy on the other side of the fence. Ultimately the son and the little boy die together in the gas chambers built by the father, when the Commandant's son tries to help the other boy find his father by sneaking under the barbed wire posing as an inmate. The theme of the story is children have no bias about race, religion, or color unless it is taught to them by adults, and that hate and ignorance of any kind has devastating consequences. The film quality is excellent and, the acting is very good.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I really loved this movie persuasion being my new favorite from Jane Austen. I wish that woman were still around to write more tales of gripping romances to taunt the women of today with what no longer exists courtesy of men being more pig like than previous years, but the cinematography was almost enough to make me turn this movie off in the first 15 minutes, i am sotrry but it looks as if it were filmed by high school students and not good ones either the amateur fades and the poor/exxagerated lighting in the movie made it difficult for me to watch however i loved the casting for all but Mary who i really just wanted to shoot in the face she was so ANNOYING but then again the character in and of herself is rather annoying so maybe she should be applauded for her performance (i cant help but wonder who jane austen based the character of mary as well as the character of mrs. bennett in pride and prejudice off of, she must have been one hell of a nagging woman with all the \\"nerves\\" and \\"illness\\" how long does it take you to recover from a cold woman) back on point though captain wentworth was by far one of my favorite castings of all jane austen movies i have seen yet closely followed by mr. darcy from the 2007 version with keira knightley. I think Anne deserved an award for this movie she played her role magnificently and really made you feel the frustration of the character and how troublesome it was for a woman desperate to speak her mind in a society so oppressive to the thoughts and actions of women. I would recommend this movie if you can get past the cheesy cinematography and anne running around with her head cut off at the end.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|It may surprise people to think about it in these terms, but Kate Bush has been startling audiences with her unique artistic vision in a recording career that now extends across five decades.  She first burst into public view as a teenager in 1978 with her hit single \\"Wuthering Heights\\" and debut album The Kick inside. It was then - and remains today - difficult to comprehend that a work so accomplished, so fully realised (and at times, so deeply personal and confronting) could have been produced by a precocious 19 year old.   The 1980s would prove to be challenging decade for many artists who thrived in the 70s. But Bush flourished, producing a peerless trilogy of boldly experimental and startlingly beautiful albums: The Dreaming (1982); Hounds of Love (1985) and The Sensual World (1989). While the 1990s would prove to be more difficult for Bush artistically (and in some respects personally), after a 12 year absence, she returned in 2005 triumphantly, and at the peak of her powers, with the release of the ambitious double album Aerial.   And now, in another new decade, Kate Bush has, for the first time since 1978, rewarded her patient admirers with two new releases. It is probably fair to say that the first of these two, Director's Cut - which featured reworked material from two earlier albums - confused, and divided her very passionate fans in a way that none of her earlier releases had.  However, there is every reason to believe that 50 Words For Snow will come to be viewed as yet another startling triumph. Apart perhaps from the first single, \\"Wild Man\\", 50 Words, bears little discernable relationship sonically to anything she has produced before. Its lengthy tracks (only 7 songs over a 65 minute playing time) are linked by the snowy theme. They are intimate, even jazzy at times, and are decidedly more impressionistic than anything she has released before. But even on a first hearing, this is unmistakably Kate Bush, and it has all the emotional depth, haunting beauty and romantic lyricism of the best of her work.   Bush continues to see passion and the possibility of beauty and love in places no one else would think to look - she feels lust for a snowman in \\"Misty\\" and compassion for a yeti in \\"Wild Man\\". She duets beautifully with her son against a fragile backdrop of gently falling notes (\\"Snowflake\\") and with an uncharacteristically subdued Elton John she sings of undying love in \\"Snowed In at Wheeler Street\\". The accompaniment, compared at least to her usually lush productions, is starkly minimalistic, but this gentle minimalism is apt given the notionally frigid themes of the album.   But in truth, 50 Words For Snow represents anything but a bleak winter - Bush extracts unimagined warmth and grandeur from the subject matter as only she can. And whether this turns out to be a final recording, or there is still the promise of a new spring to come we should feel blessed that we have once again be allowed to enter her unique and wondrous world.  A must have album for anyone who ever loved her work.   Jason Monaghan

034552554X|3.0|The Language of Flowers is a compelling read which tells the story of Victoria, an abused orphaned girl, who is forced to survive like a dandelion infiltrating through the cracks of a busy urban sidewalk.  The story begins as Victoria celebrates her 18th birthday. She is promptly dropped off to a group home and is told she must find work or she must leave. Directionless, Victoria only knows and cherishes one thing - flowers. As the adult world is harsh and cruel, she isolates herself with only her plants for comfort. They are her only connection to the world around her.  Eventually, desperate situations call for desperate measures. Fighting homeless and starvation, she happens upon a flower shop called Bloom. The store manager befriends her and this is where the story truly begins.  Victoria is a heartbreakingly flawed character. After a life filled with disappointments, she is reluctant to connect with anyone - her employer, her lover, her foster mother - because she cannot allow herself to trust. As a result of a past indiscretion, she does not feel herself worthy of kindness, respect or love. However, her magical abilities with flowers saves her by helping her establish relationships she can no longer ignore. Her maturity as a individual comes as she realizes that she needs others just as much as others come to rely on her.  The author successfully narrates the story from Victoria's perspective, switching between her life at age 9 and the present day. The present day sequences how she survives as a adult while the past sequences describe how she came to understand the Victorian world of flowers. The fact that the author was able to stitch the two storylines together in a complete sense is admirable.  However there are a few criticisms with the novel as a whole which detract from a full 5 star rating.  First, it is the way the book is written. For a child who has gone through a foster care system, the narrative is distinctly devoid of the common venacular. There is little swearing if at all. And it would take a huge suspension of belief to think that a girl like Victoria would write with such an educated prose.   Secondly, certain key plot elements did not make sense. For example, when Victoria is at home without food in her home while looking after a baby, she nearly starves to death before she runs out (sans infant) to buy something at a grocery store. In the real world, she could just bring her baby with her to the grocery store like everybody else does. Such contrivances near the end of the novel really made the second half of the novel much less palatable than the first half.  Finally, the momentum of the novel definitely peters out at the second half which is aggrevated by the prolonged ending. The \\"happy\\" ending for the characters lacked the gritty realism of the beginning. Certainly it is a little too tidy for characters as deeply troubled as the ones in this novel.  I give it a 3.5 stars overall.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|We love the HP movies and will miss not having anymore to look forward to.  Great ending to the series.  I didn't purchase this movie from Amazon, because many folks posted it wasn't going to be available in US with Blu-Ray 3d.  Was able to purchase at Best Buy last weekend.  The blu-ray 3D disc had issues in one scene of the movie, so I had to return it.  Additionally, there is no digital copy in what the average consumer thinks of a Digital Copy.  This ultraviolet thing is a waste and I wouldn't recommend it.  NOTE:  If you contact Ultraviolet and complain they will provide you an Itunes Code, thereby I was satisfied with my purchase.  But I shouldn't have to complain about something to get what I thought I was purchasing.  Call it anything you want but its not a digital copy in the minds of most consumers.  I give two stars for the movie but the fact that I had to return the 3D disc and complain about the digital copy, quite a dissapointment in product quality for HP7.2.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss is set in Paris and revolves around a 17 year old American girl attending an American Boarding School in Paris. Through the story we get to see Paris from Anna's POV and get to experience her amazement of the place, her frustration with the language barrier and everything that comes along with being in a new girl in an unknown place. I loved the characters, how they all related to each other and how the relationship between St. Clair and Anna developed over time. I cried, I laughed, even managed to get a little pissy at time. Its a great feel-good book with lots cultural references, descriptions of landmarks and amazing dialog.

B005TZFZJC|5.0|Rihanna did a really great job on this album.  I think that it is one of her best.  She has a bit of every genre of music that she has covered so far from pop, r&b, dancehall, dubstep, etc.  I also want to note that while this album does have a lot of sexual songs, that is not all there is on the album.  She talks about love a lot on this album.  I would say it's basically half and half love and sex.  The standout tracks on this album in my opinion would be We Found Love, Where Have You Been, We All Want Love, Drunk On Love, and the album title track Talk That Talk.  I think you should purchase this album if you want something fun to listen too.
B004SDSSFY|2.0|So, Amazon gives us two Office suites in as many weeks for free... Which is better?  First of all, the install horked up my phone trying to get DtG to install. Then when starting DtG, there were a whole bunch of BS screens, license agreements, \\"Please register with us\\" nonsense.  I quickly tested some of my larger word/excel docs with both, and DtG choked on the very first one I opened. YMMV, but Quick Office opened EVERYTHING I threw at it. It was also much faster to open a 40MB PDF. Both rendered fine, and I could easily zoom in on a parts diagram with good clarity. QO also had a more intuitive layout for things like rotating the PDF to a readable orientation. Neither app remembered my place in the PDF file for further reading. Disappointing. I should be able to quickly check an e-mail and go back to what I was doing in a 265 page document.  Quick Office had far more features for working with my various online services such as Dropbox. DtG may support Dropbox, but I couldn't easily find it, and after clicking on the wrong option a few times and being asked to buy a \\"premium upgrade\\", I got tired of looking.  In short, if you've already gotten the free Quick Office a few weeks back, you really don't need this. In fact, Quick Office was better in every conceivable way.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|My review title pretty much sums it up. The guy from The Format started this new solo project, which is now a first class and epic indie outfit. Wait? These guys are on a major label?! Hard to believe that it's THIS unique and THIS good! As much as I love my depression-session indie/lo-fi/folk/emo/alt-country/math/space-rock set of usual bands, these guys are a breezy fresh new evaluation of great music. This is a trendsetting album, whether the trend follows or not. In a world bogged down by so much sythesized muck on the radio or the treasures being deeply buried in the 90s or early 2000's, this is an unbelievably unique and creative outlet making the most unconventional and well written songs with a happy sound and swell production! I HIGHLY recommend this gorgeous record! ALL the songs are PERFECTION with breezy minty awesome lyrically, musically, and...just get it!

Spirit In The Night<br />9. Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street?<br />10. Santa Ana<br />11. Tokyo<br />12. Thundercrack<br /><br />By mid 1972 the rock landscape was looking decidedly dull. The search for a new Beatles or a new Dylan to re-unite the Woodstock generation and their younger siblings had come to nothing and the natives were getting restless. So when word began to filter through of new-kid-on-the-block Bruce Springsteen breaking out of home city Asbury Park, New Jersey, and playing shows nationwide that reconfirmed audiences faith in the redemptive power of rock n roll, hope began to restore. Bruce had signed a recording deal with Columbia in mid-72 and had been working on his debut record since. Greetings From Asbury Park saw the light of day in early 73, and within the week Springsteen, with a little help from three of the soon to be named East Street Band, were performing their first ever radio broadcast, aired on Boston s WBCN FM. A quite remarkable performance ensued with Bruce and the boys in excellent humour and fine form as they played a terrific set, although remarkably including just one cut from Greetings. The show was an intimate affair without an audience but gave listeners their first glimpse into Springsteen s infectious personality, enormous enthusiasm and unique sense of humour. It also drove home the message that here was an artist who could prove to be the new messiah, with songs that quite beggared belief. The second show featured on this disc is Bruce s very first broadcast from the Main Point venue in Bryn Mawr, just outside Philadelphia - the venue at which Bruce s most prestigious and highly regarded broadcast was made, the astonishing 1975 gig that has also recently been released. This April 1973 set differs widely from the January 73 show as the full band (drummer Vini Lopez joins proceedings) rock out, and comparisons with the largely acoustic Boston broadcast remain fascinating. That was pretty good, Bruce is heard to mutter as the final track of this broadcast draws to a close - providing the perfect understatement for the burgeoning talent heard maturing in these two broadcasts, and equally for the shows themselves, as just one listen to this remarkable CD will testify.edings) rock out, and comparisons with the largely acoustic Boston broadcast remain fascinating.

B000H6SXLU|4.0|So head designer Stephanie (Irene Dunne) declares indignantly regarding the couture salon of that name.  In my view, this sentiment can be applied to this film that shares the same title.  It's first-rate entertainment, sheer escapism for a 1935 Depression audience to laugh and forget their troubles.  For modern audiences, it's a fascinating glimpse back into a long gone era in film.  Among it's pleasures the enchanting, soigné Irene Dunne, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in their third film together cementing their hold on the movie going public, a melodious Jerome Kern score, a handsome stalwart leading man Randolph Scott, art deco inspired sets and a cavalcade of chic creations on some very alluring mannequins, including a baby faced blonde Lucille Ball in one of her earliest screen appearances.    The story, John Kent (Randolph Scott) a former college football star accompanies his best buddy Huck Haines and his band the Wabash Indians to an engagement in Paris.  While there he stops to visit his favorite Aunt Minnie (Helen Westley) who owns and operates a very chic couture house that goes by the moniker \\"Roberta\\".  Although Aunt Minnie's spirits are youthful, she is elderly and in poor health.  These days the creative talent behind \\"Roberta\\" is her head designer and assistant a beautiful White Russian princess called Stephanie (Irene Dunne).  One of \\"Roberta's\\" clients a temperamental European countess (Ginger Rogers) turns out in fact to be an old acquaintance of Huck's, an American singer and dancer Lizzie Gatz.  Huck and Lizzie renew their friendship, and she helps get the band a booking at the nightclub where she performs.  In the meantime Aunt Minnie and Stephanie work on polishing the rough edges on John with some success, in the process Stephanie and John begin to fall in love.  Suddenly Aunt Minnie dies of a heart attack leaving \\"Roberta\\" to John.  Since he knows nothing about running a dressmaking establishment, John persuades Stephanie to be his partner.  However a snake turns up in their paradise, when John's ex fiancée a calculating, snide young socialite Sophie Teale (Claire Dodd) shows up in Paris and makes a beeline for \\"Roberta\\" and him.    Regrettably, Irene Dunne doesn't stand as highly as she should nowadays, but she was a treasure in the films of the 1930's and 1940's, equally adept at comedy or drama and could sing as well in a trained soprano voice that she uses here for three of Jerome Kern's best numbers, \\"Yesterdays\\", \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" and \\"Lovely to Look at\\", and by the way she certainly was in this.  And with her patrician air of quiet good breeding you can certainly believe she was born a princess.   In this third pairing together you can see just how much the Astaire/Rogers partnership is blossoming into something spectacular.  Each brings the best out in the other.  \\"I'll Be Hard to Handle\\", their first number together, has a loose, improvisational feel, as they trade steps together.  The highlight is the dance to the accompaniment of \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\", which is just wonderful, very romantic, both impeccable, he is white tails, she in gleaming black satin with a beautiful arch to her back.  Astaire has a great solo with \\"I Won't Dance\\", his feet flashing like the winged Mercury's.  Besides their skill in tripping the light fantastic, both are quite funny here, particularly Rogers with her ersatz continental accent.    Of the quartet of leading players, Randolph Scott comes off as the least effective but in his defense, as written it's a pretty conventional leading man role, basically it calls for a strapping good looking guy to romance the heroine and Scott fills the bill.  In minor roles, Helen Westley has a down to earth coziness as Aunt Minnie and Claire Dodd as the nasty Sophie is attractive but has a smug set to her mouth and a hard glitter in her eye that make her an ideal villainess.   Jerome Kern's score was adapted from the Broadway hit of the same title, with the addition of some new numbers written for the film, the best of which are \\"Lovely to Look At\\" and \\"I Won't Dance.\\"  While not Kern's best score, it's still a winner and Irene Dunne and Fred Astaire who share the lion's share of the songs, do full justice to it.   Two of the most impressive features are the sets by art director Carroll Clark and set dresser Thomas A. Little and the gowns by designer Bernard Newman.  The sleek, settings evoke the art deco period so popular at that time, and the gowns are very glamorous, probably Hollywood's version of haute couture, but they are believable as Parisian originals.  Both Irene Dunne and Ginger Rogers look very desirable in form fitting gleaming satin evening gowns, Dunne in a deceptively high necked clingy white version, while Rogers sizzles in a low cut slinky black model. In the fashion show sequence it was a pleasure for me as a man to see models who looked groomed and sophisticated, possessing poise and elegance in their carriage that in fact were lovely to look at.  This was quite a refreshing change when contrasted against some of atrociously dressed sullen cadavers who clomp and flounce down the fashion runways these days.  As I mentioned Lucille Ball is one of the models in the fashion show, she's almost unrecognizable, she wears a white feathered gown and has platinum curls.  However she does get a close up, and you can see it's her, so watch for it.   This is not a holiday film, but certainly is fun to watch during the holidays, Turner Classic Movies ran it once on New Year's Day some years ago, and Thanksgiving Day the year before last, but it's charms work anytime.  Try it and see, as it originally did with it's weary Depression audiences, it will lift your spirits and put a smile on your face.

B002W5UVSM|5.0|Ignatius Reilly is one of the most unusual and truly unique characters I have come across in novels.  Exceedingly obese, self-centered, disengaged from society by choice, hygienically-challenged.....this is not the typical protagonist a reader would pull for.  But, there is something very appealing about this corpulent and unfashionably dressed man from New Orleans that keeps the reader's attention.  Like a terrible wreck on the highway that you can't turn away from and secretly hope to see carnage, this is a man you just can't turn away from no matter how loathsome he gets.<br /><br />  Whether he is musing on his preference to be a Negro (this is the 1960's) and not have the white man's burden of struggling to attain a place in the misguided middle class, leading factory workers in open revolt, inventing a new filing system, or pushing a hot dog cart through the French Quarter, Ignatius commands your attention.<br /><br />Whether this is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy is debatable, but one thing is certain:  you will find yourself laughing out loud on just about every page.  The author's clever use of language, the well-defined secondary characters, and the pure genius of the tale itself leaves you thinking about Ignatius and his mom long after the book is read.<br /><br />Brimming with the local color of New Orleans, the author fills the reader's mind with images from the underbelly of that city, its more unsavory characters, and the dens of ill repute that made it famous.  Only once in his life did Ignatius leave the city and that was on an ill-fated bus ride to Baton Rouge, or as Ignatius likes to call it in his many retellings of his misadventure, \\"the whirlpool of despair\\".<br /><br />Because of a mistaken arrest which leads to his mother's heavy drinking and subsequent car accident, Ignatius is forced to get a job.  And that is when the fun really begins.<br />His Ivy League education has not prepared him for anything other than lying around the house, critiquing American Bandstand, and making demands of his haggard mom.  However, when money is desperately needed, Mama tells him to get out of the house and get a job or else.<br /><br />His comic misadventures at Levy's Pants and later as a hot dog vendor on the streets of the French Quarter are hysterically funny.  Miss Trixie, the befuddled septuagenarian who only wants to retire, Gonzalez the conscientious office manager, Darlene the stripper who wants to be a star, Jones the janitor who only works to avoid jail, and the incompetent but dedicated Officer Mancuso enter and exit Ignatius' life and all come together in the end to insure a surprisingly logical conclusion for Ignatius.emands of his haggard mom.

B0034G4P4O|4.0|For those brought up on these characters, this film succeeds in bringing the viewer into their world:  small town France, with the plucky reporter and his faithful dog, who get into wild adventures in the big world outside with Captain Haddock, the alcoholic who perpetually falls off the wagon.  The film follows The Secret of the Unicorn closely, but makes a number of small plot changes - I mention this because aficionados of the books will have memorized every single scene.  The changes do not detract from the story.<br /><br />The characterizations are pretty good, though Tintin's face is often curiously devoid of emotion.  As the adventure moves quickly, the viewer can forget about Tintin's lack of character, but it was an occasional annoyance.  Haddock is much better:  the film definitely captures his essential mix of buffoonery, courage, and purity of spirit; he is very funny, always the more delightful character than the ernest and wholesome Tintin, so perhaps that is why he has more life to him.  The other characters are also more vividly drawn than Tintin, from Thompson and Thompson to the many bad guys like Red Rackam.  For the most part, the animation, atmosphere, and action are spectacular, so clear as to be indistinguishable from film.<br /><br />My kids enjoyed this as much as I did.  We saw it in French, its original language, so I cannot comment on voice characterizations for an American audience.  Warmly recommended as good fun.  We will definitely buy it when the price is right.

B004EPYZTE|2.0|If you are a fan of the real Conan The Barbarian with Arnie in his youth, then this movie falls very short!!! It is Conan by name only. My opinion of this movie solely on its own merits still isn't pleasant! It's crappyness is equal to that of \\"The Beastmaster\\". Plot is weak, acting is sup-par, and all in all it feels like \\"The Scorpion King\\" without the Rock! There was no empathy for any of the characters, it does little to explain who the title character is or how he got to be where he is. I know it is supposed to be a mindlessly entertaining movie - not an Oscar contender - and it does get the mindless part down. It the entertaining part that is missing! Do yourself a favor: Red Box or rent this before you consider buying it.
1400069181|4.0|As a new fan and owner of TOMS shoes, I was already intrigued and wanted to know more about the TOMS story and how it all began. This book tells the whole story, start to present, in a quick, interesting chapter. It goes on to give advice on starting your own similar venture and includes stories of other charitable ventures. The book is well organized and is easily accessible in the sense you know where it is taking you. The thing about this book that stood out the most to me was how simple it was to read. If you're looking for an easy read to take on a short trip, this is the book for you. I read it in two evenings, and it's not written in a way that is difficult to absorb.   That being said, the book sometimes feels a little redundant. Some stories are reverenced several times, and you won't be forgetting that the author is the creator of TOMS shoes, even though the book tries to lead the reader in different directions, which I was really interested in reading more of. Really, though, that was understandable and didn't keep me from getting the message of the book or enjoying it any less.  That was the only thing I didn't love about the book; I really did enjoy this reading, and I was strongly moved by many of the examples of the work TOMS has done, and other companies such as charity: water and FEED that Mycoskie references. I often even felt a little lump suddenly appear in my through when he told specific examples of their charity work.  After setting this book down, I found myself dreaming about starting something that matters myself. The author is really an advocate for change and helping people see how simple and easy it can be, and I was left feeling like I could do anything. That emotion is one that I can really appreciate and want to share with other people. And even though the book's examples were sometimes redundant, it made a point to show how often it does work and how simply it can be accomplished, and proved it with example after example. It also further illustrated the author's point of simplicity, because it didn't have to have bunch of elaborate examples to get the point across, it just referenced the same simple ones. My favorite chapter of the book was Build Trust, where Mycoskie gives \\"insider's\\" tips on how to build trust on different levels with both internal and external connections that I know have value and truth to them, because of the the success of his business.  If there is any interest in all about starting a similar venture, or just to read about some successes, this book is a great choice. It doesn't take a huge investment of time, and it really is an inspiring read.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|I am looking forward to buying this Blu Ray immediately upon its release. If you are all about mindless action, blood, gore, etc... then avoid this film. If you are into human stories with action as the back-drop, then this is the movie for you. This is basically \\"Stand By Me\\" meets \\"Goonies\\" meets \\"Alien\\". The story was great, the acting, direction, and even the plot were superb. It is only towards the end that the movie shifts into the standard formula of action without intelligent thought. I know alien films require a certain suspension of belief, but this kinda goes to extremes.  All in all, it is a very good movie. Definately worth checking out!

B002BWP49C|4.0|I see some people criticizing this movie, but the movie is what it is supposed to be - a romance (for the most part)with much angst.  The Twilight books aren't great literature, they are fun stories that tickle our imagination.  I am an early fifties female who LOVES movies and books.  I attended the movie with my husband who has not seen all the previous films and has not read the books. He thought the movie was a bit slow and didn't understand much of it(as expected)but he didn't HATE it.  If you haven't read the books (written in the narrative with much of Bella's dialog being her thoughts)then you probably won't like the movie as well and won't understand parts of it very well.  I thought for the most part they followed the book and kept the pace moving as well as can be expected since the first half of the book is fairly slow paced as an extended honeymoon and subsequent pregnancy should be. Bella's pregnancy is not as drawn out as in the book and I believe the birth scene was done pretty well considering how gory it would be if the book was followed exactly, let alone the nudity.  I thought Renesmee was adorable and looked like a real baby.  I would highly recommend this movie to fans of the book. Will it be nominated for Oscars? No, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun and a nice fantasy escape for a couple hours.  I do think the acting has improved greatly from the first movie.  I think the wolves have improved too. The wedding was beautiful - go Alice. I am looking forward to the next part.

B0019X3ZZY|3.0|1944 in Northern Italy, a town called Salo is controlled by Nazis and fascists and 16 teenagers have been kidnapped. The teens including 4 middle aged women are forced to sexual abuse, metal torture, physical torture and to be killed for the pleasures of the libertines.<br /><br />Absolutely horrifying, stomach churning and disturbing as hell Italian/French horror-drama import from controversial director Pier Paolo Pasolini is his final film and has been one of the most controversial films of all time since 1975. I gotta say the director was trying to be artistic and made the infamous novel set to WWII during fascist nazi ruled Italy. This film contains some shocking images of mental torture, graphic torture like the climax which is guaranteed to make someone faint, feces eating, rape and all the excess to make one physically sick and there is a few sexual situations in all 3 things such as heterosexuality, bisexuality and homosexuality. But i do believe this movie does have a political nature to it including being metaphorical on the days of fascism in WWII Italy, the film doesn't know that it's either art or trash. Think of it as being like \\"Schindler's List\\" only more screwed up in the head.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD set includes 3 documentaries, interview interviews and the theatrical trailer including Italian in subtitles and English dub versions. This movie is just meant to shock audiences despite some interesting ideas and guaranteed to make one take a shower after seeing it.
B002XUL6RG|5.0|Steve R. McQueen's harrowing and unforgettable film about the final weeks of the 1981 Hunger Strike in Long Kesh HM Prison Maze led by Irish patriot and PIRA volunteer Robert Gerard \\"Bobby\\" Sands is nothing short of a tragic masterpiece from start to finish. Michael Fassbender's portrayal of the ill-fated Sands is beyond exceptional and the movie is filmed in a grim, quiet fashion that appropriately suits the mood of the atmosphere of this important true event. In one gripping long scene, Sands converses and argues with visiting Belfast priest Father Dominic Moran (Liam Cunningham). An unmoving camera is trained upon these two protagonists for what must be nearly half an hour, as Sands reveals his plan for a new hunger strike and defends his methods of achieving political goals, ultimately berating what he sees as the priest's despondency and inertia. This is art with a capital A. The pace, at times snail-like, allows you consider in real detail the situation these men found themselves in. The overall triumph of the film is that it makes no judgements but does not sit on the fence - it invokes the viewer to do that themselves. It really is quite remarkable that Mr. McQueen can achieve this so consistently.<br /><br />'Hunger' will no-doubt be traumatic for some, however, it remains as one of the most utterly compelling pieces of cinema I have ever seen about one of the most important figures in Irish history.
B001DF68MA|4.0|My boy is on the upper end of the size chart for this seat so that is definitely a factor so anything I say that is less than flattering. It is conceptually great. I love the idea and my boy definitely likes it. It is comfortable for him, less so for me, but that is in part because of my aforementioned caveat.   I had to raise my seat up all the way for full leg extension and power. I can't stand up to peddle because it knocks the kid on the back of the head.   Balance and weight distribution are great. Kid experience is great. Installation and adjustment are pretty easy. I want to love it but I can't. If you start using it earlier than I did, I think you can love it.   It is easier than holding your child in one arm and riding with him on your hip though; that is for sure.

B0042X9L6A|5.0|The SB-700 is a great flash for my purposes. The SB-900 was overkill with meager greater performance at a much greater price. Do your research to see if the flash if right for you and compare prices. I didn't find much leeway in the price but the Nikon quality is superb.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This biography is likely to be polarizing amongst those who read it with preconceived notions on Steve Jobs.  I came away feeling more respectful of Apple and less respectful of Jobs.  He was indeed a genius, but he was also uncommonly flawed.  He possessed an alarming and cultivated cruelty that I'm afraid his successes will show as an acceptable model of management.  He was extremely adept at the art of manipulation.  I'm sure arm-chair psychologists will all have their own theories as to his mental issues... I know I had mine.  Whatever the case, it's clear that he was a visionary and a leader in the school of thought which is design-first.  I was continually impressed with his focus on refining the user-experience into something beautifully simple.  At times, I was exasperated over his obsession over things like paint color of factory machinery or the position of elevators in a brand new building (he had them moved).  Yet, in those stories you see that for Jobs, the design and aesthetic matter infinitely... and that he believes many others just don't get it and produce inferior products as a result.  More often than not, he was right.  Another topic that Isaacson touches on (but doesn't promote as a first-class quality) is that Jobs was a fantastic negotiator.  Whether it was with Pixar vs. Disney or Apple engaging the music industry... when he's on equal or similar footing, he wins.  The lone exceptions are when he was being forced out of Apple, in which he's unraveling before our eyes.  Isaacson does a superb job showing how Jobs could vacillate between understanding what was best for the company to swinging towards subversion and attempting to form a coup.  Isaacson also does a lovely job comparing the closed, end-to-end experience of the Apple philosophy with the open and less-controlled mindset of Microsoft and Google.  It's a fascinating debate, both from a historical capacity as well as the future of computing.  Isaacson is able to convey an extremely powerful interview with Jobs and Bill Gates... each reflecting on the open/closed approach, which model has excelled and why, and where they describe the areas to which they respect their rival.  It was, by far, the most interesting interview in the book.  Gates clearly respects Jobs and his efforts.  He often seems amazed at Jobs' ability to continue to surprise.  Jobs is respectful and praising of Gates, if only temporarily.  Lastly, Isaacson delves into Jobs genius of marketing.  To this, there can be no debate.  Jobs early on knows that he must have consumer impute a high value to an Apple product.  He so cleverly manages to do this with balancing the free-spirit revolutionary mindset with that of pure consumerism.  It's fascinating, and Isaacson does a superb job of getting granular in the retelling of certain campaigns or presentations.  I am glad that this book was written to show \\"warts and all\\" and that Jobs, to his credit, allowed it to go forward.  It's a very compelling read.  I particularly enjoyed the sections on the early days of Apple... a truly fascinating time, filled with so much promise.
1439156816|4.0|I write a lot.<br />I read a lot.<br />But I don't generally read stuff by Stephen King. I am not a rabid fan. I can't do \\"Cujo\\"-type books.<br /><br />So when I saw that he'd written something nonfiction I was delighted.<br />Ten pages into this book I was more than delighted. I was as entertained by this little book as I have ever been by any work of fiction.<br /><br />What a wonderful look at the formative bits and pieces that have gone into making Stephen King the writer he is today---the autobiographical snapshots we get of King as a boy and young adult are priceless. Just priceless. Eavesdropping on his sensible (but quirky) thoughts about creative writing made it hard to put the book down. He spares himself (and others) nothing and his bald honesty, well put, led me to read this book all in one day.<br /><br />King tells us that it's his reading, writing and perseverance that have made him what he is today. But, good writer that he is, he also SHOWS us that it takes uncommmon powers of observation as well.<br /><br />This isn't a book only for wannabe writers or King fans, it's just a darn good book that anybody can enjoy.

B005AUWY90|3.0|This Cars 2 sequel is not like the first.  It is NOT FOR TODDLERS.  Maybe for children maybe 8+.  We pre-ordered Cars 2 for our 2.5 yrs old who is obsessed with Cars (the first one) and watched it once.  It is way too violent with way too much guns and shooting.  We will be putting this away until he is much older.  The movie itself is good...just not for younger children.

B004FOA84A|5.0|You know this is a really good game because people in other reviews keep saying \\"it's too short\\" - which means they liked Grisly Manor so much they wished there were more of it.  My tip #1 take your time playing Grisly Manor and enjoy it.  Solving the puzzles is fun and gives you that \\"ah ha!\\" moment when you figure out the harder ones.  My tip #2:  avoid \\"walk-through\\" web sites.  How lame is it to follow instructions on a web site then to complain that the game was not longer?  Using someone else's cheat sheet makes anythIng go by too quickly.  Check out Fire Maple's \\"The Lost City\\" game also-it's like Grisly Manor but better.
B005M92MJ6|5.0|I am a huge fan of Maynard from Tool and APC. Maynard's newest project Puscifer has been a great alternative to get my Maynard fix since it's been so long for a new Tool and APC CD. Conditions of my parole is more then a alternative for my 2 favorite bands, it has now pushed Puscifer to the top of my list. This is by far the best Puscifer CD and rivals a lot of his work with APC and Tool. If you are a fan of Maynard's work you must buy this CD, it's truly an amazing CD. I am so happy they are coming to DC for this CD tour! I can't wait to see them!

1451627289|3.0|Reviewers of 11.22.63, Stephen King's story of a time-travelling teacher hoping to prevent John F Kennedy's assassination, have fallen into two camps: those unfazed by the novel's length, and those who found it the main reason to berate him and his apparently inert editor. In the latter group were the Observer's Rachel Cooke (\\"a self-indulgent book that is too long ... too complicated, and too barmy for words\\"), the Sunday Times's John Dugdale (\\"a bloated effort that seems based on a gross miscalculation of the reader's patience\\") and the Evening Standard's David Sexton (\\"vastly too long ... it could better have been a suggestive novella\\"), with the Financial Times's Adam Lebor mildly pointing out that King's status means \\"he can write as much as he wants about whatever he likes without, it sometimes seems, an editor's critical eye\\". However, Roz Kaveney lauded King's \\"charm\\" in his \\"fierce new novel\\" in the Independent, and in the New York Times the filmmaker Errol Morris declared it \\"one of the best time-travel stories since HG Wells\\".  [...]
1451627289|5.0|I absolutely loved this book; actually, I loved his past two books.  This book really shines in King's character development.  Yes, some people have an issue with the middle third of the book, but I enjoyed every bit of it.  If you think about it, it's his craft at getting us to understand/empathsize with his charaters actions and emotions that make the ending so emotionally impactful.  When I put the book down it was really hard not to feel a connection with the main character and what he had gone through.  It's not unlike the feeling I got when watching the Shawshank Redepmtion movie ending (and yes, I do know that is a movie ending) and parts of The Green Mile as well.  There is also a short story in Nightmares and Dreamscapes I believe is called Head Down (baseball...)that reminds me of what I felt reading 11/22/63.  I didn't want this book to end.  Ad naseum King is unfairly typecast into being a horror writer.  When I tell my friends I am reading the new King book they immediately respond with \\"Is it scary?\\".  Well, I have to remind them that King started out in the horror/thriller genre, but there are many examples that showcase his exemplary storytelling:  Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Under the Dome,.....and now this one.  I hope that this book can convert a few new King fans.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the entire book in one sitting, yes it was that good. I had put off reading the book because I thought there was to much hype. But the book exceeded my expectation. Keep a box of Kleenex nearby you may need them during several of the tense scenes. This story is a keeper!

0761158820|4.0|This book has 50 paper monsters that you punch out, fold and glue. My five year old and seven year old had a blast putting these together with the help of their dad. My seven year old could put some of the easier monsters together almost all by himself but the five year old needed a lot of help with all the monsters he put together.<br /><br />The book recommends using glue to adhere the tabs together but that requires patience to hold the tabs together while the glue dries before moving on the next step. Since patience is not a virtue my boys have mastered, they used scotch tape. The monsters still turned out looking just fine.<br /><br />This book is great to pull out on a rainy day to have fun projects to work on with your kids.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have been a John Grisham fan ever since I can remember...unfortunately, it has been a number of years since he has written something that has been worth reading. In The Litigators, Grisham does just that. I literally could not put it down. I am hoping this is a sign that Grisham is back! So, if you liked the early Grisham books (The Firm, Pelican Brief, etc), you will absolutely LOVE The Litigators!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I have seen multiple comments on posts in Amazon regarding the strength of people's WIFI system.  I have found this great APP named WIFI Analyzer that is free and it is a great tool.  It offers multiple screens that can provide an analysis of your WIFI strength as well as all the WIFI systems around your house.  It provides sound engineering data on how well your network is performing.  It will even tell you which channels are the most open and best for you to choose as well as the signal strength of your network and all others:<br /><br />Screen 1 is a WIFI spectrum analyzer map showing all the area networks (including yours) and what bands they are using and the signal strength.  My WIFI booms at -45 to -55 DB ( a very good signal strength) all over my house and yard and it allows very fast and good access.<br /><br />Screen 2 gives you an analog meter that will provide you with accurate strength readings of your WIFI.<br /><br />Screen 3 provides a bar graph of your network and all of the surrounding networks and their signal strength.<br /><br />Screen 4 tells you which channel you are on and which channels in your area provide the best open reception so you can reprogram your wireless router and improve your WIFI performance.<br /><br />Screen 5 provides signal strength versus time recording so you can monitor your WIFI to make sure it is stable and if any neighbor is walking on your WIFI.<br /><br />This APP is a great tool and allows you to walk around your home and monitor your signal strength and look for dead zones and problem areas where other WIFI systems may be causing you trouble.  It can even help you aim and align your WIFI antenna for optimum performance.  I would strongly suggest you try this APP.  You can stop the guess work and use this APP on your Kindle Fire to check out your WIFI with a real measuring tool.
B005F3XV62|3.0|Although this movie is appealing to a young audience with the talking animals it really is not a movie that is appropriate for young children.  There were many parts that older children or adults would find funny but I do not think these are things that a young child should here...especially if he/she is a child to repeat things later.  This movie should probably have been rated PG-13 not PG.

B0015T6G2G|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I love the way it follows the timeline from Mr. Mandela's childhood on up. You really get to see how the child was molded into the man and then into the President of South Africa. It doesn't skip over any of the bad times and yet doesn't flaunt the bad times either -it doesn't turn into a 'horror' story. The story of South Africa's battle from Apartheid rule to the independent 'One Man One Vote' - no matter the colour, race, religion etc.- taking the country out of the stone-age and into modern times. This in no way is a finished product. The hard times in South Africa continues, but it takes you on the journey of one man who made a fantastic, heroic difference...
B003EYVXTQ|4.0|Bleak, but not to the point of heart breaking, Winter's Bone offers a seemingly realistic and dark journey into the southern drug community. The rednecks in this film are not as over the top as the ones found in Deliverance, which makes them all the more believable and terrifying. This is mostly due to the great dead-eyed performance done by the entire cast. Everyone does a perfect job in their roles, with Lawrence and Hawkes shining particularly bright more then likely due to having the juiciest roles.  The cinematography uses grey tones to really bring out the gritty feel that permeates virtually every location shot. The music fits well, though not particularly memorable (probably not the point of it). As I said, Lawrence gives a great performance, but I think she often looks too good to be mixed up with everyone else. Too clean and pretty.   The story is slow paced, which is perfectly fine since it's still captivating, but some of the plot threads seem to be lost throughout the film. No, I'm not talking about the ending (which was very well done), but some of the alliances and relationships were a bit vague. Still, it's easy to see why this was nominated for best picture, as it's defiantly worth watching and will probably stay with you for at least a little while after viewing.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I was hesitant to read GRRM's fourth installation of his series after reading some of the negative reviews here on Amazon. But after reading the first three and enjoying them, I went ahead and purchased the Feast for Crows (only way to get to book 5 anyways). While I will agree that the pace and excitement was not quite up to the  standard set by the previous books in the series, I still rated it a 4 out of 5 stars. If you think of book 4 as sort of a \\"lull\\" between books 1-3 and book 5 or a book that fills in or adds more history/detail to the world, you'll have no problem with it. If you go in expecting a book to top the previous 3, then you'll probably be saddened...but just like a Lannister and his debts, I expect GRRM will repay us all in book 5 :)
1451648537|5.0|I loved the book, and it's especially close to home with me as I live just a few miles from where all of this happened. So, just one more thing...an important one in a book so otherwise detailed. What happened to Steve's adoptive father, Paul?? His adoptive mom's  death (Clara) is mentioned as is his bedside visits with her near the end of her life. But his dad, whom he loved very much, just drops off the end of the planet. How could this omission be allowed or overlooked by an author who took great pains to detail everything about Steve from where he ate to where he got his famous turtlenecks? Odd......

B0057R5XRG|3.0|Long time fan of all three JP movies. Yes, you heard me correctly, I said all THREE.   I just got my box set in the mail today. Put \\"Jurassic Park\\" in my Blu ray player and watched in amazement at the first five minutes or so of beautiful hi-definition JP. Then came the \\"ride\\" that Hammond shows off the introductory stage of the dinosaur development process. My eyes nearly bled from the dreadful quality. Ok, so maybe my eyes weren't going to bleed, but regardless, the picture was hideous. The blacks in the outer shadows glimmered with noise. You heard me, GLIMMERED. I thought I was watching Twilight for a moment and realized something, how the hell do you go from pristine quality to a noise-glimmering abomination? This film repeats these mistakes twelve or fifteen times throughout the movie. You get a nice run of defining textures and popping colors, and suddenly you find yourself staring at overly noisy film and/or sparkling blacks with the shadows.   The audio was booming on my 32\\" Samsung and I only had the volume at 6! The extras are, in my opinion, great insight into the behind-the-scenes of filming such a classic movie. But, as you can tell, I'm upset overall for being \\"shafted\\" with this purchase. I paid nearly $50 for this Blu ray set and it is a flawed transfer. I can almost see my money being taken from me with a snickering Steven lurking in the noise-filled shadows. For some inexplicable reason I feel like Universal will re-release this box set with a \\"corrected\\" transfer so the studio can reap in millions more. I truly feel suckered. I heard the \\"Gladiator\\" transfer was initially quite a terrible quality Blu ray (so I heard) but people got suckered into getting that. A little while after the release, BAM! A new and MUCH better release came out. The worst is I can't get my money back because I've already taken off this packaging, I can't return the set and wait for a better transfer...  Please, Steven, for all of us filmgoers out here, don't do this to \\"Jaws\\" and \\"Indiana Jones.\\" I can't be having to wait three more years for those to come out, be [insert profanity] transfers, and wait until the \\"good\\" copies are available.  Can I haz my monies back, plez?

B00003CXTG|5.0|Visually Stunning!  It's why we go to the movies.  Made me feel like I was there.  >>I especially like that it shows the bravery and competence of the women who served as well, and they are seen getting medals of honor too.  A real breakthrough in war movie-storytelling, if you ask me.<<<br /><br />I cannot understand why the critics did not like this movie.  I think it's excellent. Superb cinematically, writing, acting, editing, sets, costumes, etc., etc.<br />[It's also the last movie filmed in Wide-Screen Technicolor and it doesn't get any better than that.]<br /><br />How anyone can say it's not accurate is beyond me too, as so much was happening at that moment in history, everyone had a different angle, a different point of view, a different experience.<br />**I read it was screened for surviving WWII vets who found it very realistic, down to the bullet holes on the tarmac that are said to be still visible today.<br /><br />Of course the movie's characters are fictitious, as they are a conglomerate of peoples' lives at that time and place.  The stars and costars did an excellent job of bringing me into their personal stories. *I HIGHLY Recommend it.<br /><br />** If you're going to purchase this movie, I'd suggest getting an anniversary edition such as this, as the movie merits it.  You may find yourself interested in how it was done, so you may want the extra features usually found in these types of packages.

Devastated Cal turns to a bar where he meets Jacob (Gosling) a young ladies man who tries to help Cal through the tough times. When Cal learns to be like Jacob he still feels like his life is missing something. Every once in a while a \\"chick flick\\" comes along that I really enjoy as much as my girlfriend. This is one of them. The cast alone is enough reason to watch it, but this is a comedy with a lot of heart and I think would be good no matter who was in it. Carell and Moore do a great job and Gosling is very funny to watch. This is a movie that is pretty predictable from the beginning, but is still a very enjoyable movie to watch and keeps you interested the entire time. I highly recommend this one. Overall, a great movie that men, not just women will enjoy. I give it an A-.<br /><br />*Also try - Dan In Real Life & In Good Company
B0068G6M8E|5.0|This series has managed to keep me on the edge of my seat actually angry that I have to wait until the next episode airs the following week. Not many shows are able to get that kind of an emotional response from me. The show is outstanding and gets better with time like a bottle of fine wine! Kudos to the entire staff and crew of \\"Sons of Anarchy\\", I love watching it and I am counting down to the start of this weeks episode. Jim Morey from Dalton, Massachusetts.
B005NQ94KS|4.0|\\"If we can't talk to each other then what is the point of us?\\" While their friends are having fun and wind up leaving them alone Emma (Hathaway) and Dexter (Sturgis) begin a friendship that grows over time. This movie follows the two on the date of July 15th from 1978 to 2011. Each year on that day the meet each other and catch up with each other. This is a definite \\"chick-flick\\" type movie but I did actually enjoy this. The movie starts off and grabs you and keeps you interested for the entire time, even though it tends to drag quite a bit in the the middle. The last half hour though makes you glad that you continued to watch and made it till the end. The movie, while being good has the type of ending that sticks with you and makes you think long after it's over. This movie has the feel of \\"Atonement\\" so if you enjoy movies like that then this will be one for you. Overall, a definite chick flick that some guys may like, or at least I think so. I also may be the only one. I give it a B+.<br /><br />*Also try - Last Night & Atonement
B006AX6ONI|5.0|It's worth the money. That said, I've read his blog front to back a couple of times (major MC fan) and there wasn't anything really new. He throws in a couple of pictures and, thankfully, lets some people edit his posts, but that's about it. If you want to read this book for free, just pull up blogmaverick.<br /><br />If you feel like throwing MC a couple of bucks and getting a little bit of fresh content, buy it. The last part of the book is the best, because he summarizes stuff that he wrote about in longer blog posts. He gets to the core of his message there.<br /><br />It's not an autobiography; he's not talking about how he was born in Pennsylvania. It's all about how he thinks about stuff, but I hesitate to call it a book on his philosophy.<br /><br />TL;DR It's worth the money. Buy it.

All grown up and battle tested, Conan (Momoa) grabs his sword and begins his quest to find and kill Khalar Zim.  I will begin by saying that I have never really been a fan of these huge epic battle oriented movies.  Also unlike most people my age who grew up and watched the original over and over I never really \\"got it\\".  Lately with all the remakes coming out I have been trying to watch the originals either again or for the first time.  What I have found by watching the original \\"Arthur\\" and \\"Fright Night\\" is that I thought they were OK.  After watching the new ones I realized how much better they were then the new ones.  This version of Conan is a lot like that.  Remembering scenes from the original and comparing them really made me appreciate the original more and more.  By the end (much like the other ones I mentioned) I viewed the originals in a different and better light.  All that said, again I am not really a fan of these movies so a huge fan may like this much more then I did.  Overall, unless you are a fan of this type of genre I would stick with the original.  I give it a B-.<br /><br />*Also try - Eagle & Troy
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a fairly mindless \\"puzzle\\" game where you have to figure out how to get the candy to the pet monster. Most of the levels are pretty easy to beat with one star but many are very challenging to get 3 stars on. There were a few levels where I never did figure out how to get 3 stars. My son was able to beat the game pretty quickly by advancing to the next level after every completion. I tried to get 3 stars for each level so it took me a lot longer. Either way is fun.  I would actually rate this as a 4.5 stars because it is not in my top few favorite games ever but I liked it a lot.
B0019N94X6|5.0|Last year I gave my wife the [[ASIN:B0000AMRJE Scarface Deluxe Gift Set - Scarface (1983) & Scarface (1932)]] as a Christmas gift.  To my surprise, she wasn't that pleased.  I pointed out that this item included the Limited Edition Tony Montana money clip, she scoffed at it.<br /><br />So I said: \\"Hey baby what is your problem? Huh, you got a problem?\\"  She just stormed off.<br /><br />Then I hit on what the problem was.  She wanted Blu-Ray.<br /><br />So this year it's Say Hello to my Little Friend in 7.1, baby.<br /><br />(I used her CC to pay for it just in case).
0887081770|2.0|I was disappointed when I received this book in the mail. I ordered two of Eric Carle's books from this vendor and while they were delivered in a timely fashion that I was pleased with, they were definitely not what I expected. Instead of being the regular sized, hardback books that I see at Books-A-Million or Barnes and Noble, they are miniature versions of the books and they are tiny. I planned to give a set of the Eric Carle books to my nephew for Christmas, but now I am going to have to go out and purchase more books that are a normal size because he hates tiny books. He likes to see the big, pretty pictures. I am very frustrated and hate that I wasn't given an accurate description of the size of the books before making my purchase.
B005ORVMT2|4.0|I'm thrilled Rush finally has a box set. I've been waiting for Rush to announce a box set for years. I preordered all three (Sector 1,2,3) the moment they were announced.   My review is broken down in two parts. The audio quality of the content and the boxset packaging.   From an audio quality prospective, these are probably the best sounding versions available. Especially the DVD Audio versions of Fly by Night, Farewell to Kings and Signals. As for packaging and quality of the artwork, I compared the mini-lp's to my Japanese SHM mini-lp imports. I own most of these albums in the SHM version so I was able to side by side comparisons of the artwork and packaging.   Unfortunately, the Sector mini lp artwork pales in comparison to the SHM Japanese import. The Sector mini lp's felt like cheap Chinese copies of the SHM version. The SHM mini lp's have a high quality look and feel with covers sporting a glossy finish with vibrant colors and the card stock has a nice quality feel and weight to them. The printed artwork on the physical CD's looks very much like the original LP (including the colors and details.) On the other hand, the Sector cover art was matted with a very light, cheap feeling cardboard. The CD artwork looked similar to some of the original LP artwork but had a \\"first draft\\" feel. Other CD's (like Hemispheres)did not match the original vinyl artwork at all.   I will say, although the Sector packing was lower in quality as compared to the SHM version, there is cost to consider. The SHM CD's cost approximately $40- $50- per CD vs $42 for 5 CD's + DVD Audio. That's 5 times the cost. That said, you get a lot for your money with this boxset.  Final Rating (in 2 parts)  Audio Quality and music content: 5 Stars. Best version if these albums available in my opinion. (with the exception of Moving Pictures) The Deluxe Edition with DVD or Bluray is the version to own. Even better than the MFSL version which I also own.  Packaging and minilp artwork quality: 3 Stars. Feels like a cheap Chinese copy of the Japanese SHM version.  Overall Rating: 4 Stars  Conclusion:  If you want the best available version of the music and you are a true Rush fan and a completest, this boxset is a must own. If you enjoy collecting minilp's because of the artwork and the packaging, the SHM version is far superior.  Overall, I'm still very happy I made the purchase.
0399215980|2.0|I was throughly disappointed when I received a rather small package instead of a bit larger package that I expected to receive. When I ordered this book, I had thought it was going to be the large, hardback copy of the book that I had imagined it would be. Instead, I received a tiny, hardback copy that was about 3 inches tall and 4 inches in width. Needless to say I was not very pleased. I planned on giving several of the Eric Carle books to my nephew for Christmas and now I am going to have to go out and purchase the actual normal sized books!
B0053YGYO4|5.0|FROM THE FIRST SONG TO THE LAST.....YOU'LL BE SUCKED INTO THE GRABBING BEAT AND POSITIVE MOOD THIS ALBUM GENERATES.  KUDO'S TO ANOTHER SENSATIONAL - INSPIRATIONAL- MULTI-GENERATIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT!  DON'T HESTITATE TO INVEST YOUR $ IN THIS CD.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|My husband bought this CD as a surprise for me. We absolutely love it! I like that the songs (with the exception of one) are all classic Christmas songs, sung as they're meant to be sung. Michael Buble has an amazing voice and really brings these songs to life. We've already said that this is an album we can listen to for years. Buy this CD, I guarantee that you'll love it. I especially love Jingle Bells with the Puppini Sisters! Merry Christmas!
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Well crafted, interesting ideas and a perfect length.  This book has some great insights that add to the current economic discourse and should alter the national conversation on job creation and economic reform.
0066620996|5.0|This book was recommended in my post graduate work. This is an enormous source of what companies need to do to increase moral and efficiency within the workplace. Many companies were mentioned. The students of Dr. Collins did an excellent job. I highly recommend this book to all MBA and Six Sigma students and others within the business community.
B0061US58C|2.0|I've always been a Pixar fan, but this was the first big miss that I've seen from them.  I thought Toy Story 3 was bad, but this was worse.  I should have waited for this movie on DVD from netflix.  $5 was too much to pay for this movie.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I absolutely love this sound track.  It was perfect for my Halloween party since our theme was Pirates of the Caribbean!!  It added that final touch!
B005VMSATA|3.0|There were parts of this movie that were good, but it didn't really do much for me.  I liked Thor and Captain America much more than this movie.  The acting and stories were better in both of those movies with Thor being my favorite for this year.  The actors in Thor really fit their parts.  Green Lantern seemed juvenille.
B005FITIGO|5.0|Brilliantly recreated trading floor and mortgage crisis, brilliantly written and acted.  The movie I wish I'd written.    Why doesn't Bettany appear in films more often?  Extremely appealing actor, as were all of them.  Demi Moore was very restrained, in a good way.  How did JC Chandor pull this off for $3.5mm?  Brilliant.
B00006BSGZ|5.0|Maria Callas is stunning as Tosca. She is Tosca in this production. For music students so much can be leaned by her subtlety.
0800177177|5.0|It didnt follow the book exactly but still enjoyed watching it. I recommend watching it, why not. Dracula is a classic
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I have the E5 and E6 and I like them both. I prefer the build quality of the E5 because it is metal but I prefer the E6 more because of the improvement in sound by offering more ways to handle the bass. I use this little amp with my Zine HD and my Sony stereo and it makes a huge difference in the quality of the sound. I have also used it with my Bose headphones and they sound better as well. Basically I just want to add my agreement with the other reviewers that it is an improvement in sound and well worth the small price. The E6 does offer more settings so I assume most people will be happier with it above the E5 and there is an upgrade in sound as well. For the price it is very easy to suggest these amps to improve your music listening.
B00466HN86|5.0|Incredible movie.  I saw it two nights in a row.  My 19, 17 and 15 year olds and their friends thought it was great. It is not often that you find a movie that the whole family loves and would watch several times.  I highly recommend.
B005L38QK2|4.0|Update 6/13/13<br />WOW, To my surprise a customer service person responded to my email and disappointment with the quality and service of the steel series product (mouse) and company. He said that they were working on getting the warranties to be more uniform so as not to be so unfair to those of us located here in the U.S.A.<br /><br />I also asked him to update me if/when that gets taken care of so I can spread the word to my friends in the gaming communities that I've been sharing my interactions with steelseries thus far.<br /><br />They did end up replacing/repairing the mouse with the defective scroll wheel and this time I am going to give it a thorough workout for several months to see if it has anything wrong with it like the last one or if that was just a fluke breakdown of the scroll wheel. I will post any updates here for those following this review here on Amazon. But for what it's worth they did do the right thing, even though it was difficult trying to locate/connect with a USA rep. That aspect of their company could definitely still be improved upon.<br /><br />UPDATE 5/7/13<br />Well through much searching I finally found a way to send an email (through the international link, couldn't find one under USA) And to make matters worse I find out via the email that  According to their warranty, it states that it does not qualify for not assistance, exchange etc.. NAD,. Zip, Zilch! The kicker is WHY, Take a look at their biased warranty:<br />\\"1 year for customers in North America, and 2 years in Europe and other countries\\"<br />Wow, so not cool, they like EVERYONE better than us!<br />Looks like the USA is the redheaded stepchild huh??? (No offense meant to all the actual \\"redheaded step children\\"!)it is just an euphemism!<br /><br />Forget what I wrote before, since writing my original review, I had put it up as it was not my favorite mouse. Well my dad's mouse died (cheapo $20.00 mouse) so I thought he might like this one as it does look cool. Well he only had it a couple of weeks (it was almost brand new as I had only used  it about a week) anyways, the scroll wheel just conked out, it doesn't work at all. I looked online to see if there was something we could try. Nope, nothing, and they don't even have this one on their website anymore so it must have been a lemon that they dropped. At least I know now that IF you buy a steel series product you are @#$^ out of luck if it needs customer service, 'cuz there ISN'T any!!  Boooooo I give it an F- and beware buying steelseries stuff because you can't get any help if you need it, I tried for over an hour setting up a user account looking for a way to contact support etc, fuggedaboutit!only had it a couple of weeks (it was almost brand new as I had only used  it about a week) anyways, the scroll wheel just conked out, it doesn't work at all.

B005NF2UE6|3.0|Let's face it: Nickelback has had a fairly tough time with its fan base.  Mostly, they've been viewed as either inconsistent or as commercial sell-outs.  (Yes, I said `sell outs' ... that's not me calling them that ... I'm just trying to repeat what others have said so that I can make this point and then get on to talking about the tracks and the album as a whole.)  Personally, I haven't had any major qualms with their sound as I believe that, as most bands do, the boys have tried to evolve a bit over time.  When the opportunity presented itself, they decided to be a bit more radio-friendly, and that's not a bad thing when you can double your audience.  Music is still, first and foremost, a business, and double the audience means double the album sales, or so any artist might hope.<br /><br />This Means War (4.0 out of 5): Well, fans, you wanted rock, and \\"This Means War\\" is nothing but a consistent, driving guitar track for any of us to bang our head to.  Perhaps it's a nod to longtime fans who've wanted the boys to return to some of their heavier sound, though I suspect they won't be completed pleased.<br /><br />Bottoms Up (5 out of 5): Another convincing rocker about doing what bad boys do best: heavy drinking while painting the town red.  \\"This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down, we ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out.\\"  Completes a solid one-two punch to open their latest album.<br /><br />When We Stand Together (2.5 out of 5): This is the `contemporary sounding' Nickelback - precisely the sound old school fans have rejected.  It's a bit of a mix of radio rock styles that closely resembles Def Leppard.  The problem is that it's just way too generic a set of lyrics to really mean much of anything, and I suspect the track ends up being blander than anything else here.<br /><br />Midnight Queen (3.5 out of 5): There's no innuendo here.  It ain't about romance.  It ain't about cuddling afterward, boys.  It's all about doin' the nasty with the queen of the night.  Great rocker with terrific guitar work, but I've heard the lyrics a hundred times before.<br /><br />Gotta Get Me Some (5 out of 5): Nickelback has found its greatest success over the last two albums by pretty much straddling some hard rock guitar alongside some acceptable mainstream lyrics with a great undercurrent of bad-boy-fun, and \\"Gotta Get Me Some\\" is exactly what the boys have done well in the arc of their more commercial hits.  Now, in my book, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  I crank this in my car, and I can feel good about being a Nickelback fan.  \\"Get me some?\\"  That's what I'm talking about.  Plus, any song that has the word `Cuervo' in it can't be all that bad.<br /><br />Lullaby (3 out of 5): Sounds a bit like an odd Coldplay/Daughtry mash-up to me, which comes as a hint of a musical stretch for the boys.  I think the refrain is a bit too predictable (a bit too safe?) for the rest of the track.  \\"So just close your eyes, here comes a lullaby\\" weighs down the song into way too commercially safe territory when the rest of the tune is a bit more introspective.<br /><br />Kiss It Goodbye (3 out of 5):  \\"Money leads to fame, and fame is the disease ...\\"  I could be wrong, but the track feels a bit `used' ... a creative retread to some of what they've already written about.  It isn't bad; it just doesn't feel as fresh as it should.<br /><br />Trying Not to Love You (2.5 out of 5): There's little to distinguish itself from so much of what adult rock is playing these days.  That's not a bad thing, per se; it means that the track may find its way out there to the radio, but this is territory the band has already explored and with much better results.  Has a spark; it just never builds to a musical fire.<br /><br />Holding On to Heaven (4.5 out of 5): Love the refrain on this laid-back rocker, and the track boasts some solid lyrics.  \\"I'm lost without you, and there's nothing I can do, you're the one I can't go without, by holding on to you then I'll be holding on forever ...\\" For me, this is definitely one of the better tracks here, though it may not be all that significant in the band's larger body of work.<br /><br />Everything I Wanna Do (4 out of 4): Now that's a creepy sounding throughline, and that's probably exactly the mood the boys wanted to capture in this celebration of what men and women do best when the lights go down.  \\"She's got a dirty mind, it tastes so clean with every taste of me ...\\"<br /><br />Don't Ever Let It End (3.5 out of 5): Soft(er) rock songs are a hard sell because it seems like every band is using the same basic hooks, so while there may not be all that much to distinguish Nickelback with on this track, it still has a pretty solid refrain with subtle harmonies that makes for modest, middle-of-the-road rocking.<br /><br />All in all, HERE AND NOW feels more than just a bit uneven.  Could it be that Nickelback finds itself at a creative crossroads, and HERE AND NOW is an attempt to either free themselves of where they've been so that, with the next album, they can explore something a bit more fresh, innovative, and maybe even experimental?  Are they burned out?  Are they tired?  Are they indifferent?  Are they trying to found out where they want to go musically?  Or is it that, in their quest to find something different, they've lost their way?<br /><br />It's hard to say, but, with a title like HERE AND NOW, I get the distinct impression that the band wanted to say something specific about where the band is today.  I think the weaknesses here, though, strongly impede any real depth.  Very little feels authentic to me, and perhaps the bad boy image wrapped up in mainstream rockers has grown more than a bit thin, a bit tired.  Sure, as others have said, \\"maybe it's only music,\\" but Nickelback - or, at least, the Nickelback that I know - staked out some territory they were very comfortable straddling (as I've used the metaphor before).  What they did, they did uniquely well, but, to my dismay, I find an awful lot of HERE AND NOW forgettable ... maybe a light attempt to recapture some of the magic they'd already found back there and then ... and that I didn't expect.  It's an album I wanted to like much more than what I did.  Color me naïve.<br /><br />Disappointed?  Sure.  Will I get over it?

B003ZSJ212|3.0|I've held a copy of this in my hand so many times debating on whether or not to purchase this. It's mostly due to that I really don't want to own yet another set of my favorite movies and do I really want to own the prequels. However, the Star Wars nerd in me is a completionist and I want to get it over with owning all six movies. And if I'm going to own Star Wars, it better be in the \\"ultimate set\\" format. I'm also a documentary nut and love watching how movies (particularly how special effects for the originals) are made. The bonus features discs alone make me want to buy this, but right now this is too expensive. I do love the quality of Blu-Ray discs especially with my favorite movies of all time in the best digital state yet. However, after reading about the changes, yet again, to the original trilogy I'm up to the point that I need to be drunk if I want to buy this or not. Yes, the new changes made absolutely no sense in 1998, 2004, and now, but overall this is a good Star Wars product.<br /><br />I rated this product 3/5 stars in a way how each star represents to me:<br />  1 for being Star Wars films<br />  1 for all discs being Bu-ray<br />  1 for the multiple hours of bonus material<br />the 2 missing stars are obvious:<br />  1 for the alterations and not having the original Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi movies.<br />  1 for the (insert explicit word) poorly constructed prequel movies.<br /><br />Overall, I really do want this collection, but for nostalgic reason, I can't see myself spending this much money for my favorite movies again and all of the bonus material.
1451648537|4.0|I pre-ordered this book and received it quickly, perhaps too quickly.  The order was processed one day before the actual release date.  Had I realized how thick and bulky this book would be, I would have ordered the Kindle version to read on my iPad or iPhone on the go.  As it stands, it sits on my shelf having been read a couple hundred or so pages in.  I'll pick it back up when I have a good chunk of free time.  As for the content so far, I've found it a bit monotonous in terms of the lens by which Steve Jobs was portrayed.  But I suppose no biography can fully capture the essence of any single person -- they all have biases and lenses through which the figure is viewed.    In any case, there is no argument that this is a must-have book for anyone curious about not only the person Steve Jobs, but also the tumultuous story behind Apple and its winding road to where it stands today.
0345522478|4.0|The overall flavor of Hounded is suspiciously reminiscent of the Dresden Files - seductive, deadly fairies, brutish magical creatures, an egomaniacal villain; but the writing lacks the richness of detail, surprises, suspense, and angst. So why four stars then?  First off, Atticus is a fun smart a** of a druid.  And his dog Oberon totally grabbed me.  One of the best boy-and-his-dog relationships I've ever found.  I'm sure I'll read the remaining books of the trilogy if only for more of Oberon.  Oh yeah - this review's title.  This book came up in a \\"gay sci-fi\\" search and for the life of me I can't figure out why.  There's nothing even hinting at gay in the book. But that's a minor side note to a what was a fun fantasy ride.

1933952806|5.0|I recently purchased and downloaded to my iPad the Kindle version of this book that seamlessly transferred to my Kindle and iTouch with ease, amazing what technology can do these days.  I also own several 'inferior' D7000 reference books and media editions that do not stack up to this comprehensive collection of detailed information and concise examples.  With the physical book weighing in at roughly 496 pages it's nice to know I don't have to lug around a heavy brick in my camera bag for reference, though I'll most likely purchase it sometime soon to leave at home.  What I like about this book is the overall organization, presentation of examples and illustrations, and most of all the authors personal recommendations and opinions as to 'why' he prefers a given setting over others with regard to his \\"slow and deliberate tripod-based style of nature shooting...\\" (keep this in mind when you find that you don't quite agree... embrace the differences).  I'm thoroughly enjoying this book and am quite confident that any future camera purchases will be matched with only ONE reference manual...  Thank you Darrel Young.  Yes, I would highly recommend this book to anyone.

0393317552|3.0|I really enjoyed reading this book but at the same time I felt that the author was biaised in its approach and conclusions in determining the causes of the fates of human societies and it pushed me to write this review.  Like he says himself, such a task could not be resumed in one book.  So I was surprised about his determination in presenting his conclusions so strongly instead of allowing the reader to make his own mind from the facts and ideas presented in his book.  His approach is really broad and it's difficult to distinguish in his writing the difference between his interpretation and the real reasons that would explain certain events in humain history.  Our history has been shaped by many factors, some of them that we know of, some that we will know one day or others that we will never know.  Someone could write a book called: ''Natural disasters, religion and great leaders'', incorporate selected facts and lead the reader to believe that these factors more importantly shaped the world we are living now.  It would be wrong again to do so.  The book sounds like it answers it all. Still, most of the ideas of this book are really interesting.  What I liked:  - The facts presented.  So much information in a single book and the way it is presented is worth the reading.  - The ideas presented by the author on how certain environnemental factors probably shaped the course of history.  - The book covers different part of the world and not just the Occident.  What I did not like:  - I felt the author knew he would be exposed to criticisms and he spent a lot of time establishing his credentials (including his parents occupations).  He spent time also answering in advance potential criticisms.  - I did not feel his use of Maths were always adequate in his writing. Ex.: He writes in page 61: ''Population size is the product of population density (people per square mile) and area (square miles)''.  People know what a population size is. You measure a population size andthen you calculate a population density, not the other way around.  On page 364 he writes: ''The calculation given in Chapter 1 tell us that even if a mere 100 pionneering Native Americans had crossed the Canadian border into the lower United States and increased at a rate of only 1 percent per year, they would have saturated the Americas with hunter-gatherers within 1,000 years'' Such argument (linear increase of a population until saturation of a geographical area) helps the author to shortcut to conclusions. It seems easy to support historian theories this way but for me, those hypothesis spanning hundred and thousand of years in only a few sentences streches thin the validity of a conclusion based on them.  - The author repeats himself a lot.  - The author writes a lot about the fact that history is not considered as a science.  To me, this book reinforce this fact.  I consider someone must use caution in using scientific facts to explain history.  Overall:  I sometimes felt this book was written to support a title and I had to keep skepticism all the way reading it. Beside, I learned a lot. The author deserved a Pulitzer Prize (General Nonfiction, not History) for this book.  I think it is still a must for anyone interested in human history.
B001R0O9K4|3.0|...It's a historical drama. There's a big difference. This should be re-classified. I'm sure the material is historically accurate, but the scenes are re-enactments.
0316066524|5.0|This book is demanding and difficult, but not to be ignored because of that. Do not be intimidated. As an earnest, diligent reader, you will be rewarded in manifold ways, like no book you've ever read.  David Foster Wallace did not set to go about creating a deliberately unapproachable book. Infinite Jest is not intended to be unbearably unreadable (as you might think!). It is only that he expects much from his readers. He will not talk down to you. He will not overexplain. But he absolutely will expect you to meet him halfway. Some activities are passive: reading is not one of them.  Our culture's waning literary interest has mostly to do with authors who feel an arid superiority toward an uninformed readership, so they create these books that are abstruse, convoluted, haughty, and altogether esoteric as a gloating challenge to the supposed proletariat readers who just don't understand. If you can't keep up, then too bad for you. And we wonder why literature has hardly any place in our world today: the writers insist upon being deliberately uninviting to the uninformed.  DFW is not that kind of writer. Infinite Jest is not intended to aggravate or frustrate readers, though it may at times. It is simply sharing a story, and we aught to listen carefully about the techniques used therein to do so. Because it is a remarkable story with sharply insightful comments on addiction, precociousness, and how we consume and interact with media. It is truly an indispensable book to the American literary canon. In my own unprovable opinion, this book will still be discussed hundreds of years from now.  I am writing this review just before I embark upon my second reading of this text. You know from others, or could easily find out, why this book is remarkable, so I will not spend much time praising it. But I can tell you that I still carry around with me scenes and phrases and characters from this book even five years later. It is powerful. It will affect your relationship to theworld. It is that significant.  Recommendations on how to read this book:  1.) Buy two copies of this book and a good dictionary (OED). Keep all three at hand when reading. You may also want to keep a browser up for encyclopedic entries.  2.) Find a quiet place. Personally, it was difficult for me to read this book in a coffee shop or any public place, but I am easily distracted. It may or may not be the same for you. For me, there is too much force to Infinite Jest for any venue but a quiet study or a library.  3.) Read slowly: there is a lot going on.  4.) Stay on the intended path. Follow every footnote and endnote: the author has a path for us to follow. Let that be your guide. The footnotes/endnotes are not unimportant.  5.) Take notes. Keep a character list and other notes as you go along to help you remember. It also helps to read as much as you can in each sitting. You will become exponentially confused if you read this 800-pound gorilla in 2-page increments every five days.  6.) Finally, read it again within five to ten years after your first reading. I'm looking forward to doing so myself soon!  Enjoy.

B005HSG3TC|5.0|I was looking for a light case to protect my Fire when I put it in my purse. This fits the bill perfectly. The case fits the Kindle tightly and the cover provides good protection for the screen. The stand works as advertised, holding the Fire at a good viewing angle. This is a nice understated case that does the job as advertised whithout providing a lot of bulk. I would buy it again.
0123694965|5.0|I bought this book because I'm workingon designing a game and thought it would be helpful, but it went way beyond that.  The concepts in the book are fascinating reading, whether you intend to design a game or are just interested in what the process is like.  The book warns that it may lean specifically towards video games, but the concepts are broad enough that I've found that they apply to all kinds of gaming.  I'm working on a card game and have found the insights in the book tremendously helpful.  I would absolutely reccomend this book for anyone interested in designing a game, whether they're having trouble getting started or are almost wrapped up and just need a few finishing touches to perfect their design.
B003X5UFWW|5.0|I was always curious as to why this \\"unknown\\" movie was so highly rated.  Now I know.  Great story & action and a tie-in to Bruce Lee in real life.
B005POK858|5.0|It's nice to see a well designed game, and this one is fantastic.  I'm using a Galaxy S II, and haven't experienced any overheating as mentioned by others.  The game hasn't drawn much battery either.  The graphics are well done and the story line seems solid.  Excellent app for the Galaxy S II!
0439023521|5.0|I was given The Hunger Games a couple of years ago but had put it aside, as I didn't want to read what I thought would be another book about teen angst (yep, I'd read Twilight...). I finally picked it up yesterday -- and stayed up till 3 a.m. reading, because I just *had* to finish the book.<br /><br />The story was totally engrossing. It started with the necessary exposition about survival in the poverty-stricken District 12 juxtaposed with the luxury of life in the Capitol, then the pace ramped up in the Arena of the brutal games.<br /><br />To be honest, I did not expect such compelling writing in a young adult book (I often find YA works to be banal and formulaic). The book was suspenseful, hard-hitting, yet poignant. There were scenes of violence but they were not gratuitous nor gruesome. The Hunger Games is a gripping read, which I'd recommend for everyone 13 and up.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I won't waste much of this review telling you how great Deathly Hallows Part 2. If you're reading these reviews you're likely a fan who has already seen the movie and either own this Blu-ray or are about to order it. The movie is great, and the bonus features on the 2nd blu-ray disc are amazing, including a nearly hour long conversation with Daniel and J.K. Rowling. It's a must see. I'm a huge fan of the books (and was before seeing any of the movies), and while changes were made they fit the movie format. This was a must a own for me.<br /><br />But a comment on all the 1 star reviews. The app you use to stream the digital copy (Flixster) now allows you to download the movie locally to your device or computer. So ease up folks. I'm glad to be able to stream it anywhere AND download it locally if I want. I don't need a 2GB file taking up space if I'm not using it. At least this way it's safe and I can download it whenever I want, then delete it, and download it again later if I need to.<br /><br />So overall, this is a great Blu-ray set. Well worth the money for Harry Potter fans.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is the best show ever.  I have been addicted to it since season 1, and follow the Castle and Beckett (Caskett) relationship.  It is amazing, with fantastic writers and great actors.  I love it.  The banter between Castle and Beckett is so funny, and the sexual tension just makes the show that much more exciting.  LOVE!  :)
0786838655|5.0|Rick Riordan is one of my favorite contemporary children's authors, and The Lightning Thief (the first book in his Percy Jackson & the Olympians series) got me off to a flying start. It's loaded with action, mystery, suspense, emotion, and tons of humor. In this first book, we follow twelve-year-old Percy as he learns that he is a demigod, the son of Poseidon and his wonderful mortal mother, and then immediately gets sent on a dangerous and mysterious quest to save Western civilization. He takes Grover, a satyr, and Annabeth, a daughter of Athena, with him, and one of the delights of the book is watching Percy's growing friendship with Grover, and and the growing romance between Percy and Annabeth, who don't like each other at first. At the very beginning of the quest they are attacked by the three Furies, and the monsters keep getting scarier and more powerful as the quest continues. Yet Riordan's humor fills even these battles. For example, the grotesque Minotaur wears only bright white Fruit of the Loom underwear. I don't want to give away the ending, except to say that it leaves you on tenterhooks for the second book. I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.
B003L77FYS|5.0|This show is ALWAYS amazing, ALWAYS has fantastic acting, and is ALWAYS entertaining.  I have been watching since the pilot, and I have fallen in love with this show.  The Castle and Beckett (Caskett) relationship is so filled with sexual tension.  I love it.  Definitely buy season 3.  I absolutely love it.  Always.  <3
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote makes it entirely too easy to keep tabs on everything from appointments to fleeting thoughts. A must have for anyone with a daily schedule or big ideas.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|This show is AMAZING.  It gets better and better each season, with more character development and more sexual tension between Castle and Beckett.  The writing is wonderful, the acting is fantastic, and the show is just superb overall.  I have been watching it since the pilot, and have fallen in love with the show.  :)
