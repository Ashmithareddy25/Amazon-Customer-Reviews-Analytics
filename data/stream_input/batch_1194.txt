1250004349|3.0|Perhaps the two stories, written from the two points of view don't work together perfectly. Perhaps there are a few incredible coincidences. But I found this novel to be worth reading. I found the telling of Sarah's story enthralling, set in the horrifying true story of the round up of French Jews by the French police on the orders of the French government. The modern-day story of Julia was an interesting foil to the historical nature of the story of Sarah's key.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I'm in collage and absolutely love this film, it is one of my favorites. If you haven't seen it DO NOT read anything about the plot or story line and, trust me, you'll love it! Head's up, this movie is not appropriate for kids due to excessive blood and gore and some adult sex content (and maybe language? I don't really watch for that)
0312360258|4.0|I picked \\"Marked\\" up from my daughter's bedroom floor after she left for college.  I was heading off to camp and figured...why not?  I have been absolutely hooked on these books.  I have read one right after the other (in less than three weeks) and can't wait for \\"Destined\\" to be released.  I will admit I had a hard time at points because the writer kept explaining past events over and over, but I realize some didn't have the benefit of reading all the books in a row as I did.  I really enjoyed Zoey's character and the story line kept me hooked!  If you enjoy fantasy type stories - there is no way you won't enjoy these books.

B004OZOTSQ|4.0|[edit] Here's a re-evaluation of my original review now that I have more experience with my Transformer:<br /><br />* Computer access using the USB port works perfectly fine. I'm not sure if this was the initial batches of Transformers, but I was misinformed and never verified myself if this was the case for mine. I can access both internal and external drives via USB without issues (other than slow access).<br /><br />* The program has been updated to allow virtually unlimited amounts of files to be transferred. You now have an ability to add folders; however, it's lacking in the ability to over files around/organizes. So it's inferior to USB access on that end.<br /><br />* Security: This is not too much of an issue for me because unless you're on a shared, public network, and the person knows what IP address your phone/tablet has been assigned, it's unlikely that someone will access it. Are you going to head to Coffee Bean/McDonalds/Kava House/Starbucks and use Wifi explorer to send your own files across the aether? Probably not, but you're more likely to do it at home where the environment is more secure (that is, if you password-protect your router).<br /><br />So even if by default it's not protected, for me, it's not a terrible concern unless I'm actively looking for an unsecured connection and purposely broadcasting my phone's IP. Besides, if you're that concerned with being protected, you wouldn't be on a public, unsecured, wifi hotspot and you would more than likely more looking for a more secure option to connect.<br /><br />The only downsides I have to this program are:<br /><br />* Cannot move files already on your device to and from folders (the host computer only receives files from the browser)<br />* The app must remain open while transferring (you cannot have it run in the background, otherwise, the transfer cancels out)<br /><br />Otherwise:<br /><br />* No more limit to how many files you can transfer<br />* Added option to create folders<br />* More friendly interface<br />* Very easy to setup, have never had a problem connecting to host device<br />* No issues with large 5 GB files (although it does take long(<br />* Have been able to transfer files through my main PC while it was browsing a network drive (and transferred files flawlessly).More friendly interface<br />* Very easy to setup, have never had a problem connecting to host device<br />* No issues with large 5 GB files (although it does take long(<br />* Have been able to transfer files through my main PC while it was browsing a network drive (and transferred files flawlessly).

B005EJNAK4|2.0|Imagine a future where we can plug our brains into robots that possess the grace and beauty of the human form.  We send them out into the world so we can experience everything they do and live vicariously through them from the comfort and safety of our homes.   That's the future depicted in the movie \\"Surrogates.\\"  It seems plausible enough - like today's world only carried to its logical extreme.  There are glimmers of that future in the way we interact on social networks, where we can be what we want, do what we want and hide behind fake IDs.   When Bruce Willis observes a beautiful blonde surrogate walking the streets, he puts it this way:  \\"For all I know that may be a big fat dude with his d--- hanging out.\\"      I found the premise of the movie interesting, combining elements from The Matrix, I,Robot, and Avatar.  It had promise but the movie, unfortunately, was disappointing.  Someone is using a taser-like weapon to fry surrogates' brains which simultaneously sends a signal to the operators, liquefying their brains too.  FBI agent Bruce Willis takes it upon himself to find the bad guy even if that means going out into the world - something he never does - and doing it in person.  You see, his surrogate was destroyed by a renegade band of humans in a rather spectacular chase and helicopter crash.  The renegades are led by a prophet who wishes to end surrogacy once and for all.     Comparing his performance here to that in the Die Hard trilogy (which I really enjoy), Bruce Willis lacks intensity and seems merely to be going through the motions.  The younger Bruce Willis displayed in the surrogate was an interesting special effect, but not enough to carry the story.  I didn't care enough about his character or the back story involving his wife and kid, and I found little chemistry between him and his partner.  There are a couple of exciting chases but the movie drags on before grinding to a predictable halt.  I couldn't help but lose interest half way through the story.

B002RSDW80|5.0|This movie is based on the book by Julie Powell (Amy Adams), who wants to be a writer. She decides to write a blog about her attempt to cook her way through Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking. She will cook 524 recipes in 365 days. Flashbacks to Julia's (Meryl Streep) life in France, her love of French food, her life with Paul Child, and the decision to go to cooking school offer the most interesting scenes in the movie. Julia's enthusiasm for cooking is contagious.<br /><br />You'll long to eat great (not necessarily French) food while watching this film.

B0021L8V0M|1.0|This past Saturday I decided to take advantage of my local theaters air conditioning and perused the paper to see if there were any movies worth seeing. I chose the Angelina Jolie movie Salt. Simply put. I don't see what all the rave reviews for this movie were brought on by. Any fan of the old Mission:Impossible tv series with Peter Graves could see the twists and turns coming miles away but there is a much more annoying aspect to this movies toilet paper thin plot. The major scene that takes place several feet under the White House is a direct ripoff of the same sequence in the much better acted live action G.I. Joe movie that was out in theaters last year. So I strongly suggest you rent that movie instead and take this Jolie action adventure with a grain of salt.
0316098329|5.0|One of my favorite aspects of this engrossing read is the narrator, a charming five-year-old boy named Jack. He and his mother, affectionately called Ma, are held captive in a tiny 11×11 room by a man identified only as Old Nick. Jack is perfectly content in this intimate environment, oblivious to the imprisonment that Ma struggles to deal with. It is Jack's energetic voice that guides the reader through their daily routine that includes running on a homemade track, reading and watching TV. He introduces objects that are also his friends such as Rug, Bed and Dresser while showcasing his active imagination.<br /><br />Gradually Jack learns that there is a whole universe outside the walls of Room and with this knowledge the novel shifts. Although I do not want to give too much of the plot away, more characters are introduced and the relationship between Jack and Ma is tested. I read this book in one sitting, glued to the couch because I had to know what happened next. Truly a beautiful and harrowing book that will stay with you long after you have finished.

B0037A4ILC|5.0|The star of this movie is the Eiger Mountain. Yes, the movie is about the first attempted ascent of the Eiger (Ogre in English) and focuses mainly on the two German mountaineers but the mountain is, as I said, truly the star.<br /><br />The cinematography and the CGI is remarkably beautiful, awe-inspiring, scary and just plain jaw-droppingly unreal. On the DVD extras you get a great look at how the visual effects were done. There's no lengthy boring technical explanation by talking heads. They just show onscreen how layers and backgrounds are painted in as well as snow and wind. It's mindblowing technology and kudos to the visual effects co. Lugungtrug.<br /><br />The acting also elevates (excuse the pun) what is a basic story--men climb mountain, mountain wins, men lose. The buildup to the climb shows us the lives of the two German mountaineers, Toni Kurz (Benno Furmann) and Andreas Hinterstoisser (Florian Lukas), in their small Bavarian village, Berchtesgarden, that is home to a Nazi mountain brigade (and of course Hitler's summer home) that the two are reluctantly a part of in 1936...until they quit the army and decide to \\"attack\\" the Eiger.<br /><br />The other tangent is of newspaper reporters in Berlin who follow the story on the ground and actually on the mountain due to the photographer, Luise (Johanna Wokalek), and her relationship with the climbers as she grew up in the same village. The love story that develops works as Luise transforms herself over the course of the movie from a wide-eyed gopher at the Berlin newspaper offices to a talented photojournalist who sees clearly her future, the future of her nation and that of her mountaineering friends as all intertwined in the politics of the time. Yet the director never lets the politics overwhelm the story.<br /><br />Back to the filming. In the \\"Making Of\\" extra you see some of the actual behind-the-scenes footage of what was actually shot on the mountain. These actors and camera crew earned their stripes pulling some of this off.<br /><br />The \\"Making Of\\" extra also helps us learn a bit about all these fine German actors including even Luise's boss in the pic and the two actors who play the rival Austrian climbers.<br /><br />Also, although \\"Deleted Scene\\" extras on most DVD are usually filler, it is worth watching them on these as they do flesh out some scenes. I guess it was more a time thing but all these scenes do work well.The \\"Making Of\\" extra also helps us learn a bit about all these fine German actors including even Luise's boss in the pic and the two actors who play the rival Austrian climbers.

B003EYVXXW|1.0|There is not much to say about this movie. Rachel Weisz lent her talent to a movie that her acting could not hope to save. The plot, predictable dialogue, and message are dumb ed down to the point of insult to the viewer. The \\"historical\\" setting is sloppily anachronistic. Instead of being the edgy, controversial film that exposes Christianity's less-than-holy rise to power in the complex society it developed in, Agora is a slide show of charicatured Christians and pagans. Setting aside the movies goals and style- it is painfully bad and nauseatingly boring. Spare yourself.
B0042816YK|5.0|Julia Roberts stars in the movie based on Elizabeth Gilbert's bestselling memoir. I haven't read the book, so I can't say how true the film is to the book. I can tell you that the scenes of Italy, India, and Bali make the film fun to watch.<br /><br />After a divorce and another failed relationship, Gilbert walks away from her life to explore the sensual pleasures of Italian food. Her next stop is an ashram in India where she develops her spirituality. She ends her travels in Bali to reconnect with a healer she had met in New York.<br /><br />Gilbert's real life journey comes with a Hollywood ending. Lots of good messages along with a happy ending.
0345472322|4.0|The primary idea contained in this book is solid, the advocacy for a growth mindset over a fixed mindset.  Dweck's writing is engaging, and it is an easy read.  I was not a big fan of her sports metaphors and comparisons, as a few were inaccurate and taken out of context.  She seems to have something personal against John McEnroe, as she picks on him quite a bit.  She also refers to Tiger Woods as an athlete that does not get upset when he struggles and doesn't win, but rather learns from his mistakes.  Of course this book was written before Tiger's most recent struggles on and off the course, and his \\"shutting down\\" in front of the media.  It was all a bit unorganized for my tastes.  I also thought in the business section she relied too much on Jim Collins and the themes in Good to Great.  On the plus side, I am a big supporter of the approach she advocates, particularly since it is supported by a lot of research, when it comes to education and how children learn.  To me this is where Dweck shines.  Overall, I liked the book.

1451629184|5.0|This book was hard to read...until about page 70.  What I mean is that she went into great detail about some things that happened to her....and as a mother of 2 girls...it literally gave me nightmares.  However, it was well written.  I am so proud of Jaycee for being able to come out and tell her story.  I pray that she can somehow heal from her ordeal and lead a very productive life.<br /><br />Thanks Jaycee....I pray for you daily!
1451629184|3.0|If you are interested in her story then the book is worth the read. It is obvious that it was written by the victim without much assistance. There is a lot of repetitiveness, (probably needed for the catharsis that the book provided her). I was left hanging for more information about the treatment of her daughters, but understand the lack of information was to protect them. Possibly when they are adults we will get more information about how that monster really treated all of them. I doubt that the author really remembers the brutality of it all and I believe, based on the book, as her mind becomes more cleansed she will remember much more and realize that what may have seemed normal to her is not normal in a healthy home.

It's good to know the feelings of people that are kidnapped and what they must go through.  She lived to tell her story and the help she needed even after.  It also is a good book to let my granddaughter read who is 11 years old and things like this really do happen.  Not that I want to scare her, but so she realizes there are some sick, bad people out there in real life.  I had so much sympathy for her and just wanted to hug her.  I'm glad I could read the book and I will pass it on to others.  Thank you!
1599218011|5.0|Already being vegetarian (and mostly vegan), I was already on track with what she prescribes as the best foods to eat.  But I did learn some things here as far as body processes and the way foods (real or processed) react in the body.  Things that I felt I didn't have enough information on before was now made clear and I am and will be implementing some changes.  I was enlightened on the many other sources of toxins to the body, and am reinvigorated on using natural, non-toxic beauty products.  There are other suggestions and techniques that I will try to incorporate into my life as well.    Her style of writing is very loose, which is fine, but many times slang, cursing, and made-up words were used, which sometimes was off-putting and unredeeming. I appreciated the textbook-like format, with varying colors, pictures, fonts, and graphics.  It made it more enjoyable and easier to follow than a standard plain, paragraph format.    I consider this my latest health \\"bible\\" and will refer to it often (after I get it back after loaning it out).
B002ZG993Q|2.0|This was a ten minute story streched out to 1:40.<br /><br />While George Clooney is always charismatic, this was such a \\"big nothing\\" movie. The story was passible but the concept of a hitman questioning his profession, looking to get out and  being betrayed is an often-told tale. This plays like a European art house movie but the story and characters do not lend itself to such a mundane presentation. Much of this movie focuses on Clooney walking down cobblestone streets, up and down stairs, driving along country roads and moping around in a hotel...hardly captivating and cinematic. It seems as though there was fifteen minutes devoted to the assembly of a rifle and silencer!!!<br /><br />I hated the direction and lack of narration. The movie is hardly complicated yet the manner in which the story was told didn't effectively make me care about any of the characters.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Clooney because he sometimes takes bold roles however this movie couldn't have turned out the way he would have wanted. Clooney is such a good actor that I have been more harsh on this film than normal...since the expectations would be higher<br /><br />I have read some of the positive reviews of this movie and strongly disagree with them. Attributing artistic achievement to this film is akin to pushing a square peg through a round hole.

Around 2500 RPM should suffice. I'm not sure if it's a center cutter or not. Thanks for the laugh! I would like to see the Smurf IN Car though. Don't have that one...YET!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I will only say that I don't think that his geographic splitting of this book works. Neither does introducing Quentyn of Dorne. Not my favorite, but I am dedicated to seeing this through to the end.<br /><br />My least favorite part was the lack of political intrigue. Dany used to be on of my favorite characters, but she has begun to be portrayed as weak, in my opinion.<br /><br />I always love the Arya chapters. Same goes for Jamie's and Cersie's. But I do think that the Jamie chapters, except for the last page of his were not needed. I am glad he wont introduce any new point of view characters. I began to lose track.<br /><br />So now we must all wait 4-7 years for the next one.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck as an actor since he has no charisma and tends to be wooden. He single handedly made \\"Daredevil\\" a terrible movie. That being said, after seeing \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" and \\"The Town\\", I'm a big fan of Ben Affleck as a movie maker.<br /><br />\\"The Town\\" takes a simple premise and makes a movie out of it. A masked bank robber who takes a teller hostage, in order to facilitate an escape, subsequently falls in love with her, which creates some complications. How does he keep the relationship going? Does he tell her the truth? How will the other bank robbers feel about this? How does the FBI feel about their victim romancing their target? All of this is entertaining yet hardly break though cinema.<br /><br />What elevates this film is Affleck's obvious love and ability to cinematically capture Boston. He has a great feel for the working class, Irish element that is the focus of this movie. He also knows how to balance melodrama with some nice action scenes. The movie is somehow glossy and gritty at the same time.<br /><br />I love his earlier work \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" which is less flashy and has more substance than \\"The Town\\". However, the two filmed-in-Boston movies clearly shows that Affleck is the go to guy when it comes to a Boston-themed flick.<br /><br />His pacing, narration, and understanding of the demographics makes this a highly entertaining movie and, for me, an eager fan of future works.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Season one was great, and season two did not disappoint, I loved this season just as much as the first. I hope it keeps going strong
1439102813|3.0|The story is quite interesting at first. I enjoyed reading it but literary speaking, it was not the strongest. I found the repetitive phrases rather confusing which failed to show Alzheimer's effects. Also, some parts were rather vague and missed the intended purpose. I felt that when trying to show Alice's Alzheimer's, there were details that she would remember but others that she would not. In other words, she would recall moments that occurred in a while back that I highly doubt a person with the advanced stage would even recall. The entire novel as a whole at the potential to be amazing but it failed by vagueness, superficiality, and insensitivity. I personally loved Alice, but I felt the ending was rather inconclusive. I palpably felt Alice's emotions but there was substance missing.

B0034G4ORM|4.0|Is it just me when a high brow critic bashes a film I'm usually not all the time going to like it. I'am of course talking about Battle Los Angeles which right now if you asked me what's my favorite movie of 2011 this would be it. Directed by Jonathan Liebsman who unfortunately directed The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning. It stars Aaron Eckhart as Sergeant Michael Nantz & Michelle Rodriguez as Sergeant Elelna Santos. The story is some mysterious objects believed to be metors crash into Earth's oceans near major cities. But they are really hostile invaders. US Marines from Camp Pendleton arrive in Los Angeles to fight the alien invasion & oh yeah you get some good shoot outs 1 of The Marines is Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz he was planning to retire after 20 years in The Marine Corp. After losing a platoon in Iraq They have to rescue civilians from The LAPD this is also where we meet Sergeant Elana Santos. They find 5 civilians including kids & a veterinarian. Some Of The Marines were wounded during the battle earlier a helicopter comes in to take the as it takes off it's destroyed by an alien killing everyone on board. Sergeant Nantz finds a wounded alien the veterinarian helps him find out it is  easiest way  to kill the creatures is shoot at the torso area. They use a bus to get the civilians to safety. But they are followed Nantz figures out they are tracked trough their radios & cell phones so they have to turn them off. Then the bus is under attack big action scene a Marine gets on a 50 caliber lots of well done action scenes. 1 of The Marines is injured he sets off the explosives to kill the enemy unit. Some use of pratical effects. They hide out in  a convenience store Sergeant Santos hears about about the aliens are attacking Earth's water supply I have heard people nitpicking this let's just say there was no water on Earth put 2 & 2 together. The scene where the boy's father dies Aaron Eckhart had some good monologues I have to say. They have need to take out The Alien Command Center. Sergeant Nantz uses a designator missile fly's into the command center a drone stops the 2nd missile a marine fires a rocket at the drone about to srop the 3rd  missile it hits the command center The Marines retake LA  they keep it open for a sequel which I wouldn't mind. I like this as much as Skyline but I liked BLA for different reasons. The running time is a little long but the action scenes keep it going. Some of the CGI is off & on but there was some good pratical effects. Aaron Eckhart was good he's an actor I like. Michelle Rodriguez had some good moments she was better here than she was in Machete. A capable cast good SCI FI experience I'd buy this movie. If you want a straight forward action SCI FI movie I'd say see it.

She had endured two years of captivity.She still had love in her heart.<br />  As the reader, I wasn't glad she had the cat, as much as I was awed at how she kept her spirit alive in the small solaces she could grasp. It was hard to read the details of the horror, pain and unreality she endured, but so very deep to understand the beautiful life she led in contrast to her circumstances.<br />She went deep inside and examined her thoughts and feelings, but kept a survivors tight lip and found comfort where she could, even though her situation seemed impossible.<br />The thought of her mother faded and dimmed with separation and wear, but shone bright at the end.<br />Nothing can be undone, and Jaycee not just copes, but is a shining light.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I just watched this movie recently, and I can't get enough of it. I thought the Blair Witch Project was awful, so when I saw comparisons to that movie, I was leery about it. Now I can't stop watching it. I just feel it was really well made. I'm surprised some felt the characters stunk - I felt they were great, and actually enjoyed the fact that they were not famous or well-known people. Sometimes that can distract from the movie, in my opinion. I also like the fact that Hud would interject funny comments during some of the most suspenseful scenes, like when he comments that no one ever listens to him, and when they finally do, they die.     Overall, I just felt this movie was top notch. I can't wait for Cloverfield 2. I hope it's just as good, if not better than this one.

B004A8ZWVU|5.0|\\"Oscar season\\", as it's typically referred to, is a period of time, usually beginning in late November, and ending in late January. This year, it starts early, with \\"The Help\\".    \\"The Help\\" is based on the well-known novel by Kathryn Stockett, someone who I had never heard of before discovering this film and book. For the most part, when I hear about a film that I want to see, I try to read the book prior to viewing the movie, to enhance the whole experience. Usually I get bored, or stop mid-way through one of these said books, before I end up watching the movie.    But \\"The Help\\" grabbed me. Stockett kept me on a leash, dying to know what happened next, and I ended up finishing its 530 pages in a few sittings. And, I'm glad it did, because \\"The Help\\" is not only the best movie I've seen this summer, but it very well could be the best one I see all year.    The film centers on Aibileen, Skeeter and Minny (Davis, Stone and Spencer, respectively) three very different women in Mississippi, in the year 1962. Skeeter is returning from college with a journalism degree, whose beloved childhood black maid Constantine has disappeared, and no one will tell her where she has gone. Aibileen is a maid who has raised 17 white children in her life. The word \\"maid\\" is pretty blandly used. She's a nanny to these children, if not a surrogate mother. Her outspoken friend Minny has never been able to keep quiet, or, because of this, hold onto a job very long, and she is hired on the sly by Celia (Chastain), a white-trash rich girl who has some grave secrets of her own. Skeeter decides to write a tell-all book of interviews from the maids of Jackson, Mississippi, which, as you could imagine, was a very taboo, and perhaps even illegal thing to take on in the time of Jim Crow, and segregation.    One of the reasons that this film succeeds is that not a single character is miscast, and there is not a single caricature. In the book, Stockett paints a vivid picture of each character, and the actors clearly got lost in their characters. Emma Stone is becoming a very important actress. I haven't seen her in a role that I didn't love her in. After getting her first notable role in 2009's \\"Zombieland\\", and then livening and carrying the otherwise bland teen comedy \\"Easy A\\", this is her first dramatic role, as Skeeter, one of the lead characters. While she sometimes blends into the background in this movie, she shines beautifully with the rest of the cast. She's definitely one to watch.    While Stone is great, this movie belongs to Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. Davis's Aibileen is perfect. She has a silent sadness about her, a lot of pride, and a great sense of anger, her expressive eyes displaying a silent protest, while never raising her voice the whole film. She handles emotional scenes beautifully, reducing the audience to tears in more than one scene. She's a early in the year front-runner for Best Actress this Oscar season.    Spencer also does a beautiful job as Minny. Octavia Spencer was the original inspiration for the character of Minny, who voiced the character's section in the audio-book. She was clearly made to play this role. She does a lot more for this movie, than just adding comic relief, however, she does plays the comedic side the best. The \\"terrible awful\\" that her character does in the book, is made into the funniest thing in the whole movie.    The supporting cast is dead-on too. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the town's snobby ringleader, Hilly. She's absolutely chilling, nailing the evil character. Her mother, played by Sissy Spacek is a hoot. The town's secretive lush, and Minny's boss, Celia, is played by scene-stealing newcomer Jessica Chastain, who wowed earlier this year in \\"The Tree of Life\\". She was completely like I envisioned her character in the book. Chastain would be perfect to play Marilyn Monroe. Just saying.  There's not enough typing space in this review to describe how much I loved the rest of the supporting cast. Everyone was dead-on.    I was under the assumption that this would be yet another disappointing film of a book loved by many. The reason for this was the director and writer. I had never heard of this Tate Taylor, and because of that, I wasn't sure that I trusted him. He had a large part in making this movie all that it was. One of the big reasons that \\"The Help\\" works as a movie is because it feels authentic. It was filmed in Mississippi, where it's based, it is set in the 1960's, and every feeling about the movie hits the right note.    I later discovered that Taylor was a childhood friend of the book's author. Not some Hollywood hack. I forget the many disappointing film adaptations of books I loved that were made by the Hollywood elite. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Ron Howard, \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" by Rob Marshall, \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" by Ryan Murphy. Enough said. After seeing this film, I couldn't imagine anyone better-suited to making the film.    What is special about this film is that it is not what a lot of people will probably write it off as. It's not a film designed to make audiences feel less \\"white guilt\\", and it isn't about how black folks need white ones to succeed. It's about good-hearted people wanting to make a change to a world that is unjust. It avoids the usual sentimentality and melodrama that typically plagues this kind of film. I don't know how, but it succeeds in that, like I thought it wouldn't.    While some changes are (intelligently) made from the book, it's almost a scene-for-scene adaptation of the book. Some things are different, because they need to be, and things are a little more concise, yet it's almost like watching an abridged version of the book, onscreen. It will stir up emotions in you that you didn't know you had. At the ending of this film, in a packed house, there was a thunderous applause. Almost everyone in the theater stayed seated through out the ending credits. I cannot remember a time where a movie evoked such emotion from its audience, that it wasn't until after the credits had ended that people actually started walking out. This is gripping stuff. Don't miss it.    Grade: A+
1932100660|5.0|I read the China Study almost three years ago.  The impetus for reading the book was this:  I was training for Triathalons and my weight was increasing.  This seemed counter-intuitive because my excercise level was increasing dramatically.    I posted a message on a Triathlon website that basically said, \\"I'm training harder than ever, following a solid diet (mainly from Men's magazines) and my weight is increasing almost monthly.    At the time I was almost 225, a clydesdale in the Triathlon circuit.    A message came back from the post above, \\"Two books.  Read them.  You might not like them but they are the bible of nutrition for athletes\\".  The two books were:  The China Study, and Eat to Live.      I figured I had nothing to lose and might as well follow this advice.  I found both books to have sufficient scientific credibility.      I changed my diet.  In four months I dropped 40lbs and never felt better.  My blood pressure, cholesterol, lipids and other blood vitals improved.  I posted a message thanking the Triathlete poster from above, he (I know who it was) wrote back, 'now you know what most ultra athletes know'.      I have shared this book with two friends that had some ongoing health issues.  Both have had great success with their health issues by following the The China Study/Eat to Live combo.  One called me up at Christmas the year and thanked me for saving his life.  I have spread this 'nutritarian' message to as many peoople as will listen.    No matter what you read and what you want to believe you have my testimonial and several others below.  It works.  The combined forces of the goverment, big business, academia and medical professionals will have you stick with the status quo.  Break away.  Try something new.  You will be suprised at the multiple benefits it provides to you and your life.
B004HO6HWA|4.0|I liked this movie,it is a good update of the original film. I liked the 1972 version, it is one of my favorite Charles Bronson movives. This movie has all the modern 21st century special effects and some great action scenes. I am not of big fan of Jason Statham's films, but he does a good job as his version of Arthur Bishop in this one. The movie works.
B0051OZ564|5.0|The movie may not have the gift-wrapped ending many Americans have grown accustomed to but the movie is anything but flawed or sad.  It's cgi is amazing and the story (with twists) is inspiring in a not-so-perfect world. If you're left with an overwhelming sad feeling then you've missed the point and should re-evaluate your own inner strength. Don't overanalyze since action movies are never the place for that anyway just watch the movie and have fun!

0316044938|3.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a spiritual fiction book that I have been a little late in reviewing, although I do have a great excuse - I never started my career as a reviewer until last month! It is very well written and I would recommend it for younger readers, particularly teens and young adults. The story line is taken from the perspective of a fourteen year old who remains fourteen for the entire book. She evolves as an observer, yet does not \\"get involved' in the outcome of the plot once she is removed as a physical character. My \\"issue\\" is with the circumstances of her murder...<br /><br />I read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" and then immediately went out and rented the DVD. I was curious to see how the murder of Suzie Salmon would be depicted in the movie, as it didn't make sense to me in the book. The movie just made it even more unconvincing for me.<br /><br />Suzie Salmon is a normal fourteen year old girl. She is walking home from school one afternoon through a harvested cornfield (that piece of information is paramount to my issue) when she is approached by a known neighbor. George Harvey convinces Suzie to have a look at something he has built in the cornfield, and against her better judgment, she agrees. Mr. Harvey has constructed an underground room in the middle of this cornfield, which is in viewing distance of the town's suburbs and fairly close to the school Suzie and other students attend.  Once lured into this underground room, Suzie is raped and murdered by Mr. Harvey. He \\"collapses\\" the room and disposes of Suzie's body, leaving very little evidence. The police find some lumber and a significant amount of blood in the earth. Her hat is found by the police, and a neighbourhood dog finds Suzie's elbow (she was dismembered). This is the only proof that she has been murdered as her body is never found.<br /><br />This is a spiritual fiction book, similar to \\"Ghost\\" with less violence and a less sinister plot. Unlike \\"Ghost\\" which begins with Patrick Swayze being murdered in an armed robbery (believable), Suzie Salmon is murdered in an underground room in a field of corn. It is the beginning of December and the corn has been harvested. This means that the room would have to have been started in September after the harvest, or the combine would have collapsed the whole thing. The hole would have to be dug and the earth removed and hidden a sufficient distance away to leave no evidence that it was there. Lumber would have to have been brought in for the roof (ceiling) and support walls without the benefit of heavy machinery.  ALL of this was done by ONE man in the middle of the night over a maximum of three months' time! He would have to have left no tracks and left no great disturbance of the surrounding area EVERY NIGHT (to the point of replacing the corn rows above ground which would have been visible). In the movie, it even shows him digging at night using the lights from his car shining on him as he works.<br /><br />Once he had committed the murder, he would have had to get rid of Suzie's body, take away all of the lumber and articles he had in the room which were shown in the movie, substantially fill the hole with dirt again and cover his tracks. This would have had to have been done without a vehicle within the space of one night (possibly two if he was lucky) before the area was thoroughly searched.<br /><br />I believe that a book needs to have a believable beginning, even if you are going to put your beliefs in as you progress. I'm not sure how many people would care that the beginning did not add up to what would be physically possible. Perhaps when you are able to believe in God, heaven, hell and other things spiritual, literary license can make the physical improbabilities irrelevant. It wasn't the case in my experience, so it puts the book on my list of those that I give away, rather than keep on my bookshelf to read again.<br /><br />I did finish reading the book within a week so the unbelievable portion did notcause me to stop reading, however a more believable beginning would have made the rest seem more real to me. I did love the slant on what heaven may be like, and I also believe there is an \\"in-between\\" that some of us will experience for a period of time when we die - kind of like being held after school when you really just want to go home. The book also has heartbreak, romance, drama and a very happy ending, so I hope you enjoy it.<br /><br />By the way, I do have experience trying to dig exactly what Mr. Harvey dug. It took me and my three brothers and my sister most of the summer to get a six foot wide and 8 foot long hole about two feet deep with a couple of sheets of plywood and two by fours for a roof completed. The roof sagged, the bottom was a mudhole whenever it rained, and there was no way to hide the evidence of our activity, corn or no corn.<br /><br />Laughter and love,<br /><br />Rick Fessable beginning would have made the rest seem more real to me.

0891419063|5.0|This book is not character driven, like say Band of Brothers.  Published in 1981 or so, this is the most brutal description of war I have ever come across.  This is a recollection of battles that were fought under conditions that the human mind can not even conceive.  One excerpt talks about the rain on Okinowa and how the Japenese bodies were just bulldozed under dirt and mud and one solider slid down into the pit where the bodies had been buried for a  few days and was among the bodies and he emerged covered in swollen maggots.  A scene out of a horror movie.  The book is an unbelievable description of war, no friendlies here, at least in the European theater every once in awhile you came across a friendly village in France or Italy.  The two main battles described were Pelieu and Okinowa.  If you get a chance check out the mini series the Pacific.  The mini series can't do justice to the book but does a good job.

0062112430|5.0|Love is a most potent & dangerous illness. So dangerous in fact, a cure has been created to prevent the population from having to suffer under its wrath. Lena Holoway can't wait until her 18th birthday, the day she'll finally receive the cure. She's not scared, she's simply anxious to have it over with already. A life without love is predictable & normal, safe. She's spent her whole life in the shameful shadow of her mother's love-induced suicide that Lena is ready to be protected from the deliria's grasp.    In a measured & calculated, fenced off Portland, Lena has spent the last 17 years of her life listening only to prescribed music, reading only approved books & being monitored for any possible sign of deliria infection. A few of her fellow classmates succumb to the terrible disease, but Lena is pleased that neither she nor her best friend Hana have been stricken. That is until Lena happens to meet Alex. And then, everything changes...    I know my review is a little shorter than you may be accustomed to from me, but that's because I continued to give away too much of the story as I wrote. This book was PHENOMENAL!! I absolutely could not put it down. The way the story is written is quite emotional because, despite the eradication of all forms of love, there is this undercurrent of repression. Suppressing a natural instinct is one of the most dangerous things that can be done & I honestly believe that this society is constantly on the brink of rupture. Why else would there be roving bands of guard-like protectors?    On a character level, this book was miles above the author's last attempt, Before I Fall. Many of you may recall my distaste for Oliver's characters in that novel & will say that I am very pleased that I tried this novel. A lot of the time if I don't like the first book an author has written, I won't bother to read any more. The premise of this book was too great to pass up & the characters were exactly what I was hoping they would be. I really enjoyed watching Lena struggle with not only her past & present, but with both her society & her expectations for her life. The three main characters, Lena, Hana, & Alex, are thoroughly formed & can stand on their own. While they all play off one another, I could see them working an independent people.    So basically in summation, you really need to read this book. While I may be overlooking some of the more minor editing details (that I'm sure will be cleaned up in the final editing) I really think this book has a great message & execution. Please enjoy & let me know your thoughts!

B004XQO90O|5.0|I went into Source Code really knowing nothing but what I had been hearing from word of mouth. It's about an US Military man named Colter Stevens who wakes up on a train and finds that he's in another mans body. He later wakes up in some sort of hatch to be told he's part of a secret Government missions called The Source Code which will allow his conscience to be passed into another mans body and relive the last 8 minutes of that person's life. In this case, he takes schoolteacher Sean Fentress' body, and must find out who the bomber is on a train bound to Chicago. Now, trust me, I thought that I would be bored watching the same 8 minute loop over and over again. But I have to admit, I actually kinda liked it because it really wasn't the same every single time. I'm not going to spoil anything to people who haven't seen it yet, but I really couldn't find anything wrong with this movie. It was highly entertaining and took you on a journey that even I couldn't have predicted at the end. It's not overly long, running at only 93 minutes, and it is definitely a success!
B00006AW2M|2.0|I have tried to like this album, but it is a hard thing to achieve. If it depended on the first song, as an aperitive, you would take this out of the player right out. An obvious (and miserable) copy of the Beatles, with just a couple of good songs, everyone knows which ones, so better buy them in mp3 format and save some money. Full of cheesy effects (snoring, WTH??) If you don´t think it is, watch almost every video of the Beatles while on travel, and you will surely watch Mick Jagger, mingling around them to see what pieces of their creativity would drip unto him, LOL...I heard it today, and the last time I heard it was more than a year ago...so maybe in a couple of years I will give it a try. A star for each good song in this mess.
0071373586|5.0|This book seems a bit less relevant at some points now that the term 'positioning' is so well known but even so it's still a must read to anyone in marketing, product management, sales and practically everyone else too. Some of the examples given in this book may seem outdated however if you ignore the examples technical side and just focus on what they represent you still see why this book is a classic even today, many years after it was originally published. The book is very easy to read, the chapters are short and are broken into shorter \\"sub chapters\\" that are each focused on a single message.  I recommend this book to everyone that is interested in understanding marketing products better.

B0057A6GA6|4.0|I love defense games. I rated this one as a decent one, but not one of my favorites. It is simple to learn and to play though I do feel like it is missing a few things, such as upgrade capabilities. There isn't much in the way of replay on this, and the skill jumps between levels is pretty big. It does have achievements, the graphics are okay, but the sound gets on your nerves in a hurry. It is just a three second repeat of a song over and over again. The idea of items being dropped (like gold or more life) in the gameplay is a new twist, but it wasn't something that made this game terrific.

B004Y1USV2|4.0|There is always a dated and moot debate amongst yes fans about how the band should sound and which lineup is the best. The point is that it doesn't matter. What matters is the music. Fly From Here is all about the music and it's good. All the classic Yes elements are here. Virtuosity, symphonic arrangements, ambiance, deep lyrics... etc. This is almost a classic lineup. The album is compared to Drama in sound, but I think that it has its own sound. It's more streamlined than classic Yes such as Close To The Edge, but it's more sophisticated than more commercially-oriented efforts such as 90125 or even Open Your Eyes. Fans of Yes should not be disappointed, yet I read reviews that dismiss this album only because Jon Anderson isn't on it, or because it isn't as obtuse and dense as Tales From Topographic Oceans. (Benoit David doesn't disappoint with his performance here as Anderson's stand-in. He has a warmth and passion that is sometimes missing in other recent Yes releases) The truth is that all Yes albums are good to one extent or the other as long as one listens to them in their own context.     Fly From Here is a phenomenal listen from beginning to end, the best track being FLY FROM HERE Pt. 2: SAD NIGHT AT THE AIRFIELD. That track alone should be enough for any Yes fan to want to own this album. It is classic Yes in every sense. Oh, and it's also accessible. The entire title track is good from start to finish. Here they wisely divided it into sections instead of laying it out as one long suite a la 70's style. That gives detractors of overly long songs a chance to pick and choose which tracks to listen to. I listen to the whole thing, and if it had been made a one-piece suite, it would clock in at around 23:44 minutes. If you want long tracks, then listen all the way through. The rest of the album is not as good, but still well above average Yes fare. I would include this album in my top five favorite Yes albums, depending on what mood I'm in. Hour Of Need is thelow mark on the album but is still average Yes. Another standout track is Into The Storm, with its complex time signatures and catchy motifs. If the band would've stuck to this kind of songwriting instead of trying to replicate the success of 90125 in the 80's and 90's we would've had a much more solid legacy from this great band. It's not that I don't like 90125, I do. It's definitely a Trevor Rabin dominated album, with the unmistakable contributions from the rest of the band elevating his songs to art-pop/rock. The problem is that the albums after that seemed to lack the freshness and inspiration of 90125. This album has that freshness and inspiration and is not an art-pop/rock album. It's progressive rock with restraint and taste. I've been listening for over a month and I'm still enjoying this.    The production is also restrained and tasteful. The instruments have never been more clearly imaged and the mix is balanced with minimal sound effects and just the right amount of polish. The cover is appropriately in the vein of classic yes albums from the 70's and was done by Roger Dean, the same artist.      Highly recommended for Yes fans and fans of progressive rock. It's as good a place as any to start a Yes collection.
B0034G4ORC|1.0|... but I was wrong. This flick doesn't stand one second in front of ID4 where at least the scope of the plot went beyond the two blocks of Los Angeles ocean front the viewer is locked up. The \\"attack\\" is supposed to be \\"planet wide\\" ... and there has been only one guy out of 7 millions earthlings who got the idea to knock down the \\"mother ship\\"?!? What a blast.<br /><br />Then, I am totally fed up by these sci.fi. writers who \\"design\\" slimy aliens, with tentacles, snoot-like appendices, clawed fingers ... Please sit down and start thinking a bit: \\"How did these dudes managed to invent and build such complex technology space vessels ... and put them together with their tentacles and claws ?!?  Man, how can they got that nut assembled on that bolt with clawed fingers ???  Stop taking us for imbeciles !<br /><br />On top of that ... ENOUGH of this shaky filming four feet away from the subject, focused through a stove pipe. I have a widescreen home theater system, my eyes want to see landscapes, with the camera set on a tripod.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I read this book a few years ago and absolutely loved it.  That's why I made sure to see this film in its first opening days. I've seen some other film adaptations of books lately and have been disappointed.  And so I must say that I was completely delighted with the film adaptation of \\"The Help\\".  Not only did it stay true to the book, it was so well cast that every character rang true.  I laughed.  I cried.  And I felt real emotion throughout.  The filmmakers did an outstanding job and I want to shout \\"Bravo\\".<br /><br />The story is set in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960's.  Emma Stone is cast as a young white college graduate who yearns to be taken seriously as a writer.  Her first job is writing a column on cleaning house in the local paper and so she starts interviewing the African American women who work as maids in the homes of her friends.  Immediately, her eyes are opened to the realities of their lives and decides to turn her knowledge into an eventual book.<br /><br />Viola Davis is excellent in the role of Aibileen who gives the child she cares for an abundance of love and attention.  Octavia Spencer is cast as Minnie, another maid with a strong personality who is full of grit and gumption.  And Bryce Dally Howard is cast as Hilly, an obnoxious young white social-climbing woman who we all love to hate.<br /><br />The plot moves swiftly and even though the film is 2-1/2 hours long, I was so caught up in it that I didn't want it to end.  Here was a snapshot in a time of racial prejudice and the exploitation of household help in a era that has hopefully passed into history.  And yes, it also has its bittersweet comedic moments which made the film even more endearing.  I loved this film.  Don't miss it.
0385335997|5.0|12 hundred pages indeed!  In the third book there's a kind of apology, for the size of her books from our writer to us.  Of course is not necessary because you are so into it, that you don't want it to end, each and every page is needed and appreciated.  A friend of mine got me reading Voyager (dark green and very austere in the front) and ask me if I was seeking salvation through the Bible and I answered him \\"I'm seeking all right\\" But the enjoyment of this incredible journey of this couple and the kind of deep seated feelings you long for, this kind of passion.  I've read so far and being disappointed in the least and I'm afraid I can't stop here.

B0051MKNV8|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and thought it was good so I bought it for my Dad's Birthday. I liked it the first time and I liked it the second time, and I would probably watch it again. Edward is going no where fast with his writing career until he runs into his ex-wife's brother who gives him a pill that gives him full access to his brain. The short term effects are great for Edward he's motivated, smart, and gets rich quick...however, like with any drug there are consequences. The action in this movie keeps you entertained and the plot twists are great.    I did watch the alternate ending and I am definitely glad that's what it was, \\"the alternate\\" because the real moving ending was much better.

B004LWZW4W|4.0|Disaster movies are a dime a dozen now a days. We have seen an influx of Alien takeovers recently and it is getting a bit stale I must admit.  Don't get me wrong, I love films about ET's taking over, but Hollywood has beaten that horse to death.  \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" is a welcome change to this trend pitting us measly humans against our closest ancestors, Great Apes.  Directed by Rupert Wyatt (\\"The Escapist\\") and supported by the unbelievable WETA Digital (\\"King Kong\\", \\"Lord of the Rings\\", \\"Avatar\\") for special effects. \\"Apes\\" is a wonder of motion capture, an intelligent heart felt script with great direction.  Unfortunately, the human actors left a lot to be desired.  But this film isn't about the humans, it's all about the Simians.<br /><br />As plots go, this is pretty basic.  James Franco plays Will Rodman, a brilliant scientist with a breakthrough drug that just may cure Alzheimer's.  Rodman and his team are using chimpanzee's to test this new drug and in the process find out that it increases intelligence as well as repair cells in the brain.  One of the test subjects gets loose in an intense sequence and ultimately put down.  It turns out that she had just given birth to a beautiful baby chimp who inherited this new \\"altered\\" gene.  Rodman decides the only moral thing to do is to take the baby home while a co-worker tries to find a sanctuary but once Rodman finds out that this little ball of fur has the intelligence of a human child twice it's age he decides to keep and raise the chimp as a child.  It's only a matter of time that our chimp Caesar figures out he is not like the other children in the neighborhood.  Rodman is forced to give up Caesar to an \\"Ape Sanctuary\\" and there begins some of the most exhilarating revolutionary action I've ever seen.<br /><br />Technically, this film is massive.  The work WETA Digital did with motion capture (mo-cap) is truly a wonder to behold.  Visual Effects Supervisor with WETA Digital Joe Letteri stated that they built on the technology used in \\"Avatar\\" to produce the most realistic and accurate portrayal of the actors suited to play the Simians.  Andy Serkis (Gollum from \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and Kong from \\"King Kong\\") plays chimp Caesar.  Serkis manages to fool all of us into believing he is a real animal with super intelligence.  His facial emotions and mannerisms should most certainly nominate him for an Oscar.  There is a real connection that the audience feels with Caesar and it is all thanks to Serkis' work.  Without such an experienced mo-cap actor, this film would not have been such a success.<br /><br />Not only is the technology used to create the revolution amazing, the action is top notch as well.  Many times I found myself with my jaw on the floor from the intense sequences put to screen.  Everything from a simple terrifying look from an angry ape to the full out battle on the Golden Gate Bridge was pulled off without a hitch.  Many points to the pacing of the films action as it could have been the crutch that killed this beast of a film.  One of the most amazing scenes in my opinion is when a group of apes are fleeing over top a suburban neighborhood through the trees.  While this is going on we see some people on the street while leaves upon leaves are falling to the ground.  This level of detail is apparent in every shot, brilliant work by the production team.<br /><br />My only problems with this film is the acting from Franco and Freida Pinto, who plays the love interest.  They both seemed to \\"phone it in\\" as it were.  They were not overly impressive and just seemed stale.  Maybe the director wanted them to tone it down so that Serkis would have more of an impact acting as a voiceless chimp.  Either way, as I said in the beginning, this film wasn't about the humans.  It's about compassion, freedom and understanding and on those levels the film is a grand success.the technology used in \\"Avatar\\" to produce the most realistic and accurate portrayal of the actors suited to play the Simians.

I have thought it can't simply be only about calories.  I have always believed there must be something else.    I am recommending this book to everyone I know.  I have cut my carbs (no flour products and no sugar at all), and it has changed my life.  I feel fantastic.

The sleep section is pretty good---but most of the advice requires money.<br /><br />I appreciate the book as it makes you take responsibility for your health---it challenges you to make challenges and kind of sets up each health goal you set as a competition.<br /><br />If you're looking to improve your sleep, I'd also suggest the section on sleep in \\"7 Day Energy Surge\\". Taking the two chapters on sleep from this and that have made me a sleep master.

0553801473|3.0|Let me open by saying that I am a fan of this series, watched and enjoyed the HBO show, and very much looked forward to this book.  That being said, my review:  We've waited a long time to find out what GRRM had in store for the \\"main\\" characters of his series; however, we find out that the answer is \\"nothing much.\\"  Jon Snow spends the entire novel fretting over bureaucratic details of running the Wall (how much food is in the stores, how to rebuild and fill empty keeps, counting wildlings  etc.) without much happening to move his story forward.  In parallel, Danaerys spends the entire novel fretting over bureaucratic details of running Mereen (unidentified rebels, a trade blockade, who she needs to marry, a crumbling economy) without much happening to move her story forward.  It's been a long stretch since Book 3 and we have these characters still stuck in one place two books and eight (real world) years later.  Tyrion, a once-great character, has been reduced to tilting while riding pigs and dogs?  Tyrion's chapters  move no global plotline forward.  Despite the title, there's nothing involving A Dance With Dragons.  I gave the book 3/5 stars mainly because the writing itself continues to be good.  Martin writes very well (notwithstanding his fetish for painstakingly describing food and drink); I enjoyed the immersive experience of reading the books in this series.  My primary criticism is, after the great Books 1-3, the passage of so much time since any major plot movement (eight years since Book 3), and two long books, we've had little progress on the overall story of finding a winner in the \\"Game of Thrones\\" in Westeros or dealing with the still-amorphous \\"White Walker\\" threat.  On a minor note, a battle or two (particularly one outside of Mereen and involving dragons) would've been nice to balance against the lengthy chapters involving Jon and Danaerys mired in red tape.<br /><br />Sadly, I've seen this before - with Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" books: a once-great series stalling out as the author is either at a loss of how to move the story forward or simply milking the early success of the franchise for every dollar he can.  GRRM clearly has the ability to write well and finish this series strong, let's just hope he does so before we need another substitute author to get it done (I think Brandon Sanderson is now available...).
B0050PYNO4|3.0|Paul was pretty funny at times and exactly what I expected it to be....with one exception.<br /><br />First of all, you know when you mix [[ASIN:B000WZEZG8 Superbad]] Director Greg Mottola with Seth Rogen there will be sticky green silliness. Throw in Simon Pegg and Nick Frost and that's silliness icing on the cake. Pegg and Frost play a couple of sci-fi convention geeks that 'encounter' a real alien--that of course being Rogen/Paul--as they travel home from ComicCon. Paul is funny, obnoxious, lovable, gross and he likes his weed. I know, shocking, right? Rogen playing a weed smoking alien....That was as predictable as the rest of the movie.<br /><br />There are some laughs from a plethora of good comedians throughout the movie, and some of the cameos are well placed and well played. Paul is a fun movie. But I found it odd that Paul Writers Frost and Pegg had such an Atheist message to deliver with the film. I'm fine with a movie that has a message, and I'm neither for nor against a movie with an Atheist message; I was just a little surprised that the movie came on so strong with a \\"God does not exist\\" message. This takes a big risk in the entertainment business by potentially offending half or more of your fan base.<br /><br />So see Paul if you're looking for a few laughs, but if you're a fan of Paul the Apostle you might not like Paul the Alien's opinion on who or what created the universe.

B004XQO90E|4.0|If [[ASIN:080017948X Groundhog Day]] were written by Tom Clancy, David Baldacci or one of those guys that can craftily weave a tale of terrorism, you may have just ended up with Source Code. Instead of comedy with Bill Murray you get an action film with Jake Gyllenhaal that exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal connects to the Source Code through a device that allows him to experience the last eight minutes of a person's life. The movie explains that this is not necessarily time travel, but rather placing the user in an alternate time line, universe or something like that. Um...okay. Even though I've tried and failed to get my mind around the difference and what exactly it all means, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie from start to finish. The movie keeps the action and suspense coming as Gyllenhaal time after time is thrown back in time...er, I mean, into an alternate whatever...in order to discover the location of a bomb aboard a train and more importantly identify who put it there and detonated it.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal practically is a one man show albeit with some rather small supporting moments from the other main characters. Source Code might just be Gyllenhaal's best performance to date (that I've seen). I guess some kudos should also go to Michelle Monaghan for playing her part so uniquely but also precisely in the succession of \\"on the train again \\"Groundhog Dayesque\\" sequences. And keep an eye out for Director Duncan Jones next project, because if it's a s good as Source Code or his last project called [[ASIN:B002T9H2ME Moon]] it'll will be something worth waiting for and watching.<br /><br />Check Source Code out if you're looking for a good action flick.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|GRRM remains an enviable writer - I do wish I had his talent.  However, in this book he has proven to be a mediocre story teller.  I have come to his writings only within the last few months due to the HBO series which I have not seen.  I, therefore, cannot truly say I have insight into his psyche which requires a certain intimacy that I have not developed yet as a reader of so few of his writings.  However, I can say something is amiss.<br /><br />I can say that the story is not progressing, though I have enjoyed his writing to some extent.  If I wanted to read a grocery list, I have several on my crackberry and do not need to purchase GRRM's.  If I wanted pages/hours of self-doubt, ramblings, perseverations and underachievement, I have my own to stew in.  I am not snarky for it's own sake, but highly frustrated.  I am an avid reader and enjoy a good story well told.  (I did not check these books out of my local library, of which I am a huge fanatic.  I purchased all 5 in the series on Kindle.)  I will even take a good story poorly told.  However, I will not continue to purchase a non-story no matter how well it's told.<br /><br />I realize this review does not go into detail about the book - others have done an excellent job of that.  The only way I know to voice my dissatisfaction with the book is with 2 stars for lack of plot progression.  I hope book 6 gets good reviews for plot - I shall need that before I entertain another purchase of this series.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I really liked this version of Jane Eyre but I still think the 2006/2007 Masterpiece Theatre one with Toby Stephens was the best I've seen. The acting in this adaptation was alright and the casting good,but I was alittle disappointed in the ending. I think it could've been longer. Why a movie like Inception (So BORING) was so long and a movie like this so short is beyond me. And they left out too many things that you see in other adaptations. I know they could not fit everything in 2 hours. I would've been more satisfied if atleast the ending was 10 or 15 minutes longer.

B004XWLN20|2.0|I have always loved the Superman stories so I watched this show, I didn't enjoy this show until the last 2-3 seasons. I stuck with it to see what would happen. I would have liked Tom Welling as Clark Kent if he had been better able to portray the good hearted person that the character was supposed to be. Maybe that was the intent of the creators of the show. Tom Welling's eyes were so cold in this show, vacant and very vain. I didn't believe that this Clark Kent was a very good person his eyes were completely vacant. To me, Clark Kent was supposed to be modest and even though he is Superman, he is not supposed to think he is a Super Man. I prefer Dean Cain as Superman, he actually fit the part. I am really not sure if the fault lays with the creators maybe they were trying to make him more human, or the actor. Otherwise I would have liked this show once it got past the first few seasons and once Lois came around. This show had enormous potential.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I stumbled across this little gem here under my Amazon recommendations.  I'd never even heard of this series of books or the fact it was an HBO show. I read the synopsis and all the reviews here about the show and I was very intrigued.  I like Sean Bean as an actor, and enjoyed Peter Dinklage from Nip/Tuck, and as everyone raved about his performance in this, I thought I'd check out at least one episode.    WOW oh WOW.... This series just blew me away!  The storyline was amazing!  All the machinations, assignations, intrigue, deliberations, or stunning confessions that go on are incredible.  The sets and locations are gorgeous.  The theme music is very stirring and the opening credits are creatively done.  I can see why each episode runs a cool $6 mil.... I'm afraid I'll run out of superlatives in describing this show.  There were many times in watching the series where I was shocked and stunned, like \\"wow.... Oh my gosh, did that really just happen?\\".... You think you may know what's going to happen next, and the show surprises you.  It plays out like an elaborate and intricate game of chess.  I love shows that do that.   You may not recogize many of the names, but you'll recognize a lot of the faces.  Mark Addy (Roland from A Knight's Tale, Bill Miller in Still Standing) is wonderful as Robert, king of the seven kingdoms.  Rightfully on the throne?  Some aren't so sure about that.  Eddard (Ned) Stark (excellently played by Sean Bean, Boromir from Lord of the Rings) is Lord of Winterfell and Robert's friend. Ned is asked to come to Kings Landing and accept the job of Hand of the King, due to the recent demise of the previous title holder.  Some whisper assassination.  If that is indeed the case, Ned wants to know why he was killed.  Lena Headey (Queen Gorgo in 300) is superb as Robert's wife Cersei Lannister.  Talk about a 180 degree character portrayal from her role in 300.  She was amazing, I loved to hate her. And no one could have played the role of Cersei's brother Tyrion, \\"the Imp\\" better than Peter Dinklage. He almost steals the show with his performance.  The actors playing two of Ned's younger children are phenomenal, especially Maise Williams as Lord Stark's spunky and scrappy daughter Arya.  This little gal will be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come.  She will definately be one to watch.  Isaac Hempstead Wright plays Arya's brother Bran to perfection.  The actors playing Ned's older children deliver solid performances as well.  Even Natalia Tena (Nyphadora Tonks in Harry Potter) delivers an outstanding performance in a minor role as Osha, a criminal turned new house slave at Winterfell.   Then of course, there is the ominous and massive Wall.  Manned for thousands of years, most have forgotton why they even continue to stand the watch, and where deserting your post still means death.  Yet rumors and frightened witnesses swear that monsters and white walkers are beginning to stir, and icy horrors wait beyond the wall. Dragon lore and direwolves are also spoken of.  Toss into the mix House Taragaryen across the narrow sea. In exile, Viserys Targaryen desires to take what he feels is his rightful place on the throne in Kings Landing, and sells his sister Daenerys in marriage to the Khal of the fierce and nomadic Dothraki tribe, (think Klingons of the wastelands) so that Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa from Stargate Atlantis) will provide the muscle Viserys needs to get the job done.    There are several family dynamics occuring at the same time and it's very involving, so I would refer to IMDB to better understand who was who and where they fit in to the storyline, (thank you IMDB). There is soooooo much more happening than what I've mentioned here, but this review is already getting to be the length of a book itself, so just check it out for yourself.  If you are offended by nudity or violence, this may not be the show for you.  Game of Thrones hits the ground running right from the opening credits where you see a white walker, and let me tell you, they're creepy.  This show grabs you and doesn't let go. It's one hell of a ride. I can't wait for the second season.  HBO, you definately have a gem of a winner in this series.  During the hiatus, I'll be reading the books.   ~ jade ~
1594744769|5.0|When I first heard about Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, I'm admit that I wasn't very interested in it. It just sounded...peculiar. But after seeing all the positive publicity about it, I thought it was time to give it a try. Plus, it was Quirk Books, so it's hard to go wrong there.    Growing up, Jacob always enjoyed his grandfather's stories, as peculiar as they are. As he grew up though, the strange photographs his father kept and the wild stories that went along with them seemed more and more out of the ordinary. When Jacob's grandfather dies, he goes on a strange journey to find the mysterious abandoned orphanage where his grandfather's stories took place. What he finds is a rag-tag collection of peculiar children stuck in the 1940s -and it's up to him to help protect this strange place, no matter as peculiar as it seems.    A unique blend of fiction and photography, Peculiar Children is a unique and exciting YA novel that's thrilling from beginning to end. With a refreshing and original story, unforgettable characters and great storytelling, it's hard to go wrong here. In fact, I finished Peculiar Children in just one sitting. In fact, I thought I wouldn't like the inclusion of the photography, but it only helps to paint the unique, on-edge tone of the novel.    If you haven't read this book, or aren't even considering it: read it. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is unlike anything else you've ever read. All I can say is: more please.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I got this game when it was 2.99 well worth the money even at 7.99.  once you beat the main story you can continue using your characters in two different ways.  either start over all leveled up or go on to find hidden dungeons. I chose the hidden dungeons, only got a few of those but it seems you are collecting stones to make a real powerful piece for character. really good game, even if the story is a bit contrived.
B0032JTV6U|3.0|The series is awesome and this 7-disc set provides extras such as a short choreographers' clip showing some of the dance steps and lots of video clips of just the musical performances - which I only realized after fast-forwarding to Jane Lynch's performance of Madonna's \\"Vogue\\" over and over again.  I love this series.    The individual discs are only labeled numerically, though -- you can only see the episode names when you get to the menu.    As far as the copy I received, it was rated 'like new' but in the 2nd disc there were some minor problems with the scene dragging and displaying the image pixels really big.  It was only right at the beginning and wasn't too annoying -- and I can put up with a certain amount since I know it's a used product.    However, by the time I got to the 6th and 7th disc, I could not get the option for choosing episodes to work so I had to opt for 'show all.'  Then it started hanging in certain parts of the LAST episode on the disc and the only option we could do was to restart the disc from the beginning and try to fast forward.  We checked the disc for smudges/scratches and didn't see anything.  Same thing happened on the 7th disc.    I contacted the vendor (Express Media) but they don't have another copy to replace it with.  They said they'd stand by their 100% satisfaction guarantee, though and referred me back to Amazon customer service to handle a refund.  I haven't contacted them yet to follow through. If/when I get my refund, I'll buy the set again.  I don't typically like having DVDs sitting around anymore, but this series really makes me smile (and yes, sing along!)
078322947X|3.0|The story follows closely the \\"WAGES OF FEAR\\", but in its unique way of presentation. With pretty good cinematography. However, for some reason beyond me (maybe the editing and pacing,) this version does not have the high tension as the 1953 H.G Clouzot film nor is as intellectually succinct. The ending is a kind of a let-down dramatically.<br />The soundtrack music by Tangerine Dream is not as impressive nor supportive to the film as I hoped.<br /><br />Still, I think it is an enjoyable film all around. I just wish in the near future a remastered print in wide screen format is available.

B00521LTSO|5.0|While others gave it a low review I think people forget who are giving the low stars due to amazon player is messing the show itself rating.  For me the player did great, and that was on wireless.  I had no weird jerking or anything.    As for the new season,  I have enjoyed this season and hope that doctor who will be able to keep on going.  But please people do not forget when you are rating a show on amazon its not just how the player is playing but the show itself its, story, plot and chars.
4883191028|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my Japanese instructor. It is easy to use, reasonably priced, and can be used in conjunction with other related study materials. I've enjoyed using this book and recommend it to anyone looking for basic Japanese instruction.
0307595579|5.0|From the moment I picked up The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, I could not put it down! I'm an avid reader and I read this book faster than any other book I have ever read. I read the first one in about 4 days, then I read The Girl Who Played With Fire in about a Week and I am now reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest and its got me a little Sad that there will be no more tales of Blomkvist and Salander once I am finished this one. I am especially happy that I purchased the collection. The clothbound books and the box they came in are a real treasure to have on my shelf and I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of stories with a healthy balance of Political Thrills, Mystery, Actoin, and fantastic characters. Stieg Larsson certainly knew how to keep his audienceon the edge oftheir seats in print form, and that is not easily accomplished these days with the ever more prominent medium of movies and special effects. I have also endeavoured to see the movies with Noomi Rapace and Mikael Nyqvist as Lisbeth and Blomkvist respectively. The First two have been fantastic and Im sure the third will be a great conclusion. I have also decided to be enthusiastic for the English versions coming this Christmas and following years Starring Daniel Craig as Blomkvist and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth and I would encourage anyone who considers themselves a fan of this trilogy not to pass premature judgement on the english versions and keep an open mind to the story being brought to a new audience.

0757302661|4.0|I thought this book had ton of helpful natural birth preparation and lots and lots of positivity and encouragement regarding a woman's capabilities to birth. It also had some helpful hypnosis visualizations and introduced the idea of hypnosis in a friendly way -- approachable and helpful in everyday life and in birth. It was really easy to read and follow, and I enjoyed the author's personal perspective on birth from her own experiences. The book reads like a nice older friend giving you advice and encouragement.     However, after the chapters on hypnosis and childbirth preparation had passed, I felt like a lot of the content of this book was written merely to \\"bulk up\\" the book! There was a lot of droning and repetition at the end of the book. I wound up getting frustrating and tossing it aside a lot before I finally sped through the last chapters. I would have preferred more chapters on visualization techniques, relaxation techniques, or even affirmations or something.     Also, there is the confusing and non-specific idea of not pushing your baby out, of breathing a baby out instead. However, this idea was never specifically addressed so I'm still fuzzy on the idea, although fascinated.     Overall, a useful book and one I recommend to other mothers, with the stipulation that it should be skipped through according to how patient you are with drivel.

0307455874|4.0|I check this audio book from my public library. And I just finished listening to this audio book. Barack Obama narrated his own audio book. I regularly think the only person who can really do a book justice is the person who wrote it and knows just what they want each sentence to sound like.I like how he told his stories. Well done.
0553801473|2.0|I thought this was going to be the final book in the series so I was quite surprised to find the ending so up in the air.  I am so frustrated with the plot - it seemed to ramble on and on and on.  I found myself skipping quite a few pages because they were so boring.  I would have liked a crisp, clean book.  This 5th novel in the series was the least satisfactory with all the characters so unfinished.  This series is quite long enough, already.  GRRM, haven't you earned enough money without stretching the series into oblivion??
0618680004|5.0|I was raised in a fundie Mormon home. I wasn't big on Science growing up and I thought this book would be too difficult for me to understand. I was questioning my faith a few years back and this book was recommended to me by an atheist forum I was reading.    It helped me see the flaws in the way I viewed religion and helped explain basic principles that I was taught incorrectly through my religious brainwashing.    Maybe the book isn't perfect, but it was perfect for me. Even though it's a little embarrassing, having read some of the reviews on here already, there were a few words and phrases that I had to look up, but it wasn't so over my head that I didn't understand it.    I thought it was a great book. I would recommend it.
B000007VCO|5.0|Two things are hard to believe.  One, that I've been a Santana fan for over 4 years and I'm just NOW learning about a solo album he released in late 1979 called Oneness: Silver Dreams Golden Reality, and two, that such a fantastic album came at the point in Santana's career where he was beginning to place more emphasis on generic soul/pop and less on innovation concerning his latin rhythms and distinctive guitar solos.  The timing of this release is bizarre to say the least.    It's good though!  The title song is the longest track here.  Over 6 minutes long, and it's a guitar jam.  Not only that, but it strongly resembles that of \\"Flame Sky\\" from his Welcome album where he teamed with John McLaughlin.  Unfortunately it doesn't contain *nearly* the same level of intensity as that one did, but it's still a highly memorable guitar jam.  Worth hearing?  Absolutely.  He does a really good guitar trick around the 4 1/2 minute mark worth noting.  \\"Life Is Just a Passing Parade\\" resembles another Welcome track with the funky intro before quickly turning into a soulful vocal melody-driven track with a wonderful keyboard and guitar jam at the end.  This is actually another highlight because the funky rhythm and the instrumental variety is quite refreshing.    I'm not sure if \\"Song for Devalip\\" is considered a guitar jam or a guitar melody.  This is because it basically consists of a melodic guitar solo looping for a few minutes.  You can almost dance to it!  \\"Silver Dreams and Golden Smiles\\" is a little on the cheesy side thanks to the lush vocal melody, and I believe I even detect an orchestration in the background.  Eh, it's alright but it's almost hilarious the way it's sung!  It sounds like one of those traditional Christmas songs you'd be exposed to on Christmas Eve when all the radio stations switch over to 24 straight hours of Christmas music.  Obviously it's not a Christmas song, but the vocal melody is so corny you have no choice but to let out a little laugh.   Like I said though, I can't quite hate it.      \\"Transformation Day/Victory\\" begins with a REALLY cool intro that I believe is a synthesizer before immediately switching into a boogie jam focusing around piano and Santana's guitar work.  Not quite as breathtaking as the intro but hey, it's pretty good nonetheless.  Actually on repeated listens, I notice the guitar and piano are actually alternating back and forth.  It's pretty unique and puts a radically new spin on the boogie rock formula.  This song is really awesome after all.  \\"Light Versus Darkness\\" is an onimous intro before the explosive arrival of \\"Jim Jeannie\\", which consists of sparse drum fills and THEN an explosive guitar and synth jam not really any different from something the Mahavishnu Orchestra would have done from their Birds of Fire album.  It's HIGHLY enjoyable.      \\"Free as the Morning Sun\\" is another soulful ballad with richly performed latin piano work and delicate synths appearing in the background.  This song is like a fitting farewell to the Santana of the 70's as he walks into the sunset... and enters the dreaded pop years of the 80's, haha.  Well I like *some* of his 80's work.  \\"Winning\\" is an incredible pop song.  Anyway, to continue the review, \\"Cry of the Wilderness\\" is a melodic guitar instrumental similar to \\"Song for Devalip\\".  A really good one too.  It reminds me of... something I can't quite figure out.  \\"Guru's Song\\" is a quiet, harmless and melodic guitar/piano instrumental that is *incredibly* beautiful if you ask me.      Overall, fans of Welcome and Borboletta absolutely MUST own this album.   Why it slipped under the radar and has remained that way even to this very day doesn't make sense to me.  Oh well.  You can fix that problem by listening to it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was a great read. Tina Fey's sarcastic wit had me laughing out loud in places, especially in the part when she writes back to her internet \\"admirers.\\" The book was a quick read, but I thought the length was perfect. The writing was not the greatest, but I can tell that she wrote this book herself, without the help of a ghost writer as most people writing memoirs these days seem to do. I love how Tina Fey has the ability to poke fun at herself, which is why I liked her on SNL and 30 rock. 5 *****

B004M5HKIY|4.0|I am so happy that I can share my kindle with my 3 year old daughter, through the e-publishing of children's books such as this one. She loves Curious George and I am happy that the complete collection of these great stories are available for the kindle. However, the pictures (sometimes her favorite parts) are very hard to see on the small screen. While on some of the picture pages there is text, I think that if this was removed to make room for a little larger pictures (I know the screen real estate is limited), that this would be more enjoyable for her to read with me.

0451219597|5.0|I found this book to be a fast paced page turner that was as intriguing as it was exciting.<br /><br />The book opens with a failed attempt at gaining control of a Nazi communications bunker in France by a group of resistance fighters.  Some of the group is killed, but the heart of the group manages to escape with their lives.  Felicity, the main character, must go back to England to regroup, leaving her husband, Michael, in France to fend for himself.<br /><br />Felicity works with the British government to put together a rag-tag group of women who will take the bunker, therefore, severing an arm of Nazi communication.  All the while, the Nazi's are actively hunting for the leaders of the resistance group to snuff out the next attempt.<br /><br />This novel is full of action, espionage, excitement sprinkled with a little bit of sex.

B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie could possibly be the best one Pixar has put out there.  The characters are all so cute, and cleverly thought out.  For instance, Mr. The King is a reference to Richard Petty, and Pixar does just about everything but come out and call him Mr. Petty.  Owen Wilson does a fantastic job as Lightning McQueen because even though he's a famous actor, his lines aren't tired and bored.  It's almost like he enjoyed the filming.<br /><br />Could they have picked a better person for the redneck tow truck than Larry the Cableguy?  I don't believe so.  My favorite scene in the whole movie is the tractor tipping, which I can see Larry doing.  Same with George Carlin as the hippy van (it's probably the only role I've ever liked him in).<br /><br />Not only is the cast great, but the story is fantastic.  Lightning McQueen is that spoiled superstar, who happens to find himself in the middle of nowhere.  He does some bad things to the town, and now, at his disgust, is made to spend time there and repair the damage he has caused.  Because of this, he actually learns that the the \\"little\\" people of the world can actually be pretty cool, and that just because he is a celebrity, he is not the center of the universe.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|The best show seen on TV in a very long time everything else is reality show this reality show that. this show has believable characters that you instantly fall in love with.
B002E01MHY|4.0|Ignore the negative reviews. Those people just don't get it. I know that makes me sound pretentious but to enjoy a true Fulci flick like this... you have to be of a certain mind, a certain disposition.<br /><br />Along with THE BEYOND and CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, this is one of Fulci's masterpieces. It is surreal is the scariest possible way. In Fulci's films, logic doesn't always exist and I'd have it no other way. Logic = comfort and predictability. Fulci turns our world upside down by showing us just how unstable reality can be. Now, in NEW YORK RIPPER, reality is a bit more intact but the human psyche is not. In Fulci's New York, people are crazy and/or perverted as hell.<br /><br />This movie is SLEAZY. Take the sleaze factor of CRUISING and times it by ten. No, times it by twenty. It'll make you feel dirty.<br /><br />I'm reluctant to call this a giallo being this was made during the later period of the genre and it's more influenced by slasher flicks than the murder-mysteries of the late 60s/early 70s. But even for a slasher film, this is brutal, sadistic, and unsettling. The fact that we see a lot of the killing in POV of the quacking killer (yes, the killer quacks like donald duck), is even more discomforting.<br /><br />Why does the killer quack like a duck? There's a reason and it does make sense. Those who complain about it are those who are stuck in their Jason Vorhees/Michael Myers box. Killers have to be silent and stalk around. No. Some psychokillers are crazed maniacs who babble and speak. This killer is HUMAN and he's killing out of a psychological need for.... Well, you'll find out.<br /><br />Sleazy. Creepy. Nightmarish. Fulci's New York.
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|I was 12 years old when I first saw the film on the Big Screen. Now nearly 60 years later it is just as beautiful as my child's memory recalled it. The Technicolor process is gorgeous. Not a Hollywood western Technicolor of the period but an artist's Technicolor. Every actor, perfect. And, Jose Ferrer, that underestimated actor from Puerto Rico, was wonderfully cynical in the roll of Lautrec. What a brilliant performance. What dialogue. I recall reading a Life magazine feature story on the film's production and the agony Ferrer went through walking on his knees with both legs bound up.     I cannot recomment this film highly enough.

0553801473|2.0|This book went nowhere fast. Several times Martin used entire paragraphs for  nothing but naming names.  Also was a very predictable story.  Think this will be the last book of this series I read, which is really a shame as the first three books were exceptional.

0062060554|4.0|\\"Before I Go To Sleep\\" is a mystery with a really novel approach: an amnesiac heroine who has to learn her life story every day. The last part is absolutely chilling and it doesn't matter that all the loose ends are not tied up. It is a quick, summer read.
B0013DDN5M|5.0|1982 was a very good year for Metal/Rock.  Among this album, there was Iron Maiden's - Number of the Beast; Scorpion's - Blackout; Rush's - Signals; Santana; George Thorogood; Whitesnake; Accept; Ted Nugent; Rainbow; Asia, heck, I can keep going here. The point I'm trying to get out is that out of all the great albums that came out that year, this one stands out as 'arguably' THE best one. You don't have to be a metal fan to appreciate how adrenaline inducing certain songs can be, and this album was jam packed with them.<br /><br />  The question is asked often from time to time about; \\"If there was one album/disc you would give to a person to explain a genre, what would it be?\\", this would be the one used for metal (early or otherwise). The (early)genre that opened the door to the multitudes of branches it is at now a days.

0553801473|4.0|As ever, Martin has out done himself with plots, twists and more characters than can be absorbed in one reading!  If he takes another 6 years to publish the next volume, I may not live long enough to reach the end of the series!!
B003UESJHY|5.0|A movie that finally proves feel good sports movies about under dogs don't have to be clean, campy, and follow the same outlines as all the rest. The fighter is a real world gritty movie about a boxer who has to do as much fighting outside the ring as in to prove himself.    Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is a down on his luck man from Lowell Mass. Working construction he begins to plan a come back as a boxer. Trained largely by a family friend and his junkie brother, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), he begins to talk up his come back around town. When Ward's come back doesn't go as planned he nearly gives up on his dream until his new girlfriend Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams) fills the role of a supportive, loving person in his life that no one has really stepped into before. Ward is constantly in his brother's shadow and it is clear who the family favorite is. Ward's emotional battle out of the ring is tougher than the physical trials he endures during his fights.    The Fighter is a great movie that blends family, boxing, drama, and comedy perfectly. It is clear this movie always had a strong script and David O. Russell did a phenomenal job directing but the cast really brings it to the next level. Wahlberg and Bale have excellent chemistry on screen. Adams projects a strong and independent woman who isn't afraid to stare down Ward's seven sisters or his over bearing mother, Alice Ward (Melissa Leo). There is no weak link in the cast and choosing one that stands above the rest isn't easy. An amazing cast like this can carry any average movie but The Fighter is something more.    The Fighter is still an underdog story but it doesn't seem to be the same fill-in-the-blank as every other sports movie that gets churned out. The town of Lowell Mass is brought to life by the vibrant and real characters. It is not a cookie-cutter suburbia or a friendly town that holds Ward on their shoulders like in the sequel to the Rocky movies. Ward is a flawed character and his family is worse. These flaws make them characters and not just players in the game. Plenty of scenes develop the characters, the town, and the struggle that Ward had to face everyday without being over bearing or taking anything away from the plot.    An amazing story with real characters this movie isn't just for boxing fans. The sport is Ward's ambition but the fight the title refers to involves every aspect of his life.
1594744769|4.0|Quirk Books have been cheerfully producing their altered classics, which have been fun, but gimmick-y. Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (and the prequel and sequel), The Meowmorphosis, for example, rely on classics of literature for their characters and basic plots then add in elements of horror (Zombies!) or a comedic change of species (Gregor Samsa, insect no more! Now a kitten!) to breathe a different life into the stories. So, to some extent, I was expecting a humourous book in a similar vein as the above. Instead, Ransom Riggs' Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a surprisingly good novel, the only \\"gimmick-y\\" feel attached to it is from the photographs, but even they work well, and add creepy corroborative ambiance rather than humour.    This is a strange tale of old pains seeking resolution in a younger generation, secluded and hidden family history finding clarity and at least partial understanding. As a child, Jacob is enamored with his grandfather Abe's stories of his childhood living on an island in Wales with strange children with unique abilities. His grandfather offers proofs - strange old pictures of a levitating girl, or an invisible boy, his empty garments standing in the frame - but as time went on, Jacob began to believe the photos were somehow faked, and that his grandfather was only telling stories. Then his grandfather is violently attacked, and Jacob finds him in time to receive a final enigma - a date and a bizarre clue that appears to have no relation to anything. While holding his grandfather, Jacob sees someone/thing that he thinks may be the killer, though no one quite believes his description of a monster. Eventually, on the strength of his psychiatrist's advice, Jacob and his father go to the island where Abe had lived in an effort to understand the old man, and free Jacob of his anxieties and fears. Then the story begins to unfold.    Riggs' writing is excellent, and the characters are compelling. I especially like that thelead is an emotionally fragile/damaged teenager who lacks the traditional Holden Caulfield brand of extreme cynicism. Nor is he painted a hero - he's more average than anything else, and he feels very plausible, which makes a nice change.    I cheerfully give this about 4 stars, and look forward to seeing further adventures, preferably with Mr. Riggs writing them.    (I would like to add that the book has a nice heft to it (hardback edition), and the paper is impressively heavy.)
0385495323|4.0|Well-written book about history of codes. It removes the mystery off the presumably complex concepts of even most modern ciphers and demonstrates the genius and often non-mathematical insight required to break the code.    I enjoyed reading it over the week-end. Interestingly, it contains even some future-proof material, for example about crypto-currencies, which nowadays hype is about (bitcoin).

Another slap in the face for the handicapped, boo, hiss.
0553801473|1.0|I was introduced to the ASOIAF series by a friend at work. He got me to read the first book (Game Of Thrones) and I was hooked. As has been stated ad nauseum, the first three books in the series are simply amazing. I won't go into details as I would like to keep the review concise and most who are reading this already know what I'm talking about anyway as evidenced by the ratings.<br /><br />ADWD is nothing like the first three books; none of the original magic that made the first three so addictive is present in the last two books of the series.<br /><br />I disagree with some of the assertions that the problem with the book is that there is too much detail. Rich detail is fine and the first three books had it in spades. The difference with those stories though is that along with the vivid descriptions you got loads of plot development and closure to the storylines.<br /><br />But now, not only does the story stagnate, but the author also introduces several new characters that most fans of the series are not invested in. What most readers crave is some sort of resolution for the original characters - especially after six years of waiting!<br /><br />Another thing I've noticed is that it almost seems as if when GRRM can't think of anything new for his characters to do he simply sends them on a journey that never ends. It's gotten pathetic.<br /><br />It is a real shame the way things turned out with this series. As stated, I was enthralled with the first three books; as was the friend who originally turned me on to the series; but when I asked him over lunch the other day how far along he had gotten in ADWD? He confessed that he was having a very hard time maintaining focus on the story - And this from the same guy that couldn't stop talking about the first three books.<br /><br />Right after we had both finished A Feast For Crows, I told him how disapointed I was with the story and he remarked \\" Don't worry, ADWD will pick everything up again!\\" . . .  Well, no. . . Not really.<br /><br />I used to think about the characters and worry about where the storyline was going next but after the last two books I'm at the point where I no longer really care. It's a real shame that it turned out this way for a series that showed so much promise at the begining.Not really.<br /><br />I used to think about the characters and worry about where the storyline was going next but after the last two books I'm at the point where I no longer really care.

B004UXUS64|4.0|I think just about everyone looks up at the sky every so often and wonders what else is out there. Outer space is filled with so many unexplored territories that logically speaking there has to be intelligent life out there somewhere. Otherwise it'd just be a waste of space. Undiscovered planets and unimaginable life forms are only the half of it. What if there's another planet somewhere in the cosmos similar to earth? Raising the stakes a bit, what if you and everyone you knew was also on that planet in addition to earth like an alternate universe that was right within our grasps? That is essentially what makes Another Earth so interesting.<br /><br />Earth 2; that's what the planet is being called that is right within our atmosphere. They're saying another you is on that planet that may have made all the decisions you wish you had or married the person you always wish you did. Sometimes the concept of a film is really powerful. It's so powerful and so intriguing that it kind of backs itself into a corner since there's really no way the film will ever be able to follow through with a product that's quite as good as its concept. Another Earth is kind of like that. The film does its best to intertwine the stories of Earth 2 and the blossoming relationship between Rhoda Williams (Brit Marling) and John Burroughs (William Mapother) and it all comes together in a really satisfying way. But you're also left wondering what the planet would be like if we actually got to take the trip there in the film. Is animal life the same? Do they have similar technology? Are famous monuments altered at all? The questions are endless and while its best to leave these questions open ended, part of you is left wondering if some of these questions could've been answered with a larger budget.<br /><br />The soundtrack was nearly as brilliant as the concept of the film. It's a rather brilliant mix of classical and electronic music with more of an emphasis falling on the classical part since John Burroughs is a composer. Classical scores always seem to bring out the best in films and the few electronic tracks threw in a little bit of unpredictability that also strangely fit the tone and atmosphere of the film.<br /><br />The biggest weakness Another Earth has is its camera work. It feels downright amateurish at times. Things seem to smooth out a bit in the second half, but objects and people on screen start off being blurry or out of focus right from the start. So while there were a few interesting perspectives thrown in, it didn't really make up for the camera being out of position at times and wondering if the awkward camera work was intentional at others.<br /><br />Another Earth latches onto your interest right out of the gate with a rather high impact introduction and keeps that engrossing factor alive throughout its duration. The bonding that takes place between Rhoda and John takes the front seat while the hype around Earth 2 is kind of the side seat driver; you're always hearing about it but it never really becomes a factor until the conclusion. Another Earth also delivers a really satisfying ending. Thinking back on it, there really isn't another way to end a film like this. If it wasn't for the camera work that feels somewhat unprofessional at times, Another Earth would be really fantastic. An absorbing and engaging film with a unique storyline, Another Earth is one of the most thought provoking films of the year.is a composer.

B0050PYNO4|4.0|The movie is damn funny.  It you enjoyed Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, then get this one too.  I was worried about Seth Rogen playing the alien, but he does the role well.  All the supporting cast does a good job in their respective roles.  Would recommend adding this to your collection.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|It's big but it's the best budget cooler you're going to find. It keeps my i5-2500k at 32c at factory clock. There was no issues fitting it into my [[ASIN:B00336EM0W Cooler Master Computer Case RC-692-KKN2]] and I don't plan to get the acrylic window door so I don't care about how it looks. The instalation was simple and I added an additional [[ASIN:B0026ZPFCK Cooler Master Computer Case Cooling R4-L2R-20AC-GP]] to it as I plan to OC in the future. You'll need to get RAM with a low profile heat spreader like the [[ASIN:B004JO7CZO Kingston Technology Hyper X 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 Non-ECC CL9 DIMM (kit of 2) KHX1600C9D3K2/8G]] as it does hang over slot 0.  I read a lot of reviews prior to my purchase so this came as no suprise and caused no problems for me. If you are on a budget and want something better than the stock heat sync you can buy the Hyper 212 with confidence. Is is widely considered the entry level go-to 1155 CPU cooler and I can now see why first hand. 5/5 for price to functionality ratio.

159420229X|3.0|Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything is not your typical self-improvement book. In fact, it reads more like \\"Joshua Foer's (the author) Adventure into the World of Mnemonics,\\" which isn't necessarily a bad thing, had the author left out the \\"Art and Science of Remembering Everything\\" out of his title.<br /><br />If you are expecting this book to help you achieve awesome memory, you will be hugely disappointed. Though Foer does touch base on some of the techniques used by \\"professional mental athletes\\" to help them memorize amazing feats, and the history of the lost art of memorizing, at least 75% of the book is simply backdrop and quirky anecdotes of his adventure.<br /><br />For example, it isn't until literally 90 pages into the book that we are introduced to the first technique of memorizing- \\"elaborative encoding.\\" And even then, it was another 9 pages (page 99) that the technique begins to be explained. What filled in the previous 9 pages (and most of the book)? Back and forth history, theories, example after example, and whatever else this loquacious author  felt was entertaining.<br /><br />I am not bashing on the author- I find his writing style to be entertaining enough, but after awhile I just felt like screaming \\"Alright already, lets get to the meat of the subject!\\" I understand that this author wanted to make the subject interesting and in some ways he did, by making it not read like a handbook, but I got the sense that he is the type of person who just loves the sound of his own voice.<br /><br />The editor could have cut out half the book, and it would still be equally effective.

0143118757|4.0|Before reading this book I tended to think of \\"negotiating\\" as haggling over the price of a car, house, or other product. After reading \\"Getting To Yes\\" I came to understand that many, if not most, of life's conversations are really some form of negotiation. With that new perspective I really enjoyed this book and the sound, logical advice that it offers. Most of the examples were great illustrations of the concepts being communicated. \\"Getting To Yes\\" will be a permanent fixture on my desk for reference and lending to co-workers.     One concept that really stuck out with me is BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). Understanding your BATNA, that of your negotiating partner, and who's is more favorable is a critical starting point for any negotiation. It is amazing how frequently I now use this concept to determine where I stand and developing my strategy prior to starting any dialogue.    If you are able to use facts and data (remove emotions), view situations from your partner's perspective, and truly work towards mutually beneficial alternatives you will become a more effective communicator, co-worker, boss, spouse, parent, and negotiator.
B004CJB0CM|5.0|I recently ordered this DVD to assist me in my exercise regimen, along with my elliptical trainer, for my upcoming wedding. Boy, this DVD delivers what it promises as long as you are committed to achieving results and pushing yourself harder. You will feel the burn! Jillian is tough, but she makes you believe in yourself and realize that YOU CAN DO IT! I love this DVD and find it very motivational... the workouts are hard without being too strenuous, and are a great variety for strength and cardio. Can't beat the upbeat workout music as well! Highly recommended if you want to see results fast and are committed to pushing through and feeling the burn!
B0043URV8M|5.0|Okay now it's getting difficult! Just when I thought I had my favorite another movie and soundtrack come out. Again, the first track, you are so in the moment. What beautiful background music to start off the movie. Other tracks such as Harry & Ginny, Ron's Speech (which you can't truly appreciate until you listen to it, in it's entirety)....but the scene at Shell Cottage with Dobby and with that music playing in the background. Call me a softy, but I can hardly take it. Music is so important for a scene such as that one and this composer, Alexandre Desplat nails it.
0142000671|5.0|The book was an refreshing read, as well as a great movie! I had forgotten how good the book was, truly moving!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I would suggest skipping this book and just reading the cliff notes in preparation for the next.  Martin seems to need to tread water for a few hundred pages.  The books are beginning to read more like a history than a story.  Though I understand that Martin wishes to stress the uniqueness of the surprise and the minutia of everyday life, the two combine in this book to make reading a completely unrewarding experience.  It is either painstakingly describing a meal or sitting bored in a throne room or killing off characters by the handful.  It lacks the subtle balance of building and relieving tension.  It's just left to simmer.<br /><br />After awhile I stopped caring so much about the characters and the book became easier to read.  I felt unrewarded for my investments in characters or plot twists.<br /><br />There were also some odd mistakes.  For instance children only hungry for a few days were described with distended stomachs, while this actually occurs after malnutrition covering months or years.  Also in one paragraph a character is described with her hair up and the next it is falling around her shoulders.  I stopped keeping track after a dozen.<br /><br />I can't help but suspect this was a rush job and needed more tender loving care from an editor.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|Hello all,  The AKG K702s are my first pair of higher end cans, so I can hardly say I'm an audiophile. These are my impressions.  I previously used an entry level pair of Sennies (can't remember the model number, HD something or other, but they were under $100 after a discount on Amazon and are currently discontinued). Those sounded pretty good to me at the time, although they sounded pretty warm, but that is when I realized I am ok with the base level of open cans. I have also used Monster Beats for a brief period of time, and enjoyed those as well, but I wanted something less pumped up and more accurate.  Today is the first day of use of my new K702s. As have been previously mentioned by many on the internet, initially the highs were very harsh and the bass seemed pretty weak, even after having fully anticipated that these weren't gunna be head rattlers. I am pleased to say that even after only about 6 hours of burn in, I have recognized some moderate evening out of the sound. The bass seems fuller and the highs are definitely less harsh. To me at least, the mid range sounded pretty good out of the box, but you must consider I am not a very practiced listener.  I had also heard a lot about how power hungry these cans are. I also purchased a Nuforce Udac2 HP to use with these cans on my netbook, but was worried that they wouldn't be enough to drive them properly since it is a self powered USB model. I don't know about colorations and such, but the Nuforce unit I bought was more than enough to power these cans for proper volume level. Don't know if that speaks more to the cans or the DAC/Amp, but food for thought for you I guess.  Anyways, these are my impressions as somebody just entering into the high end level. I can't wait to hear these after 100, 400 and 1000 hours!
0375842381|3.0|I read all three books in this series one right after another and I'm not sure what parts are are for which book, so I'm just going to review them all together here.      And there will be ***SPOILERS****    To start off, I'm going to say that I'm not even going get involved in the anti-religion debate.   I think the series had some really great ideas and concepts that could make a great book, but it just didn't happen here.  There were lot's of big and little things wrong with the story, but there were four things that really bothered me the most.      1) One of the prophesies about Lyra said that she would betray someone and it would hurt her.  Alot of the other reviewers thought that her bringing Roger to his death was the betrayal but I don't think that's possible.  Isn't betrayal intentional?  Lyra obviously didn't mean to have him killed so it wasn't even betrayal.  The other possibility was when ditched her daemon, but that doesn't make much sense either.  I mean, if her daemon was like her soul and had the same thoughts ect. wouldn't he have understood why she was going?  Neither of them really make sense, so I don't know which one it was supposed to be or if Pullman just forgot about the prophecies all together.    2)The whole romance with Will and Lyra was really sweet and believable.  That is, until you realize they were both barely 13.  I mean, 13 is a little young to be completely in love with someone like that.  13-year-olds do not have such intense romantic feelings and relationships.  I know it's supposed to be symbolic and everything, but still, it was a little hard to swallow.    3) Um, what is dust?  Never at any point does anybody explain what dust is.  I know it has to do with conciseness, but it also seemed to be connected to Will and Lyra's love.  And after the first book, it seemed completely unrelated to the other part of the story which was the war against the Authority.  At the end, I still saw no connection at all, and I still didn't haveany idea what it was or how it was important.  It really confused me and I think it should have been better explained since it was a really important part of the story.    4) Lastly, Lyra was supposed to be Eve.  Meaning she would be tempted and decide mankind's fate. That was why the church wanted to kill her.  But she was tempted and the whole love thing happened and everything, but *nothing changed*!!  All that happened was that all the dust that was leaving in the Mulafa's world started coming back.  It didn't affect the war at all.  So was she just Eve for that one world?  Because it didn't seem to really affect anything in any of the other worlds.  And if her being Eve was just going to affect that one world why was the church so worried about her another world.  Her being Eve was supposed to be really important, but overall it didn't really change anything in the story.  It seemed kind of pointless.    Anyway, after all of my complaining, I do recommend you read it. It has really interesting things to think about, so if you can take the ideas out of the story and think about them in your own way, then it is worth reading.
B001BZGA8Y|5.0|Have been wanting a white ceramic watch for awhile but hesitated because they were too expensive. I saw this watch on a co-worker and fell in love with it. The steel & ceramic combo is beautiful. I was a bit apprehensive too because it is a man's watch but it doesn't matter, I'm a petite female and it still looks good, not too over bearing/gaudy. Overall gorgeous watch.
0553801473|3.0|This volume is certainly better than AFfC, but not by much. The story advances, but not much is resolved.<br /><br />The Good:<br />-- The John Snow, \\"Reek\\", Davos and Selmy chapters are interesting and move nicely. The stuff happening in the North is a good read that is reminiscent of the series from the good old days (i.e. GoT and CoK).<br /><br />-- The Cersei chapters (only 2 or 3) are excellent character pieces<br /><br />-- The new actors on the stage (Griff, et al.)are a really interesting twist.<br /><br />Caveats:<br />-- The Snow and Reek chapters build up and build up but leave us with no satisfying resolution. The endings feel like cheap cliffhangers rather than good storytelling.<br /><br />-- Not nearly enough Griff & Co. in Westeros - just a quick note of the arrival and that's it. Would loved to have seen this develop more.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />-- Tyrion has become Brienne! GRRM has managed to take the most interesting and fun character in the series and turned him into a self pitying bore who spends chapter upon chapter wandering around doing nothing of consequence and getting nowhere useful (just like Brienne in AFfC). This is unbelievably disappointing and utterly inexcusable. I actually found myself skipping Tyrion chapters and then coming back to them later because they were so pointless. I can't imagine having done that in any of the other novels!<br /><br />-- Daenerys and the Free Cities --  Blah Blah Blah Blah! Tons of wasted words and pages for Dany to sit around on Meereen (or wherever it is) and brood over her actions, the men she loves and hates, and the threats to her conquest. Yes, we get to see the dragons (a little bit) and we finally see Dany interact with one of them in a significant way, but My God - would someone please kidnap this girl and throw her and the dragons on the next ship bound for Westeros so we can get on with the damn story already!?!?<br /><br />Quite simply:  Martin has become far too fond of his own prose. AFfC and ADwD should have been brutally edited down and kept as ONE book published 5 years ago. This release should have been Winds of Winter.  Instead, fans have had long waits for two overwrought, plodding novels that barely resemble the brilliance of the first three.<br /><br />It pains me to say it, but at this point it is hard to recommend the ASoIaF series to newcomers knowing that the story not only remains unresolved 5 novels in (which we expected) but that the works go from masterpiece to quagmire in short order. That is an absolute shame given all the new interest in the series generated by the HBO program (which is phenomenally well done IMHO).<br /><br />All we can hope is that GRRM gets back to old form and makes Winds a worthy comeback and a gripping piece of the series. (and that he doesn't make us wait half a decade to see it.)
1594744769|2.0|Let me tell you a secret, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is actually Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.<br /><br />Yes, the book tries to pretend it is something else, embellishing itself with creepy and weird vintage photographs, but the reality is, it is nothing more than a regurgitated version of X-Men.<br /><br />Rarely do I come across a book that is as far from what it aspires to be as this one. You might expect \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" to be a mysterious, deranged, quirky, horror-filled tale, but it just isn't. The novel was clearly written around a collection of peculiar and unsettling photos, but the narrative never reaches the level of creepy of the visual materials it relies on.<br /><br />Instead, it is a mediocre at best book that should have had 10-year old as its characters instead of teens. And instead of artsy, angst-filled photographs, it should have had more appropriate pencil illustrations to go with its Monster-is-going-to EAT-you! BOO! plot.<br /><br />You don't believe me it's bad? Try reading the book or, better yet, listen to the audio version of it without the visual aid of the photos. See what you think of the writing then.<br /><br />The photos are worth looking at though.

0142418471|4.0|What invariably happens when I plump down with a John Green or David Levithan book in my hands:<br />chuckle chuckle... giggle giggle snort... BUAHAHAHA choke cough cough...<br /><br />So yes, this is why I avoid reading funny books in public. My personal sound effects would probably scare away people within a 3 mile radius or something. A teenager with a laughter-inducing book is quite a frightening combo.<br /><br />\\"Will Grayson, Will Grayson\\" is centered around two seemingly different boys with the same name whose lives become intertwined when they accidentally meet inside a questionable institution for minors. Green's Will Grayson is my favorite type of nerd. He accepts his parents advice about life in general, is in love with obscure bands like Neutral Milk Hotel, and has the tendency to describe his love life with scientific paradoxes like Schroedinger's cat. Levithan's will grayson (no capitals), on the other hand, doesn't particularly care about anything (except maybe Isaac), hangs out with emotionally deficient computer programming geeks, and is still striving to discover a niche in the overwhelming existence that is life.<br /><br />The truly amazing thing about realistic fiction is, obviously, its relatability. Sometimes I feel like the paranormal/fantasy YA I read sacrifice character depth and development for things like descriptions of magic or, oh I don't know, the history of the shapeshifter bunny rabbits. \\"Will Grayson, Will Grayson\\" contains a fantastic set of characters, each with their own happiness and woes. And that is why I adored this book. It felt real, surprisingly real. I will definitely be looking into the realistic fiction genre.<br /><br />Off on a random tangent: I'm going to start using \\"andbutso\\" in my daily speech, just to confuse the unfortunate individuals I happen to be communicating with.
B0008KLVG4|4.0|I had SPECIFICALLY searched for \\"Jaws\\" in Blu-ray. It appeared on a screen with other Blu-rays. I don't blame the seller. I SHOULD have double checked. Over all, it arrived a day late, but was packeged very securely and my states postal serevice appears to still be using mules...    If you're NOT looking for blu-ray (Hint- I gave it to mom) I really recomend this move; nicely packeged and nice dvd case to boot.
0525422943|4.0|It's possible that I harbor a sort of morbid curiosity toward angst of any kind, given the surprising amount of love I felt for this novel. Because I am not kidding when I say that the entire book is one humongous angst-fest. There's Adam's heartache and Mia's barely hidden heartache and just pain and this awful sense of detachment from every other person around them.<br /><br />And I loved every single page of it.<br /><br />If Adam had been a stereotypical male from the YA genre, we would doubtlessly have been treated to paragraph upon paragraph of whining and pining after Mia. \\"Oh, I miss the way her hair smells, the feel of her skin on mine, her beautiful lips like bright red cherries blah blah blah...\\" But Adam is stronger and just plain better than that, even if he himself doesn't think so. Yes, he wrote emo songs to vent his frustration at Mia's departure. Yes, he was basically kind of catatonic for a year afterward. But he did something about his pain. He made it a sort of productive pain, if that makes any sense. Adam did not sit around and stare into space; he became a national rock sensation instead.<br /><br />I confess, I had originally put off reading \\"Where She Went\\" because \\"If I Stay\\" wasn't phenomenal for me. Perhaps I was put off by the feeling of stasis -- the total lack of overall change -- that pervades the first novel. Well, \\"Where She Went\\" manages to retain the emotional rollercoaster from \\"If I Stay\\" and adds a lot more movement and development to the characters since Mia is, you know, no longer in a coma.<br /><br />Sigh... An author's ability to turn something simple into something so engaging and extraordinary: this is why I read.

0062112430|3.0|Seventeen-year-old Lena lives in a world where love, or amor deliria nervosa, is nothing but a disease deemed to be fatal by the government. The only way for society to flourish as it should is through complete eradication of love, and that is where the cure comes in. All inhabitants of the United States of America living within the heavily militarized border are required to have the procedure on their 18th birthday. This cure takes away all the intense feelings of love won and love lost, of fixation and obsession, and of euphoria and despair. Lena, of course, simply cannot wait for her procedure. She has always been different, set apart by her infamous and long-deceased parents who just so happened to be branded with the most shameful labels society has to offer: one is a sympathizer; the other took her own life. Lena just wants all this pain and worry to disappear, but then Alex comes into her life -- Alex, who bears the scar of the procedure on his skin. This means he is completely safe to interact with, right? Right...?<br /><br />In my opinion, Lauren Oliver's second novel, \\"Delirium,\\" was not in the same caliber as her debut, \\"Before I Fall.\\" Although Oliver's fluid writing style is still there, peppered with beautiful similes that make her books such a joy to read, the setting and plot of \\"Delirium\\" just doesn't have the originality of her first book. Thirty pages in, my mind was flashing warning signals, and the existing similarities between \\"Delirium\\" and Scott Westerfield's \\"Uglies\\" series began popping up. For some reason, I felt like Lena was, for a lack of a better word, somewhat of a bimbo. She is passive and hesitant, and her doubt about herself and the world around her can be quite annoying sometimes. I understand that most books are centered on characters that aren't special in the conventional sense but end up maturing and discovering the rebel within themselves as the book progresses. It felt like Oliver was aiming for this growth, but Lena fell short. She does indeed become more confident by the end, but the transformation process was lacking.<br /><br />The other thing about \\"Delirium\\" is the speed of its plot development. The first half of the book was a chore to get through -- almost nothing occurred. Total stasis, almost perpetual boredom. The addictive quality of a novel is a big factor for the reader's enjoyment, and the crawling pace of this book was the biggest turn-off for me.<br /><br />With all that being said, \\"Delirium\\" does have its lovely parts. Each chapter is preceded by a short passage taken from various pieces of literature that exists in the Delirium world. They give insight into the novel and are all gorgeously crafted by Oliver. The ending was quite an intense ride as well. It definitely leaves the reader wanting of the second installment of the Delirium trilogy. Overall, an applaudable addition to the YA dystopian genre.he does indeed become more confident by the end, but the transformation process was lacking.

It definitely leaves the reader wanting of the second installment of the Delirium trilogy. Overall, an applaudable addition to the YA dystopian genre.
B00275EHJG|5.0|This movie almost made me cry and I don't cry easily.  My 12 year old cried, and neither of us have ever cried while watching an animated movie.  This third installment is better than the first two movies.  That is almost unheard of as far as trilogies are concerned.  Later installments of movies are almost never as good as (and certainly not better than) the first installment.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is a great headset for gaming! It is a pretty comfortable headset. You are dishing out a little bit of dough for this, but considering the price for the quality it is a great deal.     I do want to explain this however: even though it does it have an EQ, the bass still isn't the greatest. If you're looking for some serious bass response, I think these headsets are lacking.  You can adjust the EQ to the sound that you prefer, but as far as the lower end, don't expect your teeth to rattle or your heart to pound. I have had these for a couple weeks though and after letting them wear in, the bass is better than it was first coming out of the box.     The Surround Sound: Let me tell you, for gaming, this is where it really shines! I love playing FPS and to be able to tell where your enemy is by their footsteps or even by their shooting is a great helper.  Even on some of my older games it was incredibly immersive.  The ear cups help to block sound in the first place and once you actually turn on something, you are in your own little world. I also take online classes and for the classroom setting, the surround makes it harder to listen to the lectures. The great thing is that with a flick of the switch on the headphones, it  turns off the surround.     The Mic: nothing much to say here. Just like other reviewers said, if you turn off the sidetone, you won't have problems with some of the weird noises.  I haven't had any complains when online and everyone says that they hear me crystal clear.  I think the voice morphs are stupid... I can't see myself using them, but I imagine that someone would use them or they wouldn't have put them on there.     The G-keys: they are mediocre. Aside from turning on your music or changing a voice morph, they serve no real purpose.  Don't get me wrong, they do well at working ITunes or other media players, but it's not true G functionality that you normally get on a Logitech product.     The wireless range is pretty nice. I cango pretty far from my desktop and still listen to music while working. The battery life is pretty good and the software tells you how long it will be until you can go wireless again.     I have had some wireless connectivity problems with the USB at times, but for some reason they have cleared up since then. I'm guessing some sort of problem with something else running in the background. This is probably exclusive to me, so you may not have to worry about it.     The main problem I have with these headphones is the fact that anytime you want to listen to your computer speakers, you have to unplug the usb dongle. When you turn the headphones off, there should be a switch that automatically goes to desktop speakers. (and maybe even have this as a feature that can be toggled.)     The cups for the ears are nice, but sometimes I feel like I have to let my ears out to \\"breathe.\\"    If you are hesitating at getting this earphones, then don't. They are a great product  at a great price. They were a good  at 160, now at 110, it's even better!
0553801473|4.0|The Big Showdown is yet to come, but when it does, the world shall tremble!! No spoilers included, the book is tough but worths the trouble. I discovered a new world to the other side of the Narrow Sea and some very interesting sellswords with a lot of future in the series, one can only hope! The future of Westeros seems darker and darker though, so a many a lord and sellsword and smallfolk will catch the Last Train to the Coast. And don't forget people; Winter Is Coming.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|This was a new one on me - zombies that are vampires, or maybe vampires that are zombies. Anyway, formerly human things that try to kill, and sometimes eat, every human around.  And they pretty much succeed, to the point that America has ceased to exist except as small enclaves of a few dozen or a few hundred people.    Enter the naive teenager who was picked up or maybe rescued by the zombie killer.  The real story is the killer training the teenager to survive in this brave, new world.  The classic mentor or tutor or father figure helping the youngster grow up and succeed.  Except that in this movie, to succeed is to survive another day. And to fail doesn't mean trying again, it means moving on to the next world.    But there are sub-stories along the way, intertwined.  And somehow it all works.  It really does.    Don't get me wrong, the movie is not family fare.  It is very bloody, with some of the killing being fairly graphic.  But they are, after all, only formerly human things trying to kill everyone.  No sex and no nudity, but lots of blood.    This movie is a great example of a low-budget film using relative unknown actors and pulling off something far greater than would be expected.  By the end of the movie you realize that you are really into it and never realized it.  It may not be a big-budget extravaganza but it is certainly worth your while to watch.  If you are into killing zombies and vampires, that is.
044042335X|5.0|Bad Luck And Trouble is the 11th Jack Reacher adventure. If you are not familiar with Reacher, he is an ex-MP, a wandering loner who seems to stumble into trouble - usually someone else's - in each installment. He's also a behemoth and a man of very little means, i.e. the clothes on his back and whatever cash he has in his pocket. In this book he has made the big step into the 21st century by getting a passport and an ATM card. This may not sound like much, but for Reacher, who prides himself on both his anonymity and staying under the federal government's radar, this is huge. All of this may sound contrived or corny, even Rambo-esque, but in this author's hands it all works and this book doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />To further step away from this series' formula, Reacher - a lone wolf - finds himself teamed up with his old military Special Investigation team, who reunite when some of them find themselves in deep trouble. There's some reminiscing and then investigating into the current \\"case\\" which includes murder, mayhem, DoD corruption and terrorism. (There's even a clue based on a Jimi Hendrix song. Gotta love that.) Purists may have a problem with Reacher as a team player - I didn't - and I thoroughly enjoyed this addition to the series.
B0080SSFGU|5.0|This book is a MUST READ for anybody that works in the food service industry.I hav lent it out to so many people, the binding broke, and people have bought me replacement copies.  I have read it several times, and I bet many others have as well.
B000Q6GX5Y|2.0|It would have been useful if someone had said not to buy it if you are over 25, though I think it is really pitched to 17-year olds.  The speech at the end was rousing, but otherwise it ranged from mediocre to cartoonish most of the time.  And by that I don't mean the special effects, but the level of the story.
B002MAQSJ8|5.0|It's actually amazing just how this book really does read like a novel. While some have complained about the lack of technical details and the focus on the individuals involved, I actually appreciate this. Through this book I learned a great deal about the personalities that dominated Wall Street in the 80s, as well as the firms that were dominant and those that craved a top spot but fell short.     Additionally, it provides a great view of the issues that can constantly arise at the highest levels when a huge deal is put together; one in which multiple parties hold an interest in being the ultimate winner.     While I doubt that an entry-level analyst or associate would get to participate in such events (they'd probably be in a room cranking out spreadsheets for the main decision-makers), I would say it's an important read for any aspiring investment banker (though I have not worked as an investment banker, I did conduct a good deal of research when I considered it as a career move). I would actually say it's a must-read for anyone interested in business or even history, since this captures in vivid detail a significant moment in Wall Street right before things collapsed in the late 80s. I'm sure that the egos that fueled the RJR Nabisco deal aren't much different than those that have caused other calamities since then.
0307593495|5.0|Just like the film WILD STRAWBERRIES was an extended metaphor about aging, dying and the passing of the torch, so too is THE TROUBLED MAN.  Although one is led to think that the troubled man is the naval officer in the novel, I believe that man is really Kurt. I'm not even sure this should be classed as a mystery.  Rightfully, it should be considered fiction.  In any case, I read the Wallender books one after another this August, day after day, until I was done.  They were all excellent but this was the best one.  It was the best because it was such a beautifully done meditation on closing out one's life.<br /><br />The plot is this: Kurt is 60 years old, living alone in his house out in the countryside with his dog.  His daughter Linda just had her first child, Klara.  Kurt and Linda are still both police people but this time they are involved with solving a mystery involving her in-laws, a retired naval commander and his wife. One day the husband simply disappears and then a few weeks later the wife disappears. Since Linda is busy with the baby, Kurt undertakes trying to find the vanished in-laws. Everyone he comes across in his journey is old yet the journey is interrupted by his intersection with his family, his ex-wife, who is drinking herself to death; his ex lover who has terminal cancer; Linda and her new family and no one recognizable being left at the Ystad police station.<br /><br />The vanished naval officer and his wife involves a question of spying, whether one or both of them was recruited as a spy for a super power.  However, although this is fairly well done, it is just background for following the sunset days of Kurt's life.  Kurt also has memory lapses throughout the book and is fearful that he is having the same disease symptoms his father had.<br /><br />I know various people have done tv versions of this series.

B00000JLWW|5.0|Just a few words about this DVD \\"Titanic\\", the latest version.  It was everything we were expecting from the Seller and the Movie itself.  There was great service, response and quality customer relations excercised in this sale.  Go Amazon!!!!!!!!!++++++
0439023483|5.0|Wow! This was the most exciting, engaging story I've read in a long time. I'm sure you've heard what the basic plot is, so I don't need to explain it to you. I'm not a \\"young adult\\", but I loved this book.
B004XQO90O|5.0|This movie was so good! i love the suspense, and the action! its kinda sad in a way but i love the ending.. it wasnt what i expected. Most suspenseful movie, i usually figure out with in the first 20 0r 30 mins, but not this movie.. I would definately recommend this movie to my family and friends.. So worth it :)
0553583182|5.0|I cannot say enough about this book.  I especially loved the introduction on the subconcious and the power of sleep. Great book!
1451629184|5.0|I remember reading about her disappearance years ago. Like many others, I presumed she was murdered. I would have never have guessed in a million years that she was alive but living an 18 year nightmare in Antioch, California with a deranged couple, Phillip Garrido (a criminal sex offender) and his wife, Nancy. With his parole agents, none of them ventured into his backyard where he kept his prisoner and their two daughters.    In reading this book which is a very quick read, I amazed at Jaycee's survival in the first place and her ability to explain in details sometimes the sexual abuse at the hands of your captor. In the end, I am glad that she and her daughters have moved on with their lives in a positive directions. I now know by reading her side of the story as to why she wasn't found earlier. If the parole agents had looked closer, they would have found something amiss in the first place. Why didn't they search the backyard where Jaycee and the girls were in the first place is something that they all have to answer too? The backyard is part of the house or any home in general.    Her captors kept her isolated and imprisoned in their own little world away from the outside world. She rarely ventured out without her captors or at all. She was still very much a prisoner for 18 years. I am grateful that the Garridos were wise enough to take a prison deal rather going to trial where Jaycee would have to testify about the horrid conditions of her imprisonment. She was fed, clothed, but sexually abused at her captor's hands while his wife permitted it.    One thing that bothered me about her book is the relationship that she has with her former stepfather, Carl. Granted he was no angel. Jaycee explains how he resented her for not being his daughter and treated her half-sister differently. In 18 years of Jaycee's kidnapping, Carl Probyn was the prime suspect in abduction and presumed murder. It was pretty much his own prison sentence for being strict or trying to be fatherly.     Jaycee's natural father has yet to contact her so Carl was the only father figure she had in her life until the kidnapping. When she was freed, she was worried about Carl's reaction as if she was still an 11 year old girl. A lot had happened including Carl and her mother's divorce and the suspicion of him in regards to her disappearance.     Granted, we know better now. He's innocent, totally exonerated in this case even though he was under suspicion for 18 years. I imagine that Jaycee is still in the healing and therapeutic process. I truly believe one day that she will make peace with him if she could her captors for 18 years. It was just one lingering question, I had in reading this book about Jaycee's relationship with her stepfather. Maybe it's something that she's still working out in therapy. But I think they have unfinished business about the past.    But Jaycee's story is a miracle, I keep thinking about Elisabeth Fritzl in Austria who was imprisoned by her monstrous father as a sex slave for 24 years in the basement of their home. I wonder how she is faring now herself? But Jaycee is a miracle in survival and the test of the human spirit and will, she has conquered and defeated against her captors. She has provided the necessary love and care for her two daughters.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I still like using SwiFTP better but I was impressed with how easy this was and it doesn&apos;t have a endless supply of useless options like other apps have. Very well done app, I&apos;m gonna give it a whirl next time I wanna x-fer a file.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|The Pro Elite wireless controller is not built for small hands.  It works well, but as a woman with normal woman-sized hands, this remote doesn't feel comfortable to hold.  Reaching the L1 and R1 keys required me to stretch my index fingers more than with the PS3 controller. With the regular PS3 remote, I am better able to maneuver these buttons in conjunction with the other controller elements.<br /><br />I also didn't like the feel of the grips.  It seemed like the rough surface of the grips could cause calluses with prolonged use and it also irritated my hands.  I wish the entire controller consisted of the smooth plastic that covers all the other parts of the controller.<br /><br />I liked the general placement of the buttons on this remote compared to the PS3 remote.  It's really a matter of taste more than anything though.  I thought it would be difficult to get used to, but I adapted quicker than I imagined.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this remote for men.  It's not really made for a woman.  It works though and costs a bit less than the PS3 remote, so it's worth a try.
0446563048|5.0|This book is really easy to read and gives you a lot of insight into what being an entrepreneur is all about. Tony shares tons of personal stories, decisions, and philosophy that together have shaped and defined who he is and what Zappos is today. From time to time, he also provides great quotes that inspire you and prompt you to think, reflect and even meditate. Tony is not afraid to be himself and encourages his friends, employees, and readers to do the same. I think his success can be attributed to: the habit of constantly thinking and generating new ideas, willingness to try new things and take big risks, the ability to build relationships and make hard decisions after seeking advice from the right people, and the desire to challenge himself and make the world a better place. This book is also an emotional ride, full of ups and downs and twists, and it keeps you fully engaged.     I am especially impressed by the brave decisions Tony made along the way, including taking three weeks off during Zappos' early warehouse crisis to hike and summit Mount Kilimanjaro (the tallest peak in all of Africa), which reassured him that anything is possible; selling all of his personal properties, including the loft where great memories were made, to help Zappos survive; driving from San Francisco to Kentucky to personally help solve the warehouse problem; relocating Zappos from San Francisco to Las Vegas, etc etc. I doubt I would have the guts to make the same decisions under these circumstances, but these examples certainly encourage me to take more risks and do what is right - no matter how hard it is!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Does what it says and so easy! I probably would not have purchased it before simply because I didn't know something like this was even available.  Thanks Amazon for the free app! It is well worth the regular price if you have any need to move files to/from your device to ANY computer. I like that no software is needed - great for my locked-down tight work computer. No cords. Definitely a good tool for what I need!
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, even though critics say there was poor chemistry between Depp and AJ. It was passable, but I think part of the problem was both Depp's character ... and that hair! AJ was absolutely beautiful  and had they polished him up a bit, it may have worked better. Just a few tweeks would have made this a great movie, but all that aside, it was still a enjoyable one to watch.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|After seeing it 5 times in the theater, I look forward to the dvd in order to appreciate it even more.  It is a film with all the subtleties and nuances that the word implies.  It deserves to win a bunch of awards for every aspect of its production.  It is a tribute to the human coming-of-age experience and all the challenges associated with physical survival with your mind, heart and soul intact.  It is simply, brilliant.    Mahalo Nui Loa.
1451629184|5.0|I received this book one evening and started reading it the next day.  I couldn't put the book down.  It was very well written.  I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys autobiographies.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|I am wondering if it was worth the 10 bucks I saved.  Buy them individually.  All of the books come in as one book on your reader.  Difficult to flip over to the maps (which don;t translate well on the kindle)and I find it difficult to figure out where I am in the first one.<br /><br />The books itself, well part way through A Gam e of Thrones and I am hooked!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard is much better than my stock HTC keyboard. It&apos;s so much more intuitive and has so many great small ideas that you would&apos;ve never thought would be so helpful until you began to use them.
B004NSULHM|5.0|I have to admit I did not completely get TKOL until I watched From the Basement. Only then I discovered what a fantastic piece of work this album is. it is mesmerizing to watch it being played. The fact is that every drum loop or sample I thought was what made most of the songs, are in reality, played by the band. To understand this monumental piece of work you need to watch it being played.
1600247253|5.0|You just can't go wrong picking up a Michael Connelly book or audio book! Whether it's Detective Harry Bosch or crimial defense attorney Mickey Haller, you're in for twists, turns, action and even a surprise or two. With The Reversal, you get the best of both Harry and Mickey as they team up in a \\"reversal\\" of sides for Mickey as he's asked to be the prosecuting attorney for the retrial of a convicted felon, who's been granted a second trial.  Mickey agrees with a few stipulations. One of them being he wants Harry as his lead investigator.  Throw in Maggie \\"McFierce\\" McPherson as his co-counsel, and you get sparks from all directions.    The writing is crisp, clean and witty. The story is well thought out and executed as only Mr. Connelly can do.  Never a dissappointment, I highly recommend Michael Connelly's The Reversal.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Works great & a perfect match for my D3100. Small, well made and sturdy. Appreciate the small wire and fits well in my case. Use it all the time with no failures.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|After I had ordered this DVD I was a bit hesitant on how the quality would be. I had ordered the Faces final concert DVD and was really unimpressed with the quality which was very bad! However after watching \\"Ladies and Gentlemen\\" I was totally over the top on how great the quality of not only the footage but how great the sound was. The Stones were pioneers of great sound and lighting since Get Yer Ya Ya's out! It was great to see the horn section included on this tour! My only gripe, hardly any footage of Bill Wyman! Sure, the guy hardly moved around on stage but, he was one hell of a bass player with him and Charlie (Watts) locked in as one kick ass rythem section! Now only if they'd release a full DVD of Ya ya's I'd be in Stones Heaven!!
0142419400|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss is a dreamy tale of first love. The stage is perfectly set. Anna is an American teen sent to boarding school abroad. Etienne St. Clair is a handsome and charming Parisian (well, also English and American). The story is set in Paris, the most romantic city in the entire world.    But wait. St. Clair already has a girlfriend named Ellie!    This story is delicious. Anna and St. Clair feel a strong mutual attraction. These two cannot stop thinking about each other. They are so cute!   But what about Ellie? How will St. Clair make the choice between these two girls?  The tension just adds even more zing to an already great plot.    What I adored the most about this book was how slowly the love between Anna and St. Clair grew. It was like watching a rose bud bloom ever so slowly into something beautiful. Stephanie Perkins captures that once-in-a-lifetime feeling of magical first love.  I can't wait until it happens for me someday.    RATING    5 LOVED    COVER COMMENTS    The Eiffel Tower in the background brings the setting to life. I love how Anna and St. Clair are on the bench together, but still far apart. Now, if only we could see all of St. Clair, then it would be perfect!

0061245097|5.0|This is the second book in the Night Huntress series by Frost, the sixth book ([[ASIN:B004V522XI One Grave at a Time: A Night Huntress Novel]]) is due out Sept 2011.  This book was just as good, if not better than, the first book in this series.  Cat and Bones are fantastic together and it is wonderful to see Cat as a power in her own right.  I listened to this book on audio book and the audio book is really well done.  In fact this is one of those books I would recommend listening too; the narrator gets Bones' voice spot on and does an excellent job with Cat too.<br /><br />This book starts 4 years after the first book ended.  Cat is working for a special vampire hunting division of the FBI.  She has her own team of human vampire hunters under her command.  Cat is known only by the nickname the Red Reaper in vampire circles. Now someone has found out her identity and is out to kill her.  Who will help her figure out who is out to get her?  Well after all these long years of separation Bones may be just the vampire Cat needs to hunt down the person trying to assassinate her.<br /><br />Cat and Bones were awesome together in the first book, but they are about ten times more awesome in this book.  The reunion of Cat and Bones was absolutely outstanding and just took my breath away.  Both of them are funny, sincere, and absolutely engrossing as characters.  It was fun to see Cat hold her own in fights and to watch her finally admit how much she cares about Bones.  Bones is absolutely everything you could want in a male lead and them some; he is funny, sincere, witty and just absolutely wonderful.<br /><br />Cat finally has some friends in this book and it was great to see her hanging out with her girlfriend and joking around with her FBI team.  It was nice to see she had a great support group and that her whole life wasn't hinged on her relationship with Bones.  Cat seems to be finally gaining some balance in her life and her relationship with Bones is so loving that it is fun and heartwarming to read about.  There are also a couple very steamy scenes between Cat and Bones that are exceedingly well written, very creative, and very...well...steamy.<br /><br />It's not all about Cat and Bones though; we meet some great new characters.  The plot is well done and I love how parts of the story from the first book are tied into this book as well.  The action scenes are really well done and there are plenty of them.  Things are set up nicely for the next book,[[ASIN:B001NLL8QK At Grave's End]], and I can't wait to read that one too.<br /><br />Overall a absolutely stellar addition to this series.  Cat and Bones make this series fabulous; the are so funny, witty, caring, and just fantastic as a couple.  Not only are there wonderful, creative steam scenes between them throughout; they honestly seem to really care about each other.  In addition to that the book is very well written, has an excellent and engaging plot, spectacular action scenes, and wonderful new characters.  Really there isn't anything here that I don't like.  Fans of the Anita Blake series, who have been turned off by the turn the later books in the series have taken, should definitely check out this Night Huntress series.

B0001XAOLQ|5.0|A riveting look at human beings pushed to the breaking point time and time again. No sub movie since then has not relied on Wolfgang Petersen's lessons in capturing the essence of these driven men and their machines of war. The TV version extended cut is a MUST SEE, far exceeds the theatrical, and more elaborate than the director's cut. For the first time viewing this is epic
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Outstanding!  Wonderful!  Awesome!  Acting from ALL actors outstanding.  I laughed hard and cried hard.  A must see movie.
B001P9EQH8|3.0|Ok, I'll break down exactly why I got it so you can see why I gave it luke-warm reviews.  I use a bluetooth receiver to stream to my car, and wanted something to bump the output to the aux jack a little so I didn't have to turn up my headunit as much.  Got this in hopes of allowing me to do it.  This thing really does not amplify the sound much at all.  My car has a volume control from 0 to 50.  I was able to turn the volume down maybe 3-4 clicks out of 50, so a couple dB.  For that kind of negligible increase, hassling with a battery and extra cords is not worth it.      The build quality of the device is excellent.  It is small, feels sturdy, and the built in clip is nice.  The sound it puts out is beautiful, crisp and clear to several different headphones I tried.  But the description calls it an amplifier and it really did not do much there.  I wanted to like the device, but realized I would probably have it stuffed in a drawer very soon for being more hassle than help for what I wanted.
B004FOA84A|1.0|Great puzzles but way too few levels. The ending was really unimaginative as well. Don&apos;t waste your money on this.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|excellent product.  everyone who has this bluetoth headset absolutely should get this case.  it protects it great, and even makes it easier to find where you left your bluetooth. this should make the headset last twice or 3 times as long.  If you keep your headset in your pocket, sooner or later you will probably break it.  Buy this!  Great investment!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife is amazing!! It's the most solid quality knife (fixed blade) I've ever handled. It's almost surreal to hold it or use it!! The rubber on the handle is kind of odd feeling if you're used to a wood or plastic handle. However, its a nice feeling handle and easy to use. Sharp too!! Wow! I paid $33 shipped and it came relatively quickly. Buy this knife! It's an investment.
0553801473|5.0|Sure, it's frustrating to wait six years for a book to come out, especially if during those six years one builds it up in one's mind to be the greatest book ever.  But let's face it.  Martin is as good as it gets.  Most of the perceived flaws of this book were things we all liked in the early volumes:  complicated setups and fully realized minor (as well as major) characters, unexpected plot twists, favorite characters being killed off, large chunks of real-medieval setting (and traveling).  (Remember, Arya spent much of \\"A Storm of Swords\\" wandering up and down the riverlands.)  Those who give this book one star are comparing it not to other epic fantasy (as should be done) but rather to the book they wish Martin had written, which raced the whole story to a tumultuous conclusion.  But aren't we all going to be bitterly disappointed after the last volume appears that there won't be any more?  Let's enjoy it while it lasts.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game I too had my safe game lost the first time I played. Since then I have created another profile on the game and always switch to it when I exit the game. No problems since.
0345529057|1.0|G.R.R. Martin's writing is superb. It is shame that the printers  of his books are not up to his caliber.  Half way through the first book,  the pages started to come loose.
B002NUULNG|3.0|I have to say, my library had both movies and I prefer the one without the lame CGI effects. The box misleads you into believing that this is going to be a remaster, with a redub, in mostly 3D, however the 3D that does exist does the opposite of what the same scenes intended in the originals DVD. In the original Ghost In The Shell the segments that are now replaced with CGI helped the movie to flow, while in 2.0 it causes it to stagnate and serves as an annoyance. The CGI really for 2009 isn't really on par enough to be considered Eye Candy either. Next time they should either make it ALL in 3D or none at all. I can't really complain about the ending, considering. It still had some inconsistencies, such as Matokos head floating in water, when not even 5 minutes before that her head got blown to more then just bits by the snipers thus the head wouldn't exist, it would be in a bloody mess everywhere, not floating in the river. The film abruptly leaves off with a password that they should've changed, since it's not exactly a very secret passcode when it's the project number. I have to say for some reason this just felt short and stagnant. I can't stress how much the 3D segements annoyed me. The new amber tint is not as cool as the old green tint either, I missed that from the old one. I HAVE to complain about the dub again because \\"The Puppetmaster\\" should've been female as it was in the japanese version, that is my final complaint. I want people to know that the old one was the best, and the best Stand Alone Complex oriented thing is the Video Game. The video game for SAC was great, the anime was terrible, and this movie, 2.0 does not merge well with Innocence, at least not for me, and I loved Innocence. I enjoyed the remastered video, but as I've seen other people say. Just get it for the HD Remaster of the original, and not for the 2.0 version as the 2.0 will dissapoint. I'll put this another way, I'd rather go play either the SAC game for the PS2 or the PSX Ghost In The Shell game on a PS One, rather then seeing this pos again. One last thing, I've heard people say the english audio is not 5.1 and I'm inclined to believe that as I felt I only got 2.1 out of my 5.1 surround system, consider yourself forewarned as the 5.1 audio is said to only apply to the japanese audio.
B003L77GRO|3.0|but after a few seasons Dexter and every other character, and the plots, became kind of sickening. Too much blood, too much murder. I gave 3 stars only because the acting remains fabulous...
B001F0WXY0|4.0|im twelve and i started reading this book it wasnt as  comlex as i thought it was but it was long the print on the page alone was tiny and trust me i have read long books before i read almost halfway i think but i got board of the book
0553801473|2.0|i'm halfway through, and it already deserves a five star review. the 6 year wait was worth it, i just hope he doesn't take another 18 years to finish the series!!<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />yeah.. ^^^^^^^^^ that was wrong.  i just finished the book today.  i'm not going to paraphrase the entire book or plot lines that i enjoyed/hated.  this book is, to put it simply, poorly written.<br /><br />the first 3 books left me dying to read more.  the fourth book was generally uninteresting, but i plowed through it twice and upon 2nd reading realized that the 2nd half of the book was actually worth re-reading.  this book, though i've only read it once, makes me wish i never picked up the series in the first place.<br /><br />the writing style has gone downhill, as if GRRMs voice has become a caricature of itself, and all editing has gone out the window.  i was terribly excited to see all the characters i missed in AFFC at first, and anticipated big meet-ups and possibly an explanation of ANY mystical elements thus far.  i was disappointed yet again.  to the people who are saying, \\"well it's just the 2nd half of AFFC, it's a good 'transition piece.'\\" does that mean that the 2nd half of a mediocre book should be just as (if not more) mediocre?  i guess in a strange way that does stand to reason, but GRRM [was] so good at bashing expectations!  now it seems like he's a one trick pony, using tiny cliffhangers at the end of chapters to keep us interested.  characters repeating themselves incessantly. even multiple characters having the same memories of things, verbatim..<br /><br />it would be one thing if the next book will come out next year, but as we've heard, GRRM isn't even starting the next book for another year. so it will be at LEAST 2-3 years before the next book comes out, and quite possibly a decade or more before the series is concluded.  i needed a little more out of this book to keep me interested.  sorry GRRM, but i don't know if i can

6305546789|2.0|I really like the original \\"Halloween\\" in all it's 70s glory so when I went off to college that was one of the movies I had to have. So just to let you know my review is not about the movie but how it was re-mastered.<br /><br />I HATE THIS DIGITALLY MASTERED VERSION!!!<br /><br />On the back it says \\"This is Halloween like you've never SEEN or heard it before!\\"<br /><br />That's true... You can't SEE anything! Everything is so dark and smooth looking.<br />And seeing that a lot of the scenes happen at night, if you haven't seen this movie before you would be totally lost!<br /><br />The sound quality is good and I do like the Special Features.  But overall not happy with this buy.<br /><br />If anyone knows of a Halloween DVD that's not re-mastered let me know.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I bought this weeks ago and use it all the time to move my files. Simple to use and has password protection if you are on a shared Wi-Fi. Also has automatic zipping built in for bulk file \/ directory upload \/ download.  Did not see any abusive permissions.
B00005K3NR|5.0|One of my favorite Horro movie classics!<br /><br />I've had it for years ever since I went off to college in 06 and it is now messing it. I'm not a big fan of people digitally mastering films, which this one doesn't look like it's been, but if it has good job. And the audio is good too. And still a great movie to watch<br /><br />A must buy for any Horror Fan!

0553801473|5.0|Another classic from Martin. Be warned, however, that the author continues to subvert and deconstruct so many classic fantasy tropes as he continues; hence the vocal group upset that Martin hasn't fallen prey to cliche. Even better the second time through, savor every word!
B004WOS3P4|5.0|I must preface this by stating that I am a David Cook freak and thus am biased. However, I do think I can be rational.    This CD is superb. Like all his fans I waited a long time for it and bought it June 29. I was a bit disappointed the first time I listened to it, but that disappointment has long since disappeared. I first loved hearing his incredible voice and then began to appreciate the intricacy of the music that he and his collaborators have written. To top it all off, there is a story being told that has a beginning and an end that brings you back to the beginning.    In my opinion, The Last Goodbye is not the best song on the CD and should not have been chosen as the first single. I'm afraid this song has not seduced many into hearing the whole thing, and that is tragic for David, the Anthemic and his fans. Please, people, give This Loud Morning a chance.
184317569X|5.0|I can not even begin to write the review that this book deserves.  My only regret is that I didn't read this book sooner!  If you enjoy a good love story then you MUST read this book!  The characters were so well developed and the story was so well delivered that it was virtually impossible to put it down.  In my opinion, this book deserves way more than 5 stars.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand by me is my new favorite movie because it has a great cast, it teaches you lessons of life and it has great depictions of friendship. But unfortunately your kids under 13 and 14 will have to wait because there is loads of language but mild for an r rated movie, there's a gruesome shot of the dead kid ray brower and the smoking drinking of young kids. There is also mature themes like child abuse which might upset your young ones so just wait for your kids to turn 13 or 14 for this movie
0553801473|2.0|After three fantastic books the series comparatively jumped into the toilet.  I would easily believe that the authors are totally different.  At a minimum whoever wrote the 4th and 5th books didn't have a good editor.<br />As others have noted, Martin follows the path blazed by Jordan by not finishing the story and simply builds out more settings and more characters.  The series would be better named, The Endless Story.  At this point I'm rooting for the Others.<br />Among the various woes in Dance with Dragons is the excessive quote harping, continuous stream of new characters, unwarranted new territories, excessive garment descriptions, excessive new territory custom descriptions and excessive finance descriptions.  If you are going to write a story, write a story.  If you want to write RPG game data then do that but don't call it a novel.<br />If Martin is really writing this then he needs to find a ghostwriter.  If he is using a ghostwriter now then banish him and get another.<br />This was the last Martin book I plan on buying or reading.
0553801473|1.0|This book is a weak continuation of the Song of Ice and Fire.  Never in this series have I felt this strong a desire to skip pages until this book.  (well, quite a bit in A Feast for Crows, actually, but I was much less jaded about it). Although I will read Book 6 when/if it is released, it will be mostly because of time already invested. It won't be because of the eager anticipation I felt after AGoT, ACoK or ASoS...  This plot has become over reaching and began stagnating in AFFC and it feels as though Martin has decided to DIG himself out of that hole.  He begins adding new characters 5 books into the story and spends MORE time on their mini-stories than on the characters the reader has followed thus far.  WHY???  They end up being pawns (obviously) and draw NO affection from the reader.  Some of them are so weak (Quentyn Martel) that they stop the reader in their tracks. When I turned the page and saw the chapter title \\"the Spurned Suitor\\" or \\"Victarion\\", I cringed...  What about Bran? I've waited six years to find out what Brienne said to get out of the noose. Where's Rickon?<br /><br />I have been following the thread of the completion of this book on the Web, of how GRRM's script had become too bloated and so he decided to cut it into two books AFFC and ADWD.  So disappointed was I with AFFC that I read these books back to back to get what Martin says was his original intent. (he actually says to cut the two books up then put them together in chronological order).  When I reached the end of ADwD, I said: \\"WTF???\\"  All he had to do was EDIT his bloated manuscript and he could have spared his readership six years of waiting and actually come out with a decent ADwD that would have moved his story arc on pace with the first 3 books.  Instead of cutting it down, he cut it up and added filler.  TONS of it. Who does that?  What type of product would anyone expect from such a tactic?<br /><br />The reviewers who gave this book 5 stars did it out of love.  They claim that the 1 stars voted so because \\"this book wasn't what they imagined/expected\\".  This is a load of hooey.  I/We didn't have concrete imaginings for ASoS or any of the first 3 for that matter, yet still loved them.  Yeah, I get that GRRM has a lot of world to cover and it takes pages to do that.  But as MANY people will agree, a rigid red pen and a pair of scissors would have made a Dance with Dragons or AFFC/ADwD much more palatable.<br /><br />To the five star reviewers:  Tell me that you LOVED every chapter and the character to whom it belonged.  Because I can honestly say until AFFC that I LOVED them all.that the 1 stars voted so because \\"this book wasn't what they imagined/expected\\".  This is a load of hooey.

B003UESJFG|4.0|I liked the BD, I think it's a great movie. But I think it should have more interesting extras, I think Dreamworks is maybe focussing only on the children...
1451629184|4.0|The book was alright.  The author writes very well. I was surprised at how well she educated herself. I think that I already knew too much of the story before I read it.  Not much new information. Amazon pricing and service is excellent.  I am placing another order.
B002Q9MZF6|4.0|The foremost thing to say is that this film moved me. As one previous reviewer noted, the acid test of Boheme is if one tears up as Mimi dies; I did, helped by the mainly traditional production approach and compelling singing and acting.      The film is not without a few quirks and debits, though one needs to be trying hard, I feel, to be as outraged as have been some previous reviewers. Netrebko seems to specialize in soft, feminine acting and lushly smooth singing; while this can be a bit marshmallowy, here, it creates an appealingly vulnerable character driven by her own loneliness. I cannot agree with those who were shocked by the idea that Mimi would plan ahead to cross paths with Rodolfo or that the two would make love shortly after falling in love; when considering their co-seduction within the context of Puccini's passionate music, how can these interpretations have failed to come to mind as possibilities? (And those who feel Mimi can never be the least bit calculating should check out Georghiu's Act I. A Mimi who is wholly innocent throughout the opera risks raising hapless to the point of saccharine, even for an operatic soprano role.)    Yes, some strain is discernible in Villazon's top, particularly at the finish of his most impassioned phrases. Still, his voice is able to carry his acting, which is no mean feat. Quibbling with the size of his generously sketched Rodolfo misses the significant benefits of his characterization, which paints the poet as idealistic, passionate, and temperamental--qualities which explain, and thus defuse, his later ill-treatment of Mimi. As an audience member, falling for Rodolfo as a tender-hearted romantic male lead in Act I can lead to unease in Act III when Mimi portrays him as angry, accusing, and jealous. Villazon brings to the role an edgy, youthful volatility I hadn't realized I'd been missing until I saw it in his depiction. His Rodolfo is compelling and taking.      This movie is, first, about the two principals,and, secondarily, about the production. (There is no thirdly here.) For the latter, one must consider the pros and cons of choosing to film an opera away from a stage setting. Lip-syncing to avoid an overly graphic display of tonsils is a traditional part of the movie-format choice, one that requires no more willing suspension of disbelief than do the peculiarities endemic to a live-staged operatic production. And the tight close-ups, besides being fashionable in current DVD production (see the last few years' camera work on the Met HD productions) allow some fascinating subtlety of expression, mainly on Netrebko's face but also on Villazon's. If some of the shots were other than straight-ahead--well, this is a movie. Some blips could have been avoided: The wrong-headed choice to put Mimi's apartment below rather than above the Bohemians' crosses the text jarringly without yielding any more benefit than allowing Netrebko to display her face pointing attractively upward rather than downward. And I did struggle with the thoroughly indoor setting (too far from the other action) and opulence (too far from the Bohemians' usual milieu) of the Cafe Momus.     In short, without being perfect, this film was terrifically enjoyable, largely due to the charismatic, opposites-attract pairing of Villazon and Netrebko and a production that enhanced their characterizations in some respects and got out of their way in the remaining. I trembled on the edge of giving it five stars.

0345529057|4.0|I was not familiar with George R. R. Martin until the HBO series, \\"A Game of Thrones\\".  Although some of the scenes were difficult to watch, we were hooked and lasted through the entire season.  The book is not one you can pick up at anytime and read a few pages and put down.  It takes concentration, but the reader is rewarded with the amazing imagination of Mr. Martin.  An interesting read, but set aside time to get engrossed.  Look forward to reading the rest of the series.

B0024F08RO|5.0|I've read a lot of reviews that criticize Prison Break for being unrealistic but c'mon can you name a single series that is true to life? If so, then it was probably boring as hell. 24, which was a lot like Prison Break, had enough holes to drive an 18-wheeler through but was very entertaining and isn't that what TV is all about, entertainment? If you want total realism, watch a documentary. But for edge of your seat excitement watch Prison Break, the most exciting TV series ever. Ignore the naysayers who like to dissect every episode and just enjoy the show for what it is. It's funny, but a lot of the same people who complained about the show being non-realistic also complained about the ending which was very realistic. Perhaps they would have preferred an ending more like Lost or The Sopranos. Let's face it, Prison Break is more entertaining than 90% of the crap TV masquerades as entertainment. So come on people, give this show a break.

New characters were introduced old characters were followed  new adventures were had some new characters didn't survive much to my disdain .

B004YEJGEO|5.0|It's a fun puzzle game that's challenging without being too frustrating. The components are simple - colored beams of light, mirrors, and prisms which split the light beams in two. You have to guide the beams of light to the same-colored targets. It starts out really simple and the puzzles get more complex and challenging as you go. I find it quite relaxing, since there's no time limit and you need to just experiment and think. Very occasionally there are glitches with the lasers interacting with the prisms, but nothing too bad. It's quite satisfying to plan and solve each puzzle and it's a nice change of pace from fast-paced games.
B003KGBISY|5.0|How to begin a review of Seven Samurai? Countless of commentaries, papers, lectures and more have been done for this masterwork over the past years that adding praise at this point seems utterly redundant. Still, I will have to be redundant because I need to state the great impact that this movie has been for me.<br /><br />Until recently, I've never seen Seven Samurai (but of course I've heard a great detail of it) and now looking in retrospective, buying this Criterion BD has been one of the best purchases I've ever made. While the movie is certainly long (3 and a half hors), it doesn't feel long at all. How I wish more movies could be made that despite being long, they are so great that they seem short instead of watching endless 1 1/2 hour bad films that they make these days.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple: in XVI century Japan, a poor farm village is constatntly attacked a sacked by a group of bandits. Tired of this but unable to act, the villagers hire seven \\"ronin\\" (masterless samurai) to help them protect the village in exchange of food. That's the basic plot, but all the events and intricacies of the story is what make Seven Samurai a classic. Instead of rushing to the end, Kurosawa allows his characters to grow and let us, the audience, to know them well, so we can root for them. Also, the characters are not one note but well rounded flawed human beings. Both the farmers and the samurai have virtues and flaws and they have to learn to trust and work together in order to defeat the bandits. Is spectacular to watch how, little by little, the farmers gain confidence in themseleves and prepare to battle while the samurai begin to genuinely care for this people. The most amazing is that also you will begin to genuinely care about all of them and when the final battle occurs is like you are there and wants to help them. Kurosawa magically transports to the film's world and not many films can do that.<br /><br />The cast is extraordinary with the seven actors portraying the samurai giving great performances and distinctive personalities to each one. In one word you could define them as: Kambei is \\"the leader\\", Katsushiro is \\"the rookie\\", Kyuzo is \\"the master\\", Gorobei is \\"the aid\\". Shichiroji is¨\\"the lieutenant\\", Heihachi is \\"the friend\\" and Kikuchiyo is \\"the clown\\". Of course, this characterizations are only partly true because each character has many more traits that make them more humane. It also can be said that Kyuzo is the best of them a selfish, humble master swordman, we can say that Kambei is a great human being that everyone aspire to be and that Kikuchiyo is the most human of them all and the one that the audience will relate the most.<br /><br />The scenes in Seven Samurai are shot beautifully. From a lovely shot in a mountain filled with flowers to a disturbing one featuring the destruction of an old mill, Kurosawa infuses every scene with the same depth that his characters have. The action sequences particularly the final battle is an acomplishment in cinema. Shot with three cameras at the same time, the scene is seen in various angles and from different perspectives making it a compelling, breathtaking scene. The finale, is bittersweet because is partly happy and partly tragic and leaves the audience with mixed feelings.<br /><br />Seven Samurai is an extraordinary experience that makes you see the depth of the human spirit, it also makes you see that there is always good people in the world and that friendship, trust and confidence are things that you will always need in life. A masterpiece of masterpieces.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br />Criterion went to great lenghts in restoring this film and it clearly shows in this new BD. The transfer is strong, clear and detail is amazing. Skintones look real and more film like. Some scenes have some evident signs of damage but I think that is inherited from the print and the restoration team couldn't do anything to mitigate it without compromising the image. Still, this is easily the definitive presentation of Seven Samurai.<br /><br />The linear uncompressed monoaural track has also been restored and it clearly is the best the movie have heard. The dialogue and the effects are clear, there is no distortion or hiss whatsoever in the movie. Also, you have the option to watch the film in  2.0 uncompressed sound (wrongly advertised as 2.0 DTS-HD MA in the box), this audio option is a little more aggressive but doesn't feel like it's betraying the otriginal sound in the film. Both options are great.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br />Because the movie lasts for 3 1/2 hours, the entire first disc is devoted to the film. The only suplemments in disc 1 are two audiocommentaries, one by scholars David Desser, Joan Mellen, Stephen Prince, Tony Rayns, and Donald Richie and the other by Japanese film expert Michael Jeck.<br />Disc 2, comes full of bonus goodies starting with \\"Akira Kurosawa: It's Wonderful to Create\\" a terrific documentary part of a series that Toho did for Kurosawa and othe directors for all his films, this one deals with the conception, production and release of Seven Samurai. It's great and informative. More impressive, is a conversation with Kurosawa by Nagisa Oshima, recorded in 1993, this two hour interview deals with Kurosawa's life including his childhood, how he entered the movie business, how does he approach a movie and more. It's as enlightening as it's fun.

Criterion has done an impressive work for this blu-ray and this set is a must-own for every film lover. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!f Seven Samurai.    The linear uncompressed monoaural track has also been restored and it clearly is the best the movie have heard. The dialogue and the effects are clear, there is no distortion or hiss whatsoever in the movie. Also, you have the option to watch the film in  2.0 uncompressed sound (wrongly advertised as 2.0 DTS-HD MA in the box), this audio option is a little more aggressive but doesn't feel like it's betraying the otriginal sound in the film. Both options are great.    Bonus Features:  Because the movie lasts for 3 1/2 hours, the entire first disc is devoted to the film. The only suplemments in disc 1 are two audiocommentaries, one by scholars David Desser, Joan Mellen, Stephen Prince, Tony Rayns, and Donald Richie and the other by Japanese film expert Michael Jeck.   Disc 2, comes full of bonus goodies starting with \\"Akira Kurosawa: It's Wonderful to Create\\" a terrific documentary part of a series that Toho did for Kurosawa and othe directors for all his films, this one deals with the conception, production and release of Seven Samurai. It's great and informative. More impressive, is a conversation with Kurosawa by Nagisa Oshima, recorded in 1993, this two hour interview deals with Kurosawa's life including his childhood, how he entered the movie business, how does he approach a movie and more. It's as enlightening as it's fun. Then you have a documentary called ¨Seven Samurai: Origins and Influences, in which various film scholars traces the origins of the samurai, discuss Japan in the war and again the production of the film and what were Kurosawa's influences for creating it.

0446563048|5.0|Heard DELIVERING HAPPINESS: A PATH TO PROFITS, PASSION AND PURPOSE (Hachette Audio)--written and read by Tony Hsieh.<br /><br />The author is the CEO of Zappos . . . in this fascinating account, he shows how he helped get the company to the place where it is now.<br /><br />I'm not sure all the ideas could be used by every firm, but I bet it would be both fun and interesting to try such things as:<br /><br />* Pay new employees $2000 to quit after the first week of training. Repeat this offer after each of the four weeks of training.<br /><br />* Instead of spending a lot of money on paid advertising, instead spend it on customer service.<br /><br />* Do what Howard Shultz [of Starbucks fame] did when asked how to get people to smile a lot . . . just hire people who smile. It's a lot easier than having to train somebody to smile.<br /><br />I also liked reading how Hsieh has attempted to apply research from the science of happiness to the running of his business. In fact, the book has made me want to take a tour of his company when I next visit Las Vegas to see if Zappos is as amazing as it seems in this book.
B0051CSI0G|4.0|Now this is a vampire movie.  Stake Land is an effort from director Jim Mickle, who previously helmed a bleak and understated horror flick called Mulberry Street a few years back, which still ranks as probably the best film to ever come out carrying the After Dark Horrorfest banner.  With Stake Land, Mickle presents to us an apocalyptic wasteland that the vamps are terrorizing and feeding off of.  For teenager Martin (Connor Paolo), his means of survival are being accompanied by the mysterious Mister (Mulberry Street star Nick Damici) as they come across various other survivors (including Kelly McGillis and genre stalwart Danielle Harris) and an insane religious cult while attempting to make their way to the supposedly untouched land of New Eden.  Violent, scary, and unapologetically bleak; Stake Land is the kind of horror film that we don't see much of anymore, which in itself is a crying shame.  It pulls no punches and even when it offers a glimmer of hope, it seems so far away that you will be on the edge of your seat to see if our heroes make it or not.  While the film isn't without its flaws, most notably being that various characters appear and are introduced with little in the way of character development to boot, this is undoubtedly the best vampire film I've seen in quite some time.  All in all, give Stake Land a chance, there's a reason why there's been so much hype built around it for a while now, and you won't be disappointed with what you get here either.

B0050PYNO4|5.0|There simply aren't enough movies like Paul made today.  A seethingly irreverant comedy from a collective of various comedic minds that features enough sci-fi/comic in-jokes and nods that any fan of the genre can't help but love this film.  Shaun of the Dead co-stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost star as a pair of British fanboys hanging out in the states for ComicCon, only to wind up lending a ride to a cigarette smoking, wise cracking alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen).  Paul seeks to return home after crashing on Earth back in the 40s and being used as a tool by the government, who now view him as a liability.  On their trail is a relentless secret agent (Jason Bateman) among others, which only adds to the surprisingly non-stop hilarity and occasional slapstick humor.  Paul has it all for a film: laughs, misadventures, surprises, and an even more surprising amount of heart behind it that really sets it apart from any other recent film that can fit any or all of these types of genres.  That, as well as a just plain awesome cast that also includes Kristin Wiig, Bill Hader, Jeffrey Tambor, Blythe Danner, and the great Sigourney Weaver really help make Paul shine.  All in all, you need to check out Paul at the very least, you will not be disappointed one bit.
B003UESJEM|3.0|I'll admit up front that I'm more of a book reviewer and not the greatest movie critic.  I'm not always good at distinguishing good or bad writing from good or bad acting, and I have never been able to figure out what impact the director has.  Furthermore, I know next to nothing about cinematography, so I won't be discussing things like camera angles or lighting design.  That said, in my decidedly inexpert opinion, this is a valiant attempt on the part of some very good actors to breathe life into a rather clich&eacute;d and flat movie.<br /><br />Ben Affleck plays a 37-year-old rising star salesman, Bobby Walker at a company called GTX which used to build ships, but now doesn't build much of anything.  He strolls confidently into a meeting, both on top of his golf game and on top of his world, only to find that he's greeted as one of the walking dead.  Maybe he shouldn't have blown off Sally Wilson (Maria Bello) from HR.<br /><br />Bobby is blind-sided by the unexpected blow and the only response he seems capable of is utter denial.  His experience with \\"outplacement services\\" should have told him something - the ridiculous orientation exercises wherein participants are told directly, \\"we are not an employment agency\\", the cramped and already filled cubicles filled with people who have been there for months.  But Bobby isn't deterred.  He is, after all, a hot commodity.  He's worth $160,000.  He'll have a job in no time.  At least, in his own mind.<br /><br />His practical (and practically saintly) wife Maggie sees it a bit differently and wants to make some changes.  Put the house on the market, give up the club, maybe sell the Porsche.  But Bobby won't have it.  Bobby is not a likable character - he's full of himself, spoiled, entitled and arrogant.  We're not supposed to like him.  The more he pities himself (when reality finally breaks through at all), the less we do.  But he's a reflection of the young up-and-coming professionals who were, in some ways, hit hardest by the crash of 2008.  They were people who thought that they were on top of the world and untouchable.  They thought the dream would never end, so they never saw a reason to behave as though it would.  Maintaining the image needed to constantly get ahead was more important than saving for a rainy day that would never come.  That is, until it did.<br /><br />All the characters are basically stereotypes of characters commonly found in the business world:  the ruthless, heartless CEO (Craig T. Nelson) who turns his back on even his closest friend; the caring but largely inert boss (Tommy Lee Jones) who stands helplessly by while workers are cut off by the thousands; Maria Bello, the cold and calculating HR witch; Chris Cooper, the epitome of the \\"company man\\" who's given his life to the company and has nothing else left.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the movie is rather flat and clich&eacute;d throughout, but it becomes moreso the more it attempts to redeem Bobby (and the other characters).  Bobby gradually makes the hard choices and we revel in his fall as he moves in with family, stoops to doing construction work for his brother-in-law.  But Bobby also becomes more human as he finally accepts the reality laid out before him.  He becomes a better husband.  He reconnects with his wife.  He finds time for his troubled son.  And (cue the Hallelujah Chorus here), he finally finds another job.  Sure, it pays about half what he was making, but dear Bobby has learned his lesson and all is right with the world again.  Sigh.<br /><br />The movie is enjoyable enough to watch.  It does reflect a number of brutal truths of life in the corporate world and especially about the kinds of people who inhabit (and even live for) that world.  The ending, trite though it is, gives a brief if empty uplift.  The actors turned in performances ranging from decent to excellent, especially Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />But, precisely because of the \\"feel good\\" nature of the ending, it is ultimately unsatisfying.  It's a fantasy of the way most of us would probably like the world to work, but it's certainly not the world most of us live in.  A more realistic film would have been more depressing to watch but would have the potential to be more rewarding.  It could have pointed the way toward a world beyond the corporate-controlled work-a-day world.  It could have told more truths about human nature, the state of life in this country, and the stark choices we face as a society.bably like the world to work, but it's certainly not the world most of us live in.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|Some of my all time favorite films. The restoration is what I expected for such old film's and I am not disappointed. They look better than any previous home video release.    The packaging issue appears to be resolved as well. Mine came with the booklet on the outside of the box and it was the exact same size as the box now. It was stuck to the back of the box with a little drop of that rubbery sticky stuff. It did not leave any residue and no creases or folds on the booklet. The booklet will not fit inside the box but at least it is in perfect condition.

B001FB55H6|1.0|This is the most boring Hollywood crap I have ever seen, and I have seen several really bad movies.  The anti-American themes run throughout the movie and reminds me of some propaganda the United Nations would put out. The so called heroes remind me of the flower kids from the 60's breaching peace, love, and drugs.  This movie is extremely boring and long and you can't wait for it to be over, I almost walked out before the end, which by the way made no since.  Save your money and time and do not buy this, you have been warned!!!!!!!

0393061434|4.0|Whether you're an Apple fan or not, iWoz is an engaging read about a fascinating individual. Steve Wozniak's gentle wit and childlike enthusiasm are evident throughout. Reading it, one comes away feeling almost as if Woz has been sitting with you on your front porch, chatting over a glass of tea.    Fun is a recurring and persistent theme in this book. Unlike many celebrity memoirs, Wozniak does not come across as egotistical or larger than life. In fact, he comes across as quite humble. Instead of trying to convince the reader of how great he is, Woz chooses to tell the reader about how much fun he has had doing the things he has done and invites the reader to share in it. He writes about passions that have driven him since childhood and through telling his story encourages the reader to embrace his or her own passions, achieve great things from them, and most importantly, have fun doing it.
0689832125|5.0|This is another classic I've finally gotten around to, and it did not disappoint!<br /><br />In \\"Treasure Island,\\" we sail along with young Jim Hawkins on a treasure hunt that is sure to make him, his mother, and a few honest men from his village rich. But little do they know that the friendly sailor they've enlisted as their cook is a murderous pirate, and that he's hired a crew made up of his own kind.<br /><br />What's not to love about this classic pirate tale? The imagery is spooky, the characters are colorful, and the story is packed with excitement and adventure. It's a fun \\"boy's story\\" almost on par with \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and far better than most of the paperbacks I read as a child in the 90's. (There's far more to enjoy in this single novel than in a dozen of the \\"Goosebumps\\" volumes I grew up on.)<br /><br />The conclusion seemed a bit rushed and was a little pat, I suppose (especially in regards to the fate of Long John Silver). I guess I expected a twist or an open ending, but to be fair, it didn't exactly close with \\"happily ever after,\\" either.<br /><br />As far as pleasant surprises go, I enjoyed the coming-of-age aspect of the story. Though the book spans, perhaps, a year (with the main story occurring over the course of just a few weeks), Jim sees some significant character development. He has to adapt and quickly transform from a scared kid into one daring enough to... well... you should read it for yourself.<br /><br />I wish I'd read \\"Treasure Island\\" around the age of 12 or so, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy reading it as an adult. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for adventure.
1594744769|4.0|I loved the writing, the stunning photographs, the references to historical events (especially the Tunguska event of 1908), as well as the open ending.  It's a realistic and satisfying conclusion to a brilliantly written story, one that explores very real issues in the idiom of fantasy.  We simply can't have enough literature that promotes self-acceptance.  This novel stimulates the senses, fuels the imagination, and for the open-minded reader may even inspire.  The genre is Young Adult but this is a human story through and through, apt to titillate readers of all ages.  A sequel might be wonderful, but why mess with a good thing?  Brava, Ransom Riggs.  You've written a damn good book.  More please.
B005CMGKTG|4.0|The classic Japanese anime \\"Space Battleship Yamato\\" was actually a TV series \\"Uchû senkan Yamato\\" (1974-1975) & was edited down to a 2 hour movie. It was followed by four more anime movies & two more full length TV series (Cosmic Empire & The Bolar Wars).So,if you are a fan of this genre you will probably enjoy this live action version of earth`s last chance voyage to Iscandar aboard a converted WWII Japanese Battleship.      I was looking foward to seeing this movie back in 2009 when I first heard about it & saw the teaser trailer online. Lucky for us fans the movie is not all CGI effects & no story. The pace is fast moving but does allow time for us to get to know the main characters. Yes,alot of the story was changed but it did seem to make sense why it was done. There is plenty of original stuff for the super-fans to enjoy & even some crossover stuff from the Cosmic Empire Storyline.(Super-Geek-fans will know!)     But onto the actual DVD. Yes it works in my Region 1 DVD player & yes it has english subtitles.The one I recieved however has just reasonable picture quality,alot of pixelation in the background. Definitely watchable but doesn`t seem like a high quailty transfer. Being a big fan I had to get this movie right away & if this is the only way to see it,so be it. Or maybe I just got a bad copy? Just so everyone knows.
0439023521|5.0|Great book with a strong and engaging female lead. Not exactly a light and fun read though. Fighting to the death for the pleasure of others isn't exactly a light topic, but a thought-provoking and engrossing subject nonetheless. The language of the book is relatively straight-forward (I do enjoy books that challenge with big words, but it would have taken away from the story) and allows you to get lost in the plot and plight of Catniss. She is able to describe events with vivid imagery that truly allows the reader to imagine what things look like and feel as though they are there. The author knows how to hook the reader and keep them hooked. She has mastered the tease; she ends chapters dramatically so that you'll want to read on to find what will happen and how. Very well done.

0439023513|5.0|I literally just finished this book.  And honestly...I'm practically speechless.  I normally keep a little notebook with me while I read a book I'm going to review and I write down random points that I want to make in my reviews.  Then, when I'm ready to write the review, I get my notebook, and I start to write about the different points I had picked.  Things I liked and disliked about the book, or quotes that really stood out to me.  When I finished Mockingjay, I started to go downstairs to retrieve my notebook from where I left it the night before.  And then I stopped.  I turned around and headed straight for my computer.  I didn't even need the notebook.  After turning that last page, everything I felt about the book was in my head and weighing on my heart.  I didn't need a piece of paper to tell me how I felt about the last book in The Hunger Games Trilogy.<br /><br />This book...Oh gosh.  This book caught my attention and held it just as the previous two had.  But with it being the third, I was even more eager to read faster and to learn and to see how these characters and the world around them was going to end up.  There were moments in this book where I was giggling to myself, blinking rapidly because I could feel the sting of tears coming on, or cursing out loud because I was so angry with a situation that occuring or because a character had truly pissed me off.  But don't get me wrong.  That I was feeling such anger and frustration was not a bad thing.  In reverse, it was very good.  Because it was not the writing or the author that pissed me off, it was the story and the situation because I was so deeply involved in it that I felt like I was a part of it.  Not many books can get that big of a reaction out of me.<br /><br />I stayed up late reading this book, I disappeared into my bedroom in solitary confinement for hours, and when I wasn't reading Mockingjay, I was dying to get back to it.  By the time I finished, I walked into the kitchen, laid the book on the table, and with a pouting face and teary eyes, I told my husband to go finish reading it.<br /><br />The Hunger Games will forever be a trilogy that I will come back to.  When I finish a series, I judge how great it was by my reaction when I finish the words on the very last page and sit the book down.

B004LWZW4W|5.0|The first thing I wondered was how 300 Spartan apes could defeat the combined armed forces of the world and 8 billion or so humans. The film never takes us to that point. This movie begs for a comparison to the original series as they borrow lines from it. I enjoy this aspect of remakes, but if you have never seen the original you may not be hip to them. The first thing I caught was the first chimp was called &#34;bright eyes&#34; a nicknamed the apes gave to Charlton Heston. The chimp's subsequent escape was similar to the one by Heston. Caesar was the name of the smart ape in the POTA series and likewise his first ever spoken word was &#34;no.&#34; A hose was used to punish the ape like it was used on Heston. Two of Heston's lines were spoken by the &#34;jailer.&#34; &#34;It's a madhouse!&#34; and &#34;Take your sticking paws off me you...&#34; James Franciscus played in Beneath the Planet of the Apes and James Franco starred in this one and the movie is set in San Francisco. (I am running out of similarities.)<br /><br />In the original series apes were bred to be pets because a virus had wiped out dogs and cats. This movie uses a virus to make apes smart. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) plays an excellent &#34;Sean Penn&#34; sadistic punk &#34;jailer&#34; who we all want to see die. (Forgive me, but I think he can act better than Radcliffe.) James Franco and Frieda Pinto were less stellar in their starring roles than was Heston or McDowell. Of course if they wrote them some decent lines...<br /><br />The apes in this, from what I could tell, were CG and not as life-like as British actors with make-up. The CG baby chimp was perhaps the worst of the lot. Fortunately that didn't last but a few minutes in movie time. During the ape-human conflicts I thought a hip-hop/rap soundtrack i.e. &#34;stick it to the man&#34; type of music would have worked better, (I was humming Eminem) although the producers were most likely afraid of a possible back lash.<br /><br />The movie was good, but the rave reviews are hyped. Four and a half stars at the most.<br /><br />No f-bombs, no sex, no nudity, no ape privates showing, no blood splattering, no Linda Harrison running around in a loin cloth. Violence, killing, and use of the word &#34;damn.&#34;re hyped. Four and a half stars at the most.

0061205699|5.0|Harper Lee wrote a story set in small town Alabama during the Great Depression more than twenty years afterwards in her novel `To Kill a Mockingbird.'  This novel is a favorite among high school teachers because the children in the story mature during the course of the story, and it cogently expresses empathy.    The parent of the two children, Atticus Finch, has the trial of his life during the summer of 1935.  A local Negro farmhand, Tom Robinson, stands accused of violating the daughter of an indigent alcoholic.  The Ewells are as debased by poverty as the Jeters in Erskine Caldwell's novel, `Tobacco Road.'      It seems the whole town is against Atticus Finch, and they sometimes take it out on his kids, Jem and Scout.  Part of the reason is that he is defending a black man against the accusations of a white man in the Solid South.  Atticus isn't just doing his job, he's playing to win - and he's built a pretty good case to acquit Robinson.  There's even a scene where the Old Sarum bunch, feeling the trail against Robinson might not be as stacked against him as it ought to be in the Old South, wanted to resort to vigilante justice.  Atticus finds he has some support in town - and that day - it comes from a surprising source.    Empathy is the theme of the book.  Atticus tells his children several times that they need to walk in someone else's shoes before judging them.  Because of their limited life experiences, Jem and Scout need examples - and their father is an excellent guidepost.  Sometimes, it's not as easy as you think.  In the case of Dolphus Raymond, you only really understand him when you find out the paper bag he's always carrying contains Coca Cola, not liquor as people suspect.    It does help to know some of the references in the book before reading it.  There are many Civil War generals mentioned in the novel: Braxton Bragg, Joe Wheeler, John Bell Hood, and Robert E. Lee.  Harper Lee portrays a South caught between one that's still fighting the Civil War, and another moving toward the New South espoused by Henry W. Grady.    A Lane cake is peculiar to Alabama, invented by a homemaker there around the turn of the century.  Putting shinny in it is a way to get drunk.    An amanuensis is an old word for a secretary.  A morphite - used in reference to the snowman - is a child's spelling of a hermaphrodite.  And most folks seem to believe the Mrunas are really a tribe in Africa, but it has all the feel of a morphite to me.  Could it be possible that the Mrunas are from the Cameroons?    There's no misspelling about Lord Melbourne; he was caught in a pair of sexual scandals in England in the 1830s and 1840s which are tame in comparison today.  One of them, with Lady Norton, was probably unfounded.  The other, with Queen Victoria, was a correspondence that was deemed inappropriate by advisors to the Queen.    This book meant more to me today than it did when Bugsy made us read it in high school.  Recently we had a nice discussion of the book in the Brooklyn Public Library as part of its summer reading program.  Thanks to them for holding it, and bringing this book back to our attention.
030746363X|5.0|I heard about this book on the Dr. Oz Show and read the first chapter on my Kindle and Immediately Bought it. It is great. I have lost weight with it and Have recomended it to friends. I am a Registered Nurse and I find Tim Ferris has done good research and his ideas make sense.
140003180X|4.0|Another great installment in the series. The books in this series are an easy read and enjoyable because they discuss a simpler life that still has its ups and downs.
0062112430|2.0|I'm not very sure how I feel about this book. I usually save 3 stars for books I enjoyed but wasn't crazy about... but 2 stars seems harsh... so I think I rate this 2 and 3/4.. if that makes sense. I was just very bored throughout the whole book. & I'm debating on whether I wanna read the next one since it did end on a cliffhanger which I liked. I guess I can break it down into likes/dislikes.    likes:  -I did enjoy the last 3/4 of the novel. It was beginning to be a page turner towards the end.  -I did like Lena's character. I thought she was beautifully written.  -I did like that the cliffhanger is what's making me want to continue reading this series.    dislikes:  -I'm not quite sure what I didn't like. Like I said, I just felt very bored and had to force myself to read it many times just to finish it.   -I thought it wasn't very believable. Some of the characters just seemed dumb.    Overall, I do recommend this to younger readers (13-17 maybe) but since I'm 21 I think it was just a little too juvenile for me, which is of no fault of the author.
B001I0T92Q|4.0|I bought two of these for both mine and my brother's PSP's. I wanted to more cheaply expand memory for my PSP and use microSD cards I already have lying around. Once I have a lot of game saves, emulators, ROMs and ISOs on my card, I can expand it to up to 64GB with two 32GB microSD cards and I love that. The only reason I dislike the product is because of how thin it is. It's rather flimsy, so don't bend it a lot. Other than that, it's a fantastic product.
0062060554|4.0|Wow, first and foremost, I cannot believe that this is the first book by this author. The weaving of the story and characters is really quite good. As others have stated, for me the first few chapters were a bit difficult to get into and perhaps a bit boring, but then, it was as if I had been slammed! Wow, I just kept getting pulled in deeper and deeper.    I've read a lot of thriller stuff and really didn't see this ending coming. Out of nowhere I was shocked and surprised and actually quite ticked off! LOL. I'm giving this four stars, but do have a little bit of a complaint or whine, if you will. The author spent a lot of time building and crafting the the story to an incredible crescendo, but then, for me, the ending was too short and too perfect. I think that the ending was not woven as well as the rest of the story and felt \\"rushed\\". I won't give any spoilers, but I guess I didn't like the happily-ever-after ending for this one. Sorry, just my opinion which carries no weight with the writer I would hope.     Oh, on a complete side-bar, I had the weirdest thing happen to me today as I was deeply engrossed and near the end of the book. I realized that I was not wearing my watch that I rarely take off. I looked in the most likely places that I would set it down but couldn't find it. For the life of me, I couldn't find it. For a few moments, I actually thought I should check my journal to find out if I had written down where to look for it in the morning after I read my journal. Then, I snapped back to reality. I've never been so engrossed in a book that I almost didn't recognize fiction from reality. And I don't even HAVE a journal! Wow, this will sound corny when you read it, but it is the absolute truth!      I will pursue any other writing by this author without a doubt. Adding S.J. Watson to my list of favorite authors. I'm willing for him to cloud my reality again and again.
B000FL7CAK|4.0|Overal star rating for all three seasons (storyline, drama, pace, suspension, etc.)    Season 1, 5  Season 2, 4.5  Season 3, 5    It's the best seriese for all age groups (I have two highschool kids don't watch the screen w/ parents oftern, but this series kept them stay.) Sad that Mars won't come any more, but any chance to see Season 4's script published?
1416550534|1.0|I'm so disappointed.  I thoroughly enjoyed Morton's The Forgotten Garden, but had to put this one down.  Time of death:  page 197.  I was so torn!  Getting halfway through the book is a big investment; but after reading the reviews from people who did finish and were still disappointed, I decided I'd move on.  So sad.
B0025KVLUQ|3.0|Yes, it's remastered. Yes, *parts* of it sound remarkably better than the first CD version back in '86.    But.    1) If you want to listen to it on your PC, you had better make sure you have the latest versions of Windows Media Player and/or RealPlayer downloaded or else all you'll be able so see/hear is the \\"additional features\\" that come along with this disc.  (That is...NO music)    2) And, even after that, the last glorious minute of \\"She's So Heavy\\" has been cut off !  This is a tragedy beyond words.    Those who hold \\"Abbey Road\\" as one of the greatest albums EVER will know what I'm talking about.    The remastered Beatles catalog is certainly something to invest in, (Especially from \\"Revolver\\" on up) But Beatles fans be forewarned: What you gain in sound quality you lose in the gritty, original \\"feel\\" of the original recordings.    My first response of, \\"Get rid of the old vinyl and first edition CD's has been replaced with, \\"Hold on to them tightly\\"
B004YEJGEO|5.0|This is a pretty sick game. Works great on my droid incredible, good graphics and challenging levels.I would recommend this definitely
B0059R5Q08|2.0|I read the book several times growing up and loved it. I found this movie version left too much out.
0525423273|5.0|I've only heard people raving about how good Anna is, and I was in the mood for something lighter so I picked this one up. Stephanie Perkins definitely doesn't disappoint with Anna and the French Kiss! If I had only read the description, I never would have been interested in it but it really is fantastic.<br /><br />Perkins' writing is humorous and lively, and easily captures her reader's attention. The whole story flows so well together, and it reads almost as if you were reading Anna's journal with her rambling thoughts. Normally, I find that this writing would detract from the story but with Anna it just added so much character and flavour!<br /><br />The development of both characters and relationships is wonderful; you can really feel it building and everything progresses so naturally. There's nothing forced about it.<br /><br />This is a lovely, sweet read that will really make you ache with nostalgia for those giddy crush feelings. Who hasn't felt this way as a teenager? And here we get to relive all of that with Anna and St. Clair, particularly after she realizes she's in love with them.<br /><br />Most importantly, Perkins demonstrates wonderfully powerful emotions in her novel, whether it's through the absolute confusion between St. Clair and Anna as they try to sort out their feelings, or the strength and intensity of friendship and the role of forgiveness in relationships.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss is a sweet, beautiful coming of age story that will stick with you and make it hard to forget. It is such a fun, light read and one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long time.
B005CDU1SG|4.0|Thank you, Kindle koo koos, for giving this book one star.  When I see that the one star count is so high I know you poor fools are at it again, and I get a certain perverse pleasure knowing that you are going to let the price spoil your chance to read and enjoy a fine book.    A friend of mine suggested Pillars of the Earth, and, as I usually do, I checked it out from the library.  I rate this book, which I also checked out from the library, at about the same level as Pillars, 3 and 1/2 to 4 stars.      As in Pillars, many of the protagonists are portrayed as either beautiful, handsome, intelligent, righteous, brave, clean, and reverent (well, maybe not so reverent); or as evil, deceitful, ugly degenerates.  There also are the occasional coincidence or happenstance that strain credulity. I agree with some of the critics here that both can some times be a bit hard to swallow.    That aside, I found the book very entertaining and engrossing.  Even though it nears 1000 pages, the pages flew by, so to speak.  The various story lines move apace and are nicely interwoven.  There are not a lot of wasted words and drawn out, tedious narrative.    If you like historic fiction as I do, you'll enjoy the description of the time and the various settings, such as the Welch mining village in the early 1900's.  I was raised in a small mining town in Pennsylvania where many of the people had names like Evans, Llewellyn, and Griffiths; Welch names that appear in this book.  Two of my acquaintances were called \\"Die\\" or Dai, the Welch nickname for David.  So the book had a particular appeal to me in that sense.

B003L1ZWG2|3.0|I admit it: I'm a sucker.<br /><br />  I realize this happened a while ago. I was about 12 years old, at the prime of my skiing days(right before I decided not to go pro and instead try to hit on women.) I forget what movie I was watching, but a preview came on for Aspen Extreme where these two fluorescent-clad guys were running around Aspen, Colorado, skiing off-trail, hooking up with hot, rich women, you know, good stuff that any pubescent heterosexual male would eat up.<br /><br />  The movie sucked. Well, at the time it was awesome, but looking back, yeah, it sucked. But it was a skiing movie. I COULD NOT stay away. Granted, it wasn't as cheesy as Lane Meyer winning the big race with one ski, but at least Better Off Dead was meant to be that way.<br /><br />  So, 15 years later, I get suckered in again, except this time it's a horror movie: Frozen. I expected big things, like, not wanting to ever go skiing again for fear of being mauled by a wendigo, or getting killed by a chair-lift operator who's jealous of my girlfriend. Sadly, all it made me want to do was head up to Vermont.<br /><br />  The plot is pretty straight-forward: A guy goes skiing with his best friend and girlfriend. After hustling a chair-lift operator to let them ski without a lift ticket, the three get stuck on a chair-lift, and end up trying to survive because:<br /><br />1) The mountain is closed all week during what seems like peak ski season, just because...<br /><br />2) No one checks the chair-lifts after they are shut down<br /><br />3) There apparently isn't a chair-lift operator at the top of the lift, which means the guy at the bottom is magically able to stop the lift when someone at the top has a problem getting off<br /><br />4) There is nothing wolves like more than skiing<br /><br />  Good times and hilarity ensue.<br /><br />  Besides these plot problems, the movie itself is pretty intense. People die. Blame is placed. Pasts are dug up. People try to be heroes. While there isn't much violence in the film (just your average broken legs, wolf attacks, and a scene that makes putting your tongue on a frozen metal pole seem like fun), those scenes work well as a whole, because it makes the movie more personal. They are driving forces that keep the movie interesting in the dramatic department.<br /><br />  Which leads to what this movie is: a drama/thriller, with horror devices. It's not a \\"horror movie\\". That's not a bad thing. Sure, the horror elements, while sparse, are cringe-worthy, but about midway through the movie, there's no real fear. It's kind of like that movie Alive: after you get past the realization of what's going to happen, you're not really scared. Maybe that parallel is meant to be in Frozen.<br /><br />  I did have one thing nagging at me throughout the movie. One of the actors was familiar, but I couldn't place him. Turns out, it was Shawn Ashmore, Iceman from the X-Men series. You can't make this stuff up.<br /><br />  I give this movie 3 out of 5 frozen Jack Nicholsons. It may seem high considering the review, but the effort was noble.s, and a scene that makes putting your tongue on a frozen metal pole seem like fun), those scenes work well as a whole, because it makes the movie more personal.

B00457X7XQ|5.0|If this book's scenario came true it would make the stock market jitters of the last few years look like a tiny blip on the radar, and we probably would not be reading reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that the entire anti-virus and anti-malware industry takes this stuff to heart. I also wish that PC manufacturers would not make their BIOS flashable from the PC they're installed in. That's a very dumb idea. Same goes for flashable hardware such as video cards.<br /><br />About 20 pages into the book I thought \\"when was the last time I made an off-site backup?\\".<br /><br />It's a great novel, and really chilling if you know much about computers.
B0059R5Q08|2.0|Filmmakers: Before tackling the Brontes, Dickens, Austen, and other literary classics, it would be good to familiarize yourself with this audience. We have no problem committing our time and considerable attention span to these stories. In fact, we crave it.  If you short-change us, we will be irritated. If you meddle with the context or make some needless contrivance of modernity, or attempt to inject your own dialog on feminism or make other social commentary, we will look for the nearest open carriage door in which to slam your stupid fingers.  I didn't think we could sink any lower than the 1996 Zeffirelli JE, but this considerably worse. A key aspect of this story is the plainness/roughness of the main characters.  Jane is also meant to be very small due to bad nutrition as a child. Mia Wasikowska is far from homely, and through some trick of the camera, she usually appears 6 feet tall.  She'd have been better cast as Blanche Ingram, for heaven's sake.  Bad casting can usually be gotten around if the story is intact. This thing was little more than a slideshow. Utterly flat. Jane: Miserable/aunt's house. Jane: Miserable/school. Jane: Content/Thornfield. Jane: Miserable/on the moors. Jane: Hopeful/school, etc. Don't bother with this. Watch the 2007 Masterpiece version, which is wonderful despite its happy ending (none of them can resist this fatal flaw).  It's also worth seeing the 1997 version directed by Robert Young.  While the storyline gets chewed up a bit, Ciaran Hinds' portrayal of the Rochester character is really wonderful.
B0013A1T8I|5.0|Well In Short,I Love This Movie I first saw It when it came Out I enjoyed .it so Much<br />I told Myself when It came Out On DVD i was Getting It, Well with a Move To a New City and all, It was Put on the back burner. and with a Love Of Steampunk I found a Review Of It On A Steampunk Movie Review Page, and The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen. So I Ordered Both and have watched Them at least four Times a peice,well On to My Review Of The Golden Compass. The Cast was Fantastic It was Nice to See Nicole Kidmen Play an Evil B@T#$ for once i was impressed by her in this Movie as A Actress.

0956251579|5.0|This book was informative and entertaining. The heroine is riddled with insecurities, OCD check-lists and panic attacks. I admired her however, for holding down a responsible job and getting on with her life after such tragedy, which only becomes clear in the latter 3rd of the book.<br /><br />You read both 2003 and 2008 simultaneously, so if you have issues with that, it could drive you balmy. I didn't. It was fun to get both versions of this heroine at the same time. It meant you really felt for her, understood her and rooted for her. The ex is a real villain too, dressed in sheep's clothing of course, as the best ones always are. It raised uncomfortable questions about domestic violence, and shows that it's not just an event, but a type of infestation or fungus. One that, once it has taken hold of a relationship, buries all that was once good about it, until there's nothing but bad. And one can only survive it by gaining one's freedom.<br /><br />Yes, scarily dark and deep. But there's a little romance too, which was a blessed relief from the tense and gripping undercurrent of fear. I'm not a huge fan of romance, but it added something to round off the story, to give us hope while in the darkest corners of this book, and it was not at all over-done.<br /><br />The ending comes together a tad too conveniently, but it didn't spoil the overall story one jot. If it hadn't ended like this I may have gone insane. Yes, you get that involved with the heroine.<br /><br />In all, this is a damn fine debut and an interesting read from both a dramatic point of view, and a mental health one, as it incorporated lots of well researched symptomology into characterization, as one of the main story-lines was Catherine's OCD and it's debilitating effect on her life, post abuse.<br /><br />So it entertains and informs, which can't be bad.<br /><br />I gave this 4/5 (UPDATE: 2014: originally, but as I still think about this book while I've forgotten a ton of others, I've gone back and rescored it a five.)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00APXGKFQ Finding Esta: #1 The Supes Series (Urban Fantasy Paranormal & Mystery)]]ing Esta: #1 The Supes Series (Urban Fantasy Paranormal & Mystery)]]

B000294SFW|5.0|Inferno is undebateable one of the heaviest, hard rocking albumns that Ive ever heard in the vein of pure rock and roll! Period !! It makes me want to listen to it in front of a wall of Marshall amps pegged out. I have all of the Motorhead albums every slapping one of them including all of the complimation albums. Best of, No Remorse, On Parole, Tear Ya Down, and Meltdown. Of them all this is I believe the best that Motorhead ever put to vinyl. The only thing that I would change about it is Lemmies \\" Put the bass up will ya? in the beginning of the song Fight. I would have put it at the beginning of the album. My favorite song on the album is In The Year Of The Wolf. If your new to Motorhead like pretty much I am and obviously in love with this band you have to have this CD. Make it your absolute next purchase and prepare for the onslaught! If this one doesnt kick your rock n roll keister than nothing ever will.        Motorhead's line up has had many changes throughout their 30 years of rocking the world  including guitarist fast eddie clark , brian robertson, wortzell, and now phil campbell. While each of the guitarist brought new things to the game its Phil Campbell who plies it all together in every concert. The zoomster is 100% energy on stage amping up the crowd, and kicking butt. While Mickey Dee's is a beast on the drums. 3 guys and a small wall of Marshall amps cranked to 11 its a wonder a stage hasnt collapsed. I love this band and the fact that while im head banging I can still find a lyric or a scene in a concert dvd that makes me laugh.       What Motorhead brings to the game is pure old school rock n roll fast and furious with more energy than one can almost withstand. So simple ( EVERYTHING FASTER AND LOUDER THAN EVERYTHING ELSE ). Rock on Motorheads !!!!!!!!

030745455X|5.0|I found this, the second book in the series, not quite as satisfying as the first, mainly because some of the plot elements seemed wedged into the book: they didn't seem organic. Or, perhaps, they just seemed there for the sake of moving the book forward. As near the end, when Lisbeth never stops to consider that the other side might have the same technological skills she has. In a well-plotted book, this should have entered her mind.<br /><br />Despite this, I still found the book riveting and the characters intensely interesting. The \\"Girl With\\" series is fantastic reading.
0316067938|5.0|I usually don't really take the time to get involved in books.<br />This Twilight saga---all four books are hard to put down once you start reading them. This is not my usual choice of reading--but I am so glad I picked them up. I love the way they are written and they are easy to picture in your mind. I found another world between the covers.<br />What a wonderful escape from reality. I think we all need to broaden our minds and open our hearts to new adventures and possibilities.<br />I feel no need to tell you the story as Amazon makes it so easy to look inside the books.

B003K16P3M|1.0|Unfortunately, this is promoted as a young reader book. The reading is pleasant enough. I understood Katsa and appreciate her character's growth. I don't think the promotion of premarital sex and descrying of marriage as a trap needed to be there.
0545265355|4.0|To start off, I really think that it was a decent series.  Not like Harry Potter, but way above Twilight.  It's geared towards a slightly older audience, IMO.  The first book was great! I couldn't put it down.  By the time I finished the last book, I felt that it was mostly a waste.  My main issues are 1. the ending of Mockingjay, 2. the portrayal of the male leads, 3. the pace of the last book. 1. I feel like the ending of Mockingjay was written in haste.  I had just read a trilogy and had it quickly end, giving me no real sense of closure.  The pieces didn't fall together for me the way they should have.  There were too many questions left unanswered about the three main characters. 2. The guys in this book are not written very well.  Peeta is supposedly strong, but he always seems to be the one who needs to be protected.  I wish that there could have been a couple of scenes where he was not only selfless but actually brave.  Also, I find it hard to understand why Katniss would be interested in Gale since there is almost no substance to his character.  I don't know much about him other than the fact that he is very similar to Katniss.  It's not like Twilight when there are large portions of the books devoted to both Edward and Jacob.  This is clearly a book about Katniss, but the author should have thrown more info about her love interests to make them real. I actually felt that I understood Finnick and Johanna more than the thinly written Gale.  3. The last book was such a slow read!! I kept wishing it would end already...it really reminded me about the last Twilight book in that I couldn't believe I had wasted so much time reading it.  I know that the author had to build up to the climax, but there wasn't a lot of substance to it, just a very whiny Katniss.  When I give this series a 4 star rating, it's mostly because I've never read a book like the first one.

1603580557|3.0|As the saying goes, `one should never judge a book by its cover', this is another good example of that long ago maxim.  Although the manuscript was around since 1993 prior to publishing, it holds up very well today and one would be remiss if not reading this book if you are interested in systems.<br /><br />The examples are worthy though many examples are politically charged ones whereas they were not so much when originally written.  This most likely plays into the author's previous work in 'Limits to Growth'.  Also, the beginning of the book is very-very primer material but builds layer after layer as you move thru the text.  All in, glad I had the opportunity to read this published work.<br /><br />Other works the reader my be interested in:<br />[[ASIN:B002SAUBWC Complexity : A Guided Tour]]  by Melanie Mitchell<br />[[ASIN:B002UGU3CC Deep Simplicity: Chaos, Complexity and the Emergence of Life]]  by John Gribbin

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I had this on hold in my library and it took me a few days to even start it. Once I did, it took me a few more to continue reading it. However once the story actually started it wasn't as terrible as we thought. Sure there are many cliche items in the book, sure the main character has every awesome power available to her...but who wants to read a book about a boring witch that has no powers anyway? Was some of it a but contrived, yes of course but overall the book wasn't terrible! I will read her second novel but again will check it out from the library and not purchase it myself. But if you find you have some time to kill and want something that will keep your attention then by all means check this one out at the library or borrow it from a friend, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.

Easy to unzip and very light weight and comfortable..my main criteria.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This is the story of the captivity and escape of Jack and his Ma. (Side note.. reading Jaycee Dugard's memoir reminded me of this book) The author succeeds in describing the \\"room\\" and the daily activities that make up life for Jack and Ma in the room.     Being curious, I wish there were more details surrounding the capture of Ma that resulted in her captivity. However, all in all, great read.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm one of those dorks that routinely looks up the latest must reads and peruses recommendations. So, I've heard of The Hunger Games for a while now and even received a glowing recommendation about it. However, I dismissed the book and series as for children. In addition, the book is advertised as being science fiction, which I was not a fan of.     Then, one day I decided why not spend $5 on this book. It was the best $5 I've spent in a while. There are no words to describe how much I enjoyed reading the Hunger Games. I quickly purchased the other two books in the series and read all them in the course of 3 days on the beach.     I highly recommend this book for everyone. If you want to save a few bucks, you can buy the trilogy instead of each book at once. Don't worry about not liking the series, you will love it!

B002ZG99CC|5.0|To be honest, when I saw the trailer for the The Karate Kid re-make, I immediately rolled my eyes. I thought to myself after seeing the trailer \\"Why are they re-making this movie? What's the point?\\" Well, after seeing the re-make and watching the original again, I have to add my two cents about the re-make.    Both movies are a fish out of water story; Dre (Jaden Smith) moves to China from Detroit because his mother's job requires re-location. Dre try's to understand the culture, and wants to fit in. It's like going to a different school in another city or state and trying to make new friends, while learning about what is presented before you. Of course, like the original, Dre gets into a confrontation with the school bully, who unfortunately knows Kung Fu and Dre does not. Dre is a tough kid who has street smarts, but he is also kind, understanding, and he does not back down from a challenge. Daniel is a strong teen, his mother re-located from New Jersey out to the Valley in California because of a job. Daniel is tough and strong, but he kind of borders on being the good guy and is very close to going to the dark side. He's also kind and generous, and will tell you how he feels about something. Dre is the same exact way, but the age difference is where these two characters differ; Dre is a young kid, and Daniel is a teen in high school. When your a kid, if you get into a fight, you proved yourself that you will fight back whether you win or lose, and that you don't back down; if you lose a fight, your pride as a kid is stung, but time progresses. When your a teen in high school, it's put up or shut up.     Eventually, Dre meets up with Mr. Hahn (Jackie Chan) who is a maintenance man who works in the building; Mr. Hahn is a shut-in who doesn't talk to anybody; he keeps his pain inside, and prefers to be alone. Like the first movie, Mr. Hahn lost his wife and son, very much like Mr. Miyagi except that Mr. Miyagi lost his wife when she was in labor with their son, andboth characters died, and Mr. Hahn lost his wife and son in a car accident when Mr. Hahn was driving and he lost control. Mr. Hahn blames himself for his wife and son's death. Mr. Hahn could of been someone great, but it was after the death of his wife and son that made him into the person of who he is today. Mr. Miyagi, on the other hand, he is comfortable on where he is in his life.     Again, as the movie progresses, Mr. Hahn and Dre go to the Kung Fu studio to talk to the Kung Fu teacher. The Kung Fu teacher is not as over the top as John Crease from the original Karate Kid movie; John Crease was very over-the-top as the villain, and he was pretty memorable for that role. The Kung Fu teacher in the re-make is pretty menacing; basically, he wants to prove that his way of teaching Kung Fu is the superior way over Jackie Chan's way of teaching the martial art. It is there that the Kung Fu teacher tells Dre and Mr. Hahn that his students will not bother him until the tournament.     Dre trains for the tournament with the help of Mr. Hahn. Instead of \\"Wax on, wax off.\\" it's now \\"Coat on, coat off\\". Also, I like it when Mr. Hahn actually explains to Dre on why Dre keeps on taking his coat on and off; to teach Dre that Kung Fu lives in everything that they do, how they put the jacket on and off, and how they treat people. Mr. Miyagi, on the other hand, he doesn't explain on why he had Daniel paint his fence, paint his house, sand his deck, and clean and wax his cars; in my opinion, he made Daniel do this to show him discipline and to follow through with something. Again, that's my opinion. I also like when Dre and Mr. Hahn go to the place where Kung Fu originated; that was pretty awesome, and Mr. Hahn explaining to Dre the history of Kung Fu.     Once the training is done, the tournament is on; Dre makes it to the finals with the main bully. The bully, under instruction from the Kung Fu master, break's Dre's leg. Mr. Hahn takes Dre to the back to fix what's going on with Dre. Mr. Hahn thinks that he is going to be in even more pain if he goes out there with his leg in the shape as is, but Dre wants to finish what he started. Dre does go back out, and win's the day. What's awesome is that, like the original, the students from the opposing team from the Kung Fu school actually bow to Mr. Hahn as the Kung Fu teacher looks in shock.     All and all, I honestly think that this is a really good re-make. Will it overtake the original as being the most memorable? No, but The Karate Kid (2010) does have some really good moments, just like the original one does. The re-make does not have the over-the-top bad guys, but I honestly think it is a good re-make. Thank you for reading my review. Take care.
B003EVFHYG|5.0|John Powell has created a wonderful sound-scape of music. As each movement plays I fondly recall the scenes and really realize as much as the art (Animation) drove the film the music was an excellent counter and set the mood perfectly.<br /><br />If you enjoy Film scores and orchestral pieces, then you cannot pass this album up!

B003EV6DBM|5.0|I have seen and own at least some stories of the doctor dating back to 1963. (on dvd) I have enjoyed them all or the Different INcarnations of the doctor. In this reality there is only one doctor and has many  incarnations.<br />the original show was very low budget but I loved it anyways. from 1996 on though the money spent was greater and this new INCARNATION of the DOCTOR is as good as any that came before. THe stories are wilder though I think. SOmetimes they just need to do a simple story more , still the show maintains it's roots here and it's still a cool kids show for adults. FOr those who don't like the modern show you'd freak out on the old one effects wise. But I still rate this as a great show and on blu ray the picture is greater. THere's bonus features too. I just wish they'd make longer series.  THe old show was 24 episodes per year usually. However they were half hour shows back then but still...

0393338827|5.0|Michael Lewis brings his great storytelling to the 2008 crash on Wall Street.  Lewis focuses on a portion of the characters who saw the financial crisis before it occurred and who bet against the corrupt and dysfunctional system, where subprime securities destroyed over $1 trillion in wealth.  His character development and storytelling are captivating and he even makes the jargon and sophisticated Wall Street derivatives understandable and compelling even to the layman.  There may be other books out there that tell a more complete tale, but few will be as enjoyable for such a sad and disturbing topic.  Most will find the book both persuasive and satisfying and those that wouldn't almost certainly are ultra-conservative bankers and/or traders who believe Lewis is too scathing and slandering Wall Street too much.

B000001EUN|5.0|Animal Magnetism is a gem of a hard rock/heavy metal album. If you don't own any Scorpions' music, you simply have to have this album as well as 79's Lovedrive (the album that preceded this) and 82's Blackout (the album that followed this). Though this album contains a well-balanced mix, the guitars are not quite as upfront as they are on Blackout. If Animal Magnetism had the same mix as Blackout, it would be the greatest album in the Scorpions (Mach II) catalogue.<br /><br />For the un-Scorpified out there, Scorpions were a very different band prior to 1979. From 1972-1978 the band was much more progressive and heavier in the \\"spacey-head-music\\" sense. Mach I Scorpions is a treat unto its own, but probably not as digestible in a pop sense.<br /><br />Animal Magnetism, the 2nd of Mach II's efforts, oozes all the ingredients that make Scorpions who they are: sensuality, energy, hooks and strong hard rock musicianship. To me, Scorpions are the progenitors of the hard rock \\"ballad.\\" While most bands that write ballads give you the sense that they were forced to do so by their producer and / or their label, Scorpions write ballads because that's who they are; songwriters that enjoy writing ballads. No band writes ballads the way Scorpions do because no one can sing a ballad the way Klaus Meine can.<br /><br />Ahh, but can they rock? Oh yes indeed! Animal Magnetism has the perfect blend of mid-tempo rockers (Make It Real, Twentieth Century Man,Hold Me Tight, etc.), blistering rockers (the Zoo, Don't Make No Promises) and, as mentioned, a truly tremendous, emotionally charged ballad (Lady Starlight). The solo played by Rudolph Schenker at the end of Lady Starlight is worth the price of the album itself.<br /><br />Another noteworthy element on Animal Magnetism is the fact that this is the last album on which Klaus Meine really belted out truly heavy (in the rough sounding sense) vocals (listen to Hold Me Tight and Don't Make No Promises) In fact, he may have overdone it because before the next album was done, he had to stop singing for a period of time and seek medical treatment to remove nodules from his vocal chords! Though obviously Klaus Meine's vocals remain strong to this day, he seemed to be a different vocalist after Animal Magnetism.<br /><br />Purchase and enjoy a hard rock masterpiece.as done, he had to stop singing for a period of time and seek medical treatment to remove nodules from his vocal chords! Though obviously Klaus Meine's vocals remain strong to this day, he seemed to be a different vocalist after Animal Magnetism.     Purchase and enjoy a hard rock masterpiece.
0553381695|5.0|Love this series of books, I'm already through this book and half way through third one A Storm of Swords and can't wait to get to the next 4th one. It's intense and more gory than I'd like but I can't stop reading it.I'm still routing for the Starks to win it all. These books are well written and keeps the reader in suspense the whole way through. The twists and turns are amazing and I can't help but skip ahead sometimes to see what happens next. There is always a surprise and you find yourself routing for the direwolves.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I thought this book was excellent and inspiring to say the least.  I can't believe a child of 11 years old could survive what she had to endure and come away with the out look on life that she has.  It really makes one realize that we can come thru bad things in our lives and not be bitter if that is what we choose. If anyone would have a reason to be bitter, it would be Jaycee.<br />Jaycee is a person I would love to get to know on a personal level.  I think her out on life should be a lesson to us all.<br />I loved this book and would recommend it to everyone to read.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|I am listening to the so called remixed ZZ Top Tres Hombres cd. Now I used to have Tres Hombres on Casette. When I bought it on cd I noticed the exaggerated \\"Jesus Just Left Chiiiiiiiiiicaaaaaaago\\" lyric in that song. I checked it with the ZZ Top's 1st Greatest Hits cd. The vocal is different. And there is definitely some new drum echo sound kicking in on the jam at the beginning of La Grange. So, when I get around to buying Tres Hombres, the new original mix remastered and expanded version, I'm going to be happy camper. However, I'll keep the old remixed version as well. It's nice to have both. To alter the original albums the way the \\"suits\\" did was simply uncalled for. Sure, whoever owns the recordings can do what they please, but really, fans should have been warned. This is probably the best of all the ZZ TOP cds. I don't have a lot of them, but this is the trio at their rawest. I was going to buy the older cds but I don't know if I can get the original mix on cd. I have those albums on lp but the need on my record player has seen it's better days. Anyway, thanks to whoever for restoring this classic cd. The rework was fine, but it shouldn't have been tampered with.

B002VWNID6|2.0|I love this movie but I'm very disappointed that when it reaches chapter 17, the movie stops!  You then have to get up and flip the DVD over to be able to watch the rest of the movie on the other side of the disc!
0131177052|3.0|The examples are very good, also the techniques. But, the way ideas are organized is completely crazy.For<br />the whole book there are references to techniques only explained on the LAST part.<br /><br />  For this reason, I was on the page 117 and gave up, and started to read the last chapter, and...<br />the first technique (adapt parameter), on page 325, says: \\"just use this technique if \\"extract<br />interface\\" doesn't work. But where is \\"extract interface\\"? ON PAGE 362!!!!!<br /><br />  So I went to page 362 and the text started saying that there are some tricks...the compiler<br />helps, there are many tools to implement, but: I want to know WHAT IS \\"extract interface\\",<br />and just in the middle of the chapter it is defined.<br /><br />  There are a lot of examples like this. I really liked the ideas, but in my opinion it is necessary some improvement on the way the ideas area organized.

0553801473|3.0|No one has been more adamant about the genius of George R.R. Martin than I have.  Sadly, I think he was a little off of his game on this one.  Maybe part of the problem was waiting so very long for this book.  I may have gotten too much anxiety and expectation built up over the years as I waited for this book to come.  Maybe another problem was that it seems this book was a transitional or \\"calm-before-the-storm\\" type of book.  The first three books in this series while having multiple characters and multiple storylines, usually always had at least one important story that came to at least some sort of conclusion at the end of the book.  This book was absent of any great climax.  I THOUGHT there was one coming that events seemed to be leading up to for most of the book, but that storyline abruptly dies and left me feeling cheated.<br />Don't get me wrong, the book was great!  The characters are superb.  I've grown to love many of them over the last few books.  As always, Martin does a wonderful job of telling a story through the eyes of various characters each in a unique way.  Rather than a 3rd person story that gives the readers facts and some insights into a broad range of characters, we see the events unfold via a personal viewpoint of different people.  I think it does a better job of drawing the reader in as you experience events through each person's eyes, and feel their emotions as the drama unfolds.  Sometimes we get to experience a common event through two different characters' eyes which is quite interesting.  One complaint though is that the story is almost getting too big.  The author keeps adding more characters, and I'm starting to reach my maximum amount of people that I care to keep track of.  Also, some of the names in parts of the story such as Hizdahr Zo Loraq, Skahaz Mo Kandaq, and Reznak Mo Reznak start to run together after awhile.<br />As usual with a Martin book, the world he creates is full of depth and detail.  Every kingdom, city, family,etc. has a unique feel.  It's so easy to become immersed in the story as if each place were a city that you visit all the time and every character is an old friend you've known all your life.<br />It's surely a sign of good writing if my biggest problem is that I have grown to love the good guys so much and hate the bad guys so much that I'm getting a little impatient waiting for justice to finally come.  I find myself continually hoping with each event that THIS is where the tide finally starts to turn, only to have my hopes crushed. If I look at the book as this setting in motion a string of events that will come to climax in the next book, I can be much more forgiving.  However, if the storylines continue to veer off in ever-increasing paths with no end in sight, my patience is going to begin to wear thin.  I have danced with the dragons long enough.  It's time for this song to end and let the final battle begin!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This movie was just excellent!!  The story was amazing and I give props to Bethany for continuing to surf.  I don't think I would have had the power to do that!  It's shocking that I didn't know about Bethany Hamilton before this movie though, because I am from Maui...Haha, I know she was from a different island but still, I am supposed to know this kind of stuff right?  blol.  Maybe it's because I am not a surfer *sad face*...wish I was!  I don't think the movie was trying to push Christianity on everyone like I heard some people say.  It was a story based on a true story...I believe that they were just trying to make things as accurate the the true story as possible.  So, 5 stars for this movie!!  :D  I do have one complaint but that doesn't bring down my rating...where were the Hawaiian hotties??  :D  I am sure there were a lot more local boys at the beach when the real Bethany went surfing...I would have enjoyed the eye candy in the movie.  *giggles* and I am sure the guys would have enjoyed the female eye candy.  There could have been local \\"extras\\" hanging out at the beach.  I was happy to see a local boy play Keoki...or key-oh-key as it was said in the video.  haha.
B000LPS3B2|5.0|Shutter builds slowly to a phenomenal climax. It does some really clever things with the photographed ghost theme, and is very satisfying with no loose ends.<br />There are elements you may recall from other asian ghost movies but even these ultimately may subvert your expectations. You might want to throw on a heavy jacket or a nice warm blanket towards the end. Otherwise you might catch cold from the chill.
B0058FOB2K|5.0|Ha ha. Call me a mathematical idiot, but there's my not so subtle shot at Adele. All they both did was decide to release an album they couldn't name, so they just numbered it. I'm gonna stop comparing them here. i couldn't think of a title for this review so that's the best i could come up with.    the album. Poor Beyonce. How dare you try to do something different?! The amazing thing about this album, for me, is the sound of the departure was immediate!  And i wont lie, i hated it at first. i wasn't expecting this kind of an album after i heard the ridiculously under appreciated \\"Run the world (girls)\\" and i didn't like that at all at first either. But simply, if you like 90s r&b you'll love this album. its such a throwback and yet its fresh at the same time. She's ahead of her peers here that's for sure! she won't be taking all her fans along for the ride, but that's fine.    Outstanding tracks include: i care, i miss you, start over and countdown. but really, its the first beyonce album where i love every track. even the bad one \\"i was here\\" its a song josh groban would sing, but i like it. sappy diane warren ballad or not. also, i bought the deluxe version, cuz i hated the regular versions cover. feel free to skip it though, of the remixes, only the kaskade one is worth your time and of the 3 extra songs only schoolin life is any good, but if you dont consider yourself a die-hard fan all 6 extra tracks are worth missing.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Works amazing on motorola on my motorola xoom. I have tried several apps but this one works the best for me.\n
B004K7HMJ6|1.0|Do yourself a favor and just download price tag! Jessie J has an amazing voice! She really really really can sing. the rest of these songs are so terrible. so truly truly terrible it was almost impossible to believe. She is a horrible songwriter. this is a collection of some of the dumbest lyrics ever written. i read somewhere that over in the u.k she's won...awards?! best artist, best something. i don't know how. i don't know how this album managed to achieve accolades of any kind. childish, ridiculous lyrics and not a single other memorable melody. she'll never chart in the U.S again, mark my words!
B004LROMSY|4.0|If you are looking to be entertained, this is a good series. It appears that a few of the more interesting characters may not be around for the 2nd season, but this is still worth your time. I would recommend catching it on Netflix streaming before you decide to buy it. Again, it is an entertaining show.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|Adele has an incredible voice for TODAY's mainstream music. She sings passionately, and you can tell she speaks from personal experience. And in today's impersonal, chant-driven, melody lacking, beat obsessed top forty play list, she is a nice break. But she's not a god. she's not the next Aretha Franklin. She doesn't do anything new, she takes us back in time and does an old trick, pretty well.  I have to say that sometimes, the way she phrases words makes me cringe because it sounds so affected. There are my criticisms about her.    Now, this album. It is an improvement from the first one in the sense that there are several OUTSTANDING songs. 19 just had a nice overall feel to it. However, this album has several really incredible songs and the rest, while nice, are not really that great. in fact i dont even listen to most of this album. i do however love: Rolling in the deep, Rumour Has it, Turning Tables, Someone Like you and her cover of lovesong which is really pretty/dreamlike and not \\"unnecessary\\" as i recall the rollingstone review labeling it. And set fire to the rain is a runner up, for the \\"tracks i listen to off this album occasionally\\" category. But really that's all i took away from this album. She's lacking as a truly skillful songwriter and could stand to improve. She's a talent that needs better material. But yes, there are several instant classics here, its just not a classic overall.    I know you're going to hate on me and tell me i dont understand blah blah blah. Zip your lip like a pad lock, i dont care. Adele has great potential , but i'll wager that unless someone breaks her heart even more, she won't have any new tricks on a third go around, if she ever gets around to it.

B0050PYNN0|5.0|I´m into these kinds of movies. The spoofing, the cursing (when it serves a purpose), the puns, etc. My wife isn´t. Still, she laught her head off!! It was like 1:30 minutes into the movie and she is LOTF!!    I really like the cast: James Franco, who rarely disappoints (but also, who rarely stands out, except for 127 hours), Natalie Portman, Danny Mc BRide (excellent), and so on. The special effects are serviceable, but not really amazing. The script is terrific, the action is OK but never stops, the gags are well placed. My only gripes come from not giving enough screen time to Leezar (I guess he got plenty, still) and to the Knight Elite. There were a couple of missing opportunities, (SPOILERS COMING) like when one of the knights declare its love to Franco (Fabious) or when Bride´s squire is humped by the Minotaur (one of my favorite parts! I´m a sick puppie!). Many 4 letters words are used copiously, but I´m OK (my wife, unbelievable so, was also).    I really deserved a 4, but seeing an Oscar winner like Portman (is she a friend of McBride, the only reason to do this movie, or the director, or Franco?) in tongs, really deserves a 5!

B0050PYNO4|4.0|Paul (Seth Rogan)came to Earth and like E.T. wants to go home except he isn't very wholesome nor does he Reese's Pieces. Filled with profanity, crude jokes and fall down funny moments, \\"Paul\\" won't be for someone expecting a mild family comedy (there's a good reason it's rated \\"R\\"). When Paul encounters a pair of comic book writer/illustrators Graeme and Clive (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost teamed in hilarious effect yet again)on their own road trip after Comiccon near Area 51. The trio end up being chased by Agent Zoli (Jason Bateman)in attempt to recapture the escaping alien.<br /><br />As enjoyable as \\"Paul\\" is the film isn't the best work that Pegg and Frost (\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Hot Fuzz\\") have done--it's funny and enjoyable but should be funnier with the situations that occur.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has an extremely sharp, nice looking transfer that nicely captures the \\"look\\" of the 70's science fiction films that inspired Pegg and Frost to write the film in the first place. Audio sounds quite nice with a very good surround mix.<br /><br />Directed by Greg Motolla (\\"Superbad\\", \\"Adventureland\\")does a really good job with the pacing on the film keeping it fun and entertaining. The film is filled with great supporting actors including Kristin Wiig (\\"Saturday Night Live\\"),Jeffrey Tambor (\\"Arrested Development\\"), David Koechner (\\"The Office\\"), Jane Lynch (\\"Glee\\") and Sigourney Weaver (\\"Alien\\", \\"Ghostbusters\\")who provide their fair share of hilarious moments as well.<br /><br />The special features include \\"Between the Lightning Strikes: The Making of Paul\\" a 41 minute documentary on the making of the film. The Blu-ray (the uncut version is included as well)features an audio commentary from Greg Mottola, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Bill Hader and producer Nira Park. We also get an hour of featurettes as well as a featurette on the design and creation of Paul and a gag reel among many other extras. Storyboards, trailers and TV spots round out the special features included here.<br /><br />\\"Paul\\" won't be for everyone--but if you enjoy films like \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Hot Fuzz\\" along with references to numerous science fiction films and the TV show \\"The X-Files\\", you'll enjoy \\"Paul\\".<br /><br />Recommended.veryone--but if you enjoy films like \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Hot Fuzz\\" along with references to numerous science fiction films and the TV show \\"The X-Files\\", you'll enjoy \\"Paul\\".

B004EPYZZI|5.0|This movie is one of the best that \\"hollywood\\" has ever come out with. I'd give it ten stars and two thumbs up if the rating scale went that high. I'll be frank: it focuses a lot on Bethany's faith in God, and her struggles with His will for her life. The directors spent more time trying to make this movie as accurate to her experiences as possible; to the extent that they actually filmed real surfing, choosing not to go with any of the \\"green screen shots.\\" They also had some of the actors/actresses live with the person they were playing to allow them to bond and learn more about them. @ Vince's 1 star review, he seems to be an actor who got rejected from a casting session for this movie and therefore has absolutely nothing good to say about it. Whether you are a Christian or not, I fully recommend this movie. The religious aspect of this movie is not aimed at converting anyone. It is simply depicting the beliefs of one person who suffered a tragic loss. You wouldn't let someone outside the new local restaurant, professing to be a Christian, prevent you from stopping to try the food. So don't jump to a conclusion that this is a bad movie just because some hacked off juvenile person decided to blow up about religion. Whether you are a Christian or just an average everyday person looking for a good movie, this is an awesome movie for anyone.<br /><br />I'm not religious, I just have faith in God. There is a difference.

B004SGWYW4|4.0|Good technical quality production, although a typical anime/manga jiggle work.  The plot follows through for the most part, and given that they haven't make the further episodes to make use of the various plot details set up in the first season it has some hope for improvement.  I gave it only 4 out of 5 because it was advertised as a comedy, but even viewed as a very low brow comedy it doesn't fill the bill.  So if your into the teen jiggle shoot-em-up anime/manga you will probably like it, just don't expect to get any laughs out of it.
B004BSFC6Y|2.0|I got these for my daughter when she was about 11 weeks.  They are hard to get on her feet - they don't stretch and are almost too small for her feet already.  In spite of being hard to get on, she managed to kick them off in a matter of minutes.  She never even noticed them and has since \\"discovered\\" her feet on her own.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I purchased this because my Acer came with docs to go free version.  Turns out, this key won't work with the pre-existing one, I cannot delete the pre-existing one, and I don't trust google checkout for upgrading through them.  I'm out the money paid as I cannot find a location for 'returns' for this - not a happy camper.
B003JBI2KM|2.0|I generally have found this book to be poor.  The whole reason for buying the electronic edition was to make things easy to find, and that feature works ok.  Quirks of the soft-copy edition, however, include the fact that the page numbers cited in the glossary are useless because there are no page numbers.  Additionally, if you want information on something pretty routine in homebrewing called \\"cold crashing\\", there is none.  No mention of it at all.  Generally, a substandard book that I wish I had not paid money for.

B00004Z459|5.0|I remember that I bought this album back years ago and I still listen to the songs. Tracks one through eleven are all amazing. Usually I would buy an album and skip certain songs on it because not all the songs appealed to me, but in this album nearly all the songs were great. This rap-rock style is very catchy and I would definitely recommend anyone to check out this album. Some of Lincoln Park's newer stuff isn't so good - not as good as this classic hit.     Definitely worth the money.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I'm a big kid at heart, so when I saw the trailer for this movie, I figured, it looks good. little did I know that I would LOVE this movie so much, I would watch it enough to know the movie word for word. My grandbaby, who is 15 months old watches it everyday, she is her grandmother's child. The music is very nice, the characters each have a personality all their own. It's funny and touching, and has a lesson within. I recommend this movie to young and old.

B001HDO4YW|5.0|I really enjoy owning this album on vinyl, and this is a high quality printing.  It comes on either 180 gram or 200 gram (not sure which, but it's a heavy pressing), and the cover sleeve is very nice with a matte finish and a great texture.  The inside record slip sleeve is decorated with a series of great photos of the band.  My local record store charges nearly $35 for this album, so I was happy to pick it up from Oldies (oldies.com on Amazon) for cheap!  Sounds great, looks great.  I'm sure you can listen to the sample tracks somewhere, so I won't comment on the music too much...it's a few additional songs and alternate versions of Viva La Vida songs that are a great addition to any Coldplay collection.
1423101502|5.0|The always-reliable Rick Riordan closes his first Camp Half-Blood series with a rip-roaring ending that will even captivate adult readers and breezily sets up a new series as Percy rides (actually, runs) off into the sunset, having met and overcome his challenges with his usual aw-shucks elan.

B004HO6I4M|1.0|Graphics/animation quality: First hint, of Saturday cartoon level animation is that the background has no life. It's unvaryingly the same - clouds/leaves/trees don't move/change, or do anything but look the same flat 2D. Second hint, is the overuse of repeated shape such as the same bird being used repeatedly in the same scene. Third hint, the overuse of big eyes and mostly eye/mouth movement to sell the character and not much else. Fourth hint, lots of flat plastic like featureless bodies and faces. Even the hair looks and moves like a nylon cleaning duster. Fifth hint, the overall storyboard quality resembled more a 3rd graders attempt at story drawing than a professional work. Witness the difference in animation quality between this movie and Rango. Sometimes animators get too stuck into the animation software so that the end result seems \\"too computerish\\".     Storyline: Same old animal (cat, dot, whatever) ends up with humans either accidentally or via the kidnapped route and faces the challenge of returning home despite bad humans and evil some other critter. Not creative - boring because the same story has been in the studio repeat mode for the past decade or so. The story was too predictable throughout the movie. Just another quick 'n easy dollar as the sole motivation for creating Rio.     Script: Simplistic and dumbed down. Nothing intelligent, no allusions, no parodies, just nothing new. Even the music seemed like pointless filler as if the script needed dancing/singing animals to make the story have some energy. To make it worse the dance movements are almost identical to what was used in other animations by this studio.     Voices: Bland, no imagination. Voices sounded more like humans, sounding like humans and not the more challenging putting yourself in the place of the critter and imagining how that animal would converse. And the use of a usually wacky African-American urban slang voiced character, which has become incresingly common in animations, borders on racist stereotyping.

B000YABYLA|2.0|Juno was not an independent film, regardless of how good it may have been. When the directro is the son of another famous Hollywood director and uses those connections to bring tremendous star power to his file, calling it an \\"independent film\\" is ridiculous. It may have been an OK film (the ridiculously fake language like \\"Homeskillet\\" really brings down the rating), but it is in now way \\"Independent.\\" Juno brought huge star power to the the movie. Jennifer Garner was almost A-list at the time, Ellen Page was getting a lot of notice from being the object of the film version of the internet meme \\"I'm the Juggernaut B****!\\" line from X-Men 3, Cerra and Bateman were quite popular due to their involvement in Ron Howard's \\"Arreseted Development\\", JK Simmons was coming off of the Spider-Man series and very recognizable.     Entering Juno in IFF's was like an amateur boxer loading his gloves with lead. It was unfair in the extreme and should not have been allowed. If you can bring that kind of star power and \\"name\\" recognition to your film, go compete in the Oscars and leave the IFFs to the people making truly independent films.

B0055OK2T0|5.0|I guess this movie came at a time when a college woman re-entered my life. We both are thankful that things have come full circle, so this movie was a celebratory triumph of 'love prevails'. Too often we are faced with the 'gut kick' or 'slap back to reality' instead of the purity/hope that someone will rekindle that dead belief in love. I had washed my hands of finding 'the one', and at 44YO, I am feeling spontaneous as a kid. Reality would try to kill that spark, but too often, our relationships lack that blind abandonment and replace it with reason. The concept of free will is always guiding, and it's nice to feel 'freedom' again instead of adjusting my heart/life to fit the status quo. For that reason; I like it! I think it had the \\"love conqueors all\\" theme I need echoed at this time.

1455816361|5.0|Once more Jerry Robbins and the Colonial Radio Theater do another fabulous production of one of Ray Bradbury's works. The Martian Chronicles is quite possibly Ray Bradbury's finest fantasy writing and perhaps an allegorical tale of what happened to the Native Americans as this country was settled. Anyway this is the fourth production of CRT's in regards to Mr. Bradbury's works. The first three are Dandelion Wine, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and the wonderful Halloween Tree. If it really needs saying out loud I own and HIGHLY recommend these as well!     I had yet to read the Martian Chronicles so I bought a copy and read a few stories and then listened as this recording makes the words, characters and sounds of Mars literally leap off the page and into your ears! This is another triumph of CRT's and they only seem to get better! The beautiful part about them is when they adapt something they stick closely to the source material instead of trying to re-write it entirely. Jerry Robbins did the adapting and directing and it shows. You even get to hear his voice in several of the productions which is always a treat.     OK! That's enough reading reviews! Hit the add to cart button and I'll see you on Mars!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Christine wakes up at the beginning of this riveting thriller thinking she has just been through a one-night stand that she remembers nothing about. She has no recollection of the man she is sleeping next to -- or of the bed or the room she finds herself in. She staggers to the bathroom only to realize she has somehow aged 20 years without remembering that either. So starts this unusually accomplished debut novel.<br /><br />It becomes clear that Christine loses her memory each night when she goes to sleep. Every morning, she awakes unable to remember anything that has happened to her over the past 20 years. Her devoted husband Ben guides her through the day -- but as the book begins, Christine has a secret. Under the guidance of Dr.Nash, she has been keeping a journal in which she has written the words, \\"Don't Trust Ben.\\"<br /><br />As this book slowly unfolds, Christine begins to piece her past together -- and all is not as it seems. Who can she trust? Who does she love? Who loves her? What happened to her son Adam, her friend Claire, her career as a writer? What traumatic event caused her to lose her short-term memory?<br /><br />This is indeed a skillfully told story by a talented writer. My one quibble is that I guessed the central mystery about halfway through, thus robbing the second half of some of its suspense. I also thought the final climax did not do justice to the buildup. But all in all, a very satisfying read.

0670022411|5.0|So many of the reviews give excellent summaries of both character and plot, so I will refrain from doing so again. I am not a lover of history-laden fiction, but this book happened to link so many of my favorite things - the history of science, vampires, and witches. What self-respecting science-teacher-book-nerd can resist? Not I.    The author hooked me within the first few pages and I managed to read this leviathan in a single weekend (poor hubby was completely ignored, I'm sorry to say). I liked that the story's main protagonist is portrayed as both strong and weak, as I felt it was a more honest representation of women as whole. Far too many books portray us at opposite ends of the spectrum. We're either mindless damsels in distress or we're sword-wielding-bone-crunching-amazons that need no one.     I cannot thank the author enough for the additional research links she has provided. I can't wait to read them while I anxiously wait for her next book.

0307477479|2.0|When I first picked up A Visit from the Goon Squad, I didn't know much about it other than it had won the Pulitzer prize and that there was one chapter done completely in PowerPoint. Usually I don't take chances on buying books that I'm not completely sure I'll like, but I had an Amazon gift card and I needed some summer reading, so I decided to give it a shot. Besides, the blurb on Amazon said that it was pulsing with music on every page, and I'm a big sucker for music in books. What could possibly go wrong?<br /><br />The answer is, sadly, a lot. I guess, after the disaster that was Wolf Hall, I should have known better than to read a book just because it won a prize. A Visit from the Goon Squad was disappointing in so many ways. There were glimmers of potential and a few good moments scattered here and there, but they were lost in the overwhelming sense of mediocrity and self-conscious hipness that characterized the novel.<br /><br />First of all, the writing in this book was only mediocre, which is not something I expect from a Pulitzer winner. The tone of the writing was detached and almost neutral. While this could have worked for a book so focused on self-destruction and faded glory, Egan didn't quite pull it off. Instead of that detached style conveying the disillusionment and faded glory of the characters, it only serves to separate the reader from the action and keeps us from connecting with or feeling for the characters.<br /><br />The reader is also kept from connecting with the characters by the book's poor characterization and use of voice. Each chapter is told from the perspective of a different character at a different point in time. While fragmentation is one of my favorite literary devices when used properly, it is only effective when the characters' voices are distinct enough to allow the reader distinguish between them. Sadly, all of the character in this book sound the same, with the exception of the one chapter narrated by a punk teen and the two narrated by madmen (and even the two madmen were pretty darn similar). If you are going to make the focus of your book the varied and intersecting lives of a few generations of interconnected people, you should at least make those people and their lives different enough that the reader can tell them apart. I think Egan meant for there to be \\"Aha!\\" moments when you realized how people had influenced each other over time, but as it is I spent more time trying to remember who everyone was and how they were related than actually caring about them.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this book is that it is too self-consciously hip and modern. With every name-drop, use of slang or text speech, reference to drug use, or casual mention of recent events, I can feel the author trying very hard to be cool, relevant, and contemporary. I hate to say this, but if I can feel you trying to be cool, you aren't. The music, which the blurb on my book said would be central to the book, is incidental and mostly used as an excuse to name-drop and sound hip. It's like the author is screaming through the pages \\"Look at me. I'm so modern and cool. Maybe if I put in enough pop-culture references someone will find my work relevant.\\" Now, pop-culture references don't automatically make a book bad, nor does writing for a specific time and place. What this books misses, though, is everything else that makes a book worthwhile, like realistic characters, an interesting plot, or a discernible purpose.<br /><br />There were some instances where I felt like Egan could have really hit it out of the park and written a book that had meaningful commentary on modern life. The chapter in PowerPoint, for instance, could have been really great. Sadly, she didn't use the format to its full potential. I was expecting the PowerPoint chapter to be something corporate, a subtle and meaningful twist on a modern form of business communication, a mix of company presentation and personal reflection. Instead, the PowerPoint is simply the format in which a young girl keeps her diary, meaning that it's basically a more visual version of every other chapter. It was still one of my favorite chapters, but that had nothing to do with the format. When you add something interesting and revolutionary like that, it should be because it is in some way necessary, not just because you want to show off. Like so many of the other modern things in this book, this just gave me the impression that Egan was writing to impress. She did a great job of showing off her formal skills, but inside that formal structure the book was hollow.<br /><br /> For a story about aging punks, the march of time, and the inevitability of death, A Visit from the Goon Squad lacks any real profound moments. The biggest realization is that everyone eventually gets old and dies, but that realization is generalized and cliched, rather than poignant or meaningful. Though it is concerned with being relevant and modern, A Visit from the Goon Squad fails to have anything truly new to say, and is therefore completely forgettable.<br /><br />Rating: 2 stars<br />Mediocre writing, lack of characterization, no discernible meaning, self-conscious, labored, forgettable.rl keeps her diary, meaning that it's basically a more visual version of every other chapter.

It's just a matter of time before it hits the airwaves of classic rock stations. It may already be on. That's not a bad thing. Except that the rest of their albums fall short. But the bar was set too high by this masterpiece. If you make it past the first song on this album and find it to your liking, I can guarantee you'll love the rest.

It's unfair to compare this with anything else.
0062060554|3.0|(This review will contain MILD spoilers.)<br /><br />Before I go to Sleep is a surprisingly old fashioned gothic, the kind where the heroine marries in haste and frets at leisure. The novelty here is that the narrator's own inability to form new long-term memories keeps her in a constant state of doubt. Can she trust her husband? Her doctor? Her best friend? It's more soapy than suspenseful, although I'm sure it will hit the sweet spot for many readers who miss Mary Stewart, or who wish Mary Higgins Clark was smarter.<br /><br />That said, I admired Watson's ability to vary his lead character's personality from day to day while maintaining a sense of the core \\"self\\" that the reader can relate to. As Christine wakes each day with no memory of who she is or how she ended up in bed with a person who seems to be a stranger, she doesn't react the same way every time. Some days she seems more suspicious, other days more sad, or more accepting. That made sense to me.<br /><br />But there are problems. The first is that every character needs to act in exactly the way that they do to maintain the mystery of the situation. This seems particularly improbable in the case of the doctor, for a number of reasons too spoiler-y to get into here. I read a review on this site that said Christine's family and friends are all terrible people - they're not terrible so much as unobservant, because the plot requires them to be unobservant.<br /><br />My main criticism of the novel, though, lies with the ending. (mild spoilers ahead!) \\"Oh my god!\\" someone says. \\"I can't believe _________!!!\\" \\"I know,\\" Christine replies. \\"Call me tomorrow and we'll talk about it some more.\\" Not, \\"Come rescue me!\\" Not, \\"Call the police!!\\" This completely illogical delay allows the villian to go crazy and get with the violence. Like, super, super, nobody-would-actually-do-that crazy. Ridiculously crazy.<br /><br />That killed the suspense for me. It was too over the top.<br /><br />(Finally, I'd like to address two facts that bother other reviews, but that are dealt with in the narrative (again, there will be mild spoilers): The diary that we read isn't the actual diary, but a recreation of it made after the fact. So she had all the time in the world to write it and get as literary as she wanted (she is a novelist). Also, the exact situation that Christine is in at the beginning of the novel has only existed for four months. That relatively short time span actually makes many things more credible, I think.)that are dealt with in the narrative (again, there will be mild spoilers): The diary that we read isn't the actual diary, but a recreation of it made after the fact.

It's pretty roomy and the zippered compartment is great if I just want to throw in my ID and a few dollars.

Gaga has been able to mold past works and genres into a modernized pop masterpiece in the way Madonna did back in her peak. This album will be remembered not only for it's unique presence in our current mainstream scene but for the amazing visuals shes presented with the album publicly. From the alien-esque Marilyn Manson inspired prosthetics from her Born This Way music video to the Biblical imagery of her Youtube hit Judas. I'm sure the cherry on top will happen when her worldwide tour kicks off in support of this album. This album is a melting pot of new-wave, hair-metal, club beats, dance-pop, and rock'n'roll. Only GaGa could take this big of a risk this early in her career in this day and age. GaGa is on top of her game in a way no one thought she could be in the beginning. She's come a long way from the faux-plastic pop of The Fame. She's furthering her legacy.<br /><br />5 STARS
B0055B0MIO|5.0|I got this album, because I am a long time fan of Trivium; and I own three of their first four albums (all except for Ember to Inferno).  Of the three albums I had from them, I enjoyed Ascendancy and Shogun equally.  The Crusade wasn't too bad, it just didn't blow me away.  When this album was announced, I was excited and I pre-ordered to guarantee a copy.  This album is amazing, from the beginning song \\"Capsizing the Sea\\" (which is an instrumental) to the finale \\"Slave New World.\\"  This is one of their most consistent albums to date, and with 18 songs; it's their most fulfilling.  No one should come away with disappointment or feel like they didn't get their money's worth, it would pretty much be impossible.  I also need to point out that I listened to the album three times through and I tried to pick out a favorite song for this review, and I couldn't.  The album was far too consistent to choose, and each song that came on had competition with the previous and the next songs.  For that reason I will list a few of my most memorable songs.  Great album, I recommend to fans of metal, Trivium, and good music in general!  5/5    Memorable Songs: 'In Waves', 'Watch the World Burn', 'Black', 'A Skyline's Severance', and 'Built to Fall' :)
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee poured her heart out on what was a horrifying experience. The fact that she came out of it strong and loving and not bitter is a wonder. God surely was with her all the time holding her hand.
0553801473|3.0|Huge fan but unfortunately must add my voice to the many disappointed readers who eagerly awaited DWD.<br /><br />The book starts strong with familiar characters, cliff hanger chapters, witty Tyrion dialogue and then simultaneously the plot comes to a slogging halt as literally one and ninety-nine new characters are flung at us from every corner of the freakin map....I love a rich environment but come on....off with a few heads.....some of these guys gotta go......I almost hate to say it but it is oddly like the WOT series which I simply got to a place where I couldn't continue.....<br /><br />So when does the next Abercrombie book come out?  Looking forward to seeing in the Bloody Nine actually survived that plunge. :)
B004EPYZSK|3.0|With a silly title like Cowboys and Aliens, I did not set my expectations too high, but I was hoping for a slightly better movies than it was since it boasted an All Star cast. I felt like they tried a little too hard in the beginning to convince the audience that Craig as a tough guy. He pulled it off, but something about it just felt forced to me. I also think the alien (human?) hunting could have been better with more surprise scenes that make you jump out of your chair. Also, a movie like this should have been rated R to really give it the rawness it needed.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is one of the best human/dog friendship movies ever made. Being a true story makes it even more incredible. I've seen it 3 times and will watch it more, I'm sure, many times. You'll never forget the story....Never.
B0054QD4L2|3.0|I'm not going to actually review this kdrama as I've only watched four episodes so far. What I'm going to do is warn people ahead of time who want to purchase this dvd. So far, this series is a 4 star drama. However, bad grammar, spelling, late and super fast subtitles will keep some people from fully enjoying the series. Several times already I've had to rewind and do a step forward just to read the subtitles. They appear and disappear instantly. I've been watching foreign movies and dramas with English subs for probably close to 25 years now so reading subs don't bother me. It's a habit that I even put on subs for American movies as I'm so used to it. However, these subs come on slightly late sometimes and sometimes too fast. I also believe that it's not all subbed as it seems to me they missed portions of the dialog. Not a bad drama so far but I've only seen the first four episodes. If you can deal with the subtitle issues then this might be worth it. I like it so far. Oh, another thing, since Tai Seng put four episodes a disc, picture quality isn't as good as the dramas released by YA Entertainment. Also of note is all four discs are placed in a single dvd case on top of one another, kind of like on a spool.
B002SAS26E|5.0|Nicely illustrated cards and pieces. Good durability for cards. Fantastic trading mechanism. Trade with the board and try and gain the most points: do you take the camels for a future trade also risking giving your opponent some great trades...do you sell early to gain higher points for your goods...do you try and get 5 cards to sell at once for a big bonus...do you make sure you have more camels than your opponent?    The game has some luck to the cards that are flipped, but there is strategy in what actions you choose and when, as well as watching your opponents decisions and acting accordingly. Best 2 out of 3 rounds, although you can make the game even shorter if you want to just play one round. A great two player game. I would highly recommend this game.    Games that you would enjoy if you enjoy this one...or...if you enjoy these games, you would enjoy Jaipur:  Coloretto  Lost Cities  Bohnanza
1451629184|5.0|When the story broke that after 18 yrs Jaycee Dugard had be discovered alive, we all wanted to know what had happened to her. Thankfully, the press left her alone to start the healing process. I am not sure words can actually describe my opinion of this book. I am sure I didn't expect to have such an open recalculation of her story. Jaycee is probably the strongest woman I have ever heard of. My heart goes out to her and her family. I do hope that one day you will find peace in your recovery.
B004SRNH10|5.0|All you iSheep flash haters out there quit complaining about it burning battery life.   Update your 1.0 install to the latest version that uses hardware acceleration, and battery life issues go away. Or you can sit around and complain about it (for another 10 years) which is what you are the best at apparently.  And remember if its not running it can&apos;t use battery.  AIR is an awesome solution for a lifelong problem, and it is bringing many new games and apps to the market in MUCH less time.  Go check out the top 20 apps in the big 3 apps stores (Apple, Google and Amazon) now and then and see how many are flash based.  Quite often you&apos;ll find many.  Smart programmers use the best tool for the task, and quite often it&apos;s flash\/air and NOT native because they can write the app ONCE and have it run across multiple devices.  That&apos;s why you see apps on the iPhony that don&apos;t match the apps on the Android, because they had to write them twice with different languages, so they have to debug them twice, and charge more because it took them twice as long to write.  If you are not using Flash\/Air you are leaving money on the table.  Flash is here to stay, get used to it.  GO ADOBE!
B0055SWM08|4.0|A fun puzzle game, so far not too hard but not boring either.  I find it really laxing to play.
B004L49K20|1.0|I'm very dissapointed in this new cd. Doesn't sound anything like the old Duran Duran. I'm a big fan of the band and feel they should of quit while they were ahead and preserve their legacy like The Beatles did. This album just doesn't have it.The only good song is \\"Mediterrania\\". Another thing is the cover and all the inside pictures look as if they were snapped while on LSD. Their first three albums were the best.
1461190460|2.0|This is a copy of the original. Yet, it has the same price. It's not colored which was annoying because it has many pictures.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I loved this movie for its story, its color, vibrancy, emotion and touch. On first view I will admit that the voices seemed peculiar, but not so different from the stage production. On subsequent viewings the story comes out deep, rich and provocative. It is a wonderful adaptation and filled with rich imagery expected from film while retaining the essence of its stage production origins.<br /><br />This is a tragedy of heart. Circumstance has brought these players together. Let's call it fate and all are the supporting cast to this masquerade, but central is the love triangle which will always be shared from behind every shadow by Roul, the Phantom, with Christine in the middle, forever touch by the Phantoms gift of music. The phantom, despite his raging anger, jealous sensitivities, self-esteem issues, deceptions and violent outburst (sometimes resulting in murder), is in the end a sympathetic character. I am sure many of us can sympathize with loving someone more than they love us. Some of us have even played our own simple games of deception (or denial) in order to hold onto any thread of connections alive, only in the end being futile and painful when the object of our affections finds their one true love. The Phantom plays this childish game, being loved (and feared) for what he can do for/to others, he is fooled into believing that love is what he can control and not what is felt, albeit feeling it all the while.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story, although filled with adult themes which may be even too emotionally charge and morally contradicting for most children and teens. Be prepared to cry yourself.<br /><br />How can you love, fear, hate, admire, respect and pity someone all at the same time is the dilemma of Christine, the focus of the Phantom's twisted ambitions and his one true love? The two share many years together, although never meeting, while the phantom pretends to be the spirit of Christine's fathers long since passed away. And, so, these two are forever entwined. And it is this journey which forever binds Christine and the Phantom in both love or tragedy.<br /><br />I was moved to tears as the ending theme song reminds us of the eternal solitude the Phantom must bare, having tasted love for all of a brief moment while his hidden unrequited perpetual yearning for one woman's love continues beyond his failed attempts to own her. And it is this fatal love which haunts all (Roul, Christine & Phantom) to their graves long after the opera house was burned and the object of their love, Christine, has died and the suitors, all the while aware of each other and that she loved them both although only one was fortunate enough to enjoy the fulfillment of her devotions. A bitter sweet triangle reminiscent of Serrano De Bergerac.<br /><br />The story is filled with emotion and it is the story which makes the movie so rich and fulfilling. Christine and Roul were separated by a family tragedy, but have never lost the sweetness of their young love. The Phantom, abandoned by his mother and enslaved and brutalized by a gypsy circus an mockingly displayed as `the Devil's Child' gains freedom by murdering his abusive capture and foreshadowing his \\"lust for blood\\". He is saved by a patron to his side show, a young ballet student (Madame Gyri) who  feels sympathy for his treatment and hastily hides him away at the opera house. It is there he develops into a man. And it is certain that the exaggerations of the operatic stage productions (themes being typically murder, betrayal, etc.) and the quirky lifestyles of the stage performers are likely relevant to why the Phantom is so emotionally charged and dramatic in nature.<br /><br />Equaling fulfilling is the excellent editing as the moving flows along, never boring, always engaging, foreshadowing and directing the audience just enough to add meaning to future events, but in the end allowing enough mystery to set the imagination free to conclude the story as one personally desires. The costuming is just as outrageous as you would expect from the real world fantasy of stage productions. The movie adaptation adds continuity, special and chronological which can only be alluded to in the stage production which adds greatly to understanding the story and plot. Flashbacks are also used to provide both chronological and emotional clarity to the script and add a rich depth to the performance and emotional story line by eliciting form the audience some self-reflection as to both the control and uncontrolled fateful courses of their lives.<br /><br />And thus the story begins. Each member of our love triangle has grown to adulthood, full of life and hope yet Christine and the Phantom are haunted by their own tragedies. They are all about to be reborn through a trial of fire centered around the Phantoms misguided beliefs that he must deceive wantonly to be accepted and that control will bring him love ...and ironically, accomplish all this from among the shadows, afraid of revealing his deforming birth defect. The Phantom's existence becomes more production than reality. Perhaps this is why the Phantom is willing to destroy the essence of his soul ...his music and the opera house which is the stage for his life's purpose. And all this rage which has \\"turn into madness\\" is thus magnified by his budding manhood's violent jealousy, further `distorting' his soul and driving away his love.from the real world fantasy of stage productions.

B003VANOFY|5.0|There are so many good features built into this headset, I am not sure where to begin. 3D surround sound, great battery life, noise cancelling, and super sound!
B0049IHX2C|4.0|Good sequel to first one.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I have not stopped talking about the last 2 Potter films.  I LOVE how closely they track the book which is always my chief complaint when a book goes to Hollywood.  What's not to love about the Potter films, they're great and will be around for years to come.
B0034JKZ86|4.0|This DVD is pretty cute but the shadow men are a little scary to our 3 year old. Nevertheless, she loves watching it while wearing her princess dress.
B000GSA59M|5.0|I can not say enough about this mixer, it is amazing, the USB function on it is amazing, It has stereo in and out via USB. Keep in mind, you wont get all 8 channels though usb, you will get left and right channels, which for me is more than perfect. The British style EQ's are very nice. All of the nobs are very sturdy. The mixer itself is very light. Over all would recommend this to everyone.  For your reference, i am a producer, and i do recordings of various artists across several genres.
031250926X|5.0|This has been one of my daughter's favorite books from very early on.  At around 6 months old she was only moderately interested in books, but she would sit in my lap for repeated readings of this one.  I think the slide and find windows made a huge difference.  Now that she's 16 months old it is still one of her favorites, especially since she can slide the windows by herself now.  My only criticism is that the windows do stick a bit at first, but with repeated readings they get easier and easier to slide back and forth.
B000002IG4|5.0|Love Phil - and I got this in London on a cassette in 1982. so found it on CD format to keep them memories, and sinmce the old tape cassette wore out, I just had to have this.  One of his best!
B001CVMD4M|5.0|This dvd is the best dvd out there four the spice girls. i love it xoxoxoxoxox. if your a fan you  need to get this dvd  you wont be sorry . its great
1451629184|3.0|Some would say that it was repeatitive, unpolished, with spelling errors; however my heart went out to her and her family. I was so angry at those monsters.  I hope they spend their future is prison with no reprieve.  Please read this book and educate your children not to be the perfect victim.  Hold your head up,and know your surroundings. SCREAM YELL fIGHT!!!!!
B000N3ST8O|5.0|I love all her cd's. I just purchase them all because i KNOW THEY WILL BE great. have been a fan for 20 years. Can never go wrong buying Stevie.
0312330871|5.0|Mystery at its very finest.  Taut, compelling, absorbing.  Ten people are brought to an island under rather odd circumstances.  They're welcomed in the absence of owner \\"U. K. Owen\\" and after their shock at the playing of an audio recording accusing each of them of murder, one of them dies.  Then another.  Then another.  The remaining survivors do their best to defend themselves and identify the person killing them, addressing the issue of whether it's one of them or someone hidden on the island.  The rapid-fire beginning introduction of characters is supplemented well by their words and actions on the island, so they become clear.  The clues are there, but this reader found them subtle enough to miss sometimes, and only obvious in the retrospect of the ending revelations.  It's different than the modern mysteries I enjoy, but is simply sparkling.  Yes, a bit unnerving, but amazingly well constructed and a complete pleasure to read.  I will definitely be looking for more.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This movie is one of the best films I have ever seen.  I could watch it over and over again.  Well done in every way and I thoroughly enoyed every minute of it!!!  Don't miss it.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|This is a fantastic movie.  The scenes of Rio De Janeiro are really fantastic and actually very realistic - there are parts of Rio that are just unbelievably beautiful.  The story is fun and the music is also terrific.  However, I was really hopeful that there would be a language soundtrack in Portuguese.  Is that too much to ask for? That a movie that takes place in Rio and that actually has some dialogue in Portuguese, would have a Portuguese soundtrack?  Thank you, ignorant, out of touch movie studio executive that made that call.
B00247RVGS|2.0|I was quite disappointed in this movie.  I had heard and read so much about it that I really wanted to see it.  Now that I have I don't see what all the raves are about, including all the academy awards and all!  It makes it's point about child abuse and trafficking, but that is about all I can say about it.  In addition it is hard to watch all the brutality, etc.  I can't really recommend it, sorry.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|very good application but needs to keep up with android market updates though....\ncome on amazon let&apos;s get those updates going!!
B004VSTP4Y|2.0|I was expecting a lot more from the ending of this trilogy. It felt like the author just got tired of writing and started to pen some BS to fill pages. The book moved along slowly and then the end came and went in too few pages. The ending left too much to the imagination. Wish I had saved my money on this one.
B003Y5H53S|4.0|Movie works great, it delivered to my house in a fashionable timely matter.   I love the movie. Really cute. My kids love the movie most importantly .  Thanks amazon.

1601251831|4.0|The Bestiary I is a necessity for any game designer using the Pathfinder ruleset.  It brings back a lot of the good ol' monsters from Wizards of the Coast's 3.5 DnD System (Demons, Devil, Tarrasque...gnomes...) while cutting out a lot of the 'filler' creatures people rarely found entertaining.<br /><br />My only recommendation beyond this product is to entertain the thought of purchasing the Bestiary II.  While this product is great, due to the graphics and descriptors (each and every single creature has an entire page dedicated solely to it), that also comes with the drawback of there being fewer creatures to pull from.  Combined with the Bestiary II, you have a veritable army of monsters with complete descriptors in a well balanced system to entertain and challenge players for years!<br /><br />My hats are off to Paizo and the Pathfinder products - I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a new D20 system to play.
3836503050|3.0|I don't like the layout of this book. I prefer books with a print per page but this one seems designed so that you couldn't possibly take anything out and frame it. I should have researched more before I purchased it. Great art but I really wanted more of a coffee table book with prints large enough to really take in all of the details. Oh well.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Took less than 30 seconds for this to work! Great app for moving stuff between phone and your home computer
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|almost missed out on this one!! wish I had found it sooner and most definitely would have paid for it!!
B002ZG9800|1.0|You would think two great actors would equal at least a half decent film guess what your wrong, this film was absolute rubbish, A supposed true story of a once straight cop, going gay - it wasnt funny, it was pathetic I turned it off half way through - if watching to guys have sex this is your thing then go for it, as for a film not funny, not anything positive just rubbish.
B005ERYEGU|5.0|I found this book easy to overview, with clear diagrams and headers, so I could dig into the sections that immediately impacted my client and their reps.  I've already recommended it to one of them.  It's also easy to understand - though implementing the changes are a major shift if you currently use 'coast to coast' sales people.  The structure of the Predictable Revenue system - splitting up the sales process into different sales roles - permits a company to make adjustments and build a sustainable system because it leverages skills and sales executives will quit prospecting when there are deals to work.  If you're a fan of Solution Selling, you will love this book and this system - at least I did.   My feeling is that the Predictable Revenue system has the potential to be as successful as the Solution Selling system and I expect to see it around for years to come.   The email first technique is new to me; he's sold on email first, call second while some people I know call first.  Since the techniques can be tested and tweaked over time it's low risk to try it - and both fit into their model.   Their system doesn't eliminate marketing to create inbound - recognizing it as a needed component.   Most importantly, it protects the times of the sales reps and lets them focus on selling not prospecting.  As with any sales book there are a few items that I am not sure about but I do like the way they give frequently give guidelines not templates.
0553573403|5.0|This whole set of books are fantastic. Any SciFi fantasy reader will love them. I have been reading fantasy since I have 16 and read Tolkien now I'm 62. I can remember when the book stores and libraries didn't even have sections for science fiction/fantasy. Start reading them you won't be able to stop. Thank you George Martin for some really good reading.
B0033AI4CK|5.0|The late Sidney Lumet had a shining period during the '70s and early '80s with \\"Serpico\\", \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\", \\"Prince Of the City\\", \\"The Anderson Tapes\\", \\"Long Days Journey Into Night\\", and \\"Murder On the Orient Express\\".  But this outrageous dark black comedy will perhaps last the test of time because everyone in the cast from William Holden to Robert Duvall are at the top of their form.  And one must never forget Peter Finch's Oscar winning performance as Howard Beale, the \\"Mad Prophet of the airwaves\\". Ironically many of his rantings have now come true and are especially relevant today in our recession era times.
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|STWOF...STWOF... The Black Veil Brides got me again :) All the way from New religeon to Youth and Whiskey (smoke and mirrors on itunes bonus) this album completely dominated. i personally believe BVB completely outdid themselves with Fallen Angels and Saviour. Saviour has become my all time favorite song. Andys voice got a little more raspy :) i love it XD! love the backround vox!! Ashley?? the guitarwork is much like what synyster and zakky would do in avenged sevenfold. GET THIS ALBUM. it will change you forever. POSITIVELY. XD
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|Wow! Talk about five star acting, and the music?  Incredible!  The most amazing aspect is that there is no \\"fowl\\" language, no innuendos, and children, as well as adults seem to love this movie!  Definitely one of a kind show... and who would have thought Will.i.am, Jamie Foxx, Jesse Eisenberg, Anne Hathaway, and Leslie Mann would ever be in a movie together?  Sort of like mixing taffy, jalapenos, and chicken nuggets to come up with some fantastic recipe that actually works!<br /><br />Colorful and never boring... if you haven't seen it yet, you're simply depriving yourself!
B002ZG993Q|4.0|Fantastic movie, where every frame is a beautiful photograph. Much better than the book.  A fresh take on spy thriller hit man genre.
B005DD7H50|4.0|Whats makes this movie so goos is that there is a good pace to it. Bigger yet, is that the movie really addresses every wild imaginative thing one would think of to do with the powers Edward gains. Really enjoyed the movie!!! Worth watching.
B0032UYFA6|4.0|Excellent drama, tension and comedy. If you enjoyed quality shows  like The Sopranos, Mad Men, Eastbound & Down and The Office (US version) you might enjoy this.
B0055FR5PS|5.0|I have been hoping for a long time Hollywood would get their patriotism back and make great feel good movie about our soliders and the USA. This is it!!! The movie is not about the viewer getting to know the character thoroughly. It is about the courage the marines have when trouble rises. Lots of action!
B004OZOTSQ|4.0|I'm giving this 4 stars as when I contacted the developer he was quick to respond...though he didn't have any idea how to fix my problem.  When I try to get in I get an \\"Oops, cannot connect to site....\\".  My router is blocking this somehow but I have no idea how to fix it...and since the wireless network was set up by my roommate I cannot make any changes to it.<br /><br />Looks like this is a good app for those that can get it to work.  I posted this issue in the Droid X forum and found another guy with the same exact problem.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I've watched this series since day one on t.v.. Exciting, riveting and funny.  I have purchased the first three seasons and watching g the fourth on t.v. now.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|It's 164 minutes with lots of extras!!!  Worth 6 stars<br /><br />From Amazon UK:<br />Rush s Time Machine shows in 2010 / 11 were one of the most anticipated tours ever.

The shows also featured favourite tracks from across their lengthy career and two new songs expected to feature on their next studio album. As ever the concerts were a visual feast and sounded great with the band playing at the top of their form. Reviews for the tour have been amazing from both fans and critics alike and this Blu-ray release is guaranteed to appeal to Rush fans everywhere.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A thousand splendid suns, is a tale regarding the figure of two very different female but unified by the violence against the women, their names are Mariam and Laila.<br /><br />Mariam is the heroine of this novel, she is 15 years old her ethnicity is Tajik like Laila, she was born in the 1978, beautiful and well educated and the contrast of this novel is Rasheed a vile man.<br /><br />Nana, the mother of Mariam is always embittered wedlock and think that the cause of her frustration is her daughter, because she was forced to marry Jalil (Mariam's father)<br /><br />Oftentimes reading and rereading this novel I thought that between their culture and ours there is not a substantial difference, in the sense that even in the western society,  past and modern the women were and are forced to marry a wealthy man, in other words, it seems Lizzy of  Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />My favourite characters are Mariam and her father Jalil (he is the antithesis of our prejudices) mainly because, being poor she has not incremented hate against the rich people, but she has donated something of invaluable.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Italo
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I ordered this right after I got my iPad 1 for Christmas. I was recommending the product to a friend who's buying an iPad and looked at all the recent negative reviews and decided to test the adapters myself. I've just received the latest update for my iPad (4.3.5) and these adapters work perfectly. I tested the SD card reader and photos imported exactly as requested; I used the USB adapter for a CompactFlash card and for a Memory Stick Pro Duo. All worked flawlessly.     You can get simple editing apps from the App Store, so I have absolutely no complaints about these little adapters and highly recommend them.

0441009425|4.0|Revelation Space is ambitious. My sense is that Alastair Reynolds tried to write an epic novel, but \\"epic\\" means something more than \\"long.\\" At bottom, Revelation Space is an action-adventure story -- a good one, but not much more than that. Maybe that's all Reynolds intended, but given the novel's heft, I suspect he wanted to combine a science fiction adventure with a novel of grand ideas. If so, his success was only partial.<br /><br />This isn't a novel that lends itself to a brief summary. Suffice it to say that Sylveste believes himself to be the only person who has returned alive and sane from a journey into Revelation Space, home of the Shrouders. Sylveste has since made his life on Resurgam, where a series of problems have interfered with his study of the alien race that once inhabited the planet: Sylveste's enemies want to gain control of his father (Calvin), who no longer exists in corporeal form; political unrest leads to his kidnapping; the Ultras (humans who have adapted to a life spent in interplanetary travel) want to snatch Sylveste and Calvin from Resurgam in the hope that they can restore the health of their ship's frozen captain, the victim of a virus that is slowly infecting the entire ship. An assassin named Khouri contrives to join the crew of the Ultra ship after being recruited by the Mademoiselle to kill Sylveste. Khouri doesn't know whether to believe that Sylveste is the threat to humankind that the Mademoiselle makes him out to be, and in any event she has problems of her own: the Mademoiselle and something called Sun Stealer are waging a war to control her. The story goes on from there ... and on ... and on ....<br /><br />My most significant complaint about Revelation Space is that Reynolds overloads the reader with redundant and irrelevant information, making this lengthy novel longer than it needs to be. Revelation Space suffers from an excess of exposition: paragraph after mind numbing paragraph of background detail that the reader doesn't need to know.<br /><br />As for grand ideas: the concept of revelation space implies the occurrence of revelations. Certainly the few humans who enter the Shroud and manage to return are changed by the experience, but those changes seem little different from standard science fiction fare. The notion of Pattern Jugglers seeded in the oceans of various worlds and the unique function they serve is intriguing, but it is also the closest Reynolds comes to a grand idea. The rest of the novel we've seen before: weaponized battle suits; an interstellar ship that more or less takes on a life of its own; a lost alien civilization that tries to escape its fate, leaving behind markers which guide intrepid humans to trouble. The cutely named entity known as the Sun Stealer comes across as a familiar quasi-cybernetic threat, while the virus that is transforming the Ultra captain into something nonhuman is equally recognizable.<br /><br />Arguably, there's an epic story buried in the background. We're told about the Dawn War that ended a billion years ago; its aftermath explains why there is so little alien life in the galaxy as Reynolds imagines it. Yet that episode of galactic history is told in several paragraphs that inform the surrounding story. The story of the Dawn War might have been more intriguing than the one Reynolds told.<br /><br />In the end, all the words add up to not much that's new or eventful, leaving a clever but overly long tale of science fiction adventure. The ending smartly ties together the novel's larger concepts, but those concepts are diminished by the unremarkable story that surrounds them. Revelation Space is good for what it is: an entertaining, but far from ground-breaking, story of people on a quest to understand their part in the universe. For that reason, I recommend it to science fiction fans, but I don't think it deserves the full measure of praise that has been heaped upon it.As for grand ideas: the concept of revelation space implies the occurrence of revelations.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is the best keyboard I have ever used on any platform. The predictor is good from the start and gets better with time. The ability to have more than one language at once is awesome. I absolutely recommend this product.
0307593525|5.0|I am so pleased with this cookbook. It is truly a teaching cookbook! Wonderful descriptions and instructions. I actually feel that I need to read and study it before trying some of the recipies. I am so relieved to have this instruction so that I know exactly what they mean every step of the way. I'm looking forward to \\"Mastering\\" this book.
0441009425|5.0|I've been a sucker for these kinds of novels ever since I read Arthur C. Clarke's 2001, so it's my own fault that I've been lured in by yet another one.  Mysterious artifacts produced by long-dead, super-advanced civilizations and shocking revelations about the history of the universe and intelligent life itself...haven't we been here before?  Yes, although Clarke, Benford, Hamilton, and others have done it much better and more convincingly.  Reynolds does deliver the goods, but what's missing is the powerful sense of awe and wonder that characterize these types of novels at their best.  He does try, but it comes off somewhat clinical, possibly because it's difficult to like or want to identify with any of the characters.  The protagonist is a monomaniacal jerk (although there are reasons for that, which relate to the plot!), and the starship crew is nothing more than a gang of cold-blooded pirates.  Liquid helium cold, that is.  The protagonist's wife claims he loves her, although she can't seem to convince the other characters, let alone the reader, of the fact.  The universe of Revelation Space is well-developed, however, and the pacing of the story sent me racing through the last third of the book, even if the final revelations fell somewhat flat.  It was a great concept flawed in the execution.  I will read the subsequent novels to see if there's an emotional payoff from this setup...I hope to see Reynolds' work improve.    (EDIT) I've since re-read this book a couple times and listened to the excellent audio adaptation read by John Lee, and revised my opinion of this book. The purpose of the book is not to inspire awe and wonder, but rather to impress upon you the vastness and coldness of the universe, and the precarious position of life within the universe. The kilometers-long Nostalgia for Infinity, with its crew of less than ten, is the haunted ship to end all haunted ships. It serves as a microcosm of that vast, frightening universe filled with inscrutable, pitiless entities with lifespans bounded by deep time. This is a rare example of a book that improves with repeated readings, as I abandoned my expectations of what it should be and opened myself to what it really is. It may not give you that warm feeling of being part of something huge the way Clarke's work does, but it will give the you the chills when you realize how mind-shatteringly huge the universe is, and how tiny you are.
1451629184|4.0|Simple,straight forward, and such a great example of someone whose maturity process was interrupted by unimaginable events. It's amazing how adaptable the human mind can be. It is a story worth your time to listen and/or read.     Jaycee's voice is so youthful and strong - both written and oral. I came away with a better understanding of what 'strength of character' and 'grace under pressure' mean. One comes away from this story strangely humbled, hopeful and determined to renew one's efforts in one's own life.     Jaycee, thank you for your efforts to climb the mountains of your life, and I hope with all of my heart that you are able to enjoy every one of the spectacular views that new perspective can provide. You're girls are so lucky to have you as a mother, and, as a mother myself, I share your mother's joy at the return of her precious child.     The book was well worth your time and effort and will definitely inspire others to survive and/or take action during times of trial - just as you wish. I wish you every happiness that life can provide for you and your family.

B000JBWWRY|5.0|I love Walt Disney's Peter Pan. I have loved it since I was a child, and I still watch it to this day. It is a family classic that teaches us not to grow up too quickly and reminds us all of the joys of childhood. However, caution should be exercised when allowing children to watch this movie. Though Peter Pan seems innocent enough at first glance, it contains sexist and patriarchal ideologies which can be damaging to children. In her textbook Critical Theory Today,--which is used in college classrooms across the nation--Lois Tyson writes: \\"Patriarchy is thus, by definition, sexist, which means it promotes the belief that women are innately inferior to men.\\"     Do we really want our children--or anyone--to adopt this belief?     When the animated film came out in 1953 (and especially when the book was published in the early 1900's) these patriarchal views of traditional gender roles were the norm. Females were supposed to be submissive to males. If they were not, they were outcaste and/or reprimanded. Males were supposed to be the providers and protectors, and if they were unable to fulfill these roles they were considered failures.  A lot has changed since then. We have gained new insight and understanding of gender roles. No girl should grow up believing that their only options in life are either that of \\"wife\\" and \\"mother\\" or \\"b****\\"and \\"wh*re,\\" and that if they violate a patriarchal norm--such as expressing their opinions or refusing to submit to a male--they are the latter. No boy should grow up believing that if he does not accept a risky challenge he is a failure, or if he displays feelings such as love, pain, or fear he is a \\"coward\\" or a \\"sissy.\\"     Peter Pan leads children to adhere to these oppressive gender roles through the actions and results of its characters: Peter Pan always gives the orders and expects them to be obeyed. Princess Tiger Lily and Tinkerbelle have no voice in any matter--figuratively and literally--they never speak! Tinkerbelle represents Peter Pan's significant other: voiceless and submissive. When she attempts to express her concern over Peter Pan bringing home another girl (Wendy) he promptly banishes her.     Peter Pan is the provider and the protector. He never backs down from a challenge, especially if his reputation is at risk (such as when Captain Hook lures him into a battle by calling him a coward). Peter Pan never shows fear and he never fails. He is portrayed as the hero. Captain Hook does show fear, for instance whenever the crocodile is present. He loses all of his battles with Peter Pan, and is then called a \\"codfish\\" because he is weak and helpless. Captain hook is portrayed as the antagonist, or the \\"bad guy.\\" The resulting implication for males is that: strength, power and success at all endeavors = hero; Displays of emotion and unsuccessful attempts = failure and disappointment in all aspects of life.     I do not mean to chase anyone off from this movie, but rather to provide a warning to viewers. Even if one does not know what feminist criticism is, or the meanings of \\"sexist\\" and \\"patriarchal,\\" it is still very possible to internalize the concepts subliminally, especially through appealing media, which Peter Pan certainly is. So by all means, watch this movie, but watch it with your and be prepared to follow up with a discussion.
B0030U1TLQ|5.0|The Cure - Disintegration (original release date - 1989)<br /><br />Disk 1:<br /><br />Most fans consider DISINTEGRATION to be the Cure's masterpiece and you probably already know that, so this review will focus on the extras you get with this deluxe edition. As with all the other deluxe Cure albums released thus far, it's a very fine set with a cardboard sheath and a wonderful booklet filled with rare photos and excellent liner notes including information about the album less commonly known, even to Cure fans. To my ears, the original album on disk one sounds fantastic and automatically earns this release a five-star rating.<br /><br />Disk 2: Rarities<br /><br />Most of these tracks are clearly inferior to the final masters. Presented here in various stages of development, they will only appeal to the hardest of die-hard fans. But there's a few gems amid these uncut stones worth noting:<br /><br />3. \\"Fascination Street\\" (Robert Smith home demo) - Like the others, this is basically a short song sketch, far removed from the final master, but it does have some interesting guitar sounds, a cool drum program and an intriguing arrangement.  ***1/2<br /><br />6. \\"Noheart\\" (band rehearsal) - This previously unreleased track is typical eerie, downbeat Cure. It's got some clanging haunted house guitar and great drum work from Boris Williams. It definitely could've been transformed into a worthwhile Cure song, but alas, it remains a mere two-and-a-half minute song sketch. ***1/2<br /><br />7. \\"Esten\\" (band demo) - Moody yet driving and upbeat, this demo sounds good but the music itself isn't particularly remarkable. It has a definitive Cure sound and there's some good guitar playing in there, but I can see why it was abandoned. ***<br /><br />18. \\"Out of Mind\\" (Studio Rough) - has a different feel and a slightly different arrangement with a bolder bass line and chugging guitar chords. Robert's vocals are more relaxed and spacey than the final version. This track is way cool and worth hearing. ****1/4<br /><br />19. \\"Delirious Night\\" (Rough Mix) - sounds fantastic and wondrous with briskly strummed acoustic guitars, insistent, poly-rhythmic drums, dreamy synths and a murky vocal from Smith. The wind chimes heard at the beginning and end of this song were used for \\"Plainsong\\" so of course they wouldn't have been included here if the track had made the album. Not really good or complete enough to be worthy of a place on DISINTEGRATION, but it's a beautiful listen nonetheless. ****1/2<br /><br />20. \\"Pirate Ships\\" (Robert Smith solo) - this fascinating track is a cover of a Judy Collins song, originally intended for inclusion on the RUBAIYAT collection to commemorate Electra's 40th Anniversary (the Cure ended up contributing two versions of The Doors' \\"Hello I Love You\\", one great, one just a joke only 11 seconds long. The album itself, which I used to own, has some other interesting stuff on it too, in particular, a raucous hard rock cover of \\"Your So Vein\\" by the cheesy hair metal band Faster Pussycat). The song is augmented by the sound of seagulls and sea waves. It sounds like an old sea shanty, a sweet and mellow lullaby. Smith sings in a vocal style I've never heard from him before. It's in a low register and sounds quite lovely. Definitely something off the beaten path for the Cure, a phenomenal band who's already touched on more different styles of music (from jazz to metal, synth-pop to salsa) than any other I've ever heard. ****1/2<br /><br />Disk 3:<br /><br />The original ENTREAT is a rare collection of eight live DISINTEGRATION songs. A portion of the money from sales went to a charity that now eludes my mind and I'm unable to find any information about it online (bragging rights - I had this original release on vinyl back in the day. Sadly I was forced to part with it along with all the other vinyl I had collected in the 80s). This deluxe edition features ENTREAT PLUS which has been augmented with the rest of the songs to form a complete live version of DISINTEGRATION. The songs were recorded at Wembley Stadium in July of '89 and they all sound truly fantastic, especially for a live album. This is another disk that probably appeals mostly to fans. However, I find many of these versions to be quite compelling in their own right, especially the title track which I personally love even more than the studio album version.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Cure fans.rm a complete live version of DISINTEGRATION.

B000RZIGVS|4.0|This box set is very good however one big flaw.  It is missing season 3 disk 2 so four episodes are missing.  In its place was another copy of season 3 disk 1.  I am sure this was a packing error on the art of the factory but still the problem is there.
B004Y1USV2|3.0|I hate when bands hire singers from tribute bands to replace their lead singer (Journey). So it was natural for me to expect this CD to suck. But it doesn't. It reminds me very much of Drama, the other YES album without Jon Anderson. Benoit David reminds me more of Trevor Horn than Jon Anderson. His voice is smooth and pleasant. Since the core of the album is the \\"Fly From Here\\" suite, originally a Horn/Downes idea, it is no surprise that I hear \\"Drama\\" overtones. But regardless of where the music came from or who is singing, it's really a decent Yes album. After so many years, it's unreasonable to expect \\"classic\\" Yes. But as a Yes fan that has seen them live several times (with and without Jon Anderson) I like this album. I find it somewhat mellow, but there are definitely those core elements that made Yes great. At least now on tour you can see them perform songs from \\"Drama\\".
B005A1ER0I|5.0|This is, hands down, the best, most beautiful music that has ever been created.  End of story.  There's just an amazing amount of passion and soul wedged into every little nook and cranny of this amazing music.  Lots of synth sounds, but they're not overpowering, and fit into the orchestra perfectly.  There's even a little bit of dubstep influence in some of the later songs, and it's amazing.

1932735410|5.0|First of all, this book is not really by Rita since she passed away on May 15, 2010.  It is basically Rita's last edition with some additional material by Laurie Diethelm.    I just received the book and I am not yet certain how much new material has been added since the last edition (which I also purchased), but based upon the information at pmi.org, it doesn't sound like a significant amount of material has changed.  So, I would recommend people considering this book to also consider the 6th, less expensive, edition.    That said, if it is at least as good as the sixth edition, it is well worth the cost.  Rita's book is, as far as I can tell, the best PMP prep book available.  However, I'm a little bit annoyed by the fact that it is not obvious on Amazon that the book is not by Rita herself.  It sort of reminds me of the late Robert Ludlum's books (written, obviously, by someone else) and recent books 'by' Tom Clancy which are also written by another writer.  Let the buyer beware.
B005CSWOHC|5.0|This album is hot!! Some may complain about it's club appeal but she tried other genres and it didn't work out in her favor. The tracks are very good, fresh and very youthful. This should have been her first solo album. It would have really put her on the map. Don't hate, this is an awesome album so give the damn girl her PROPS!!!!

B0009XNUK0|5.0|Great album,my mom started crying after hearing some of the early Jackson 5 songs...Michael was truly great and a legend.
B003ITDN86|1.0|I'll have to admit, I didn't expect much from this album. In fact, the previous two albums, Underclass Heroes and Chuck were both boring and entirely forgettable, devoid of any fun and emotion. And, well guess what, they've released another boring and emotionless album.<br /><br />Honestly, I blame it all on the fact they hit an all time high with Does This Look Infected. That album had too many fun songs on it. Chuck had maybe two songs on it that were memorable (Welcome To Hell and We're All to Blame). I thinkthe only sing. On the previous album I liked was Walking Disaster. In addition, I saw them live last year, and Deryck Whibley was so obnoxious. People were leaving because of his constant swearing.<br /><br />On this album there's no memorable tracks whatsoever. The title track is a fun headbanger but then you won't be thinking about it afterword. The songs all sound the bloody same and try too hard to come off as dark and edgy, but wind up being boring and monotone.<br /><br />I'll agree that this album grows on you a bit. I think the 5th time I listened to it, I actually made it all the way through. The previous times I was so bored by the tracks I gave up by around track 8 or 9. But honestly, this is a clear case of a band who have all the fun sucked out of them. Avoid.
0553801473|3.0|A Dance with Dragons...obviously written by a very proficient author with no urge to get to the story. There is not a single climax in the entire book. There is building action with every chapter just to disappoint you when you find yourself back at the bottom of the mountain as the next chapter begins. Overall I was disappointed in George R.R. Martin for leaving us for several years without conclusion only to give us sufficient jockeying, politics, and character positioning to make Jordan and Tolkien's tales look like a haiku.<br /><br />Tighten up the story, throw in some crescendo on occasion, and please don't make us wait another 5 years for the sequel.

B003AIEOCY|5.0|\\"Exile on Main Street\\" is something that needs to be experienced by every rock fan.  Many of these songs do not get any air play outside of \\"Rocks Off\\", \\"Tumbling Dice\\" & \\"Happy\\".  I just went out and purchased the Vinyl reissue, why? Why??? Because I deserve it, that's why.  One song flows perfectly into the next.  This IS Rock and Roll. It sounds dirty and murky.  The Guitars sound gritty yet clever.  Terrific rhythm work by Keith Richards, no surprise there. AAAAnd Mick with the brutally honest lyrics... The guy sings like a man possessed!   Buy it, trade for it, steal it.. do whatever you gotta do to own it.
B0037QGS0K|2.0|Atom Egoyan must love watching people stare off into the distance for a really long time.<br /><br />Seriously. Every line of dialogue In the movie is followed by the character staring for a long time. If you cut the long stares out, this would be, like, maybe 20 minutes.<br /><br />I did leave a spoiler warning, but truth be told there's nothing to spoil because you saw it 24 years ago when it was called \\"Fatal Attraction\\". Woman thinks her husband is cheating. Woman hires a depressed whore to bang her husband, thus catching him in the act.  Woman falls in lovemwith the whore. Whore won't go away, blah blah blah.<br /><br />My best advice? Avoid.

B004EPZ08Y|3.0|Allow me to preface this review by saying that as you may have guessed from the trailer, this film is absolutely no different from the previous 4. So if you're going to this movie expecting a bit of a shake-up, you may want to skip it. But if you're going to this movie for how it should be viewed: good old gory and stupid fun, I'd say go right ahead.<br /><br />I was a little bit disenchanted with the series after I saw the fourth movie. Maybe it was because I was getting tiredof the series at the time, but I just wasn't drinking the kool-aid anymore. Furthermore I was dumbfounded when they were making a 5th movie, wondering how they could after the fourth movie was called \\"The Final Destination\\". However, the trailer looked fun, and some 3D gore fare will be some bang for my buck.<br /><br />I'm glad to report that this was a big Improvement. In fact, dare I say it, this has been a good year for fives. While I'm not a fan of the Fast And Furious movies, I enjoyed Fast Five in IMAX. And so I figured maybe the fifth FD movie could be good and I was surprised at how much I liked it.<br /><br />The dreaths are probably the most gory and brutal in the series. I kid you not, the filmmakers really do go for broke, the deaths in your face like a lunatic. In other words, death is pissed the frack off in this. One particular death pretty much sums up why I will never do gymnastics, in the same way that FD3 confirmed why I won't ever step foot into a Tanning salon, nor will I go on a roller coaster. Oh, and David Koechner is in this too, which I will say is a nice surprise.<br /><br />There is a lot of humour too. And thankfully so, because the previous installments took themselves too seriously. The spa scene had me laughing to the point of tears. Also, the deaths are beautifully campy, and I must say I found myself laughing at pretty much all the gore.<br /><br />In addition the 3D is a nice campy touch.  There's stuff flying out at you, like the Ships mast near the beginning, as well as the opening credits with the wooden logs, the burnt bodies and the broken glass and what not. In fact, I'd say go for the 3D alone.<br /><br />However, I can't give this a higher rating because it is exactly the same as the first four. I mean really, things happen the exact same way They did in the previous movies. I mean, as with the other movies, there's little to no surprise, so if you're expecting something fresh, do skip this.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is good for some light fun and campy, gory entertainment. If you liked the previous four, you'll like this one. If not... Well, you get the idea.<br /><br />OVERALL: 6/10<br /><br />Pros: Final Destination 5 is good, campy gory entertainment for those wanting just a bit of brainless (no pun intended) fun.<br /><br />Cons: The film is exactly th same as the first four. Plus, it would have sucked out loud in 2D, but 3D was good fun.h the wooden logs, the burnt bodies and the broken glass and what not. In fact, I'd say go for the 3D alone.

I was surprised to see how funny Justin was but shouldn't have been he is great on Saturday Night Live.  If you are looking for a deep movie this is not it.  If you are looking for a light funny movie that could be real and that could actually happen this would be it.
0439023513|3.0|Disgusted; this is the dominant emotion I am left with at the end of this beautiful series. Three stars because I was invested in the characters, however, nearly two stars because I wanted to chuck it in the trash afterwards.  I suggest sticking with the first book (which I loved) and hope the screenwriters can fix the mess in the movies.     **  **Spoilers**  **    I understand that Collins wanted to portray war as being a horrible event where everyone comes away with scars; however, I feel bludgeoned by it.  The finesse of the first book is completely destroyed, along with Katniss.     What is good is that I wanted to reach the end; I was interested in the futures of the characters.      What was not good is that the ending was weak and at least the last half of the story was deeply flawed.  As one of those that fell in love with Katniss, I wanted my voice heard in the dialogue, as well as her own; Katniss was mentally incapacitated for most of the book, and none of the multitudes that supposedly loved and followed her were given a voice.  I can handle heartache and tragedy, and it is certainly true that anything can break; however, the only thing really broken is this story.    Skip this one.
1934030597|4.0|I haven't used this manual much but from what I have looked at it looks very good at explaining things.  The illustrations look good and hopefully will get a lot of use out of this book so that I don't have to drive 45 minutes to the shop to get the little things taken care of.  I wish it covered my lefty shock but since those aren't that common I guess I can understand.  Overall, it looks like a good purchase.
1935670913|5.0|I'm NOT going to buy this book. I'm not a writer nor do I aspire to write.<br /><br />I'm a reader who buys books right here on good old Amazon, and I can tell you EXACTLY why this guy is so succesful. It's simple really - and most writers just don't get it.<br /><br />His books are fun, only 99¢ and they're mercifully short. Interesting characters and plenty of action, both physical and intellectual.<br /><br />Most books are so boring that they make me want to poke my eyes out and feed them to the cats (as a treat, not a main meal). Why in Dog's name do you need 500 pages to tell a story? Do you think I care about the buttons on her blouse? The decor of their home? The childhood event that you force me to read right in the middle of where there's something going on?<br /><br />This guy reminds me of Richard Stark and look how many books that sold? Imagine Parker but with a sense of humor.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're going to write the usual nonsense, marketing won't help you. If you want to be successful, just channel Locke and Stark and write some blazing 200 page books which are clever and have a solid body count, and I'll buy every one of them.

B004SC7B6M|5.0|I've been a Within Temptation fan for several years now since I first came across them on youtube.  I quickly began buying their music and when I heard they were working on a new album- The Unforgiving- I had to have it and so I pre-ordered it.  I have to say I was not disappointed in the slightest; although this album isn't quite like their previous work I still have not been able to find a single song on this album that I don't love.  I have to tell you, I'm extremely picky when it comes to anything and music is no different so when I find an album that doesn't have one bad song on it or even just a couple of songs that I can listen to but don't necessarily love it's extremely rare indeed.  I'm not a musician but I do know what I enjoy and I can listen to this album daily and not get bored.  I think it's great when a band keeps evolving their work; even though you love their previous material and love the way they worked those songs it's also good when a new album actually has some new sounds to it.  Too many bands stay in one area and with each album they release the material and sound is similar and it gets boring; you can't say that with Within Temptation's latest work and I highly recommend it.
0060887966|1.0|This is probably one of the most hyped-up books history. It's neither inspiring nor entertaining. Language of the World, Soul of the World, Omen, Destiny that's all what you get to read - repeatedly. The protagonist can talk to Desert, Wind and Sun and becomes wind himself. There is hardly any story and lot of preacher talk. The only impact it had on me was that I fell asleep every time I tried to finish it.

B000V39KDO|2.0|\\"300\\" may perhaps be the most blatant and pure expression of Fascism from the US film industry in the last 10 years, which is saying a lot. Democracy is portrayed as a drunk adolescent girl. Violence and blind loyalty are the only virtues. The Immortals are in blackface. Ironically, the movie is hyper-masculine to the point of homoeroticism. And thoughtless hero worship is the political substitute for government. It is a slathering, puerile, racist, ultra-violent fantasy for young white males. \\"300\\" is the film version of Samuel Huntington's \\"Clash of Civilizations.\\"    To be fair, in pursuit of the graphic novel feel, \\"300\\" does look good. But so did Leni Riefenstahl's \\"Triumph of the Will.\\" And that is exactly what this movie is, a cinematic display of the essence of Fascism. If you would like to see what fuels popular support for American war in the Middle East over the last twenty years, this is the movie to watch. In fact, a group of soldiers two rows in front of me at the theater understood the film's political message quite well. They literally came out of their seats in excitement.

B003Y5H5FQ|1.0|Where to begin?    The writer made the insult that she felt Horror movie hosts are irrelevant and that no one today would understand what one is. This both insults the audience and people like Elvira and the cast of MST3K. I guess she never heard of Nostalgia Critic, Rifftrax or Mystery science Theater 3000. Another insult to the audience.   This also diminishes the portrayal by the late, great, Roddy McDowall. She thinks people today would find Charley more relatable as a social climbing tool who abandons friends for popularity. Why?         The script has the character Ed make a lame joke about sexuality.     The script calls everything interesting (Peter's apartment) geeky    At ComicCon,  in front of Chris Sarandon (original Jerry Dandridge in 1985) the director of the remake admits he can't remember the plot of the original. He viewed this as a \\"good thing\\" because it meant he could go in fresh. This shows lack of respect for Tom Holland's film and original story.  Author D.L. Warner called this unprofessional.         The director of this remake couldn't recall the plot but said he remembered having nightmares from the movie as a child. He wasn't a child when the original was made. I was 3 when the movie was made and I'm almost 20 years younger than this director. This implies he's mistaking Fright Night for another movie made in the 60s and has no real recollection of it at all. I felt bad for Chris Sarandon, it was like they slapped him in front of an audience.     Peter Vincent's now and unrepentant alcoholic who makes a joke about being on the \\"day wagon\\"  near the end of the script, and only works up the courage to help drunk.  They forgot (or don't know) he was originally a nod to Peter Cushing and Peter Vincent. There is no growth for Peter Vincent.    Nearly all the effects are bad CGI. Amy doesn't flinch when the windshield is smashed in front of her face. She just screams on cue.     There are no nods to classic Hammer movies, as was the purpose of the original.    I like the Vampires of Anne Rice, Bram Stoker, Dan Curtis, Richard Matheson and Let the Right one In. They were all different.  They weren't made boring, contrived, over-used serial killers!     1985 Jerry enjoyed the hunt with cat-like instincts but there was still a human side. He tried to get Charley to look the other way. He grieved for a lost love.  Yet no humanity in this remake.  Ironic that he lost many of his powers and yet he's now more inhuman. In the remake he's a two dimensional serial killer, lacking depth or vampiric superiority.     Ed says (with lines written for the trailer) that Jerry's not brooding or love-sick. He's \\"The shark from Jaws.\\"  I don't want Jaws!  I want vampires! People have forgotten vampires can be terrifying AND seductive. Hollywood has a polarized idea that vampires can only be mindless killing machines or vegetarian Twilight rejects.  Vampires are more frightening when they have hints of humanity because it makes you uncomfortable when they do something malicious. This Jerry has no humanity.   He lacks the powers of the original Jerry; the abilities to turn into a bat, mist, wolf, control weather, and enthrall . He's gained new limitations; not being able to be photographed, which doesn't even make sense because there are NO mirrors in digital cameras!   He's stripped of all the powers that made him mysterious. He no longer acts like a thousand-year-old predator. He's clumsy where a teenager can find the serial killer.  ow is it this vampire wasn't found by police?     Dandridge should be a vampire, not the typical \\"Serial killer du jour.\\" He should be timeless. This guy feels...  dated. At one point Ed compliments how modern Jerry is.  He has his minion call him sir instead of master.  It's the first thing you're taught in creative writing class: Show, don't tell. Telling us he's modern is not the same as his BEING modern. And how does saying sir instead of master prove anyone is modern? The concept of mastersstill exist today.     In the original movie Jerry was a 1000-year-old being trying to survive and he felt like he might have been a thousand.  Now he just feels like some cliche serial killer.  If they wanted a serial killer why make him a vampire at all? What was the point of removing all his powers?  Rremakes are supposed to upgrade characters, not downgrade them.  It feels as` if the many explosions (which should be investigated) were meant to distract us from just how powerless these vampires are.     These vampires are like the Buffy vampires except with large mouths. She made this a Buffy Fright Night.  The original was a Dracula Fright Night. And it's just not the same. You strip powers and add more limitations and it takes away the mystique and the sense they are up against an ancient predator.     Why would Jerry risk so much exposure blowing Charlie's house like that? There is always an investigation when a residential home explodes, no matter the excuse.     Jerry in the original had Dracula's powers. This one is weak, can't even shape-shift or show up on camera.  New limits and less powers.  A vampire blowing a gas line and doing a car chase isn't a vampire.  It's a bad action movie villain you'd see against Arnohld.    It doesn't make sense that Jerry Dandridge doesn't show up on camera. It's a digital camera. There are no mirrors in digital cameras, and besides in the original Fright Night movies the vampires COULD show up on camera. In Fright Night 2 one actually took over Peter's show.     This should be ordinary people fighting ancient evil, not ordinary people fighting Jeffrey Dhomer...       I like my monsters to have powers and not mimick cliche criminal archetypes because Hollywood thinks 'supernatural' isn't in anymore. Look what they did to Jason in the new Friday the 13th! He's just some insane hillbilly!

I got this because I love Naomi Watts and Sean Penn, but they are wasted on this melodrama where everyone cannot just talk, but must be moving around like headless chickens as they deliver their lines.  And, somehow, brushing her teeth causes Watts (Plame_) to break down in tears.  And, Sooty Libby is no doubt a sleazeball, but I doubt that he's always-sneering sleazeball.    I'm going to avoid this director like super-halitosis from now on.

The lead character suffers from amnesia and each day when she awakes she experiences a world that's twenty years older than she remembers. Her development through journal entries leads to unsuspected twists and turns. I was sad when the book ended, not because of the ending or because of what will be, but because I'll miss the character I've come to care about.

B0000025VU|5.0|I understand that there are folks who've invested heavily in their expertise on Bob Dylan.  The quality and quantity of his work is amazing.  I'm not an expert, but I like his music too.  I'm just not much interested in someone explaining to me what a Dylan song means, or which of his albums is his best work.  That'll be my fun to figure out.    I have a hat full of records and cds from his titles.  But I only recently purchased and listened to Infidels.  I've had the 30th Anniversary \\"bobfest\\" for many years and was listening to it a few weeks ago for the first time in some time.  Tom Petty does a cover of License to Kill that stays in my mind for days.  So I ran down a copy of Infidels on Amazon.    I put the cd in my car and, it's one of those records that can stay in the slot and play over and over....and over.  There are several cuts that are infectious.  By the time I got to maybe round 4 or 5, I figured I should tell you all how much I like it.    It's great.  It rocks.  It isn't just Bob Dylan, it's a rock and roll band.  License to Kill sung by the writer didn't disappoint.  Infidels is a title that should have been more famous that it seems to be.  You snobs that dismiss it as flawed are knuckle-heads.

1594744769|3.0|I purchased this book after reading several positive reviews on Amazon. I liked the premise, but the writing style is clearly more in keeping with a middle school audience in mind. I am an avid reader and a retired teacher. I am familiar with many young adult books from such as the Series of Unfortunate Events which another reviewer thought had a similar style to Ransom Riggs. While the premise of the book was interesting, and the pictures entertaining, his writing style and predictable plot would be more of interest to ten to twelve year old boys.
B0018QCXGY|4.0|\\"Cloverfield\\" is a neat take on the giant monster running amuck theme.<br /><br />The film is presented as recovered camcorder footage shot by some unfortunate eyewitnesses.<br /><br />The whole story of how the camcorder got into a certain person's hands and the peripheral  events leading up to the monster's rampage are cleverly done. Out of the small group of people that the film follows, I found myself pulling mainly for the clown behind the camera. Hud's story was the most poignant.<br /><br />Though the movie has many dramatic moments, there's a lot of humor in here, and when the main theme plays during the end credit roll, you get the feeling that they didn't take themselves too seriously, and I think that's why the film works.<br /><br />Most people that slammed this movie had objections to the way it was shot, but I thought the \\"Blair Witch\\" style of shooting worked well considering how the story is told. The destruction special effects seemed pretty darn realistic.  It was the monster itself that I found kind-of unconvincing.  It reminded me of the Rancor beast that Luke takes on in Star Wars Episode 6 (interestingly enough,  Phil Tippett was involved in both projects). Plus, there are bound to be comparisons to \\"Godzilla\\".<br /><br />You never find out the \\"why\\" of \\"Cloverfield\\", but the ride itself is exhilarating.

B002IFT1ZA|3.0|\\"Game of Thrones\\" is a very well produced, filmed and written series. The cast is tremendous......Each episode draws the viewer into an interesting world of Seven Kingdoms.....At times it reminds me too much of the Lord of the Rings movies especially a decidedly older Sean Bean as Lord Ned Stark....the sex in this series while frequent and sometimes violent gets tiring after awhile....At times I wondered if it was necessary to show in the first place. Some might argue the violence and the \\"gore\\" that results is just \\"the way it was\\" in medieval times....Again, I found it tiring after awhile. The drama itself and the story are so intriguing and engaging that I continued to watch, but I thought the sex and gore were just \\"dull: after awhile. I thought the series could stand alone without it them. I don't think HBO or the media have to overdo such scenes to draw an audience. I don't get the allure myself, but then, noone seems to have an imagination<br />these days....so it has to be be on the screen...Else....who would watch? Oh my!

B003UESJH4|5.0|I've seen the movie at the theater, and knew that it was a keeper. A once-in-a-decade masterpiece. A must have!    When the movie came out in DVD/Blue-ray, it wasn't always simple (or possible) to find it on Amazon in anything but Blue-Ray, which I don't have (a glich, most likely--I spoke with an agent and they also could not figure it out). BUT I got an email a little while later telling me that it was in stock and given the link to order it.   I did, and I am not sorry. All is well.     The story touches on so many things: One of the themese is about the limitations of being Royalty (and even more so, a King), the lack of privacy, the loneliness (especially as a child--if one sees the movie they'd understand), the dynamics that do not consider one's own wishes, the oh-so-many people who advise (in thinly veiled command) regarding protocol, rules, regulations, what is and isn't acceptable...or 'done'.  Another theme is the thread of shame and how deeply it wounds, no matter the silver spoon or shabby hovel, and how empathy and acceptance heal, along withe acknowledgement of oneself for who one is, not their station or public role.  And about fear. And worry. Love and support. Connection and strengths. And more.  Great acting. Amazing directing. Rarely achieved excellence.  Go Get It!
B004XE0TDW|5.0|To every review dripping with arrogant, ignorant, blasphemous hipster snark, please save it. This album is a veritable masterpiece. Justin takes musical textures from the days before digital instruments (much like For Emma) and combines them with textures found more in 80s and modern music, like a REAL synthesizer (It's an instrument. One that you play. It's a Moog, not a computer) and a handful of auto-tuned vocals. He has proven with \\"Woods\\" that effects can be used artfully. This is a step forward that he obviously knew all the \\"retro revivalist,\\" Urban Outfitters hipsters would hate, and I like that. Regarding the songs, they're just gorgeous. Perth is one of my favorites, with beautifully warm electric guitars and striking melodies. The next few tracks continue to cascade over the listener a lush wall of sound that transports you to other musical worlds. That's the point of listening to music, isn't it? Anyway, Holocene is just perfect. The piezo guitar is the first acoustic-electric guitar since the Smiths that I actually thought worked. All of the studio musicians played their instruments, not computers, and the layers of sound make it a really memorable record. In my opinion, For Emma will always be the classic, but to compare the two would be unfair. They are both works of art, with different sonic stories to tell. Stop being arrogant, and ignore the hipsters who refuse to listen, and get yourself a nice vinyl copy (it sounds great). You won't regret a cent.

B00004U45G|5.0|No one else but the Black Crowes could have done such justice to these Led Zepplin tracks...why else would Jimmy Page have played with them?  I'd donate one of my children to science (I have no children, but that's irrelevant) in order to go back in time to see this show live.  One of my favourite Zepp songs is \\"Ten Years Gone\\" and I was firmly convinced that what that track they had reached divine perfection.  Then I heard about this disc.  After seeing the Crowes live several times, I had no doubt this Page collaborative show would be great, I just didn't know it would change my life for the better.  You would not regret adding this live audio gem to your music collection.  It's perfect for any time or type of listening mood, or at least most of 'em.  If your a Zepp fan, a Crowes fan, or just a good-music appreciator in general, there will be little to nothing that this show will disappoint you with.
B0030DIP7E|3.0|He's one of the best if he would quit making those weird songs.Start playing like the others,Johnson,Satriani that like to jam.There's not that many songs I like from Vai except one that really stands out,Sisters; on Passion and Warfare.Now thats Music!
0375826742|5.0|After reading a dozen or so reviews about how bad the Eragon series is has left me wondering about these so called experts criticizing his writing style. I have one question. Can you all please start giving us the name of the books you have written? I would love to read them.    I have read Eragon 4 times. Reading Eldest for the 3ed time, and will read Brisinger 2 times, all in anticipation of the 4th book. I must like them! Enough said.
0765324849|5.0|I just couldn't wait to buy this book when it came out. I have just finish the book, and the end, well it is bittersweet. I enjoyed reading it, it was like going back to Rapture just before everything felt apart. If you have played the game, you won't have trouble keeping up with the story, the names and the locations. It is easy to read and get hook up, it was intense to see trough the eyes of Bill Macdonough how Rapture begin and end. I love it.
1451629184|4.0|The first part of the book was in detail of what this awlful man did to this child of 11 years of age.  I put the book aside for a few days as I wasn't sure I wanted to read the rest.  But I did read the rest and was glad I did.  The detail given in the first part wasn't mentioned again in detail, but using other words. Being taken at such a young age made it eaiser for the man to brainwash her so to speak.  I can't even imagine having a baby without a doctor at such a young age.  Among the many other things she had to endure.  NO child, teenager or woman should ever have to go through what she did.  I admire her for keeping her children out of the public's eyes.  Jaycee seems to have good people around her to help her through this time.  I would like to learn more about their lives as time goes on.  She did a good job with her book.
B004L03B3S|1.0|If earnestness and heartfelt sincerity were all it took to make a decent film, this title would rank among the best.     But alas.  For all its seriousness and self-importance, this movie manages mainly to bore and frustrate its hapless viewer into utter despair. After suffering through the endless, vapid, eros-free first half of the movie which dealt with the brothers' early expressions of what can only be described as mild affection, this viewer realized he was witnessing a trainwreck. You keep watching it only to see if it can get even worse...and in this sense, it doesn't disappoint. Once I started laughing, it all fell into place. Even better, the later \\"love scenes\\" exhibited a saccherine, perfumed, paralyzingly STATIC quality that soon will have you wondering whether the dvd has actually frozen and your TV is about to switch to screen-saver mode.      Edward D. Wood, Jr., we have found your Double Bill!     By the way, if you've already made the mistake of purchasing this wretched time-waster, as I did, don't fret! Just invite a few of your sharpest, bitchiest, most merciless friends over for a bowl of popcorn and a six-pack, pop this piece o' crap into the player, then sit back and laugh yourselves sick. You'll get your money's worth!

B000002IST|1.0|For the record, I like a great deal of Phil Collins era Genesis, and all of Peter Gabriel era. For a time I actually liked where Genesis was going once Phil took over, but this album really let me down. Far too \\"formulated\\" and the lyrics are just plain too \\"pop\\" oriented and lacking in depth meaning. I found it both musically and poetically simplistic, and not what I've come to expect as \\"Genesis caliber.\\"    If their first album had sounded like this I probably never would have even considered buying any others that followed.    If no stars were possible to give, that's what I would have given it.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|I neither liked or disliked this book. I was definately expecting something more than what it was. I agree that Jack's baby talk and the breastfeeding got really old, really fast. The escape was unrealistic. The transition of going from one \\"room\\" at Old Nicks to another \\"room\\" at the clinic was booooooring!! And the reunion with her family was so, for lack of a better word, Stupid!! If my daughter was missing for years and was suddenly found, I think it would be a much more joyous reunion than this was.     Room was a dissapointment after reading Donoghue's \\"Slammerkin\\" which I LOVE and have read numerous times. Like I said, it's just \\"EH\\".
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Well MY first product review, The Turtle Beach Px21.  The product arrived right on time and it was was packed.  The first day of usage I noticed the Right ear did not work infact I could not hear anything int that Right ear which lead to me to believe their was a defect. I brough it to a local Computer store as soon as a employee picked it up he noticed the weight diffrence. He told me that it appears nothing is in the right ear. It would seem I receive a defective product. While the Left ear works WONDERFULLY I can hear everything and the mic works very well.  I am in process of doing a Refund I like the sound and the feel of Px21's but the right ear not working is something to bothers me about doing a replacement for it.
0439023521|5.0|In the last several years I haven't been moved a single time to write a review for any of the (probably hundreds) of books that I've read.     I'm moved today.    About four days ago I started in on The Hunger Games, a book which I'd heard a lot about, but hadn't yet had the gumption to delve into. I started slow, downloading the first installment to my Kindle thinking that if I didn't like it, I would only be out 5 bucks.     Four days later I'm finished the entire trilogy.     I literally could not put it down and found myself 'sneaking' peeks at the LCD-lit pages of my iPhone Kindle app while I was at work. The story is enthralling and the portraits of the characters are just as enthralling. Collins describes in the first pages the relationship between Katniss and her sister Prim's cat, Buttercup. In this small and simple description we learn exactly who Katniss is going to be, and we spend the next three books sucked into a world of action, romance, and ambivalent moments of will-she, won't-she that kept me absolutely riveted to the pages.     Throughout the entire ordeal I kept finding myself on pins and needles trying to figure out what was going to happen. In this day in age it's rare to find something so unpredictable and delightfully frustrating in a YA book. There were times during the story that I actually heard myself talking to the pages with a sudden gasp or an \\"Oh, no...\\" or a \\"That's heartbreaking...\\" It didn't take me long to realize that I was emotionally invested in every character that was thrown at me. I tried to puzzle out which male protagonist would be the one to finally win Katniss over, but the two men of the story were so evenly painted that I could find no obvious favoritism toward one or the other.     There is death and violence, but there is the always-indelible Peeta there to lighten the mood and make us a little sentimentally squishy in the aftermath.     A perfect balance of light and dark.     I mowed through this entire series infour days and when I was done I wanted to pick up The Hunger Games and start all over again. The story lingered with me long after I put it down, and I'm suddenly thrown into that silly pool of fangirls that will, inevitably, be standing in line for the soon-to-be silver screen adaptation of the series.     I sincerely hope they can do it justice.     May the odds be ever in their favor...    A.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This app is very promising. I can&apos;t say that I would find myself missing my cable at home, but not having to connect it to a computer with an option is great.\n\nWorks perfectly!
B0046MVVOW|3.0|Pros: The CD comes with a booklet with the lyrics to her songs. I dig that.        There are 3 songs I consider good enough to put in my master playlist.        At least 3 others are good enough for working out to.        Her reputation is a trashy, drunk college partier, which is sort of new in the pop scene. Interesting angle.    Cons: Her lyrics are rediculously amature.        The background instruments/synthasizer sounds like a cheap 4-track system rushed together.        In my opinion, her voice is mediocre, and none of the songs give her the ability to showcase her full ability.        Her best songs are the ones on the radio.    Surprise: Half of her songs are slow and introspective; a strange combination when her others talk about dancing and flirting with guys.    I would suggest just downloading the \\"radio hits\\" to save you the $20 of a new dual CD.
B0051CSIL0|5.0|This is now my favorite vampire movie. It was very well done. I am shocked that it didn't go to theaters considering some of the movies that do, e.g. Priest. I know this one will become a cult classic for those who love vampire movies and apocalypse movies. I was more afraid of the humans than the vampires!
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I downloaded this app excited because of the rave reviews. After downloading I went through and set alarms and all the special features I wanted. The next morning....no alarm.  :( not even the one that came already on the phone. This app didn&apos;t go off &amp; I forgot to shutoff the old alarm &amp; it didn&apos;t go off. I have tried reloading the app, deleting the old alarms. All 3 attempts have failed. My husband has the same phone &amp; had the same results. Wish I knew how to make it work. Really bummed!
B002KYHZLQ|3.0|Gardens of the Moon is a rather mediocre book, if you view it by itself. Events seem random, characters are insufficiently described and seem shallow, and plot lines are resolved in an unsatisfactory deus ex machina fashion - and I mean that literally. The book looks like a D&D campaign - and from what I found on the Internet, it started out exactly like that. And then it switched to GURPS.    However, the books that follow are brilliant and fix most of the issues I've had with Gardens of the Moon. I'm currently on book 3, Memories of Ice. The book is mediocre, but the books that follow raise its value. Get this book and read it, so you can enjoy the books that follow. If you like high fantasy - especially the high-powered kind - and complex plotlines where nothing is as it seems at first, you'll like the series. Steven Erikson is one of the best fantasy writers currently alive - in my opinion, only Martin and Sanderson write better stuff.    Also, this was my first Kindle purchase. Everything went well - however, maps are a bit too tiny to see properly on my smartphone.
0765322889|4.0|I find Erikson to be a nice alternative to GRRM and \\"Game of Thrones.\\" His world is still \\"dark\\" and gritty in many respects, but Erikson actually has likeable characters working to change it all. His prose is also excellent, far above that in most other fantasy books. I'd recommend fantasy fans at least try this one out and see how it fits their tastes. Overall I think the series is still too long and wordy (a big problem with most fantasy) but it's better than most.
B0045HCJ94|5.0|This movie is raw, gripping and excellently acted by its stars. The movie is well directed and is able to sustain your attention and interest. Well worth having in your collection.
0553386794|2.0|After hearing so much about this I tried again to get into it (having failed to finish the book 10 years ago or so) but still couldn't. I can understand why some people like the grittiness aspect, but I'm not personally interested in reading about an actual medieval world. By actual I mean that almost everyone is miserable, kind of like a Hobbessian worldview of life being nasty, brutish, and short. I prefer fantasy worlds that are different and a bit more enlightened, or at the very least ones where some of the characters are likeable. I found very few of the POV characters in this book endearing at all, and the ones that are get killed. Bleh.<br /><br />The world is also really low magic which I don't care for. If you are really into medieval politics and a very \\"gray\\" story, however, this is probably more your thing.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Movie is good and definitely makes you think.  Your mind needs to be more in the movie than just watching it.
B004UID2LC|1.0|After the last update, my antivirus software flagged this app as malicious. I have never had that happen with any of my apps. I uninstalled it. I'm not sure what happened with the update, but I don't want to take any chances.

B004OZOTSQ|4.0|I&apos;m pleased with the speed of the file transfers between phone and machine... didn&apos;t think uploads could be faster than with a data cable but I was wrong. \nMy only gripe is with the file system on the website. It would be five stars if I didn&apos;t have to repeatedly go up\/down directories a level at a time.  Tree style browsing badly needed.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|By far the easiest way to move files to and from the phone. I had one question, and it was answered within an hour or so.

B005CMGKTG|1.0|This movie sets a new bar for special effects in an Asian film. F/X are on a level with the latest Star Trek and Star Wars films. Unfortunately this is a poor quality DVD. The subtitle timing is slightly off and the picture quality is highly compressed. I'd wait for a different/better version
B0055D3EOG|3.0|This movie borrows a lot from other truly great horror movies like The Changeling.  Even the original Amityville Horror had more true suspense.  But it did have some original stuff in the latter part.  There were some truly creepy images and scenes.  I just wish that had not tried to explain everything so thoroughly about the spirit realm that they invented.  It would have been better not to have known exactly what was happening at times.  There was also a little too much comedy relief with the two technical assistants, where one joke might have been sufficient.  I am hoping that the director makes an even better horror film next time because this was an improvement over Paranormal Activity.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|\\"The Help\\" works as well as it does because it doesn't offer easy answers. This lovely and sometimes extraordinary film is not concerned with big sermons about clivil rights, religion or easy to swallow messages. The film is simply about behavior; how we should act, morally, towards other people, no matter who they might be. This thematic line is structured nicely throughout the film by zeroing in on a select group of people. This was a smart move since the backdrop of the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s is just too large a subject to truly flesh out in a 2 hour film. Because the film is about actual characters instead of predisposed, prepackaged lessons, the audience can take with them what they choose from the story (none of the characters have a major epiphany, each just starts to become aware of their behavior and effects, both good and bad- they all have so much more life to live). Surprisingly the film rarely gets melodramatic, and when it does it almost seems cheep and easy. Thankfully the films few flaws (structure, pacing, some silly dialogue here and there- \\"You broke her heart...!\\") can be overlooked due to the tremendous performances. Each actress is exceptional in their own ways with the wonderful Viola Davis stealing the film. Emma Stone is reliable here as always and proves that she can be funny and carry dramatic weight in the same film. I have always considered Bryce Dallas Howard to be a very accomplished actress and hopefully her scathing, pointed work will be recognized. Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain find a tender chemistry all their own. I have to say that \\"The Help\\" really, truly surprised me. I have never read the mega-selling novel from which it's based but I can tell you the film is a beautiful testament to American history and is a great display for some truly fine acting. For those who are turned off by sermonizing, preachy, obnoxious message movies (like myself), \\"The Help\\" is far from that. This is a tender film about real emotions and a subject that is rarely discussed in film today.ions and a subject that is rarely discussed in film today.
B00005LIN0|4.0|I'm a huge lover of opera, but I find I mainly connect in the opera house at a live performance, flaws, audience noise, uncomfortable seat and all. There, perhaps once or twice in a good season in a good house, I may experience transcendental moments in which I am completely transported emotionally by an opera. Opera video really needs to be understood as a different albeit related art form. The best of the genre use the story-telling power of cinema to make the emotional connection while still preserving and not overwhelming the stagecraft of opera.    This opera video is less cinematic than some. The sets and costumes preserve the feel of a production for the stage. As expected in a stage production it is a little abstract and doesn't embrace a realistic treatment of the grinding squalor of Catfish Row. However, the performances of the principals and all of the cast and chorus are compelling, and the singing is first rate throughout with as good a handling of dialect as you are going to get out of an international cast. This is a respectable and faithful treatment of Gershwin's opera - yes, it's an opera, an important piece of classical operatic repertoire. The score, a work of genius, is well handled here.    The power of this piece derives from its story which is rooted in a particular people, time and place. Attempts to transpose the story to somewhere else or clean it up are invariably damaging to the emotional power of the thing. I have to say in this connection I think the decision made in this production to get rid of the goat cart was unfortunate. Porgy and Bess is completely a piece of opera verismo. The indignity of that goat cart is very much wanted to emphasize the brutality of Porgy's situation. Other than that I think this production made the wise choices to be faithful to the libretto, and was a job well done.    The London Phil plays impeccably as always and with decent respect for Gershwin's intentions - I think, having listened to period recordings of performances of other Gershwin works conducted by the composer - but if there is one regret here it is that the playing strives perhaps for too much polish; the poor dears don't seem quite to grasp where the score calls for rawness, or even absolute frenzy. Tempii drag a bit slow in some places. Perhaps they should have sent the horn section to New Orleans for a fortnight beforehand. Perhaps the ensemble is a bit too large to give a completely authentic treatment as opera. The London Philharmonic would overflow the average house's pit by nearly a factor of two. If these complaints seem somewhat on a par with what you hear some Russians say about Tchaikovsky as performed outside of St. Petersburg, so be it.    Well worth watching. Very strong performances. Very strong singing. The thing managed to reduce me to tears several times. Highly recommended as opera video.

0061733199|5.0|One of my favourite books on my shelf - it's so useful, jam-packed with everything you need to know to survive in any environment. Luckily I haven't been in any serious survival situations yet besides falling off a cliff, getting stranded by snow storms, surviving a large earthquake and several bushfires (and I'm not even 30 yet). Even if you're a strictly city dweller you just never know, and much of this book is relevant to non-survival situations to. Get it. Read it. Be prepared.

0812550706|5.0|Ender Wiggin is a third, the third child in his family born. He was made because his siblings showed lots of potential but failed. They all need Ender to be the one. They need him as a commander to win the war against the buggers. Ender doesn't know if he's up to it. He is only six when they take him to the school to make him all that he can be. Sometimes the teachers might underestimate him though, even when he thinks he can't win, Ender might just have enough luck to pull through.<br /><br />So I went into this book not really expecting to like it all that much. It was recommended to me time and again, but I just though Sci-fi, space, really?!?! I really ended up loving this novel though. Ender was such a complicated but likable character. I felt complete sympathy for him, and just wanted to hug him and tell him he would be ok. They did some terrible things to him, the teachers, the students, his siblings, but still he persevered. This novel is about a lot more than just space and war with the buggers though. There are lots on underlying conflicts about the human condition. It was a well-rounded novel that left me hungry for more of Ender. This book was funny, but serious, easy to read but obscure. Orson Scott Card certainly knows how to write (well, obviously, he's won quite a few awards and such). I loved all the little details like the video game that Ender plays, it is described so well, that I could almost picture myself playing. The one thing that did bug me in this novel is Ender's voice. He was an incredibly intelligent and advanced six-year-old and because of his advancement, he never sounded like a six-year-old really. The insults that the boys spout out are the only real indications that they are all younger than teenage. There is some minor racists comments between the kids in the version I read, but they have been taken out of the newer ones. They didn't play a huge part in the novel though, so I think it just makes it a better read for kids to read now. I recommend everyone who hasn't read this book should pick it up. It was truly a fantastic read, that pulls at your insides.<br /><br />First Line:<br />\\"'I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ears, and I tell you he's the one.'\\"<br /><br />Favorite Lines:<br />\\"'You gold-plated fart,...'\\"<br /><br />\\"Or perhaps he had meant to eat the snake alive, as Peter in the mirror had done, with his bloody chin and the snake's tail dangling from his lips.

B002VRZEYM|4.0|Food Inc provides and insider's view into the food industry, and how consolidated, industrialized, and de-humanized a lot of food production has become. I'm not sure how biased of a perspective it is, but it definitely does get you thinking.     There are arguments by the food multinationals that at current food production levels (bushels/acre) there is not enough arable land to feed the world's population. The key to ensuring food supply is increasing the efficiency (bushels/acre) of the land so that enough food can be produced.     However, this makes you question the economic, human, and health costs of the industrialized state of the industry. It also shows how predatory a lot of these corporations can be in some instances. Informative and worth watching.

B001S86J0I|5.0|\\"Galaxy Quest\\" is one of the most fine and fun Sci-Fi Vids. Altho, meant as a spoof -- with many archetypical Sci-Fi aspects -- it actually demonstrates good Sci-Fi Vid production values. The plot, drama, dialog, romance, acting and actors are excellent -- as are the scenes, effects and Hi-Tech. The sets and settings are grand and galactic. Also, as are the audio effects and dramatic music. Also, as are the wheels-within-wheels of Sci-Fi reference aspects -- to \\"Star Trek\\", \\"Star Wars\\" and many other Vids -- and action-adventure in general. Also, as are the reversed archetypes. Especially great are the starships of the good and bad folks. As are the appearance of the good and bad folks. The Sci-Fi Con scenes are way funny -- as are the young geeks and nerds, who give critcal assistance to the \\"real\\" good folks. This Vid is a great Ideal of movie production in general -- that many folks can enjoy -- may The Farce be with you +++
B000V4NX04|5.0|Academy was right on target to select this one for the 'Best Foreign Film' award.<br />No proven formula used. No extravaganza. No special effect. Music is almost absent.<br />Just tells the story in the same pace and cohesion as the 'Stasi' agents' routine life.<br />Still recreated the chilling life and fear of the Cold War period.<br />Exposed the hypocrisy and dangers of Communist states - but in a restraint manner.<br />Tight script and very tight movie making. There are passages with really few words spoken - which augers well with spying activity.<br />Good acting too. And why not? The main agent in the film himself was being watched by stasi in his real life!<br />Worth watching and feel that thankfully bygone era.
0374531269|5.0|Although some of the authenticity of the author's story has since been called into question, it still doesn't detract from the experience of reading it, not for me anyway. I thought it was a heartening story when I first read it and I still do. I enjoyed the writing style which I thought was in keeping with the actual story. Whether this actually happened to the author, it has happened, does still happen and that is the tragic part

Unbelievable courage & lack of hatred are what comes through Jaycee's account of those 18 years. I was left wondering what I would have done. This book was written from the heart of an  innocent child with children of her own.
1250004349|4.0|....appalling, beautifully expressed mostly -- this story will break and begin to repair your heart, too.  Most compelling, mostly.  The heart of the story is riveting and very moving, and the characters interesting.  I turned the pages very quickly while trying to pause and absorb it all.  One is absolutely drawn in from the first page, but I felt about 80% of the way through the story lost a little steam.  I identified with the storyteller but found toward the end that I wasn't sure I liked her all that much.  She is partly noble and partly lukewarm, it seems....hard to explain.  In any case, a profoundly moving story based on actual events in France beginning in July 1942.  Impossible to fathom after reading this that many human beings don't believe we live in a fallen (though redeemed) world.  We also, however, are given great hope that the heart, mind, and spirit can grow and go on after tragedy.  We need to be reminded of these staggering events during WWII so we never repeat them.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|As a mother, this book was terrifying. It is the only word I could think of to explain how I felt reading it. It was so easy for this monster to kidnap this child. It was terrifying to read the circumstances in which she existed each day for 18 years. It was terrifying to know that so many people in the justice system could have done a little more and brought this thing to an end so many times. How does a person live like he did and no one know. He had neighbors, parole officers and family. It is just a terrifying story that could be repeated hundreds of times. Jaycee was a victim and a hero. She raised two daughters in the back yard of this monster's home. What he did to her was worse than criminal. The book needed to be written if for no other reason as to wake up our \\"ME\\" society and make us open our eyes and report any strange behavior of our neighbors and family members.

0553801473|3.0|I purposely waited after finishing this book to see what others were saying. There's no way this is a 5 star book nor a 1 star. A Dance with Dragons definitely falls in the \\"average\\" book category. Many of the chapters are full of useless, drawn out descriptions that I could have done without(way too much about food and sex). That being said, there is a lot here to enjoy. The old character lines are my favorite, the new characters are not. The shock at the end left me feeling angry so, I suppose in that manner, Mr Martin succeeded.<br /><br />I hoped for a fulfilling book, got a lot less than I wanted, and I'm sure I'll have to wait years for the next installment.

I can relate a little bit to each girl, as they are all going through issues, that I can remember dealing with myself as a teen.<br />I am surprised by how much I enjoyed this first book in the series. I was sure it would be juvenile and lame, but I was totally wrong. I cannot wait to start the next book!<br />Murder, mayhem and mystery surround the girls, and I am lovin them, and their secrets. The most intriguing secret is who the hell is \\"A\\"? Is it Alison, communicating from the grave? Is ig someone who means them harm? I can't wait to find out!<br />Overall, I loved the book. It is exciting, interesting and leaves the reader wanting more. I recommened this book to anyone who loves a good mystery. 4 STARS
0553801473|3.0|Great series but only two chapters on my favorite character, when I find that there are 5 chapters on Arya that may never get published, all so that he can involve more and more characters.  Imagine Tolkien devoting most of the book to the trials and tribulations of orcs, there could be stories there but why do we have to go over everything, and see the original Stark children so rarely?
0786715103|5.0|LTG Romeo Dallaire's memoirs of his ill-fated turn as commander of the UN mission in Rwanda during that country's genocide is the extremely balanced and heartfelt account of a soldier's horror at what he experienced, both in terms of the killing itself and the absolute apathy of an international community that stood by and let it happen.  I suppose the most Machiavellian among us might countenance arguments about how there were no compelling global security motives to become further involved in Rwanda, but for those of us who actually have hearts that beat in our chests, the thought of human beings being slaughtered, mostly by machete, at the rate of 1 every 11 seconds around the clock for 100 days alone is enough to justify involvement.<br /><br />In any case, Dallaire does an outstanding job at describing what he saw, what he did, and what he didn't do over the course of his year in Rwanda.  By reading some of the more negative reviews here, I see that the details of the workings (and non-workings) of the international system became boring for some readers, and the reliance on acronyms was tedious (imagine the alternative, though).  I'll cop to being an international affairs junkie with military experience, so I'm used to the acronyms and those same details about nation-states and international organizations are quite interesting to me.  I will also say, however, that I am a pretty severe critic of writing (regardless of content) and in my opinion, this man can write.  He can really, really write.  I found his prose to be extraordinarily powerful without going over the top, and there were more than a few points that I had to just put the book down and say, \\"Wow.\\"  I can understand how those who were looking for more of a Hotel Rwanda type story might have been disappointed, but given the fairly widely held opinion that the international community really dropped the ball when it came to Rwanda, it was great for me to read such a fair (though venomous) description of how that actually worked.<br /><br />Although this book definitely contains elements of LTG Dallaire's own personal struggles and demons regarding the genocide, and there are short vignettes of the human faces of the slaughter, the soul-searching and questions of good and evil don't necessarily jump off the page at you.  But if you're looking for an extremely well-written, humane account of how the world stood by while almost one million people were massacred, despite being informed of the situation time and time again both before and during the slaughter, I highly recommended Shake Hands With the Devil.at actually worked.

B004EPZ084|3.0|First time watching it, we thought it was a really funny film. Silly, but very funny. 'Ah, Toyota...' 'I don't make a lot...' The cocaine scene was hilarious, the whole audience was cracking with laughter which does not happen very often.<br />Fortunately, Jennifer Aniston played just a small role, so she could not spoil the film.<br />However, the second time we watched it, it was a bit disappointing. The jokes did not sound that funny and I found the whole film a bit dull. It is still worth killing two hours with a few good laughs, but I am not getting this one for my forever collection.
B004WJREMW|1.0|This must be one of McCartney's lowest points of his songwriting career. This album really sucks. I bought it - then sold it as a used album and never missed one track. It truly sucks.
B002ZG99TA|3.0|Good film until somebody thought that it wasn't exciting enough and the camera looked liked it was being held by somebody on their eighth cup of coffee.    Really, the script, the acting, it was all really good - why ruin it with over the top panning and camera shaking?    Could barely follow the last half of the film.  Like JJ Abrams and his abortion of a Star Trek film.
B00000DGXN|3.0|First of all the good - I enjoy the playing by all the players on this CD. Everyone is solid, and the solos are excellent.    But I have two main problems. First, I find the tunes themselves to be somewhat weak, particularly considering Metheny, Corea, and Burton are all excellent composers, and in fact one of my favorite things about Metheny is his genius with melody. Many melodies are pleasant, but none are especially memorable.    However, the thing that bugs me the most (and I am surprised to not to see it mentioned by others) is that the mix is bad. The piano sounds like it was placed about 20 feet further away than all the other instruments. This is especially noticeable during the piano solos, when it seems like the bass and drums have more presence than the piano, but even in the comping Corea is not well balanced with the others. For example, if both Metheny and Corea are comping, your ears are drawn to Metheny and have to strain to listen to what Corea is doing. Frankly, I am shocked that the CD was released this way.    For a similar type of abum that I think is MUCH better and includes Burton and Metheny with other players, check out the CD  \\"Reunion\\".
6305907145|1.0|I just watched this movie for the first time and could not believe it was touted as an Austen adaptation. Fanny's childhood years zoom by without ever laying a good foundation for the inequality she is subjected to at Mansfield Park. Without that, the rest of the story is meaningless. Why was she particularly drawn to Edmund? Because he's there, I guess. I certainly didn't get any more of a reason out of this movie. As well, there is heavy emphasis on Sir Thomas's slave trade when it was merely alluded to in the book. I think his characterization is all wrong. He comes across as just a cruel hard man, sort of disdainful of Fanny, while in the book he is not forthcoming with affection but at the same time has a genuine fondness for her. I actually couldn't stand the Fanny in the book because she was such a doormat, but at the same time I appreciated that she could very well have been a believable character in that era. The movie Fanny is nothing of this, which also ruins the dynamic of the plot. As for other characters, we don't see nearly enough of Tom to even get a feel for him. Same for Aunt Norris. The Miss Bertrams are almost superfluous here. I suppose the Crawfords are true enough. Perhaps it was too daunting a task to condense the entire novel into a single movie while staying true to the characters and plot, but this screenplay needed to be burned before it ever got put onto video. I could go on and on, but other reviewers have already spoken and I agree with them. The 1-star ratings, of course. Even if someone had never read \\"Mansfield Park\\" and watched this film, I'm not sure what they could make of it. I wanted to post my 2 cents' worth in hopes that the 1-star reviews will overtake the 5-star ones. We need to tip the scales because this movie is such a disappointment to Austen's novel.

1423113381|4.0|The Kane Chronicles, book one.     Carter and Sadie Kane are siblings, but barely know each other when the story begins. Their mother is dead. Sadie has been raised by her grandparents in London and Carter has spent his life traveling the world with his father, a well-respected Egyptologist. After a suspicious explosion destroys a precious artifact and their father goes missing, Carter and Sadie learn that the ancient gods of Egypt are causing trouble and the two children might be the world's only hope.     An entertaining fantasy/adventure with a healthy dose of humor. Can't wait for the rest of the series.

0375836675|4.0|Ed Kennedy, an aimless young man who is average in every way and disconnected from his own life, accidentally becomes a hero during a bank robbery.  Soon after, he begins to receive \\"messages\\" that he is compelled to deliver. As he impacts the lives of others with the mysterious messages, he finds himself becoming braver and more in touch with his own hopes and dreams. The book's positive message will encourage readers, teens and adults alike, to reflect on the meaning of their own lives.  Zusak's story will stay with you long after the last page.  Sophisticated YA literature.
B005F3XV62|5.0|this movie is totally awesome. kevin james was perfect for this movie. he nailed the character right on the spot. this movie is hillarious and i love the talking animals. any movie with animals being the maine characters is always good. i thought the story and the actors were awesome this is a great movie for everyone. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
0061689246|5.0|Except for the fair that is held in a mysterious meadow once every nine years, the people of Wall never cross the wall into the faerie meadow.    Dunstan Thorn meets a beautiful, enslaved woman at the fair and nine months later a baby is delivered to his doorstep.     Dunstan's son, Tristran, grows up not knowing his heritage. When he falls in love, he rashly promises his beloved that he will do anything for her. Not really taking him seriously, she asks him to bring her back a falling star.    Tristran sets off into the land of faerie in search of the fallen star, only to discover that the star is a sharp-tongued young girl. Their journey exposes them to great danger from a witch and the surviving Stormhelm brothers, who all are willing to harm the star for their own benefit. Along the way, Tristran's good heart leads to help which comes from unexpected places.    The writing is witty and lyrical. A couple of sex scenes make this more appropriate for mature readers.    The audio version is especially delightful as Neil Gaiman reads it himself.

0439023513|4.0|Book three in The Hunger Games trilogy.     Daring Katniss has survived the Hunger Games for a second time and has inspired the districts to rise up and revolt against the Capitol's tyranny. Unfortunately, she is still not safe, nor is anyone or any place she cares about.     Even in the rebel camp in District 13, all is not rainbows and butterflies. No matter what she does, Katniss can't seem to escape being a pawn in someone's game.     The love triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale definitely takes a backseat to the truly important themes in the novel. Collins wants us to think about the horrors of war (whichever side you happen to be fighting on), and the way we treat our soldiers once the war is over. How can a person ever really \\"go home again\\" and embrace life after that experience?     Bloody and depressing. However, though I did wish for a happier ending for Katniss after all she endured, a fairytale ending would not have made much sense in a book about war.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This DVD gives a very good workout in a short amount of time. Expect to work very hard within the twenty minutes each workout lasts. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I had to stop part-way through because all of the high-impact exercises seriously hurt my knees (to the point I could hardly sit or go up stairs).
0786868724|5.0|Along the lines of Tuesdays with Morrie (another EXCELLENT book), Albom writes about holy men--one the rabbi he grew up with and the other a minister in a poverty-stricken church in Detroit. Connections between different faiths and cultures abound. Though each man's story is powerful on it's own, it's what, deep down, they have in common that will inspire each reader to look inside themselves and find their own connections.     Whatever your personal beliefs, this lovely book will touch your heart and perhaps inspire you to slow down and reconnect with the things that are truly important in your life.
B004XC5LP0|5.0|My wife just purchased this wonderful Blu , thus rendering my dvd obsolete . That's o.k. , my dvd had replaced my widescreen vhs . This is thrilling on Blu , if you like this sort of film (disaster) . The cast is fun and interesting . Pierce Brosnan (in this film) strikes me as a good old fashioned rugged man of action . I'm a fan of the guy in general . Linda looks lovely . I really like Pierce's boss in this film too . I recognize him most for losing his head in John Carpenter's 1982 remake of THE THING . I've seen him in other stuff as well , but am uncertain where . He's perfectly cast to my mind . I love the diversity of the science team and the beautiful locations . Yeah , some of the dialog is pretty unintentionally funny . I don't know or care if stuff that happens on screen could actually happen . As a matter of fact , i'm certain MUCH of it could not . Roger Donaldson really does a swell job here though . He meted things out and i like morsels . FUNtastic and having a protracted and very exciting pay off . Gold standard in subtitles as well . Providing much more description (similar to closed captions) than MOST subtitles .
142311339X|5.0|The Heroes of Olympus, book one.     Percy Jackson fans will be immediately swept away by the next generation of heroes (and pleased to see some old favorites reappear). The inclusion of both Roman and Greek mythology adds a fascinating new dimension to the story and, of course, many new conflicts as well.     When Jason wakes up on a bus surrounded by a group of delinquents on a field trip, he is scared and confused to realize that they all know him, but he has no memories of them, or of himself or his life. Leo, an orphan with ADHD who cracks jokes to cover his feelings of never belonging, and Piper, a charming girl with a troubled homelife, soon find themselves united with Jason in a fight for their lives.     Upon arriving at Camp Half Blood, the heroes hear the prophecy that will set them out on a dangerous quest:     \\"Seven half-bloods shall answer the call,   To storm or fire the world must fall.   An oath to keep with a final breath,   And foes bear arms to the Doors of Death.\\"     And off they go, on a wild ride to try to free a trapped god and to save the world. Excellent, page-turning fantasy!

0375842209|5.0|Death narrates the story of Liesel Meminger, AKA the book thief. Death first encounters Liesel when her younger brother dies while they are on the way to live with foster parents. Liesel steals her first book, The Gravedigger's Handbook, at her brother's funeral (even though she can't read). Her foster father, Hans, uses the book to teach Liesel to read.     The Book Thief is set during the Holocaust, so Death is definitely feeling overworked. Liesel steals more books and forms close relationships with the people around her, especially Hans, her foster father, Max, a Jew hiding in her basement, and Rudy, a blond boy who admires Jesse Owens. Not every German in the book is a Nazi and Zusak brings out the beauty and the horror of humanity in its many forms.     Death jumps around and interrupts himself, which makes the beginning of the book quite confusing. However, this book is absolutely beautiful and heartbreaking and a must-read for older teens and adults.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|i loved this game on PC and discovered that it ports wonderfully to touch screen. i would have given 5 stars if not for the lack of screen lock. if the game is put down long enough to allow the screen to shut off it needs to reload, which takes some time.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Quick summary:  * Excellent cooling. Infinitely better than the stock Intel cooler (at least the ones given with the Core i7).  * This thing is BIG. Make sure you have the space. Measure your case before buying it.  * Installation requires minimal tools (just a screwdriver) but plenty of patience. Don't expect to be done in 5 minutes.    Relevant system specs:    CPU: Core i7 930  Motherboard: X58A-UD3R rev 2  Case: Antec Three Hundred Illusion Black Steel ATX Mid Tower (with all the wires to the annoying LEDs in the fans cut)    I bought the machine a year ago and decided to upgrade the CPU cooler. The stock cooler just wasn't cutting it for me. I had driven down both the core voltage (1.25V -> 1.00V) and QPI voltage (forgot), and replaced the thermal compound on the stock cooler with Tuniq TX-2. I'm thinking of switching this out for Arctic Silver 5 in the near future, just to compare the two. Anyway, the temperatures (unoverclocked) were still high: the hottest core would idle at 46C and the coolest at 39C. After a year I was fed up, so I bought this cooler to try and fix the problem.      Installation:    This is really the only downside to this CPU cooler. It took me about an hour (although I was distracted so this isn't quite a fair judgment). It is probably much easier to install this cooler before installing the motherboard. It requires placing a backplate, which is infinitely easier without the case in the way. Also, the instructions are not for the faint of heart. The diagrams are helpful, but the words essentially amount to: \\"install backplate\\" and \\"install cooler\\".     In my actual system, the backplate hits the case. I had to bend back some of the backplate (the parts for the installation on an AMD socket) to make it fit without pushing against the case (not the outer wall but the part of the chassis that holds the motherboard). Just in case, I added some extra electric tape to help prevent shorting, although I doubt this is going to be an actual problem.     With the backplate in place, the next fun part is installing the cooler. It is massive, so installing it with all the other parts in place is tricky unless you have a 2 year old's hands. I ended up having to use pliers just to get the fan's connection the motherboard in. The cooler is also held in place in a weird way. The cooler isn't screwed directly to the motherboard via the backplate. Instead, you have to put a little frame between the surface that touches the CPU and the heatsink, and then screw the frame down tightly to the screws mounted in the backplate.      Tightness:    The cooler is held to the CPU by a combination of screws and springs, meaning that the cooler is held very tightly against the processor. This is clearly much better than the pin/clip design of the stock Intel cooler, which only loosely holds on to the CPU.       Cooling:    For an air cooled system, although I have little to compare it to, I am very pleased. In a room at 22C (72F) my system now idles much colder than it used to. I have overclocked the system and raised some of the voltages, so the numbers I am giving here are not quite comparable. Although I have run Prime95 for 30 minutes to check system stability, I have not yet run it overnight to test it fully.    VCore: ~1.28V  QPI voltage: somewhere around 1.2V  Base clock: 160MHz (up from the default 133MHz I used to run at)  Core Multiplier: 22 (although I have a lot of settings turn on that drop the multiplier when not necessary)  Memory multiplier: 10 (running 1600MHz memory)  Uncore multiplier: 20 (I read that this should be double the memory multiplier)    Idle:    Clock rate: 1920MHz  Hottest core: 41C  Coldest core: 34C    Full Load (Prime95 with 8 workers):    Clock rate: 3360MHz - 3520MHz (it can't make up its mind between 21x and 22x)  Hottest core: 75C  Coldest core: 67C    As far as I can tell, these are great temperatures, meaning that the cooler is really doing its job.
0385738757|5.0|Maze Runner trilogy, book two.     Thomas learns more about WICKED and comes (briefly) to a place of safety. Then all crunk breaks loose and the Scorch Trials begin. Thomas and the other Maze survivors set out to cross the Scorch, the most decimated section of desert in a world of deserts created by solar flares. Their goal is to reach the safe haven, but they have only a limited time to do so. Along the way, they will encounter many more of WICKED's dangerous variables. Thomas doesn't know what, or who, he can trust, and readers will be questioning right along with him. What is the true purpose of WICKED? Are they, as Teresa insists, good? Is this for real, or merely another test?     All I can say is that the wait for book three will be a long one.

0385737955|5.0|Maze Runner trilogy, book 1.     When Thomas awakes in a strange place with no memory of who he is, he finds himself stuck inside an ever-shifting maze with a group of other teenage boys. None of them know exactly where they are, why they are there, or who they were before. However, these boys are survivors who have managed to create a workable society for themselves. Each has a job to do. Thomas remembers little of his former life, but he knows that he HAS to become a maze runner--a dangerous job that involves exploring the maze to try to discover the way out.     The day after Thomas arrives, a girl arrives. She is the first girl ever to come to the maze and she carries a message that will change everything. Lead by Thomas, the group must make a desperate effort to escape the maze or die in the attempt.     High-action dystopian fiction that will appeal to fans of Uglies, The Hunger Games, and The Forest of Hands and Teeth. The cliffhanger ending will leave readers hungry for the next book in the trilogy.

B004OZOTSQ|4.0|Good ui and works well.    Uses:  Useful to me in that I can easily access files between my five android devices, and maybe my comp when I'm on it at work.    Why you should care about wifi:  avoid eating up your capped (or soon to be capped) data bandwidth by downloading the same media to multiple devices just so it's available on each (uploading files to dropbox, amazon, etc and then downloading them to a device five feet from the source device eats data too!) by keeping the file swapping inside your wifi network - if it doesn't go into/from the cloud then it doesnt eat up isp data and that's what makes this app so valuable    The dev:  I've bought apps from this dev and he/she does respond to questions with useful info.    Negs:  The app is setup to pretty much start working at launch.  While this is normally good as it helps the less UI savvy get going, it could also cause someone to completely forget to set the pswd.  Also, not having a clear \\"turn this off button\\" could cause many to forget to actually exit the app.  Having the exit option buried one level into the oft unnoticed menu doesn't help.  There should be a clear off button in the main form's ui.    Again overall a good app.

0385523912|5.0|Nothing to Envy is an eye-opening book.  We think we know North Korea from the tidbits we get on the news or even from Lisa Ling's undercover investigation.  But you can't know North Korea until you know its people.  This book follows the lives of 6 North Korean defectors that really do become a part of you. I now pay so much attention to any information I get on North Korea, as if I had my own family there. This book is amazing and has truly opened my eyes.  We are so blind to the plight of the North Koreans because it is not represented in our news channels or newspapers.    I wish this book was required reading in schools and universities.

B00005JKTF|1.0|8/12/11  This is not actually a review of the movie \\"Charlotte Grey\\" as such, but to provide some information people buying this film might like to know.    Contrary to all I have read in Amazon's film description of this film It was not based on the life of a Scottish woman married to an RAF pilot but an Australian.  This came from an international news report shown earlier today. The report was on the death of Nancy Wake a few days ago in an English nursing home. Nancy Wake came from Australia about the time Germany took over France. She worked in the French underground rescuing downed pilots and others the Germans were after. After some training in England she returned to France and became THE most highly decorated of all in the French underground for her exploits against the occupiers, especially after the arrest, torture and execution of her husband. She was one of the most sought after of all the underground operatives by German military, but was never arrested, probably because they were looking for a man, not expecting that a women was that capable.     The news report included a segment of an interview with her a few years ago (she appeared to be in her eighties at the time) in which her closing comment on her war service was that in her opinion \\"the only good German was a dead was a dead one. The deader the better. And that is all I will say about that.\\"    The news report specifically mentioned the movie \\"Charlotte Grey\\" being based on events in Nancy Wake's life.

B004VUP8WK|1.0|Being a Morbid Angel fan from the beginning in the mid-late 80's, they easily became one of my favorite bands once the Thy Kingdom Come demo and Altars album came out. Extreme, tight and redefining. I've liked everyhing in the catalog until now. I even liked Heretic except for the production, as there were some decent moments.    This release however proves to be a lowest of low point for the band. As with most of the other unkind reviews the 3 metal songs would have been average at best on previous releases. But the industrial songs are really laughable. This is Morbid Angel vs Combichrist. As an example Rudikult could have been a hidden joke track and it still would be terrible. Morbid Angel covering Taylor Swift would have been better.     It was interesting seeing them on the 2006 tour w/ David Vincent a few years ago, it didn't seem like the same band. Vincent looked disconnected from the band. It was a sign of the disappointment to come. They were crushed by the opening acts Krisiun and Behemoth.    To bands like Behemoth the death metal torch has passed!
0812548094|2.0|I wish I could restart this book and count how many times Richard or Kahlan says to the other that they love the other one.  I tore through the Sword of Truth in 3 days, folks. 3...days!  I have had book 2 for almost 3 months and I am only on page 256.  Seriously, Richard and Kahlan's relationship is disgustingly unhealthy.  They are so \\"in love\\" that they are co-dependent on each other just to breathe.  It's really sad.  If you don't believe me, try to focus on how many times they say, \\"I love you.\\"  It's literally every third page, if it's that far in between.      We are not stupid as readers, nor do we have short-term memory loss.  We don't need to be reminded how much they love each other ad nauseum.  It's pathetic.  Oh, and Richard is going to have a collar put on himself again.  Really?  That's the best plot device Goodkind could come up with?      (Sigh).  It's almost as if the Sword of Truth was written as a standalone book, but once the publishers saw how popular it was, they decided they had a new cash cow.  The differences between books 1 and 2 are glaring and painful.  We go from loving these characters and caring about them, to finding them unbearably pathetic and annoying.  I am going to continue plodding through in hopes that it gets better.

0439023521|5.0|This book basically holds a carrot in front of your face the whole time. Tempting you to read one more page just one more until you have read 3 books in a week. All I can say is she wrote the characters so well I now miss reading about them and wonder what they are up to. It is one of those book series that makes you feel empty and sad now that there is no more. I am pretty sure I loved the supporting characters more than the main heroin. Petta is amazing and probably does not exist in real life an extinct creature now in days.
0553582038|2.0|... and actually, it probably could have been condensed to 100 pages.  The very few interesting sections (i.e. the bits about Arya) were precisely very few.  Most of the book was Cersei and Jaime and Brienne.  Cersei is approximately Lady Macbeth and nothing really needed to be said, except that she's neurotic and evil.  Finally by the end of the book she got locked up.  Jaime is really kind of tedious.  Brienne... I'm sympathetic to her, but she sort of wandered around a lot, and accomplished exactly nothing, except that she got a little bit eaten.  Why did we have to spend so much time on her.    I'd excerpt, pretty much, just the last couple chapters of Cersei, the stuff about Dorne, and the Arya stuff, oh and the Kings moot - and skip the rest of the the book.  I skimmed the vast majority of it.  SO boring.  At least the book before, and the book after, were enjoyable.
1422161978|4.0|I just finished reading the new Experience Economy (2011 version) and am already putting the ideas to use in a new business strategic thinking event. Over the years I've read virtually everything Joe Pine and Jim Gilmore have published, and spoken at conferences with both of them, most recently with Joe in Rhode Island. It is always inspiring to chat with these gents. I love taking their ideas and transposing the broad multi-sector examples into ways tourism business and destination marketing organizations can discover the opportunities that can emerge from embracing the Experience Economy.    What struck me about this book, is that it really tied a lot of their ideas/books/concepts together from multiple sources. What was very new and extremely beneficial was the section on TRANSFORMATION. I loved their first book which really focused on information and insight on the EXPERIENCE level. Being in the education/training business, transformation is what we do, so while I enjoyed the entire book, the last two chapter were particularly inspiring.  But if you are new to the Experience Economy, I strongly encourage you to purchase their earlier book. Read it first, then move on to this one ... great combo for shifting your thinking up the scale of economic progression from experiences to transformation.
0553801473|4.0|Finally we're back to reading about characters that I care about.  The first couple books were great, but in a \\"Feast for Crows\\" nothing happened, and worst, nothing happened to characters I didn't like.  Now we're back to finding out about Bran; some more stuff about Arya (yay!); and best of all lots about Daenarys, Tyrion, and Jon. Thankfully there was nothing about Sansa nor Brienne (both of whom are nice, but both of whom are honestly kind of boring); and thankfully little about Cersei!!! Cersei is interestingly warped, but I can't read 300+ pages about her, and by the end of the previous book I wanted to scream.  Jaime isn't even interestingly warped (his back-story is complicated, but in practice he's just some dude who f***ed his sister), and I really wasn't interested in reading 300+ pages of HIM.<br /><br />The book is pretty slow, but that's fine.  Some of it I skimmed, especially when there were 20 odd page chunks of digressions about the family life, philosophy and genealogy of some character I'd never heard of and was unlikely to hear of again.  Let's be honest, about 25% of the the series is the plain and simple wankery of some guy geeking out on building the arcane details of some imaginary world that any sane editor would red-pen.  But the rest of it is great, and enjoyable.  This was a welcome addition to the series.  Finally.

0553801473|2.0|I was extremely excited to get my hands on ADWD especially after a disappointing AFFC.  But, after reading it I am only dissappointed with this book as well.  Those fans of the Robert Jordaan \\"Wheel Of Time\\" series are probably experiencing a strong sense of de ja vu as I am.  The first 3 books in A Song of Ice and Fire were spectacular as were the first several Wheel of Time books.  Nonstop action and excitement and you never knew what was going to happen. But Dance and Feast were huge dissappointments.<br /><br />This series is fizzling out just like \\"Wheel of Time\\" did after the first several books in the series.  The later books for the Wheel of Time series were just massive books full of fluff and filler with no action.  Martin is doing the same thing as Martin did.  Fill up books with exaggerated descriptions of every single detail of every person, building, tree, rock, bird, fish, animal, and cloud possible.  I found myself not really reading the book but skimming through it to avoid having to read the minutia details of everything.<br /><br />I'm afraid that the book industry has changed from the good old days of Dragonlance, Riftwar, Shannara, Lord of the Rings, where you had a spectalur trilogy with the third book finishing the story.  Now, once a writer has a popular series, it never ends.  If a writer gets people hooked on the first several books, they just drag it out to sell more books.  We all loved the first 3 books.  We are all hooked and have to keep buying the next book in the series no matter how bad it is so that we can find out how it ends.  Jordaan did it and now Martin is doing it.  It is clear that this is exactly what Martin is doing.  The \\"boy\\" that was introduced in this book was clearly never intended to be in the story from the beginning.  He is just another character added with the intent of dragging the series out to cash in with more books full of nothing but fluff and filler.<br /><br />If you cut the fluff out of AFFC and ADWD youhave half a book.  George, please stop writing to make us buy more books and finish the story.<br /><br />Save yourself some money folks and wait to buy Jordaans books in paperback.
0385533829|5.0|This book is a good read for fans of Dan Brown.  I did enjoy the plot of The DaVinci Code a little more, but I appreciated that this book was set in the United States, and explored symbolism that is hidden right here in our nation's capitol.  I read the unillustrated version, and wished there had been some images to illustrate some of the symbols and architecture that are discussed in the book.  When I went to buy a copy for my father's birthday, I came across the illustrated version, read the positive reviews, and decided to give it a shot.  I'm so glad I did.  This book is beautiful - far too nice to be buried on a bookshelf, and the illustrations offer just enough information to supplement the enjoyment of the story.  After seeing this version, it made me want to go back and collect the illustrated versions of Dan Brown's other books - any one of them would make an excellent gift!
B0040QYROK|2.0|Watching now, great...nice extras nothing too special. I will say I'd suggest pickingnthis up on a store since it comes in a rather collectible holographic outer sleeve and mine is damaged with scratches either caused in packing etc, if you find it in a store you could pick one that's not damaged.    I stll need to research a bit more, but to me it's odd to have to pay high prices on public domain material such as this. Sure the restoration takes effort but it's not as if THEY shot the film, starred in it etc. I need to see if proceeds go anywhere but their pockets.    Edit: cannot recommend this, when many of the new footage appears not only are the frames offset to bottom, they are also set too far to the right with uneven bordering on either side, plus black border on top, which means a portion of the frames are being cut off on the bottom? I'd wait until a better version comes out. The strong point of this version is the original score, and... The new footage but it seems sloppily done with the borders being so offset, once I noticed it it bothered me way too much.
B005B7IPG8|1.0|. . . the fifty cents I paid to watch it. There was no mystery, no puzzle, no story, just a sequence of random, and very mundane, pretty realistic events. If I had to guess the theme I would've said: some people are happy, but some people are lonely, or possibly, everyone's a heavy drinker and you will be too after we've had our two hours worth of say. In fact, the best part of this movie was the burrito I ate while watching it. So, watch this movie if you want to be annoyed by most of the characters, and bored by the others.
1451629184|3.0|THE BOOK ITSELF IS O.K. I WAS AWARE OF THE INCIDENT BEFORE I ORDERED THE BOOK. I REALIZE IT'S A STORY ABOUT A REAL EVENT, BUT IT IS DISTURBING TO READ AND I'M NOT EASILY DISTURBED. I ALSO GET THE IDEA THAT IT IS AS MUCH A THERAPY FOR THE YOUNG WOMAN AS IT IS THE STORY OF HER ABDUCTION. THE ONLY UP SIDE TO THE WHOLE EVENT WAS THAT SHE WASN'T MURDERED LIKE SO MANY OTHERS. CALLING IT A MEMIOR IS APPROPRIATE, IT WOULD MORE APPROPRIATELY BE CALLED \\"A DISTURBING MEMIOR\\".
B004WESFZW|4.0|I had read a few commercial reviews of this movie which were less than positive.  Despite this, I tried it, mainly because I like the actors, and because a film based on a PK Dick story is always tempting.  My overall view is that the film is well worth watching.  The main actors make good use of the material and the tone of the film matches most Dick stories that have been filmed successfully (in my view).  The characters in most PK Dick stories seem to be fighting against hidden forces which underlie our reality.  The Adjustment Bureau is no exception.<br /><br />Oh, and I hate the tediousness of travel.  I would LOVE one of those hats.

B001152TL6|2.0|I really enjoy these kind of films and thought the flick was decent at best.  Some people I have talked to swear this movie was simply amazing.  I had a hard time sitting in my chair the entire length of the film, I really hate ending movies early and always like to finish them so I did.     The movie tells the story in a way that you have to really pay attention to, everything seems random while most scenes are very deliberate.  Leaves ya to really do some figuring out on your own.  All in all I somewhat enjoyed it, I will probably never watch it again, nor will I recommend it to anyone.
0316098329|3.0|The topic sounds intriguing when reading through the reviews and summary. And it has all the elements that would entertain a reader but I found myself continuing to read it just to see if they finally escaped. I didn't like any of the characters - at first just Ma and Jack. And that's not to say I disliked them, I suppose my attachment to them was neutral. If you've read Precious and were able to decipher her broken English then you will have no problem keeping up with Jack. One of the things I found most disconcerting was the fact that Jack was so confused about the outside world when he'd been exposed to TV his whole life. I'm glad I read it, it's a very easy and short read. But I would not recommend it to anyone.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This is a nice starter automatic watch, especially, if you are reluctant or unable to invest in the pricier units on the market today.<br />However, I find the case and strap too small for an adult man, and that's a shame because it's a very elegant, minimal and attractive dial.  Perhaps, this watch is more suitable for a young child or a woman...

B004LWZW4M|5.0|The Review:<br /><br />There have been many larger than life heroes of the silver screen. Kurt Douglas' Spartacus, Russell Crowes' Gladiator, and Mel Gibson's Braveheart. Now to that august company of heroes must be added Andy Serkis' Caesar from Rise of the Planet of the Apes. But Caesar is unlike any of the others. Though he is every bit as heroic, and in many ways more complex, Caesar is a chimpanzee.<br /><br />Rise of the Planet of the Apes is the prequel to the 1968 classic, The Planet of the Apes starring Charleton Heston. Rise tells the story of how it came to pass that our simian cousins skipped ahead of us on the evolutionary ladder. The story of Rise is told in such a way that it fits perfectly within the continuity of the original film. By the way, I highly recommend seeing the original as it really is one of the pillars of dystopian sci-fi. When you watch it, keep in mind that it was made more than 40 years ago and how cutting edge it must have seemed to that audience in terms of both story and special effects.<br /><br />After seeing the trailers for Rise, I expected a good movie. What I got was a great one and it is my favorite movie of the year so far. From its opening sequence to the closing credits, Rise hits all the high points for which storytellers strive. While I thoroughly enjoyed Thor, Captain America and X-Men First Class, Rise had an emotional impact well beyond what I experienced with those other great movies.<br /><br />Before the end of Rise you will come to know and love Caesar, a combination of computer generated imagery and the movements of actor, Andy Serkis, who also did the movement for King Kong in Peter Jackson's amazing film of the same name. Serkis' performance is all the more amazing since it's composed almost entirely of his motion captured facial expressions and body movement. Not many actors can do their best work under such restrictions. Andy Serkis is in a class by himself in this regard.<br /><br />Rise plays on our collective fascination with primates other than ourselves. Chimpanzees are eerily like us. They have personalities, live in groups and even wage war against other groups of chimpanzees. The ability of Rise to tell a story, in which apes and chimpanzees are every bit the star that their human counterparts are, is a rather amazing bit of film making. This is obviously the result of a lot of special effects, but I never once saw anything \\"fake\\" about the film's FX. Yes, intellectually I know that chimps were not taking direction or immersing themselves in the method school of acting. But damned if every scene didn't look as if real animals were on screen. Only King Kong and Avatar have ever made me forget I was looking at computer generated effects the way Rise did.<br /><br />Rise of the Planet of the Apes has as much action as any of the blockbusters of the summer of 2011, but it has a lot more heart. Caesar is part superhero, part freedom fighter and part Moses. If that sounds ridiculous, trust me, it isn't. Rise, by focusing on a non human character manages to explore the very essence of heroism, and our desire to be free. In many ways Caesar is as \\"human\\" as any of us. And on that somewhat corny note, the only negative thing I have heard about this movie was from a co-worker, who said he heard that it was \\"corny.\\" Well, I am as jaded as almost anyone in the concrete jungle, but I feel sorry for anyone who can't let themselves enjoy the awesomeness that is Rise of the Planet of the Apes because it's no longer cool to let a movie move you. For the rest of us-hail Caesar!!<br /><br />FTC Advisory: We purchased our own tickets.han ourselves. Chimpanzees are eerily like us.

B004WKOCP8|5.0|All you people who want Incubus to be the 'old' Incubus want them to be performing monkeys doing the same thing over and over again. You people remind me of the people who pay organ grinder monkey performers to do the same thing again and again. Everything about Brandon Boyd and Incubus is Heart and Soul and this album is no different. Let me ask you people who are displeased with this effort, have you listened to the entire songs, one by one? I bet the answer is no. You people don't know good musicianship when you hear it right in front of you! These guys, Incubus are true musicians in every damn sense of the word. I give this album an A+ for continued evolution in song writing and musicianship. Stop whining over great music. This was not a waste of time. Because of this new sounding album I am even a greater fan than I was before.
B004B32532|4.0|\\"Santa Sangre\\" (1989) is a fim by Alejandro Jodorowsky. It is about a passionate and mad mother and her hypnotic influence on her son's life. The surrealistic imagery abounds in this film as one is taken down through a hallucinatory and macabre world set in Mexico. I found this to be the most accomplished film I have yet to see by Jodorowsky where an intense emotional element pulls the ideas together. The twist near the end also completely redefines the earlier parts of the film into a whole new light and makes this a film worthy of seeing again. Jodorowsky surprisingly doesn't appear in this film as he does in many of his other films, but his four sons do.<br /><br />The blu-ray looks wonderfully gritty and comes with many illuminating special features such as a making of featurette, delected scenes, a documentary on the serial killer Goyo Carenas who inspired Santa Sangre, an interview with Jodorowsky, and a couple of short films by Adan Jodorowsky and Simon Boswell.
1590171993|5.0|This is the story of one man's metamorphis throughout his life. In order to have understanding, one must read this book with knowledge of the story's timeline. ( Not much was known about mental illness, marriage was the ultimate committment, most people lived in America on farms, and women's roles were as homemaker-- their rights were not considered to be of importance.)   Without being born pre 1960, I believe this would be a difficult read.  But looking at this novel from 2 perspectives, that of today, and yesteryear, is what makes this novel so rich and interesting.     This book could easily be the story of any person's life, and the interest is in how the main character handles his predicaments and passions, and his growth throughout the book.   Like everyone else, some things he is active about, some things he is passive about, and some issues he cannot resolve at all, while others issues stay on the backburner until his growth-of-character allows him to act.   The book is about the life of a man raised on a farm who becomes an English professor.   His wife's mental illness is the ever-present background for his life.   Both he and his daughter become sacrificial lambs to his wife's illness, which in many ways, prevents him from fulfilling himself, and ultimately appears to destroy his daughter.  As a misunderstanding person of his time, he deals with his wife's craziness the best he can, but still manages to blame himself for her unhappiness.  Of course, it is easy to say from today's perspective, that he shouldn't have blamed himself, what he could have, should have done.  But to look within the knowledge of his time, he was coping the best way he knew how.    My favorite part of the book, is later in the book, when he learns how to defeat his old rival.  He develops a boldness  that never was a part of his younger years.  He fearlessly and intelligently decides that he will teach what he loves, and will not let anything stand in his way.  And he finds a wayto do it.  This is what his true heroism is all about.  He becomes his own hero by dropping his fears, and defeats the enemy by meeting him head on.    The character's true growth is at the end of the book, when dying, he reflects on his failures,and realizes that failures don't matter.  When failures are taken out of the equation, he has really had a good life.
0345529057|5.0|Amazon's service was on target as usual.    The books themselves are great.  They run to average of 1000 pages each but I am staring number 3 in less than two weeks (and I work).  I have read other books from this author - notably the Wild Cards series for over 20 years.  I stayed away from these books because I am not keen on fantasy.  However these are an excellent read with a well crafted world and a story line with a wealth of characters.  I also bought the fifth book and I will wait eagerly for the last 2 to come out.
0312330537|5.0|This book hands down is one of the best books i have ever read. Its truly a classic read, a marvel. The author has done a fantastic job at depicting his personal story and adding fictional characters to keep the readers glued to the book the entire time. Once you pick up this book, you have to read it in its entirety before putting it down. The story is thrilling and captivating and the characters are memorable. The author engages the reader with the story as well as the characters. I highly recommend this book.
0786889284|5.0|Starts off with a bang and keeps the suspense going all the way through! Unexpected twists make this story a great read, and I'm a person who can usually figure out who dunnit within the first couple of chapters.

Rather I tend to look around and find hard cover either in used book stores or half price stores a year or two after the original publish date.  I was lucky to find this first book in his series and found it to be very good.  It is typical Jack Reacher at his best.  He has just left the Army and has his first encounter as a civilian that requires his training as an ex-MP.  Anyone who enjoys the Jack Reacher series will enjoy this book.

B000N0W9WO|5.0|This has to be one the best movies I have seen in a long time. Now, at first I wasn't entirely sure what to make of this, but I was surprised to say the least.    This is one of the greatest feel good films I have come across in a long time. The film boasts some of the greatest talent from both sides of the pond as Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Kate Winslet and Jack black take on the undersigning character roles. The story is beautifully written with clever, quirky dialogue, and even though it is a story that has been dealt with a million times over it still feels fresh and has you wanting more.     This film will make laugh, will make you cry, will make you feel happy and it will make you feel sad. It will make you feel frustrated beyond words and it will fill you heart with warmth and ebbing love.     This film should be watched by everyone at least once! Me, I have it in my collection. It's a film that can be enjoyed with a partner or on your own. And when the credits rolled at the end I felt totally satisfied. Tremendous!!
B003Y5H5C4|3.0|THIS DOES CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS<br /><br />Ruben Fleischer's first directorial effort, Zombieland, was met with both critic acclaim and fan appraisal. There seem to be far fewer people who disliked Zombieland compared to those who enjoyed it. Zombieland was quite entertaining though; its cast was incredibly well-rounded, it offered a new spin on a story we've seen dozens of times before, and most of all it offered humor and sharp wit during what is otherwise the end of the world; a time when you least expected it. Zombieland was something special. However, 30 Minutes or Less seems like a completely different type of comedy. The trailers lead you to believe it could go either way; one way being extremely hilarious and the other ending with you kicking yourself because you didn't just wait to rent it. Even after seeing the movie, 30 Minutes or Less still manages to fall somewhere in the middle of that generalization.<br /><br />30 Minutes or Less starts off pretty strong. The dialogue is really funny, you can feel the chemistry between the actors, and the storyline is progressing at a steady pace. It seems like it's on track to be this fantastically amusing R-rated comedy that's one of the funniest films of the year, but it begins to lose steam after the bank robbery. It's like the humor begins to lose its wit and becomes more about bickering between the duos Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) and Chet (Aziz Ansari) and Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson). By the end of the movie, you'll wonder how a pizza deliveryman who does nothing but smoke pot, drink, play video games, and watch action movies who's never amounted to anything his entire life can rob a bank, get away with it, and be as smart as he is about the entire situation. Is it years of untapped potential finally bubbling to the surface or a giant plot hole? You'll have to be the judge of that.<br /><br />There seems to be a plethora of plot devices added in the second half of the movie that hurts it overall. A pen gun, a hired gun getting his own side story, a romance, the potential tan salon Dwayne and Travis won't stop talking about, police chases, the leverage changing hands several times, and flamethrowers all entering the picture, it all becomes too much to process. Trying to juggle that many scenes only results in a movie like this stumbling in its attempted execution.<br /><br />The cast is 30 Minutes or Less finest asset. The writing certainly has its moments, but the actors are what make the movie as entertaining as it is. Jesse Eisenberg portrays that same sharp wit you've come to expect from the actor. Meanwhile Danny McBride gives one of his best performances. McBride tends to be utilized so well as a supporting character. All of his qualities seem to shine brightest when he's not the main character. It's one of the reasons Your Highness didn't work out. Nick Swardson plays up the bomb expert/second fiddle to Dwayne role incredibly well. He's more intelligent than he lets on and the scene where he's unleashing his kicks in front of a tied up and bomb straddled Nick is probably his funniest in the movie. Last but not least, there's Michael Pe&ntilde;a who's the one character in the movie who can get laughs just by the way he talks alone. His \\"pimp\\" scene in the mirror is quite amusing. You may have noticed I left out Aziz Ansari and that's mostly because it felt like he wasn't very funny at all. He had a few one-liners that are snicker-worthy, but seemed to ruin it by running it into the ground and just overdoing it in general.<br /><br />The other disheartening thing about 30 Minutes or Less is the way it ends. It doesn't feel like a conclusion since everything just kind of stops. The movie ends with a laugh and has a pretty ridiculous scene after the credits, but it leaves so many unanswered questions. It was probably left open for a possible sequel, which would probably just completely ruin what limited appeal this comedy has.<br /><br />30 Minutes or Less is fast paced, action packed, and even downright hilarious at times. Unfortunately, it doesn't keep up the momentum it first starts off with. The humor becomes stale, the actors tend to get caught up in being silly rather than moving the story along, and action takes a front seat in the second half while the comedy takes a hit, but 30 Minutes or Less is still fairly amusing and at least worth a rental in the long run.ilarious at times.

0425241505|3.0|I've seen practically nothing but rave reviews for Dragon Bound by Thea Harrison, so I'm sorry to say that I was a little underwhelmed. I didn't hate it, and certain parts of it were fantastic, but I have enough complaints that I'm going to have to label it as average.<br /><br />The book opens with Pia, our heroine, escaping after stealing an item from Dragos' lair. This feat was supposed to have been impossible, but Pia has some hidden talents--and furthermore, she was threatened and blackmailed into the act. Dragos is beyond pissed at the insult of being robbed, and pursues Pia as she flees into the territory of his enemies. To say more would give too much away, so I'll just say that with Dragos being the leader of the Wyrs (shapeshifters, I guess), he has some pretty nasty enemies.<br /><br />I'm going to start with the world building, because the concept of a book containing dragons, elves, and fairies as main characters is what drew me to this book in the first place. Books with such a variety of supernatural creatures and concepts often suffer from info dump and exposition overload. Thankfully, this one wasn't too bad--the author keeps it simple. I actually wished for a little more information at certain times--some clarification on the distinctions between fae and elf and so on, for example. But overall, the world building is pretty solid.<br /><br />That said, there isn't anything spectacularly innovative going on in this book. It follows a lot of the traditional patterns you'll see in paranormal romance, and uses many familiar tropes. If you swapped out the dragon and other mythological creatures for vampires and werewolves, every reviewer would be calling this a boring cliched flop. And the thing is, you really could make that swap without damaging the plot too much.<br /><br />Let's take Dragos as an example. Initially I was impressed by the fact that he acted so much like the mythological dragon I hoped for. He's acquisitive and possessive, violent and uncivilized, a leader but a loner, and of course ancient and immortal. But other than the actual turning into a dragon, the above traits are ones I'm used to seeing in the vamps and werewolf alphas of other books. He just isn't unique in my mind. He's a nifty concept, but his personality is underdeveloped and unoriginal. As a result, I never fully connected with him.<br /><br />Then there's Pia. I liked Pia, because she seemed to act, and react to events, much the way I would expect a rational person to. She isn't too perfect, she has plenty of  moments where she freaks out. She makes some bad decisions, but still demonstrates competence. Throughout most of the book, it's a mystery as to what Pia actually is. The payoff is not disappointing.<br /><br />The timeline of the book spans a little over a week. That's a pretty short time for two people to fall in love and commit to one another. That leads me into my biggest issue with this book. I'm just going to say it, SPOILER though it is...this is a fated mate book. The relationship is destined to be, no point fighting it, don't know if they could live without one another, etc. The mate bond (in this book) is pretty much entirely used as a substitute for a real emotional connection, a contrived way of putting two people together who would probably not commit to one another otherwise. The sex scenes were sensual and intense, so I believed that Pia and Dragos have the hots for one another. And yes, I guess I believe they're bonded as mates because the book tells me so. But I'm not satisfied that they feel real, absolute love. I'm not even satisfied that they know each other very well. This book felt like the prelude to a real love story, not the love story itself.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not hugely disappointed in this book. I would probably read the next book in the series if I came across it. I just feel pretty neutral toward this one. 2.5 stars.r, and of course ancient and immortal.

B002ZG98C8|5.0|I wanted badly to enjoy this film, because the tailer is so great and because Danny Trujo has deserved a starring role in a film for such a very long, long time... but the plot was just too hammy. Best scene was when Machete was making out in the pool with the topless wife and daughter of his adversary. Too many meatheads in this film, in particular the racist homicidal maniac senator (typical, typical) played by Robert \\"who believes he will ever be in a good movie again\\" DeNiro. Danny Trujo is good in the film, although they give him too little dialogue - the \\"strong silent type\\" thing doesn't work forever. Jessica Alba nearly ruins the movie with her stupid participation, and Michelle Rodriguez doesn't really spice it up much except as eye candy.  Looking forward to Machete Kills and Machete Kills again - I just KNOW that they can do better.
B003UESJF6|5.0|Although thoroughly unimpressed by the marketing for this movie, I caught it on Netflix and fell in love with it. I bought it that week. The characters are well-rounded and enjoyable, the story is thoughtful and heartfelt, and the animation is superb.    This is one of the few movies that I can enjoy over and over, which works well because my daughter absolutely loves it.  She enjoys the rock music and action scenes (which I also like), while I get to watch a fun, subtle movie with characters with understandable motivations and smart humor mixed in with jokes she can understand.    I'm really hoping Dreamworks will expand this franchise.  It's too wonderful a movie to fall into obscurity.
B004ZGI1V0|1.0|Totally retarded, \\"I've got amnesia, people are out to kill me, who am I and how can I stop this insidious plot that I'm starting to unravel\\" type of a film. Incorporates elements of the Bourne trilogy, Memento, Salt, some of those stupid Tom Cruise movies, etc. Dumb dumb dumb.
1451629184|5.0|I have not yet finished this book but it is very good!  Amazing what this girl was able to endure!  She is such a special person for being able to keep her cool in such an awful situation and for such a long time!  The book is quite an eye opener as to just exactly what she had to endure.
B001H5X7I4|3.0|A lot of people thought this was a great film, I thought it was so-so. The screenplay is very clever the way it makes fun of Hollywood while bringing all of its plot elements full circle, including Ben Stiller's heart-warming flop about a mentally challenged man called \\"Simple Jack\\". Every actor is merely being unoriginal by aping something in Hollywood (\\"Simple Jack\\" makes fun of Sean Penn's \\"I Am Sam\\", for example, while Ben Stiller otherwise apes Bruce Willis, Robert Downey Jr parodies Russel Crowe, Jack Black tastelessly mimics Chris Farley, etc). Probably the most enjoyable actor is Brandon T Jackson, someone I only know from that awful Percy Jackson film; as the only black actor in the movie, the scenes where he makes fun of Robert Downey Jr's fakeness as an Australian actor with an American accent pretending to be a black man are pretty hilarious.<br /><br />Tom Cruise has been lauded for playing Les Grossman, a truly evil studio executive. I'm not as impressed, since the idea of seeing a scabby fat suit and balding man make-up applied to the toned abs and creamy complexion of Jedi Master Cruise billows waaaaaay beyond irony and well into stupidity (his hairy fat hands are particularly icky). In his delivery Cruise is just imitating Samuel Jackson, Al Pacino and Harvey Keitel in a terribly unbelievable way, and with his fat suit how different is he from Martin Lawrence in Big Mama's House, Eddie Murphy in the Nutty Professor, John Travolta in Hairspray, or AC/DC's Rosie prop? Les Grossman - so what. Apparently he's going to get his own movie. Great, more fat suits in feature films...<br /><br />Of course, the fake trailers are what keeps everybody talking about the film, and they're pretty okay, although they're nowhere near as good as those in Grindhouse (Don't, don't don't don't DON'T!). \\"Satan's Alley\\" is so-so, as it reunites Robert Downey Jr and Tobey Maguire for a re-hash of their gay scenes in The Wonder Boys. The movie also has quite a few funny things about it, such as the way they created a website for the energy drink that the rapper character Alpa-China (played by Jackson - love the name) flogs called Booty Sweat. Hit the link and try the Booty Sweat challenge, man! Also check out his great site.  The Tropic Thunder site is pretty good too.<br /><br />The title to the review is meant to be ironic, by the way...as the way they created a website for the energy drink that the rapper character Alpa-China (played by Jackson - love the name) flogs called Booty Sweat.

0425241505|5.0|I was actually in the bookstore passing Dragon Bound by, so what is the world was I thinking.  The book itself is so much better than the description which seems ho-hum.  Full of deep character and world building, hot and steamy sexual Alpha Males Love Making/Taking scenes, a deep and wonderful plot and cast of characters, I plunged into it and then Storms Heart and am eagerly awaiting Serpents Kiss.  I wish this world was reality where Wyr Elder Races lived alongside humans enhancing their world.  Each Race has internal intrigue and its up to the Dragon Race to help keep the peace and see justice done.  What an HBO series this would make.  Thea Harrison is right up there with my faves, Adrian, Slade, Cole and Knight.  Better in some respects to.  Riveting.
0895260131|1.0|I am not a politically correct, multiculturalist left-winger, but I also do not like demagoguery of any kind. I want facts and this book does not deliver.<br /><br />I wanted to learn more about Islam by reading a book that is a bit edgy, i.e. not the liberal politically correct kind that thinks everything is just great with Islam. We see radicalisation of Muslims in many countries, including traditionally moderate Malaysia and Indonesia. There are problems in Islam regarding tolerance for other religions, conversion to other religions, and other things. I wanted a serious book highlighting these issues. I also realise that not all is bad. Go to Istanbul in Turkey and you will hardly find any woman who covers her face, except Saudi-Arabian tourists. There is such a thing as moderate Islam and I wanted to understand that too.<br /><br />This book sure is edgy, but also useless. The author states a lot of things, but we get no information about whether this is the author's own interpretation or standard interpretation in sunni, shia, or both types of Islam. Mixing facts and opinions is just making Islam look innocent and the author stupid. I would have expected the author to pick topics that would make Islam look questionable, but he goes further. Almost on every page he makes it clear that Islam is garbage and Christianity is great. Why not let the facts speak for themselves instead? Even the crusades consisted of good Christians against bad Muslims according to the author. I don't need this diatribe. The crusaders also attacked Christian Constantinople (Istanbul) and sacked the greatest church Haghia Sophia. Why isn't this discussed? The fact is that the world is not as black and white as the author thinks.<br /><br />So I don't like this book at all because I want to make up my mind without anyone preaching to me. Please just give me FACTS including how prominent scholars have interpreted those facts.<br /><br />Wikipedia tells us the author was a COMMUNIST in his youth. I am certainly not going to start to trust a communist, whether current or former. Extremists like that tend to be both confrontational and preachy whatever they believe in. For saying this I am sure that this review will get much negative feedback by the mindless people who follow the author without thinking.<br /><br />I would advice anyone to just read wikipedia articles instead. Then look at al-quran.info for various translations of the Koran. Quite interesting. It also turns out that what most Muslims believe is not in the Koran. Instead there are loads of additional books written 100-200 year after Mohammed died. This is interesting, but the author has no time for this level of description.youth.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app. I was looking for one app that allows for making notes and checklists and found exactly what I was looking for. I can set reminders and post notes to my home page for easy access. The only thing I don&apos;t like is that I cannot change the reminder alert ringtone.
B003XWEQ1G|1.0|It was challenging to believe this was the same great team that brought us the dynamic and powerful Gladiator.  The movie was dark, dreary, and so all other the place that you never knew where you were in the film even though they identified the locale.  Too many war scenes, too many bad guys that weren't given enough time to be really bad, no humor, no lightness, uneven script, and worse direction, and for the first time ever, I didn't enjoy Russell Crowe.
B0051BVQFG|1.0|This movie was garbage! This new generation think that so long as a movie has consecutive explosions, shootings, a cute girl (yeah, I like Michelle R.) and a bunch of dumb macho male leads you can give a movie 5 stars?! Pssssssttt! Wrong!! The plot was weak, the writing was weak, the \\"acting\\" was weak, did they even consult with real Marines, before making this movie. I want my money back!

There are many lessons of life in this book.  Our children are precious gifts.  I can't even speak about the two monsters that took Jaycee's childhood. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested.  It wasn't gross in details, but definitely told her story.

B003Y74AXO|3.0|I gave this product three stars because I suppose it does protect the screen, which is what its supposed to do, plus the cleaning cloth works, however, the protector doesn't apply well.  The screen protector is difficult to apply cleanly and smoothly; its almost as if one needs a professional application of the film.  Bubbles are the end result and I don't think most people would be content to just ignore them on the screen:  they are annoying.  So, I suppose it the product could be worse, but I'm sure it could also be better.  I'd take my chances and try another brand.
B004LWZVZC|2.0|Here's a piece of history that's prime for the big screen.  'The Conspirator' offers a lot of promise, but this is a Robert Redford film afterall so why not have a little politicising with your movie enjoyment?  The truth is 'The Conspirator' isn't as heavy-handed as 'Lions for Lambs', but making connections to current events are none to subtle either.  The prisoners wear hoods in their jail cells (Guantanamo anyone?), while Kevin Kline's Secretary of War looks suspiciously (or not so much) like Donald Rumsfeld with a beard.  Oh well, if you can make it past the politics it's a fairly engaging story concentrating mostly on the trial of Mary Suratt while the actual assassination of President Lincoln is given about 10 minutes at the start of the film.    Production-wise the film looks pretty good, although I did feel at times I was watching an A&E dramatized documentary than an actual Hollywood movie.  The sets and costumes look fantastic.  And although I didn't particularly care for it, the decision to film using a soft, but washed-out style does give the film a certain rustic feel perfect for the movie's setting.  As far as the acting goes, Robin Wright is a standout in the role of Mary Suratt.  And it was good to see Stephen Root in a supporting role.  But James McAvoy who is a very fine actor was entirely miscast.  He delivers his lines with zero conviction -- perhaps concentrating more on his American accent than the emotion of his dialogue.     Although 'The Conspirator' isn't a must-see, it's a serviceable movie about a certain piece of forgotten history.  Even those cautious about Redford's name attached should be able to get away with only a few eye-rolls.  But ya know, sometimes you just want to watch a movie about a piece of history without all the politicising.

B00005JLEX|5.0|There's much more to appreciate about the first two seasons of Seinfeld in retrospect.  The show didn't get much acclaim in its infancy, but later success allowed the staff to become much bolder with ideas and characters.  But looking back on the episodes now, it's impressive how early on Seinfeld himself had realized the personalities of George, Elaine, and Kramer, as well as the show's niche of being about \\"nothing.\\"  For audiences seeing the first episodes back in 1989, it was funny, but a bit confusing.  The show's star was also the show's main character, who happened to be a comedian (both in real life and on the show), with snippets of his stand-up loosely connecting seemingly random events in his life.  His three best friends are his ex-girlfriend, a hyperactive neurotic, and a one-named shut-in (it took a few more episodes for Kramer to evolve than the other characters).  A lot of people just didn't get it yet.  So even though the writing did strengthen later (as a direct result of being able to take more liberties thanks to the show's building momentum) the early episodes have some hilarious moments and are great fun to look back on now knowing all of the characters much better.  Favorites include The Stake Out, The Robbery, The Pony Remark, The Busboy, The Baby Shower, The Jacket, The Chinese Restaurant, The Phone Message, The Apartment, The Stranded, The Statue, The Heart Attack, The Revenge, and The Deal.  So that's 14 of the 18 total Season One and Two episodes that I count as favorites, so needless to say, I think this is five stars, even though not quite as strong a five as the later seasons.  Additionally, the special features make all of the Seinfeld sets better than most shows.  Hours and hours of commentaries, documentaries, outtakes, commercials...just about everything a fan could think of that they'd want to see is here.  This is a good start to what became a legendary sitcom.
0060723513|2.0|About halfway through, I reread Marlo Morgan's introduction.  Having done so, I pondered the photo reproduced on the back cover.  Now I'm asking:  if a person has learned the \\"truths\\" she claims to have learned, why would that person continue to color her hair and enhance (?) her appearance with makeup.      I do like the suggestion to \\"spit out\\" what seems irrelevant.  You may want to spit out the book as a whole because it probably is not really based on actual experience.  Or you may choose to use it as food for thought.    My suggestion:  before you spend $$ and psychic energy on this book, check it out by googling \\"Marlo Morgan\\" and then make up your own mind.
0439023521|1.0|I hated this book although I couldn't stop reading the series until I saw an end of the capital and its evils. The behavior of the capital is not realistic since considering many different cultures today practically all of the wealthy (GDP per capita) ones tend to be more sympathetic of people suffering and in bad conditions. This is true for non-democracies and even totalitarian governments, even China have been slowly increasing its efforts to improve the quality of life of its population although with a GDP per capita of 3k China would not really be classified as one of the highest GDP's per capita in the world. So it's sick to see that the people in the capital don't care at all about the violence or need that goes on in the hunger games. This, along with what was said in other reviews, made me decide that this  book is not a worthwhile read unless you think your life sucks and that it can't get any worse. In this case this book would you make you feel better about your life otherwise don't make yourself feel like garbage for no reason.

1451629184|5.0|Jaycee Duggard is just an amazing woman!This book is written in her own voice. I'm sure she's gotten a lot of therapy since she was saved from her 18-year long nightmare, but she seems to be making a lot of progress towards a normal life with her mom, sister and daughters.As she points out, she has a 5th grade education and in some places she sound like the little girl she was when she was stolen. In other places she sounds very matter-of-fact and even philosophical about parts of her ordeal.She can never get the 18 years back, yet she seems ready to move forward with the rest of her life. Her book is a combination of heartbreaking and heartwarming.

B002T9H2ME|5.0|Unfortunately, Science Fiction cinema, and literature have always had a somewhat difficult relationship. The literature has always been a rich field of ideas and thought experiments of every shape, but the cinematic forms tended towards the schlocky and gimmicky, with a few notable exceptions. In the literary world of speculative fiction, in which thousands upon thousands of short stories and novels have explored virtually every possible scenario in potential and alternative futures for humans and other types of creatures, there is a vast library of tropes that are commonly interwoven time and again in different configurations as a kind of exploration of the realm of possibility. Yet rarely has this been the case with cinematic Science Ficton. This film, however, happens to resemble the literary tradition more than the cinematic norms. There are no chases, and there is only one fight. But they do take a couple of very common tropes of speculative fiction and explore them in a very evocative and lyrical way--and in the process, ask some very profound questions about the nature of human rights, the social contract, community, competition, and collaboration; the nature of corporate labor, freedom, and the kind of complex problems that might go along with the ability to clone humans the way we clone apple trees.What happens when you reduce the meaning of a human being to the work they are capable of doing, or the job that needs to be done? What of their dreams? Their longings? Their hopes? Does any corporation care about the anxieties of their workers??? What about the customers of those corporations? Like you. Like me. Do you care about the hopes of the Chinese laborers who probably built the parts to the computer you are now staring at? Do you care about their safety? Their dormitory conditions--or their separation from loved ones? I'm not sure why we should--except that it makes me squeamish to think my purchasing power supports a system of slave labor and environment degradation that circles the globe.    I won't say much more, but, even though there is very little that is strictly original here--in literary speculative fiction there is literally nothing new under the sun--nothing that has not been thought of before--and probably 60 years ago at that--however, they do acknowledge their indebtedness to to certain traditions in a playful and respectful fashion. Also, kudos to both the set design and the cinematography, which were very authentic feeling and believable. Every work of science fiction can unravel if you tug at any of the threads too hard--you almost always have to accept a few basic premises--but, having done that, the story should hold together consistently and logically within that framework--and Moon does that, to a surprising degree, considering how often cinematic science fiction disappoints. This film deserves to be more widely known and is worthy of praise from even the most die-hard critic of speculative fiction.  I would have loved to see what Harlan Ellison would have had to say about Moon back when he was still reviewing films for the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. It rekindles my hope that maybe someday film makers will become educated enough to begin harvesting the nearly infinite fields of plenty that literary science fiction has ripened during the past 70 years. There is no excuse for any more ignorant schlock ever again. This is an example of how it can be done, folks.
0545259088|5.0|I loved it and I'm so sad it's over! The story wraps up nicely but Maggie has a way of writing that leaves you wanting just a little more! I forgot how much she makes the character's feelings resonant so deeply inside of you (it has been a year since Linger). I loved Sam and Grace in this book. The care and understanding they had between them in Shiver is back in this book. I loved Linger as well, but at times I wanted to smack Sam upside the head and tell him: Wake up! Look at what's happening to Grace! I guess I have a little of Isabel in me.    I loved Cole and Isabel in this book. I think they were my favorite part of Linger. I would love to hear more of their story in the future. Are you listening Maggie?    I recently watched an interview with Maggie where she says that she would like her books to be the kind where you keep thinking of them long after reading. I have to say congratulations, you did it!

Some of the best parts include: (spoiler alert) the Great White Shark catching seals in 'Shallow Seas', the gigantic pile of bat dung, crawling with roaches, in 'Caves', the amazing ant-killing fungus in 'Jungle', and the falling baby Mandarin Ducks in 'Seasonal Forests'. amazing!
1602728631|4.0|I rarely do reviews. Generally I can't be bothered. But the fact that I'm making an exception with this book should tell you something.    I cheated somewhat with the story itself: I found the synopsis on an old writer-agent website, and after reading it, I thought to myself, \\"Holy crap, I really want to read that story.\\" So I came to amazon and ordered it ($15?! Really?!), having no idea what I was going to get in return to my hard earned money.    There are only two reasons why I didn't give this story 5 stars: the crappy writing at the beginning and the odd purple prose every now and again. When I first began reading the story, I really believed that the book I had taken a chance on had turned out to be a lemon. But I kept reading, and once I got past the first 15 pages or so, Draven finally found the story's rhythm, and I was sucked in. And I mean, SUCKED IN, because I probably had half a dozen other things that needed to get done around the house and for University and I did none of them. Damn you Grace! ( I mean that nicely. :)  ) The odd sentence of purple prose would crop up every now and again, ruining the pace and imagery, but overall, the writing was good enough to be invisible, so you can focus on the characters and the story itself.    I loved Silhara, but I think Gurn was the favourite. It took a little while for Martise to grow on me. Draven does an absolutely superb job on her characterisations, giving real depth and dimension to them. I thought the world she set things in a little blah: there wasn't nearly as much focus on the world-building as there should have been; I think that would have cleared up some confusion as well as make the story more vivid. And she left a few hints in the story of a further backstory, but never mentions of elaborates on it. I found that annoying. Either tell me about it in the story, or leave it out altogether. But that's just me.    Some of my favourite scenes in the book include when Martise is 'singing' and when Silhara reconsiders his time with Anya. They were truly laugh out loud funny, I couldn't stop giggling. Give it a read and you'll see what I mean.    Genuinely a story I can read again and again, which is the whole point of buying books, really. If you want to curl up with a sexy romance novel with a dangerous anti-hero, I recommend this one.
0312427999|5.0|This will not be long.  \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" is one of the most critically important publications of the last decade.  In it Ms.Klein exposes how Capitalism & Capitalists (mainly in the U.S.) create events that destabilize other populations in order to install extreme neoliberal economic policies in countries around the world (much as the contrived \\"debt crisis\\" is being used to install extreme neoliberal policies in the U.S.).  Once you understand the pattern she describes in unerring detail, you'll find many examples her book doesn't have room to explore.    A real eye-opener and a 'must-read' for those interested in understanding the machinations of the Empire.

0385340990|3.0|I don't like chick lit and that style of writing. Additionally when a story is told in letters, it's only interesting to me if two people communicate. When you have more than two as this book, you have to read the same thing over. This really should have been cleaned up into a short story.<br />I liked learning about the Channel islands and the nazi occupation and I did like reading that some of the Nazi's were young men who had no choice but didn't go along with the idealogy.<br />Everyone seems to like this book, I thought at it's finest it was OK. So sorry I paid money for it.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|I rarely purchase tv series on DVD.......this is the best written,most creative, dark,fantastically human,amazingly addictive television show I've seen since well forever.....My boyfriend rented season 1 for me to watch and we watched it together I was hooked 15 minutes into the first episode. We then went and rented season 2 finished both in one weekend each. Then Season 3 getting ready to come out in video store and I couldn't stand it so I went to the local big box retailer and purchased season three......if one and two don't blow your mind season three well...... lets just say I didn't think the writing or the acting could maintain or for that matter get any better and damn I was wrong........fantastic. I am so addicted I went ahead and purchased from Amazon Season 1 & 2. I am into the 4th season on TV and can't wait wait wait for Season 4 on DVD. Best ever tv show! A must see for all . Even if you are not a tv series person.....you won't be able to stop......I bet someone will have to come up with a Breaking Bad detox program when this show stops......Just when you think you've seen the best and the worst in all the characters......BAM! Something else reaches out of the TV and grabs your brain and forces your eyes to pop out and your mouth to drop to the floor.....  Start from the beginning though so you can watch the characters change and evolve and come into their own........outfrickinstanding!!!!!!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I am not very technically minded so after I figured out how to use it, I uploaded 150 children's songs from the computer to my phone without cables.  Then I pressed the Menu button on the app to exit.  We will see how it works when I get ready to play the songs.  If all goes well, I can definitely see this app coming in very handy in the future not only for transferring songs, but pictures too.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I've had this watch for about a week now, and I love it! There is something so pleasant about having a watch that does not require batteries and depends on your movements to sustain it. I am very pleased with this purchase    Style: I really like the black face with white numbers. The fact that the minute markers receive larger billing than the hour markers gives the watch a fairly unique look. I have no issues with the size of the watch- the comparison to a standard Ironman digital is close (this watch is a little more substantial). It does not look small on the wrist to me. The red tipped second hand is also a nice touch. The case is brushed metal, which may make this a slightly less upscale watch, but it certainly does not look cheap.     As others have eluded to, the fabric band is not ideal. I plan on getting a metal bracelet to dress it up a bit. However, if your preference is for the watch to look more utilitarian (especially with some of the colors) then the fabric/synthetic band should do just fine.     Functionality/Accuracy: Time/date is easy enough to set with a 3 position crown. As for the water resistance, w/o a screw down crown, I wouldn't want to shower or swim with this watch, just to be on the safe side. So far, it's running about 4-8 seconds fast per day, which is certainly acceptable for day to day use. Aside from the band, the other subpar element is the luminescent material on the hands. It does not last more than 10-15 minutes before it fades away in the dark. Other than that, it seems well made and I've very happy with the purchase. With some shopping around, one shouldn't have to pay more than $45-$55 dollars for a great automatic.
0553801473|5.0|The negative reviews citing a slow pace as the reason for the negativity annoy me for three reasons.<br /><br />1.) This book was specifically billed by the author (years in advance) as running parallel to the previous one in the series.  The fact that this was mostly true should be no surprise.<br /><br />2.) This is an immensely complex story with many interwoven plot lines.  It still is and should be no surprise.<br /><br />3.) A running theme in the story so far is that characters tend to see their plans destroyed.  The fact that some characters do not get to the places they'd (or you'd) like to see them as quickly as they'd (or you'd) prefer should be no surprise.<br /><br />This book is a page-turner.  It is a continuation of a series already several thousand pages long.  I found the negative reviews due to a seemingly too-slop plot-development schedule to be as numerous as they are baseless.<br /><br />Further, Sanderson has done a largely solid job with the Jordan series.  I just don't think he'll be needed to finish this enterprise.<br /><br />If you wanted a shorter story, you should have picked a series with fewer pages in each book.  There are some good ones.  I recommend Zelazny's \\"Chronicles of Amber,\\" Tolkien's \\"[what was the name of that series...],\\" or Moon's \\"Vatta's War\\"  Or if you'd like a wonderful book that vomits up a rushed ending just to get it done, I recommend Stephenson's \\"Cryptonomicon.\\"<br /><br />Those are some great books.  I prefer Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire.\\"

B004KPLVW2|5.0|For many, the FX and story will seem so out of date.  But, you've got to approach this with the mind and eyes of the beginning of the computer age in 1982.  Put into that context, the audacity of TRON is just amazing.  No one had ever seen a movie about \\"users\\", \\"programs\\", \\"bits\\", and the \\"MCP\\".  Few were even aquainted with the terms.  Add the that the absolutely fantastic use of back-lit animation, and you have a completely unique film.  So many of the ideas in TRON came into everyday usage with the power of personnal computing.  And the thought of a \\"Master Control Program\\" taking over has become the fodder for many stories.  The blu-ray contains new special features as well as the original \\"making of ... \\" documentary.  It still amazing to think that TRON is considered such a major step into computer animation, when most of it was done by hand rather than in a computer.  It's also amazing to understand that TRON was the real beginning of Disney computer animation that is used so much today, and was also the impetus for Pixar.  If you enjoy the original STAR WARS, in it's 1977 state-of-the-art FX, then you'll love TRON.  Head back to 1982 and the beginnings of the computer age.

I was so grateful for all the good information she included.  I would recommend this book to everyone who has had a stroke or been the caregiver of a stroke victim.  It's also full of information on how the brain works.  Excellent and loaded with insight!

0446348244|4.0|This is one of the shorter P.D. James books that I have read and, as usual, I enjoyed it. The author spent the first third of the book introducing the characters and giving us an idea of the things they had in common and why they were living at the Grange together. In the next part of the book, he introducted story lines and finally got around to the Black Tower. The Tower itself was a fine representative of evil and death. Various murders happened along the way to keep the readers's interest up. The reader knows they are related, but has no idea why unless he is a frequent reader of Jame's novels.(I have now read three of them.) I was still trying to figure out how all the pieces of information fit together and the book was coming to an end. As has happened in previous James novels, Inspector Dagiliesh suddenly has a moment of serendipity and solves the mystery. Now that I have read three of these novels and see that this seems to be how the author resolves all his mysteries, I can now begin to collect the clues in a better fashion myself and hope that I will soon see a plausible end to the next book, or books, that I read. Once one has learned to step into the Detective's character, I think the end of the books will be more foreseeable. I hope to become a sleuth of sorts by reading these. They are fun and the first of this genre that I have read in many a year.<br />They are set in England and this one was set in the 1980's. So life is certainly prim and proper as one would expect the cool Brits to be. I enjoy these just because they are a change from the American fast paced \\"kill as many as possible in the most horrid way possible\\" books which are set in current times. Of course, the Americans were always a bit more rough and tumble than their British compatriots.<br />The author also always throws in a bit of British history and takes time to make you feel like you are standing on the moors themselves. The only thing I do not care for in her writing style is her overuse of adverbs and adjectives. Plus, she purposely uses some very Olde words that one might look up from time to time. But, overall, it is a great way to spend the time prior to sleeping or a quiet afternoon.of adverbs and adjectives.

B0041KKYEW|5.0|I've yet to watch the movie itself, but that's due to an error on my part.  Inadvertently I ordered this movie on Blu-ray.

A big thanks to the \\"MOVIEMATTMAN\\".
B004EPZ08O|4.0|This has proven to be a great year for the 5th entry in movie series (i.e. Fast Five, X-Men: First Class). For fans of the series, or horror buffs in general, I couldn't recomend this film any more. It is suprising, suspenseful and the first film in a long time to make me cringe for fear of what was to happen next. The acting is top notch. Not oscar material, but certainly good enough to believe the characters and actually care for them. I'm not going to spoil the insane murder scenes or the even crazier twist, but as a person who 9 times out of 10 hates 3D, this film must be viewed in 3D. It was shot in 3D, and is used very affectively and brutally. They finally find a way to cheat death with help from the return of the great Tony Todd. Over all, it was a great time at the movies and the best sequel in the series, plus it has the greatest death scene in the series from the girl during the gymnastic sequence. Ouchhh! Great Brutal Fun!

Even Jon disappoints (except for the part with Janos Slynt), and Tyrion, his chapters are so booooring... He used to be so brilliantly witty. Sad to say but I had to skip paragraphs, sometimes whole pages to get to the end. It would have been more exciting to kill off some poor bastards and make room for new ones. If another volume  doesn't bring a huge storm  I'm done with Martin. Send him to the Wall, I say.

7119024086|5.0|It's a story of a battle of wits. Military battles are won with trickery and deception, not just with sheer brute force, although force is essential of course. Same is true with diplomacy and politics. In a way it's all like playing chess, and what is chess if not a battle of wits?<br /><br />The author adopts a style similar to that of ancient Chinese historical records, it's historical fiction after all, with 70% history and 30% fiction. And it's written centuries ago. Therefore it's very different from western novels. Everything is concise, succinct, and to the point. The pacing is lightening fast, and doesn't stop. Don't expect it to burst into a lengthy description of a scenery or somebody's appearance or anything really. Most of the time the reader has to imagine for themselves what everything looks like. If it does touch on a character's appearance, you can bet that character is important later on, which can be difficult to know with the rainstorm of characters introduced.<br /><br />With such a pace and length, you can already imagine that it covers an enormously long and very complicated plot with hundreds of characters. But the author's brilliance makes it all easy to follow. Character development is skillfully woven into the plot. Every personality is unique and often very interesting. A myriad of the bravest, most capable, shrewdest, most intelligent, or most ambitious people dance across the scene. Countless heroes emerge from all over the land and levels of society to fight for dominance after the fall of Han. Fates change constantly and very fast. After power settles into the three kingdoms, the action does not stop. After all, this tells the story of one of the most unstable periods in Chinese history.<br /><br />This is the epic that pales all other epics in comparison. If you have the patience to get used to the style and sort out the multitude of names, this can become a fascinating story.

B004SIP7AS|5.0|I have not read the Jane Austen novel, but I have seen its modern parody \\"Clueless\\".  I am left with the strange feeling that this movie version of a novel published in 1815 depicts a society more like that of my youth in the late 1960's and early 1970's than that of the social world in the 1995 movie \\"Clueless\\".  Gwyneth Paltrow's performance is moving in her depiction of a young woman's romantic hopes and designs--for herself as well as for her friends.  From my own recollections of high school I recognize the efforts of Paltrow's Emma as similar to those of high school girls in my own day.  The lengths that a girl might go to in order to set up her friends with various boys was something that I found truly astonishing in my own high school days forty years ago.  Indeed, a college friend once told me that he ended up with his fiance due to a decision made between her and her girlfriend regarding which of the two of them would go after him!
B001VNB54A|1.0|Band of Brothers was one of the very best made for television mini-series of all time. Superbly written, with fine characterzation and wonderful performances, I can watch it over and over again.     This sludge cashes in on the earlier effort. It was made to make a quick buck. It is a disappointing, spiritless, horrifically written piece of gaudy, effects laden nonsense not worthy of sitting beside that other product which sits on your shelf.    Don't bother.     The series lack coherancy, it has no focus and it possesses bottom of the barrel, trite writing on an epic scale.    The Producers knew it would sell, no matter what, and they concentrated on the special effects and forgot what was acutually important.    Terrible stuff. Hanks and Spielberg really ought to be ashamed of this half-assed effort.    The Pacific is the perfect measure of taste in television. If you listen to the advertising, it's the best thing since American apple pie and milk. If you watch this dully written tripe and think it has substance and belongs on the same planet as Band of Brothers, you probably have black velvet paintings of The Duke in your kitchen and think McDonalds actually sells tasty quality food.

B00005N5RM|5.0|Kevin Dillon (ENTOURAGE), Shawnee Smith (SAW 1-3), Donovan Leitch (GLORY), Jeffrey DeMunn (THE HITCHER), Candy Clark (Q: THE WINGED SERPENT), Paul McCrane (ROBOCOP), Ricky Paull Goldin (ALL MY CHILDREN), Beau Billingslea (JUST JORDAN), Art La Fleur (HOME IMPROVEMENT), Michael Kenworthy (THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD PART II), Bill Moseley (TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2), Del Close (BEWARE! THE BLOB) and Joe Seneca (THE VERDICT) star in Chuck Russell and Frank Darabont's under appreciated 1988 remake of THE BLOB. By the title, I find this remake to be gold. The cast is much more capeable, much more memorable and much more likeable than the original movie's cast. The special effects are the best thing since John Carpenter's THE THING (1982). The movie also has a great sense of humor. There is a funny scene where a jock is going to buy condoms, the reverend shows up and the jock places the blame on his friend, Paul who is also in the pharmacy in the corner. Paul goes on a date later and meets his date's father who was the pharmacist who gave the other jock the condoms. The father says \\"Ribbed!\\" You have to see the movie in order to really laugh at it or watch the great reviews by johnsparadise or trachenburg. The death scenes are superb. My favorites are Paul's, the Chef's, Dr. Meddows's and Deputy Briggs's. The whole movie is great, I even like the last few minutes of the movie despite the filmmakers are never going to make a sequel sadly. If they ever do, I think it should be an apocalyptic sequel with Reverend Meeker as the main villain. Here's my toast to the movie and I give this an infinity out of infinity star rating. I know I always say that but this film deserves it. It definitely deserves to be placed at the top of best horror remakes along with THE THING, THE FLY and THE HILLS HAVE EYES. Those 3 and THE BLOB are my favorite remakes ever made!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I may be biased writing this review, mainly cause Lady Gaga is my absolute favourite artist. But objectively speaking, this album was fabulous! I was waiting for Born This Way for quite a while and did not disappoint! When I first collectively listened through the entire album, it was different, I couldn't tell if it was in a good or bad way. However, after a few listens, it occurred to me that this was just a different side of Gaga. The Fame Monster (my favourite album, although it was an EP) was more of a dark and twisty edge to it. Born This Way, at least to me is more of a celebration of who she is, shown especially in Edge of Glory. To people who believe that these songs are commercial and that Gaga has lost what originally brought her stardom--you're wrong!! Who else but Gaga could have a saxophone interlude in her songs and still have it play on the radio. On behalf of all your fans, thank you Gaga for the happiness you have brought to our ears!

0375701427|4.0|Having never read a novel by Roth (and arriving a little late in the game now that he has 30 novels behind him), I wasn't sure exactly what to expect with this novel, which I read for a book club. Most of my impressions of Roth were formed by what I'd heard about Portnoy's Complaint, the heavy emphasis on sex and Jewish angst, and finally seeing the film of Goodbye, Columbus. What I found, surprisingly, was a very thorough exposition of American experience from pre-World War II to the early 90's, focusing primarily on the crises of the sixties and seventies, particularly as they impact the life of the main character Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov. The story is told by Nathan Zuckerman, Roth's fictional author and alter ego who, aside from briefly reappearing about mid-way into the novel, disappears altogether. In a mode similar to Balzac's depiction of the book publishing industry in Lost Illusions and Melville's treatment of the whaling industry in Moby-Dick, Roth presents an extremely detailed description and background of the glove-making industry in 20th century America. The focal character is a Jewish Golden Boy, Swede Levov, the handsome, universally loved athlete from Jewish Newark, NJ, who had everything going for him and whose stage was set for a perfect, and perfectly successful, life of affluence. Unfortunately, the stage was also set for extreme personal tragedy and disaster in the form of his daughter Merry who, as told almost from the first page, went berserk at sixteen, became a runaway, got herself involved with a terrorist group protesting not only the Vietnam War in early '68 but the entire American way of life as exemplified most completely by her father. The first hundred pages or so, the point is made ad infinitum that this little demon ruined the Swede's life and that of the rest of his family and brought a plague of disaster and nightmare upon her parents. Zuckerman repeats this fact about five times and fifty pages too much before stepping into the background and letting the Swede's life unfold so that we can begin to unravel the mystery of this perfect young Jew, who later becomes a perfect modern Job. Personally, having read and enjoyed many of the long-winded, nineteenth century novels, I did not mind the numerous divergences from the `plot'. However, there are loose ends that are never tied and the last fifty or so pages derail the plot and dilute the impact that had been building progressively. This is a major disappointment considering the power of much of what had preceded it. It's as though Roth were revealing clues in a mystery and then, just as all of the clues were presented, he just got tired of going down that track and backpedaled for the last several pages to reach an oblique and weak conclusion that ends with an overstatement of one of the themes and never resolves what happened on the level of the reality of the characters' lives. This strikes me as an unfinished novel. It is infuriating because it is so powerful in many respects but the first portion could have been tightened as well as many passages throughout the rest of it and a complete conclusion as thorough as the detailed backgrounds of Swede, his wife Dawn and other characters could have been reached without increasing the length of the novel substantially.
1577314808|3.0|First, I have had what felt like a true fight between good and evil for my soul in recent years.  I had wife who insisted on following the mormon religion, which divided my family for years.  My child chose not to follow the mormon beliefs, but in the end the marriage ended.  In the years following my divorce, I was tempted by not one but several women who were willing to give me anything to hang onto me.  They would try to bring other women into our bed and they used sex to tempt and control me.  Things got progressively worse as I would break things off with each woman, only to be tempted by another exactly like her.  The new women would pretend to be Christians, good people, moral people, but in the end, they were just evil.  The severity of each woman's revenge grew in intensity 10 times more than the one before for leaving them.  Ultimately, I was left broken and beaten down.   I have spent the last two years receiving medical treatment and trying to just get back on top of my life again.  I looked to the Power of Now as a way to suppress the pain and move forward.   It seemed to be helping and I found myself buying books for strangers, telling people about it at every turn, both online and in person.       I have been told on multiple occasions that I must be a very important person to have survived the horrible things that were done to me in the fight for good and evil.   I would take this as nearly insulting, because I was a broken man at the lowest point in my life.  It seemed patronizing and made me feel as though I should be outraged that someone would even suggest that the indignities done to me were part of a plan for my life.  Violence was forced upon me with last two women I dated as they tried to see that I paid for not wanting to be with them anymore.  This violence resulted in chronic pain and multiple surgeries to repair the damage.  Of course, these women enlisted the help of new men in their lives to teach me a lesson, because women control menin ways we may never even want to openly admit.      In my attempts to erase the painful memories, I started reading the \\"Power of Now\\".  One night I woke in pain while I was having a vivid dream about good and evil, where I was left with this shocking insight to the possible real motive behind the book.  The author talks about the existence of another entity inside of us as though it is just a common thing.  More than that, it says we should learn to NOT LISTEN TO OUR OWN THOUGHTS, saying that in time we might even eventually laugh at the voice inside our head instead of listening to it.  I thought for a moment about an exorcism movie I had seen where the priests fought to reach the real person, who's body was taken over by a demon.  This had special implications with me, because in the last few years I have had many lapses in time where I had gone to the store in the middle of the night or written emails, etc. that seemed to not even be coming from me.  It was blamed on the head injury that I had received and at other times it was blamed on sleep medications like Ambien and Triazolam.  They called it sleep walking, but the bottom line is that I felt violated every time I woke to a morning after being someone else for a night with no memories at all.  You walk and talk to people as though you are in a zombie state.  I went as far as to give Ambien to one of these women who had taken part in the destruction of my life one night.  She was awake and looking into the camera with dead (possessed looking) eyes, as she proudly told me the real story about dozen of lies she had told me over the years.  She had cheated on many occasions, while launching verbal attacks on me to divert the attention off her.  On the Ambien, this girl told me the truth about everything with a smile on her face.  With the pride of a demon, she would smile as she told me about how hot the other men's orgasms were. She used words that would be as painful as they could be as she mockingly told meall of these stories with very vivid details.  This was not SLEEP WALKING.  It was the act of a evil entity. It was like looking into the face of evil.  I broke all ties with her and later she was launching another attack on me about how delusional I was to believe all of the things I did about her.  I told her that I had a video of her confessing everything in great detail, to which she replied that I was a (cursing) liar and to (cursing) prove it.  I sent her video and she was shocked.  She reacted with such disbelief as she watched the video.  It was her, telling me as harshly as she could ever evil thing she had ever done to me, that she always claimed were just me being delusional when I would question her about where she had been or what she had been doing.   She could only tell me that she didn't know why she said those things, but that maybe she was just screwing with me or something.   I have always believed that this girl had given in years ago to the forces of evil and she claims to be an atheist.  If Ambien could make someone who lived a life full of secrets suddenly look into a camera and boldly tell 20 sex stories in great details that had happened and with no other goal but to see pain on my face as she told me while smiling, then what is the true purpose of meds like Ambien and Triazolam?  Is it all just tools of evil to peck away our soul's ability to be in charge of our body?    I am throwing allot at you at once, but keep reading.      It is my belief that our souls are the entity that is primarily in control of our body, but that there are other entities constantly trying to take over, like in the possession stories.   In the possession stories, some other entity takes over the body at their will, not your will.   The demons kill and abuse others.  When the person wakes later, they have no memory of anything happening.  Anyone who ever took something Ambien and woke to weird things that had been done by them with zero memory or first hand accounts, will see this connection now and (like me) are feeling a chill run up their spines.      The forces of evil are about deception.  They are about manipulation.   What does any of this have to do with the Power of Now book?   We are knowing taking medications that may in fact be allowing these other entities to take over our bodies.  Then I read this book, which is supposed to be about ending suffering.  It says that we must be open it.  It says we should lay down our will and not believe that we are the ones who are supposed to be controlling our bodies.  The book encourages us to \\"stop thinking\\".   It tells us to empty our mind and ignore the voices in our head that are questioning love and life.  It uses words like enlightenment and oneness to shame us or peer pressure us into falling into submission.  The fact that the author openly talks about other entities inside of us is powerful.   It says the only difference between us and a crazy person talking to themselves as they walk down the streets (which we have all seen), is that we have these conversations inside of our head everyday.  They don't keep it inside their heads, but aside from that, we are the same.  He says over and over that they voices are real.  He tells us to ignore the voice that we \\"think is in charge\\" and learn to numb your mind to the point of letting our \\"true identity\\" take over.  Does anyone else see a problem with any of this?    I do not have a great education.  I am communicating this as clearly as I can.  I think I am supposed to tell you all to look at this from from this point of view.  Are we becoming enlightened?  Or are we following instructions to lay down our will and let another entity take over our bodies?   Why don't we remember the things we say or do while on Ambien or other similar medications?  Do they artificially have the same results?   Do they force our true identity to lay down control to another entity?  People have been charged with crimes committed while on thesemedications.  What would a demon do if they could joy ride with your body for a night?  When I first read the book \\"The Power of Now\\", I felt a wisdom that did not seem possible to come from a single man.  When I heard the audio recordings of Eckhart Tolle reciting his book, they sounded like the words of God.  His voice is hypnotizing and anyone who has heard it, will have to admit that.  The immensity of his pure and simple logic was frightening to me on some level, but I read on.  Now, I fear that they are all tools of the forces of evil, trying to get us to lay down our free will.  God gave us free will and I have heard that evil cannot exist anywhere that it was not first invited.  I don't even like to watch Hollywood movies about evil, because that is a form of us inviting evil into our lives.      I don't honestly know my role yet in this fight between good and evil.  I honestly don't even know if I am the good guy or the bad guy yet.   I am just reporting my insights as clearly as I can for you to consider, because I have been moved to do so.  I am honestly fearful that by me going public with this that I will be inviting evil into my life.  I have no intentions except to tell what I have witnessed and the enlightenment that I recently experienced about it all leads me to suspect deception.  Someone told me awhile ago to question books like \\"The Power of Now\\", because even though they talk about the empowering us with true enlightenment, they may ultimately be leading us down a road of deception. These people told me to only trust the Bible and my first reaction was that they were being purist and that anything that leads us to internal peace can only be a good thing.   Now, I fear they may have been right.      There is no doubt we are living in the final days.  200,000 people died in the earthquake of Haiti, thousands more in the tsunami in 2004 that shook the world, the tsunami that claimed the nation of Japan, and so on.  Japan now has a person committing suicide every 15 minutes nationally after the tsunami. Its their number one cause of death nationally since the tsunami hit. Japan continues to be rocked by earthquakes every week, so does the Philippines, New Zealand, The United States, and Europe.  Look up how many volcanoes have erupted world wide in the last year alone.      Look up Supernova info regarding the Red giant star Betelgeuse.  Look up the Great Rift.  Its a black hole in our solar system.  Why do I mention both of these?  Because the Betelgeuse (ancient name for Satan too) supernova is predicted to happen as early as next year and the earth is also supposed to travel dangerously close to the great rift next year.  Next year happens to be 2012, aka end of Mayan calender, etc.  Its really all just too much to be ignored any longer isn't it?  Personally, I think its all happening right under our feet.  If a day to God like a thousand years to us, then today may be the day of reckoning.  In fact, all of these terrible disasters have all happened in just a few years of each other.      Revelation 1:12 talks about opening the sixth seal.  When the \\"SIXTH SEAL\\" was broken John tells us that there was a \\"GREAT EARTHQUAKE,\\" and the \\"SUN BECAME BLACK AS SACKCLOTH OF HAIR,\\" and the \\"MOON BECAME AS BLOOD,\\" and the \\"STARS OF HEAVEN FELL TO THE EARTH,\\" and the \\"HEAVEN DEPARTED AS A SCROLL,\\" and \\"EVERY MOUNTAIN AND ISLAND WERE MOVED OUT OF THEIR PLACE.\\" The great earthquake is basically happening now.  If you don't believe it, look at the US Geological Service's website [...] and you will see a 7 day window to world quakes.  If you look at a larger window for several years, its frightening how much is happening right under our feet.  It says the moon will become as blood, which has happened many times in history from earthquake gases and volcanic ash released into the atmosphere.  Here is just one example [...]. As for the heavens departing like a scroll and the sun becoming black as a sackcloth, what do you think would happen if we went into a black hole in the universe?   The stars would fall from heaven?   The black hole would make everything fall from heaven, but the star suspiciously named Betelgeuse imploding, becoming a second sun in our own sky for a week or so before dimming to just a glowing cloud of smoke in the night sky would also sufficiently be described in this way. Certainly, every mountain and island would be moved of their place, but again this has already happened in our poles being shifted by earthquakes of recent years.  The entire nation of Japan was shifted 3 feet and the poles moved again.       I am not an overly religious person really. I do not preach or even talk opening about this stuff often, but for some reason I am being compelled to share my insights.   I have many questions about all of it and that is all I am saying to you.  Question Everything.  \\"The Power of Now\\" may just be another cleverly disguised tool of evil and I only want you to consider that as you read or listen to it.  Are you being given instructions to lay down your free will and let another entity take over your body?  Lookup \\"Is Ambien creating a nation of zombies?\\" on Youtube.  It talks about people \\"sleep driving\\" and \\"Sleep walking\\".  It talks about crimes being committed and people even walking off buildings.  What would a demon do if they had control of your body. God gave us free will and Eve chose to be disobedient to God.  He gave them one rule and she broke it.  In keeping with the nature of women in general, they want to be heard by their man.  They want to bring knowledge into the relationship and to be valued for that.  I think that Eve truly thought she was just enlightening Adam, who she loved.  I do not believe she intentionally misled Adam.  In her mind, she had figured out that the fruit was good and she wanted Adam to see it too.  This simply analogy can be applied to life in marriages around the world and the situations they find themselves in daily.Deception comes in many forms.     My mother always told me, \\"God will never give you more than you can handle\\".     Paul tells us: \\"God is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength but with your testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to endure it\\" (1 Corinthians 10:13). Over time that promise has become abbreviated to \\"God will never give you more than you can handle.\\"     Maybe its my job to remind you of this and to draw attention to the devil's tools of manipulation.  Maybe I am being chosen to provide you the way out by sharing this.  Women are Biblically one of those tools as well.   It started in the Garden of Eden.  I am only saying that men are supposed to be the spiritual leaders of the family and that if a woman is leading you down a different path, that you should recognize that for what it is.  Its deception and manipulation.   A woman scorned is not something we should make jokes about.  It is truly an example of the wrath of evil and its real.   There are good moral woman out there, but more alarmingly there are women out there who feel they are good and moral as they lead you down a path of destruction.      I don't know all of the answers. I am certainly no scholar.  I am saying to you to be strong.      Do not lay down your will to an unknown entity, a medication, or a deceptive woman.       I know there are truths that have been shown to me and for some reason it is my responsibility to tell you.    I have done that.      May God protect my soul.

0307477479|2.0|Three things: first, this novel should be made into a television movie, and that's not a compliment. Second, it should be categorized as teen literature, and I'm thinking 13, not 18. And third, the Powerpoint section of the book that has apparently been applauded as brilliant experimental literature will appear laughable in three years, when you'll be finding this novel in the dollar bin at your local used book store. Yes I'm being snarky. It's probably not awful, but blame the Pulitzers for inflating my expectations. Also blame the fact that I had just read Cormac Mcarthy's Blood Meridian, and then went on to Murakami's Wind Up Bird Chronicle... two examples of some serious freaking writing.

B004S5D3B6|5.0|I have to say this is one of the best boxing films ever made. Its based on Micky Ward and although it takes a few liberties with his boxing career I think its probably pretty accurate as far as how things were in his day to day life. They did ignore his fights with Arturo Gatti and made his fight with Shea Neary out to be a world title fight when it wasn't. All the actors and actresses in this did a great job though. I was really impressed. Even if you dont like boxing I'd recomend it. It has a gritty realism and shows what white working class people have to deal with in life which is rare to see from Hollywood.

0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games is the 7th book by Suzanne Collins and the first in the Hunger Games trilogy. It is set in a future time, in a country called Panem, situated in the remains of North America. Panem consists of the Capitol and 12 surrounding Districts, and is a place where life is decidedly less than pleasant for the majority of the population. Narrated by Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old from District 12, it describes a society strictly governed, lives of deprivation, reduced to illegal hunter-gatherer activities to avoid starvation, and tells of the hardship of surviving. Katniss is one of 24 \\"tributes\\", picked by lottery in each District, to participate in a \\"Survivor\\"-type situation, the annual (and nationally televised for compulsory viewing) Hunger Games, a fight to the death with only one winner. It is clear that Collins has done extensive research into hunting, gathering and wilderness survival. The novel emphasises the contrasts between the sumptuous wealth of Capitol and poverty of the Districts. The story reflects real life in that it shows how important image, strategy and sponsors are to success. It is ultimately shows real life stresses condensed in time and magnified in intensity. Think reality TV mixed with wartime battles: this is where Collins got her inspiration. Definitely not Capital L literature, but a page-turner and addictive all the same: you will be seeking out the second instalment, Catching Fire.
B002M9FY94|4.0|hi,  first, it seems that the sound is remastered, it's so good for musiclovers! get the words of each song and a nice packaging with!

B0055SWM08|5.0|top-notch game. Works great on photon. Music is great and themes are very calm and sentimental. \nCertainly worth a Buck.
B004WPYNY8|4.0|This review may seem in some ways very negative. It is not... rather it is that the expectations are so high for this band that I am appearing more critical than necessary.. I will start by saying it is a very modern sounding album, take that as you will...  Dynamics: The guitars are all very good don't ever get me wrong there, hell, not very good. Great. Same with the drums. And the bass, and the vocals etc. But there is not enough dynamics from a songwriting and production perspective for my ear. I would like a little bit more dynamic, if there is a solo, and this goes for keyboards as well, let it stand out, let the production highlight it, if necessary really let it soar. Give it room to breathe.  Keyboards: We all know how great the early orchestrations of Symphony X were. But I feel that they are not as \\"there\\" anymore. Which is a shame for a band with Symphony in there title. They really don't stand out enough anymore, possibly due to the dynamics issue. I really would like to see the keyboards really orchestrate with the rest of the band again. Having said all of that, if this is where the band are musically good for them. I don't think bands should ever change want they want because of people like me voicing my opinion.  Diversity: Because of the above issues each song has difficulty standing out. Which when you consider the talent on offer really makes this a shame.  I found often the choruses were good and catchy but there was not enough to excite elsewhere, and even the chorus' were not produced to really catch the ear and stand out.  So, all said and done, do I recommend this album? Hell yes. But there are caveats. Obviously if you don't like albums that lack some dynamic content then it may not be for you. If you did not like the rougher sounds of Paradise Lost compared to previous albums it may not be for you. If you like Paradise Lost however this should be an almost essential purchase. I do like this album a lot, but can't listen to it yet from start to finish like some other double CD's. I am hoping though that this is one of those albums that is a sneaky grower, but unfortunately at this stage it is an album that is less than the sum of all its parts. It as a whole album ranges between 3 or 4 out of five. I will go for the higher option and revise downward if it doesn't in fact grow on me, although I really hope it does... and that I can revise upward.  Comment
B004Y1USRG|1.0|Sorry boys.  can deal with no jon anderson and rick wakeman but..... I find the solo guitar work has been done many times before by Howe.  I also find the attempt at intsrumetal elongation of songs unsucessfull. I will say that I find the verse sections of some, not all, some melodically accesible, and the lead singer sounds good.  But that is it.  Dont bye the cd ...download the favorites of people. They would be fly from here part 2, and into the storm.
B0020H45ZM|5.0|Firstly, I need to say I have never been a fan of this band and even resisted purchasing this for a long time.. That said, here is the review..    This album grew on me. First listen I was a bit... meh... but after a few solid listens, paying attention all the way to the end it definitely grew on me. While I do not think it's the greatest album of all time, and that the album is let down by one or two weak tunes, the good songs that are here are really right up there. Overall production was of a generally consistent quality while not being the greatest ever, however it rarely lets the album down. All the musicianship is of high quality. Special note there to the drumming. The vocal's will be love/hate. Initially they did not do a great deal for me, but after a while, I sort of \\"got\\" where they were coming from, and once I did, it certainly greatly opened up the appeal of this album. I will say, I do highly recommend this album to you, don't be too scared of samples you may hear online as it will likely grow on you in some parts over time. And it does leave me anticipating the next album - I can only hope this added progginess was not a one off. I will give it 5 stars though but tracks 2 and 3 leave me a bit hesitant to do so... although the last 4 tracks and in particular The Czar, Crack the Skye and The Last Baron more than make up for this.
B0044XV3R8|2.0|We thought that getting this Avatar Special Collectors Edition would be getting the movie with extended scenes plus the making of the movie etc, but all it is is three hours of deleted scenes, etc NO MOVIE and not at all what we expected; spent the money for something we really didn't want, all we wanted was the movie with the added scenes.  Very misleading ad for this.

B0042JIL2E|4.0|Now I come from a generation of rock and roll from the 70's & 80\\"s. Wanting to expand my music horizons I found certain areas that I tended to lean towards and Imelda hit them all. And, I tend to really not favor female artists because they're too girly for my music taste. In Imelda's bio it states how one musician told her the voice needed to be rougher. That, in my opinion was good advice. Love the big bass sound, her cool voice and that little bit of rockabilly mixed with, what did I hear? Surf music, yes! Love it.     I had never heard of her and at the last minute a friend has an extra ticket to go see her in SF. I only had time to take a sneak hear of each of her songs and thought, \\"gee, I can't believe I'm liking this, I'm going\\". And, I'm glad I did. She rocked the place. I love when artists mix genres of music together It's like getting more for your buck.
1416550550|5.0|This is the first and only (so far) book that I've read from Morton. I did not find the writing style confusing at all. \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" is written the same fashion. Yes, this is a thick book. If you are looking for something to read on a two hour flight, this is not the book for you. I for one, could barley put the book down. When I wasn't reading it, I thinking about the charters. I'm still thinking about them. I just hope that my next read is just half as amazing. HIGHLY recommended.
1416562605|4.0|It's more about the misery and the suppressed state of the poor in general (every corner of the world) than India alone...of course for some perverse reasons such societal problems are much more protruding in India than anywhere else (as until now the world is still puzzled and sometimes astonished by some absurd on-going social-ill in India)...but the protagonist here could be anyone...anyone at all...struggling (I would say...wholeheartedly) to break the almost unbreakable shield that PROTECTS the RICH from the POOR...the shield that murders humanity...and sometimes humans.
B000100ENC|5.0|Between 1970 and 1975 Black Sabbath released six great albums that today are classics, in every sense of this overused word. Afterwards the things went very badly indeed. The uncommonly dull ''Technical Ecstasy'' (1976), as thoroughly un-Sabbath as its futuristic cover, and the simply dismal ''Never Say Die'' (1978), which sounds pretty much like cheap copy of the Beatles on steroids, marked the sad end of a great era in the history of rock music. But every band deserves to be judged - if at all - by their best. If we concede that ''Black Sabbath'' (1970) and ''Sabotage'' (1975), the debut and the beginning of the end respectively, fine albums as they may be, do not quite match Sabbath's own extraordinarily high standards, we are left with the four albums in the middle: ''Paranoid'' (1970), ''Master of Reality'' (1971), ''Vol. 4'' (1972) and ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'' (1973).<br /><br />To put the matter bluntly, I personally wouldn't want to be without any of these six albums and would give them all five full stars, despite some mild reservations I may occasionally have. They are utterly different and every one of them has its own unique character. But if I am forced to choose but one Sabbath album from the Ozzy years, I would most probably go with ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath''.<br /><br />Whether ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'' is your favourite album or not, like virtually everything else, is purely a matter of taste. But it is beyond dispute that this is their most sophisticated, varied and musically mature album. It was inevitable, perhaps, that it should turn to be the pinnacle of their discography from the 1970s. Indeed, nothing like it can be found among the greatest rock music of the time, with the possible exception of Led Zeppelin's Fourth album and ''Physical Graffiti''. There are but eight songs in ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'', but all deserve a few words of their own.<br /><br />''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'' opens the album with one of Tony's most unforgettable riffs. Curiously, the song has never become a concert favourite, even though it would certainly make a fine opportunity for terrific headbanging. The second part of the song, in particular, is one of the slowest and heaviest things ever recorded by Sabbath. The first part, on the other hand, can boast a marvellous lyrical passage.<br /><br />''A National Acrobat'' is an entirely different affair, as often happens in this album. It's a complex three-part composition with some of Tony's most whimsical guitar work, especially the obsessive riff-solo towards the end. The intense middle part is in somewhat stark contrast with the buoyant outer ones. It includes most of the text which, mostly, matches the quality of the music, even if after-life speculations are not your cup of tea:<br /><br />Just remember love is life<br />And hate is living death<br />Treat your life for what it's worth<br />And live for every breath<br />Looking back I've lived and learned<br />But now I'm wondering<br />Here I wait and only guess<br />What this next life will bring<br /><br />''Fluff'' is no mere fluff, as some superficial fellows seem to think. It's a most beautiful instrumental in which at least three different guitars, all played by Tony of course, are ingeniously combined; there is only bass and a hint of keyboards to keep them company. The piece has serenity and tranquility that are not often associated with Black Sabbath. Yet ''Fluff'' has a distinguished pedigree: ''Orchid'' from ''Master of Reality'' and ''Laguna Sunrise'' from ''Vol. 4''. Like the album on the whole, this perfectly delightful instrumental is the pinnacle in its category.<br /><br />''Sabbra Cadabra'' is the kind of stuff that's so uniquely Sabbath that it can hardly bear any other treatment. It was a great mistake on Metallica's side to try it, and even guitar magician such as Kirk Hammett couldn't pull off convincingly the wacky major riff. The lyrics are some of the most outrageously flippant in whole album,recounting Ozzy's sexual escapades, but with such stupendous music who cares? This is also the song with most prominent keyboards in the whole album, and it is here that Rick Wakeman himself makes a memorable appearance.<br /><br />''Killing Yourself to Live'' is one of the more straightforward tracks, pretty heavy but with a great variety of quite outstanding guitar riffs and solos. Indeed, this is perhaps the most complex composition in the whole album, having at least three clearly defined sections none of which, except the first, includes any repetition. In earlier times, Sabbath might have made at least two songs of this material.<br /><br />''Who Are You?'' could not have been more different than its predecessor. It's a somber and restrained song full of bizarre sounds and virtually without any guitar riffs or solos. The text is one of the most serious and shattering in the whole album. It takes some time to realize that this is actually Ozzy's conversation with God himself. I guess He won't be amused:<br /><br />Yes I know the secret<br />That's within your mind<br />You think all the people<br />Who worship you are blind<br />You're just like Big Brother<br />Giving us your trust<br />And when you have played enough<br />You'll just cast our souls<br />Into the dust<br />Into the dust<br /><br />You thought that it would be easy<br />From the very start<br />Now I've found you out<br />I don't think you're so smart<br />I only have one more question<br />Before my time is through<br />Please I beg you tell me<br />In the name of hell<br />Who are you?<br />Who are you?<br /><br />''Looking For Today'' is a most welcome relief: cheerful stuff with one of Tony's most ebullient riffs. There is more in it, though. ''Looking for Today'' shares with the title song the highly effective idea of introducing a beautiful and tranquil passage, entirely different mood, in the middle of the guitar maelstrom. The contrast, as in the other case, works wonderfully.<br /><br />''Spiral Architect'' is a most fitting conclusion for it is the craziest song here. Especially the lyrics are quite a mish-mash of science fiction, fantasy and pure nonsense. I and a friend of mine used to joke that these ''silver ships on plasmic oceans'' were inspired by fag ends floating in beer. You know, there is a great story - apocryphal or not - how this text was written. Apparently, Ozzy was out of inspiration and called Geezer. The bassist told him to call back in half an hour. He did and was told the complete text. Ozzy loved it so much that he couldn't but ask: ''What did you smoke, man?!'', to which Geezer replied innocently ''Ah, nothing, I wrote it on the grass outside.'' ''Do you happen to sell this grass? Can I buy it'', Ozzy immediately inquired. No matter how strange the text, the music is definitely of the same stupendous quality as the rest of the album.<br /><br />My only qualm with ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'' is actually the usual one I have with all of Sabbath's early albums: a little too much guitar dubbing, particularly of solos. A very minor point of course. The album is very well recorded sonically, indeed better than any Sabbath album before (or since indeed, with the possible exception of ''Heaven and Hell'', but that's quite another story).<br /><br />Musically and artistically, ''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath'' is an essential listening for anybody interested in rock music from those heady times - the 1970s - which will never again occur.

B003ZHVJFK|4.0|This is a five-star movie for those who like to watch other people play video games. In our corporate run post-apocalyptic world, society has digressed to those who work for corporations and those who thrive off the black market in the slums. Jin, who has been taught marshal arts by his mother, is an excellent street fighter. When his mother is killed by the corporation, Jin, who was a side line player, vows revenge against the leader of the corporation Tekken. He then enters the Iron Fist competition as the \\"People's Choice\\" as a way to get access to the leader (\\"Death Race 2000\\").<br /><br />The movie copied many memorable aspects of other fight/apocalyptic movies. It bares similarities to \\"Soylent Green,\\" \\"Running Man,\\" \\"Rollerball,\\" and \\"Thunderdome.\\" One fighter says, \\"Do you know where you're at? You're at [not Thunderdome] Iron Fist.\\" Similarities between this and various \\"Rocky\\" films is also noticeable. The movie uses a heavy metal grinding music for its many fight scenes.<br /><br />The movie takes a number of small twists as there are forces within Tekken that want Jin to succeed, but more powerful forces that want him dead.<br /><br />Lines form other movies come to my mind: \\"Two men enter, one man leaves.\\" \\"Luke, I am your father.\\" \\"Get up Rock!\\" and \\"I'm not going to kill the Agorn.\\"<br /><br />The movie runs fairly cliche and is designed for a young teen (male) audience.<br /><br />No f-bombs, brief sex scene, and was that brief nudity at the disco? Kelly Overton's butt crack.
B000002KDO|5.0|This is a very odd parallel, but it seems to me that ''Master of Reality'' (1971) is to Sabbath's discography what ''Reign in Blood'' (1986) is to Slayer's. Of course in the meantime - mere 15 years - heavy metal changed quite a bit, especially in terms of sound. Yet both albums were third for the bands and both were linked with extremes: only where Slayer speeded up to the limits of the possible, Sabbath slowed down more than ever before or since. And they got heavier, too. By modern standards, or even by those of the early 1980s, ''Master of Reality'' is light stuff. But consider the year of its release: 1971! This is the year of Led Zeppelin's classic ''IV'' and Deep Purple's ''Fireball'', both of them conspicuously lighter fare (which, of course, has no relation to their musical value). I wonder what a shock for the world of rock music something like ''Master of Reality'' must have been in 1971. Well, whatever the case was, the album has aged fantastically well.    This is Sabbath's shortest and less varied album, yet it is one of the most unique in terms of sound and atmosphere. It is, in fact, haunting. There are only eight songs here, and two of them are short instrumentals (''Embryo'' and ''Orchid''). The rest six, however, consist of five impressive compositions and one unusually subdued ballad. The latter is ''Solitude'' and it does require quite a feat of imagination to recognize Ozzy's voice. The song has its predecessor in the even more bizarre ''Planet Caravan'' from ''Paranoid'' (1970), but it is rather more successful. The rest are all classics. ''Sweet Leaf'', with its landmark cough in the beginning - reportedly Tony choked while smoking some low-quality joint - and the dazzling ''Children of the Grave'', the fastest track here, have been concert favourites more or less since 1971. (Note the monstrously heavy sound of the slow part in the latter: without analog in the rock music of the early 1970s.) ''Lord of This World'' and ''Into the Void'' are the slowest tracks here (apart from one very fast section in the latter). This is the sound that has become all but Sabbath's trademark and it is not for nothing that it is considered to have played some part in the development of the so called ''doom metal''. Distorted riffs, tortured solos, crushing bass, wailing vocals - there is plenty of everything any fan of the early Sabbath might want.    The album is particularly well recorded, too. The constant attempts of Tony and Geezer to outplay each other have seldom been captured with such clarity. Bill's drums and Ozzy's voice come out powerfully but very well blended with the guitars and the bass. And one last point: the lyrics once again prove, if any proof is needed, that Black Sabbath never really had anything to do with puerile stuff like Satanism. Their texts may not be profound, but they aren't concerned with black magic either. Instead, an ode to joint (''Sweet Leaf''), a warning about the future (''Children of the Grave''), religious speculations (''After Forever'', ''Lord of This World'') and something like science fiction (''Into the Void'') are the themes here.    In short, terrific early Sabbath well worth the time and the attention of anybody seriously interested in rock music from the 1970s. Sabbath fans, of course, will have acquired the album long time ago. If there are any young fellows who are fascinated by some of the classic albums produced by Black Sabbath during the Ozzy era, but haven't yet heard ''Master of Reality'', I suggest they hasten to rectify this.
B005FNPIG8|3.0|The movie comes at you fast with a lot of major plot points in the beginning.<br /><br />The film opens with a Ukrainian wedding scene. Waiters are getting patted down. One waiter (Jean-Claude Van Damme), skilled in knives, cuts the throat of the big boss and escapes to his secret apartment...meanwhile another assassin, Flint lives in seclusion caring for his comatose wife (Bianca Van Varenberg).<br /><br />Also going on is a quick scene involving Interpol corruption scandal and an investigation. Seems the Interpol is selling guns that they seize back to the criminals. They are afraid that Flint(Scott Adkins) can take them down, so they order his assassination. In order to flush him out they release a crime boss named Polo (Ivan Kaye) from prison, who had gang raped and beat Flint's wife comatose. In addition to Flint, Jean-Claude Van Damme, who gets paid in diamonds, is also summoned to do the Polo assassination. Polo is hunting the man (Van-Damme) who killed his brother in the first scene, but doesn't know who performed the deed.<br /><br />Now if this wasn't enough, Van Damme is distracted by his new neighbors, a prostitute (Marija Karan) and a pimp who beats her. Van Damme doesn't want Flint to kill Polo or else he loses his fee, so he goes after Flint too. Flint realizes Interpol set him up by freeing Polo, so he wants to kill them too. Got all that?<br /><br />Unlikely alliances form to narrow down the factions. Outside of Van Damme, the acting was acceptable. While the plot sounds complex, it really isn't that hard to follow, unless you have problems following Steven Seagal movies. It takes a while to build up all the factions and reasons for wanting to kill each other, but once it does things move rather quickly.<br /><br />F-bomb (with Ukrainian accent), violence against women (its a Van Damme film), brief nudity, torture.
B004HO6I4W|4.0|Rio is a great story full of vibrant colors, fun, great music, and personal challenges. Blu, the lead parrot, is taken to Rio to mate with the only remaining female of his species. Let's just say it wasn't love at first bite. But in the process, he is snatched by a group of bird smuggling thugs and handcuffed to his female companion. Unfortunately, Blu doesn't know how to fly and all of their escapes are hindered by his need to walk everywhere. Couple this with the lively atmosphere of the Carnival build-up and Blu's heartbroken owner trying desperately to find him. It's a story of cooperation, personal struggles, and hope for the endangered species especially in our rainforests.<br /><br />The music is fun, the characters are huge on the spectrum of being likable or hated. The animal characters speak so we see things from all perspectives. I hate to say it but the movie dragged a little for me in some spots. I'm not sure why it didn't keep my attention but my kids (ages 7 and 12) enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />It doesn't have the same deep emotional connections that Disney movies are so good at creating. But it was fun none-the-less.
1451629184|5.0|First of all let me say to those complaining about the language, this book was written the way it was because that is  Jaycee's level of education. If it were written by someone else for her it would not have the same effect. The things that this young women went through were horrific, and if you can make it past the first several chapters you will see how truly inspiring she is. Jaycee is truly a great example for women who lived through terrible events such as these. I hope her story inspires others to speak up when in danger. This book is a must read.
1451629184|4.0|Jaycee has done a great job of giving us an all-too-real portrayal of the horrors she went through during her captivity. While she touches on times that seem normal (planting a garden, taking care of pets) we can't ever forget the horror she endured every day and the mental anguish she had to go through (not to mention her mother and her children). No book will ever give the true horror of spending day after day being raped, held captive, and taken away from your family at such a young and vulnerable age. The Garridos are pure evil and I can't believe what they did, as a team, to this poor little girl. The mind of a pedophile is a true horror and I wish there was some way to change them.<br /><br />The story is written in a rather immature style, as would be expected from someone who was taken so young and held for so many years. It is a quick read but only gives a hint of the physical and mental torture Jaycee endured.<br /><br />After reading this, I'm not even sure what any parent could do any different to prevent this from happening. Many children walk to school or the bus, I did growing up and there was no parent every step of the way.<br /><br />The only true failure here was the parole system that never seemed to think that there was anything odd going on. Even when officers met Jaycee's daughters, there was never a red flag. It was a true failure of our system to get Jaycee out of this horrible situation much earlier than she did.
159514188X|5.0|This is a wonderful book. This book is well written and takes on the topic of teenage suicide with a delicate yet in your face touch. From the moment the audio tapes were received until the end of the book it makes you think about how your everyday actions effect those around you. From little things to big things that spiral way out of control. What may seem like a simple thing can cause a large chain reaction. This is a great book to use in teen discussion groups! This is a must read for teenagers and adults!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie is simply wonderful!  I love this movie even more than Pride and Prejudice (Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle) and Jane Eyre (Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson)! And that's saying a lot! Richard Armitage and Daniela Denby-Ashe are perfect together. This is absolutely one of the best movies and my favorite! Enjoy!
140053271X|2.0|For what I wanted it to do, namely display some of the pdf files and books that I already have on hand, this does a pretty poor job of it. The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf. There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you. The settings page is a joke, there is almost no customization to be had there. The shop's main view was nonfunctional out of the box; every time I tried to access it, it kicked me back out to the main page, and I had to access it by going to the \\"top 100\\" page instead, and even then the search would sometimes not work. The battery capacity went down 20% over 4 days, so I don't think that it would make the 2 month mark that it should have.    For all of it's failings, it gets much better once it is rooted, as underneath it all, it is still an android 2.1 device. Once that happens, you have access to the android market, email, web browser, and more importantly, you can get apps that are better than the default nook book reader. You can even put amazon's android kindle reader on it as well.    The reason for the relatively low rating is that all of these features and functionality should have been unlocked by default. The default software that comes with it feels unfinished and lacking in features to me, and it seems like B&N were just being lazy when putting it together. Rooting it is also a pain, and even though there are some rough edges in a fully unlocked android OS on an eink interface, I still think that it is better than the default software. I would rate this as 4/5 if it came unlocked by default.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I picked up The Hunger Games after it was recommended by someone in my book club.  My club turned it down because they considered it to be too sci-fi, but I love fantasy and sci-fi so I immediately downloaded it on my Kindle.  I read the book in 3 days - I barely slept and I kept sneaking glances at the book during work!  I actually enjoyed it far more than the book we ended up choosing for book club.  I don't think the sci-fi would put anyone off.  This book is perfect for all audiences!

1594744769|3.0|I really, really hoped that I would enjoy this book, but maybe my hopes were just too high.  The premise sounded good.  The writing really wasn't terrible.  But there were too many major problems with it that kept me from enjoying it.    1. The story really doesn't get rolling until about the last third of the book.  The first 2/3 are fine, but as far as what I expected from the book (the peculiar children, a mysterious orphanage, etc.), I had a while to wait.    2. Once we get into the meat of it, there are too many characters.  I had a really hard time keeping them all straight when they were all involved in the action-y bits.  The main few were easy enough; the rest, not so much, especially when some of their names begin with the same letter.    3. The photographs seemed forced.  The author used several real (though sometimes slightly altered) old photos to represent the peculiar children.  It's a neat idea, but for the most part, I felt that the writing was forced to fit the photos.  And sometimes the photos still didn't fit, such as a photo supposedly of a child being obviously of an adult, and photos that were supposed to be of the same person not looking identical.    4. Only one of the children's \\"peculiarities\\" seemed unique. I won't spoil what it is, but the others were, in my opinion, tired examples of special abilities.  A floating girl, an invisible boy, a girl who creates fire, a girl with super strength, a boy with prophetic dreams, etc.  I've seen these represented in fiction too many times to think they're cool.    That being said, part of my problem with the book probably has to do with the fact that it seems to have been written for a younger audience.  The writing is good and flows relatively well, but it doesn't get very in depth into anything, especially emotional moments.  However, there is a bit of swearing (as a typical 16-year-old probably would do), and there were a few scenes that were more violent and gory than I expected, especially forsomething that felt more appropriate for a young adult audience (rather than the YA/adult lit that I tend to enjoy more).      The book ends at a point in the story that definitely implies sequels.  I wasn't disappointed in the ending though, and there is a plus side for anyone who wants more of the story: implications that we may see Jacob's grandfather again... and possible battles with monster Nazis.
B004OR1X6A|5.0|....but a great album that the man himself didn't like the mix down of back in 1978. Rory wanted nothing to do with it & it was abandoned for his much favored \\"Top Priority\\" album from the following year but in hindsight,its one of his better albums & maybe if Rory had lived to re-visit this,he might have agreed.  This CD will not disappoint Rory's fans although a little off track for his albums he was making at the time. The songs are brilliant. The production is top notch. This is NOT an album just thrown together to capitalize on the death (and sell ability) of a dead rock star. This is a real album,not thrown together from bottom-of-the-barrel tracks that Rory tossed out.<br /><br />Well worth the cost.<br /><br />If you've never heard or heard of Rory Gallagher,try any of his live CDs.

1594202710|5.0|Now 88 years old, one of the twentieth century's pre-eminent diplomats dips once more into the formidable store of experience accumulated since his first visit to China some 40 years ago and offers up a rich hybrid of memoir, autobiography and foreign policy analysis on China.<br /><br />With the definitive emergence of China as heir apparent to superpower status and its growing global economic and political clout, the timing of this book could not be better. It should be of interest not only to students of international relations and diplomacy, but to a broader audience of readers both in China and the West seeking a better understanding of the thinking behind the policies of China in a rapidly globalizing world.<br /><br />\\"On China\\" begins with a lengthy but fascinating look at the early history of the Middle Kingdom stretching back four millennia, during which China regarded itself as the centre of the globe and saw its own culture and traditions as the highest forms of human attainment. It describes the national humiliation represented by the European intervention beginning in the late 18th century that imposed terms of trade and a general opening up of the empire to the outside world. Much of China's current foreign and domestic policies, in particular its obsession with national unity and stability and its rejection of anything that can be construed as interference in the country's domestic affairs, can be explained, according to Kissinger, by the wounds caused by that period.<br /><br />The narrative continues with the period of national consolidation under Mao Zedong and the opening up to the United States continued by Deng Xiaoping, a process in which the writer was a key participant. Kissinger's narrative is enriched by the numerous first-hand accounts of his meetings with virtually all of the Chinese leaders from Mao Zedong to Hu Jintao and by his access to hitherto classified documents. The book ends with an overview of the current state of US-China relations in which he argues for a more nuanced foreign policy towards China by the United States that took account of the historical realities that shape China's attitudes towards the West, including the rejection of Western notions of liberal democracy and human rights. China's position was summed up in an \\"oral message\\" sent by its political leaders to then President Bush through Kissinger in September 1990:<br /><br />\\"For over a century, the Chinese people were all along subjected to bullying and humiliation by foreign powers. We do not want to see this wound reopened. I believe that as an old friend of China, Mr. President, you understand the sentiments of the Chinese people. China cherishes Sino-US friendly relations and cooperation which did not come easily, but it cherishes its independence, sovereignty and dignity even more.\\"<br /><br />Along the way, Kissinger offers trenchant observations of the players on the international stage. Gorbachev, for example, \\"had recognized the pervasive stagnation (of communism) but lacked the imagination or skill to break through its built-in rigidities.\\" Comparing the difference in personalities between Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong, he wrote that \\"Mao dominated any gathering; Zhou suffused it. Mao's passion strove to overwhelm opposition; Zhou's intellect would seek to persuade or outmaneuver it; Mao was sardonic; Zhou penetrating. Mao thought of himself as a philosopher; Zhou saw his role as an administrator or a negotiator. Mao was eager to accelerate history; Zhou was content to exploit its currents. A saying he often repeated was `The helmsman must ride with the waves.' When they were together, there was no question of the hierarchy, not simply in the formal sense but the deeper aspect of Zhou's extraordinarily deferential conduct.\\"<br /><br />The reader may be forgiven for wondering to what extent Kissinger's current incarnation as an international consultant on all things China might be responsible for the generally reverential tone of this his sixteenth book. It is true that the narrative is suffused with a degree of romanticism that glosses over the excesses of the Cultural Revolution and the suppression of the student demonstrators at Tiananmen Square as secondary to the higher purpose of maintaining the stability of a system which in one generation has transformed a poverty-stricken nation into a global economic giant to which many a recession-plagued Western economy now looks for assistance. The senile and dribbling Chairman Mao, regarded in the end as a mad monster by many, including within the Chinese leadership circle, comes across in Kissinger's narrative as doddering in his later years but fearless, wise and benevolent.<br /><br />The heroes, if any, in this account are the generation of leaders of the post-Mao era steering a course between the perceived all-important need for unity and stability and the freedoms that would unleash the full creative energies of the Chinese people and thereby guarantee their future prosperity. Of these leaders, Deng Xiao Ping, who was thrice purged from power by Mao and whose son, Deng Pufang, was tormented by Red Guards and pushed off the roof of a building at Beijing University during the Cultural Revolution and then denied admission to hospital for his broken back, emerges as the transformative leader who challenged the orthodoxies bequeathed by Mao and set the Middle Kingdom on a new course towards modernity and prosperity.<br /><br />This book, the distillation of more than 40 years of engagement with China and some 50 visits, both public and private, to that country, helps to dispel some of the commonly held stereotypes about China and gives both the general public and decision-makers a more nuanced basis on which to make decisions or form judgements about the awakened giant.true that the narrative is suffused with a degree of romanticism that glosses over the excesses of the Cultural Revolution and the suppression of the student demonstrators at Tiananmen Square as secondary to the higher purpose of maintaining the stability of a system which in one generation has transformed a poverty-stricken nation into a global economic giant to which many a recession-plagued Western economy now looks for assistance.

But in spite of this, I finished the book feeling uplifted, full of hope and understanding for Alice's plight and experience.    I can highly recommend this book.
1451629184|5.0|I already had this in cassette or in a book form but I am picking up things I hadn't before,  It is a wonderful series and I wish I could afford the whole one.
B001IF252M|5.0|I got this for my younger brother's Mac. This is the official one, and it works fine.  The thing's chord is a bit short, but most VGA chords on your monitors are long enough.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The series is my all-time favorite -- great writing, great characters, and you don't really have to be \\"into\\" politics to enjoy it.      This set is  great, as well -- it holds the entire series in one relatively compact box.  Much better than having seven separate seasons of boxes.  As long as you don't need it to fit in a DVD storage rack (which I don't), it's great.
0399215921|2.0|I wish the information given about the book would have mentioned it was a very small book.  I was very disappointed at the size.
0618526412|5.0|It's been a while since I read a book that I wanted to slow down the pace and savor each word.  Carson McCullers' \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" has definitely achieved it for me.  Her art form is well organized with three parts and a total of fifteen short chapters.  Each chapter she dives into one character's heart and soul beautifully, Singer, Biff, Mick, Dr. Copeland and Jake transcend in front of my eyes.  The storyline flows from one character to the next like refreshing soft crisp spring shower.  I am amazed for an age of 23; Carson was able to develop in depth of a small early 1960's southern mill town's social issues with truth and intellectual poise.  Her language fills with imagery.  I love the humor of this sentence when she describes a small boy when he walks into town.  \\"A little youngun passing along the street stopped and opened his fly to make water.\\"  I become so close to each of the characters that I wished so hard that something good would happen to at least one of them.  I was heart broken at the same time rooted for their life decisions based on ignorance and pure innocence.  Carson's story is suitable for all ages to read.  We can all take away her message of based on poverty and limited education - how should we look forward to the next day?  Check out my other book reviews  [..]
B001F6TXME|4.0|This remote release cord does everything it promises to do. Easily plugs into its connection on the side of my camera and functions perfectly one shot at a time or, when held down, multiple exposures. However, there is a sliding locking device that holds the shutter button down and this can engage accidentally. I found my camera rapidly firing off shots without any input from me. It was only until I realized that the lock had been accidentally engaged, that I was able to remedy the situation. So, this is a perfect accessory for my Nikon but I am careful about accidentally sliding the button lock.
1439177783|1.0|This book was absolutely horrible. It completely trivialized eating disorders, and was a self-indulgent attempt to glamorize hollywood dieting and anorexia. While I empathize with Portia's struggles, I do not understand why in an attempt to shed light on eating disorders, she writes a 'how to' book with numbers, tips, and ways to deceive for others who struggle with these issues. This book is extremely triggering, and could easily have been called \\"Portia's extreme weight loss method- she can do it and so can you!\\". If Portia had done any research into recovery stories whatsoever, she would have realized that this book was extremely self-serving and sabotages the work that the recovery movement is trying to do.
1451629184|5.0|It came in mint condition, It wasn't along story at all. It was well written. I felt like I was a fly on a wall watching her live her life it was amazing. If she's still not sure on what to do with her life I think she should become a novalist.
0345529057|5.0|These books are impossible to put down.  the characters are whole and feeling, and you follow them holding your breath when they are in danger, commisserating with them when they sorrow and delight in their successes and triumphs!  read these books!!
B001AQO3XS|2.0|I can not believe some of the positive reviews on this site like the one below. This transfer is INEXCUSABLE for Blu-Ray. This fantastic movie deserved to be properly remastered. The sound was hallow and tinny. The picture quality was poor, appearing quite grainy. People can refer to that as a \\"look\\" or a \\"style\\" all they like, it is an excuse for a completely botched, poor transfer.
0553801473|2.0|It is one of those books that is long, long long. You better have a great memorie for names and places, for they just keep coming.  It is easy to get lost in the words in this book. There are truly just too many.<br /><br />It is a great story, it is just watered down by being way too long. The same action happens over and over again. I felt like I could have skipped half the words and know exactly what is going to happen. So, right now, I have put the book down for I get bored of blood and the perils of traveling. I hope to pick it up again when I have nothing else to read.  I give this book a solid mediocre.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella!  I had no idea this was a ghost story (which I also love) but I am so thankful for this great book!  Just the right mix of humor, romance, mystery. Please write a sequel Ms.Kinsella!
0062060554|2.0|This book was chosen for my book club given all the positive reviews on amazon and elsewhere.    The book was so dull I struggled to get through it.  It seemed like a bad rip off of an excellent movie (Memento) and was mostly the main character bemoaning her situation.  My biggest issue was how much the author required that you suspend disbelief in a book that was supposed to be based in reality.  It just defied all logic.  And the conclusion could have been spotted a mile away.    Save your money and your time.  I'm starting to lose faith in the reviews on sites because while I can understand the subjective nature of literature, I can hardly believe so many folks gave this 4 & 5 starts.  My book club members agree, this was a major snooze.

B00003XAVA|5.0|Brings back memories of seeing Crosby and Nash at Tanglewood when this album came out.  Excellent liner notes added to the CD from Crosby.  Killer harmonies!
1451629184|2.0|It was an okay book. I was expecting it to be better. To be honest, I read most of it, but  I lost interest and I didn't finish it. She repeats herself ALOT and reverts from being kidnapped to now frequently. I know she didn't have very much schooling but what's her editor's excuse? I'll give it 2 stars because with all the hype maybe I expected too much. Disappointing.
B004LWZVZC|2.0|I went into this movie with a bit of trepidation, but my parents insisted on seeing it, so i rented it. What a mistake, i've always disliked Robert Redford movies for the simple fact that they are long winded and flat out boring. This movie is no exception, and has been mainly accused of wearing out the audience because of it's stage (broadway like) presentation. Which it basically is. I wanted to see a movie about the history of Abraham Lincoln, not just another assassination movie where they show a guy dressed up as Lincoln who never speaks, but just gets killed. Again that's what happens here. This isn't a spoiler, it's just a movie about the people who conspired to kill the President, and it's just not very well executed in the least. It compares itself to Kill A Mockingbird, and A Time To Kill as a great court room thriller, but is anything but that. It's bland, the acting is very cardboardish, and TV like, bordering on poor. And by the time the movie ends, if you can make it that far, you just look back on it and really don't care. You basically say, it was ok, walk off and never speak of it again. Next time give us, the fans with Lincoln actually in it, and then have the assassination at the end. That would be a lot more exciting, since in this time period it's really irrelevant WHO killed Lincoln. Since we know.    Yes it says August 13th. Pay Per View people. Or just download it for free. hehe
B002HH9TUG|2.0|It is really a great idea - A substitute for those expensive racing wheels. Unfortunately it was done by Thrustmaster, who makes the cheapest quality stuff I have ever seen. If it had been done by Logitech it probably would have been a hit. The joysticks break off or the rubber tops come off. The \\"wheel\\" is gritty and has too much play. The paint comes off quickly and the thing just screams poor quality control. It isn't recognised in hardly any games (including racing games) and it just doesn't do what it's meant to do. A regular Logitech controller works better and lasts a long time. This one just falls apart.
B0057A6GA6|2.0|It appears every level has  only one way to solve successfully.  Pretty much a good time waster, but not worth buying.
030746363X|4.0|I really haven't had time to go through the whole book yet.  It is a larger book than I anticipated.  But, what I have seen so far looks great and my roommate is impressed as well.  More when I've read it through.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I really don't get the negative reviews of this movie. I watched it with my two grandchildren (10 & 13) and we all loved it. The characters are fantastic and parts of it are very, very funny. The animation was great on our HD TV. Totally enjoyable for us.
1451629184|4.0|I have not yet finished the book but I have read more than half of it and it is a good read. I bought this book because I was interested in the story behind this tragedy. But if you have seen the TV interview of Jaycee then it pretty much is the book. I find the book to be an easy read.
B005BZQS1E|4.0|It's nothing special, but it delivers on the premise and offers up a number of genuine laughs.  I was a bit worried when I saw the poor to average reviews, but all in all I'm glad that I watched it.  Low expectations may have helped.  One gag in particular was priceless.
B00005MP58|2.0|I am very disappointed with the product, I have the original recording from 1996, and your version is approximatly 2 hours short, a whole chapter of the story was chopped off.  I do not recommend this video.
079284131X|5.0|Chucky has gotten corny through the years, witty perhaps, since he started speaking, but for those who watched Child's Play, he really didn't open his mouth until the end of the movie to speak, and when he did it was horrifying.  After that, it just got corny in all the sequels.  But for this classic, the silent doll, talking only friendly, or whispering into Andy's ear, he is as eery as ever, and I found myself jumping all over again as I introduced this horror icon to my 12 year old who has been begging for Chucky for years now.  Be afraid, be very afraid!
B000SEKZLC|4.0|You know this, right? Yemen, previously called \\"The Yemen,\\" lies on the fringe of the Arabian Peninsula as is best known today as a world-class producer of sand, desert heat, and political violence. Salmon are, of course, cold-water fish that are challenging to catch with a rod and reel but taste all the better once caught. So, we're on the same page, yes?<br /><br />Now consider the chances of finding a novel that adroitly mixes not just Yemen and salmon fishing but also the British Parliament, Al Qaeda, a mystical sheikh, the art of public relations, a sad love story, and a journey of self-discovery. Before I read this book, I would have defied anyone to accomplish that seemingly impossible task. But Paul Torday has managed to do so, brilliantly, producing a satirical treatment of British politics that is alternately affecting and screamingly funny.<br /><br />Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is the first of British author Paul Torday's six novels to date. Written when he was 59 years old at the end of a successful business careeer, the book reportedly allowed him to write about what he knows best (as every teacher urges in Creative Writing 101). As you might guess, what Paul Torday appears to know best are salmon fishing and the Middle East, and the resulting novel is the unique expression of a genuine talent.<br /><br />(From [...])
B0019UGYK0|1.0|I was very upset that this movie skipped half way through.  I tried to clean it and do what I could but it is defective.  So sorry I cant return it.  I am usually very pleased with Amazon, this time I was not.  Once you review the movie, you own it!
1451629184|5.0|A heart-wrentching, bittersweet, true account of a young girl's abduction.  A story that will make you cry and tug at your heart page after page.  I have a personal struggle with this story as I lived in So. Lake Tahoe when this happened.  My family, along with many, many others in the community, worked long and hard to bring Jaycee home.  Although we never could, there was always hope.  That light at the end of the tunnel finally shined through for Jaycee Dugard.  May God Bless her and her family.
0756404738|3.0|****CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS****    I enjoyed parts of the book, but that being said, it was a lengthy  mess.    Kvothe's super human prowess continues in this book, add to his already  lengthy traits, fighting skill and sexual prowess.  I can't wait to  see what he learns in book 3, he is already Einstein, Brad Pitt, Bruce  Lee, Wordsworth, Thomas Edison & Casanova rolled into one.    In book one, Denna's scenes were tiring at best, now they are just  excruciatingly painful to read. Yes, we know Denna is like a timid fawn in a grassy field, ready to bolt at the drop of a leaf, yes, we know she is like a delicate flower that will wilt at the 1st rays of the sun, merciful Tehlu, just kiss her and bed her and have done with it.  She is, to all appearances, just a high class prostitute.  The fact that Kvothe puts her on such a high pedestal makes it all that more ridiculous.  How many more fruitless meetings between Kvothe and Denna do we have to endure?  I found myself hoping her  patron would just bludgeon her to death so we could move the story along.     Another problem I found is that in book one, Kvothe mentions that when Ambrose finally gets him kicked out of school, it comes as a total surprise because they had come to a truce or a calm, really?  Do you call breaking into Ambrose's apartments a truce?  Do you call burning his apartment and rubbing his nose into it a truce, writing false letters about a fake pregnancy from a former lover a truce?  Is that suppose to be the calm before the storm that totally surprises you when Ambrose gets you kicked out of the university?  Apparently Rothfuss totally forgot about mentioning this in book one.    \\"Fine\\", this is a word that is apparently a common thing for everyone in every part of the kingdom to put at the end of their sentences.  \\"Fine\\" is overused this entire novel, by nearly every character, no matter where they are from or what their language.  It reminded me of the oft used teen phrase\\"Like\\".  Fine, like, whatever, it was a bit annoying.      Kvothe for some unapparent reason turns into a cold blooded, vicious killer.  The blood magic he used on the mercenaries were one thing, but the torturous, cold-blooded murder of the bandits pretending to be Edema Ruh was insane to say the least.  You've poisoned them, right, lets get the girls and leave, maybe even tie the bandits up and give to the nearest constable, but to mercilessly hunt down, kill and torture the poisoned men and women?  This is made all the more odd because Kvothe was just taught by the Adem about the pitfalls of killing out of anger, it doesn't make any sense.  Is this the Lathani?  Maybe Shehyn should have cut his fingers off so he couldn't abuse his new found martial arts, which is exactly what he went and did.    An enjoyable book that is better than 90% of the other fantasy out there, but not close to the first book.  The novel is bloated and contradicts itself at times.  Makes me wonder how he's going to finish this thing in one more book when book 2 basically didn't move the story along at all.
0307477479|1.0|I can't believe this book won the Pulitzer!  Mildly entertaining in parts, at best.  A series of short stories linked by overlapping characters seems like a cheap out for an author who couldn't be bothered with actually writing a novel.  She is certainly no Alice Munro.  I wouldn't bother if I were you.

B004G5ZY7E|5.0|The Snowman begins with less intensity than Nesbo's previous novels and continues that way for awhile.  Perhaps due to the diversion of Hole breaking in a new team and the absence of some familiar characters.  Perhaps because Hole's new boss, Hagan, is developing an interesting respect for Hole's skills.  Perhaps because it was just time for a breather after a series of incredibly exciting novels. Who knows? But the plot was characteristically complicated and Harry's roller-coaster self-appraisal and his affair with Jim Beam were still around, present now almost as part of the familiar, never-ending background in his mind.  The book was mind-capturing and still one of the \\"gotta find out how it all ends\\" variety.  But, Readers, be patient because the ending is gobsmacking!  One can almost see Nesbo grinning and giving an \\"I told you so\\" wink as the pace picks up, almost unnoticed, and the absent intensity makes its appearance!  And it's really worth the wait! Another fantastic read, The Snowman, and almost exhausting because the excitement takes such awhile to show up.  Nesbo is an outstanding writer who, in my mind, can already take his place up there with the best (if not The Best). He weaves his stories methodically and smoothly and leads you along with an astonishing array of related facts that are interesting and intriguing.  That's five in a row, now; keep them coming, Jo!
0811875555|5.0|Love the movie, Love the Book.<br />The character sketches are great (and there's a lot!), the set art is beautiful, the digital paintings are astounding.<br />I recommend it for any Disney princess lover, or art book collector. I really love this one :)

B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is so quirky it'll make anybody happy. It's artistic, stylish, cute, fantastical and grounding all at once.<br />It's a must-see for any quirky artist, or french-loving person.<br />I'll admit on the cover her picture kind of scares me, but she is Audrey Tautou adorable :]
B00009ZYC0|4.0|I remember when Minority Report first came out and it improved with a second viewing of the future.<br /><br />The future is an interesting place;  your advertising becomes personalized when you get eye scans upon walking into a store.  Advertising is really expansive.  And cars are automatic affairs running on rolling roads, reminiscent of Robert Heinlein's vision of \\"The Roads Must Roll\\" story.<br /><br />Anyway, Phillip K. Dick (Blade Runner) came up with a short story adapted to film about a six year experiment called the Pre Crime Unit -- clairvoyants floating in a tank who together come up with an agreed-upon vision of the future -- a future where they can predict murders.<br /><br />The pre crime cops jump on the murderers as they're about to commit a crime, after all the trio psychics are never wrong.  Or are they?<br /><br />There are people who greatly depend on this system and when John Anderton and a government agent stumble onto some anomalies in the system, they become targeted by these special interests.<br /><br />Spielberg spends a lot of time building up the Anderton character -- a man on drugs and greatly depressed on the disappearance of his son.  And divorced from a woman who could not stand the reminder of her son whenever she looked in Anderton's eyes.  Pretty sad.<br /><br />Lots of chases and lots of fighting with the occasional peak at the future make for some interesting science fiction entertainment -- but at two hours, wow!<br /><br />Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell both play their characters well though I would have liked to have seen more character development in Colin's character.<br /><br />Rental recommended!
0446582778|5.0|Yet another Harry Bosch novel written by Michael Connelly. I have to say that Connelly tells a great tale and he has developed Harry Bosch so well that I really feel like I know the guy. As always, it's a fast-paced novel that doesn't let you go.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has been a favorite of mine since she first hit the scene.  Her last CD, 19, is one of my favorite and most cherished discs, as is 21 now.  19 was fantastic and 21 is even better (which I didn't think was possible until I heard Rolling in the Deep).  This CD is ridiculously brilliant!  The lyrics, the music and of course her voice.  You will not be disappointed with this CD unless you don't like music.

1936719118|5.0|Derek Sivers started CDBaby as a simple way to sell his own CDs, and then CDs for friends.  Due to demand, good timing, and clever, intuitive business practices, Sivers built CDBaby in to a giant concern.    This book is very short. It's a set of little business lessons mixed in with Sivers' own experiences running CDBaby. In one sense it's an anti-business book, as some of its advice goes against maximizing profit. Sivers is more interested in doing interesting, useful work versus just doing things because they make money. He also has a fanatical devotion to customer service, which is in large part responsible for the company's success.    You can read \\"Anything You Want\\" in one sitting, and then come back to it later for inspiration. Additionally, the short animations which complement the book are very enjoyable to watch.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I do most of my reading at my cottage, where i don&apos;t have cell or internet.  This app won&apos;t save your spot in a book without a connection.

1590710037|3.0|You know, I should leave the review AFTER I've read the book, but for any of you who care about what the book may look like...before you spend almost 50 bucks you may want to know that this is a very small book, and if you order it from here you can be sure there is a sticker on it that is literally huge and irremovable without something that dissolves glue.      So much for appearances....once I get the sticker off of it (no easy feat as it is about the size of my hand) maybe I can write a review about the book itself.  Here's to hoping it's magical.
B004VQK9XW|5.0|Just downloaded this album and I have to say it is one of the best rock albums to come out in several years. Nikki Sixx is one of the greatest song writers in any genre of music, a true musical genius. Each song tells a story and it has everything you could want. You want a kick ass rock song? This Is Gonna Hurt takes care of that. Want a smooth cruisin song? Sure Feels Right's got you covered and if you want a heartfelt emotional song about the struggles of life? Skin is one of the best songs to come out in years. Cheers to Nikki and crew this just shows that The Heroin Diaries wasn't a fluke. Awesome album, you like rock, do yourself a favor and pick this album up.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|Edgardo's review<br />I was looking forward to this film for some time. It's been promoted in trailers and ads for some many months now. And it didn't disappoint. It certainly was better than Battlefield L.A, which was more or less a recruiting video for the army. Obviously, a cross-genre bending film like Cowboys and Aliens is always going to have believability issues. After all, six shooters and rifles, bows and arrows, Indian lances, and yes, a lariat, are going to seem a feeble offense against a race of evil aliens with interstellar technology. But it all comes together, sort of. And sort of is good enough. It never falls into campy, self-mockery. And that's all you can ask for.<br /><br />So, bulldogging a space fighter is very improbable, even impossible, and it's doubtful there were outlaw gangs 50 member strong lurking in the Arizona Territory A few other improbabilities are  lurking about in this film as well.<br /><br />But there is some very good acting going on here. It's always a pleasure to see Harrison Ford, and he makes the most of his role as the ex-army colonel turned Cattle Baron, Colonel Dolarhyde.<br />Daniel Craig made his big time actor bones reprising the screen action icon legend James Bond. He does a more than adequate job here. Harrison Ford brings some humanity to his role as the complex Colonel; at once caring and responsible, at other times ruthless and ice cold.<br />Olivia Wilde as the mysterious saloon girl plays an integral role here. She brings to all her work an air of inscrutability, leaving us wondering what lies behind that lovely visage. She conceals much, then when she reveals anything at all, its seems to be more of a revelation than it really is, in contrast to all her reticent air of mystery lead up.<br /><br />Adam Beach as Nat Colorado, semi-adopted son of Colonel Dolarhyde, gives a subtle performance; He straddles the cultural divide, and plays second-fiddle to Dolarhydes pusillanimous heir, a sniveling coward and bully. The audience really enjoys his comeuppance at the hands of Jake Lonergen (Daniel Craig).<br />The Arizona Desert (really it was filmed in New Mexico) is one of the stars here. One of the most important features of any Western is the locale. Without it, the movie could be an Eastern!<br />The canyons, rock formations, long vistas stretching for miles; cowboys, Indians, vaqueros, Apaches, prospectors, saloon girls, outlaws, barkeeps, what have you. We need these western types. It's been awhile since the last western; I can't reckon just when the last one was..<br />But I had a hankering for a whole heaping bowl of the stuff; and in that case Podner, it;'s been too long! (I'm channeling a brand of chili meat for some reason).<br />\\"Cowboys and Alens\\" came at the right time. Let's not quibble about believability and other such piddling stuff.<br /><br />The direction's more than up to snuff. Remember along with the special effects in the film , there are things blowing up left and right, there are real horses and of course humans. John Favreau directed Iron Man, and also there was executive producer input as well from Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard. And the aliens were quite decent.<br />All in all, give it 4 stars out of 5.his comeuppance at the hands of Jake Lonergen (Daniel Craig).

It's been awhile since the last western; I can't reckon just when the last one was..   But I had a hankering for a whole heaping bowl of the stuff; and in that case Podner, it;'s been too long! (I'm channeling a brand of chili meat for some reason).  \\"Cowboys and Alens\\" came at the right time. Let's not quibble about believability and other such piddling stuff.     The direction's more than up to snuff. Remember along with the special effects in the film , there are things blowing up left and right, there are real horses and of course humans. John Favreau directed Iron Man, and also there was executive producer input as well from Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard. And the aliens were quite decent.   All in all, give it 4 stars out of 5.
B0034KZE9U|1.0|I've worn Croc knockoffs for years, and really wanted a pair of the real thing. so, I had found a pair of them, similar to these, but with vents along the sides, sent the link to my husband, who ordered them. What we got were these, in brown, too small, and without vents. I wrote a note, put it in the box with the shoes, and we returned them, expecting the situation to be rectified. Nope....all we got was the SAME style, same colour, a larger size, and STILL no vents.<br /><br />These things are hot, which make my feet swell, and I have to take them off in less than an hour of wearing them in our air conditioned house. They are useless to me, and I am very disappointed with the company that sold them, Shoe Station.

B002HMHROQ|3.0|Upon its release, \\"The Blue Mask\\" was meant to signal the beginning of a new phase in Reed's music (the sober one) as well as a return to form in his songwriting. It certainly is the first but falls short on the second count.     Reed spends a considerable amount of time rediscovering traditional values (home, love, marriage!) and villifying both booze and drugs. Lyrically, then, the air is often heavy with conservative cliches and humorless observations. Musically, however, Reed doesn't botch the whole thing. The title track, \\"My House,\\" and \\"The Gun\\" reflect brilliant songwriting that is also successful in changing the style which had driven him to a musical standstill in the late 70's. Here is a bones and flesh approach whose directness and simplicity only highlight the virtues of the songs. Robert Quine is particularly provocative in developing a guitar sound that is both sparse and harrowing at times. The same goes for the standout (and sometimes Pastorius-like) bass playing of Fernando Saunders. His interplay with the guitars is pivotal in moving the songs in the right direction.     Having said this, the rest of the songwriting is lackluster and sometimes embarrassingly schmaltzy, as is the case with \\"Heavenly Arms,\\" a song even Stevie Wonder wouldn't sing without cringing. In fact, stylistic developments aside, this album is really no better than the two previous erratic albums put out by Reed, both of which suffer from the same inconsistency.     It is a matter of some wonder that much of Reed's material should be so overrated by fans who seem more fascinated by his dark past. And it is a matter of some irony that they should continue to overrate the man for the same reasons after he condemns his past in their face.  Go figure.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|I got to tell ya.... I have listened to this new album 20+ times... OMG.... Listen people... give it a chance... it's so deep.... Put it on  your iPod.... go for a walk... (at night)... FABULOUS... the songs \\"talk\\" to you.... Listen.... Don't say \\"where has the magic gone?'.... It's right here... Listen... Awesome CD..... 10 Stars....!!!!!  I feel it... Didn't like it the first time I listened... Give it a chance... you will LOVE it!!!
B001EOOQEM|5.0|Heaven & Hell is very possibly the best metal album ever made. It is definitly the best Black Sabbath album ever made. Ozzy is great but if you listen to him next to Ronnie there is no comparison. I have a lot of metal albums and the ones I find myself listening to over and over again are the ones that include Ronnie (especially when he's singing with Black Sabbath.)If you're a fan of Ronnie, Black Sabbath, or metal you should absolutly buy this.
0670022411|4.0|I felt like I put more into this book than I got out of it. A Discovery of Witches is littered with extra details and small plotlines that need not be included. Cutting those out (and consequently dropping about 100 pages) would have helped. The premise here was great, but the execution was just so-so, and the ending was terribly flat. For the amount of time it took me to read this, I'm not sure I'd recommend it.

B003TXKSWK|5.0|The Roots have always outdone themselves through every album. Wake Up! has a richness of soul. The sounds in this album blend beautifully with John's voice. The messages thoughout every song speaks to the people while making us move. Thank you Roots for always giving us great music!
B003956Z8O|5.0|Like people have previously mentioned, this is an ALBUM, not just some catchy singles. While Oracular is quite good, MGMT has expanded their sound here, and to people who listen to the radio and mainstream music, Congratulations will take a few plays before you get hooked. There really isn't a bad song on the album, and Siberian Breaks is a masterpiece.
B0024Y7H10|5.0|I never got a chance to see the tv series when it aired because of other activities I had but I've been able to finally catch up with both seasons.  I hate that the series got cancelled after the second season I was a terminator fan and really looking forward to season three some day.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|You own the VHS, Laserdisc, DVDs, cool you're a fan and you can choose whether to buy this or not.  I used to despise the altered Original Trilogy as I get older I do accept why GL has done it, continuity with the prequels and he was never really satisfied with what he created, I'm sure creative people here can relate to that whether a book a piece of music, a piece of art you've maybe revisited with what you know now and have improved upon it, nothing wrong with that.  I'll buy these in a heartbeat, just like I bought a new car when my old one needed some improvement i.e. GPS, iPhone Dock etc and my new mac when the last one died.  You have the choice to buy this or not but moaning about this and that, just a waste of time, enjoy your life you're free, may the force be with ya.
0061353248|5.0|After reading this book you'll look at your own decisions in a whole new way. It's very interesting to learn that seemingly unrelated things can affect what we do, and perhaps more importantly, how we spend our money. I myself am guilty of doing several of the things talked about in this book. Like I would take free things without realizing that it really costing me an opportunity to get something better.    There are tons of things that you can learn from reading this book that will help you make better decisions, and you will enjoy reading every page of it.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|this app should help you to type faster if u make a lot of mistakes typing but unfortunately it is just full of too many bugs and runs like crap on my htc thunderbolt. maybe ill try the app again after I root my phone but for now it doesn&apos;t work as described.

1439152799|3.0|Secrets of the past whisper through \\"The Distant Hours\\" creating a tale full of mystery.<br /><br />This gothic tale begins in 1992 with a letter from the past coming to Meredith from 50 years before, creating many questions and unexplained emotions for her daughter, Edith. Come on this journey as it weaves among the decades to uncover all the secrets that have been hidden since the evacuation days of WWII. Discover how the Sisters Blythe lives all began and the twists and turns that spiraled through the years as they spent their days at Milderhurst Castle. Listen to the secrets that reveal themselves bit by bit as Edie unravels the mysteries that lie inside those stone-cold walls. Can you hear the whispers? Can you feel the lost loves and unspoken longings?<br /><br />I have to admit this book moved very slowly for me. I enjoyed reading the descriptions and imagining in my mind's eye the gothic settings around the castle, but the story itself just didn't take off at the beginning like I would have liked. About midway through, it did pick up, so then it was better.<br /><br />Kate Morton is a new author to me, so I would like to read some more of her work. I have read about her other novel, \\" The Forgotten Garden\\" and I would very much like to see what it is like.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a gothic tale that is full of history, mystery, and lost loves.<br /><br />This book was provided to me through Goodreads first reads and this is my honest review.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|I have to say, aside from all the panty shots and ridiculous boob bouncing (sound effects included) this anime was amazing. The action and animation is superb and the story is very convincing. I thought the girls in the bathroom scene was hilarious and i have found alot of the crude humor to be very lightening. Now i will admit some of this is so ridiculous, like a bullet doing the matrix between a pair of boobs but i think this anime is a great change. Only problem with this collection is that the OVA is not included in it. I reccomend this whole heartedly however i think this is an anime you save up for and not make an impulse buy. I mena it is $40 for 12 episodes. Kinda close to, too expensive but it's worth it in the end.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The first three books were fantastic. You know why? Stuff happened. Now Martin is too lost in his own mythology. I used to worry if Martin would ever finish the series. Now I wonder if that might not be a good thing. I hope the series gets back on track and doesn't keep us waiting 5 years for another book where nothing happens. As it is, I'm starting to lose all faith in what started as a very promising series.
B005BW0TO4|5.0|I can listen to this over and over, everyone in the family likes it too not just mom and dad
0553801473|2.0|Loved the first 3 books, but NOTHING is happening in this series.  The last few books have been nothing but characters sailing or riding from one location to another.  That's it.  Not a single thing was resolved in this massive book.  Just a total story failure on every level.  Sucks.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|what can you possible feel after reading this book? Nothing like this must happen! I started the book but I skipped a lot of parts because it was too painful. It s impossible to think how many years she had to stay with them before the freedom. Now she is with her family alive this is all that matters now! a huge hug jaycee!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Shantaram is one of those very rare books that grasps life and love, good and evil, friendship and betrayal.  It is a stupendous adventure, rich in action, color, and emotion.  It is a modern epic.

159448385X|5.0|I have read this book twice now and have been amazed each time what I can see and feel about the life that is portrayed in Afghanistan from this book. I am sharing it with friends and relatives as I know they will be intrigued by it also. It's a book that is hard to put down.
B004PEJ1H0|5.0|As usual, George Michael makes a song his own by putting his voice to it!  Great interpretation of a good song!  I think he just made it better!  I think George Michael needs to get to work and create some new ear candy for all of us out there missing his incredible voice, not to mention his sexiness that just gets better as he ages.  More!  More! More, George!
0316017930|5.0|This book was a very quick read-- time well spent.  It teaches that the keys to success are not necessarily talent or intelligence, but opportunity, personality, practice, and serendipity.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|Very good film that has an interesting ending. Good acting, flow and drama that holds your attention throughout the movie!
0345529057|5.0|I cannot say enough abou George R.R. Martin's writing.  I have been a longtime fan of Robert Jordan's A Wheel of Time series, and I had just planned to read the first book in this series to pass the time until A Memory of Light (last book in the other series) was released.  I ended up liking it so much I purchased this four book package and the fifth book that was released last month.    His writing is unique in that there aren't really established 'sides' - no good vs evil, creator vs satan, etc.  You may hate a character by the end of book one, and come to love that same character by the end of book 3.  There are a lot of twists!
B005BZQVJ8|3.0|To be perfectly honest, I had higher expectations for this movie given that it stars the classic dynamic duo of Pegg and Frost, but I was somewhat slightly disappointed. I think the potential of the idea of a couple of British space geeks travelling to the US for a comic convention and coming across a real live space alien could have really been a side splitter! Don't get me wrong there are parts where it was funny, but I guess I came into this movie with my own preconceptions because to the two star actors' track records.     For me, the character of Paul and his behaviour is true to character, in the sense that you would expect that kind of behaviour from an alien who has been living amongst people in a secret base somewhere for so many years... he's gotten slightly comfortable with human culture and understands the human mindset. Not sure I liked Seth Rogan voicing Paul... I think there are better voices out there... can't really name any right now, but if I really give it a think I'm sure I could come up with a few. Is it just me or is Paul slightly obsessed with showing his family jewels?     Not sure I really liked or understood the scenes where Nick Frost is jealous of Paul for spending time with his best mate Simon Pegg, he's straight and he's jealous of another alien guy for spending time with his mate? Huh!? (upset, feeling let down, lonely, abandoned these I can understand)     I did enjoy Kristen Wiig's character where she wants to break free and live freely, but is completely new to the whole thing... it's funny where she tries to curse.     One tiff I can't seem to get over with this movie is that it is, in a sense, blasphemous... evolution! There is clear and obvious swipe at religion in this movie which I did not appreciate.     Overall a funny movie, but if you really want to enjoy it you have to forget all preconceptions, especially those relating to movies like Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz. Again, funny but not laugh out loud funny.
B004LROMSO|1.0|This could have been a good series, but the acting is just dreadful. In particular the actor who plays Arthur is really terrible. The writing isn't much better. I like the costumes and the sets, but I can only spend so long looking at those...
B0002MJT0I|4.0|I first saw this movie on my honeymoon in a resort... yeah not exactly the most romantic movie to see whilst on your honeymoon, I know. This is the movie that got me switched on to the whole Simon Pegg and Nick Frost combo (having never seen the so much talked about Spaced). I have to admit that I bought the DVD because I was feeling a bit nostalgic.<br /><br />This movie is a comedy / horror movie (weird combo) but trust me it does work... I find the comedy style in most Simon Pegg movies to be refreshing and somewhat subtle when compared to the in your face slapstick Hollywood comedic styles. Come to think of it there is a bit carried over from this movie to the movie [[ASIN:B000RJO578 Hot Fuzz (Widescreen Edition)]].. the morning sequence (where Shaun gets up in the morning and goes through his daily rituals in fast sequence of shots) and Ed's `Yeah Boooyyyyyyy!' Not that it takes anything away from either of the two movies. I tend to find Hot Fuzz funnier than this one, but this is still a funny movie.<br /><br />I have to agree with the other reviews when they say that there scenes with quite a bit of realistic gore in them that might make people cringe. Also, there is slight amount of profanity in the movie... but it shouldn't be too much of a problem as the kids will not be around to watch this one for sure!<br /><br />All in all a funny movie with a change from American style comedies and it kind of has compromise ending in the end where it isn't the happiest ending in the world, but at least everyone is sort of happy where they are!
B000683VI4|5.0|I loved this movie from start to finish.  I never read the book and now am interested in finding that too as the books are usually always better than the movie.    Okay, I only have one minor problem with this movie.    Towards the middle of the movie the rich snobbish mother reveals a secret to allie; that she too fell in love with someone from the other side of the tracks and also gave him up for someone that was better off.  So why than, after being through the same thing herself, wouldnt she be more understanding about her daughter and encourage her instead of trying to end her daughter's relationship.  This makes no sense to me.  It seems the father is more understanding than the mother and you would think it would be the other way around.    But still a great movie.  A real tear jerker
B003Y5H574|5.0|Looks like I'm just another of several to give this romantic comedy 5-stars. Crazy, Stupid, Love isn't your traditional romantic comedy. You can tell this when Julianne Moore tells Steve Carrell, her husband of almost 25 years, that she wants a divorce. From there, the movie breaks off into parts, following Carrell as he hits the singles scene and fails miserably until being aided by hilarious ladies man Ryan Gosling. This movie is more about finding lost love again after losing it.<br /><br />Gosling spends weeks tutoring Carrell on how to pick up women, while his ex-wife is struggling with her own choice to break up her marriage by having an affair with a coworker played by Kevin Bacon. Meanwhile, Carrell and Moore's 13 year old son has a crush on his cute 17-year old baby sitter. She however, isn't returning his love, because she has a crush on an older man. Emma Stone plays a young law student about to pass the bar exam, and being wooed by a nerdy boyfriend (Josh Groban) and ignoring the advances of Gosling. Sounds complicated? Well its really quite simple as the movie follows how crazy and stupid love can be as the characters try and find their one true soul mate.<br /><br />The movie is really good because of the strong cast. Each plays their part perfectly and there are lot of laughs, especially at the few twists at the end. The climax at the 8th grade graduation could have been handled better, but overall I really liked this movie. The triangle between the babysitter, the older man and the kid had a few moments that I believed cross the line (issues involving sexting) but this is a movie for adults, so kids shouldn't be seeing it anyway.<br /><br />As Steve Carrell moves past his successful stint on THE OFFICE, I hope he will make more movies like this.
0439023521|5.0|When I first heard about this book, the plot sounded derivative, already used in books like Ender's Game and Surviving Antarctica. I kept hearing so much good buzz about it that I went ahead and read it anyway. The plot is derivative, but with the book's great characters and a heavy dose of hearty action, The Hunger Games is a strong read. Like most dystopian novels, this one pushes the warning buttons on the reader's brain and sends your brain synapses a jolt that keeps the reader thinking long past the close of the book. I'm looking forward to book two. (JMHO, but I can't see this book in libraries with younger readers. Lots of violence.)
B0057A6GA6|4.0|Very fun game and very addicting. Some of the items seem to cost too much though. Game money, not real money.
0143036742|4.0|Two sisters and their elderly father collide as they have always collided in the past but with tremendous force and great frequency when the elderly father falls for a young woman who wants to immigrate to England from Ukraine. The dialogue is clever and fun and painful and the dad's obsession with tractors is a nice sidebar to the story.
B0011N1WE8|3.0|It's a simple love story of a guy lost in the world who gambles non-stop to fill the empty void in his life and BLAH BLAH BLLAH... and a girl with a pigs nose who needs to marry a blue blood(rich guy) in order to break the curse yadda yadda *yawn*...<br />One of \\"those\\" fairy tale love stories that is short but sweet. If you hate corniness, love, and anything related to fairy tales stay away from this one. You've been warned... (O__o)
1451629184|5.0|Easy to read, moving, descriptive story of Jaycee's formative years as an abducted child.  She is a very special person to have survived and returned, assuming her role in life as a daughter, sister and parent.  Certainly, her story will be an inspiration to others who may be lucky enough to survive an abduction.  Perhaps also inspiration for all neighborhoods to be alert to the actions of those who inhabit them.

B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is the best alarm clock I ever got. I&apos;m terrible at hearing my alarm (I slept through a fire alarm in a hotel). Yet this alarm wakes me up every time, though the easy math problems are kind of hard when you&apos;re still asleep :-)
B000HIVOFU|2.0|There is not much doubt about the high quality recordings on this disc, but surely we need more than that.  Most of the featured artists left me cold and unimpressed.  There are far better SACD options out there. A wasted opportunity.
B005DD7H50|5.0|I liked this movie.  It is a fantasy, although there are resemblances to reality.  Bradley Coopers' character Edward has a writer's block and can't seem to make any progress on his book.  His brother in law gives him a drug that enables him to use 100% of his brain as opposed to 10% or 20%.  If the person was already intelligent, the drug enables the person to organize and access all information in his brain at will.  It also enhances creativity.<br /><br />There aren't a whole lot of special effects, but the plot is interesting.  All of a sudden, this drug opens up a lot of possibilities for him that did not exist before.<br /><br />It is hard not to notice parallels to reality with drug addicts: withdrawal symptoms, extra energy, heightened senses, and accelerated ageing of the body.<br /><br />** SPOILER **<br />Toward the end of the movie, we learn that he used an enhanced version of the drug that did not have any side effects, and after a limited period of use, enabled him to use 100% of his brain without any further use of any drug.  In reality if such a drug was available, why would anybody not use it?  It seems to me like no-brainer, except if there was any *unknown* side effects to be discovered.<br /><br />Great acting, great cast, great movie.  Highly recommended.

044651506X|5.0|As usual Plum Island was excellent as all of Ken Follett books are.  I'm now reading The Man from St. Petersburg and it is excellent also.  I like the fact that I write to him and he answers.      I work for USDA and Plum Island is a part of our organization so it was so neat to read about it.  I was only there once and didn't get to go into all the depts that they characters got to go - we just went to the Admin part.
1451629184|5.0|One of the most amazing stories of modern times was Jaycee Dugard and her eighteen years of captivity.  When headlines heralded the news of how the local police \\"found\\" her and how she reunited with her family, everyone wanted to know the same thing: \\"How did she get through all of that?\\"    Her interview with Diane Sawyer on an ABC News special revealed Jaycee to be a lovely young woman with a special type of courage.  Cleverly timed to coincide with the release of \\"A Stolen Life,\\" it was nevertheless the story on people's minds since August of 2009.    The book reads extremely quickly.  Since it is so compelling and written in a spare (though often hauntingly lyrical) style, and it is not overlong, it is possible to read the book in one day.  Many reviewers report doing just this.  Early on, the book gets emotionally difficult in the weeks and months immediately following Jaycee's capture.  Without giving too many details away, people treat dogs better than she was treated.  The raw sexual details are revealed without blinking.  As readers we find out about the frequency and the length of Phillip Garrido's assaults on Jaycee's youth.      Every single question observers may have about Jaycee's plight are answered throughout her book.  How did she deal with the boredom and loneliness?  She became extraordinarily involved with her pets (wouldn't you have?)  She wrote journals and shares them with the reader, set on the pages as a copy from her own hand.  How did she give birth to two baby girls without medical assistance?  She goes into details about that, too.  At the end of the book, it is even revealed that both she and her daughters managed to stay healthy in every aspect without years of any medical or dental care.    It is apparent that Jaycee ferociously protects the privacy of her daughters.  Their names are never revealed and the details of their early development are only glanced upon.  This led some reviewers to erroneously conclude that Jaycee cared moreabout her pets than about her children!  Yet nothing is farther from the truth.    Jaycee Dugard has set up a foundation called JAYC (just ask yourself to care) which will help families dealing with reunification in circumstances similar to hers, and to families who have suffered other traumas along those lines.  And whether she knows it or not, her story stands as a metaphor for all the imprisoned, alienated, and violated of us and how we muster the courage to persevere.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|Wild movie did not know how it was going to go. First try to figure out how they were doing it but when you figure it out blows the mind. Real good movie action non-stop & loved the way it ended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I gotta say I just loved this book. Very good and enjoyable read. Once into the book I had it read by the end of the day! lol
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's listed as directed mainly to the younger set, but it's definitely a for-all-ages book. I can't wait for the movie and really hope the author finds a way to do some prequel books to keep this series going. My only beef was the last few sentences on how it was left in definitive closure at the end of the 3rd book of the series.  I would love for the 4th book in the series to be a prequel to the events and stories leading up to the very first Hunger Games. I have already read Catching Fire and Mockingjay and loved those as well. It's been many years since I can recommend a book and series as strongly as I do this one.
B004UA8D1O|2.0|I'll comment on both the movie (all that I could stand to watch) and the 3D aspect of the film....    first the movie storyline...  Me, I didn't like the movie at all....  I disliked soo much, I didn't even finish watching it...  IMO, it was depressing!!!!  maybe I just don't like watching a group of people slowly going to their watery grave by drowning, but, it just wasn't something I could not stand...  moreover, none of the characters were likable, the seemed timid, selfish and somewhat stupid...  except for the father and he just seemed wierd....  Maybe it was the acting, maybe he was supposed to be brave and fearless, IMO, he just came across as being a jerk....  and that son... man, I wanted to slap some sense AND a spine into him myself....     now, for the 3Dness...  I really couldn't see it....  IMO, it is a waste of money to watch in 3D...  as long as you watch either in HD or w/ Blu Ray, I think you'd get the effect of the scenery....    final verdict, I suggest renting first before you buy....  you maybe like me (and quite a few others) and just not like it enough to watch the entire movie let alone purchase it!!!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book is now one of my favorite books. Worth buying i didnt feel like anything was left out some parts were annoying but it all smoothed out in the end.
031603441X|5.0|I'm a Stones fan but early on I realized I was actually more of a Keith Richards fan. Maybe non fans won't see this book the same way I did, but I loved it. While reading this, I couldn't help think of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. When I first heard about that Disneyland ride as a basis for a movie, a long movie, I thought, how stupid. But the movie turns out to be pretty entertaining and the reason is that Johnny Depp gives an amazing and strangely charismatic performance as Jack Sparrow. Reading this book, I realized that Keith Richards *is* Jack Sparrow. When you think of \\"pirates\\" there are the bad kind, the real kind, which you might find off the coast of Somalia and then there are the romanticized ones who never existed. The closest you'll get is Keith Richards. And it's not just me. In the book I counted at least ten incidental allusions to pirates. Listen to the last few seconds of Keith's song \\"Struggle\\"; you'd swear that's Jack Sparrow. To see Depp playing Sparrow is entertaining; to realize that it's based on a real dude whose life is no less improbable is quite something else. Simple scriptwriting keeps Sparrow alive (or at least coming back from the dead). Keith's ability to remain with the living is a genuine string of swashbuckling miracles.<br /><br />I usually don't get too much into celebrity gossip, but Keith's life is really not your typical celebrity. His goals seem to be different. He's not your average publicity whore. He does actually seem to really be most concerned about music. I personally hear that on his records, but the book contextualizes it nicely. I appreciated the discussion about his distinctive sound which, for its simplicity, is quite difficult to reproduce. As Keith says, without the right guitar tuning (GDGBD) \\"...it just won't work.\\"<br /><br />I thought the book was quite well crafted. The other author did a fine job keeping everything organized and flowing. The only odd thing about it was that there was an \\"About the Author\\" section. Uh, wasn't that what we just spent 500+ pages reading? But overall, very cool.n. Uh, wasn't that what we just spent 500+ pages reading? But overall, very cool.

1451629184|4.0|This book evokes many emotions as you will discover while reading. What an awful way to have to spend so much of your life but what can you do but deal with whatever happens in life.  My main reason for buying this book wasn't to know what horrible things she went through but it was in hopes that the money that I paid would help her and her girls to get a start in the real world on their own. I hope that the publishers reward her well; she deserves it. May God bless Jaycee, her mom, and all who loved, believed and stayed strong with hope that things would finally turn out the way that they did.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|My favorite books have alpha male heroes that are possessive and obsessive of the herione. In addition, I like my stories HOT!!! I was originally weary of reading this book b/c it is YA. However, I kept hearing such great things about it that I finally gave in and read it. BOY OH BOY!!! This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time and believe me I know my books. I have been an avid reader for 9 years and have read over 2000 books. When I say this is one of the best books I've read, I mean it. The hero, Travis, is the ideal male that every girl dreams of. While I did not really like the herione so much, it did not diminish my love for this story. This is a MUST READ!!! You will not regret it. I will read this book over and over again.
1594744769|5.0|Ransom Riggs has written a wonderful fantasy inspired by old photos about peculiar children living in a time loop.  The photos add authenticity to the story so the fatasy becomes very real to the reader.  Best read if you do ot look ahead at the photos but allow them to illustrate as the plot develops.  Recommend for teens or adult.

0439023521|3.0|I sped through the book, primarily because it's an easy read. I liked the premise, and I wanted to like Katniss. Along the way, she kept letting me down. The juxtaposition between very capable self-sufficient hunter and the girl who can't say yes, or no, didn't match up. Perhaps the author was trying to convey a complicated personality. It comes off as two personalities jammed into the same girl.  As an adventure novel, it's fine.  I read a lot. Many of today's adventure and mystery fiction consists of pages of characters asking questions, what if this? suppose that? maybe the other? I call it filler. The author needs to add more words, so he/she does it with filler. It doesn't move the story along, it does add more pages.  In the movies, they do it with endless chase scenes. You don't have to write interesting, funny or entertaining dialogue if you can spend ten minutes at a stretch banging up cars.   I understand from reviews of the next two books, that Katniss continues her `maybe this, maybe not, maybe, maybe, maybe' hand-wringing dithering. How she can be so indecisive and survive in that world doesn't compute. My trilogy stops at one.
1936719118|5.0|The main emphasis I would make from the get-go, was that I was entertained from the first page to the last.<br />Derek's ride through the business world - which was only meant to be a fun hobby at first - is narrated in a very engaging way in this small book.  In his own words, he discusses not only the various events and decisions that went into his growing of CD Baby, but also how he refused to allow the small-minded, scarcity-consciousness urgings of the business lawyers who urged him to take precautions to protect himself (the kind of legal precautions that annoy or push away customers ..)<br /><br /> As well, he ignored \\"marketing gurus\\" who insisted that he is losing money because he didn't plaster advertisements on his site.  It was *his* business, and that's not what he wanted. He was simply running his business to help independent musicians, that's it. He wasn't in it for the money - he was in it to do what he loved, and to help others.<br /><br /> As just stated, I enjoyed reading how he insisted on asserting his own right to run his business as he saw fit, not having to answer to anyone, and just make everything he did, an expression of just pure fun and joy and of making friends with his own customers through entertaining emails, and company policies that customers got a kick out of.<br /><br /> You could tell that Derek wasn't trying to prepare the message in this book to convey some kind of I'm-an-expert-listen-to-my-business advice.. he was simply telling an entertaining story about a business he ran, that at the same gives you an insight in his personal values, and that will end up being a set of principles summed up that you will re-read to remind yourself how to engage customers and spread the viral message of your product/service as powerfully as Derek did.<br /><br />Some Siver-isms:<br /> - When someone's doing something for the money, people can sense it, like a desperate lover. It's a turnoff.<br /><br />- When someone's doing something for love, being generous instead of stingy, trusting instead of fearful, it triggers this law: We want to give to those who give.<br /><br />- When you set up your business like you don't need the money, people are happier to pay you.f fearful, it triggers this law: We want to give to those who give.  - When you set up your business like you don't need the money, people are happier to pay you.
B002ZG9940|2.0|I just finished this movie and I can't remember about 80 of the 90 minutes of it.    And even then, the ten minutes I do recall have mostly to do with how impeccably impeccable everybody's hair is.    It's soooo serious.  The dialog soooo short.  Every camera shot is not just wide, it's soooo wide.  The girls all soooo alike.  And the movie, by result, is soooo boring.  But he's a killer and the corridors are green at night, soooo it has to be interesting, right?    George Clooney is a great deal more unbelievable in his seemingly twilight years take on Tom Cruise's assassin from Collateral.  It feels as if Clooney is approaching this role as some off broadway workshop.  He isn't \\"reserved,\\"  no he is completely nonexistent.  Clooney made his name playing the likeable middle aged working stiff.  The ladies man at night, but busting his butt for a dime.  Don't mistake that for thinking he has \\"disappeared\\" in his role - he is completely forgettable, moving from one strangely out place sex scene to the next.  He must have been watching a lot of Michael Mann when he took this one - because if he isn't trying to ape Cruise, he's mirroring, to the best of his meager ability, de Niro's dance in Mann's Heat. Only in Syriana did George stretch his limits, and even then appropriately so.    But I'm being kind here.  Most of the blame for this goes to Corbijn.  If Clooney is anonymous on the call sheet, the director is MIA.    Anton Corbijn's celebrity photography have done him no favors here.  Why would they? Most of his portraiture lacked any real connection and this movie, he shows no interest, connection or insight into any character in the frame.  But hey, they spent hours getting the gel balance right on all those night corridors.  Though he directed a movie named Control - he obviously had none during the filming of this movie.  It feels as if all the calls were from Clooney from beginning to end.  Corbijn may have some photographic vision, but he has no perception onwhat it takes to guide a story in motion.    At least he used a Hasselblad for his still work.
0307271862|1.0|A really interesting premise totally disemboweled by horrible character dialogue (and idiotic internal character monologues) and ridiculous coincidences that require so much suspension of disbelief that I wouldn't be surprised if unicorns were introduced to the storyline at some point. I wouldn't know, I stopped reading after 286 painful pages. Would love to meet the translator so I could Stooge-slap her for unleashing this trite crap on the masses, would also like to Stooge-slap the book reviewer at the Daily Beast for making me want to read this. If anyone can wrap up the whodunit for me in a sentence or two, please do, because I would kind of still like to know what happens, but I can't bear to pick the book up again.

0802130208|3.0|Try as I might, I could not enjoy this novel. It came highly recommended to me. I just found Ignatius slothful, overly onanistic, self-righteous, and elitist. I kept waiting for some great revelation or some insightful commentary, but I was left with the feeling that I had spent too much time with a man who I would never want to know in real life. Ignatius was sold to me by the person who recommended the book as a modern Don Quixote, but I found none of Quixote's endearing character traits in Ignatius. There was something noble about Don Quixote's blind devotion to his quest. I can't recall anything noble about Ignatius. Maybe that was Toole's point. Maybe his novel is a commentary on modern man's wretched condition.  If so, I was too disgusted with Ignatius to notice.

0553801473|2.0|In general this particular book really is lousy.  The Author no longer has a clue how to edit himself and it is just rambling for large parts of the book.<br /><br />  As an example instead of taking a sentence or two to reveal that someone was seen while taking out the trash he would spend 9 pages of rambling pointless text to have the same revealed.<br /><br />  There is a reason why most authors do not go beyond 250 or so pages for a book... the pacing is so much better!<br /><br />-> Even if this was edited down to half the 957 pages it still is would be disapointing.<br /><br />  I will not say anything that is a spoiler....  But trust me this is his worst book in the series yet by far!

B003Y5H57E|5.0|Let me start off my review of this film by saying that I hate Steve Carrell. Watching him on \\"The Office\\" for all those years was painful, because his character, and it seemed his acting style was unbelievably stupid and bland. While he has occasionally been a decent funnyman, I hadn't seen him in a role where he was remotely interesting and believable.    Yesterday, I was at the movies, pretty much the whole day, and decided to check out \\"Crazy Stupid Love\\", because it had decent critical and audience reactions, better than I expected for a romantic comedy, and it had some of my favorite people in it, including Julianne Moore, Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. And, to say the least, I was caught by surprise.    One of the reasons for this, is because \\"Crazy Stupid Love\\" works as a romantic comedy and a drama. Most romantic comedies, I find, are predictable, stale, and essentially one carbon copy after another, of the same exact story, played out in a slightly altered way. You probably won't guess where \\"Crazy Stupid Love\\" is going. While the ending itself is alot like I predicted it, there's a big plot twist that presents itself in the climax that I really didn't see coming. And that's reason enough to see this movie.    However, there are many (better) reasons. One of the big reasons is that it avoids making any of its characters caricatures. Each character is real, and flawed, screwed up and deals with his or her problems in a very grounded and grown-up way.     It revolves around Cal (Carell), a man who has been married to Emily (Moore) for 25 years, and is rocked by the revelation that she wants a divorce, after sleeping with a co-worker (Kevin Bacon). Cal begins hanging out at a chic pickup bar, where he meets Jacob (Ryan Gosling), a lothario who takes a different woman home every night. He picks up on Cal's depression, and helps him turn into something of a womanizer. Meanwhile, Cal's floppy-haired thirteen-year-old son Robbie has a crush on his older babysitter,who has a little crush of her own. Also, Jacob meets Hannah (Emma Stone), a young lawyer who has heard every pickup line, and therefore, has a quite jaded outlook on love.    And it is the first film or TV show to portray Steve Carrell as a human being. He can act! Who knew? I actually liked him in this role, because I felt that he wasn't Michael Scott, or that guy from \\"Get Smart\\", or \\"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\\", but an average guy whose life didn't turn out as he had hoped. I bought him in this role. He more than keeps up with the rest of the film's stellar cast.    Another revelation here is Ryan Gosling. I've mostly seen him in depressing dramatic roles (\\"Blue Valentine\\", \\"The Notebook\\"), while here, he proves himself to be a cunning comedian. He has spectacular comedic timing, and clearly has a lot of fun here with the other actors. He seems to be the superficial funnyman at first, and, like the rest of the cast in this terrific film, opens up, and surprises the audience.    While Julianne Moore is always great, her character and Carrell's character mesh in a way that makes you believe that their marriage lasted 20+ years. Emma Stone is on fire right now, doing a great role in \\"The Help\\", she shines just as much here, if not more. Her character is instantly lovable, and I can't wait to see what she does next.     This film also features Marisa Tomei, who gives a fierce, and very funny performance as a recovering alcoholic schoolteacher who dates Cal for awhile after his divorce. Kevin Bacon also made me laugh, as Emily's co-worker, who was her post-divorce rebound. While these two have brief roles, they are very funny and make the most of what they are given.    What makes this film memorable for me, is that it is realistic. It doesn't paint love out to be this magical thing that will automatically make anyone happy. It knows that love doesn't always work out, and occasionally ends in heartbreak and/or violence. And while it's somewhat a cautionary tale, it ends hopefully and overall, kind of happily. It made me cry a little, and it made me laugh a lot. And while it could have been a bit longer, and given its characters some more room to grow, it was a satisfying overall package that I would recommend to someone who's trying to escape the summer of superhero flicks and sequels.
0525951652|4.0|Another great story from Ken Follett!  A great combination of real history and fiction to make a page turning read.  The characters are well drawn, and you become involved with each and everyone of them.  You go through the important moments of the first world war, enthralled with the dynamics of the world situation, down to the personal level.  I loved every moment of the book, and I look forward to next part of this tilogy.

B000H6SXMY|1.0|I was really excited to get this box set, because I love the show.  However, upon opening it, the case they come in was severely beat up.  Literally falling apart.  I was refunded 20% because of this, which I appreciated.  Now that I have had a chance to start watching the DVD's I have realized the poor quality didn't stop at the box.  Some of the DVD's won't even play! Some will play but a few of the episodes on the disc will not play at all.  I think when you are spending this much on something it should at least work.  Very disappointing!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love this set of books - best fantasy in quite a while. Everytime I think I know whats going to happen - something different happens.

B004ASOVWQ|4.0|For me, this is another one of the books that points out the bleeding obvious. I mean that more in the sense that it is something I know but really haven't taken the time to understand or fully appreciate. This book has succeeded in making me think much deeper about the power of scale, especially when it come to the Internet.<br /><br />In a world obsessed with the next big hit or the single shining light this book demonstrates that much success lies in satisfying the diversity of choice. Too often popular culture seduces into a popularity contest where there is only room for first place. Too often we fail to celebrate the diversity of interests that is humanity and fail to take business advantage of this.<br /><br />The ability to reach smaller audiences has now been simplified with technology and the Internet. Now it is possible to services just about every market as quickly and easily as any traditional business model. This book opened my eyes up to the possibilities that I have been largely ignoring and has infused a desire to explore such opportunities with more rigour and discipline.<br /><br />If you are looking to understand the business opportunity technology like the Internet can provide a business. If you are looking to understand how to succeed even within a restricted audience, then this book is something you should read. In reality, if you are in business then this is certainly a book that you should read as it may just change your idea of where you can be successful. I know it has for me.
0062515675|4.0|Since I mentioned Robin Sharma and \\"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari\\" in my latest video on my website (August 2011), people have asked me about his book. It was one of the first books that I read and recognized as spiritual fiction. The subtitle of this book is \\" a fable about fulfilling your dreams and reaching your destiny\\", and it truly is a fable and totally fictional. Initially when I read it I thought it was a true story until some of the things that happened to the lawyer Julian just seemed impossible to believe. I was really in the infancy of my spirituality at the time, however this story did get me hooked.<br /><br />This fable is about a very successful lawyer named Julian Mantle who is stricken by a massive heart attack in the middle of a packed courtroom. One of his proteges, John, is there to witness the big man crumple to the ground, and the story progresses from there. The author provides you with a detailed background of the circumstances leading up to Julian's heart attack, and you are then fast-forwarded to Julian's return after several years of being away from the rat race.<br /><br />Not only does Julian survive the heart attack, he quits the law firm, sells all of his possessions (including his red Ferrarai) and travels to India on an \\"expedition\\" to become a monk. This explains the title of the book. When he returns he visits John and meets with him several times to explain his \\"transformation\\" and to explain the lessons that he has learned.<br /><br />When Julian returns, he is virtually unrecognizable to John. He is lean, tanned and calm. In fact the only evidence left of the man that he once was is a scar on his chest from the surgery he had as a result of his heart attack. Over the course of several meetings, Julian explains how he was transformed by a meeting with the \\"Sages of Sivanna\\". These \\"Sages\\" teach Julian many things and show him that life is much more than material wealth and possessions.<br /><br />This is a spiritual fiction book and I have found it very easy to read and to keep interested in (I have read it four times). One of the things that I found unique (for it's time) was that it also includes an \\"Action Summary\\" and \\"Julian's Wisdom In a Nutshell\\" at the end of every chapter that has provided you with one of the \\"7 Timeless Virtues of Enlightened Living\\".  Many books today include a reader's study guide or group discussion outlines, however this was one of the first books I had encountered that did this in a fiction book.<br /><br />Written in 1997, this book is just as relevant today as it was then. With all the hype about \\"The Secret\\" and the fiction book \\"The Shack\\", Mr. Sharma brought all of the lessons that they have been teaching into his book at least ten years before they became popular. I would recommend that you read this book, particularly if you have read similar books and you will see that learning life lessons can be enjoyable when combined with an interesting story. I also recommend \\"Life Lessons From The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari\\" and I deem it essential to own and KEEP \\"Who Will Cry When You Die\\", both by Robin Sharma. His latest book \\"The Leader Who Had No title\\" has a good message, however I was put off by the poor editing.<br /><br />Please contact me if you have any questions or comments - I would love to hear from you.<br /><br />Laughter and love,<br /><br />Rick Fessto read and to keep interested in (I have read it four times).

B003EYVXTG|4.0|Winter's Bone is like Frozen River, another recent Oscar nominated film, in that it depicts the lives of poor, rural people; but easier to bear because of the distraction of solving the mystery of the father's whereabouts.     Debra Granik filmed in Missouri using local, non-professional actors in supporting roles. As someone who is from a rural area I appreciate seeing a story in this setting, void of caricature, with the details intact. In some ways Winter's Bone reminds me of Byambasuren Davaa's narrative documentaries about Mongolian nomads (e.g. Cave of the Yellow Dog, The Story of the Weeping Camel), where local people play themselves in fictional stories. Similarly, Granik's vision and attention to detail, and use of local talent, lets us see a place many of us don't know firsthand.    A highlight for me is Granik's depiction of the children, especially Ashlee, the 6yo girl. We get to know her almost exclusively by observing her playing and caring for animals, which captures the essence of a young child's way of being in the world in a way few films do.     This movie is partly about the toll of lack of economic opportunity and crystal meth in rural America, which is contextualized by the inclusion of bits of mountain culture (the people playing bluegrass at the party, the scene with Jessop's wood carving, and Teardrop playing the banjo) that show that these characters had something better before their lives slipped away from them.     Because of its depiction of people with an uncertain future in a place where it feels like there was once something better, this film reminds me in some ways of The Last Picture Show.
B000TDGGVU|4.0|Having many options does not always lead to making the best and most effective choices. In a world now swamped with possibilities are they really making our lives better? This book provides great insight into how more choice may effectively be causing paralysis and more importantly how to deal with it.<br /><br />What I really liked about the book was its delving to the human psyche to understand how we are affected by choice. The many examples of making choice in the sight of overwhelming options demonstrate how too many options can in many way inhibit us from making beneficial rational choices.<br /><br />The book is easy to read but I found it took a little while to get me really hooked. It is book that certainly holds you interest and makes you sit up and say 'now that's interesting'. At the end of the day it is book that will make you think and question how you are presented with options. I think, importantly, it will make you more aware of how you go about making choice in the face of overwhelming options and importantly arm you with the knowledge to make intelligent rather than default choices.<br /><br />For those that want to understand the process of human decision making and how external factors affect this then this book is a recommended read. Even if you are simply interested in how people tick and why they do the things they do then, likewise, I think this book will peak your interest.

Within the first few chapters, the things that philip did to her, as a11 year old was so disturbing that i couldn't believe for one moment was happening.  Yet, it happened.  And this is just one account of so many out  there that remains untold.  I am so grateful for Jayc to reveal as much as she did on her life and how she made it through those 18 years it is an amazing story of survival and love.

No more carrying a tripod because this has two straps with locks on them for you to strap your tripod to for easy, on the go transport.     I love this bag!

There is an underlying theme of what is causing the troubles to return, knowing that the main character is somehow going to be a big part of it but not why.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I already have multiple copies of the Star Wars movies from VHS to LASERDISC to DVD.  I for one am not going to buy this Bluray boxset.  When I do purchase HD versions of the saga, it will have ALL the versions of each movie included.<br />  Close Encounters and Blade Runner Bluray boxsets, are perfect examples of what I'm hoping that Old George will finally give us in the end.  After all,  I'm sure we (the fans) have PAID the franchise enough in the past, to deserve only the BE$T!

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I got it cuz it was free but after trying this app I was amazed. $1.49 is cheaper than buying a cable to tranfer files. whats better, being able to tranfer anywhere without carring a cable is just priceless.
B001AEF6IQ|4.0|Better than most \\"let's stop them from taking over\\" series.  It keeps you guessing how Jack is, where is really came from, and what is roll is in all this.  I stayed up almost all night after receiving this one watching the first 3 discs.
B000BKJ78U|5.0|I had the original VHS set and liked the improvements Lucas made. In this dvd set the sound was great but I was really impressed with the sharp picture quality. I never saw the original movies in the theater and it felt like a theater experiece watching this set on my 32 inch lcd. I use a HDMI connection from my dvd player and I am sure this was a factor. This would be a great set to have in any dvd collection.
B004WPYNY8|3.0|I agree with another reviewer that the songs sound about the same, and soon sound like one long song. This album is better than Paradise Lost, but not as spectacular as V or Odyssey.     Russell Allen has one of the best, if not THE BEST, voices in rock/metal. And the last few albums have had him growling more and more, where he sounds like so many others. I don't mind the growls if there is some other variation that showcases him.     And the lyrics are just plain dumb and sophomoric. Electric Messiah and Bastards of the Machine sound like something a high schooler would think himself clever for writing. Or like Portnoy/Petrucci tried to write/force on Systematic Chaos (\\"hey let's write a song about a Mummy in the Dark Eternal Night, or a Dark Master\\"). Granted, V has some dumb lyrics also, but they were still elaborate and grandiose, memorable, and with enough variety to show Russell's range. Maybe it is the record company that is forcing the direction, I don't know.     Not that this album is bad... It is actually good, and some parts were surprising. But after waiting this long I was expecting more.

0300169787|5.0|Alexander McQueen died February 11, 2010. He was an icon in the fashion industry.<br />This book is not only chronicles his life but, explores the process it took to be where he ended up, his ingenuity, his innovation and his legacy. I read this beautiful book in one day. This is a lovely tribute to a fashion designer and conceptual artist who died too young but whose contributions to the fashion and art world will live on. This book is likely to become a collector's item; it will sell out quickly so GRAB IT!

B0059R5Q08|3.0|First off, I am the biggest fan of Jane Eyre. I have seen all the adaptations, have several copies of the book and would claim it is my favorite novel of all time. That being said, I was severely disappointed with this adaptation of the novel. I felt that the characters were incredibly static and did not develop as they should.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender (him especially), however I felt that their performances fell short of the actual characters they were portraying.    There was little development as the movie progressed. The character of Jane grows from this meek and timid girl into this powerhouse of a woman. However, in this adaptation, she is not afraid to state her opinion and is bold right out of the gate. The audience cannot grow and push for her as a character if she does not develop as the story progresses.  Rochester is the same way.  In the real story, he at first comes off as a gruff and enigmatic person.  He changes though from that dark, brooding character into one who is to be pitied- he starts off strong and domineering and ends up the weaker of Jane and himself. In this version however, he is this character that is both gruff and tortured straight from the get go. He does not develop into being the weaker character.    Things just progressed at an odd pace in this film.  However I will say I did like the creative use of flashbacks to tell the story and the hints of things from the book (i.e. when the tree Jane and Rochester were standing under gets struck by lightning) without actually drawing attention to them.
1451629184|5.0|I just cannot imagine having to go through what Jaycee had to go through. She was/is such a strong, brave, loving woman. I don't know if I could have gone through what she went through and still be alive. I wanted to read but yet I wanted to put the book down but yet I COULDN'T put the book down till I was clear through.  The book/story was/is good, sad, heart breaking, etc.  I pray her and her girls and the rest of her family can put their lives back together after such a hellish nightmare and find some kind of peace.  God Bless and be with them all.
1451629184|3.0|This book wasnt as intrusive as i thought it was going to be. Horrible story for that poor woman. Its sad that somebody had to go through that and nobody noticed.
0525951652|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet, but I've learned a lot more about WWI and how the European countries viewed it.  As always, Ken Follett brings history to life.  Can't tell yet if I love it more than Pillars of the Earth!
B00005JKDR|4.0|When you watch this movie, you'll laugh...and be drawn in by the wonderful animation. Colorful, wonderfully dimensional, and crisp animations will, for the durance of this movie, trick you into believing--or wanting to believe--it's all real. And the story itself is just plain funny without being corny. The characters are original and charming; the plot is creative (a monster factory collects kids' screams, which are turned into energy. One day, a human girl accidentally gets into the monster world due to the villain's carelessness, and a hard worker and his assistant must get her back to the human world). Splendid. The movie does tend to wander until the conclusion, and sometimes the movie is a little too sentimental, but it does not affect this brilliant film very much, if at all.

B003Y5H5A6|4.0|This is the best comic book movie to be released this summer. That is what it is, a comic book movie. It does not surpass that level but nobody ever said it had to. While not a Spider-man 2 or Dark Knight it fits in well as a first entry in an inevitable series. Perhaps not the fun, turn the formula on its head, film that Iron Man was, it is still an excellent comic book film that manages to have developed characters and a story actually propelled by plot rather than CG sequences (I'm looking at you Transformers 2 and 3). Still, even with all its positive attributes the film might've been largely a one time viewing for me, that is, if it hadn't been for Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter.     My personal, and largest, issue with comic book movies has been their seeming inability to cast memorable and talented women in the leading lady spot. While the leading lady role has frequently been nothing more than a damsel in distress (other than perhaps in team up movies such as X-men), something unfortunately true even of Nolan's gritty Dark Knight films, here we find that is not the case. Peggy Carter is a female character who stands out amongst the many comic book movie female characters. She is strong willed, independent, can handle herself, never asks for help, doesn't take any crap and does it all in a period where women were undeniably treated as less than men. She does all these things yet she can still walk into a bar in the middle of the film wearing a red dress that leaves everyone at a loss for words.     Even better than Peggy Carter's character, and the reason I named the actress rather than the character in my review title, was the casting of Hayley Atwell in the role. The character could have become something much different without a capable actress to play the balance of tough yet feminine. Worse it could have been filled by some less capable big name actress for box office draw. For years in comic book movies I have either dreaded or at best barely stomached the casting of female leading roles.     Kirsten Dunst had her moments in the Spidey films but then would come the time when she had to be kidnapped and scream and holler for help, she also always needed a man in her life, if not Peter then another stand in to take his place. Batman Begins casting of Katie Holmes always seemed strange to me, why in a film full of lower status but credible actors would Nolan cast a more household name with much less credibility? Whatever the reason, she played the part but it is not the role anyone remembers from that film. The same goes for the sequel, in which I had high hopes Maggie Gyllenhaal would make welcome changes to the previously pitchy character, unfortunately I dare say that Rachel Dawes only became more helpless and became the one negative to be found in The Dark Knight.     More recently I was disappointed to find Gwenyth and Natalie both playing supposed strong women but one (Pepper Potts) who is subordinate to a man who treats her badly and still needs to be saved in the end and the other (Jane Foster) fairly shallow and school girlish overall.     While Jane only likes Thor at first because of his muscles, Peggy meets Steve Rogers/The Cap when he is a ninety pound weakling. We see her first tinge of interest in him when he is still this small, all based on his philosophies on fighting and dating. It is this established connection before he becomes a perfect male specimen that cements the story and keeps us truly engaged. Peggy and Steve truly bring out the best in eachother and actually share a common bond of struggling to break free from their respective stereotypes that allows the audience to believe in their relationship, one that is actually formed out of friendship first. The film is great and a wonderful starting point for a series, the ending is unique if only a plot device required for the Avengers tie in and I truly can't wait to see where they take Captain America in his sequel. He has by the end of the film, especially thanks to Peggy Carter, become quite a different hero with quite a different chip on his shoulders than any we have yet to see.     So I have wondered why comic book movies don't cast relatively unknown actresses to play these parts and allow them to really create a character. Finally Captain America has done just that with the lovely Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter and I hope we see much more of it in future comic book films. The saddest part of Captain America and perhaps the thing that compells me to want to see it again Repeated times is that based on the ending it is very unlikely we will see the fantastic Peggy Carter/Hayley Atwell in all her glory in any of the sequels. They have some big shoes to fill when they inevitably try to create a Sharon Carter character, let's hope they take cues from however it was that they came to choose Hayley.

142314189X|5.0|I am so incredibly surprised that Percy Jackson doesn't stand right next to Harry Potter; well it does in my mind. The characters are engaging, the story is thrilling and exciting, and it is just a hilarious read. Love the story and everything about the series.
0553801473|3.0|I was only recently introduced to George R.R. Martin by a friend who invited me to sit down and watch the HBO television adaptation of Game of Thrones. After watching that first episode I observed two things. One: there is a lot of sex in this show. Two: the story was good enough to stand on its own without all the graphic sex.  Not that I'm complaining of course.  But when you've got a story that good... on television no less... you really start thinking, I should read the books.<br /><br />If you haven't read the first four novels of the Saga of A Song of Ice And Fire, stop right now and go do that.  But if you have read the first four novels, get ready for some disappointment. Not in the writing... but in the farce that is Westeros and Mereeen.<br /><br />A Dance With Dragons takes us right back to follow some of our favorite characters, and as Martin admits himself, the timeline of ADWD actually runs concurrently with A Feast For Crows.  As with any soap opera mixed with bloody violence, bad things keep happening to the good guys.  In fact, so MANY bad things happen that I'm beginning to suspect Martin of channeling some inner Charles Dickens.  Every fricken time you turn around and think \\"finally! The good guys are going to start winning!\\" you turn around and some other awful thing happens to them.  There are plots within plots, aspects of the story that don't seem to real contribute to the overall plot arc, and then... Martin again kills off one of my favorite \\"good\\" characters.<br /><br />That just pisses me off.<br /><br />That said, A Dance With Dragons is still a good book, but it isn't the best in the series.  It moves the plot forward, but Arya's list of a-holes who need killing hasn't gotten much shorter and frankly, there are some other people who need to be added to it.  I'm still waiting for the Frey's to get their comeuppance, as well as for Ramsay the Bastard to have some one gut him, skin him, and feed his worthless, cruel, and villainous carcassto his own dogs.  Yes. I have some anger management issues.<br /><br />Now, I won't say who got killed, but I will say this: House Stark better come back with a fricken vengeance when this is all over.
