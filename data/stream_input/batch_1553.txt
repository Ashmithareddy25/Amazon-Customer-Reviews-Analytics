1416550550|5.0|It was a pleasure to read. Today's authors write manuals with so much technical description and almost no story.  Every page of this book kept you engrossed. I would put it down because I did not want it to end, wanted it to last.  Reminds me of  the author Elizabeth Adler when she first starting writing books. While waiting for Morton's next book, try picking up one of Elizabeth Adler's first books.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I downloaded the first chapter as a free preview of Fifty Shades to see whether or not it lived up to the hype. I couldn't make it past the first paragraph! The whole story is the creation of someone with a skewed concept of intimacy and no sense of realism.<br /><br />FSoG is what it is--Twilight fan-fiction retooled to avoid copyright infringement and published without the benefit of any refinement, editing, or development. Stories need some believable elements or the reader can't relate or connect with it, and that's how I felt one paragraph into it. There wasn't anything that grabbed my attention and made me feel as though the book would be worth the time to read. Nothing about this novel seems worthy of viral frenzy surrounding it.<br /><br />Bottom line: use the \\"Try a Sample\\" feature before you commit $10 to FSoG. I'm glad I did!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I liked Jack, but was not crazy about any other characters.  The book was hard to put down.  I would definitely read more Jack Reacher novels, but hope I can find a way to give a darn about the other characters.  Another thing that bothered me was that the Department of Treasury does not know where their agents are while in the field and does not investigate their murders.  I did not have a problem with the violence in the book.

0307719774|5.0|I love this idea.  I do some professional writing, but nothing in a journal format since I was a teenager.  A friend of mine recommended \\"Wreck this Journal\\" as something that opened up her inner journaler.  I visited Amazon to learn more about that book and I know that I could never destroy a journal.  This product was a recommended product.  I've really never thought about having a five year journal, but it sounds awesome.<br /><br />I've been doing it for about 2 weeks and the questions are kind of general (what is your favorite gadget, who is your best companion), and I've made a few \\"off topic\\" observations too (for example, when the Aurora shooting happened, I ignored the prompt and wrote about that).  I love the flexibility to write what I want for major events in my life, but if I don't have anything to say, I have a prompt.  That's been a problem with my adult journaling. Every time I've tried, I've found myself having not a lot to say every day.  Teenage me always had something to say!  These prompts will be a fun record of \\"me\\" five years down the line.  It should be fun to see how they change and also keep track of my thoughts on major events.<br /><br />Some people have mentioned the size as a con.  I like the size of the journal.  I've been keeping it by my bed and writing in it before I go to sleep.  It doesn't take up much space and the cover is not very assuming so nobody would really think to pick it up and read through it.  I think the space is sufficient. Some days I've wanted to write more than the few lines on each page, but it forces me to be succinct.  More than my wordy days, I have days when writing a whole page, even to the prompt, would be daunting.  So, I'm glad there's not more than a few lines.<br /><br />We'll see how it holds up over the years.  The binding doesn't seem to be too impressive for a book that will be opened everyday, but I hope to be proven wrong!
B001EN71DQ|4.0|The discs came in excellent condition: a few ligt scratches, but the movie didn't skip at all. The DVDs did not come in a boxed set as pictured, but in separate DVD cases, one of which was mildly torn. Each episode also came with a bonus disc, of which I have yet to watch any. Overall, a great buy.

B002KKCVUA|5.0|I bought these sandals before my recent beach trip, and wore them for lots of walking straight from the box without any break-in time. I am woman, size 12 shoe normally, and these men's sandals were not too wide for my feet. And, the back strap is adjustable for my narrow heels - no slipping or rubbing when I walk. They dry quickly when you get them wet, provide a reasonable traction on slippery surfaces, and are very comfortable. I highly recommend these sandals for lots of walking and water activities like boating, beach, backyard water play, and the pool. My feet now love summer!

B003MQNENY|1.0|This is not the only abridged edition of a literary work Amazon is offering without any warning at all that it's abridged.  If Kindle books are to be acceptable to serious readers, full disclosure is a must.<br /><br />Moreover, Amazon is accepting for distribution \\"Kindle\\" versions of books that are so shabbily scanned that the errors interrupt the reading flow.  In most cases one can see how machine scanning could cause the error; what's not acceptable is that no editor has gone through the product with a fine-tooth comb before putting it out there.<br /><br />Don't buy them when warned, return them when surprised, and call them out by name - identifying publisher if possible.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|OVERVIEW/ANALYSIS: Blood Song is another of those books that I discovered a few months earlier, thanks to Amazon's cool algorithm for suggesting titles I might like based on my previous \\"Buying and Search\\" history. Previously I had stumbled upon Zero Sight by B Justin Shier the same way and the way that book turned out to be, I have learnt to keep an eye out for such Amazon recommendations.<br /><br />Blood Song begins with a first person narrative featuring Lord Verniers Alishe Someren, a chronicler that has been chosen to write about the main character Vaelin Al-Sorna and about the journey that they both will undertake.  The story then begins Vaelin's past as when as a child he's commanded to join the Sixth Order of the Faith of the Unified Realm. Thus begins Vaelin's journey wherein he will learn to wield weapons and become a famed warrior of the unified realm that will also earn him many names all across various nations and regions. Friends and foes alike will be drawn to him in differing amounts. But when all is said and done, Vaelin's journey has only begun as the reader will learn more about his past as well as that of his realm.<br /><br />One searches for the next best thing in fantasy, often going through many books in search of the book that will enthrall you completely. I almost missed on this beauty by buying it but then never getting around to reading it. I owe thanks to Michael Sullivan for reminding me about this book and what a book it is. Beginning from the events in the past to the current story going on currently, this setup has been explored in various fantasy, historical and other genre novels.<br /><br />The most recent famous example being The Name Of The Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. In fact a similarity between those two books can be seen in regards to the protagonist's story and their growth via a university/military school setting. What differentiates these two books is a terrific conclusion to the book as well as themes about war and its follies. Also this was my observation but I found some shades of David Gemmell in Anthony Ryan's storytelling style and prose. It is heartening to see a Brit take up the mantle of heroic, epic fantasy from one of fantasy's most distinguished writers as well as a fellow British writer.<br /><br /> This book is more akin to a traditional epic fantasy wherein it's set in a pseudo-European setting and with a world history that is unveiled slowly and tantalizingly. At the same time, there is a core mystery at the heart of this plotline, why was Vaelin sent to the sixth order? What really happened with his parents? Who is the One Who Waits? These questions and much more abound this volume and will tempt readers into coming back for the later parts of this trilogy. The book focuses in the past as well as the present and the author has tantalizingly kept both time periods shrouded in mystery. This thread is what powers the book throughout and makes the story such a strong one.<br /><br />Characterization is also a strong point in this opening volume, even though we get a singular narrative voice for the majority of the book. The author has created a fascinating side character cast particularly King Janus, Princess Lyrna just to name a few, these characters make the story even more fascinating and with the increase in POV character cast in \\"Tower Lord\\" (book II). I can't wait to see which other characters get their own narrative voices. The book ends on a strong note and with a twist that is hard to anticipate, giving the readers a complete story if they want to read just this book however I'm sure once the readers finish this book they will want to read \\"Tower Lord\\" the next in the Raven's Shadow trilogy.<br /><br />Anthony Ryan's Blood Song is a tremendous debut; it has a fast paced, action packed and character driven story. Qualities to admire in any genre story and most of all in an epic fantasy one. Give this book a read, if you have ever felt that Indie books have no quality to them, give this book a read if you are tired of the same morass of stories in the epic fantasy genre, give this book a read if you want a well written story by a newbie author and lastly give this book a read if you want to read a story that's closest to those written by David Gemmell.ity to them, give this book a read if you are tired of the same morass of stories in the epic fantasy genre, give this book a read if you want a well written story by a newbie author and lastly give this book a read if you want to read a story that's closest to those written by David Gemmell.

0307950689|3.0|I read all the other books in the series, thinking that the last book would be just as thrilling. However, my assumption turned out to be incorrect. It was lacking in both plot tension, and character development. When it comes to Robert Langdon, we readers expect him to exhibit the same clever and endearing qualities that he always gave without fail. Now, he has been reduced to being a bumbling fool who refuses to acknowledge anything the other characters say. He repeats the same arguments almost word for word in every chapter. The villain, however, may be given a little too much \\"screen time\\". We as readers love a complex antagonist with depth as well as mystique; but, the author seems to have been trying a bit too hard. Basically half the novel is reading about Mal'ak's past. The problem with that is that after we learned everything about him, what he did still didn't make since. There are many other alternatives to his actions, and since he is supposedly such a genius, he should have been able to think of them! Lastly, I have to address the science and logic of the book. Part of the appeal of the series has always been that the series of events is possible, and that all of the logic is sound to the readers. This time, it is featuring Noetics. This field is a vague science that most people are skeptical about. It's painful to see the protagonists drawn in by such a shady area in the academic field. In reality, most people would agree that there are many mistakes and logical jumps in the current assertions of Noetics. The biggest problem with the book's use of it is that most of the so called jumps in Noetics have already, allegedly, occurred. There are scientists saying the exact same, apparently groundbreaking, things. Sadly, these scientists are almost universally considered quacks speaking to the gullible. If you believe in Noetics, I assume it will be a much more enjoyable journey than I had. For the people who want to see what becomes of Langdon, read at your own risk. Afterwards, I wouldn't be very surprised to hear you say it was a waste of time.own risk. Afterwards, I wouldn't be very surprised to hear you say it was a waste of time.

As always Alan Felix played by Woody is his usual insecure self regarding women . His struggles at dating after becoming recently divorced are painfully  hilarious . I try to watch this film at least once a year . Woody expresses comedically what most evey man feels at one time or another<br />with regard to women . It will make you laugh very hard at Woody and your self in the process . Believe  me you will get your moneys worth from this film . If you like Woody that is . Probably the  most hilarious of  his works I have ever seen

030745455X|5.0|The book is in a brand new condition, and the delivery is in a fast fashion.  The story is engrossing as ever, it's certainly a page-turner.  I am not a very fast reader, and I used my break time at work everyday to read it, plus a little bit time before going to sleep, and I finished within a week.  I personally think that the book is way better than the movie as the movie skipped a lot of important details.  If I watch the movie before reading the book, everything might be a bit obscure to me.  But with all the details from the book, every single piece of material had been put together perfectly.  So my advice is to read the book first.  This book is highly recommended, and I think it's a bit better than \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" even though it's quite good too.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book. If a book doesn't grab me quickly I  stop reading and never pick it back up. This one did, Chapter one-I was hooked! I couldn't get enough!
0525478817|4.0|I waited a little bit and let the ending sink in before I started this review. I have been terrified to read this book because I was so afraid it wouldn't live up to the hype. Luckily, it did. Here's why: it's a young adult book. I see exactly why I see pictures of it and quotes all over blogs, because Green wrote exactly for the tumblr generation (not isolated to tumblr of course). Their speech patterns, their phrases, their ways of thinking. It was uncanny.<br /><br />I liked it. I loved Hazel, she's snarky and cynical and doesn't let anyone talk down to her because she's sick. I also liked Augustas, because he's very smart and isn't afraid to be exactly who he wants to be. Neither of them let being sick define them, but they do have moments of weakness. Green showed every phase of being sick, from being able to cope one day to screaming and cursing the next, to not being able to feel anything. It was beautifully done without making a mockery of itself. Plus, I always appreciate witty sarcasm.<br /><br />But- and I write this knowing it is contrary to almost every review I've seen on the book, don't hurt me- it got a little preachy. I mean there was a little nugget of wisdom on almost every page, definitely in every chapter. At moments I felt like I was being beat over the head with insight. It wasn't ever forced, there was just so much of it. I felt like I could never really appreciate each quote because there was another one so soon afterwards. My brain didn't have time to take it all in.<br /><br />However, I did love it. It was quietly tragic in the way that Never Let Me Go was, you know one of them is going to die. It's inevitable. You're practically told by the fictional book An Imperial Affliction that the book will end without a real ending. Even so, you're still hoping it will change. You're hoping you're wrong and you'll be surprised and they'll live happily ever after. Of course that doesn't happen, but it doesn't stop you wanting it. Green creates a very real first love, all the sudden you're in love and wondering how you got there. It was beautiful.<br /><br />I am overly critical because I over-analyze, and even though I tried to turn off my brain I can't. So I'll say I'm not a crazy fangirl about this book, I didn't cry (surprising), it didn't make me feel \\"all the feelings\\". But I liked it very much. I just don't know how much longer I can read young adult non-fantasy/sci-fi fiction without wanting more from it. What I would very much like is for John Green to write an adult book, because I think THAT would make me cry for days.
B005723JSQ|4.0|Kinsella's latest is exactly what you'd expect if you're familiar with her work - a quirky, disheveled female lead, an ending that you can guess from page 1 and tons of fun along the way. This was a quick and entertaining read. Yes, it was Kinsella by numbers - look at the cover! Her name totally overshadows the title - but it's what her followers (including myself) love. A lot of this story is told via text message, which was a fun twist. I loved the dialogue going back and forth, as Kinsella always phrases things so cleverly. There were some serious laugh-out-loud moments and I didn't want to put it down.

1401216676|5.0|\\"That's what a dose of reality does for you ... Never touch the stuff myself, you understand. Find it gets in the way of the hallucinations.\\" --The Joker.<br /><br />1988 wasn't the start of it, but that year definitely had a hand in it. The \\"it\\" was the development of comics beyond the super-hero funny books. These new books were mature, graphic, and in the end, important--at least as far as the growth of comics as a real form of literature. And at the forefront of this movement were a few of the most respected and valued writers comics--and truly the world--will ever know. I'm talking about Frank Miller and Alan Moore.<br /><br />I couldn't tell you--without stopping to go through some back issues--what Frank Miller was doing in 1988, but among Alan Moore's achievements was the instant classic Batman: The Killing Joke, a simple, 46-page glossy paper book, illustrated by the wonderful Brian Bolland. Whether he knew it at the time or not (and I'm inclined to believe he did), this little one-shot story about yet another of the Joker's breaks from Arkham Asylum, Gotham City's home \\"for the criminally insane\\" (and with the assistance of Frank Miller's own Batman: Year One, 1986-87, and The Dark Knight Returns, 1987) was about to take Batman (and comics in general) onto a whole new level of craft. From this point on, there was no more denying it: as much as I hate the cliche, comics weren't for kids anymore. Some of them, The Killing Joke for example, might not be for kids at all.<br /><br />What would take to send you over the edge? That's the main point of this story.<br /><br />The plot is simple enough. The Joker has once again escaped Arkham Asylum. While Batman is trying to track him down, the Joker has kidnapped Commissioner Gordon, and shot his daughter Barbara (who's days of being Batgirl are apparently now over; the bullet leaves her paralyzed from the waist down), then stripped her, and taken some pictures. Back at the Joker's \\"hide-out\\", a rundown carnival,he strips Gordon and forces him onto the Ghost Train where he tries to convince the commissioner that the easiest way to deal with the pressures of life is to just loose your mind.<br /><br />\\"So when you find yourself locked onto an unpleasant train of thought, heading for the places in your past where the screaming is unbearable, remember there's always madness. Madness is the emergency exit. You can just step outside, and close the door on all those dreadful things that happened. You can lock them away ... forever.\\"<br /><br />The ride leaves the commissioner a shaking mess--probably due to the blown up pictures of his naked, bleeding daughter the Joker has projected onto the walls of the Ghost Train ride. Very soon Batman arrives. There's a showdown, a chase through the house of mirrors, and the book's final confrontation where the Joker tries to convince Batman that they're both more similar than they thought, all of their problems reducible to one very bad day on both of their ends, a bad day buried somewhere in their past that led them to the lives they chose to lead, Batman's leading him to don a rubber suit, the Joker's leading to madness. Batman counters with an offer.<br /><br />\\"It doesn't have to end like that. I don't know what it was that bent your life out of shape, but who knows? Maybe I've been there too. Maybe I can help.\\"<br /><br />In the end, the Joker is just trying to justify his own insanity by proving that ANYONE can be driven crazy.<br /><br />This is a wonderful story and anyone who's ever read Alan Moore's work (especially his Miracleman and Watchmen stories, or his graphic novel From Hell which spawned the movie of the same name just a couple years ago) knows it goes deeper than just the plot I've laid out here. Alan Moore is a genius at getting under the surface of the story. In the end, we're left wondering if maybe the Joker's not right, if maybe the choices we make in our lives during the course ONE BAD DAY can so drastically altereverything that follows.<br /><br />When he thinks he's ruined Commissioner Gordon, he tells Batman, \\"I've demonstrated there's no difference between me and everyone else! All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day ... You had a bad day, and it drove you as crazy as everybody else ... only you won't admit it. You have to keep pretending that life makes sense, that there's some point to all this struggling. God, you make me want to puke.\\" And it's here we realize he's right about one thing. Anyone familiar with Batman's origin knows that's exactly what happened, a bad day (anyone who doesn't know the story by now, why don't you?)<br /><br />And what was the Joker's bad day? That's the subplot, the Joker's real origin (maybe it's the real one, we don't know. He tells Batman sometimes he remembers it one way, sometimes another) which is just as tragic as Batman's. He was a struggling comedian living in Gotham's slum with a pregnant wife. He gets the chance to pull one big robbery and set himself up in a new place in the good part of town. The day it's set to take place, his wife is killed in a \\"million to one accident\\". Faced with this, he no longer needs the money and wants to back out, but the thugs who brought him into the deal won't let him. The robbery goes bad and the Joker jumps into a vat of chemicals. When he comes out the other end, his skin is bleached white. His hair is green. His face is paralyzed into the evil grin we all know. And his mind is forever lost. One very bad day. And one great story.<br /><br />Helping Moore along are artist Brian Bolland and colorist John Higgins. Brian Bolland is terrific. The first two pages alone, 18 speechless panels, convey more with facial expressions (not to mention the \\"You don't have to be crazy to work here--but it helps!\\" sign on the receptionist's desk. Nice touch!) than some artist do in 5 pages of action. The shadows are deep. The rain makes you want to shield your eyes. The ONE panel showing the commissioner's bondage is terrifying. There's also the shock on Barbara's face when she opens the door and finds the Joker standing outside, another perfect illustration. But Bolland does his best work later, after Gordon has come out of the Ghost Train. Over a simple 8 panel spread, the Batmobile arrives, headlights glaring. Batman emerges while the Joker's gang flees. The Joker never moves. In the background, Commission Gordon is naked and sitting in a cage in the middle of the fairgrounds. And then the Joker smiles, and this one panel is the most evil I've ever seen him. Alan Moore and Brian Bolland both took full advantage of the chance to go beyond what normal comic books allowed in those days, both in story and art. The dialogue is fierce. The pictures are horrible. Both in a good way.<br /><br />This is definitely a book even the most anti-comics reader can enjoy, and if you can get a copy, you're doing yourself an injustice in NOT doing so. That goes for ANY of Alan Moore's work.
030758836X|5.0|I'm in love with Gillian Flynn.  No, actually I am in love with the way she writes and the way that she thinks and the way that she tells a story.  Don't just read Gone Girl, her break through this will make her as hot as James Patterson book, but go back and start with Sharp Objects and Dark Places her first two novels and you will see the burgeoning genius of this writer.  If Strindberg wrote novels they'd be just like Gillian Flynn's only not as funny.  While reading it I kept thinking of other playwrights such as Eugene O'Neill (Iceman Cometh and Long Days Journey Into Night) and especially Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (\\"....I swear to Christ if you existed I'd divorce you!\\")  This book is dark; all her books are dark but boy does this \\"darkness\\" shed a lot of light on the human condition and does so with a sense of humor that cracks like a whip across your consciousness.  The last book to catch me this way was Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections and Gone Girl is in that league
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I would have given the movie 5 stars if I did not read the book. The movie was so good that I had to read the book and I am a person who never reads.

I know its not easy to do but if you read the book you would understand. Either way I pre-ordered the movie and can not wait to watch it again.
1594203334|5.0|Of all the books on parenting, marriage, and teaching children this one is tops. I think I highlighted almost every word! The blend of personal prose with heavy research flows seamlessly to challenge every parent/woman to take a look at what children are capable of and what a healthy balance of love and common sense can accomplish. I want to move to France now! ha. I also want to buy a copy for everyone I know. Thank you for writing in a tone that is neither condescending or patronizing, as many parenting/marriage/motherhood books can be. If there is a sequel I am already sold.

B003Y5H5HO|2.0|I love it when they come out with movies based on books.  It gives me a chance to see what someone else had in mind when they read the story on paper.  This was no exception.  I read the book-and enjoyed it immensely.  I was excited to watch the US version of this movie.  It was awful.  I couldn't understand the actors because they were talking SO LOW.  I turned my volume up the whole way and all I heard was mumbling.  The only thing that was plain as day was the sex scenes, which there were plenty.  Yes, the sex was in the book, but it wasn't the main point of the story.  I felt that they focused way too much on the sex, and not at the heart of the story.<br /><br />To top it off, they rushed the ending and CHANGED it.  I read the book and half the time I had no idea what was going on towards the end of the movie.  The ending was terrible.  I heard the international version was better, I'll be watching that one soon.
B0000524CY|5.0|(originally written Sept. 30, 2005)<br /><br />I remember it very clearly, as if were last night. I remember the girl's head spinning completely around. I remember her vomiting into the man's face. I remember her floating into the air and her skin splitting open. I remember eating pizza and throwing up on my pillow. These are not things told to me, I recall them, and when I gave the details to my mother, she looked at me with shock on her face, because while the details of the movie I could have learned anytime, the part about the pizza and getting sick on my pillow was something she'd never told me, it was something I remembered. She was shocked because, at the time, I was just over a year old, 15 months maybe. THE EXORCIST is my earliest memory. Some would say it explains a lot that came over the next 33 years.<br /><br />Voted by ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY as \\"The scariest movie of all time\\", THE EXORCIST, originally released in December 1973, was directed by William Friedkin (THE FRENCH CONNECTION, THE HUNTED), and based on the novel by William Peter Blatty (THE NINTH CONFIGURATION). Inspired by an actual exorcism that took place in 1949, THE EXORCIST tells the story of 12-year-old Regan MacNeil, played by Linda Blair.<br /><br />Regan is in Georgetown with her actress mother, Chris, who's shooting a movie there. Regan likes horses, she likes art and has a mini-studio space set up in the basement, full of drawings and clay sculptures. Regan is cute as can be. Director Friedkin paints a picture of a very normal family, a very normal girl, innocent and cheerful and a joy to be around. But out of the blue things begin to happen. Regan climbs into bed with her mother one night, claiming she couldn't sleep in her own bed because it was shaking. Later, Chris comes home one night to find Regan upstairs screaming for her. When she enters her daughter's room, there's Regan in bed, and the bed is indeed shaking, as if there were an earthquake beneath it. Regan begins to exhibitviolent behavior, cursing and throwing things. Concerned for her daughter, Chris takes Regan to a series of doctors, all trying to pinpoint some neurological disorder to explain her sudden change in behavior. None can.<br /><br />One doctor throws out the possibility of an exorcism. Not because he believes in such things, no one expects this pretty little girl is honestly possessed by the Devil, but if this is some mental issue with Regan, if she undergoes an exorcism, perhaps whatever subconscious belief she holds, whatever it is inside her mind that's causing this behavior, maybe it'll change. Placebos work because the patients who aren't really sick at all believe they work.<br /><br />Chris laughs at the idea, neither she nor Regan are religious, there's nothing spiritually wrong with her daughter. But when Regan tosses her mother across the room and almost causes a dresser to fall on her, then Regan's head turns 180 degrees and speaks to Chris in the voice of her dead friend Burke Dennings, Chris's attitude changes.<br /><br />Lemme backtrack a bit here. Burke Dennings. Burke is the director of the film Chris is shooting. At a party she throws, he's an obnoxious drunk. She comes home one night to find Regan alone in the house. When Chris questions her assistant Sharon, Sharon says she left Regan with Burke. Chris's producer then arrives and tell her Burke's been killed. From what they can tell, it appears he fell from Regan's second-floor bedroom window, down to the street, and then down a set of 74 concrete steps. When they found him, his head was turned 180s.<br /><br />Now, while Chris is dealing with what's happening to her daughter, there's also Lt. Kinderman to worry about, investigating Burke's death, saying without saying that he believes Regan may have had something to do with it.<br /><br />When Chris finally admits to herself that the thing in Regan's bedroom is not her daughter, she seeks the help of the priest/psychologist who works on the nearbycampus. Damien Kerris (Jason Miller in his first screen role) is a struggling Catholic. With the recent death of his mother, Father Kerris has been questioning his own faith, his own purpose. When he meets Chris MacNeil, he doesn't believe for a second that what's inside Regan is really a demon, but as a psychologist he has a list of other possible causes. After all, Regan doesn't claim she's a demon, but the Devil himself. When Father Kerris tells her the tap water he has is holy water, she reacts violently to being sprinkled with it. But when he records her voice and discovers the language she's speaking is English in reverse, and that there are several voices on the tape at once, he convinces the Church to authorize the exorcism. Kerris has never performed one, so they call in Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) who has faced this evil before--faced this demon Pazuzu before as a matter of fact. In the end, Regan's transformation into this evil creature, by way of Dick Smith's incredibly revolting makeup job, is complete and we stop believing this girl is acting, we stop seeing 12 year old Linda Blair, and instead look into the eyes of a true demon.<br /><br />THE EXORCIST is, hands down, my favorite movie of all time. At 32 years old, the movie doesn't show its age and is just as relevant and horrifying today as it was upon its release. Part of its success is due to Blair's portrayal of such a simple little girl. Part of its success is due to Blair's portrayal of the demon. Even at 12 years old, Linda Blair made this movie what it is (earning herself an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress in the process). Part of the story's success is due to author Blatty's way of avoiding a drawn out explanation. We don't know why this happens to Regan, there's no reason we can see. It just happens. And, Christ, if it can happen to her, why couldn't it happen to me? I remember thinking that very clearly when I was young. Any time I would see this movie again, that's the thought I'd carry around for weeks afterward, \\"Why couldn't it happen to me?\\" Now, as a father myself, why couldn't it happen to one of my children? And if it did, what would I do? This is the story's brilliance.<br /><br />If you go too in-depth into why the evil happens, it's throwing open that door and seeing the face of the evil in real life isn't quite as bad as the face of the evil you'd imagined. It's the reason so many horror movies today fail, nothing is left out, nothing is left up to the viewer's interpretation. With THE EXORCIST, there is no explanation, there's no phony ritual Regan performed as a joke one night with her girlfriends, unleashing an ancient evil. She's just, one day, possessed. And it's terrifying. It's the only movie that I, even now at 33, cannot watch alone at night.<br /><br />The DVD release is a little disappointing. The commentary Friedkin provides is the worst commentary I've ever heard, offering nothing more than a scene by scene narration of the movie. Good stuff if you're blind and want to experience the movie, but for anyone seeking background details on the making of the movie, you're SOL, man. There's not an anecdote, not a quip, not a rumor, nothing.<br /><br />Other features include trailers for the movie's 2000 re-release and a few behind-the-scenes bits, but even those aren't filmed. You get stills of Friedkin and Blatty with text to the side. I hate that crap. Luckily I need nothing more from THE EXORCIST than the movie itself, because they really went out of their way to make sure there was nothing else worthwhile on this DVD.<br /><br />THE EXORCIST has spawned countless imitators, spoofs (included REPOSSESSED, starring Linda Blair), and sequels. Nothing so far has even come close to matching the original. THE EXORCIST is and always will be THE horror movie to beat. I'm still holding out hope someday someone might actually make a better horror movie, but it's a very slim hope.

Given that I do similar training and coaching, I am fascinated that he has discovered and written up so much of what I myself have encountered over the years. There is a lot to learn and much can be gained from these books.
B004Y12S9W|1.0|Unless I'm missing something, this adapter is crap.  Not because of them, but because of Apple.  I can't believe no one else has commented on this, which makes me question the integrity of the comments overall.  Technically this adapter works great.  On the 2% of unprotected video that I own, it played on the TV beautifully.  Try to watch a properly purchased movie though, and you're out of luck.  Most of the video that I have legitimately purchased on my iPod won't play on the TV through this adapter... it says, \\"Can't play protected video on this device.\\"  I guess they're afraid you're going to set up a movie theatre for stale videos in your home.  I've bought an iMac ($2500), two iPad 2s ($1200) and multiple iPods, etc. in the last 1.5 years for year my family, and have discovered that Apple's security isn't solid - it's paranoid.  I won't buy another Apple product period from this point forward.  If I want to watch a movie that I have purchased and have it on my iPod on my TV, I should be able to.  Screw Apple... Jobs is dead and it wouldn't matter if he was alive.

0439023491|4.0|I loved the first book loved the third but the second I liked. For me it just seemed to be dragging on and just kept building itself up, but that is what is to expected for the second book because it is meant to build up the story for the third. So if you feel that this book let you down just read the third and it will be worth it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This review pertains to a review copy provided by the Publisher via NetGalley.com in exchange for my fair and honest review.<br /><br />I predict a bestseller-and long lines of customers to buy this book. It's not even my usual type of subgenre, yet I am engrossed. I snarled every time real life tried to interrupt me! All I can say is \\"Wow!\\" over and over. The characters, the careful and clear delineation of the layers of emotions, the plot lines, the red herring love interests, the psychological and familial backdrops-just amazing. This is my first book by author Jamie McGuire, but I am definitely a fan now.<br /><br />Best friends Abby and America are new freshmen at Eastern University, and America's boyfriend is Shepley, who rooms in an apartment with his cousin Travis \\"Mad Dog.\\" Travis has two notable elements to his reputation: he is a fighter-illegally-for money; and he is also known as \\"One Night Stand,\\" never with a girlfriend, always with females clinging and wanting attention. The term \\"commitment-phobic\\" wouldn't even scratch the surface of Travis' attitudes. Abby won't have any of it, but begins to hang around because America and Shep are so tight. Next thing she knows, Travis' acting out with other girls becomes even more atrocious, and her interest in a little male attention from a frat brother sets a wedge into her friendship with Travis. When she accompanies Travis to a fight and bets him that the other guy will get in a punch, the bet becomes: Travis' abstinence for a month, vs. Abby's staying in the apartment with Travis, Shep, and America for a month. Either way, that's a recipe for disaster, or a volcanic emotional explosion. Readers will hang on every sentence watching the consequences speedily unfold.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The book was slow in the beginning and I had a hard time understanding what really happened with Blomkvist, but then I did a little research (which is something people could have done instead of wasting time complaining on how dull, and terrible the book is) and I was able to understand what was going on.<br /><br />But the more pages I read, the better it got. It pretty much compelled me and I was completely hooked throughout. Overall, I give Stieg Larsson credit for this book because this was based off of true events. There are times men really do hate women for many reasons(expertise, professionalism, knowledge, appearance, etc). I enjoyed the entire series and would recommend it to other people.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I must say, that I considered Snakes and Arrows to be a great album. Notwithstanding any other reviews on the site about that album, I am quickly hearing and conceptualizing this album as better.  As old as Rush gets, the more seasoned their work, and more in depth the analysis must be.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine this album as a debut, but every album must be considered as such.  If these were 19 year old kids playing this music, would people still flock to it?  Is it just reputation and existing achievements that make their albums so acclaimed, or is there a build up of emotional attachment that makes it so?  I feel it is both.  They haven't let down for a long time over a long travel of personal ups, downs, and consistency.<br /><br />The lyrics are top notch.  The chords are in time and hard rocking with what can only be (every time) Neal's greatest.  All three musicians, and the mix, are relevant and up to date.  There is no doubt that this band listens to current music, reads current literature, knows current trends and makes it so in music.  These are our elders preaching to us the wisdom of the ages.  Deny such wisdom, and you may be living on your own out in the woods...<br /><br />Has it been different in any other album they have produced?<br /><br />Dec. 21 2012, find a guitar, and start tuning, metaphorically speaking, lol...

B0013V33DG|4.0|This production has been generally well liked but there may be some aspects about the production that may worry some potential purchasers.<br /><br />Perhaps the most controversial feature was the decision to cast Dawn French in the non-singing role of the Duchess of Crakentorp. Whatever one may feel towards such a role, the holder of such a social position would surely display far more subtlety than that shown by Dawn French who seems to go out of her way to portray the Duchess as a totally boorish character.<br /><br />Dessay chooses to bring a particularly energetic approach to the role which she sings very accurately. This will not come as a great surprise to those who have seen her in other roles. Whether this approach to Marie appeals will be largely a matter of taste and there will be as many who find this funny as those who find it too hyperactive to be effective. Ciofi, on a rival set in my opinion, and I stress that it is a personal opinion, is far subtler in both her acting and range of vocal skill/expression. Florez takes the role of Tonio in both sets and is in equally fine voice on both occasions.<br /><br />The recording of this issue is very fine. The imaging is crisp with involving camera work and the sound is presented in good quality surround and stereo formats. Providing that the Duchess of Crakentorp and Dessay's very energetic approach to the role of Marie are not areas of doubt, this issue will give pleasure and satisfaction.<br /><br />However it is worth mentioning that there is choice available in an equally good recording. The rival set with Ciofi was reviewed in magazines such as The Gramophone as definitive when it was first issued only a few years ago. It is a great shame that it now seems to have been by-passed by this slightly more recent version. My personal preference is to buy the Ciofi set which I personally find to be more musical and therefore more enjoyable while being just as well recorded.<br /><br />At the end it is all a matter of taste and either issue will appeal according to personal preference rather than more measurable criteria. My own personal view is that this is worth 4 stars and the Ciofi set is worth 5.<br /><br />............................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />Again, Giles, I agree with you on every point.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this sharpener and recieved it within 5 days of ordering which is much faster than the usual month from most of my orders.  I did not like the idea of a fixed angle but when using it I realized it was a good stable angle that fit nicely with most of my knives.  Small and light weight It fits in pockets easily and I sometimes forget its even there.  I have not personaly used the lanyard hole but it is there and a big enough that a small D ring could fit through it.  The extendable round diamond point is great for serrated edges and with a dab of oil the whole system could but a decent edge on any blade.<br /><br />Great Price<br /><br />Great Portability

B001CZVVUU|5.0|Like the Donizetti Love Potion, this also teams up Villazon and Netrebko to completely believable effect. Both are in good voice although there are a few early signs of the vocal strain which has recently caused Villazon problems leading to unreliable engagements. These are not of any real significance here though and should not affect any purchasing choice. The problem may stem from his apparent reluctance to hold back his enthusiasm to deliver fully in performance rather than saving his voice whenever possible. This is good for his audiences but is a potentially heavy long term price for Villazon. He certainly gives 100% here.<br /><br />The setting is updated to the 1950's, but both Villazon and Netrebko have an aura about them that suggests a modern coupling would be appropriate. They are especially vibrant together and are clearly of an appropriate age for each other dramatically. This is a great advantage in any opera but is especially beneficial in this setting. Netrebko brings a dramatic aura of both glamour and decadence to her part and is in particularly good voice. The part seems made for her.<br /><br />All the supporting roles are well sung and convincingly portrayed by Christof Fischesser, Alfredo Daza, Remy Corazza, Arttu Kataja, Hanan Alattar, Gal James, Silvia de la Muela and Mattias Vieweg although inevitably the limelight is dominated by Anna Netrebko and to a lesser extent, by Rolando Villazon.<br /><br />The orchestra is also on top form under the sparkling direction of Barenboim.<br /><br />The recording offers excellent surround sound in DTS 5.1, PCM 5.1 as well as stereo. The camera work is sympathetic with a nice balance of close detail and more distant shots. As another reviewer has remarked, it is vital that good singing is backed up by good acting in opera especially when the storyline is so slight and we are certainly offered a combination of fine singing and acting in this case. Fortunately we live in an age when the old stand and deliver approach has been replaced by far better stage training and camera awareness and that is what we get here.<br /><br />In general terms, although I personally like the modern setting, I feel that there will be those who would prefer a more traditional staging and it should be noted that this production may not therefore be to everyone's personal taste. The musical values remain excellent however whatever views one may have on production choices and this performance certainly went down well with the audience. Providing that purchasers are prepared to accept the period updating to the 1950's this disc should give considerable pleasure. With that proviso in mind, it seems reasonable to suggest that 5 stars is a fair rating for those in sympathy with this modernised concept and that those who would reject that should look elsewhere for their choice of Manon.er approach has been replaced by far better stage training and camera awareness and that is what we get here.<br /><br />In general terms, although I personally like the modern setting, I feel that there will be those who would prefer a more traditional staging and it should be noted that this production may not therefore be to everyone's personal taste.

B000VJ271A|3.0|I have owned both this and the rival Villazon recording with Netrebko as his partner. As happened in his very successful performance of Donizetti's Love Potion with Netrebko, the two are able to spark off each other in an altogether more natural way. They are also able to sustain that level whereas in this performance the levels are rather more variable.<br /><br />The McVicar production here is basically set in period but does not rise to the heights of his remarkable Rigoletto at the Royal Opera or his Le Nozze de Figaro at Glyndebourne.<br /><br />This is possibly the best of the Massenet operas and does at least avoid the problems of Puccini's ending of the similar story with Manon's death in the Florida desert! The, perhaps controversially updated setting of the Villazon/Netrebko with Barenboim at the helm, is still for me the best bet as I feel the musical values are more reliable. In this I am not alone and I would suggest looking at the reviews of that set before buying this.<br /><br />Otherwise the sound here is well recorded both visually and sonically and the camera work is sympathetic.<br /><br />............................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />The Florida desert?

Puccini clearly had no idea of American geography and this is a particularly blatant example of geographic and consequential dramatic nonsense!

0007430671|5.0|The story of Saxon England continues with the death of King Alfred and the battle for the throne and for all of Saxony England. This is a very well written and adventurous tale of a fictional character (Utred) believably set in the English world of AD 800's. Many of the other characters were real folks and those who love historical fiction will like this story. This book of the series does carry more sexual comments and profanity than past books in this series (which is disappointing to me), but nonetheless does relate the life conditions and struggles of both Danes and Saxons accurately in the time and place. The audiobook I ordered from another seller through Amazon did take an entire month to reach me even though I live in the same state (Indiana) as that distributor. This has been my only disappointment.

I don't care about the S and M stuff, I'm not a prude--it's just depressing that this comical,poorly written TRASH is getting any traction. What a disappointment when there are so many other deserving authors writing really beautiful books who could use the financial support to continue to create art. Life is too short to drink bad wine--and life is too short to waste reading trash. For those of you who just want to understand popular culture, I would recommend getting the book at the library for free and not contributing one cent of your money to the author or to the publisher of such trash. At this point in the book's publishing history this would merely be a symbolic protest as I'm sure the writer and publisher are laughing all the way to the bank, but it's what I would recommend...

He's made his way to favorite author status in a remarkably short time, to join Kurt Vonnegut, Fyodr Dostoyevsky, and Diana Wynne Jones. He's our Oscar Wilde, with an R rating. Choke has every ounce the brutal sarcasm and psychological torment of The Picture of Dorian Gray, but with teeth. Passages will make you recoil and cringe, passages verging on pornographic, verging on psychotic. Yet never exploitative. Never overdone. The explicit excesses of the book only serve to make Victor's pathos more real as he struggles to reconcile his tumultuous childhood with a cruel and bleakly disappointing adulthood. As with all Palahniuk's heroes, he is outwardly a complete cad, inwardly a broken toy. The plot takes you through Victor's struggles to support his dying mother, dropping you off at an ending that is neither happy nor sad nor definitive, but ever hopeful.    Plot (5/5): Palahniuk is a master of the nonlinear. The book alternates between first-person narration of Victor's current life, mingled with shocking facts and back-alley philosophy, and third-person accounts of Victor's childhood, told by a cold and loathing narrator. The jumps allow us to piece Victor's life together, observing his pathology while simultaneously glimpsing its origins. It's both horrifyingly beautiful and tragic. The turn is psychotic, of course, and leaves both reader and Victor lost and reeling. We break as he breaks. It's a fast moving read, even when it seems that little movement occurs.    Concept (5/5): A sex addict feigns choking to collect money for the treatment of a mother who kidnapped and abandoned him repeatedly as a child. And it only gets weirder from there. But, it works. It feels authentic, even at its most ridiculous. The satire is so sharp that you feel these people and situations probably exist out there somewhere, with different names and faces. Just ridiculous enough to make the truest of points.    Characters (5/5): Deeply flawed and deeply heroic, Victor is the crux of the piece. You love him even as he's doing the most dastardly of deeds. He's the lost puppy you warn your teenager daughter away from. His best friend, Denny, is a great supporting character with a pathology of his own. He's a foil to Victor, no less broken but differently manifested. Victor's mother is talked about more than she talks; she's the perfect villain that only her own child could find sympathetic. As for Paige Marshall - she's wonderfully fanatic. These are all extreme caricatures of people who, like the plot, are just ridiculous enough to be real.    Style (5/5): Effusive, is a great word. Palahniuk gushes. He gives you lists and lists of examples of the worst sex offenders, the injustices at Colonial Dunsboro (theme park of doom), the indiscretions of Victor's past. It's gritty and doesn't shy away from very explicit material. If you can decide, for a moment, to set aside your ideas of morals and creeds, it's addictive. And if you don't mind that it sticks up the gears of the plot sometimes. It's not a thriller; it moves quickly if you want to soak up the ideas, but if you're looking for something more focused on plot progression, it's not for you.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The final book did not disappoint! It gets off to a slow start, but the conspiracy gets even more complex. The characters get richer, the plot gets deeper, and Larsson manages to make his characters heroes without being cliches. It's a shame there will be no more books from him. Lisbeth Salander is a champion for women, despite her social awkwardness and unique moral code.
030758836X|2.0|This book would have been a five star read. It had everything going for it: a tight plot, characters that hooked me and a real need to find out what happens. And then I get to the ending and it just sucked. There is no other way to say it. As a reader who stayed with the characters, even when they were very unlikable, I think I deserved more than the ending I was given. Perhaps the author thought she wa being coy, but it just didn't work that way. It came across as rude, not coy.

B00280LYIC|5.0|Okay, my name's Heather and this series is, like, my FAVORITE EVER!!!<br />It is about a sixth grader named Percy Jackson. He is getting crankier each day at his dormitory and is about to be kicked out...again. Then he goes on a beach vacation. One night his best friend crashes into his overnight cabin at the beach and tells them to run 'cause there's a Minotaur chasing them. Percy finds out Grover, his friend , is a satyr! Then they have to stop the car. The monster vaporizes Percy's mom and he's so angry he just has to kill the Minotaur with bare hands.<br />They're at the base of Half Blood Hill and Percy goes on quest. Zeus's master lightning bolt has been stole  and it's Percy's job to find it and return it back to Lord Zeus. He chooses Annabeth, a senior girl at Camp Half-Blood. They go on the quest, follwing the Oracle's prophecy.<br />After the quest, Percy finds out he's the son of Poseidon, the sea god.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read a little blurb in Entertainment Weekly about Hugh Howey and his novel, \\"Wool.\\" I thought it seemed worth giving a try. But, wow, I was blown away by this story!  Howey has so completely created an incredibly real future society and world that I got totally lost in it for days.  I found it nearly impossible to put this book down, and was finding myself staying up until the wee hours of the morning just to keep reading.  It is the sort of story that slowly grips you, the first chapter or so, is a little unclear as the action just begins without filling the reader in on what everything means. But that is part of what I loved about this book, part of what makes it feel all the more believable and real. Howey doesn't over-explain, which can feel so insulting as a reader, he just lets you follow the characters through their everyday lives, and you learn how this world works as you go. In terms of that element of realness, a lived-in, dirty future, it made me think of Star Wars (the story has NO similarities to Star Wars, just the feel), in just this complete other world that feels so real, not perfectly constructed and sterile. The characters are fantastic, living, breathing, thinking people. I am so excited for more people to read this story and get to know this world Howey created. And I can't wait to see what comes of Ridley Scott's interest into turning this into a film.

1401937268|1.0|\\"The first deck of tarot cards that is 100 percent gentle, safe, and trustworthy1\\" !!!???<br /><br />This is simply to fool people big time. I practice Tarot, and any cards are just a tool. They are made of paper. Just because it comes from Doreen Virtue does not make the deck any more gentle, safe, and trustworthy! It is the peoples intention that makes a deck of cards good or bad. Please - this deck is not more right or wrong than any other deck of cards.<br /><br />(This reminds me of the short tale by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen - \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\". The people who want to be fooled is getting fooled.)

B005EWDA9M|4.0|By the end of book two I was thoroughly sick of all the constant repetition and the weird Japanese sex/ female body obsession. Luckily book 3 pulled it all together nicely. Being old enough to have read the original 1984 when it was still in the future I found this book interesting, easy to read. Interesting concept about climbing down a ladder into an alternate reality but as I've mentioned there was so much regurgitating and repeated explanations in the 2nd book I almost didn't bother finshing it.  Glad I stuck with it to the end though
B006OCM0G0|1.0|the game is stupid to me and pretty much boring if u want a game then play pet shop story or bakery story
1400052181|4.0|This book was enjoyable and interesting, and had just the right level of science for most readers to be able to easily comprehend.  It also, surprisingly, has humor and levity at times, which helps defuse some of the seriousness of the subject.  Likewise, there are some very poignant and touching moments that bring Henrietta, her family, and the people that work with her cells to life.  In particular, it's very touching when one of the scientists, Christoph, shows Deborah her mother's cells for the first time.<br /><br />On the other hand, I feel she goes too far with the digressions on Henrietta's kids; this is marketed as a book about Henrietta and her contribution to science, but easily more than 50% of the book is taken up by her children and their lives and reactions to their mother's cells.  It really gets old at times, often losing it's moorings to the primary plot line.  Furthermore, when I read some of the one star reviews when I was only part-way through the book, I wondered why people had such strongly unsympathetic reactions to her kids...now I see why.  I was prepared to cut them a lot of slack, as I can understand why they would be upset.  I am not sure if they are as unsympathetic as they come off, or if the author is at fault, but by the end I wanted to tell them to \\"get over it\\".  The sons wanting to sue is understandable enough (although why no one ever told them they have no cause of action I can't imagine), but Deborah's hysterics border on the ridiculous at times.  She gets hives over her mothers cells, really??  She really comes off as a drama queen (although from some of what the author says, I do wonder if she has some mental health problems, in which case the paranoia etc is a little more sympathetic).  While I was gratified to see her educating herself, much of the rest of the story of her and her mother's cells really got old; the paranoia, the hives, etc. all got old and seemed a little ridiculous at times.  Beyond that, I can't help but wonder how much of the family stuff was added just to make this long enough to truly call it a book.<br /><br />I am also very glad she has the afterward on ethics; I am sure most people without a bioethics background reading the book would have been left feeling very adrift without it.  Furthermore, I think it was important to ground Henrietta's story in the overall issue of ethics.  It definitely would not have been the book that it is without that.<br /><br />Other than that, it was a great read, very interesting and engaging.  The first third or so, Henriett's life and death, was fascinating, as was learning about the impact of her cells and the advances in cell culturing.  The stuff with her family could have (and probably should have) been pruned back significantly and the book would not have been any the worse for wear, in my opinion.wonder how much of the family stuff was added just to make this long enough to truly call it a book.<br /><br />I am also very glad she has the afterward on ethics; I am sure most people without a bioethics background reading the book would have been left feeling very adrift without it.

For what it is, it works, but I need to have my calender up to date on all devices and it fails that with the fire. If that's fixed, this will be a 5 star app.
1419703692|5.0|I wasnt quite sure what I was getting when I purchased this book. I was even thinking about going to my nearest bookstore to purchase it so that I could look at it in person. However, I decided just to buy the book since I am a huge Batman fan. Anyways, the book is fantastic. The photographs in the book are top notch and really show some other sides to the film. If you like Batman, Chris Nolan, or just film in general, you owe it to yourself to pick up this book!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I think I screamed in vain too reading such drivel, although I suspect from different motives from the lip biting heroine of this travesty of \\"erotic literature\\".

B006ZZANG0|4.0|Rufus Wainwright returns in top-notch from with 2012's [[ASIN:B0073J9SGS Out of the Game]].  Produced by standout producer Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse most notably), Out of the Game is one of the years most pleasantest surprises.  The majority of the album niches itself into a blue-eyed soul style that suits the singer-songwriter perfectly. Wainwright doesn't concede his indie-/alternative pop sensibilities, yielding plenty creative, well conceived singer-songwriter moments.<br /><br />\\"Out of the Game,\\" the brilliant first single, heads up the album.  Wainwright's lead vocals are capable, and his use of soulful background vocals is superb (Kevin Keys, Angee Blake & Charysse Blackman).  Well written and soul-sensible, \\"Out of the Game\\" is a `home run' regardless of its title.<br /><br />\\"Jericho\\" doesn't miss a beat, delivering horns to amp up the soulful vibe.  While there is no concrete chorus, Wainwright makes lines `similar' to create a hook sensibility (\\"I keep think that you are going to...,\\" i.e.). The bridge section is dramatic and well conceived, overall helping to make \\"Jericho\\" a solid follow-up to the superb title cut.<br /><br />\\"Rashida\\" eclipses the great \\"Jericho,\\" hearkening back to 1950s-60s soul for its production inspiration.  Set in 6/8 time, \\"Rashida\\" has the stylings of soul written all over it.  The brilliant use of dirty, dusty sounding synths and minimalistic ostinato piano lines seal the deal.  Nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />\\"Barbara\\" cedes little momentum, featuring more lush production, buttressed by a solid bass line, soulful guitar riffs, and lovely background vocals.  \\"Barbara\\" is all you could ask of a mid-tempo soul cut in 2012.  After all, with R&B's pop-leanings in 2012, something the likes of the blue-eyed soul characterizing \\"Barbara\\" makes one yearn for the classics.<br /><br />\\"Welcome to the Ball\\" features Memphis soul-styled grooves, not unlike the music of soul legend Al Green.  Michael Leonhart adds an assortment of horns (trumpet, mellophone, and flugelhorn) that further enhance the orchestration. The orchestral, reverb-heavy section is a high point here, not to mention the general use of synthesized strings that sound pretty natural.<br /><br />\\"Montauk\\" shows off Wainwrights melodic sensibilities as a vocalist, delivering one of the album's more haunting melodic lines incorporating a jazz-like lick.  Additionally, \\"Montauk\\" uses some synths here, differentiating it in sound from previous cuts.  Wainwright handles acoustic piano duties here, which complements well with the synths.<br /><br />\\"Bitter Tears\\" changes pace with more driven synths, reminiscent of the 1980s and contrasting the more soulful means employed by the majority of this effort.  \\"Bitter Tears\\" may not be a favorite necessarily, but the sound palette is rich if nothing else.<br /><br />\\"Respectable Dive\\" clocks in at just under five minutes, delivering the album's lengthiest cut (prior to the closer \\"Candles\\").  While length is a slight drawback, Wainwright's vocal performance is solid.  Additionally, the production is well executed, adding a ukelele to the mix to give a different timbre.  The brushes used on the drums initially are a very musical move as well, reminding the listener how accomplished Wainwright and his fellow musicians are.<br /><br />\\"Perfect Man\\" speeds up the tempo following the slow pace of \\"Respectable Dive.\\"  The songwriting is compelling and creative here.  Wainwright's sister, Martha, contributes backing vocals.<br /><br />\\"Sometimes You Need\\" shows Wainwright's restraint, but in a positive light.  The cut opens with rhythmic acoustic guitar and subtle electric guitar lines. Gradually, synthesized instruments add a lovely timbre.<br /><br />\\"Song of You\\" opens a bit unsettling, but positively eliminates any sense of `predictability.' When the cut does settle in, the school is `old-school' and extremely soulful.  Wainwright brings back the superb trio of backing vocals that accentuated \\"Out Of The Game.\\"<br /><br />Closing cut \\"Candles\\" is the lengthiest, but actually quite enjoyable.  Incorporating accordion (Anna McGarrigle) as well as a bag piper (John-Angus Smith), there is plenty of ideas and sounds to latch onto.  In addition, Wainwright brings in the family to back him (including Loudon Wainwright III and once again Martha Wainwright).  The cut is mysterious and solid.  The backing vocals are lush and filled with reverb giving off an ethereal sound.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B0073J9SGS Out of the Game]] is a brilliant album.  Oft-times reviewers get caught up with the major releases and end up `sleeping' on some smaller ones.  Often, it is the smaller, less hyped releases such as Out of the Game that easily top the `best of the year' list.  This effort easily has a spot on that list for 2012.ed \\"Out Of The Game.\\"<br /><br />Closing cut \\"Candles\\" is the lengthiest, but actually quite enjoyable.

B006XOBFJC|5.0|I am a big fan of the others who have taken time to write in depth reviews about this very special recording of the RING. Each one has much detail and specifics about this recording, so I will not repeat them here.  I read them all before finally arguing with myself that I 'needed' a 23rd representation of THE RING in my collection. I believe the my collection of operas has more recordings of WALKUERE than any other opera. I approached this recording having owned the RCA CD of excepts. Nothing prepared me for the freshness of conception, beauty of tone, and depth of understanding in this RING, much more than a musical rendering of notes and tempi. Janowski understands. He truly does, and because of his innate understanding of the meaning behind the music, I feel that I am fed in a very special and careful way while the flow of the music is very personal. It is not like any other interpretation and therefore means even more to me, having grown up with VonKarajan/Solti, who seem to resemble each other as they dwell on similar wavelengths, though with differences in articulation. They both employ a mammoth orchestra and chorus to give us the most epic version possible. Huge voices dominate. This RING with Janowski, feels like the best quality one would find in an opera house with an large sized pit orchestra instead of a full Philharmonic. Yet the Staatskapelle Dresden is still one of the most famous and long lived ensembles to be found, and the way the musicians articulate Janowski's interpretation shows an aristocratic and knowing hand in the forming of this RING. I enjoyed so many parts of the performance and found myself continually surprised by the newness of the music when being put forward with care and a loving sense of fulfillment. The voices are almost all of middle weight. All of these singers I have followed since my school days and was quite aware of their careers. What a surprise to find a number of them in this music! Dramatic intent seems the guiding principal for everyone. The involvement is contagious. I find myself swept away by the intensity that is not forced, much more, allowed to unfold. I listened to quite a number of passages repeatedly, trying to take it all in. Happily, since I now own it, I can put it out whenever I would like. The biggest voices have a very special way with this music, yet they do not eclipse what I have found here. The specificity of pointing the words and the intentions behind the dialogues and monologues are among the very best. I would tell a lot of people to get this RING as a first one. Not an only one, yet at this price, this is a fantastic place to start exploring one of the few masterpieces in which I am open to hearing all who wish to share in this music.incipal for everyone.

0061692042|3.0|Obviously Richard Ford is an accomplished author, but this book never grabbed me.  From the first sentence, a major plot point is revealed, and basically the impetus for the entire novel.  The book is broken up into three parts in the life of Dell Parsons, a introspective, naive, teen in 1960.  I enjoyed Part 1 the most (although it took 100 pages for the \\"event\\" to occur), but found part 2 uninteresting, somewhat disjointed (Must have been how Dell felt!), and confusing.  I never really felt anything for Dell, as I found him weak and somewhat boring.  I probably would have preferred the story be told through the eyes of his twin sister, who led a MUCH more interesting life.<br /><br />The prose is beautiful and lyrical, but I would often find the same sentiments said in one chapter, echoed in consequent chapters, which seemed repetitive. Yes, Dell was the product of some bad decisions, but I never really felt invested in what happened to him, making it not so much an enjoyable read.

B00132S74A|5.0|Imagine waking up on the floor of the Men's Room in a train station and you do not know who or where you are. This is the start of Ken Follett's spy thriller novel set in America at the start of the Space Race in 1958. The plot revolves around the launching of the first Explorer satellite aboard the Jupiter-C rocket and a possible sabotage involving conspiracies, spies, patriots and some interesting \\"turns\\" around the storyline.<br /><br />This novel made some improvements over Mr. Follett's previous literary techniques. I like the way he started each chapter with slow unfolding description of Jupiter-C rocket from the engines to the satellite enclosed within and described it in technical and historical perspective. In addition, his technique of character development to include the \\"hidden\\" story line by alternating chapters going from discussing the relationships of the main characters when they were together at college before and just up to the start of WWII and \\"jumping\\" forward to the present story in 1958.<br /><br />Having read many novels (\\"Triple\\" & \\"Eye of the Needle\\" etc.) from this author just after they were published, I had somehow accidently missed this novel having been absorbed in his historical series. If you like his spy thriller style, I highly recommend this book. It is a quick read and a page turner!

B007P6PLDI|4.0|Pisces Iscariot was, hands down, my favorite album by the Pumpkins and probably my favorite album of the 90s.  While the bombast of Siamese Dream and the stylistic schizophrenia of Mellon Collie both were wonderful and found their way into my CD player very often, Pisces is the one that I remember most fondly and have the easiest time listening to from start to finish.  Billy Corgan mentions something in the liner notes for this new Deluxe edition that makes sense: these were the songs that were made when the Smashing Pumpkins weren't trying too hard to be special.  There's something wonderfully organic and modest (a word that is not often used in conjunction with the infamous Billy Corgan) about these songs.  From the quiet, demo feel of Soothe to the frenetic Frail and Bedazzled, Pisces Iscariot is filled with songs that are powerful but humble.  And finally, my favorite song on the album, Whir, gets some of its due praise by Billy in the new liner notes.<br /><br />However, something is fishy with the Deluxe edition.  Yes, it was remastered, and in most cases the remastering is quite subtle.  This is good; the less fiddling with an epic song like Starla, the better.  But be warned before you listen to the third song, Plume, especially if you are as familiar with the album as I am.  I'm not sure if the vocal track was substituted with an alternate version from the original recording sessions or with a brand new vocal by Billy, but it certainly isn't the original one.  And in my opinion it's far worse.  The repeated \\"bring me down\\" lyrics are inexplicably missing from the end of the song (to bring out the guitar solo more maybe?), even though they're still included in the lyrics sheet in the booklet.  I guess it's a small price to pay to have this reissue, and Plume isn't my favorite song anyway, but to someone who knows the original album inside and out it's quite jarring.<br /><br />The bonus content is for the most part great.  The DVD of VERY old concert footage is a lot of fun, and the cassette tape that's in the set is just awesome and brings you back to the Pumpkins' early days of trying to score a record deal.  The second CD contains a mish-mash of original and remixed b-sides and rarities, and while some are fantastic, others are head-scratchers.  Much like Plume on the main disc, Billy for some reason decided to sing over much of the original vocals to Glynis and the new vocals most definitely do not improve the song.  There's also some dimension that is lost in the new digital transfer.  Some of the very old songs like My Dahlia just sound flatter on this CD than they do on my old bootlegs.  All in all it's an unfortunate mixed bag in what should be a stellar package.<br /><br />Don't let the odd choices or sometimes less-than-great transfers stop you from purchasing what is overall a very pretty, fun, and good-sounding package for one of the best albums the Pumpkins ever made (and to think it's a B-side album!).  Just don't expect perfection, either.

B005FITIDC|1.0|This movie is about the true story of Sam Childers, a former drug-dealing criminal who eventually \\"converted\\" to Jesus, became a preacher  and went to mission to Africa in order to help orphans and people in a developing country.<br />He indeed raised money for the orphans and was the promoter of many humanitarian works, but he did not behave as a Christian.<br />Throughout the movie, after his \\"conversion\\", he used violence as a way to achieve his goals, and answered evil with evil, violence with violence disobeying to the Scriptures.<br />Waching the movie, I had the impression that Sam's attitude had not changed, he used the war in Sudan as an excuse to pour out his rage and violence, twisting the message of Jesus.<br />Sam's \\"mission\\" turned into an obsession that almost destroyed his family, a family that he negleted.<br />Sam's also became violent with his best friend and did not help him when he was in need.<br />If you are looking for a movie full of action, this is the movie for you, but if you are looking for the love that Jesus preaches in the Bible and an example of how a Christian should behave, avoid it.

0307341577|4.0|Libby Day, twenty-four years earlier at age seven, was the only survivor of the brutal murder of her mother and two sisters in their rural, rundown Kansas farmhouse. Most significantly, it was her testimony that put her older brother Ben in prison for the crime; but after all these years, there are doubters. While the book focuses on Libby's awful life since that fateful night, more broadly, it is an unrelenting look at rural life at its worse: the broken families and grinding poverty when weather, market forces, contemptible people, and poor decisions collide, the harsh judgments of a close community, the condescension of the haves towards the have-nots, the turn to destructive behaviors in the absence of more constructive alternatives, etc.<br /><br />The impetus for this story is a letter that Libby receives from the Kill Club, a group, mostly women, who want to reopen cases of murderers, in this case, Ben Day. Libby has never even been bothered to visit her brother in prison, but the Kill Club is willing to pay her for what she knows or can find out about the case. She has been living off of a Libby Day fund that the public contributed to in the years after the murders, but now the fund has dried up. Perhaps surprising to her, she finds that her interest is piqued.<br /><br />The story is told in alternating chapters focusing on Libby in the present and the fateful day in the past told from the perspectives of Ben and her mother. It is disturbing to see Ben succumb to the persistent forces mentioned earlier, including the demonic demands of a rich, bored girl one year older than Ben. Slowly the story unfolds as Libby tracks down several individuals to fill in the gaps of the accounts from the past, and not without considerable risk in some cases.<br /><br />The story is an attention grabber: watching the stumbling, yet inexorable, actions that will result in the murders of a family. The mystery is in which aspects of sorriness will cause whom to end up in that house on that night.  The author certainly has a gift for language, though at times perhaps a little exaggerated. Libby at the very start says \\"I have meanness inside me, real as an organ. Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it.\\" In actuality, Libby is a depressed, suicidal female with poor skills, social and otherwise, who is a threat to no one but herself. None of the characters are particularly compelling, though they do draw some sympathy. One is left to ponder whether this entire scenario could have been prevented.ouse on that night.

0425263908|5.0|I was a fan of Fifty Shades of Grey but some parts of the books made me cringe and think, how is that attractive. There was much less cringing in Bared to You. It kept me hooked and I was disappointed when I saw that the sequel wasn't out yet. There are definitely many moments that were VERY similar to Fifty Shades, but those moments do not detract from how good the book is.
B007I1Q4W2|4.0|When it comes to zombie films, there's only the basic scenario to set them apart and sometimes that's where the differences end. And then you have films that try to completely embrace their respective setting, and try to make a good movie in the process. DAWN OF THE DEAD embraced its critique of commercialism as its characters survived in a mall, THE WALKING DEAD embraced its southern setting, tackling racism, religion, etc. EXIT HUMANITY, begins just after the Civil War has come to a close, with a man coming home to find his family taken by the walking dead. Alone and still reeling from the atrocities he experienced during the war, he decided to make one last journey in an attempt to find peace.<br /><br />EXIT HUMANITY is not tongue-in-cheek and doesn't know the meaning of humor; this is a very dramatic take on a zombie infestation in post-war Tennessee. That in itself might sound a bit silly, but the filmmakers rightly keep the focus on the story, its characters, and the human drama that would emerge from such a situation. It really does take more inspiration from zombie stories of a more \\"serious\\" tone like THE WALKING DEAD.<br /><br />But unlike THE WALKING DEAD, EXIT HUMANITY arguably plays things safe. It doesn't fully embrace its setting as much as it should have, perhaps. It makes no mention of slavery, neither is there a strong connection to the war itself. For as serious as this film was attempting to be, it draws a line in a very unlikely place.<br /><br />All that aside, for an independent zombie film, the production qualities are top notch. The characters are well-acted and easy to care about, the zombie effects are very good, and the locations, costumes and weapons are authentic. The film is also narrated by Brian Cox, who does a fantastic job throughout. (No surprise.) All in all, this is just a tremendous film for the budget that it had, and the filmmakers deserve all kinds of praise for getting the very most out of what they had to work with.<br /><br />There are many, many zombie movies out there, but I'd argue that this is perhaps one of the best in recent years. It walks the line between being too serious at times (the main character's penchant for screaming in torment nearly a dozen times was a tad off-putting), and not serious enough (ignoring the aftermath of the Civil War in a lot of respects). But regardless, EXIT HUMANITY clearly had a lot of love and talent behind it. If you're a fan of the zombie genre, this will likely be a refreshing change of pace. Personally, I wouldn't mind a sequel.<br />There are many, many zombie movies out there, but I'd argue that this is perhaps one of the best in recent years.

1401235417|5.0|As Rises ends and promises the end to a legend, the comics continue and we get one of the most fascinating Batman tale that we have had in a very long time. Here, we have a reinvented Bruce Wayne, much smarter, bolder, and edgier than he already is, trying to find the identity of a killer who seems to be much more formidable and cunning than even he is. As the pieces start to fall into place, a past he long denied is mysteriously coming back to finish him. With a brand new villain and interest in the Batman comics (and in the Batman character himself) I can honestly say that this has been one of the most unexpected surprises of the New 52. Even though Batman is already a popular mainstream character and his stories are usually well written and very good, I think I speak for a lot of readers out there when I say that we never expected this story to be THAT GOOD. A worthy addition to the history of Batman and the Bat Family, with amazing art and a story that promises many interesting developments to come, I cannot recommend this chapter of the Dark Knight's Legend enough. Buy it.

030758836X|2.0|I REALLY do not understand all the accolade given to this book. I am not finished with it yet but am itching to write the review. I was very much looking forward to this \\"suspenseful and twisted psychological thriller\\". I think the book is incredibly boring. Mind you I am actually listening to it during work commute versus actually reading it and often times the narrator makes or breaks the book. In this case the narrators definitely contribute to irritation. They read very slowly as if to someone with comprehension problems and at time they sound like their mouths are full of spit. Never mid all that. I find the book incredibly slow paced with pages and pages of unnecessary details that are often repeated and boring conversations. It seems none of the characters can get to the point. There is a plot twist thankfully, because I was truly getting ready to stop listening to this boredom and move on to other things. Even with the plot twist I have completely lost interest in what is going to happen. It also does not help that none of the characters are even remotely likeable or original. To me, this book is neither a page turner like say Harlan Coben books are nor, a procedural novel with \\"make sense\\" plots like say Michael Connolly. I just don't understand all the excitement. Based on the ratings it appears I am the minority on this. I rarely write review but this time waster got me pretty agitated.

B008JH5CVS|4.0|This movie had good action scenes as well as great computer graphic effects and it was surprisingly funny which I did not expect but I really enjoyed it all the sane and I recommend it to anyone into sci-fi action films with comic relief. I hope whoever watches Lockout after reading this enjoys it as much as my wife and I did. The picture and sound quality of the HD version was extremely good over a wifi connection to a PS3 system and it was also in full wide screen without the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen so you had a larger picture to watch and was as clear as any 1080i blueray discs I've watched on the sane TV.

030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl, or the amazing saga of Amy and Nick, was hard to put down.  It truly kept me on the edge of my seat, anticipating what the characters would do next.  That's a good thing!<br /><br />But now that I am done, I cannot decide whether or not I'm satisfied with the ending.  And the ending of a book is sooo important, as all readers know!  This is a well-written and racy mystery that ends in, gosh, a kind of quiet desperation. Maybe that's apropos of its thinly veiled commentary on married life (while the author is supposedly happily married to the man of her dreams... hmm).  Though I'm not sure it was my favorite ending, however, I must bestow accolades for the quality of twisting plot, vivid characters, and solid prose that kept me riveted throughout the distressing tale.<br /><br />I'll try not to be spoilerish as I make a few comments.  This is an enthralling read to discover and unwrap on your own, so I don't want to ruin it for anyone. That said:<br /><br />- I am mad at Nick.  Furious, actually.  Sure, there was not too much else to be done once things got too far out of hand.  But there were opportunities ... missed opportunities for things to turn out differently.<br />- Like Amy, I watch enough police procedural shows (OK, not so closely and not so psychotically) to know that there should have been something that could have pointed the investigators in the right direction.<br />- Finally, I am no psychologist, like Amy's parents, but I'm thinking the final outcome is unlikely even in the most tidily constructed of fictional universes. Call me crazy (not psycho), but could life really go on the way it does in the end?<br /><br />All of this nail-biting angst, wondering if things should or could have gone differently, brings me to the conclusion that this is a terrific book.  Why?  Because I cared (still care, apparently) about the characters.  I'm sitting here wondering what they're up to now that the book has ended! That's true engagement of the reader, and that makes this book a success., and that makes this book a success.
B005LAII0I|2.0|At the beginning of the year we were teased with the prospect of two vastly different live action interpretations of the `Snow White' fairytale.  First released with the family oriented `Mirror Mirror', which looked to take a campy comedic approach and starred the rather washed up (yes, she's a 90's actress who has failed to deliver since her Oscar twelve years ago) Julia Roberts.  The second, which was to be released more in line with awards season, was the dark and fantastical looking `Snow White and the Huntsman' starring the world's favorite celebrity, Charlize Theron.<br /><br />I was holding out for the `Huntsman'.<br /><br />Sadly, the stars did not align for me and I had a pretty terrible month with stress filled work environment and sick children and so I never got around to seeing Theron scream her way to victory.  The reviews weren't kind anyways, so waiting for it to be released on DVD isn't that big of a deal, I guess.  My daughter happened to see a commercial for the DVD release of `Mirror Mirror' though, and she was spellbound.  She had to see it and so I buckled and rented it.  I really wasn't expecting much at all, and sadly, I didn't get much either.<br /><br />Good lord this movie is stupid.<br /><br />I understand that alterations need to be made to bring this classic story into the modern era.  No, this is a `modern interpretation' but what I mean is that to appeal to modern audiences they felt it necessary to alter aspects of the film.  Sadly, many of the alterations just don't work, and it wound up feeling silly for silly's sake.  The dialog is stilted and unfunny and no one can really deliver them with authority outside of Julia Roberts who is actually really funny here, especially towards the end of the film.  The rest of the acting is a sore spot, with the dead-eyed dull spirit known as Lily Collins completely ruining this film, and the adorable Armie Hammer embarrassing himself in more ways than one.  The dwarfs, all of them, are terrible actors and the alterations made to their characters were ridiculous, from the names (I wanted to punch the television) to their stilts.<br /><br />Visually, the film is appealing.  The sets and those costumes are delicious, but overall this is just a massive failure.  Tarsem has a track record of creating visually appealing films that don't quite fill in the other areas, but `Mirror Mirror' is his biggest misstep.  At the end of the day, the film is just dull.actors and the alterations made to their characters were ridiculous, from the names (I wanted to punch the television) to their stilts.<br /><br />Visually, the film is appealing.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|This film is a sickening, grotesque, and very unsettling piece of sci-fi / horror that will leave you breathless. This film will terrify, horrify, and amaze you with scenes that reach levels of suspense not reached since 1979's original 'Alien'. The visual effects are beautiful, the acting is fantastic (especially great Michael Fassbender), and nearly every scene is adrenaline-pinching. There is no doubt that this will end up being one of the best films of the year. This is definitely better than some of Scott's more modern movies (Gladiator, Hannibal, Robin Hood, etc.). He is a visionary of a director, and is one of the best in the business. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loved ALIEN.

B005LAIGSC|4.0|I just watched this movie last night and thought I would leave a review.  I cannot believe some folks give this thriller 1 or 2 stars.  No way!  First of all, Denzel cannot give a bad performance, and 2nd, it came across as a kind of a Jason Bourne storyline.  I'm not say that as a bad thing either.  We all love the Jason Bourne storys don't we?  Ryan did a very good job in his role, and as others have posted, the remaining cast members are all well season troops.  As a long time action film junkie I thought this movie delivered.  I got what I expected.  Worth to own and certainly worth a shot to rent.  The \\"bad\\" guy crew was certainly relentless in their attempts to capture Tobin Frost (Denzel).  Some very excellent fight and chase scenes.

Students will love the DVD.
B0058YPGL6|2.0|Let's get one thing out of the way before this review begins: A title means a lot in establishing what a show/movie/song is about to the audience.<br /><br />You look at any product released for sale and you'll see how true this is.<br /><br />- Being Human US/UK - A story about three roommates trying to live normal lives, despite being monsters.<br />- The Witcher 2 - A story about a monster slayer and his struggles within his world.<br />- Powerwolf/Night of the Werewolves - A song about the creation of werewolves, who emerge when the moon is full, and their impact on the populace.<br /><br />For Teen Wolf, the title immediately mishandles the impact it offers. Because it only tells you only what the main character is, not what the series is about, and immediately makes older viewers think of the two comedy films that 'inspired' this show. For the films, the reverse of this was true, because both MCs were teenage werewolves and the films focused on their stories as them. (College starts at 18 or sooner.)<br /><br />So, now that the title has mishandled some part of the impact of the show, let's move on.<br /><br />Right from the outset, Teen Wolf establishes itself as a horror/comedy double act, with the former being the catalyst for the teen drama and the humor resulting from it. However, it takes getting through a very convoluted first few episodes and set-ups to reach that point. While this isn't a bad thing in and of itself, the problem this creates is again brought back by the mishandle of the title. After the scenarios of the first few episodes, the shows begins to focus far less on the Teen Wolf Scott, and more on everything else around him and Stiles.<br /><br />Looking back, the only series on TV that has ever focused most on the titular werewolf character was Werewolf in the 90's. So, since Scott is in the same position as Eric, why isn't the show focusing more on his character? To be blunt, it's because he is one of the weaker, and least interesting, characters in the show.<br /><br />We have Jackson, who provides the strong willed, for a jock anyway, bully type who wants what Scott has.<br />We have Derek, who works as the tough love mentor figure for Scott.<br />We have Stiles, who provides the hijinks, and occasional advice.<br />We have Lydia, who always remains clueless to the events around her.<br />And then Allison, the love interest whose family are hunters by tradition.<br /><br />By contrast to these characters, Scott comes off as one of the weaker ones because his character is the one of the weak kid in school who gets both the curse and the perk of lycanthropy from the bite of another. While that sounds interesting in theory, the problem is the way the show presents this fact.<br /><br />Not only is this a trope of werewolf stories in general, like Cursed, but Scott almost never has to deal with the negative side effects of being a werewolf. At least to any extent that causes a lasting impact on those around him. What his condition does offer however is tension in his pursuit of romance with Allison, notably with her family and how they see werewolves.<br /><br />As a fan of Power Rangers, I can easily point to several characters from the series that had more personal dilemmas from being a Ranger, or not, than Scott does with lycanthropy in this show.<br /><br />- Billy from Zeo - Denies himself the right to be a Zeo Ranger, choosing to be the tech guy instead.<br />- Sky from SPD - Constantly looks down on Jack, a criminal who got the right of Red Ranger instead of him.<br />- Mack from Operation Overdrive - Learns that he is an android, changing his personality and his team's perception of him.<br />- Jen from Time Force - Has to deal with the death of her lover, his subsequent resurrection, and understanding her love towards Wes instead of Alex.<br />- Astronema from In Space - Questions who she really is after discovering Andros is her brother.<br /><br />Having a character with depth means you canfeel for them and root for them when things related to them turn sour. Scott, despite being the main character, doesn't share this trait with the other characters on the show. Aside from his love, and his life, what else does he have to lose? His place on the lacrosse team? Maybe his mother, who is his last relative? His friends? All of those are tropes of werewolf stories, but the latter two are the least developed until way later in the series. To be frank, those are the plots that should've been looked into the most, instead of left to come in towards the second half of the show. The former three make up most of the struggles, with only the lacrosse one lasting the longest or being the middle in development.<br /><br />If his lycanthropy was something that didn't just make him a sports star, and actually gave him something to struggle against, I could see less issues with those sub-plots.<br /><br />By contrast to Scott, Peter Hale, the Alpha, is a far more likeable and relate-able person. His family was murdered by rouge hunters who violated their own code of ethics, so to take his revenge, he tracks down and slays every person responsible for their deaths. In the process, drawing out the one person who made the final choice: Kate Argent. Talk about devoted. This guy I wanted to live in the end because I liked his story a lot more than Scott's. He had a drive to avenge his family, akin to the Old West kind of vengeance. Not something that rolls well in modern America, but would send a message either way.<br /><br />Now, onto the story.<br /><br />The pacing of this series is actually one of the better sides of it. Almost each episode has something happen to get the viewers hooked, and the overarching mystery of the Alpha was also fun. Even if I have to call BS on Peter using a burst of quick healing on his face burns. Being a fan of 24 as well, I cannot say this series terrified me as much as that show did, but the show did have some nice moments. When Kate gave Allison the amulet she was wearing the night of the arson, hinting that the Alpha could have gone after her instead. Or the entirety of Night School, which was a nice use of the location to set up a final stand scenario.<br /><br />However, I once again have to play the bad guy here. The problem with the story is it's a teen drama, meaning everything at the end will be resolved with little hang-over or true consequences related to any of the characters. It's a problem with teen related stories in general that gets put on a pedestal in this show, both with instances of plot convenience, and things that are based in terribly sketchy science.<br /><br />Scott suddenly realizing another werewolf exists just because Derek slashes him.<br />The Alpha being able to control him by howling next to him.<br />Derek using a plant that was already shot into his veins, and is killing him, as the catalyst to counter that very same plant.<br /><br />The number of Deus Ex Machina moments really start to show if you think about them.<br /><br />Throughout the series, we see things between characters rise, dip, and sometimes warp, but at the end, we see no real change. No real consequences. However, given how Season 2 starts, I'm willing to wager this was because Teen Wolf was originally a one-shot series, and even once it was confirmed that wasn't the case, the writers didn't go back and try correct this. Instead saving everything for Season 2, causing a massive bout of emotional whiplash.<br /><br />Which is why, when Season 2 came around, and even more so now, I am in the camp that said the series is over because no new stories could be told within the context of how Season 1 ended, without taking more focus away from Scott and his condition.<br /><br />Production-wise, Teen Wolf has some serious backing from MTV, which does help with the sets and the cinematography. What it doesn't help with however is the costuming and make-up effects. Feel free to argue that this is a TV series, meaning shelling out for costumes isn't as big a deal, but when a network like NBC can support something like Grimm, which has unique monsters every episode, I find that argument quite shallow.<br /><br />Where a network/production studio budgets its money in a series can show you where they're focusing their attention.<br /><br />For CSI, it was the CGI/live-action crime reels, forensics, and eventually crossovers.<br />For Power Rangers, it was big scale monster battles, new stories, and martial arts/weapon fighting.<br />For Teen Wolf? It's eye candy, pretty scenery, and OK writing.<br /><br />When I say 'eye candy', I doubt that needs much elaborating on. Like True Blood, Vampire Diaries, Jersey Shore and to an extent, Twilight, Teen Wolf belongs to a network that works best with leading roles given to great looking models, and the story having a lot of cuddling scenes. Hence why every male in the series, aside from Stiles, looks like a model, and the romance is a major focus. This becomes even more obvious in Season 2 when the main characters start disrobing more and the sensual scenes become more frequent.<br /><br />Don't believe me? Try watching Season 2 Episode 1 with the sound off and pay attention to what's on screen only. Also, read positive reviews of Season 1 for this show. Almost every single one will, without fail, mention this fact in some way. That Scott is cute, the cast looks great, certain things are sexy, ect, ect.<br /><br />While the films before also had romances involved, they had them as side-plots. Not a main one. Which circles back to the title once again. I believe the detractors of this series are completely correct about the misuse of the title. All things considered, it doesn't do the show any real justice and simply besmirches the original films with the use of the name.<br /><br />If I was to name this series, I'd use the phrase \\"The Howling\\" in some fashion instead. The reason is because those films also focused less on the werewolves and more with those who came close to them. Both in plot, and in sensual, terms.<br /><br />Final Rating - 4 out of 10<br /><br />The show isn't that great, all things considered. I'd call it competent, but not great. When I look at it, I can see some parts that work, but quite a lot that don't when you take the series apart and look at those segments.<br /><br />If I was to offer any piece of advice to the makers of this show as it is now, it would be this: Take a step back and stop trying to raise the proverbial bar so high with shock scenes. Because at some point, likely in Season 2, that bar is going to fall, hit your heads, and drop this show off MTV because things have gone completely bonkers and suspension of disbelief has left in the process.<br /><br />Bringing in so many plot conveniences, whipping around the emotions of your audience, and focusing too much on nice looking bodies isn't going to make you the next True Blood, or Twilight. Both of which I can see influences from in this series, even if some would like to say otherwise. TV is run by trends as much as games are, and you don't have to look hard to see it.
0345535421|5.0|\\"A Clash of Kings\\" is George R.R. Martin's sequel to his wildly successful novel, \\"A Game of Thrones\\".  And it is the second novel of five written so far in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.  Having read the first novel last winter, after watching the television show on HBO, I tried to read this novel with the television series running at the same time.  Unfortunately with work and family, that did not work out.  However, I had read reviews on how great the novel was, and I was not disappointed at all.  Martin continues the story of the various Kings and their personal quests in the land of Westeros.  I will not go further into the plot, as that has been covered multiple times here on Amazon.  However, I was excited to read the evolving stories of Jon Snow, Tyrion, Bran, Daenerys, Sansa, and of course Arya.  And we are introduced to new characters such as Davos, Jaqen H'Ghar, Lord Stannis, Roose Bolton, and many others.  And we get to see some characters cross the line of good and evil, such as Cersei, Jamie Lannister, Baelish, and the Hound.  The Battle of Blackwater was outstanding, and I loved visualizing it even more, especially after seeing the green \\"wildfire\\" on the television show.<br /><br />  All in all, this second novel had me continuing to want to flip the pages to see what happened next.  I often read at night, and found myself fighting to go to bed, knowing I needed some sleep for the next day of work.  My only real drawback of the book, is wanting to see more of Robb Stark.  Oh, and why has King Joffrey not been beheaded yet?  I look forwards to reading the third novel, as every one states that \\"A Storm of Swords\\" is the best novel of the series so far.  I cannot wait to read the further adventures of Tyrion, Jon, and Arya: my three favorite characters.
B00457WZEI|4.0|I saw the movie and parts of it made me think, wouldn't it be cool if the book was told from the point of view of the horse? I looked it up, and it was! Sold.<br /><br />Very clever way to tell the story. It was a quick, breezy read as Joey, the horse, tells us about his early life growing up on a farm with Albert until he is sold to the army and put to work in World War I. Whenever Joey is relating to individual human characters who care for him, like Captain Nicholls, Emilie, and Friedrich, and even Joey's best equine friend Topthorn, the story moves along at a gallop and I raced right through it. The actual war scenes, however, didn't hold my interest as much, but that could be more about my tastes than any fault of the writing. I was also mildly bothered by the frequent overlong paragraphs of dialogue that didn't sound natural and often would say the same thing three different ways.<br /><br />(PS: It's been pointed out to me that \\"Black Beauty\\" is also told from the POV of the horse. Good to know. I'll have to check that out too.)
2210754909|5.0|The delivery was fast.<br />I have just started to read the book. This reading was recommended to me by other AP French teachers, as I am always on the look out for authentic French materials to use in class. I also like to use reading texts with DVD to optimize students' learning and comprehension. The DVD with French audio is also available. I am pleased with this selection so far, and I would recommend it to francophiles and francophones for an easy and interesting material to read - for pleasure and/or use as an authentic French material in class.<br />A+ :D
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this game is free so its automatically awesome.  you drive turn and run over zombies.  its hard to get coins but at least its free.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|Although I'm not a literary fan of Sherlock Holmes or of past movies and television that the books inspired, I find the BBC series \\"Sherlock\\" to be entirely captivating.  My impression of the central figure is of a renegade detective, kinda like Batman, that uses his intellect to solve crime in an otherwise apathetic city occasionally troubled by super-villains, all set within a modern context meant to provide at least a level of realism so as to appeal to the largest audience possible.  I think it worked.<br /><br />A Scandal in Belgravia:  At first I was a little put off by the season opener but in retrospect I was struck by the logic of a real-life, female super-criminal potentially being on the pervy side which would represent her primary \\"power\\" of control in a male-dominated society.  This however gives Holmes something of an edge when dealing with said baddy, who was apparently intended by the writers to be irresistible but only elicits a \\"meh\\" from her brilliant adversary.  It's actually her wit and incessant texting that causes Holmes to eventually take enough interest to prompt the climactic and completely unexpected conclusion.<br /><br />Although I was hoping that the show might take a more supernatural direction in Hounds of Baskerville (I'm a fantasy lover after all), I thought this episode centered on a very clever plot coupled with the possibility of seemingly, unexplained phenomena unnerving an otherwise unshakeable Holmes, thus introducing an element of vulnerability to this character.  Not gonna spoil, but to refer back to the Batman analogy I'll mention a factor in this story that reminds me very much of one his arch-enemies (i.e. Scarecrow).<br /><br />The Reichenbach Fall:  I thought Moriarty was a rather disappointing arch-enemy not being very charismatic and a little on the femme side.  A sort of brilliant psychopath completely bored with life, he seemed more of the evil genius type and less the criminal mastermind and ultimately his role was (in my opinion) the only real blot on the series.  Otherwise an exceptionally thrilling and dramatic season finale with lots of twists and turns<br /><br />Doctor Watson is probably Sherlock's first real friend, with a relationship based on complementary personalities. For example, Holmes' apparent contempt for humanity, which he cooly acknowledges as sociopathic, is countered by Watson's compassionate tendencies, probably provoked by his own past sufferings, towards clients or just people in general.  Also, Holmes' single-minded brilliance can be more than a little off-putting to most people and again Watson helps to mitigate the effect and defend his friend on a rather frequent basis.  Regarding their unusual but obviously strong friendship, the recurring homosexual innuendos are a little annoying but I suspect they're there to enhance US appeal.<br /><br />Exceptional television, excellent premise, first-rate actors with filming style more like a movie than a TV series and we're already seeing knock-offs of Holmes' character on a handful of lame, US crime-dramas which I guess is the highest form of flattery.  Again, what would peeps in the US do for smart entertainment if it weren't for the BBC?  :o)(in my opinion) the only real blot on the series.

B0045NXMJE|5.0|I saw this movie once in Anchorage, Alaska in our independent movie theater. I fell in love with it right away. I had to have it. It is rated R, but it could be showed to a French class skipping a few scenes here and there when needed.<br />Highly recommended for movie fans :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very addictive. Very calming.  Lovely graphics. It is a  great casual game.  People who like to spend a bit of time with jigsaw puzzles would like this game.
1596434252|5.0|What a fantastic book!<br />I love examining the paper creations and how they work.<br />I could spend hours just playing with this book :)
B00006AW2P|4.0|I actually prefer the UK debut, which is almost the same as this album.<br />The UK album's best song, 'Mona' was deleted in favor of 'Not Fade Away'. 'Mona' had to wait for the following year for US release on the 'Now!' Lp.<br />The UK album cover also featured the photo shot of the band and nothing else, no group name or title, which was quite an innovative idea at the time. London Records threw this idea out the window, by having the group's name feature prominently, along with 'England's Newest Hitmakers', a statement which must have become dated within a week of coming out.<br />Putting that aside, the music's great, I like all the tracks, even the instrumental 'Now I've Got a Witness', a group jam that sounds like it was made up on the spot.<br />'Walking the Dog' was released as a single in Australia, and topped the charts there.
1419703692|5.0|A must have for anyone who is a fan of Nolan's Batman Trilogy.  Very in depth look behind the scenes that the DVD's/BR's lack.
030758836X|5.0|Hard to review this book with out giving something away and I don't want to spoil the fun for anyone. Just to say Gone Girl is a true psychological thriller, you will be guessing from page to page as to what happens next and most likely be wrong. I have recommended this book to everyone I talk about books and they all come back and say wow what a story. So if you need something to whisk you away for awhile I highly recommend.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|this would be better if we had more collages to choose from.... itz really cool but I want 2 put more pictures into it not just 10 or 11 but mabe MORE. sure get this app if you want... but dont get it if u want to make a big collage ..
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|the game is pretty cool I have always liked angry birds but playing this game I start to get bored but once in a while I still play it.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Though clearly the rating and the rest of the reviews have already bestowed immense praise upon this book, I felt compelled to add my own comments. This book, like many fantasy novels, follows a main hero, in this case Vaelin al Sorna, but you are also introduced to other characters that become as fully fleshed out and three-dimensional as the main character. The plot too managed to draw me in and I flew through the book with the need to discover it all. The magic system, unlike many others, does not make anyone omnipotent or invincible but it remains an active part of the story and a helpful aid to those who use it. Overall, this book will rank up top with my favorites and I will definitely keep track of this new author as I impatiently wait for the sequel!
B0086700CM|5.0|it is really fun. you get to find money and spend it on anything you want. It is fun you should get it plus its free!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is awesome its fun  where ever u go awesome my brother and sister like it but some of them are impossible to beat
B006O5YI7G|5.0|I started getting into newer western movies lately and I came away from this wanted to go out and find some more hidden gems.<br /><br />The story just grasped me from the beginning. Couple of twists and good use of horses. You'll understand when you watch the movie.<br /><br />Like westerns? Watch this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very good series! It's refreshing to watch a tv show that is not full of profanity and sex.  Very high marks for pbs.
B004PR71JC|5.0|MY DAUGHTER AND I WATCH RIO THE MOVIE OFTEN SO AS A RESULT WE KNOW ALL THE WORDS TO THE SONG.  THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST AMAZING SOUNDTRACK FOR AN ANIMATED MOVIE SO FAR. I LOVE ALL THE SONGS MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M IN rio!

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|My hustand and I rented this movie and it sat for weeks before we got around to see it.  I love all things sci-fy and everything that is out there, being a hippy and all.  So we sat down to watch it and it was awesome! It has many different metaphysical and mythological concepts.  The scenery was beautiful and the guy, well he wasn't hard on the eyes.  Well, the girl was ok too.
0425263908|5.0|This book is a really good read. It is well written and the characters are really likeable. If you enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey then you will also enjoy this book. Give it a try. You will not be disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|so much fun i got it to days ago and have been playing it non stop. it is so adictive. totally worth it to get it
B0072OFOM6|3.0|Like so many I loved Blood & Sand, and Gods of the Arena. However, I felt that this season lacked so much from the previous two Seasons. The storylines were rushed and left you scratching your head. There several frayed ropes that left you hanging for more. Liam, I'm sure is a fine actor, but lacks the compassion/conviction in his facial expressions that Andy (RIP) possessed. I found his acting a little dull in this role, and forgot about his character alot throughout. That's a bad thing when you forget about Spartacus' role in a Spartacus series.<br /><br />There was just too much going on at once and the plots were a little too telegraphed. I knew what was going to happen before it happened. Not nearly as suspensful as the first two seasons. Lots of creatve ways to die though.<br /><br />Lucy (F)Lawless was great as usual. I think they could have done more in 2-3 more episodes and sewn up some of the loose ends and character development; such as Sepius & Sepia, Nasir and his long lost Syrian brother, the Egyptian. I also hope that Liam can delve into character and get his exressions going for Season 3. I want more compassion/conviction/animal-survivor instinct...please!!
B007FH9GT2|2.0|I don't want to say that the movie was horrible, BUT it was dump down.  I'm not crazy about the violent scenes from the original movie, but it delivered a very strong message about the main character.  Also, this english version had to go back and give you flashes reminding you of things and over explained things that were best left to the imagination.  In addition it just extended a non existent relationship between the characters that, to me changed the flavor of the movie and the essence of the characters. This one draaaaaged..... The original movie, now that one is a GOOD movie! [...]
B0063GORYU|4.0|Enjoyable!  Easy to play with one suit,  yet you can change the settings to challenge yourself with more than one if you want.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|you people who cant get out of the game are dumb. its not that hard to figure it out. I like this game. its sweet. and its not that hard to avoid buying real money stuff. its fun. so get it.
B007T9UIMA|3.0|This video has made my daughter very happy. She has viewed several times with and without friends. It is a success for this young teenage female market. I still prefer Eric Clapton!!
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire is a great sequel to The Hunger Games. It gives you just enough information to keep you reading but never too much to spoil it for you. This one is definitely a page turner, it read it in 2 days compared to The Hunger games which took me a week. I love that the story line is not predictable and the \\"games\\" have many different twists and turns. Even if you havent read The Hunger Games, you will still be able to keep up with this novel.
0140187022|5.0|Loved this book! Much darker than I had remembered the movie to be (though I was much younger when I watched it and that's only to be expected with films from that time). Definitely would recommend!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|The first few times I played it on an iPad, I thought it was pointless. But now I cannot put it down! It's very addicting. However on my kindle, sometimes the screen starts to lag. Other than that it's a great app. And it's free. That's the best part!
B0063IH60K|4.0|enjoy solitaire. esp. winning!  very responsive and ads don't interrupt play.  good visuals. like deck faces. gotta get back to play.
0425263908|2.0|For those of you who read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" first don't even bother with this near, albeit less entertaining, duplication. Almost every part of Fifty Shades is evident throughout this book.  The rich businessman with an apparent painful past, the recent beautiful gradutate who lives with her roommate (this time it's a Bi-Sexual male instead of female), the incessant need for male domination, the fights and make-ups, the jealous yet beautiful female Ex-lover who threatens their future...etc. Sylvia Day said thank you to E.L. James in the acknowledgments and I would think for literally creating the outline of Sylvia's next novel, being Bared to You. The second reason I didn't care much for this rendition is that the main female character, Eva is obviously less intelligent than Ana and you will notice this in her limited vocabulary throughout the book not to mention her lack of judgement and nearly clingy dispostion.  I get that Ana used words that don't always flow out of the mouths of everyday people however it fit her being that her hobbies were classic novels and otherwise being an Editor. The C-Word, yes that word, is used more than once in this book.  The other C-word, \\"cock\\" describes the main male's, (Gideon) private parts throughout the book.  Together these words with the quickness in which they end up in the sack frankly made me feel dirty reading it.  The fact that Bared to You's main protagonist ends up getting the controlling male character to couples therapy by the end of book one was almost too much for me.<br /><br />If you are simply waiting for E.L. James to create the Christian Grey point of view book and are desparete then fine, borrow this from a friend.  I wish I never spend the $9.99 on it.  I will say though, Sylvia did end the book in a way that I almost feel tempted to continue with book two.  Yes, there will be a book two out in October.  I'm hoping that I've completely forgotten about it at that point otherwise, I'm just going to borrow it and keep in my car for the occational doctors' office waiting room.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Let's not confuse the issue here: this isn't \\"Ghandi\\" or \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" or \\"The Artist.\\" It's a hang on to your suspension of belief, big Hollywood, blockbusting, metal crushing, Alien butt kicking summer movie that isn't way over the top or goofy under-done. And, they found creative ways to work in the classic concepts of the Hasbro game that won't make you groan. It's a fun summer movie that fits every expectation of what that means.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was outstanding!!!!!  I hope that there will be more sequels to come, I truly enjoyed the story line.  I have started reading this book again, because it was really a very good read!  Keep up the excellent writing EJ James!  I'm looking forward to more of your books!
B00884GR0W|3.0|- The game freezes when I dig down.<br />- I go through the wall every time there's an earthquake.<br />- After I played it a couple of times, I tried to play it again, but the blocks didn't load and I was just floating in the middle of nowhere.<br />- I tried to uninstall it and then reinstall to fix that last problem, but when I went to the appstore to install it again, it said open instead of install and when I pressed it, nothing happened.<br /><br />  The game was fine while it worked and if it didn't have those last two problems, I would rate 5 stars. I played this on my Kindle Fire and the app only worked for two days. I think you should try Block Story Lite before buying this app because its not for everyone.
B006RUJST6|4.0|I didn't ***LOVE*** this book, but I liked it.<br /><br />The characters are very-well developed and likable.  The story itself is also believable.  I thought the \\"slam\\" part of the story was interesting.  I had never heard of \\"slamming\\" before.  I think it was a great device to propel the plot and it made the book different from others.  Another distinction I like about the book is that it deals with life situations that aren't typically talked about.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this is a YA novel, so it's a sweet, clean romance.  It's not a \\"50 Shades\\" type stuff.<br /><br />There were some things I didn't like about it:<br />* Editing could have been improved<br />* I didn't really like the stereotypical things Lake would say about Texas<br />* The Kindle edition is a hot mess! Some pages were half empty, so I would think it was the end of the chapter.  When I went to the next page, it was the middle of a completely different sentence.  It would correct itself if I went back a page then forward again. I had to constantly do that.  It was mildly annoying.<br />* There were some times I really wanted to punch Will in the face! haha
6304698623|5.0|Yes, I know they changed the ending from the book, making it more like the Shirley Temple version than the Masterpiece Theatre one, but this is still an excellent movie. As a child I loved the novels of Frances Hodgson Burnett and I certainly enjoyed the early movie versions of the novels--especially Margaret O'Brien's 1949 The Secret Garden which also starred a young Dean Stockwell as Colin and a british actor named Brian Roper who will ALWAYS be the best Dickon (in my opinion.) When this film version came out in 1995 I had an 11 and 8 year old and wanted them to feel the magic that these books (and movies) conveyed.<br /><br />And I think this film does an excellent job of conveying the magic--capturing the audience.  The scenes from India that are laced throughout the film add a beautiful exotic touch. The casting is also excellent. Vanessa Lee Chester as Becky has such an expressive face. The villianess is perfect. But this movie is carried by Liesel Matthews. It was YEARS after my first viewing of this movie that I saw it again and became interested in learning a little more about the actors.  Lo and behold--I discover that Ms. Matthews is, in fact, a REAL princess (one of the heirs of the  Hyatt Hotels founder I believe?) A cool piece of background trivia, but it doesn't change the fact that she nails the portrayal of this character--her deep sadness at her father's departure, her stoic response to her change in fortune, her ability to still find joy in the little things--the snow scene is particularly memorable--her twirling made me want to learn how to spin like that even though I know I'd puke before I made six rotations. I remember reading somewhere that the director said Ms. Matthews brought an inner life to the character and that because she wasn't so ambitious about her career she was ready to have fun with the role. All I know is that she makes an impression--and fifteen years later I enjoyed watching the movie all over again.

My 27 year old daughter doesn't \\"get them\\"', but<br />I don't \\"get\\" her music either. Cinderella has longevity, unlike so many<br />groups that just come and go.  Tom has an amazing voice, and<br />actually seems like a genuinely nice person who hasn't let his success<br />go to his head. In the past, I've met a couple famous lead singers, they were<br />arrogant and narcissistic.  Needless to say, their records were thrown in<br />the trash. Cinderella is a permanent download in my car.
B0012HF5NC|2.0|I saw \\"Independence Day\\" (here after ID) way back 16 years ago when it exploded onto theaters.  I haven't seen it since, on cable or TV or otherwise (and have no burning desire to do so again); therefore this brief (by my standards, anyway) review will be based on my memory of that \\"epochal\\" event.  As a synopsis, I would hazard to guess that my opinion of the movie is probably summed up by the majority of the 1-star and 2-star Amazon reviews of this movie.  Superficially, this alien invasion movie is exciting, loud, and suspenseful, as long as you keep your brain from participating.  However, once you start thinking about the cliches, inconsistencies, stereotypes, inexplicable coincidences, and blustering macho, xenophobic, Ameri-patriotism the 1- and 2-star posters have so colorfully and thoroughly illustrated, you realize ID is a flashy but useless piece of junk - like a Cadillac without an engine.<br /><br />  Of all the illogical concepts ID heaps upon us, I think the most irritating one is this:  Earth is invaded by astronomically large spaceships and pod fighters with unfathomably superior alien technology.  Later in the movie, the captured alien admits that purpose of their arrival was simply to decimate the Earth and its inhabitants.  THEN WHY DID'NT THE ALIENS DO JUST THAT AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVED, INSTEAD OF FUTZING AROUND AND DESTROYING A BUILDING HERE AND THERE (E.G.THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING  AND THE WHITE HOUSE) WHY?<br /><br />  Ultimately, ID is just senseless and stupid!

034580404X|4.0|Not the best written books I have ever read, but they were still good.  The cliff hanger from the first book to the second book was AMAZING.  I was 10 minutes late to work finishing the first and then only made it an hour into my shift before I was begging my husband to bring me the 2nd book from home.  The 2nd book was, by far, my favorite.  If you are not into crazy hot sex scenes then this book is not for you.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it does and tells me everything I need!!  and then some!!  cool interface lots of extras and I haven't even upgraded to pro yet
B00006CXSS|5.0|EXCELLENT portrayal of life in a platoon of airborne soldiers in the European Theater of this conflict. Gives one a picture of what these heroes went through, and gives one a new respect for our parents generation. Historically accurate, told by those who were there.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|loved the series. but the first book was the best catching fire got kinda boring with who does Katniss chose Gale or Peetah. also mockingjay had a slow start. but its a great series and definatly worth it.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This is an excellent portrayal of life in the Pacific Theater of World War Two. Accurate and historically based, and excellent movie to watch and enjoy.
0385342063|4.0|This is an excellent easy reading - as funny and delightful as early \\"Shopaholic\\" novels. The heroine is more mature (and therefore more likable) than Becky in Shopaholic, but otherwise it is the same character: kind and caring, impulsive and emotional, trusting and funny. Ok, she is as improbable as Becky, if you neeed to ask.<br /><br />It is not the kind of the book that you would read to know how it ends. Come on, you already know that it would be happy and cheesy! But the process of getting there is so much fun - you'd pick up this book to smile and laugh, and to marvel at the way protagonist gets out of all the messes she created to start with... Right in the first paragraph of the book she admits to lose her engagement ring - a week before the wedding! For sure, some of you would love to know whether the wedding is going to happen. And for those of you who thinks that the ring was stolen by a bunch of international terrorists - you picked up the wrong book. For the rest - grab the book and the towel and head to the beach!<br /><br />One caution: it is not the book to read on Kindle. It has a lot of footnotes , which are actually the part of the story and are supposed to be on the same page that you are reading. On Kindle, they're at the end of the chapter - and by the time you get there you've already missed all the humour of the original situation. For some reason, kindle's \\"back and forth\\" functionality didn't work on this edition.
B00000IREA|2.0|Great chance to see Jane Fonda make a real fool of herself .. she should have kept making this type of E grade movie instead of going to Viet Nam and making a complete fool of the entirety of America.

B0076UXKDG|2.0|If Nikon really wanted to make this battery holder worth $400, they should have had it also become a professional audio interface for the D800 by having line/mic switchable, balanced low impedance left and right XLR connectors.<br /><br />The D800 has marvelous audio capabilities, as far as it goes, what with its visible, easily controllable audio interface, including a headphone monitoring output. This is great.<br /><br />It would truly become a professional camera were it to receive XLR connectors for pro audio gear.<br /><br />BeachTek ([[ASIN:B003E3RK26 BeachTek DXA-SLR Dual XLR Audio Adapter with Built-in Preamplifiers and Phantom Power for DSLR Cameras with Mic Jack]]) should partner with a Chinese aftermarket grip maker like Meike or Pixel and build their audio electronics into the grip.<br /><br />They could still fit an extra EN-EL15 in the base (that could power the audio electronics if necessary) if they were clever and still have room for a couple of XLR jacks.<br /><br />The only trick would be to interface the circuitry back to the camera. Nikon would have to do this though its multi-pin connector. I'd give up all the buttons on the grip base to have pro audio interface.  After all, when using the D800 as a video camera, it's always in the horizontal position and the buttons in the grip are not needed.
B006YZOXHQ|3.0|What can I say...an excellent transfer. Color, contrast, detail, blacks...all excellent. BUT: it's a Paramount disc. And someone in that company who's responsible for all Paramount's Blu-ray discs, entertains the strange notion that a non-removable, retention-causing timeline that pops up when you touch 'pause' or 'forward' etc., heightens the joy of watching HD.<br />This guy probably does not own a regular Blu-ray player. If he did, he would've known that all players on the consumer's market offer the possibility of showing all kinds of disc info, including a timeline...but only if you WANT them to.<br />So Paramount's non-removable, retention-causing and utterly annoying timeline is also completely superfluous... So why do they do it? Anyone...?
B000000OY9|2.0|Neil Young in the late 70's and through most of the 80's was like Lou Reed; even if the album was awful, there was at least one amazing track that is among that artist's best work.<br /><br />Landing on Water is not really a great album, or even a good album.  I do not begrudge an artist, especially Neil, experimenting and doing something atypical.  I think one of the problems with this album was the production.  Some of the songs probably would be better regarded if done by another band and not done with such a new-wave production style.  I think if this album was done by Crazy Horse, or the Stray Gators, it would be a much better album.  But on the flip side, I don't think Neil has ever done any of these, or many of these songs in concert, since the initial tour to promote the album, so maybe he doesn't feel that they're a particularly strong bunch of songs.<br /><br />That being said, I think there are some great songs on this album, despite the production.  \\"Violent Side\\" and \\"Weight of the World\\" are great, though the stand out track is \\"Hippie Dream\\" and I think it one of Neil's best songs - ever.  And one I'd love to hear done by the Horse.  I think that could be an amazing version.  But, it is also one of the songs that fits the style of production.<br /><br />Basically, this album is for Neil completists, someone who likes a song or two from the album (which is why I originally bought the album - I wanted to hear \\"Hippie Dream.\\"  The song did receive a fair amount of airplay when the album came out.), or a really hardcore Neil nut.  Not the first Neil CD to pick up if you're new to Neil.  Or, heck, probably not on the of the first fifteen CD's to pick-up.  Though, that is an interesting mental picture, some fourteen year old music nut: \\"I want to check out Neil Young; I've heard great things about him.  I'll go on Amazon and buy the CD that is the lowest rating of all his CD's...\\"
0345803485|1.0|Okay, I admit that I liked the Twilight books...with the understanding that there was a hint of domestic violence on the fringe.  This book takes it over the top.  I read it ONLY because my book club decided to read/discuss it.  I have since read all three books.  Yes, writing is awful.  \\"I bite my lip\\"...\\"he tell's me not to bite my lip\\" and I applaude the Kindle reader who did a word search...geez how many times were entire paragraphs repeated??!! So as a nurse I wanted to discuss the domestic violence circle which is CLEARLY seen in this book...and NONE of the women in the group saw it!!!  They were all caught up in the sex scenes (and holy crap...who has sex 3x a day? Really?) and not the undertones.  Domestic circle of violence...he gets mad...he blames you...you are frightened...he threatens you physically or emotionally (he actually hurts the you or causes emotional distress bc of threats)...you apologize...he accepts the apology...honeymoon period where everything is fine...THEN IT STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN.  BTW...he/she...I recognize female violence on males happens...I simply choose the pronouns bc of the book.  This book says it is okay if your boyfriend is rich and hot to accept the violent undertones.  I worry about young women who read this book and don't see that violence (threats...anger...physical violence) are NOT OKAY in a relationship.  They will take from this book that they will be able to \\"cure\\" Christian (or their current boyfriend) with love.  This trilogy makes me sick to my stomach thinking about young girls/women who will rationalize their own dysfunctional relationships bc \\"Ana changed Christian\\".  Ladies...RUN from men who do not uplift you in a positive way!!!  I will never let my daughter read these books!!!  It would cause great damage to her self worth. 'Nuff said.
0765356147|1.0|Wow. This book was boring, boring, boring. Read the other reviews. Nothing happens for most of the book. And then, when you're trying to skim just to get the end of the story, he starts mixing up different types of magic and all the convoluted rules that go with each. So you have to slow down, and get involved with this stuff when you are just ready to stop the pain and get to the end to figure out what the mists are, what Vin is, what the Kandra are, etc, etc.<br />You do eventually find out, but boy it's a painful process getting there.<br /><br />Sanderson does great with one book stories. Elantris a good case in point. But it seemed like he could have fit the last two books into just one and saved a lot of trees and bytes in the process.<br /><br />Yuck

030758836X|1.0|Do not waste your money on this terrible, horrible, very bad novel.  The plot is totally implausible and the characters are detestable.  The only reason I finished the book was because I had spent the money to buy it.  I could have cared less what happened to any of the characters.  The ending was just plain stupid.  I guess the concept behind the plot was clever but just too creepy for words.  This is one author I will avoid at all costs in the future.

B007XNAQL0|5.0|My only wish now is that he remakes Growing Up Live on Blu Ray with HD audio.<br /><br />I you're a Gabriel fan this is must have. I have loved this live CD for years so to bring back the concert on Blu Ray is a welcome addition to the collection. A lot of production went into this show. Some great playing from the crew as usual. Interesting to see him 20 years ago. His voice is stellar and in his prime. The DTS-HD audio on this is the quality I've come to expect from Peter. Absolutely spot on. Love it. The video is a bit soft and grainy but that's to be expected from the transfer. No big deal really. A minor gripe. This is as good as it gets for a 2 decade old concert recording. Highly recommended.

B000Q67DEO|5.0|\\"Eat to the Beat\\" - At long last they put The Videotape onto DVD.<br />Why did they wait so long?<br />It was Ground-breaking in its day, pre-dating MTV, and VTRs were high-end luxury electronics (and only Beta machines.)<br />The Eventide Spectrum Analyzer as seen on \\"Shayla\\" still knocks me out.  To think that it ran on a PET!<br />30 years hence, frozen in time.
B000HL09SA|5.0|I love pet movies, especially dogs.  Since I reside with a Jack Russell, this one was a particular joy.  It was a wonderful, loving, tear-jerker of a movie and reminded me of all the dogs I've had the honor to share a life with.

B007Z9RAX4|4.0|*Spoilers*<br /><br />I have to agree with other viewers about Gina--she makes the fight scenes more realistic, but she's also pretty good as a foil to her male counterparts.<br /><br />Also, the sound is way too dynamic (and/or hollow) on the bass end and covers up the dialogue which is too soft.<br /><br />If you use your mind as an editing machine, you can remove all the flashbacks and run the film straight through and find the weak point.  We never hear the conversation with Kenneth that gets her to the diner where she instead meets Aaron.  All the other flashbacks fill in the motivation for the actions--especially the plot points that Kenneth reveals (in flashbacks) at the end of the movie (same like Soderbergh's Contagion where we cycle through the events that come to Patient Zero at the end of the film).  Yet, even if we would straighten out the film so that it ran with no flashbacks, it still has a problem.<br /><br />Earlier, we hear Kenneth try to talk to Gina after she finishes off Paul, but no conversation.  Subsequently, a meeting with Kenneth somehow gets set up--with no conversation in flashback or anything.  Filling in that conversation would not solve the film's problem, though.<br /><br />After you watch the film all the way through you find out that Kenneth thinks Gina is going to steal his clients and go off on her own.<br /><br />Here's the weakness in the film:  Kenneth never confronts Gina about either their relationship that ended or the business relationship that he believes will end.  In fact, because their relationship isn't developed (where the flashbacks really belong), I have a hard time believing that either one had anything at stake.  The spine of the movie should have been Gina and Kenneth's love and biz relationship because that would have made the betrayal much stronger (and more mysterious for Gina).  You could even have a flashback for her dad warning her about Kenneth because she says he evidently did.<br /><br />All the rigmarole with those other dudes is a distraction.  Kenneth betrays Gina because he suspects Gina will betray him, but that's never really developed.le with those other dudes is a distraction.  Kenneth betrays Gina because he suspects Gina will betray him, but that's never really developed.

B001RIY4WE|5.0|Arnold is back, this time as a friendly cyborg against a living metal adversary in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. What's new about the Skynet Edition is the film is expanded, and the interactivity (including Blu-Ray Live) is about as extreme as it gets regarding T2. I did not have a 2.0 compliant player that connects to the Internet, so I cannot comment about the live content, which tends to be dynamic and therefore could/might change if I were to comment about it anyway.<br /><br />The total runtime of the extra content is not 30 or even 20 minutes if I recall, but it does make parts of the film make more sense or at least a bit better laugh, like when the T1000 is asked, \\"Are we learning yet?\\" These clips, put back in, perhaps add a little more gratuitous gore and cyberbabble to the story, which is likely why they were cut out of the theatrical version, which you can opt to view as well.<br /><br />As with well-made Blu-Ray movies, the image is sharp as a tack, the sound of explosions and other sounds are very real and visceral, and really put you into it. It makes me wish for a surround speaker system!<br /><br />This is a classic, both of Schwarzenegger's action films, and of the cyborg menace sci-fi flicks that came before and after. It had some cutting-edge effects for its time, and some still are seldom used or seen today. It's one of those amazing films that comes cheaply, easy to add to your library and keep to remember when sci-fi was a mix of effects, mind games, and terror. It's a pretty wild ride.

1401937519|5.0|Having become disillusioned with organized religion but still being an avid searcher with much 'existential angst,' when Anita's near death experience first appeared on NDERF a few years ago, it was like a breath of fresh air. In addition to closely following and participating on the many forum discussions at the time, I became acquainted with Anita through correspondence and personal conversations, and have since then considered her a very close friend.<br /><br />Even though I was familiar with much of the background information on Anita's NDE, I feel that she did a remarkable job in the book of highlighting the many diverse cultural and personal experiences that set the stage for her remarkable NDE. The book therefore, flows with easy reading and doesn't leave the reader bogged down in superfluous details, but integrates these earlier experiences in a way that adds insight to the message of her NDE.<br /><br />Anita's experience is therefore refreshing because it goes directly to the heart of 'message' without getting bogged down in hard to comprehend phantasmagoria typical of many NDEs. This is not to put down or argue against the validity of such other experiences, but though they may have great personal impact on the experiencer, they often leave others scratching their heads. Additionally, considering myself as a bit of an open minded skeptic, the circumstances involving Anita's healing and veridical experiences, added needed personal conviction.<br /><br />Anita is the real deal, and she has been greatly helpful to me as a friend in gaining perspective with some personal struggles along the way that I have encountered.  Her book and story offer a very refreshing and simple message in an otherwise overly complex world where hope seems scarce at times. Though it does not necessarily offer answers to the question of life after death, her experience portrays a transcendent dimension (or state) of self acceptance, clarity, and perspective for which we are largelyunaware in our world of confusion and suffering.<br /><br />I can only hope that messages like Anita's will continue to find 'wings' in this world of increasing religious, political and ideological dogma. And I think that if the whole world could have her experience, we would be largely tasting heaven on earth!

I wanted the originals from The Strand, and in particular the treasured Sidney Paget illustrations.  Well, this is it.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The 3rd book of the Hunger Games is much darker than the first two.  The uplifting spirit of hope that permeated the first book is almost non existant in this book.  Gale, one of my favorite characters from the first two books is virtually crushed and disposed of in the third book.  I realize the author had no intention of writing a feel good romance, and I'm glad for this, but I am disappointed in this third and final book.  Ttill an interesting and engaging read, but not the page turner that the first two are.

B004SIP8W0|5.0|588 reviews with five stars? This really tells you something! This movie would warm the heart of even the most stony-hearted. Set in WWII, this movie tells the (fictional) story of Guido, a Jewish-Italian with a huge heart and a quirky spirit. He courts a lovely lady named Dora and marries her. Their lives are turned up-end when the Nazis deport both Guido and his son Joshua to a concentration camp. Dora insists on coming with, and her wish is granted. Guido keeps joshua's spirit up through the whole film by keeping him in the (false) belief that this is just a huge game. In the end... Well, I can't say, so just watch it! For the whole effect, watch it in italian with English subtitles...
B004FRX0MY|3.0|I have been a long time user of the amazonmp3 app. It works very well for my needs. I can quickly access cloud content, purchase music, download it to my phone, play from the cloud, etc.<br /><br />I need to be able to specify a different download directory. The app won't allow me to. When I attempt to move the content from one location to another the playlist duplicates every individual track. One references the old location (where the file no longer exists) and the other references the new location (where the file currently exists and can be played normally.) I contacted support and they were unable to resolve this problem for me. Their best suggestion was to manually go through and delete out the old tracks, one by one. For anyone with more than just a couple of mp3s downloaded to their device, this process can be very tedious, cumbersome and time consuming.<br /><br />The player works well enough. The music store limits the number of results returned on searches and in category views. This can prevent me from browsing music the way I would like. I would like to see this limit removed, and instead add pagination to allow me to browse more content.<br /><br />This could easily be a 5 star app, but these issues are glaring oversights that impact the overall experience.

0812993292|5.0|I selected \\"The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry\\" to read and review because I loved \\"Major Pettigrew's Last Stand,\\" a book to which it was compared in the publisher's preview.  And while I prefer \\"Major Pettigrew\\" for its pacing and multicultural appeal, I wholeheartedly recommend \\"Harold Fry.\\"  It has charms of its own.<br /><br />Henry David Thoreau observed, \\"The mass of men live lives of quiet desperation,\\" and I could not help but recall this quotation as I began Rachel Joyce's lovely debut novel.  As the novel begins, Harold is merely existing.  The reader is not given many details, but it is clear that Harold's marriage to Maureen is an empty shell, and that there are problems in his relationship with his adult son, David.  Then Harold gets a farewell letter of sorts from a friend, Queenie Hennessy,  and his carefully orchestrated charade of a life begins to come apart.  Queenie had \\"done something nice\\" for Harold twenty years previous, and he always regretted not thanking her.  Whatever this is is shrouded in mystery, and many readers will suspect a long-past affair.  All these questions are a bit disconcerting, but if the reader is patient, all will be resolved.<br /><br />Harold writes a \\"pro forma\\" response to Queenie's note, but as he goes out to mail it, something prevents him from putting it in the first mailbox he comes to.  He passes postbox after postbox, and eventually makes an impulsive decision to walk from his hometown to Queenie's hospice, about 600 miles.  Thus begins his transformation from a kind of living death to fullness of life.<br /><br />Readers who are familiar with Joseph Campbell's \\"The Hero's Journey\\" will immediately recognize the motif:  the hero leaves the world he knows to embark on a quest.  Along the way he meets both helpers and tempters, and he eventually returns to the known world with a fullness of knowledge or with something to enrich his community and himself.<br /><br />Harold Fry fits this motif to a tee.  He meetsmany people and even animals along the way, and he gains something of value from each of them, even those who would deter him from his quest.  Meanwhile, back at home, Maureen is undergoing her own transformation as she worries and responds to Harold's calls, postcards, and gifts.  Nothing is as Harold or Maureen expect it to be.  And the end of the quest is rewarding, but not in the way Harold imagines.<br /><br />One final observation:  This is a beautifully written novel.  Most readers will love the use of language, especially in descriptions of the natural world.  I am stunned that this is the author's first novel, though she has written many screenplays for the BBC.  I hope to read much more of her work.<br /><br />Most readers will like and appreciate \\"Harold Fry\\" if they persevere through the ambiguity at the beginning.  Everything falls together eventually, I promise!  Highly recommended.

B000NK6T9S|5.0|I bought this book for a friend of mine who was too stupid to realize how & what he would say to his wife was the cause of their discord in their marriage.  She is also reading the book to better understand how both of their stupidities were undermining their ability to communicate.<br />When either one of them forgets the rules of communication then I simply hit them over their heads with the book and say read it again...not really but I do tell them to grow up and remember how neither one of them is \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" but they just have two different views and ways of understanding each other.
0099519852|5.0|For anyone wanting to understand what it takes to improve performance in any field of endeavor this is the book to read. Dance, golf, playing an instrument, tennis, singing, soccer, you name it. I'm a singer and this is probably the most exciting book I've read in the last several years relative to understanding the growth of my talent and helping others to improve. Not only a 'how to' book but a science based explanation of what happens to our brains. It may not sound exciting but it was an eye opener for me. It's increasing the wrapping of myelin around the particular nerve pathways in the central nervous system essential to your particular skill set. I've already purchased two copies and given them away and I'll buy a few more. Give it a try.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book... and because they did such a fantastic job following the book in the first movie... I'm thrilled about seeing the second movie!  Books like this inspire us to read... and read... and read... and read... even my 11 yr old has finished the series with a sense of \\"What am I going to read now?\\"  Love it!
B0059XTUXQ|5.0|This movie does an excellent  job of portraying Margaret Thatcher  from start to finish...both in good times and bad.  It also demonstrates what we all must eventually experience, our senior years.  Most movies end the story while the character is in his or her prime.  We never experience what happens to the person once old age sets in and realities change.  This movie covers that period very well, and I hope more storytellers will follow this movies lead and not be afraid  to show what happens to all of us eventually when we retreat to our memories.  Loved the movie, loved the delivery, and will watch it over and over again.  5 STARS.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Want a real page turner for the beach? Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn is the book for you<br /><br />Gone Girl is Narrated by Nick Dunne and his wife, Amy, in alternate chapters. The story begins when Nick and Amy lose their jobs and move from New York City to Nick's hometown of North Carthage, Mo. and into a McMansion. No one is happy--especially Amy. When Amy disappears, Nick is the obvious suspect.<br /><br />In the beginning Amy seems almost perfect but then cracks begin to appear same with Nick.<br /><br />If you're reading a book you can't put down, Kindles are great you can tuck them in your purse and be on your way.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|The description for Star Wars: The Original Trilogy is unclear as to what is on the disks.  Are you getting the original movies as we seen them in the theater or will you find the more recent altered versions.  I would be happy to pay for the original trilogy with the scenes and characters as originially released.  Why has finding the real versions of these films become so difficult?<br /><br />Please be specific as to the version in the box...they are not interchangeable...one version is classic and the other poorly considered.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the first workout video I've used to aid in my weight loss. I'm about 75lbs overweight (I had already lost 27 pounds previous to starting the shred with walking and calorie counting) I did commit to the full 30 days, which was probably harder than some of the exercises. I lost a total of 6 pounds & lost 11.75\\" total body...not bad for a 24 minute workout. I have actual muscle definition & notice it the most in my chest/arms/core area. My friend did this along with me (who just had a baby in May) she lost 10.75 lbs and over 11\\" total body!!<br />This DVD is worth the $ and it will definitely help you if you plan to do any other Jillian DVDs which seem to be either longer or harder, but I'm up for the challenge. Finishing strong as Jillian says. =)

1594744769|5.0|It's such a beautiful and magical story!! It reminds me a lot of another one of my favorite books, [[ASIN:0553384031 The Orphan's Tales: In the Night Garden]] by Catherynne M. Valente. Riggs shares a certain amount of her style - with his use of lush vocabulary and use of magic. Though technically this book falls under the Young Adult genre, its elevated vocabulary may intimidate younger readers in the genre - or maybe inspire them to expand their own knowledge, but there is nothing inappropriate for readers in these pages. It's simple a wonderful story with great imagery - both actual and metaphorical. Though the photographs do add significantly to the story, they are so well described in the text, they feel familiar before you even view them! And with an ending like that - I am crossing my fingers that the wait for the sequel won't be too terribly long!!
0345529057|5.0|Like most people, I watched the HBO series on cable TV and was blown away by the witty dialogue and gritty plots and subplots. The onscreen intrigue is what led me to the actual books over here.<br /><br />There are already many well written reviews about this fantasy series. So I'll keep this review very short (and hopefully sweet).<br /><br />Why should you buy this?<br /><br />1. Excellent (and gripping) storyline with realistic characters<br />2. Value for $$ - Buying this set is much cheaper than purchasing the books individually.<br /><br />For those detractors who posted many -ve comments about missing pages and other product defects, I confirm that there are no such missing pages from my set which was purchased from Amazon (not sub-merchants) in July 2012. Yes, I checked all 4 of my books from cover to cover.<br /><br />I wrote this review primarily to provide reassurance as a fellow consumer about the missing pages debacle. I believe that the publisher has since remedied the missing pages issue.<br /><br />So I hope that you find this review useful! :)
0307716511|2.0|Initially, I really enjoyed this book. It opens up and immediately grasps readers with its unique perspective - the book is narrated by one sister directly to her deceased sister, catching her up on what has been happening since her death. It really gives an interesting frame to the novel and its actions. There is a lot of emotion in this book - and Lupton does a wonderful job of conveying a realistic relationship between these two sisters.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the ending spoiled the entire book for me. It is one of those manipulative endings with a surprise so shocking that it completely detracts from the entire build-up of the book. The final conflict and resolution are rendered pointless. Despite the manipulative end twist, other parts in the plot felt predictable, which slowed the action down quite a bit in sections. Lupton introduces a lot of interesting information about cystic fibrosis here which adds a lot to the overall storyline, but her betrayal to the reader just soured the book past the redeeming point for me. I don't like books that seem to revel in tricking the reader, and it just felt especially disappointing have such a promising beginning (and middle) of the book.

B000088E6D|5.0|This is one of my favorite CDs.  Buble has a beautiful voice, and can actually sing (which I can not say for many current artists).  I love the way he plays with some of my favorite songs: Fever, Sway, Moondance.  He keeps the substance that makes the songs great on their own, but he gives them his own flavor.
B0077SGMXM|4.0|Addictive and fun,but it feels like you need several special balls for each course to force players in to buying power ups.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn's \\"Gone Girl\\" is the tale of a marriage that starts out nearly perfect, but disintegrates into a nightmarish and manipulative mess when Amy Dunne goes missing on the morning of her fifth wedding anniversary.  In most cases such as this, the police first suspect the husband of foul play and Nick Dunne, Amy's husband, makes some mistakes that only seem to confirm their suspicions.<br /><br />That is just Part One of this thriller that kept me reading and also made me just a little crazy making up my own mind about who did what, only to change it again after another five pages or so.  This novel is a page-turner, an edge-of-your-seat look at two people who thought they knew each other when they got married, and a book that has enough twists that the reader never knows what's around the next bend.<br /><br />The story is told by Nick and Amy, with Nick speaking in the first person and we learn about Amy through her diary.  The couple started out happily married until each realized they didn't really know who the other one really was. Lies and deceit made them into the people they each thought they knew.<br /><br />The plot and the characters in \\"Gone Girl\\" are very complicated and convoluted, which makes the reader's chance of figuring it all not easy. Just the psychology of it is enough to give one the creeps.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I'm looking forward to reading more by the author. This is one of the best thrillers I've read this year and the first of Gillian Flynn's books I've read.  Her first book is downloaded already on my Kindle and ready to read.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|You can relive the movie every time you hear this soundtrack.  My favorite is Alex and Russell singing together.  Tom Cruise has an excellent voice and is a great Stacy Jaxx.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|After all the hyppe I decided to read this book and I immediately thought that I'd certainly made a mistake by bothering to purchase it. Initially I found it not easy for me to get into and at one point I thought the author was very confused having Ana as a 22 year old, because with all those flushes (about 3 for every page), I thought she must be a 50 something menopausal woman!!! No but seriously, the story line of innocent virgin even fleetingly considering to become invoved with a guy who is a dominant, wants an NDC signed and a contract that will totally control every aspect of her life, to be very unbelieveable and something I just could never relate to. I think the writer tries way too hard for the story to be hot and tantalizing. Having said all that I did find myself getting to the end wanting to find out what happens with Christian and Ana, so I did buy the next book in the series, so I suppose the author was quite clever after all. Would I recommend it? Not sure yet, let me get back to you.
B0089LT8HI|4.0|Warning for vinyl lovers!  The album is really really good.  The artwork and packaging is also excellent.  Unfortunately, the vinyl is thin and flimsy.  My copy is severely warped.  The tone arm goes up and down constantly with a good 1/3\\"-1/2\\" vertical movement.  I got so annoyed that I got out my kitchen scale to weigh the vinyl.  128 grams.  This is unacceptable for an album that costs over $25.  You might want to consider just getting the CD or buying the MP3s.  I wish I had.

B0083F5J7S|2.0|Maroon 5 was a new product when they hit the scene. I am talking \\"This Love\\",etc.  Then they created this \\"Songs About Jane\\" concept that their writings are love songs. But more Love-Hate songs. With each following album, a hit single was needed, but to keep up with pop's vulgar side, the best songs seem to be labeled \\"Explicit\\" and many times a download comes bleeped. There has been no evolution, but definitely a de-evolution. With the street price of a digital download a buck a pop, music is a disposable product, with a shelf life of a month if that.  I admit I am of a past generation. My teen years were the 70's and my 20's were spent in the 80's. I never understood the violence and hatred associated with Rap. I do know that the target demographics for music these days are pre-teens to high school, with cute cell phones with the latest commercials loaded onto them with very little exposure to allow them to develop a diversified taste in music. But check out music from the 70's and 80's on Youtube and you will find comments of teenagers stating how great music was back then compared to the crap we have to listen to now.<br />There are exceptions, Pink and Katy Perry to name a few.  As far as I can tell, this band has recycled it's material and rebranded it to the point that it can be labeled recycled.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Out of curiosity, I purchased this book on my Kindle as I waited for a flight. While I am not into erotica, I was drawn by the hype. Firstly, this is very bad writing--who really says things like \\"holy crap\\"? It is stilted and lacking on all fronts. But, I suppose people who like this kind of stuff don't really care about literary quality.<br />Secondly, what offended me most was the portrayal of women as willingly submissive to a creepy male! Please--I thought being titillated by such crap was not a good thing.<br />Lastly, in the end I returned my purchase as I do not want to add to the growing numbers who subscribe to poor writing and contribute to ways to devalue women.
B006RUJST6|1.0|I felt it necessary to review this book if only because of all the&#34;awesome&#34; reviews.  Absolutely totally unreadable.

034580404X|5.0|I have to say that I agree 100% with the review written by Sierra Sorrell.  The bondage events, as exciting as they were, was not the meaning of this amazing trilogy.  It was a means to an end, a way to help the reader get to now the two main characters in the story.  I was so involved reading this trilogy, I actually rushed home to get back to my reading each evening.  The price factor, these books sold individually and as a set are reasonably priced. Those who felt this was not a romance really are lost without a clue.<br /><br />To conclude my tirade, this is an amazing work of art, and I look forward to the movie whenever it comes out.  If you are in the mood for a hot, steamy, sexy, romantic, humorous, thrilling and adventurous read please do not hesitate to pick up this trilogy, it is so worth it.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next novel!!!!!!

B007IXWL2C|4.0|I fell to the \\"housewife porn\\" as many of my friends have.  Yes their are errors, but really, I was so into the story I didn't focus on them as much as many have.  Of course this is fantasy because of how fast this relationship took place.  The author uses many terms repetitively and keeps saying over and over how gorgeous Christian Grey is.  This was not bothersome to me.  This trilogy was the first time in a very long time, that I have been able to really immerse myself in a story.  I love it.  I like how the third book goes into the future and tells you more of their life and their love for one another.  After reading the last book, I was left feeling empty.  Empty because I was so involved in the characters and their story.  That is what every author wants when they write a book.  Well E. L. James....You did it perfectly.  It wasn't even about the sex.  The dynamic between Ana and Christian was remarkable.  Their relationship reminded me of mine with my husband.  The emails between them were electrifying.  Their constant banter was playful and I loved every minute of it.  My husband and I mirror that relationship.  (Not the sexually part so much...lol..meaning the whips and canes..and of course not the billions of dollars)  I liked how they would say things between them and only they knew what it meant.  My husband and I do the same.  I just really liked the love story between them.  They NEEDED one another.  It was like they were meant to be!  A DEFINITE MUST READ!!

B00884GR0W|4.0|I really like this app, but the days are too short. I'll come out of my house, harvest a tree, and the sun's setting. also, it's difficult to place blocks sometimes. its kind of hard to fight the creatures, too. and, I wish you had a map and you could pinpoint places like your house and your favorite cave on it, so you dont get lost so much. that's pretty much all I've found that I don't like. great job, mind blocks! cant wait to see what the next update has in store!<br />I would highly recommend this app.
B000002JKA|5.0|I&W is an absolute masterpiece and it's still my favorite Dream Theater album but Awake is an amazing follow up to it and they take a new direction. It's overall darker and heavier than I&W, production's also better (especially the drums). It's isn't too overproduced either and it sounds great for the mid '90s. 6:00 is a great opening track and it's a faster hard rock track. It already shows a change from I&W and it's one of the best songs from Awake. Caught In A Web is almost as good as 6:00, another great hard rocker. Don't worry about diversity just because the first 2 songs are heavier tracks, the next track Innocence Faded shows a more melodic side followed by an instrumental track \\"Erotomania\\". It also has a couple ballads including Lifting Shadows Off A Dream, Space-Dye Vest and The Silent Man. It's included in the 3 part song, starting from the 9 minute track \\"Voices\\" than \\"The Silent Man\\" comes and then after a ballad it goes straight to the heaviest track on the CD \\"The Mirror\\" which is also my favorite from Awake. Awake is an absolute classic and one of the best albums in progressive metal, every track is great and the album never gets boring while listening to it. Still holds up very well with age.

B00782O7IY|4.0|I suppose it isn't surprising that \\"The Artist\\" won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, as it is a tribute to Hollywood filmmaking -by a Frenchman, no less. But this is a fun film and a reminder that it doesn't take much to make an old art form and approach new again. Silent film was eclipsed by sound at its height in the late 1920s. It went from apogee to non-existence in just a few years. French director Michel Hazanavicius saw the drama in that. He loves silent film. So he chose to dramatize the great change in Hollywood with an homage, a silent film about the misfortunes of a silent film actor and the rising star of an actress who finds success in the \\"talkies\\".<br /><br />In 1927, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a big star of the silent screen. He typically appears as a dashing adventurer with his beloved Jack Russell Terrier (Uggie) as a comic sidekick. Audiences line the streets to see his films, and George clearly enjoys the stardom. He bumps into a fan one evening at a premiere. George makes light of the incident, and they both mug for the cameras. Encouraged by the publicity, Peppy Miller (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo) goes to Kinograph Studios the next day to audition as a dancing extra, where she runs into George again. They get along famously but see little of one another as George faces financial ruin when talkies come into fashion, and Peppy turns out to be just the vivacious young woman that audiences want to see -and hear- onscreen.<br /><br />Since this is silent film, it doesn't matter that half the cast is French and half American. This is ironic, as George's voice disqualified him from making the transition to talkies. Clever interplay between the modern silent film we are watching and the historical world of silent films within that film are a big part of its appeal. This gives the audience something to think about beyond the simple melodrama onscreen. \\"The Artist\\" isn't only nostalgia, though there is plenty of that. It's a comment as well as a tribute to the silent era. It's about a dying art form and the art that emerges to take its place, made as Hollywood wrings its hands and wonders if 3-D will save it from rising production costs and lost DVD sales.<br /><br />There are intertitles, but \\"The Artist\\" tells the story with images, as films did before sound. The shot was the component part rather than the scene. This is difficult for a modern cinematographer to achieve. The shots are not as striking as the greatest silent films, but an effort to compose the scenes so as to tell as story visually is apparent. Cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman does admirable work. I only wish that more modern films made such an effort to be visually smart. The energy of the lead actors engages the audience, while the terrier runs around and amuses us, and \\"The Artist\\" looks great. If the demise of silent film and transition to talkies interests you, Scott Eyman's \\"The Speed of Sound\\" is a good book on the subject.tribute to the silent era.

1416583432|3.0|This book can be a delight or a disappointment, depending on what the reader's expectations are prior to reading it. As a dog owner who loves my pet, I approached this book expecting that the author would explain all the strange, weird and wonderful behavior of my four-legged best friend. But as author Alexandra Horowitz points out, dogs are as individual as people are, and while we are capable of concluding sweeping generalities (such as how a dog's primary sense isn't sight, but smell), much depends on a dog's breed, life experience and environment to explain a lot of canine behavior. Still, the author paints a picture of what a dog's eye view of the world looks like and instills in the reader a consciousness about what it must be like to be a dog: seeing the world from a lower vantage point, being led by one's nose. The author is a skilled observer of doggy-style behavior, with good insight into their play, their interaction with other dogs and of their cognitive functioning. She explains how a dog sees the world, not in black and white as a popular misconception states, but through a different spectrum than humans. The reader will not come away with a complete understanding of why their dogs act the way they do, but he or she will learn things about dogs that he or she didn't know before.<br /><br />The delight in this book comes from how the author's love of her subject is so apparent. She writes with a light-hearted passion for her subject matter. She gives some amusing yet practical advice about how to name one's dog, and makes a compelling argument in praise of mutts over purebreds. The last chapter about the author's relationship with her own dog (named Pumpernickel, or Pump for short) is especially touching and will probably cause most dog lovers to shed a tear. The author's love of her subjects comes through powerfully in this book.<br /><br />The reader's enjoyment of this book will be affected by the reader's expectations. Those hoping that the book contains the hidden key to understanding their own pet will likely experience disappointment. But those looking for an enjoyable read about our canine companions, with a scientific bent but without all the answers about why their dog acts like it does, will be very satisfied.tains the hidden key to understanding their own pet will likely experience disappointment.

B00843TZJM|3.0|Aggreed, who puts out a Blu - Ray in DTS-HD 2.0?  As for the old 3 part harmomies that sent goose bumps up my spine?  I hate to say it their swan song is 4 - 5+ years too late.  But I do have to say I was impressed that the concert was recorded 4/22/12 and it just hit the street!  As for Stills, he has lost a ton of weight but I would have liked to have seen him play a lot more of his vast array of Martin's.  I grew up on these guys and they will always be a part of who I am.  At the end of the show it looked like they had fun and somewhat suprised that they pulled it off... just not quite...
B006NYDV7Q|5.0|Well o.k., if you're a Weather Report fan and have all or most of these albums, maybe you don't need this.<br />If however, you're a fan like me, who had all of the albums on vinyl, and was lazy about picking up the cd's<br />or, if you are new to Weather Report (and if you are, BOY are you in for a treat!) you should have this set. Here's why.<br />First of all, an answer to the big question. 8:30 is complete. It's on one disc, but all 13 tracks are there, including<br />SCARLET WOMAN, and packaged in the original double sleeve.<br />Also, there are 12 bonus live tracks spread over four of the six albums. No extra tracks on 8:30, but having SCARLET WOMAN back<br />is bonus enough, and no extra tracks on the last album, WEATHER REPORT. Nine of the extra tracks are from the set LIVE AND UNRELEASED (all of the tracks with Jaco on that set are here) and three are from the Havana Jam concerts, two of which have never been released before. The tracks on each disc compliment the album they are on.<br />Sound quality is excellent as far as I am concerned. If you want to hunt down import copies that may sound better, or hold out for something<br />that may never come, be my guest. This is a great set, and well worth the money. Great tunes, great Jaco, and a last taste of Alphonso Johnson.

0062073478|4.0|And Then There Were None, Agatha Christie<br /><br />A number of people are invited or paid to spend time on Indian Island off the Devon coast. Chapter 1 introduces them and their past, we learn more in Chapter 2. The guests enjoyed a good meal that night (Chapter 3). Then an unseen voice accused each of them of murder! Judge Wargrave begins an inquiry. One of the group is a private detective hired to watch the others! The guests tell of their past (Chapter 4). They cannot leave until next morning. One man finishes his drink then collapsed on the floor. It was cyanide (Chapter 5)! The cook and housekeeper died in the night (Chapter 6). Three of the men decided to search the island (Chapter 7). No one was found (Chapter 8). Then another guest is found dead; it wasn't an accident (Chapter 9). The judge offers his solution. [Is there a subtle clue in this chapter?]<br /><br />Vera and Philip discuss the suspects (Chapter 10). [Do they have an affinity?] The butler did not wake them for breakfast (Chapter 11). They learn why. The elderly spinster did not join the others (Chapter 12). Philips's revolver is missing! Vera gets a shock when she goes to her room (Chapter 13). The rest of them learn why the judge stayed behind. The remaining four go to their bedrooms and lock their doors (Chapter 14). The detective sees a man leaving the house; they trail him and find he had disappeared! The three remaining try to signal the mainland but fail (Chapter 15). Another man is killed by a falling block of marble. The last two see a body at the water's edge; that missing man was found! Chapter 16 tells how another man died. The last survivor enters a bedroom to find a noose ready!<br /><br />The `Epilogue' summarizes this incredible problem. Ten people dead on an island without anyone to blame. The man who bought the island and provisioned it is also dead! Scotland Yard is baffled by the deaths. Who killed them?

B007MDQW3W|5.0|I love Regina Spektor because she is unique musically, which means she has her own very distinctive style.  Some negative reviewers make fun of her quirks.  Well, this fan wouldn't be interested without the quirks.  That is half the fun, yes I said FUN, of listening to Regina sing in her own unconventional way.  I think this album is solid and there really isn't a bad song in the whole set.  One of the best of the year and if that gets you to BUY this, then I did my part to spread the word about Regina.  It's unfortunate that her songs won't be popular hits, but that just means we are the lucky ones who have discovered her.  I have so many favorite tracks, but \\"Ballad of a Politician\\" \\"Oh Marcello\\" and \\"Open\\" are just so amazingly original, they stand out for me.  I would love to see Regina hook up with Elvis Costello for an uncommon duo.  Easily worth five stars.

B0081J95TE|3.0|The first new full-length Garbage album in the better part of a decade, Not Your Kind of People finds the band still capable of crafting a collection of tracks that boast that undeniable high quality production, crunchy and vibrant guitars and percussion, and alternately visceral, poignant, sexy, and disturbing lyrics.<br /><br />But something is definitely missing this time around.  There are really no standout tracks here; on virtually each one you can pick out bits and pieces that will have you nodding your head and pumping your fist (almost always during the chorus, I've found - probably because it's the only time the gang have restricted themselves to pounding out those loud, fast, punishing Garbage rhythms and Shirley is singing the way we all know she is capable of), but at the end of each listen you'll be left trying to remember what you just experienced.<br /><br />And this record is, unfortunately, bland enough to make that a much more frustrating exercise than any record before it. Good enough for Garbage fans, but this is not the best effort we've seen from them.  Maybe 7 years between albums is just a bit too much rust for a band to shake off in one release.

I have both Grado 325i and RS2 headphones and I am very pleased with the sound the e17 delivers for both. I use both my iPad or iPod when on the go and I actually prefer it to the sound I get with my e9. Of course the if I dock the e17 on the e9 the sound is great. I recommend purchasesing the fiio L10 line out dock...the sound is very flat and allows one to use the true bass and treble levels on the e17.

0701168889|1.0|Do not buy the American version of this book because nothing you make will turn out. I've used plenty of British recipes before, having lived in the UK for some years and also having inherited recipes from my English grandmother and her sister. I'm familiar with the differences in ingredients and have had no problems with other cookbooks. Maybe the British version is better, or else how would she get such positive reviews for Norwegian Mountain Bread that tastes like rock salt (I tried making it twice and triple-checked the recipe the second time), bread that deflates into a puddle, or oatcake dough that is basically unworkable and tasteless?<br /><br />I bake all the time, and I know sometimes recipes require a bit of adjustment - longer baking time, a little more flour, etc. This is not the case with this book. It has resulted in one culinary disaster after another, wasting my time, energy, and money, not to mention causing disappointment after anticipating a delicious treat that turned out awful.<br /><br />Spare yourself the experience. Do not buy this book.

0345803493|4.0|At the beginning of this book it's been five days since Ana and Christian broke up and they're both miserable.  Knowing that they can't live without each other leads them down a new path where Christian puts aside the lifestyle he's always engaged in with women before because he can't see his life without Ana.  From there we have a bunch of sexual interludes amongst moments where they actually talk to each other and we get a bigger glimpse into Christian's psyche.  Throw in a few individuals from their pasts who are out to do the new couple harm and you have a story that kept my attention but still leaves me confused as to its immense popularity.<br /><br />The strongest part of this story is Christian who's multi-faceted with a darkness that you can't help but want to cure.  Intermixed with that darkness is a charming boyishness that's sexy, along with moments of being overbearing.  You can't help but like him and he truly gives everything to make Ana happy.  Unfortunately, Ana isn't as multi-faceted.  She still seems to be a bit childish with a tendency to pout and doesn't seem as willing to sacrifice as Christian to make their relationship work.  The sexual encounters between these two are numerous and occupy a huge chunk of the story.  It's basically the best way for Christian to communicate his real feelings and these moments do show a change to their relationship.  There's a stronger sense of connection within these interludes.<br /><br />There's a slew of secondary characters that we really don't get to know much about beyond the superficial.  One especially appears to be a problem for the happy couple and he's already left an impact that's just beginning in this story.  As a villain he feels a bit over the top, but then everything about this story is over the top.<br /><br />I found this an entertaining read even though I have a love/hate relationship with this series.  I can appreciate how excited readers are about this series even if I find it a bit too melodramatic at times.  I still find myself drawn to Christian against my will and look forward to his finding peace and happiness.  I just wish he'd find someone stronger-willed/mature than Ana.<br /><br />3.5 Starslodramatic at times.

Use your own judgement on the news content provided: That's a personal preference. It's up to you to decide whether it's too liberal or too conservative for you.<br /><br />----<br /><br />I've been searching for a good news app for my Kindle Fire for quite a while.  I was looking for something as good as or better than The Daily app that my wife has on her iPad. I found this BBC News app a few days ago.  Coincidentally, a link to the Kindle Fire version of [[ASIN:B008IV5OLS The Daily]] appeared as a recommendation after I \\"purchased\\" this free app.  Nice stroke of luck.<br /><br />This BBC News app really is an impressive implementation of BBC News on the Kindle Fire.  They did a great job of adapting their news content to the Kindle Fire device.<br /><br />The Setup page is very impressive.  The Setup allows you to pick which categories display on the list of articles. Interestingly enough, the non-US pages are turned off by default.  They're easy enough to select and activate though.  You can also drag-and-drop each of the categories to change their order on your page.  This is a great customization feature and a very simple way to personalize your page.<br /><br />This is a very impressive news experience.  I'm still glad I found The Daily, but I'll still add this BBC News app to my Favorites on my Fire's home page.  The fact that the app is free, there is no subscription cost, and there are no ads, this really is a great news source on the Fire.

0307744434|3.0|Did not meet my expectations.  I am giving this a 3 star, as it was not great, but it was not bad etiher.  I am struggling even with Good.  I bought this book (I recommend getting from library instead), based on the overview on the back.  The first few chapters were really interesting, and thought this book would be something unique and different.  I have to say that \\"A fierce competition\\" is a huge understatement.  Although the talents of the competitors are very impressive, you don't even realize what Marco is doing in regards to the competion until over half way through the book.  He spends most of his time hiding in the shadows of his employers dinner parties.  Stating that  \\"Celia and Marco soon tumble headfirst into love\\" is ridiculous - if you are lookinig for a love story - you will need to read until page 300 before they really even talk to eachother.  Almost another 100 pages before anything worthwhile between the 2 happen.  The best part of the book is in the last 100 pages and the story of Bailey, Poppet and Widget.  This book should have been reduced by 200 or more pages, and you would get more satisaction from the story.
B000FC2ROU|4.0|I read somewhere that the author has made it clear that you need to read this book a few times to fully understand it. When I started reading this book I COULD not put it down. I just wanted to understand how the characters are related and what will happen. Now I have started reading it the second time slowly giving the events time to settle hoping that I ll understand it better. I think you could write a whole thesis interpreting this book. Its a good read.
B004UG7RQ0|3.0|Summary: I got this product to allow my droid to play music through my retro fitted iPod connector in my bmw. The product arrived quickly and worked functionally right out of the package. While the sound quality is equivalent to plugging in an iDevice, the sound volume output is very low. Even with the volume all the way up on my droid device AND all the way up on my stereo the sound level is still not what I where I would prefer it to be. Maybe the Cablejive Dockboss seller will comment on why this is happening but I am on the fence for going with another solution.<br /><br />Like: quality, functional solution<br />Dislike: sound volume output

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This 2011 blockbuster, based on the novel by Kathryn Stockett, has reminded me  of the only aspect in the \\"Communist Manifesto\\" that Marx had 100 % right is that the workers and the poor can be exploited under a capitalist system.<br />  Thankfully in America, the situation can be improved by strikes, labor unions, petitions, the ability to sue employers, and what I would call the Dickensian approach( after Charles Dickens, whose well-known literary works helped reform British societal ills in the 19th century)--writing a good and effective expose.<br />  In the Mississippi of the early 1960s, the last of those becomes the objective of one young journalist, appropriately named Eugenia(Greek for \\"Well-born\\")\\"Skeeter\\" Phelan, a debutante, who, unlike most of her peers, feels there is more to life than bridge games, gossip, new dresses, and babies.<br /> A member of the Junior League, she is privy to the unjust aims of the local head of that organization, the villainous Hilly Holbrook(a firey Bryce Dallas Howard), whose petitions for the upscale homes in Jackson to have separate bathrooms for their non-white servants, due the the spread lie(highly reminiscent about those spread about Jews in Nazi Germany) that they carry different diseases than whites. These people who, while in many instances earning no real salaries, and who in some instances are willed to children by their masters, tend their gardens, clean their homes,  cook for them, and raise their children are deemed unfit to use their bathrooms!<br /> Also privy to this conversation is the middle aged maid narrating the story,Aibileen Clark( a world-weary Viola Davis), who works for Raleigh and Elizabeth Leefolt(Shane McRae, Ahna O'Reilly), and is the nanny to their toddler, Mae Mobley(Emma and Eleanor Henry). A neglectful mother to her child, Elizabeth, who is a weak-willed lackey to Hilly, is soon expecting another. We learn Aibileen has cared for 17 white children from the time she was in her early teens.<br/> In her Oscar winning turn as Minnie Jackson, the maid to the Holbrooks, Best Actress Octavia Spencer is a hard-bitten and sassy woman in a thankless job, and also raising six children while dealing with an abusive and drunken husband.<br /> Skeeter initially writes a newspaper column on housekeeping tips, some of which she gets from her girlfriends' housekeepers, and at home, she ponders the mysterious disappearance of the maid who loved and raised her, Constantine Jefferson(Cecily Tyson), an issue about which her ailing mother, Charlotte(Allison Janney) and her father, Robert(Brian Kerwin), are notoriously silent.<br /> As the Civil Rights struggle grows even further, Skeeter comes up with the idea of interviewing the maids of prominent families to inform the world of their plight in such crucial times. She contacts Harper and Row editor Elaine Stern(Mary Steenbergen) in New York, and through their phone conversations, we are led through various stages of the project's development. Notable moments in the Civil Rights battle are key to this aspect of the story as well.<br /> A side note to this story are the matchmaking attempts of both Charlotte and Hilly to fix Skeeter up with oil rig worker Stuart Whitworth(Chris Lowel). But Skeeter's project will have its impact even there.<br /> Encouraged by her pastor's(David Oyelowo) sermon about Moses, Aibileen, who keeps journals, reluctantly  begins her interview sessions with Skeeter, and Minnie eventually follows.We learn of the tragic death of Aibileen's son, Treelore, resulting from racist policies of the time, and follow  the blacks through innumerable slights and indignities.<br /> During a tornado, Minnie fans Hilly's dementia-plagued mother, Missus Walter(Sissy Spacek), and gets fired for not using the outdoor chamber despite the perilous weather. It is on this occasion that Missus Walter sums up Hilly's character in one sentence:\\"Daddy ruined you!\\"<br /> Appearing contrite due to her inability to find work after Hilly lied to other prominent families, saying Minnie was a thief, Minnie retaliates in a way that slaves --especially cooks had done in times past--by placing something unseemly in a food item and tricking the one who wronged them into eating it.Hilly will have the humiliation of having everyone in town know about it.<br /> There is a blatant irony to Hilly's presiding over a charity ball on behalf of starving children in Africa while treating the African descendants of her daily life with such contempt.<br /> As we discover, not only do those of Jackson's High Society dance to the music of those they are determined to keep as second class citizens, but Hilly's cruelty knows no racial bounds. She placed her own mother in a nursing home simply for laughing at what Minnie did to her.Skeeter gets in her digs at Hilly as well.<br /> Another person rejected by Hilly is the alleged bottle blonde, Celia Foote(played by Jessica Chastain with a Marilyn Monroe-like fragility). Deemed \\"White trash\\" by Hilly, et. al, she is married to Hilly's former sweetheart, Johnny Foote( Mike Vogel), and she is the only woman willing to give Minnie a job, especially since she needs to learn how to run a big upscale household.Minnie tends to her through one of her several miscarriages, and we see the sunny, bubbly beauty overcome social awkwardness to take a swipe at Hilly, and perform an act of kindness and gratitude that encourages Minnie to improve her life.<br /> The death of Medgar Evers encourages more maids to tell their stories to Skeeter despite great risks.<br /> Skeeter finally learns the truth about her own beloved Constantine's departure, which she is required to include in the book.<br /> \\"The Help\\" becomes a bestseller that causes quite a stir in Jackson.Hilly angrily denies the episode that all know pertains to her, and vows recriminations on those responsible.<br /> Aibileen and Minnie receive plaudits for their courage in church, Charlotte praises her daughter's courage, and the lives of the three female protagonists take different turns--in one case, at the expense of a little girl who loses the only person who truly cared for her at Hilly's command.<br /> But a final question asked of Hilly is one that could be asked of any perpetual hater with a vengeful streak: \\"Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly? Ain't you tired?\\"<br /> Aujanue Ellis plays the maid Yule Mae, who makes a fateful decision, Nelsan Ellis is Henry, the waiter,  LaChance is Constantine's daughter, Rachel,Ted Welch is William Holbrook, Ashley Johnson is Mary Beth Caldwell, and Anna Camp plays Jolene French.<br /> Under the masterful direction of Tate Taylor, and with an impressive score by Thomas Newman, audiences can review the truth about a not-too-distant time in American history in an emotion-laden and thought-provoking way.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series starts off kind of slow with the romance part, but takes you on a journey of a beautiful relationship. It shows you Ana's patience and understanding of Christian's insecurities. They are no different from anyone else,everyone has their our bag of issues. People think this series should be banned. I think there is nothing wrong with enjoying this series. What the fictional characters do in their bedroom or Red Room has no effect on who they are in the outside world. Just like any couple who consents to this type of relationship it's their business. I liked the book because like Christian says in the book I'm not hearts and flowers. If this book / series was all hearts and flowers no one would have read it and fussed about it. This is an awesome read I am about to read this a second time around and I just purchased the first book on Saturday. My advice buy the first book try it if you don't like it at least preview the second book. I will admit after the 1st book I wasn't in love with the series. Then I previewed the 2nd book and I was hooked! Happy reading :)

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought that the writer introduced the characters very well.  I enjoyed the story although it did make me blush several times.  Before this book, I had never read such descriptive encounters.
0345803507|2.0|I only made it to Book 3 because I committed to seeing the story through.  This has got to be the most repetitive, annoying, juvenile, unbelievable story I have ever suffered through.  The author's main mission is to make sure you, the reader, know - WITHOUT ANY SHRED OF DOUBT - that Christian is the most gorgeous man on the planet and every single woman in the entire universe is gaga over him.  Every single female character in this book (except his lesbian assistant, his mother, and his sister) \\"gapes, open-mouthed\\" at Christian, as if they've never seen an attractive man before (it escapes the author that the world is full of them). Also, you must understand, WITHOUT ANY SHRED OF DOUBT - that Anastasia is the most beautiful, desirable woman who ever walked the earth because every single male character in the book lusts after her: from her roommate's brother, to her artist friend, to every male co-worker she comes into contact with, to some random guy in an elevator, you get the picture.  Yes, and when they frolic on the beach on their honeymoon all eyes are on them.  yeah, because the rest of the people on this earth are ugly, dull, and boring and the only interesting people worthy of our stares are Christian and Anastasia. Give me a break!!!!  Also, you - dear reader - have never had great sex before.  That is reserved only for Christian and Ana.  This comes out when Ana is thinking to herself that her sexually experienced roommate, Kate, would have told her how great sex was if she had ever had it this good.  Once again, give me a break. This book is insulting to the reader - does the author really expect us to like these characters, especially Ana??  All she does is bite her lip, roll her eyes, talk about how \\"he is mine, mine\\".  Oh, and lets not forget that Christian also happens to be the richest CEO in the world - with a too much friggin' time on his hands as he rarely works, and even when he does, if Ana so much as sneezes he drops everything, no matter howimportant, to get her a tissue.

B00130EVSS|5.0|I loved this movie  the acting was really good and the story was too.  It was pretty graphic and violent but that didn't bother me too much because the movie was that good.  Wish hollywood would make more good movies like this one.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I just finished the mortal instruments series and was still trying fill some sort of reading void. Amazon suggested this book. So since it was only a couple bucks I said, why not!<br /><br />This book was totally awesome. I loved the characters. I'm sitting at work on my lunch break trying to hide my tears.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, especially if your looking for just a good wholesome book. I know 50 shades of grey is supposed to be all the rage now, but I don't get it. This book has no sex, no bondage, and it's totally awesome!

0743201140|5.0|Only 20% of employees in large organizations worldwide feel they capitalize on their strengths every day.  This is according to Gallup surveys covering 1.7 million employees in 101 companies from 63 countries.  Paradoxically, the longer tenures and higher level positions within companies reduce this percentage.  The most efficiently managed companies using strengths based methods can increase this rate to about 50% of employees, which speaks to the difficult nature of employing a strengths based approach.  The dividends, however, are worth the effort.  Miscast employees are unhappy employees and not as productive as they can be.<br /><br />This book and the StrengthsFinder profile included are designed to identify your dominant talents, which may not necessarily be strengths yet.  Moreover, finding strengths is not just an individual effort.  Every manager should take the time to understand employee talents and cultivate them.  That is the definition of management excellence and a strengths based team.  Capitalize on strengths and neutralize weaknesses to retain top talent.  The secret to improvement lies in a deep understanding of strengths.<br /><br />\\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\" is an excellent follow up to the hugely successful management book, \\"First, Break All the Rules\\", and should be required reading for all employees, and particularly management.
B003L20IHO|5.0|This is a really great movie. Mr. Efron plays the key role of Charlie St. Cloud, a role that requires an actor that can show vulnerability as well as skill and determination. His emotional core is the center of the film, and Mr. Efron pulls it all off. His performance is outstanding. The relationship between him and his little brother was very true to life, and his romance with a woman who is about to do something he has longed to do, was quite realistic and touching. His connection with the spirit world is handled with great sensitivity and understanding. The supporting actors are all excellent. The actor who plays his buddy is very funny, and the two actors playing his brother and his love interest are quite good. The plot is very interesting and moves along very nicely. Excellent movie, buy it so you can watch again and again.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Wow, where to begin?  First, let me say I acquired Pocket Informant and removed it from my Kindle Fire and phone.  On the Fire, it will not sync to Google calendar and there is no way to keep all your calendars in sync.  Second, I kept the calendar on my phone for awhile until I couldn't take its bugginess.  It was just unstable and too buggy for my tastes.  And when you contacted the developer to report the bug, the response was always the same \\"we are unable to replicate the problem you reported.\\"  Funny thing, was after suffering for weeks with the bug they would quietly release an update  But unfortunately, for every update that addressed one problem two or three new bugs would appear in the new release.<br /><br />Now, enter Calengoo.  Everything that Pocket Informant wasn't, Calengoo is.  It is extremely stable and loaded with functions galore.  You can customize the calendar anyway you please, from how you view it on your device to setting up custom color schemes.  I have different schemes for weekly, monthly, daily and agenda views.  Try that with Pocket Informant!  Best yet, all versions sync with Google calendar so your calendar shows the same events across every device you own.  Better yet, I\\"ve used Calengoo for a year now and not once have I experienced a crash  nor has the developer introduced any bugs with upgrades.  During that year the developer has only added more and more features.  It also has a To Do menu that can be activated and tasks can show on the calendar on the date due with an alarm to remind you, if you desire.<br /><br />Calengoo is worth every penny it costs and deserves a full five star rating.
1419703692|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo22HYNWXL30NYN]]This is the making-of rather than an art-and-making-of book. So you're not going to see a lot of art. The only other artbook for the Dark Knight trilogy was [[ASIN:0811849481 The Art of Batman Begins]] and that wasn't very good in terms of art and content.<br /><br />Having said all that, this is a great movie companion book.<br /><br />It covers in detail all the three films and the complete production process. You get to read about the screenplay, production design, casting, use of visual and special effects, music and marketing. The book is packed with nice photos of the set, actors, props and vehicles, and some art illustrations.<br /><br />There are chapters for the shooting of each film which I thought was short considering the length of the movies. Still, it provides great insight into how the movie was shot, and the little clues were put into each film to tie them together. You get a sense of Christopher Nolan's film making philosophy, and understand how the film was directed. He has done an incredible job portraying on big screen one of the most recognisable comic characters.<br /><br />There are lots of interesting information throughout the book. Like how Anne Hathaway dressed up as Harley Quinn during a casting meeting because she misread the script, or why Nolan even considered using actual bats but ultimately turned to animated ones.<br /><br />Of all the books relating to the Dark Knight trilogy, this is probably the best.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of the movies. It's a terrific deal for a 304-page hardcover.
B000TDGGRY|4.0|I like James Rollins' books because they are well researched and always explore little known historical.  This book focuses on Marco Polo's exploration to the far East and ties the plot into the current issue with bacterial changes that are occurring on the ocean floor.<br /><br />The action in this one is nonstop and almost made me feel like I was on a roller coaster at times.  Rollings develops the plot by following one character for several chapters and then switching to  another character.  At any given time there are four to five characters who have plot lines that are being developed.  Many books try this approach following a formula in which three characters are involved where the author devotes one chapter to a character before switching to another.  Not only is that style of writing formulistic, it can be annoying.  Rollins avoids any formula writing and deftly weaves developments from each character into the plot narrative.<br /><br />The ending was one of those types that I've seen criticized in other books.  However, Rollins makes it work and that's all I'll say, for fear of giving the ending away.<br /><br />If you haven't read any of this author's work, then you owe it to yourself to start with the first book in the Sigma Series and read them through to the end.  The Sigma Series is one of the best, if not the best, spy type genres that are being published today.
B003AVPV1O|2.0|I have two monitors connected to my PC and ended splitting the 24\\" Samsung (HDTV - 1080 p) monitor signal from the video card as output to a 32\\" Samsung HDTV (700p). Native resolution on the 24\\" Samsung is 1920/1200. The 32\\" TV could not handle that mode which caused the video card to back down the resolution on the 24\\" Samsung. I could not have my cake (high res on PC monitor) and eat it too (same high res of something close on 32\\" TV). So, if you are splitting a signal that will be of comparable resolution you'll be all set. The splitter (and/or the video card) could not handle resolution disparity.
B003ES61EE|5.0|What else can I say. It is small enough to fit in my small camera bag (for a Sony NEX-C3) and not take up much room. Works well, cheap, and comes in nice cardboard packaging that requires no knives, hacksaws, or explosives to open.

B000HL2EBU|4.0|So Archer and Co. finally find something worth exploring....A PLANET...and it's a Minshara (class M)...and the people look identical to humans....except with forehead ridges.....and they sound Portuguese. Personally I think it's a 1 in a trillion chance that if we actually do find life besides our own it will look anything like us, but then again real life doesn't have a makeup and prosthetics budget :)<br /><br />I really enjoyed this week's episode; you get to see the Feds before they adhered to the Prime Directive (did they really adopt it from the Vulcans?), and the story and action were entertaining.
B0063GORYU|4.0|short sweet and simply said I think its fun they could change it up a little but what do you expect for free?
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a great game that is very addicting.  my feedback would be to add a more in depth turtorial.
B00753MBHA|5.0|First things first-these guys show everyone who plays metal just how it's done. I only knew of accept through their song \\"Balls to the Wall. I liked the song, just a bit more party-metal for my taste. I listen to so many styles of music that I sometimes miss out or hear about a killer album well after the album first comes out. The guys from the TV program \\"That metal show\\" gave props to another accept CD called Blood of the Nations. Thank you Eddie, Don & Jim!! Blood of the Nations is an aweseome CD!! Accept may have a new lead singer in Mark Tornillo but have not lost any of their explosive sound. I never would of guessed the follow up album Stelingrad would be just as well, explosive!! The solos from Wolf are amazing and will pierce your ears to obilivion! All of the tracks are thunderous, but make sure you crank your speakers WAAAYY UP when \\"Hellfire\\" is playing. My God, sounds like the theme for the world ending,surrounded by blazing guitars, pounding drums and true metal chops. There is far to much candy-cane metal and goopy hard rock music to deal with, sure is good to know that Accept just keeps metal music raw & the real deal.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Title says it. sliders for hue help adjust for color casts, and there are a wide variety of other tools, frames and effects, all laid out nicely.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This book is very well written and the author's words take you to great places.  It is almost like classic literature.  But like all well-written books, the plot ebbs and flows.  There were times I wasn't sure I liked it and other times I couldn't put it down.  At the end of the day (or the few days it took me to read it), I decided that it is a great book that I will not forget soon.  I like books that tear at my emotions, make me feel something special for the characters, and interest me in the characters' stories.  Books that take me away into their worlds.  This book does all that and more. I highly recommend it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Me gusta mucho la utilizo en mi trabajo y cuando hago mis compras personales. La recomiendo. Creo que les gustara.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|This movie is a new classic. The story is very streamlined and clean while the animation is quite superb. For those older who read the original comics it is a great, nostalgic blast from the past. For the younger people, it is another great animated story. Cannot go wrong with this.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|You know what? This was just a little bit overblown in the hype department....its an okay story with so-so writing, I dunno know, I'm not a better person for having read this and frankly I found the plot a but much, it was ...so-so
B005FIO3PU|1.0|I Bought this as i wanted a small light for working on the keyboard.  The light arrived with 1 dead LED which i was prepared to put up with as it put out enough light.

1592536913|5.0|I've had the pleasure of meeting Doc Grymm prior to purchasing this book and was thoroughly impressed by his enthusiasm and devotion to the art of steampunk. I expected the book to reflect that devotion and was not disappointed. The quality is superb and the selection of steampunk art is as thorough as I think is possible. My wife and I have spent quite a bit of time going through the book and continue to be inspired each time we go back through it. Well done Sir! Can't wait to get my other Grymm book about how to draw steampunk.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|i've been checking out their songs on youtube and they're def. a different type of boy band. so i go to best buy, i buy their cd (only 1 left!!) and i'm so addicted to it!!! it's right up there with justin timberlake's 'futuresex/lovesounds' and britney's 'blackout' [if you're a huge pop fan like me.]<br /><br />i'm fast becoming a huge fan and i totally see why they're getting so big around the world.  the top songs for me are: what makes you beautiful [i immediately bought the song when i first heard it and then that's when i started learning more about the group], up all night, everything about you, gotta be you, one thing and i want.  basically, the whole album is great to listen to, but again, anyone who likes pop music and esp. boy bands will love this cd.  or if you just want a good pop album their sound is very different from anyone else, i can't even compare them to any past boy bands...that's how unique their sound is.
0062209493|5.0|This ranks among the very best books I've read! It has plenty of \\"red meat\\" for those of us who like that stuff, but it also brings home the sacrifice that every Servicemember and their families make during long, multiple deployments. Very well written. It's an honest account (sometimes too honest) of BUDs, train ups and combat from the perspective of a hard charging Navy SEAL.<br />Great book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Just started yesterday and cannot stop! Would be cool if it had a hint feature for when you get stuck. By far one of the best free apps or games period for Android.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|I had not bothered to check the reviews here at Amazon before I invested two hours in watching this thing. Wish I had. Could have read a book instead. Or cleaned the garage. But I bought into all the Academy Award hype over it and was blindsided. What a waste of time.<br /><br />After a very slooooooow, tedious start and about 15 minutes into it, I eventually figured out that the storyline was going to be a series of flashbacks as almost random filler to an invented story devoting most of its duration to showing Margaret Thatcher as a senile old woman, engaging in numerous conversations with her deceased husband. Those flashbacks occurred so randomly, I was not even clear as to whether those conversations were with the living or with the deceased Mr. Thatcher.  The timeline seemed haphazard and, even for someone like me who was living and aware during the Thatcher years, it was certainly confusing. This movie should never be used as remotely presenting historical fact.<br /><br />A movie about a public figure should be about that persons public life and importance to their country and the world, possibly extended with private struggles that took place during the period of service if there is some justifiable significance. However, that person's private retirement is irrelevant. Further, a movie about the tragedy of dementia should have some sort of social significance and learning value. This one fails on both counts.<br /><br />The film is not totally without its merits. Yes, in her lucid scenes Lady Thatcher is shown as a woman of principle, determination, courage and will of iron as the title suggests. But those are limited and serve just as interrupters to all the crazy scenes. Yes, Merrill Streep's acting is superb. She captures the Lady's character and presence amazingly well. Those strengths, however, cannot sufficiently offset a bizarre plot, a dismal made-up script, excessive flip-flopping, incorporation of stale file footage from the 80's and overall dullmovie. A sadly missed opportunity. One star from me. Read a book instead.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|Rented it last week, bought it just now.  Great cinematography, great acting, intelligent screenplay.  One of the Amazon reviewers giving this film only one star awarded \\"John Carter\\" five of them.  Nuff said.
0345529057|5.0|Bought this set after watching the first two seasons of \\"Game of Thrones\\" on HBO.  I originally thought these books would hold me over until Season 3 (April 2013), but unfortunately, I read all four books in less than a month!<br /><br />This series is seriously addictive, and this particular set looks great for the price I paid.  I ordered \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" in the same format, but the release date changed from September 2012 to April 2013!!!<br /><br />Anyways... buy this set, you won't be disappointed.

I also wish it had more games besides just one.  The game is somewhat addictive because you want to see how far you can go and what's to come next.

B0082LUEW8|4.0|Finally, Hellyeah finds their groove. Their first two albums were decent but still  kinda hokey and gimmick-y, but now with \\"Band of Brothers,\\" this heavy metal melting pot shows the world that they're much more mountain than molehill.<br /><br />Some may say that it's a bit too similar to Pantera's gritty, Southern-friend brand of groove metal, and they are right (\\"Drink Drank Drunk\\" has Dimebag written all over it). Of course, Vinnie Paul is in Hellyeah, so there will always be some similarity, but Hellyeah modernizes the Pantera redneck-metal swagger with a bit more melody and Chad Gray's voice brings a vicious intensity that is more scream than snarl.<br /><br />This is raucous party metal meant to blared at full volume at a biker gang rager, and Hellyeah isn't trying to mint a new metal coin. They've just found what works for them, and honestly, I'm glad they've stepped up to give groove metal the respect it deserves.

B005OSUKSA|5.0|David Garrett is an amazing violin player. With this album he plays the classics with a renewed vigor stemming from his classical upbringing on the violin and his more modern exhilarating  style. His playing is true to the style of the genre of the music. The mix of works chosen is well balanced with the Beethoven concerto followed by the assortment of beautiful pieces. Fantastic!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I don't understand why people are complaining.  Maybe if they had read the description, they would have known what they were purchasing.  It is what it is - The Harry Potter DVD collection in their theatrical release in an attractive case, sleeve, and original DVD artwork, just as described.  Nowhere does it say that it is a Deluxe Edition, Extended Collection, or The Be All End All Definitive Box Set.<br /><br />They are in Widescreen format and are of great quality by DVD standards.  If you want just the movies without all the bells and whistles, this collection is for you.  They're roughly $9 a film and will suit your needs and expectations.<br /><br />Mischief managed.

B003TXSF5C|1.0|While no-one can argue the rightfully earned position occupied by Stephen Hawking in the world of modern physics, that doesn't mean he and Leonard Mlodinow can write, or express complex ideas well. This effort falls well short of any of the hype and positive reviews it has received. Too many concepts are explained for the hundredth time (such as time dilation or the double slit experiment); if the reader doesn't already understand these ideas, they have absolutely no chance of understanding them from this book. If they do understand them already, they have seen a dozen explanations that do a far better job of unveiling quantum peculiarities and possibilities. The book also declares on the first page that philosophy is dead, but then later re-invokes it many times, although their use of non-scientific terms, such as philosophy, are literally \\"tossed around\\" without any of the precision, attention to detail, or supposed research that is a must in a book like this. After a weak tour of physics 101 covered poorly for 175 pages they then use only the last couple of pages to show us how the universe came out of nothing - after previously explaining quantum jitters!!!! How can these fields possibly represent \\"nothing\\" from which the universe came and where is the explanation of where the quantum jitters or gravity came from for that matter. And if the point with The Game of Life is to show us how life came from nothing, it is no wonder the theologians and philosophers are jumping all over this gaping failure in trying to make the whole point of the book. Lest you believe I'm bashing this from a Christian viewpoint, I am a physicist who simply would like to see this material presented more effectively to the world. Check out anything by Brian Greene!!

B00846REIS|5.0|The only thing I did not like is how short this novel is. I found it much more realistic than 50 shades but either way I believe anyone could read this book and enjoy it at some level. My husband is over seas and these books give me ideas lol.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Just as the first one, this one is even more action packed and well done. If anything, too much foreshadowing of an event before it happens instead of at the end like the first movie. Still excellent and worth every penny. I've watched both movies three times already and would be happy to watch again. Everyone in the movie plays their parts well and especially Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law, Noomi Rapace (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Original Swedish Version & better than the recent remake of TGWTDT)and especially Jared Harris(Mad Men & many other fine roles)Harris is an amazing actor. I see where some people complain because it really isn't strict to Holmes original time frame or character or something silly like that but these are fun, well made, intriguing, funny, action packed, well detailed movies with amazing top drawer actors and produced excellent. I for one have no complaints and thoroughly enjoy them to the max. Somewhat like James Bond movies, can't wait for the next one and Downey Jr and Law make perfect Holmes & Watson. They interact and play off each other beyond belief. OK, I think i'll go watch them again while I wait for the third one to be made.......Spider K Blues
B005K17RU0|4.0|it has been wrong a couple of times. other than that it was pretty good. would recommend it to my friends.
0439023491|2.0|Writing Quality: 4/10.<br />The writing quality of this second novel in the series is no different than the first. So I won't belabor the point, you can just go back and see what I wrote for The Hunger Games. I'll just add that Katniss' internal monologues are as boring and insipid as ever. And the first-person is still glaringly awkward, as you'll note in this example:<br /><br />I think my tongue has frozen and speech will be impossible, so I surprise myself by answering back in a steady voice, \\"Yes, I think that would save time.\\"<br /><br />Or the bit where she explains that \\"because this is so repellent to think about, my mind frantically tries to change topics.\\" The way she describes things, she often seems to be floating outside of her own body, an awkward and casual observer.<br /><br />Depth of Concept: 4/10.<br />I raised this category one point over my review of The Hunger Games simply because Collins bothers to describe a little more of the unrest and political/social climate in the districts. None of it is very insightful, but at least it's addressed, which means that any interpretation of the novel by necessity must include some accounting for large-scale oppression, sacrifices, and rebellion. But it's as frustrating as ever that Katniss never seems to think she has any other option than to kill for the pleasure of the viewing public. She's sad about it, but the fact that she can't even imagine refusing demonstrates a real gap in logic that's hard to understand. I keep thinking of the book Alive by Piers Paul Read, which details the story of a bunch of plane crash survivors in the Andes. With no rescue on the way, the survivors have to decide whether they are willing to eat each other to survive. Some are willing, some are not. But everyone considers the choice carefully. In Catching Fire, the fact that Katniss can't even conceive of the option of refusal as a path to rebellion, and peace of mind, seems surprising. It makes her a much weaker character than many fans make her out to be. And since she's still thinking about killing her friends in the arena much as she did in the first book, it's clear that the experience hasn't really taught her anything.<br /><br />Rounded Characters: 4/10.<br />I raised this one point over my review of The Hunger Games. I don't know if it was warranted. At a 4, it's still sub-par, and painful to dwell on, but Collins does spend a little more time exploring the relationships between characters. Even more than before, I'm irritated by the way Katniss wallows in angst regarding her love triangle, but at least we get a little more depth from it. We still end up with a character like President Snow who starts monologuing like a cliched villain the moment he meets Katniss, and we still learn nothing about him other than he smells faintly of blood, whatever that means. You almost expect him to be carrying a fluffy mean-eyed cat that he strokes as he talks. We learn some interesting things about characters like Haymitch and Plutarch and Cinna, but you'd still be hard-pressed to go back and find any inkling of these secrets in the early chapters, and certainly not in the first book. There's never any real explanation for Katniss' affection for her prep team, the team that makes her look pretty on the way to her death. What does she like about them? And Katniss herself is full of contradiction. For instance, she says at one point that her passion for \\"designing clothes\\" is nonexistent, but we still get a multitude of florid descriptions of every piece she wears, and how beautiful she finds every piece Cinna makes for her, both in this and the first novel. It seems that Collins sometimes tries to separate Katniss from attachment to fashion and the material things of the Capitol, but just can't quite do the job in a way that makes sense. A review for Catching Fire on Collins' web page puts it this way: \\"Gladiator\\" meets \\"Project Runway\\" in Suzanne Collins's gripping dystopian novel \\"The Hunger Games\\" and its new sequel, \\"Catching Fire.\\"<br /><br />Well-Developed World: 4/10.<br />I rated this one point lower than in my review of The Hunger Games, for a few reasons, despite the fact that we're actually given a lot more information about the world of Panem. To sum it up, there are just too many inconsistencies. First, we're told that President Snow knows about a secret kiss that was shared by Katniss and Gale while in the forest, which seems like a no-brainer given how easy it was for the Capitol to have both video and audio watching every breath of the tributes in the arena. But Katniss and others still somehow feel that they can elude the eyes and ears of the Capitol, over and over again, despite being of utmost interest to the powers-that-be. And apparently it works, in a whole slew of inconsistent situations. We're led to believe that the Capitol is virtually all-powerful and all-knowing, and yet a few high-profile bumbling teenagers can avoid its awareness by simply going for a walk as they discuss state secrets? Second, since the Capitol has been set up to be so powerful, able to control minute events and even to edit footage to their advantage, there's no reason it couldn't just kill off Katniss and her troublesome companions and construct some pleasant fiction to explain it. Third, we still get no exploration of what kind of person the average citizen of the Capitol is, or whether Katniss' prep team is indicative of it. Fourth, the idea that the president of an oppressive regime personally conducts business with a hostile seventeen-year-old girl, and that we get no hint of other bureaucrats or intermediate government cronies seems a little far-fetched. I could go on, but you get the idea. The one single detail that I found interesting about the over-the-top habits in the Capitol that Collins could have explored further was the moment she describes people purging in restrooms in order to continue feasting. This could have been a segue into a thoughtful metaphor for excess . . . but it's really only mentioned briefly in passing. Also . . . I still have no idea what kind of population stats are involved in the world of Panem. Thousands?  Millions? Billions? And why are Katniss, Peeta, and the rest allowed to bring emblems of the revolution into the arena?<br /><br />Page Turner: 6/10.<br />The thing The Hunger Games really had going for it was how gripping a read it was. Most of the novel involved teens hunting each other down and killing each other, and it's hard to look away from that. This novel doesn't get to the arena until the last third of the novel, and it frankly isn't as interesting even when we get there. Still, whatever other faults Collins may have as a prose artist, her prose is still pretty snappy, and the plot moves along at a pretty good pace. While I was frequently rolling my eyes while reading, it was never so bad that I stopped turning the pages. But I never felt like staying up late finishing the book, because there just wasn't the immediacy of danger that made the first novel so suspenseful.<br /><br />Kept Me Thinking: 4/10.<br />While I was happy to see a little more exploration of the political and social climate in the world of Panem, it was never the sort that made me reconsider any of my beliefs or that made me consider anything from another perspective. And I don't consider myself any sort of expert in studying this sort of thing. I wonder if Collins would have written any differently if she'd had the news items of the Arab Spring to use as a model. A very young person might feel that they're learning something, but as an adult, I didn't feel like there was enough original or complex exploration to keep me thinking very much.<br />___________________________________________________<br /><br />Overall Recommendation: 4/10.<br />I dropped this a point in recommendation for the primary reason that it's just not as gripping as The Hunger Games, which was the main reason I saw for reading that first novel. There are a few things that Catching Fire makes an attempt to address that were lacking in the first book, but the improvements are not enough to really make a difference.<br /><br />See my profile web page for an expanded review and other thoughts.tful metaphor for excess . . . but it's really only mentioned briefly in passing.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really enjoyable game.  Keeps your mind working.  Caution to men with wives smarter than them, it'll be really frustrating when she's on level ten billion and you're still on level seven.
0545259096|4.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book. Shiver was amazing and Linger was one of those books that I felt just went in a complete circle. I had high hopes that Forever would actually move the story forward.<br /><br />While I didn't love Forever as much as Shiver, I did love how Stiefvater handled it. With Grace turning at the end of Linger, I was really worried that she was going to drag out the separation between Grace and Sam. There was separation, but it felt so important to the story because you know how much these two characters love each other and that with every day the possibilities for them to be together become harder. When they finally come together, it's in such a simple and comfortable way. I love that they're aren't constantly gushing over each other or doubting each other just to make it more dramatic. They are a simple love story and I love that.<br /><br />But even with Grace and Sam keeping things simple in the love department, Cole and Isabel bring the drama. They fight, love, despise, lust. And they finally feel like solid characters that are developed enough to share in Grace and Sam's plot.<br /><br />I've read a number of reviews by people who were disappointed in the ending of this trilogy, but for me it was perfect, at least for Grace and Sam. Now Cole and Isabel are a different story. I would have liked one more chapter for them, but it comes back to who's story is it? Grace and Sam's.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I found it a bit too romantic but enthralling. It's been a while since I read a really page-turning book and this was it! Since the first book I couldn't let it down.

034580404X|5.0|I didn't read the reviews for this series until I finished it.  I am astonished as to how some people compare the writing and the story line to the Twilight series.  Yes, I have read Twilight!  50 Shades Series 10x better!  I've felt awkward after reading the series recommending the book; however that didn't stop me.  I've recommended this series to over 10 women who have all followed and read all 3 books, who are in love with the characters as I am.  Please don't let the negative reviews detour you from reading this series.  I recommend at least trying the first book; I promise you wont regret it!!

B007ME5BUG|5.0|Yet another highly detailed account of a very complex event.  Provides an excellent timeline of the war which is very helpful in understanding how and why it all took place.  Typical Beevor.  Enjoyed it as much as his other books!
0425263908|3.0|\\"Bared To You\\" is definitely hot, and if you loved \\"Fifty Shades of Gray,\\" you might like this even more.<br /><br />But, you know, some of us are in our forties and fifties and sixties, and the sort of people who seem hot in \\"Bared to You\\" wouldn't give us a second glance. Alas! If that fits you, and you would sort of like to read a novel in which the characters are \\"full grown\\" in several senses of the word, yet still erotic and very much turned on by each other, along with juicy sex scenes that are nevertheless within the realm of possibility and pleasure, you should have a look at \\"Womanly Woman, An Erotic Romance.\\" It's a fast read, but there are scenes one wants to, well, meditate on for awhile as one's fingers do the walking. It leaves you wanting a sequel and makes people like us feel that there may be hope for us, after all.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love Perry the Platypus, so this app naturally caught my eye. I am not the biggest fan of the original &quot;Where's My Water?&quot;, but I live this app! It's really creative with the Inators, different forms of water, and the voices. This app will surely entertain anyone - kids and adults alike! I especially love finding the files. in other words, buy the app! :)<br />Thank you Disney for this amazing app!

B000059MEL|5.0|This product mostly concerns the quality of the vinyl pressing of Daft Punk's Discovery. I can honestly say that I love buying electronica music on vinyl due to the limitless quality of the effects used in the music, and this vinyl is no different. The Packaging is very sharp and looks very high quality. The Vinyl comes with 2 records, with each side being designated with the tracks. The records feel very sturdy, although they are not heavyweight 180 grams vinyls. But rest assured, these records aren't cheap feeling and the sound reflects that. There's absolutely no distortion of the sound on any of the tracks, the bass is ridiculously tight and packs a solid punch from my sub every beat. The best example on the album is Crescendolls on side B. If you loved this album on CD, get it on vinyl!!!! Highly recommended.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fantastic game, great evolution of &quot;Where's My Water&quot;. Worth the 99 cents! I would recommend this game to all Phineas and Ferb fans.
B006TZBGBW|5.0|How can you go wrong? Every album ever produced by the greatest heavy metal band of all time! I had almost all of these releases previously, but several of them were still in the form of cassettes. To purchase these CD's separately would cost a fortune. Do the math. $110.00 (includes shipping cost) for 17 CD's; that's only $6.50 per CD. Not to mention that Judas Priest's early releases(particularly the 1st 3 albums) were difficult to find.  Here they all are in one convenient small cube. I had originally went looking for the box set 'Metology\\" which was released in early 2000's, because I somehow lost the one I had, and when I saw THIS box set with every JP album, and the price, I was doing back flips around my computer room here at home!!!! This is a must have for all Judas Priest fans, and all METAL fans, for that matter!!

B0052RE4MQ|1.0|I loved Condie's first novel Matched.  It was exciting to read, and I didn't mind that it was like every other dystopian book out there. Matched set up a great premise for Crossed.  Crossed was UNBEARABLE to read!  I probably read less than half of it and I stopped.  I could not stand how the point of view constantly changes, the story got so bland, and the narrators kept sounded the same.  I will not be buying the next book that comes out.  Condie has lost me as a reader. Hey, at least while I was reading the Hunger Games Suzanne Collins waited until the last book for the let down, not the second one.

B007SGM084|5.0|good grief! Anyone else find themselves a blubbery mess at specific points in this Trilogy?<br />Sometimes I found myself gripping something in my hands during those Crazy, stressful high points of the story---sheesh! (I'm not referring to the extreme 'intimacy' between them either...but it is an important part in understanding why Christian is who he is) I think this is where people put up their own mental 'block' during the first book, saying they hated it and hated Christian. Even I wondered if I could read the entire trilogy at first. But as I pressed on, I found myself fully involved in the story line.<br /><br />MY SYNOPSIS:<br /> *Book 1- is a straight, 'in your face' story of Christian Grey's lifestyle & personalty and his early relationship with Ana and their early struggles. (which is what made alot of people cringe and not want to read any further)<br />*Book 2- begins to delve further into Christian's life story/history, including those personally affected by him (past relationships and family) & his current tumultous, up & down relationship with Ana.<br />*Book 3- delivers powerful reasons/explanations for his life story, expanding on Christian's & Anastasia's relationship and understanding & love for one another. We finally find out the deep rooted reasons for Christian's 'fifty shades.'<br /><br />This trilogy takes you on an emotional rolercoaster. Every emotion you can have--it's in there. It has comedic value, heart-wrenching moments, in your face drama and alot of love and passion.<br /><br />I still cannot figure out why so many complained on how awful they thought the books were. Were these books a literary masterpiece? No, they weren't. BUT, anyone with a 'heart' and an open mind should find these a great read. I can easily overlook the author's repetitiveness in the books and lack of 'perfect writing skills.' (this is fiction people...)<br /> These books are not simply 'black' and 'white' either. They have alot of 'grey' areas.(pun intended)<br /> It is a love story and a story of healing---two people entangled in a tumultuous relationship in which, one, Christian Grey, whom has alot of inner demons, tries to break free from them, learning alot about himself in the process. While his girlfriend, Anastasia Steele, desperately tries every which way she can, to try to help him 'break free.'<br /><br /> It has plenty of 'thrilling' moments to keep you (well for me anyways) engulfed, 'sucked in', not wanting to put it down. You can't help but feel the intensity of their relationship and their inner struggles to make it work.<br /><br />All in all, these were a great read. I hope to see the author 'expand' on Christian's perspective in a future book(s). She totally left us 'hanging' at the end.<br /><br />I will definitely check into any other future novels by her. And I can't wait to see what she throws at us next.r /> It is a love story and a story of healing---two people entangled in a tumultuous relationship in which, one, Christian Grey, whom has alot of inner demons, tries to break free from them, learning alot about himself in the process.

B00365EVWE|5.0|Very good sound quality and comfort to wear. The box looks old but it's not a used product. I guess that they can not sell this device at list price, so they finally reduce the price to clear the stock.<br /><br />The bass is excellent and precise. The product name on Amazon does not have anything that indicates the bass sound. However, the product box has big print \\"Precise Bass\\".<br /><br />The product is made in China. The instruction manual has sections for different languages, however all sections are in English but not \\"bad Chinese English\\". So, I don't think that it's fake.

B004LWZW7Y|4.0|Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) teams up with his estranged childhood friend Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) and a female rogue named Kitty Soft Paws (Salma Hayek) to steal the magic beans from Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) so they can climb the beanstalk to the Giant's castle, where riches presumably await them.<br /><br />The character of Puss In Boots was a consistent scene stealer in the Shrek films, so it was natural to give him the spotlight.  I'm glad director Chris Miller and his screenwriters (William Davies, Brian Lynch, and Tom Wheeler) crafted a film that was worthy of him.  It continues the Shrek tradition of mashing fairy tales together while turning them on their heads, producing memorable characters and lots of funny moments.  Much of the comedy is drawn from Puss's Latin lover personality and lampooning actual feline behavior.  Very funny and cute.

B00817ZRRU|5.0|I fancy myself an avid reader. I find that with most books I can tell if I'm going to like them within the first 2 chapters regardless of the fact that I have only left one book unfinished in my life.  As an American, I found the beginning of the book a bit cumbersome as I am unfamiliar with some of the places and the Swedish justice system. I am thrilled that I did not judge this book based on that short period of adjustment.  Once you are in, there is no getting out until you have completed the book.  At that point, I immediately went out and read the next 2 in the trilogy. You find as you are reading that this book slowly wraps its arms around you until you just can't help but go along for the amazing roller coaster ride of suspense & intrigue.  Don't pass up the chance to sit back and enjoy the ride this thriller takes you on!

0345803485|1.0|I gave this book 158 pages, but I will give it no more.  In a word, it was terrible.  The female protagonist is every romance novel cliche - innocent/inexperienced, strikingly beautiful (but she doesn't know it), \\"too skinny\\", smart, etc. etc.  The male protagonist is equally bad - described more than once as an \\"Adonis\\" who has mastered the piano, learned to fly helicopters, and amassed a billion dollar empire at the age of 26.  And for some unfathomable reason, there's just something \\"about\\" the female protagonist... he can't resist her no matter how hard he tries (and he DOES try, since he knows he is \\"no good\\" for her).  Sigh and double sigh.  At least Twilight had vampires.<br /><br />I put the term \\"too skinny\\" in quotation marks above, because those were the author's words, not mine.  This is a total pet peeve of mine.  For some reason, authors like to describe their heroines as \\"too skinny\\", as if they are throwing a bone to the healthy-size-is-beautiful crowd while still keeping their heroines slender and willowy.  Ugh.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have noted on here about how sexist this book is, as well.  The guy commands the girl that she must obey him in all things, controlling her life so minutely as to when/what she is permitted to eat, how often she must exercise, etc.  The majority of the rules seemed aimed at keeping her as the typical male chauvinist picture of female beauty.  Furthermore,  she is told that she must always keep her eyes downcast unless he gives her permission to look him in the eye.  Are you kidding me?!  Thank you, 50 Shades of Grey, for setting us back 50 Years of You Suck.  Maybe this is my misunderstanding of the whole sub/dom culture coming out, but I don't get it and I'm offended by the notion.  Maybe I'm meant to be a dom.  :-)  But I digress.<br /><br />The writing is really horrendous, and I couldn't discern any sort of plot outside of \\"they have sex a lot\\".  The main character also thinks the words \\"oh my\\" a lot, which I can never say in my head without using George Takei's voice (which, incidentally, was the most entertaining part of the novel).  Oh myyyyy!<br /><br />Bottom line, I do not recommend this book.  Yuck.h I can never say in my head without using George Takei's voice (which, incidentally, was the most entertaining part of the novel).

0307592731|5.0|The book is ostensibly about a 1,100 mile journey hiking the Pacific Crest Trail from California to Washington State.  This book is really about the inner journey of someone who has lost all.  But the outer  journey may be necessary to evoke the inne, and so begins the trek.<br /><br />Having lost her Mother and also her husband (divorce) with nothing more to lose, the author makes the impulsive decision to hike the trail alone, having had no experience as a long-distance hiker.<br /><br />Her escapades involve drugs, infidelity and promiscuity. She is \\"mixed-up\\" but she has the guts to look it squarely in the face.  Honest, honest, honest.  She is fiercely honest.  Her descriptions of how heroin feels was riveting.  Her life is messy but she bravely plows on through it, and her book gives one an odd permission to be \\"in the mess\\" and be brave.<br />She becomes strong, faces down bears and lecherous men.  And she faces herself, honestly, a feat few accomplish.<br />I loved this book.

0375869026|5.0|Wonder by R.J. Palacio was one of the best books I have ever read. I instantly liked the main character, Auggie, and my heart went out to him. Getting to know him was fun because he is just like a lot of kids I know and I love his sense of humor. Auggie's story made me think about how the students at my school would treat someone who looked so different from everyone else. The book was broken into sections and we got to learn about Auggie's fifth grade experience through the eyes of some of the other characters. At first I thought I wouldn't like this, but it actually turned out to be quite fascinating. I liked the change in perspective and it really made me think about how everyone close to him felt. If the author had only told the story from Auggie's point of view then I really wouldn't have been able to see the whole picture. I think anyone from 4th grade and up should read this remarkable book. If everyone read it they would know how important it is to be kinder than necessary. I know, if starting today, we were all a little kinder- the world would be a better place for everyone. When you read this book you will laugh out loud and you will cry. You will discover what it means to be a better person and you will find out some universal truths. You will learn how to deal with the mean people you encounter. One thing is for sure- you will not be the same person when you get to the end of the book.  You will be better!

It is fun, well-acted, and well-made.  Can't wait to see it again.
B005NGKMOU|5.0|I just finished watching this movie on Netflix, and liked it so much that I am going to purchase it.  I hadn't heard of it, but when I saw it starred Sam Shepherd, I decided to watch it.  I thoroughly enjoyed it--the music was very suited to the story, and the cinematography was fantastic.  Having traveled extensively in Bolivia, I recognized the area. One other reviewer felt the colors were bland and lacking in saturation.  I didn't feel that way, as that is how the terrain looks at that altitude.  (Over 10,000 feet above sea level: the air is quite thin) Sam Shepherd is a very talented actor, writer, and, as this film shows, also a good musician.  I love it when folklore gets a new twist.  Give it a try--
0446572993|5.0|Having read all of his latest books, Baldacci absolutely left me exhausted with \\"The Innocent\\". It gradually builds until the wave crushes you with a plot that is extremely involved and it is absolutely impossible to put down! I strongly recommend this as a vacation or at least, a weekend read...otherwise you'll lose too much sleep seeking the next exiting part of this adventure.<br /> Buy it in hardback, don't wait. Whew!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is now one of my favorite books because I love the story, the characters, writing style, and most of all the imagery.  If you want to tickle your imagination and wonder with beautiful descriptions of magic made manifest, this is a must read.

B0086900TI|5.0|\\"Some of us believe we can make a difference, then we wake up and realize we failed.\\" Henry Barthes (Brody) is a substitute teacher who is all but dead inside. His grandfather is in a nursing home and close to death. He has no other family and the only job he can get is substitute teaching. After taking a position at a severely under preforming school he does everything he can to make a difference. Finding a way to connect to the kids is not only what they need, but also a way for him to find out who he is. There have been a ton of movies about a teacher who comes in to try and \\"fix\\" the students. Even including the true stories \\"Dangerous Minds\\" and \\"Lean On Me\\" this is easily the most realistic portrayal of a teacher trying to help I have ever seen. Not wanting to give anything away it's not a movie where he comes in and starts to rap and all of a sudden everyone gets A's, nor is it him coming in and being a hard ass until everyone \\"gets it\\". This is what most teachers would try and do I think and I didn't think it was possible but this movie give me more respect for what they go through on a day to day basis, most of which is unnoticed or unappreciated. This is a movie that you just need to see, and every high school kid who thinks he is a \\"thug\\" needs to see and understand. As well as parents who seem to not care about their kids education. Another movie that deserves to be noticed and seen by a bigger audience then it will get. I highly recommend this movie. I give this an A+.

B004Y1USJE|1.0|If you ever wondered what YES would sound like if they were The Carpenters, this is it. Seriously. If you listen to Yes for depth, meaning, insight, intense but powerful music and lyrics, run like hell from this one. I do mean RUN.<br /><br />I do not believe that the classic line-up is the one and only Yes, but this album is completely \\"Buggle\\"d up. Apparently a \\"theme\\" is when one plays the same thing over and over on several tracks. \\"Let's fly away from here\\" is the most intelligent set of lyrics on the album. How original and deep. Cliches abound. Actually, that's all there is, lyrically and musically.<br /><br />I bought this CD/DVD combo with all good intentions of listening to it as much as I have most of the previous Yes albums. I have been able to make it through listening to this album twice now, and each time it was a forced issue. I simply cannot listen to it again. I simply CANNOT. I might find one cut or two, maybe, to allow back on my iPhone over time. So far, since purchasing this on the release date, I simply cannot listen to it at all anymore.<br /><br />Yes is one of my favorite bands, when they act and sound like Yes, but this sounds more like the Buggles (and even The Buggles ought to be embarrassed by these lyrics. \\"Video killed the radio stars\\" is a far, far more important phrase than anything on this album. What does that tell you?) Production solely is NOT everything.<br /><br />If you listen to Yes purely for Howe's guitar playing, you'll get a few snippets. Mostly, it is over-produced pablum with lyrics that would have generated a failing grade in high school creative writing class.<br /><br />I find it difficult to believe there is now a YES album I simply cannot listen to, but here it is.<br /><br />I wish all the band members, this version, and the classic incarnations, very well. So well, that they never do something like this to themselves or their audience again.<br /><br />If I wanted this stuff, I could ride an elevator (lift) andlisten to elevator music.<br /><br />I must say I look forward to the return of Jon Anderson to YES now. If ever we took you for granted Jon, this album proves we ought not. I look forward to real songwriting and less sophomoric lyrics on the next YES album. There is an enthusiastic audience for that.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|At the risk of feeding HH's ego with yet another 5 star review, I have to say it's completely justified :) I don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled because this is honestly one of the best books I've ever read.

B004EPYZUS|4.0|I have to say by the time you get to the 4th sequel you have a lot to live up to.  Its 10000x better than MI:2 but that's not hard to do.  I'd have to rank it 3rd compared to the original and the 3rd movie but definitely worth the buy (at amazon's prices) and addition to my collection!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was extremely interesting for me considering I'm not very knowledgeable about any branch of the military.

Plus, the book references a couple of others that sound pretty good and are along the same lines.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|quite a bit of content for a free app, does allow for in app purchases but not required to beat the levels
B005LAIISA|3.0|My son had a good laugh. And to be honest, at places so did I.<br /><br />But...<br />The storyline is not very interesting and the screenplay seems like something done to get the movie out because it was too long since the previous ice-age movie. Dialogues are very average and characters are not as strong as you would see in the other movies in this series.  It starts on a promising note but gets diluted too soon to keep it memorable.<br /><br />A lot of animated features in the last few years (notably Pixar movies and the Ice-age series), have this tendency that a few minutes into the movie, you forget you are watching an animated production.  Continental drift keeps drifting a lot and although is enjoyable and definitely watchable, I would not rate it higher than 3 stars.

B006GHA9QQ|2.0|I remember when I first saw the movie, The Phantom of the Opera, after reading the Leroux novel. I was completely satisfied until the end when The Phantom does not die of heartache like in the novel, but has to suffer the pain of losing Christine. This ending, of course, was one of the reasons Andrew Lloyd Webber decided to make a sequel. When I watched this Love Never Dies movie, I thought that The Phantom and Raoul had totally switched personalities. It was so strange. Nothing was much of a surprise to me until the very ending. Andrew Lloyd Webber made a worst ending than the first. I didn't feel the same message that the original musical was trying to give us. The 2 things I actually enjoyed was the music and the visuals. I don't think this DVD is worth buying. I believe you should rent this movie, if you're dying to see it.

Following the end of &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; you start to create your town. The best part? It's not a money grab. The only things that cost real life currency are things not needed to progress further than a certain point and silly things. Plus, you can even earn good amounts of it in-game! Bravo Gameloft, bravo.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I love the choices in the free version of the app. I am somewhat interested in what the paid app has to offer. The only complaint I have is that the audio clips do not loop well.

0307949508|4.0|After all the hype I figured I'd read 'Tattoo', and I was seriously let down. I nearly didn't read the second book. 'Fire' is quicker paced and has more action. 'Tattoo' is definitely necessary to this series of books, and it is worth spending the time with it to get to know the characters...but those characters don't start to seriously shine until 'Fire'. A good read.
B004ZN9W5M|4.0|It's hard to believe now, given the airplay they received and the records they sold, but Pink Floyd's truly \\"classic\\" period lasted a very short time -- just the seven short years encompassing 1973 through 1979.<br /><br />Before 1973, they had been struggling to redefine themselves in the wake of the drug-fueled mental meltdown of their first singer/guitarist, Syd Barrett. Barrett had written almost all the material on PF's first album, 1967's \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\\" Without him, the Floyd seemed pretty lost, even with the addition of guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour, who was (arguably) Barrett's equal as a singer and certainly his superior as a guitar player.<br /><br />From Barrett's departure until 1973, Pink Floyd slogged through some very mediocre albums (\\"More,\\" \\"Atom Heart Mother\\"), approached coherence on \\"Ummagumma,\\" and produced two fine records indeed, 1971's \\"Meddle\\" and 1972's \\"Obscured by Clouds.\\"<br /><br />With \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" though, the Floyd was reborn. Bassist Roger Waters took over all the lyric writing, while Gilmour, keyboardist Rick Wright and drummer Nick Mason continued to contribute to composing the music. The combination of Waters' penetrating lyrics and the band's tuneful songs was a sure winner.<br /><br />And so PF's classic period began. It continued in 1975 with \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and, to a somewhat lesser extent, with \\"Animals\\" in 1977.<br /><br />I remember exactly where I was in 1979 when I first heard \\"The Wall\\" in its entirety. I had bought the album Friday, Nov. 30, the day it came out, and brought it to my cousins' house. Several of us played pool while my younger cousin sat on an ottoman, reading the lyric sheets to himself and making occasional comments such as, \\"You're gonna love this next line.\\"<br /><br />And we did love it -- from that first listen, we all knew the Floyd had produced another classic. And it was a classic despite being radically different from its recent predecessors. Both \\"Animals\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" had featured some very long songs. \\"The Wall\\" went the other way, with lots of short, to-the-point pieces. There were no epics, such as the 17-minute \\"Dogs\\" from \\"Animals.\\"<br /><br />Over the years, though, \\"The Wall\\" hasn't worn quite as well as it should have. To be honest, there were some songs on it that seemed kind of throwaway -- \\"Vera,\\" \\"Waiting for the Worms,\\" to name two. And Waters had taken over most of the lead vocals, despite having developed a delivery that was becoming ever more strident, brittle and histrionic.<br /><br />Fortunately, the great songs far outweighed the bad. \\"Another Brick in the Wall Part 2,\\" \\"Mother,\\" \\"Young Lust, \\"Hey You,\\" \\"Nobody Home\\" and especially \\"Comfortably Numb\\" were all stupendous.<br /><br />Too bad tensions were tearing the band apart. Before the album was mixed and released, Waters demanded Wright be fired. He was, but the remaining trio of Gilmour, Mason and Waters would make just one album together, 1983's \\"The Final Cut,\\" and many listeners felt it was more like a Roger Waters solo album than a PF album. Waters then quit, and Mason and Gilmour asked Wright to return for the last two Floyd studio albums, \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" and \\"The Division Bell.\\"<br /><br />Parts of \\"Final Cut\\" and \\"Lapse\\" were downright cringe-worthy. \\"Division Bell,\\" the band's very last studio record, was much better, giving the band a fitting farewell.<br /><br />But it's \\"The Wall\\" that stands as the last truly great Pink Floyd album.

B005S9EJ46|5.0|I saw a few ads for this while watching Downton Abbey, (and if you do watch it who can resist Maggie Smith!) I am in my  mid 40s and I went on a weekday afternoon and the theater was packed!! I also noticed I was probably the youngest person there. (I have to admit I noticed as looking around NOT a SINGLE person in the theater wast texting or on the phone, but talking to each other.. HOW NOVEL!) LOL.<br /><br />The movie is wonderful and a true delight, I loved everything about it. So much better then the crude trash they put out today and call it comedy! It was sad it had a limited release. It had depth, substance, a story line and good writing let alone acting by a fantastic cast!<br /><br />Nothing exploded, no big effects, no harsh langauge every five seconds or crude bathroom or sex jokes, just a great movie like they USED To make.  If you love a well done film this is it! It will make you happy, sad, laugh , tear up and remember it LONG after it has ended. Put this on your MUST SEE list!
B002SRQ214|5.0|I ordered this CPU along with other components to rebuild my ASUS CM 1630-06. Once it was installed I booted up and noticed the tempuratures were higher than I liked. A 60 mm fan attached to a quad core heatsink didn't sit right with me. I replaced the heatsink with an Athlon 2 X2 heatsink I got off the old CPU which had a 4500 RPM 80mm Delta PWM fan attached. Problem solved. The chip works wonderfully just it needs a heatsink with a slightly bigger fan. I won't knock off stars just because of the heatsink. This review is for the CPU chip itself after all.

B005LAIH54|2.0|This is not just a bad film, it is an awful film.  Beyond CGI and spectacular action, there is nothing behind it of interest.  There are many reasons for this.<br /><br />First, for anyone who knows mythology, it simply ignores what is known as the most basic stories.  Perseus was one of the earliest heroes, and because of his abilities was seen as a direct challenge to the Gods, but they all survived for later adventures, in particular for the Iliad and Odyssey, but everything else that followed.  Yet here, you have the gods dying off!  Moreover, the plot of Cronus emerging is also essentially made up.  Now, a hollywood version doesn't need to precisely follow known mythology to forge a good plot, but this is so far off that they shouldn't use the names of the Greek Gods at all.  (This was extremely disappointing to me as an amateur classicist, but it will not disappoint just pedants - it is bad for kids interested in mythology.)<br /><br />Second, the characters remain almost completely undeveloped.  Perseus is a kind of automaton, a superhero who miraculously recovers from wounds, etc.  Sure, he has doubts about supporting the gods, but that is superficial.  The worst failing is with the Gods.  In mythology, they have extremely complex and multi-layered personalities, a delight to watch in a parallel story as the human drama unfolds.  But in this film, they are 2-dimensional and their actions and motives hardly make any sense.  This is a missed opportunity for storytelling.<br /><br />Third, the film completely fails to present a coherent picture of the powers of the Gods, which have distinct limits in mythology, instead presenting them as mysteriously omnipotent and then vulnerable.  Why are the monsters there, what can they do or not do, and how do they fit into the story?  None of these questions are addressed implicitly, which you would expect from a subtle script.  As such, it makes little sense and is another missed opportunity.<br /><br />The only thing I can conclude is that the producers were disinterested and just wanted to make a glitzy action film that would rely on star power to sell it.  The result is that it comes off as a crassly commercial product that utterly ignores the literary tradition on which it is based.  This stand in stark contrast to the excellent productions of Ray Harryhausen, who succeeded in creating mythology films that were more or less respected the tradition while being great action films as well.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this to anyone who expects more than mindless action.  Even the wonderful actors are wasted in this.can conclude is that the producers were disinterested and just wanted to make a glitzy action film that would rely on star power to sell it.

034580404X|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is not my typical type of book that I read, but after all the hype on the radio, television, and many other forms of media, I caved. The book is every woman's secret fantasy - a man whose unconditional love is taken a little to far at some points but just right at other times. The book had way too much sexual content, and I am not a conservative person when it comes to this stuff. By Book 3, I was actually skipping the sexual parts because I wanted more of the story line.<br /><br />The three books held my interest until the end of Book 3. I thought it was a fairly weak ending. With all of the action throughout the rest of the books, the ending of Book 3 seemed rather mundane.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I finished this book in 3 days and I enjoyed the story but after so much back and forth between the main characters it became annoying.  I notice some errors but they weren't bad, and after the first half of the book with Travis saying pigeon it made me cringe with annoyance!  Epilogue should have been much better with explaining what happened to the characters instead of focusing on one thing!

B006LSZECO|5.0|Great quick read. I really enjoyed the two points of view. I wish the ending told you just a little more.

B00006WUWN|2.0|I finally reviewed both Austin Powers movies & those 2 movies are full of laughs start to finish especially the 2nd movie they have so many rememberable scenes that are funny. I saw the 2nd movie twice in theaters in 1999. I mean I could go on & on about how great the 2nd movie is. Austin Powers Gold Member isn't I may have gotten a few grins & a few chuckles out of it but their is a lot of bordem in this movie & a lot of humor that doesn't work & when you have a comedy or a parody movie that isn't funny it fails. So I am going to rant some & this is the 1st rant of my 02 & 20 years ago reviews. So you know if you like this film that's cool my dislike is against this movie not any fans of this installment cause every movie has a hater & a fan. Jay Roach returned to direct & this is a step down from part 2. Mike Myers comes back as Austin Powers, Dr Evil, Far B@  s  +  ar  d & he added a new character Gold Member. Also stars Seth Green returns as Scott Evil, Michael Caine as Nigel Powers, Verne Troyer as Mini Me & Beyonce Knowles as Foxxy Cleopatra. The story is you start off with this movie being directed by Steven Speilburg Tom Cruise is playing Austin Powers, Kevin Spacy is playing Dr Evil & Danny DeVito as Mini Me. The opening features Britney Spears who turns out to be a Fembot. Cool opening the rest of the movie however is half<br />a  s  s  ed. You get to Dr Evil who has a new headquarters under The Hollywood sign. Dr Evil is going back to 1975 & bring back Gold Member who developed Cold Fusion so he can pull a metor into The Polar Ice Caps & flood The Earth he calls the plan Preperation H which yeah I did chuckle at that. Unfortantly for Dr Evil Austin Powers & some agents come in & arrest him & Mini Me. Austin is Knighted by The Queen his Dad wasn't there & the people in attendnce laugh at him. I was thinking is this a comedy or is it trying to be dramatic. Austin finds out that his Dad has went missing he questions Dr Evil about it & they Parody Silence OfThe Lambs I liked that. Frau vists him in prison she tells him Scott has taken over the Family Business.  Austin has to go back to 1975 then we are introduced to Foxxy Cleopatra who is undercover going aftert Gold Member & she happend to be 1 of Austin's Girlfriends. She tells him where his Dad is at. Then you have Gold Member who takes his Dad I just didn't find this charter funny at all. Gold Member takes his Austin's Dad through time to 2002 so Austin takes Foxxy with him. You have Dr Evil convince the prisoners to help him escape & you have sing Hard Knock Life it's not funny like in part 2 where he's singing Just The 2 Of Us or What If G  od Was One Of Us. Anyway they escape & then you have Austin & Foxxy go to Japan & FB has became a Sumo Wrester I mean it's a real forgetable scene. You have a really dumb scene Michael Caine wants to see Mini Me's junk another bit of humor that I didn't laugh at I was just indifferent about it I was like whatever. I can say that 1 of the scenes that I laughed at was when Austin & Foxxy were going through this building is when Austin is hiding from the security. He finds his father where they try & chase after Gold Member he gets away Austin & Nigel blame each other & they go their seperate ways. Scott who is now going bald joins his Father & he got him sharks with laser beams. Scott becomes Dr Evil's favorite Son & Mini Me is kicked to the curb so to speak. He becomes a good guy when Austin gets to his room he loses it & beats him up that's only the 2nd time where I busted out laughing mainly cause it showed a flashback from the last movie. Austin is told by an inside man in Dr Evil's organization that he has derected so Mini Me helps them. Austin's car becomes a sub & they get on board Dr Evil's sub. Austin & Foxxy split up & then they really tried to recreate the tent scene from the last movie it just wasn't as funny I did get a bit of grin out of it. Austin & Mini Me are caught Austin throws Mini Me down a vent where he escapes. Austin is taken to the control room where Dr Evil is ready to launch Prep H. However Foxxy has the key. She frees Austin & he's ready to shoot Dr Evil then from out of no where Nigel comes in & he reveals that Dr Evil is his Brother. Scott runs off he wants revenge. Gold Memer is going to finish the job Foxxy tries to stop him but she is taken at gun point Austin & Dr Evil work together to reverse the polarity & the metor is destroyed. I'm sorry if I did a poor job explaining the plot but this is a poor sequel it felt like they tried to add dramatic elements or some kind of message & that usually hurts a comedy especially when it's a sequel to 2 really funny movies. The humor didn't work this time there were way too many cameos & it's forgettable. Jay Roach I mean I don't know what went wrong cause it's the same director of the 1st 2 movies. Mike Myers was sort of funny as Dr Evil & FB but The Austin Powers character wasn't & The Gold Member character was lame. Maybe that was a problem playing 4 characters. Beyonce I thought did fine. Michael Caine did his best. Seth Green is fine as the smart alec but he's not funny as a villain. Verne Troyer was good again. I know there are talks of an Austin Powers 4 & Mike Myers is all for it which I wouldn't mind a 4th movies as long as it goes back & has humor that works.That goes for the crude humor & is an actual comedy  So next will be my last review in this series for The Month Of July 20 years ago Buffy The Vampire Slayer.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a very good city simulator game. You need to manage your resources to build the buildings that will get people that live in your city to be happy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun with a twist. would recommend<br />my kids love to play this game. hours if fun. lots to do. fun fun fun.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|This game is too hard!It is fun to play and I learned a little bit , but the computer can easily beat me on medium difficulty.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a very fun game. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Where's My Water? and Phineas and Ferb!!
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I work with glass and have used a wet saw to cut but the blades are too thin and don't last. I thought I would try this bottle cutter but it barely scores the glass and having to hassle with a candle or hot water and then ice cold water just doesn't work well. The rod that comes to tap the score has only spread cracks throughout the bottle and the hot/cold process really doesn't work. It is awkward to hold and use. Am not happy I wasted my money.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|put more stuff in it to make more of a challenge I'm out of word to write so hi bye boo
0345803507|5.0|This series is the best book for adult women to read. Great love story! I would reccomend this book to others.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is off the hook and I love it Lik it was my own child also all these games in one app plus 25 is awesome :-*
0446572764|5.0|A recommened read by by brother, I could not put the book down once I started reading it. The gripping story set late in Stalin's reign at times is painful to read. The terror, starvation, and desperation felt by the citizens of Soviet Russia are captured so viscerally it will leave you haunted. Kudos to Tom Rob Smith on his debut novel. The Secret Speech and Agent 6 are on my nightstand and I'm all set to catch up w/Leo and Raisa's continuing tale of enlightenment.
006112429X|1.0|I bought this book brand new, to my dismay when I received the book, there was no protection around the book, mainly there was no plastic protection wrapped around the book to keep the pages from getting bent in shipping.  The package was sent in a padded yellow envelope that was obviously just thrown around and the first 1/3 of the book was bent because there was no protection for the book.<br /><br />The book is great but I will never buy from this seller again because they obviously don't know how to ship a \\"PAPERBACK\\" book.<br /><br />I am an Amazon Prime member and would have hopes that my paid membership would be able to keep sellers from doing this.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Truly enjoyed the first season on Game of Thrones, as it is all what you wish for. History, Emotions, War, Faith and Pride all comes nicely together. Can't wait for the second season to come out
0345803485|5.0|Shipped very fast! The book is absolutely amazing! I hate reading. But this one definitely caught my attention. Its not the type of book a man would like to read. And not a book for a kid/ young teenager. Very vulgar, but its got a great story line.
B008N1V11U|5.0|looks cool but just too expensive if it was less expensive I'd. buy it in the wink of an eye looks cool
B0063IH60K|5.0|like the visual.  its clear and easy to play.  some card games are just too loopy.  this game is for everyone.
B00881VLCE|5.0|very pretty pictures to put together. Additional puzzle sets to purchase very inexpensive. Whatever problems there may have been do not seem to be on my Kindle Fire. I find these puzzles to be very entertaining and fun.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is such a good story. I've read it 10times now and i still can't get over it. I can't wait for the second one.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I really like this app my opinion -get its free!!!!!! Plus  when they say it is HD... it is.  once again get it is free
6305076626|5.0|Sorry for all the mix up.  I don't know why it was listed under posters but oh, well.  Thx anyway.
B005LAII08|4.0|I really like Brave, I really do, but this review is just going to come out sounding very negative, even though on it's own, Brave is a very good movie.<br /><br />The story was good, but it seemed to be a story that's been done before. Kind of like Brother Bear, except with a mother-daughter relationship instead of a pair of brothers.<br /><br />The characters in this movie, were, to me, pretty unlovable. Merida herself I found to be very immature at times. I know this is a coming of age story, but she seemed to just be extraordinarly whiny at times. I did enjoy her brother's antics, they were probably the high point of the movie for me.<br /><br />The music was good, though not very memorable.<br /><br />The animation was beautiful!<br /><br />Overall it was a good movie, it just doesn't compare to Toy Story and Up as far as leaving an impression and being really remarkable goes. And as the first Pixar movie aimed at a female audience, I'd had really high hopes for it.
0345803485|1.0|A story about two emotionally immature asthmatics (they are always gasping and their breath hitches more than it should) who have terribly boring sex a lot. Predictable and poorly written, the only reason this book is entertaining is because it's so easy to make fun of it. I read some of it out loud to my husband, not for sexy time, but laughs.<br /><br />I can't believe women find this book hot and romantic. It's romantic like a restraining order is romantic... I can't believe I paid money for this book. I think E.L. James should give me money back along with compensation for the time I spent reading it that I will never, ever get back.
0375507256|5.0|David Mitchell has been described as a literary ventriloquist . . . able to create multifarious styles.  In no other book is this description of him more apparent than Cloud Atlas.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is atypical: five 'half' stories at the front of the book, and a sixth 'mirror' story in the middle that leads the reader to the conclusion of the first five narratives. Each chapter is connected in some way to the chapter before and after it.  And metaphorically the connections are mostly about human progress, which some might see as deterioration.  Mitchell has described the theme of the book as 'predacity . . . individuals prey on individuals, groups on groups, nations on nations.'<br /><br />I think offering an overview of the plots of each story conflicting because the best part about this novel is discovery and surprise.  If you like a wide variety of literature, then I think, like me, you'll find the combination of the novel's structure and different literary styles pure art.  From comedy to mystery to dystopian, Cloud Atlas offers readers an epic journey through the history and future of human progress, one story at a time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its realllllllly cool and stuff me and my bff liv it so much. we play it all the time like everywhere. its so convienient
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I purchased this because everyone was talking about it. I put it on my Driod phone to read when I was on the treadmill at the gym. I didn't want to waste time on this if it was as bad as I've been told.<br /><br />I can't get past the writer's lack of skills. Reading it was visually upsetting. I ended up buying it in audio form. I thought that maybe it would be less offensive if in the spoken word. The content was not all that inspiring, either. My answer to the content was, Yeah and so...what's so cool about this? In truth I found it dull.<br /><br />Maybe had there been better grammar and literary skills involved I might find the book more compelling. I was too distracted by the thought that this is a best seller and it's written thusly.<br /><br />Also, to be fair, I prefer none fiction, documentaries and science. I rarely read fiction.<br /><br />I guess I could say if one can get past writing skills and one has a limited sexual imagination, this book might be more acceptable.<br /><br />One of my friends told me that she finds it similar to reading Danielle Steel romances. She said the benefit of books like these are mindless, provides an escape and you don't have to think.  It was only then that I understood people finding this book interesting. All of those points are true. If this is the threshold of said book, then it accomplishes those things.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|These books are the best that I have read since Twilight.  Normally, I am not a romance reader, but these books sucked me in from the beginning!  I would recommend these books to everyone that has not read them.
B007SGM084|5.0|Books were well written and extememly interesting.  I had a hard time putting them down.<br />I thought the last book was the best.  Would love to read some more books by this author.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|I don't see where all of the negativity about this product is coming from. Just took it out of the package, and within half an hour I got a wine bottle and a few beer bottles with some nice flat cuts.<br />The product does what it is supposed to, gives you a way to make a continuous circular cut on a bottle. A glass cutter is a glass cutter; I'm sure there are some fancy blades out there that make neater scores, but it does the same crap.<br />If there's a problem with the separation stage, it's probably because of the method of separation or how the bottle was scored. Just be sure not to go over a score line more than once, don't change how much pressure you apply, make it a firm cut (not so much that you're forcing it), and maybe find a more mild separation technique. I personally use a candle and ice or steady stream of water.
B008MEM24S|5.0|similar to where's my water. numerous levels that start out easy and increase in difficulty as you progress. well worth the price.
B00006IX0R|5.0|Well maybe. But this album contains some gems, that is for certain.<br /><br />Watch out there are at least a few points in the album where the lilting tones of Dolores Mary Eileen O'Riordan will cause you to have to quash down a compulsion to book the first flight to Limerick. Some of the melodies are  entrancing - the open bars of Linger are divine.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I like this app because it is very helpful for super long math problems lots of the time I don't feel like working out problems so I use this app
B0055SWM08|4.0|I like this game. It's not so hard that I want to throw my device out the window, nor is it so easy that I'm bored after five minutes.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking to kill time.  I also like the music; it's pretty soothing.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|If you have a family member or friend who is dealing with Alzheimer's, this is a great book to read.  It is written from the view of the woman with Alzheimer's, so when she gets confused, you really feel what she is going through.  I am a hospice volunteer, working with patients with dementia and Alzheimer's, and this book gave me some wonderful insight into what the patients may be going through.
0345803485|2.0|I figured I would give the book series a shot after so many people on facebook made such a big deal about it. I was even mildly curious that it was an erotica because I usually don't read books with that sort of subject matter and it was hitting the best sellers list. Well I just finished the third book today because I thought after the first two books I might as well see how it ends. The trilogy was disappointing to say the least. Its so predictable how it will end, the sex scenes suck and are comical...and there is so much repeating! It was exhausting to read and I actually towards the end was counting down the pages until it was over so I could be done with it.<br /><br />The author had nice vision and I understand she was trying to create something different than people are used to reading, but I feel the book series still needs a lot of editing before it could be considered something worth publishing. I can't believe its going to be a movie...
B005HSL626|5.0|My son loves this game and he said to get around ads just turn off wifi. He said he found no problems  exept that it crashed once, still, he says it's a great game
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great puzzle game. Quite addictive and lots of variety. Great challenging puzzle game. I highly recommend for a challenge or a simple time killer. Gets more challenging as you go.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm a fan of puzzle games that can hold my attention for a while and this one that works. Honestly its a great game app and I recomend to anyone looking for another game worth having.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game so much! I downloaded it thinking it was gonna be stupid but I said, &quot; what the heck? &quot; and bought it. I told myself I would only try it out but I ended up staying up and playing till 5am!
B00884GR0W|1.0|I just want to say It ducks cause Its a ripoff heroin of minecraft!!! they should have pocket edicion of mincraft
B008K8H9C6|5.0|If the biggest complaint about this game is that is like another game, you have nothing to worry about! Great graphics, great game play, and easy to get lost in!
B004T32SOK|5.0|I tried this cloud storage after I tried dropbox first and hands down. If you can use a place that gives you free 50 gig account and a pretty descent amount of options to do with your music ,movies,or even programs whatever you would like to do with the space as you please gives you the option to share and even gives you a link in which you can share with others..
030788743X|5.0|This is another one of those books that Bree over at 1 Girl 2 Many Books told me to read.  She's so bad about making me buy books... but I can't NOT, because they're always SO GOOD!<br /><br />I was born in the 80s. Early 80s. (Yeah, I'm old...*sob*) So, 80s and 90s trivia about video games and music and all that good stuff makes my heart go pitter-pat.  It also amuses me to remember the stuff from back then.  That, of course, helped me fall in love with this book; it is FULL of references to 80s and 90s pop culture and lifestyle.<br /><br />Now, that said, you don't -have- to know all about all that stuff to get this book and enjoy it.  The story itself is beautifully crafted and the characters are well rounded and deep individuals who make you love them or hate them.  There's enough explanation that even the folks who have absolutely no idea about PacMan and Asteroids and Cyndi Lauper will be able to easily follow along. (But how can you NOT know about these rings?!) Anyway... If you are a child of the 80s, read this book STAT.  I have made all my geeky gamer friends grab it and every single one has loved it.  I've also made some of my non-geeky non-gamer friends read it and they've adored it, as well. See? It's almost one-size-fits-all!<br /><br />Back on point - the writing is crisp and clean, the characters develop decently, the plot is fantastic, and the world is believable in a totally apocalyptic-ish kind of way.<br /><br />Get it. Read it. Hug it. Love it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I'm so glad I got this game for my kindle fire. It's fun &amp; addictive. Not happy with the pop-ups..but its a free game so have to deal with it. Love the hints...
B006ON41FC|5.0|OMG!! I got it on a day when it was free(kindle fire) and I'm glad I did!! love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  y'all should get it seriously
0345803485|1.0|This was by far the worst book I have ever read. My mother-in-law started reading and was so excited about it so I asked if I could borrow it on my kindle. I only made it halfway through when I had to stop. It's like it was written by a teenager or something. I couldn't imagine how my mother-in-law read all three of them. I did notice a pattern though, most of the people who liked the books don't usually read, and the people who do read realize how horrible it is.
1416909532|5.0|The authors cleared up many areas that confused me and gave a good kick in the butt when I needed it! Greg is constantly reaffirming how special we women all are and Liz presents our side to his aruguments, \\"Yeah, but....\\" In the end, Greg is always right. The book is witty, insightful and LIFE CHANGING! I checked it out at the library but I am on here today to buy my own copy!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great ending to the trilogy, this author weaves a great love story! I hope there's a sequel. The characters come alive in the pages, by the end you feel as if you know them!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I enjoy this, challenging with many levels of difficulty it's a little addicting but worth the time. Constant updates adding new levels
030758836X|5.0|Loved this book. Lots of twists and turns that left you speculating as to what the heck was really going on. Loved it from beginning to end.
B0086700CM|4.0|Its ok but when u get to 1500 or something it gets hard and then when I keep trying and trying it gets hard.Finally I give up and I don't wanna play.So I wish they can put the speed down by making it go up just 100
B004UQPM4E|5.0|I'd been debating on getting this set since it's release last year, simply because (let's be honest)Superman III, IV were incredibly sub par and \\"Returns\\" was one of the most frustrating film going experiences of my 43 years on this Earth.<br /><br />That said, I think the first Superman film is the archetype by which all other superhero films are judged (see my review). When Donner was allowed to make his cut of the second film, I was estatic and as much as I loved the Lester film as a kid (I didn't care about directors back then), Donner's cut makes much more sense and has a tone more in line with the first film.<br /><br />All in all...the big selling point here was the special features. There are LOTS AND LOTS of those and shows a lot of footage unseen in the previous DVD releases.<br /><br />While \\"Returns\\" was such a let down to me....I think enough time has passed for me to give it a shot and take it for what it is, a tip of the hat to Donner's film, if not a complete rip-off with incredibly bad decisions regarding sub plots (the whole stalking Lois and illegitimate kid parts in particular). However, Routh had an earnest way about him that was very reminiscent of Reeve and was the best thing about that film. On the other hand, I could go on and on as to why Kate Bosworth was an INCREDIBLY bad casting choice.<br /><br />As far as the third and fourth Reeve films go, I'll just say that even though III was painful but watchable, 1987's Superman IV was so incredibly bad that it makes Schumacher's Batman And Robin look like THE DARK KNIGHT....and that is saying A LOT. If nothing else, I'll watch it with my teenage son and just rip into it \\"Mystery Science Theater\\" style. That's always fun.<br /><br />To sum up. Even though it's price fluctuates up and down and still hovers in the $70-$80 range, it's a great set and has very cool packaging. As a fan, I'm glad I finally pulled the trigger and think I'm going to get a lot of viewing pleasure from it.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I absolutely adore this show. I love the dry humor in it and I can't believe I never watched it when it was on TV. The cast is awesome and I love how they consider themselves an ensemble rather than there being one star of the entire show. The best thing about it is that many of the situations are realistic and stemmed from real life incidents of the producers, writers, etc. It has moved up to one of my favorite shows and of course Phil and Cam are my favorite characters. As soon as I started watching it I immediately ordered the second season because I flew through the episodes so quickly. I think the script is brilliant and the actors ability to use their facial expressions and innuendos really make this show something special. Though there may be some sexual references, it's done in a way where it's not uncomfortable and younger children probably wouldn't get it anyway so there's no problem watching it with the whole family like I do. I will definitely purchase the rest of the DVDs as they come out, it is totally worth it.
B004UIOUHC|1.0|Android Toshiba Thrive hates it. Opera simply closes and disappears when it wants. Never worked correctly even with reinstall.  Went to Dolphin instead. No problem with it.
B001E45XT4|5.0|These were given as a gift, but have been told their review of this product. This headset has great sound quality. It has a really comfortable fit. The microphone is positioned perfectly. Decent price for a headset made this well. And as headsets go....very durable.
0230754686|3.0|This book is one of very few to document the modern DPRK death camps, and even rarer, an escapee from the harshest \\"camp 14\\". Its an intriguing and remarkable story.<br /><br />However to me it lacks the style and finesse of \\"Nothing to Envy\\" or \\"The aquariums of Pyongyang\\". It presents more like a long documentary, switching back and forth between commentary and news report.<br /><br />It also touches on the general intransigence and lack of concern for ROK refugees, (or in fact anything beyond their borders) in materialistic ROK.<br /><br />It is an international shame that such concentration camps continue to exist and be tolerated in the 21st century. Sadly North Korea has proven extremely difficult to influence, due to its isolationist culture and geopolitical location.<br /><br />In 2013 Shin Dong Hyuk slammed South korea for turning a blind eye to the situation in the north:<br /><br />\\"At a launch event for the local version of the book on Thursday in Seoul, Mr. Shin had strong words for some South Koreans' indifference toward human rights violations inside the North.<br /><br />He argued that South Korea should be put on trial next to the North Korean regime for turning a blind eye, should the International Criminal Court decide to preside over the case.\\"<br /><br />http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2013/05/02/north-korea-prison-escapee-slams-indifference/
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|i loved this book. from the 1st chapter on you will be hooked. it it a true page turner. from the pictures to the spooky writting, this book is wonderful.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I would definitely give this 5 stars but I cant b/c it is really awesome and fun and free but it keeps giving the same puzzles! its so addictive for a while but then u start to realize they r not hard and don't challenge your mind at all! there are only a few that took me more than a few seconds to figure out. I love it but after a while its the same.......but I do recommend it but do notify that it will only be fun for a few weeks
B002SEW5WW|5.0|When I first stumbled onto One Republic with \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" I was so excited. I didn't have long to wait for their next album \\"Waking Up.\\" Not sure what all the \\"nah-sayers\\" are talking about. This album was great from beginning to end. Although, I do agree that \\"Lullaby\\" is a bit slow and doesn't seem a perfect fit for the album. But I love One Republic and all the talent they infuse into their music. The messages in their lyrics are inspiring, and I love that my tween wants to listen to their music just as much as I do. I am definitely looking forward to their next album! (Even though it was just one word, I do hope they resist the urge to put profanity into their next album.)
B005NPLXJ4|2.0|When I first heard the idea of Metallica going to work on an album with the likes of Lou Reed, my interest was piqued. I mean, what could be more fascinating? Two very different artists, collaborating on a concept album. And I have to admit, the concept itself and the name/album art all work very well. If I saw this on a shelf, I would probably pick it up and give it a listen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the finished product (can I even call it finished?) is not worth the time and effort they obviously sank into it.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, James' vocals are typical, Lou's sound (for lack of a better word) like an old frog croaking, and the music is a hodgepodge of two styles that were clumsily thrown together. Their respective styles could have worked if only they had taken more time to meld them. And the vocals/lyrics would have been improved (in my opinion) had James done all the vocals and stretched his voice back to the menacing lullaby days of \\"Unforgiven\\". That would have been more appropriate.<br /><br />I was expecting Lou as collaborator, to only be working behind the scenes: arranging the music and crafting the songs. Basically giving the album his \\"touch\\".<br /><br />Instead, we get an album over produced and saturated with Lou (even when we don't want him), with Metallica swinging their sticks and axe's in the background. I can almost imagine them feeling very relegated when all is said and done; an afterthought to the Reed ego trip that is \\"Lulu\\"<br /><br />I cannot, in good conscience, give this record any recommendation for sale. Listen to samples of the tracks online to form your own feelings but trust me when I say, this very long (very, very long) goulash of sounds are yet another testament to the idea that there are just some musicians who don't belong together.<br /><br />Skip this one and let's hope there isn't a sequel.
031620157X|5.0|I loved this book. My roommate and I got it the same day and read it in one sitting and I have to say, this was a novel that truly let me imagine. My favorite fairy tales just became a lot cooler and the morals that they were supposed to teach me when I was younger, really hit home. It was an interesting homage to Anderson and the Brothers Grimm and I think they would be happy with this work.

B000V86OKG|5.0|What can you say about Dexter? Anyone who has ever watched the show knows you are immediately hooked. I watched from the very first episode. I was curious how it would come out compared to the books. I have to say the writers are beyond awesome! This is one show that I can watch over & over. I love putting in seasons & having a marathon & just watch every episode over & over. This definitely has gotten used...wouldn't hesitate to buy ANY Dexter season...have them all. Sorry to know there is only 2 more seasons coming up and I will make sure to have them too. I have every season. There are only 3 shows that I have every season of...would not be without Dexter ever.....plan on watching these for years to come! Great price, got it on sale which was even better... got love Amazon when they have their sales, you just can't beat them =0)
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|My 9 year old daughter loves legos and I thought this was a wonderfully creative idea - but it was way too complicated for us - too hard to make any of the shapes on the cards in the time limit given and takes much too long to make them without a time limit.  You can modify it, of course, lay the shapes out instead of actually connecting them, but it was too frustrating for the 9 year old and beyond me, as well.  Would probably be great for a smarter family than us and with older kids.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Awesome movie, great cast of characters. Martin Scorsese once again delivers which will always be one of the all time greats! Great twists & turns. Can't say enough about this movie, keeps you watching every second w/ getting bored for a minute. Long movie, but you would never realize it, goes almost too fast!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so amazing. Its interesting and actually holds my attention. I have ADHD and I can focus on this game :-)
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|I hate to write this review now after buying this way back in '08 especially in light of this recent Batman release & what happened. This movie was a great movie. Christian Bale proves once again that he may be the best Batman there is and well I think everyone can agree that the performance by Heath Ledge as the Joker was over the top! What a great loss of talent. I have the first movie in this series Batman Begins also and will buy the new one when that comes out. I have not seen that one yet, but I am sure it promises to live up to its legacy so far. Awesome special effects, overall one of the best Batman movies ever.
0425263908|1.0|I read the Fifty shades trilogy back in January; I can't believe that an author would shamelessly duplicate some of the SAME wording, as Fifty Shades and scenarios. CG is (Christian Grey) GC is (Gideon Cross)..Grey's tie on the cover of Fifty shades, Gideon's cuff links on the cover of this cheap book...come on REALLY???<br /> I took a friends recommendation for this book and will trust my instincts. I'll finish the book, but I will NOT read the other one that releases.<br /><br />This is an embarrassing, cheap copy of the original version. NO ONE can compare to the original couple and I'm so frustrated that this author had no shame no originality.NOT COOL
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a great read, once you start it you'll want to continue until you've finished the book. Just let your mind wonder and enjoy this experience.
B001VIMCW4|2.0|Love Daniel Craig.  Love the modern, more serious Bond.  Hate the ultra fast edits during the action sequences that can't allow the viewer to process the drama.  Booo!!!
B008MEM24S|1.0|it should be free cuz it sucked! !!!!WORST GAME EVER!!!!!! cuz it was just like where's my water!! Disney should totally make it free! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0345803507|5.0|I Really didn't think the series of books would be this GOOD!!  I couldn't put it down, you start readig, you don't want to stop!!
B004JZBGWI|3.0|but there is a negative to request be fixed in the next version and that is that when you push back after editting and saving one copy of a note and had previously exited and returned (and it saves everytime you exit, which is a plus) the app goes to your previous editted copy and if you click back from there it saves the earlier rougher draft! deleting your more recent copy because it thinks you were editing the one your browser like back button scrolling took you through. this is very aggravating and i almost caught myself to not click but...

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Definitely one of my fav games on my kindle fire. It's addicting but refreshingly simple to play. And all you have you basically have do is connect the dots. The only issue I had is that some of the colors look the same. (Yes I'm a little color blind.)
B0014EU5XI|4.0|Awesome set of songs. And only for $2.99! How can you not get this.<br />My only complaint is that it is missing \\"TV Dinners\\" Why was that not included?<br /><br />Oh well, you can't have everything.<br /><br />Great music to drive or work by.<br /><br />thanks Amazon
B004FOA84A|5.0|very fun and addicting!  I have really enjoyed playing this game with my mom. Can't wait for more games like this one to come out.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I stopped using it because of the irrelevant and relentless advertising. It stopped being fun after an update brought even more ads.
B00756GRUE|5.0|This watch has been on my wrist for 6 hours now, so I'll just be writing down my first impressions.<br /><br />First, it's big. Thick, heavy, large face and a sturdy bezel. This is perfect for large-ish wrists, it'll look weird on a smaller person.<br /><br />A lot of people on the interwebs complain about the thin band width. Really, I don't think it's thin at all. Just my opinion.<br /><br />The screw-down crowns are a great touch, you don't have to worry about accidentally messing anything up. Same for the bezel, it's kind of hard to turn so it stays where it is. And with solar power, 200m water resistance and a hard mineral, this watch is not anything you need to worry about. That's really the selling point of this: no fuss diver's watch. You don't have to wind it, it's sturdy enough to be a work watch, and it's got that classic diver's look. That's why I think this watch model (all of the solar chronographs) are bound to be classics - they are built to last, in function and style.<br /><br />Speaking of function, the stopwatch works perfectly. It goes up to 60 minutes, so it's good for cooking or laundry, and it resets easily and doesn't mess up like some automatic chronographs.<br /><br />If I were to complain about this watch, I'd pick out the metal band that it comes with. It's crap, put simply. It's cheap and doesn't fit properly, and it has an unsightly chrome finish. Some people take sandpaper and scratch off the finish, which makes it look better IMO, but the band is still uncomfortable. But, bands can be replaced. I instantly put this watch on a 20mm NATO canvas strap and it's much more comfortable. Looks better, too. So be prepared to shop around for better straps, the one this comes with will be a good backup...I guess.<br /><br />Online pictures really do not do this watch justice. The case looks better than the Seiko Monster and SKX series, I think, and the blue dial version is really sharp looking. And once you have it on your wrist you'll feel howsturdy this thing is, I don't think I'd be able to break it even if I tried. But we shall see - I will be updating this review in a few weeks for a second review.
B007NZDES0|5.0|this is an excellent concert video.  i was also fortunate to attend the concert and it was just like being there again.  also the bonus features are good.  this is a \\"must have\\" for sade fans.  i highly recommend this item.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|I have always loved this movie! I been looking for it in stores with no luck. Finally Monday I ordered it on Amazon, came home today....Wednesday to find it sitting on my steps. I was thrilled at the speedy delivery as always. I watched it with my hubby (one of his favorite movies also)daughter and my two boys. The kids really enjoyed it. Acting was great, the story was so romantic and sad. Whoopi was Hilarious. This movie really made me miss Patrick Swayze a lot more than I already do. I sooo hate he was taken from us so soon, but he leaves a legacy behind.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I pull my Kindle out all day long when we are expecting some type of severe weather.  It is invaluable.  Love it!
034580404X|1.0|The first book I found really disgusting,all it was about sex.  the plot got a little better by the second book<br />and by the third, it had a fairly based reason for the writing.  I do not see what everyone else is so enthralled about.  Course if you are interestly only in sex, guess it fits the bill
B007SGM084|4.0|Several friends have read the books and recommended them. I didn't think I would be into an S&M style book, however once I started reading it became addictive.<br />Book 1 was pretty good, setting most of the background for the main characters, lots and lots and lots of sex, bondage and more sex. The emails were pretty entertaining to read back and forth. I was glad to be done book 1 as it was just a lot to take in with all the sex.<br /><br />Book 2 was so much better! You got more of a story, there wasn't as much sex, but it was still steamy and I found myself laughing at the emails back and forth between Ana and Christian. I feel more of an emotional connection to the Ana and Christian in this book especially during certain parts of the book. I feel like I made it through book 2 much faster than book 1.<br /><br />Book 3 was hands down excellent! I was so sad to finish it. I love how it showed Ana in a more adult role and standing up for herself, also being a protector. It was definitely still as steamy as the second book, I love how it kept some suspense and had some unsuspected turns. The epilogue and extras at the end were great, it tied up the book and gave an insight on how their lives would go. It was great to have the 2 extra sections about Christians first Christmas and his view of first meeting Ana.<br /><br />Overall I think the series was excellent, it was more money than I've spent on a series of books but well worth it. Definitely something I see myself reading again. Cannot wait for the next series to come out by James and the movie based on these novels.
B001EOOQEC|4.0|1992's Dehumanizer was Black Sabbath's sixteenth full-length studio album. It is sort of an anomaly in their career, in as much as that it was their third album with Ronnie James Dio on vocals, who had previously sang on the band's tenth and eleventh albums Heaven And Hell and Mob Rules but left the band to start a successful solo career, to be replaced firstly by Deep Purple's Ian Gillian for one album and then by Deep Purple's Glen Hughes for one album.<br /><br />After the band lost Hughes they then recruited Ray Gillen before finally ending up with Tony Martin who, excluding this album which interrupts the five studio album and almost ten year streak, sang on every Black Sabbath studio album afterwards.<br /><br />As if interrupting the Tony Martin streak didn't already make it feel a little odd, it is also a little odd in that it both is and isn't the band's final album with Ronnie James Dio on vocals because they did actually reform with him again briefly over a decade and a half later to put out three new songs on a greatest hits package and then once more with a different name (Heaven And Hell) and put out another album.<br /><br />The album was produced by Reinhold Mack, who is notable for his work with Queen, ELO and Deep Purple. The production job of the album however is a source of complaint among many fans and critics, who argue that the record is too muddy sounding.<br /><br />The general public and critical consensus surrounding the album was that it was the weakest of the three Black Sabbath albums with Dio, but people can differ on whether that's because this one is actually bad or because the other ones just happen to be even better.<br /><br />How you feel about this subject will just come down to personal preference at the end of the day and you really have to try it for yourself to find out where you stand. The only thing I would say is that the album is a little dense and definitely a grower so if you really want the best out of it you should probably put in at least five or six serious listens before really making a judgment.<br /><br />Musically, the album is very heavy, dark and doom orientated, primarily slow paced and mostly based around longer tracks; if any speed builds up its usually just for the guitar solo or the ending (with a few exceptions of course).<br /><br />Fans of the album would argue that the songs are substantial, and critics of it would argue that the songs are overlong with too much repetition. Its not like the album is devoid of variety though, sometimes there are soft arpeggiated sections and there are a few tasteful touches of background keys, but to be fair it is mostly all about big riffs and Dio's vocals.<br /><br />The tracks are quite powerful, brimming with teasing potential energy, that feels intense because the song feels like it is holding back something and threatening to explode at any moment. It can be frustrating to a lot of listeners that the songs basically overuse this teasing mechanic and rarely actually do explode as promised, but again depending on your viewpoint maybe that just makes it more intense.<br /><br />If you are satisfied hearing some big Iommi riffs, a few guitar solos and Dio's inimitable vocals, then you can't really miss out on this album. It may not rewrite history and replace Paranoid and their debut in every critic's poll and top-100 list, nor should it be expected to, but it is another set of songs to be enjoyed in the form you already enjoy.<br /><br />Stand out tracks include the musically-atypical single `TV Crime' which is a lot faster than the rest of the album, as well as the very heavy `Letters From The Earth' and the grand `I.'<br /><br />Overall; There are certainly a lot of reasons to give this album a listen; if you are a Sabbath fan, if you are a Dio fan, if you enjoyed Heaven And Hell`s album and if you just plain like big doomy riffs and slow songs. I speculate that the album suits metal fans more so than the original rock fans, and that if you enjoy Stoner or Doom metal you'd be more accepting of the album's production and direction.<br /><br />All in all, if you have the time, money and patience for it and suspect you'd be inclined to enjoy it then you should give this album a shot. At the very worst you'll get one or two new enjoyable tracks for your collection, and if you're lucky then maybe you will find something that you really connect with., and that if you enjoy Stoner or Doom metal you'd be more accepting of the album's production and direction.<br /><br />All in all, if you have the time, money and patience for it and suspect you'd be inclined to enjoy it then you should give this album a shot. At the very worst you'll get one or two new enjoyable tracks for your collection, and if you're lucky then maybe you will find something that you really connect with.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Better story and character completion than many books I have paid brick and mortar releases for. While true there are grammatical errors, it is an excellent independent publishing with all that comes with independent publishing.<br /><br />Hope sequek will come out soon
B000092T6M|5.0|This movie is only good in this extended version. Why? Because Alan Sidney Patrick Rickman is made of win. Need I say more?
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Draw Something is a really fun game. Its great for all ages and lets you pick between different difficulties. It makes me sad that I can't  get the update on my kindle fire and I think the color packages and bombs cost too many coins:-( But great game overall!!!!
B007DIQC90|5.0|This CD is very good.  Has a good mix of slow songs and a couple upbeat songs.  I do wish they had more songs with a faster beat.  But overall very glad with it.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|Ira Levin's A Kiss Before Dying is cleverly plotted with enough twists and turns to keep you turning the pages until the very end. A peek inside the mind of a man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Excellent suspense thriller!
B00846REIS|5.0|Number one thing I like about this book id that it teaches you patience and acceptance for your partner. I read this book in two days because it was so good....I recommend it

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Honestly, i had low standards for this book. they say not to judge a book by its cover but lets face it- we all do. I could not help but root for Abby. Her and Travis were simply meant to be together. This story takes place during college for these young students who are just plainly living the \\"college lifestyle\\". i loved the accuracy this author depicted. if your having any doubts about reading this book ... just take it from a stranger you have no trust in and read it!!
0062112430|5.0|Thank you so much for the book.  I'm only halfway through it and I already can't put<br />it down.  Carefully packaged, the book was crisp, clean, no tears, no damage, nothing.<br /><br />Very good seller and very good product

0525423273|5.0|I've read this book many, many times yet I've never reviewed it. I could never find the words to actually sum up how much I loved this book. Recently (like a few days ago) I read Stephanie Perkin's sophomore novel and I thought it would be right for me review this one as well.<br /><br />Anna Oliphant was such an awesome protagonist. I could connect with this girl instantly and her snakiness made me laugh from the very beginning of the book! She wasn't perfect but rather she had flaws that she wasn't afraid to deal with. She did things I would have done and didn't always deal with issues in the best way possible, something a lot of us can compare with! Seeing Paris from her eyes was just so much fun! Anna was also someone I could been myself being friends with and I really, really wanted her to be real!<br /><br />The plot in an essence seems so over done: the whole going to boarding school in another country but not with Stephanie Perkins. She really made Paris and the school and the secondary characters come alive and it really was an original idea. The reason why Anna goes, though, to me was the most perfect because she wasn't a bad kid whose parents thought she needed a life lesson. I love Meredith, Rashmi (yay for diversity!) and Josh...and Etienne St. Clair. Like the rest of this book and characters, they are very realistic. Etienne St. Clair was a history lover, short, awkward, sweet and a whole bunch of other things all rolled into one.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins has written a magical, funny, sweet, awkward and awesome debut. She's a great writer who really knows how tell a good story and knows how the inside of a girl's mind works when it comes to the question: Does he like me or not?
B00171EO0I|5.0|I simply adore this movie.  It's funny, sad, silly, and sexy, thanks to Gerard Butler and JEFFREY DEAN MORGAN!!! I have watched this movie many times already and I'm certain I will many more.  :-D
0525423281|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss, Stephanie Perkins' debut novel became one of all favorite books ever! I was a little worried about this novel since not a lot of sophomore books turn out as good as the first book. I'm mad at myself for even thinking that Lola and the Boy Next Door wouldn't be as good as ANNA.<br /><br />I'm going to talk about something that I loved a lot in LOLA: Lola's two dads are not only really great loving parents but they are actually part of her life! They influence her decisions and she respects them and they have a great relationship. I loved Andy and Nathan. PLUS, they're gay dads; not a lot of those in YA books!<br /><br />Lola. What can I say about this girl? She's really independent and unique and doesn't wear the same outfit twice; she always looks different. She's okay with being different and not always fitting in. She's got Max, her boyfriend and Lindsey, her best friend at her side! I didn't connect to her right away like I did with Anna and that's probably because the conflict of liking Cricket but dating Max led her to make so bad decisions. But I loved her for always being her and for realizing the mistakes she made.<br /><br />Cricket. Oh, guys, I've realized I've got a thing for smart, sometimes clumsy, romantic, and funny guys who also invent things. AKA Cricket Bell. I.LOVED.THIS.BOY. From the second he came onto the page, I knew I was going to love him. He was such a genuine good guy who realized that he'd hurt Lola and wanted to start over with her. And you know, he happens to live in the same dorm with another hot guy...He's American with a British accent? Um, Etienne St. Clair anyone? Anna and St. Clair are back in this book and are good friends with Lola. I love that they're actually in the book and not just mentioned in it!<br /><br />Now I know all of you are wondering if I liked it better than ANNA and I have to say: I consider Anna and the French Kiss and Lola and the Boy Next Door to be siblings. Like with any sibling, it is never okay to compare them. Each person is their own self and comparing them is wrong. That's what I think of this. While they are companion novels, ANNA and LOLA are two different novels. They had different plot arcs that yes, had some similar features but ,for instance, Anna didn't dress up like Lola does. Lola didn't got to school in Paris! So now, I don't think LOLA was better than ANNA. I enjoyed both of them at the same level. They are both at the #1 spot on my list of favorite books!<br /><br />Overall, Stephanie Perkins has written yet another funny, cute, unique, realistic, romantic book that I read in about 4 hours! I loved her characters and her ability to tell such good stories! I'm a little mad since Isla and the Happily Ever After comes out next year.NEXT YEAR! It's too far away!

0061692042|5.0|Some might call this wonderful book a coming-of-age novel, but this classification does not quite fit, even though the protagonist is a fifteen year old boy, Dell Parsons.  The narrator is in fact the grown up Dell Parsons, a man recently retired from teaching school in a Canadian city, and it is he who opens the book with the flat declaration: \\"First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then the murders, which happened later.\\"  The novel that unfolds from these two sentences is the man's attempt to understand what happened to the boy.<br /><br />Much of the novel is indeed told from the perspective of a teenaged boy from Great Falls, Montana, one with little experience of the world. His twin sister, Berner, calls him \\"stupid\\" for his preoccupation with his chess set and his plans to raise bees. However, it is the adult voice, speaking through the boy, that returns again and again to the central preoccupation of the novel: how quickly the most mundane events turn toward disaster: \\"The prelude to very bad things can be ridiculous . . .but it can also be casual and unremarkable.\\"  This prelude might be cleaning the house or starting a complicated jigsaw puzzle, both of which take place on the day before the heartbreaking arrest of Dell's parents, an event which is not a surprise for the reader but which Dell and his sister, shocked past words, cannot see coming because they are still children.<br /><br />Some readers have commented unfavorably on what seems to be the repetitious nature of Dell's observations about what is happening to him. It is true that, with the exception of the Saskatchewan murders, there is not a lot of action in this novel. It is, rather, an extended meditation on the way one's life can change, completely and forever, without the least warning, in a matter of seconds. What makes it such a pleasure to read is the combination of the growing self-awareness of the boy, with his sharp powers of observation, and the understanding of the man, whose entire life has been a different kind of coming-of-age, one that involves the acceptance of loss, the mitigation of cynicism, and the attempt \\"to connect unequal things into a whole that preserves the good.\\"<br /><br />M. Feldmanman, whose entire life has been a different kind of coming-of-age, one that involves the acceptance of loss, the mitigation of cynicism, and the attempt \\"to connect unequal things into a whole that preserves the good.\\"<br /><br />M.

B007ELN8Y8|2.0|I guess it didn't stink on ice. But no one apparently ever sat down and worked out what the film was supposed to be. If it was supposed to be an exercise in making a new silent film in the old style, it just didn't happen. And who would care, anyway, outside of a film class assignment.<br /><br />If it was supposed to be a new form of silent film, at least it wasn't the classic style. But again, who cares? It wasn't any kind of new story. Tiresome.<br /><br />If it was supposed to be a film about the silent film era, it was seriously marred by the inept attempt to emulate the old silent genre.<br /><br />Yes, it won Oscars. But note that you can win Oscars any day with a halfway competent film about the film industry. SAG people are such narcissists.<br /><br />So, meh! You'll probably want to see it, just because...  But don't expect much.

B008BIN9EW|5.0|Been playing this since 2009, it has remained my favorite.  They released a map editor on Android, which has breathed new life into the game. It reminds me a lot of playing custom starcraft maps.  If they find a way to add scripting and triggers, they could release a truly incredible new edition.

He took it a children's comic, and turned it into something much darker, subtle, and adult.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" was raw, \\"The Dark Knight\\" was ponderous, and \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is a satisfying end to the trilogy.<br /><br />There are a lot of issues with this movie.  The script is more pretentious than it is compelling, the similarities of the plot to the French Revolution amateurish, and the climactic fight between Bane's followers and the police disturbingly silly (what kind of police would run into an army with machine guns?).  And Nolan being Nolan he has to add meaning and substance and parallels and symbols, which burdens the movement of the movie (Christopher, we're just looking for a lot of cool gadgets and big explosions!).<br /><br />The best part of the movie is the on-screen chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Christian Bale, and it's this on-screen chemistry that brings coherence and order to an otherwise incoherent and disorderly film.  Hathaway is simply ravishing as Catwoman, and Bale has developed grit and character since we last saw him in \\"The Dark Knight.\\"  It's simply enough to see the two together.

1400069289|3.0|In \\"The Power of Habit,\\" veteran New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg explains that the power of habit can be explained by its three constituent parts:  cue, routine, reward.  Something (stress, cold weather, hunger) cues smokers into lighting a cigarette (the routine), which then produces pleasure (reward).  Another way of saying this is that lighting up a cigarette produces a dopamine rush in the brain -- which is not true.  Perhaps the first time we light up or drink up or make a bet at the blackjack table there is that \\"hit,\\" but gradually the intensity of each \\"hit\\" decreases until we are stuck with the cue and the routine without the reward -- we just do it because we're too lazy to change.<br /><br />We could learn this by reading Dan Ariely's excellent \\"Predictably Irrational,\\" which tells us that people have a tendency to randomly fall into habits, and once they do they rationalize their habits.  It could be that one day we see a big line outside Starbucks, and so we go in out of curiosity.  Pretty soon, we think Starbucks is the best coffee in the world just because we have a habit of going in.  (What's interesting here is that for new habits -- like drinking coffee at Starbucks -- to form, we must put ourselves into new environment -- and that's why Starbucks worked so hard at creating an ambience so different from other coffeehouses.)<br /><br />Yet a better explanation can be found in Norman Doidge's \\"The Brain that Changes Itself,\\" in which the author introduces us to neuroplasticity, how brain structures can change, but once they do we, out of sheer laziness, grow accustomed and comfortable to their structural change -- thus, forming habit.<br /><br />There's no reward for having a habit -- habits are so because they're subconscious actions that cost us little mental energy to execute.<br /><br />The only interesting part of the book is that habits tend to take hold in communities, which then leads to individual habits.  That's very true.If you just hang out with a group of fat friends, chances are you'll be fat.  If you want to lose weight, then change your friends.

B00441GYZQ|5.0|....If your wife hasn't cheated on you...you just won't get this film at all....In 1999 at the time of this film's realease I was a happily married man, just two years later in 2001, my ex-wife began a love affair with someone we knew real well, the affair carried on until 2005, when I saw this film, I could really identify with Ford's character, In this Ford discovers that his wife was having an affair after she has been killed in a plane crash with her lover, he learns that her destination was not where he thought, & as a cop he is crushed by the fact that he never saw it coming, after all, cops are good at this sort of thing, he meets Kristin Scott Thomas who is the other spouse, who more or less is in denial about her husband's infidelity & as a Congresswoman, this is the last thing she needs, most of this film revolves around Ford wanting to know why his wife would do this to him, which is how I felt, he is constantly searching for the truth behind the affair, just as I did, this, right along with Richard Gere's character in \\"Unfaithful\\" depicts the effects that infidelity has on men, men like women are just as devastated, & it is good to get a man's point of view for once, there is this subplot that revolves around Ford chasing down a bad cop (Dennis Haysbert), but for the most part, we see two people asking the question..\\"Why??!!...again unless you have experienced this personally, you will not understand Ford's motivation in his quest to understand why, infidelity is by far one of the worst betrayals in any marriage whether it be the man or woman, here we get both jilted spouses reaction, yes, there is an implied ending that these two(Ford & Thomas) are better for each other, sadly, this rarely happens with spouses of lovers, Harrison Ford has always been one of my favorite actors & I admire him taking on this role, because I was this guy in 2005.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I went into reading this book with an open mind knowing full well that it was a simple potentially entertaining read......much like twilight even though I hated the twilight characters.........what I couldn't get past though is the writing style. It really did feel like reading a teenagers fantasy.  From what I hear of the story line it could have had all the potential in the world if it had had been written well.......as it is I chewed my way through to the first \\"sex\\" scene and couldn't go any further.

The best way I can describe her writing is colorful...it takes me to the place of her story, and I feel like I'm watching as if I were there. This story drew me in from the 1st page. The Libby Day character is a very deep, complex soul. I find my self wanting to know more about her as I read, and Ms. Flynn doesn't disappoint. This is definitely a \\"must read!\\"

0061537969|5.0|This tale about a kind and decent young man whose goal in life is to become a professional race car driver is told through the eyes of his beloved dog Enzo.  Both Denny's wife, Eve and daughter, Zoe love Enzo and he loves them too.  Many of Denny's life conflicts are analyzed in terms of race car wisdom and jargon.  Denny works as a mechanic in a shop that specializes in high end European cars. He moonlights as a race car driving instructor, a racer and performing in advertisementss. This is why guys will love it. What guy doesn't dream of putting the pedal to the metal in a souped up Ferrari.  Unfortunately, Denny faces a terrible tragedy compounded by the selfish meddling of his wealthy in-laws.  His beloved wife dies after a grueling battle with brain cancer.  Denny is kind enough to agree to leave his wife in her parents care when she is released from the hospital and told she has 6 to 8 months to live.  Because his 5 year old daughter, Zoe will lose her mother at such a young age, he agrees to also leave her in their care so she can spend as much time as possible with her dying mother.  Denny returns to the small but comfortable Seattle home with Enzo his beloved dog.  He is terribly distraught and lonely.  He loves his wife, Eve and cannot bear to think of losing her.  Still he suffers alone without the light of his life, Zoe, to brighten his mood.  He takes her home on occassion and she tells him how she would rather stay with him.  Her grandparents give her many material things and a beautiful girly bedroom in their spacious Mercer Island home, but she would still prefer to be with Denny.  She understands the situation as much as a 5 year old can.  She loves her dying mother too.  Denny and Eve were wonderful and responsive parents to Zoe so she is a lovely little girl.  After Eve dies, her parents ask Denny to give up custody of Zoe so that they can raise her amid all the material things they can give her.  They want to send her to private school and latercollege, but Denny steadfastly refuses.  When he does so the grandparents file a petition for custody alleging that Denny committed statutory rape with a 15 year old girl.  The charge is false, but Denny must contend with the reality of it nonetheless. He hires one of his well to do successful attorney clients to represent him.  After 3 years Denny is penniless.  He borrowed on his house and finally  was forced to sell it.  He  moves with Enzo into a small apartment without a backyard.  Because of the criminal charges against him, Denny cannot leave Washington State.  Thus his racing career which was about to take off was stymeid.  Penniless and at his wits end, financing comes thru an unexpected source.  Denny wins his criminal case and the custody battle. Enzo was his steadfast mainstay throughout his ordeal.  Enzo and Denny were together before Denny met his wife.<br />By age 8, Enzo was suffering from hip problems and arthritus.  Then he was hit by a car. The impact was not enough to kill him, but it did hurt him.  By age 10 he had trouble walking and controlling his bladder.  He was living a very undignified life.  Yet he held on because he knew Denny needed him.  He was able to let go when Denny won his legal battles.  Yes this book is a bit schmaltzy as one critic observed.  However, it is a page turner and a fast and easy read.  It is highly entertaining.  It would be nice if every book could be as good as Cutting For Stone, but mainly a book should be entertaining.  I think most readers will find it so.  Yes, it has a Hollywood ending, but any book told from the point of view of the family dog has to be a bit Hollywoodish. Also for those of you who still read paper copy books, the print is larger than usual.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've been somewhat of a fan of Sony headphones for a while, my first pair being the MDR-V150 back in 2006 for $20. I remember at the time thinking how much better those were than anything I had before. A year ago (2011), I had bought the ZX-100 and had that same feeling all over again. I felt everything just had a lot more punch to it with deeper bass and higher highs.<br /><br />The first time I used these was at a friend's graduation party in June of 2012 where he was showing off a game his team had made at Digipen. I put these on and was instantly taken aback by how well the 7506's sealed out the outside world. I fired up the game, and knew right away these headphones were something special. Deep, heart-jolting base... crystal clear highs... simply beautiful. I can't recommend these highly enough. If you're in the market for a decent pair of higher end cans, these NEED to be on your list of considerations. You won't be disappointed.

044024630X|5.0|In 1997, Major Jack Reacher is sent to Mississippi to investigate the murder of a young white woman.  The town where she lived happens to have a military base full of Army Rangers.<br /><br />Jack runs into the local sheriff-and ex-marine-named Elizabeth Deveraux.  The two join forces-in more ways than one-and a potential suspect soon emerges-one that may have murdered more than one woman.<br /><br />I loved this book!  The author takes us back to the latter days of Reacher's military career and the events that led to his leaving.  I found the story to be an enjoyable action packed tale and the best Reacher novel I've read in a while.

1608191664|5.0|Economist Ha-Joon Chang challenges conventional thinking about economics with 23 points you may not know about market economies. He takes on those who righteously defend unbridled free-market capitalism and minimal regulation as the only paths to financial nirvana for all. Using compelling research, statistics and case studies, Chang explains how change disarms the fiercest \\"free-marketeers\\" of their received wisdom. While some of his arguments may be debatable, he offers an interesting alternative to the other explanations for the world's currently dismal fiscal dilemma and uncertain political landscape. getAbstract recommends this fresh interpretation to readers interested in their own, and the world's, economic future.

0345803507|3.0|(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis. Thanks to Books for Reviews [...])  This is the third book in the `fifty shades' series, and opens to Ana and Christian on honeymoon. We get some flashbacks to the wedding and wedding night, and then it's back to normal controlling Christian, and Ana who is always doing things that she doesn't consider will annoy Christian.    The rest of the storyline focuses on Christian and Ana getting used to married life, and the myriad of things that Christian finds to complain at Anna about, the weirdo who seems to be stalking them, an emergency for Ana, and a couple of unexpected events.    As you can see, the summary of this book is pretty short, mainly because the whole point of the book is to read about Christian and Ana's love-making rather than anything else. The storyline is basically just a vehicle for their erotic encounters, and while we all know that this is the case, if I say too much, you won't have any surprises if you chose to read this book!    I personally am in two minds over this book. As I said, it's mainly focused on the erotica, so if that's what you're looking for, then you're going to get what you're looking for, if you're looking for a bit more of a `story', then you might be disappointed.    The main issues I had with the book were related to repetition and just plain cheesiness! Every few lines it was `Mrs Grey' this and `Mr Grey' that. I know that they've just gotten married, but this was something that continued through the entire book, and just went past the possible `sweet' connotations of these titles. The other thing was the over the top, almost cringe-worthy moments, when Ana and Christian would say or do things that were just sickening.  Eg: `I kiss his plain platinum wedding ring. He groans and closes his eyes.'  I know they've just got married, but I really don't see how kissing his ring is erotic, or anything but just plain cheesy.    That being said though, I enjoyed this book more than the second, although not as much as the first. There were some glimpses of the flirty Christian that we met in the first book, but the tone of the book is a little tamer than the first. If you're a fan of the series though, then you're sure to like this instalment.  6.5 out of 10.

0385333846|5.0|I've long heard people mention Kurt Vonnegut as a great American author and Slaughterhouse-Five as one of America's great novels, but I never really knew much about either of them.  I think someone had once told me this was a book set during World War II, but I guess I'd forgotten that.  I wasn't sure what to expect as I opened the novel...maybe something about working in slaughterhouses?  I certainly wasn't expecting what I found...a strange little work of fiction that bounces around time nonlinearly and even into science fiction while exploring the ideas of fate, mortality and free-will.<br /><br />The book opens with an introductory preface explaining how the narrator (potentially Vonnegut's voice, but since it's a fictionalized introduction, he's distanced himself from it) is qualified to tell a story set in World  War II and why he is writing the book. After this kind of odd introduction, we are thrown into the story of a man named Billy Pilgrim.  The plot meanders through time and presents Billy's life in a very non-linear fashion.  We jump back and forth between Billy's early life, his early experiences in the war, his time as a POW, and his post-war life.  The events are often intermingled or juxtaposed in ways that make the plot line slightly disorienting.<br /><br />The narrator allows for this nonlinear jumping around through an odd element that really caught me off guard.  This is also a science fiction novel.  About midway through his life, Billy is abducted by aliens...Tralfamadorians.  He is taken to their planet and placed in a zoo within a \\"cage\\" built to resemble a human home.  The Tralfamadorians have a different concept of time....they see in four-dimensions.  They see and experience all moments of time in a single instant.  Past, Present and Future exist all at once to them.  As Billy spends time in their zoo, he becomes \\"unstuck in time\\" and also experiences life in four dimensions with everything very nonlinear.<br /><br />The narrative is anexamination of Billy's life in a way that lets us see how events lead to consequences.  But the causality shown is presented in a very matter-of-fact way.  Everything happens.  It just happens.  Even if you know the future ahead of time (as the Tralfamadorians do...and as Billy later does), there isn't any desire to stop things from happening or alter the future in any way.  In fact, they suggest that fate cannot be changed.<br /><br />Billy is a soldier (really a chaplain's aid, and not very well trained as a soldier) captured by the Germans in World War II and taken to Dresden in time to be present for the bombing that destroyed the city and many/most of its inhabitants.  After the war he returns home to become an optometrist and marries the daughter of a prominent optometrist in his town.  Around this time he is taken by the aliens and spends time in their zoo and becomes unstuck in time.  After he returns to Earth, he begins telling the world about his experience.  Finally he announces that he knows how, where and when he will be killed...and then it happens.  So it goes.<br /><br />The narrator apologizes for the length and jumbled nature of the book and excuses it by pointing out that there is \\"nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.\\"  Even though he points out that this book is about the War and the bombing of Dresden, much of the book takes place outside of the War but in a way that comments on war and mortality.<br /><br />The style of writing is very straightforward and direct.  The sentences and overall structure is short and to the point.  The plot itself is fairly simplistic either as a war novel or as a science fiction novel.  And yet, the whole package is very thick and nuanced with all sorts of strange ideas and themes.  I suspect that it is this depth within simplicity that has made this novel stand out.<br /><br />Through the circular timeline as well as textual repetition, the author makes subtle points again and again.  Probably the most commonly repeated phrase in the book is the sentence \\"So it goes\\" which the author writes every time someone or something dies.  It's a very matter-of-fact commentary on the nature of death.  This short refrain is almost humorous when juxtaposed against some of the more tragic or horrific deaths within the book.  On the one sense it seems to speak to the desensitizing nature of war that the narrator and Billy can both look at death in such a nonchalant manner.<br /><br />In another sense it emphasizes the authors Tralfamadorian notion that death is just part of life and there's nothing especially noteworthy about it.  This concept (coupled with the idea of fate and lack of any personal will) creates a sort of passive view of life and existence.  To me this is a pretty depressing viewpoint.  Essentially it negates any personal choices I might make, suggesting that \\"it\\" (the universe?) already knows what choices I'm going to make and my entire path is plotted.  This sort of thinking is a little paradoxical in my mind.  If we take out agency and tell somebody that no matter what they do, they're going to have this outcome, then a person could become apathetic, lazy and despondent and not do anything...and as a result, fate must necessarily change to accommodate the change in behavior.  Or had fate already accounted for the lackadaisical change in attitude and  integrated it into your path.  All in all, fate and predestination are strange concepts that I just can't get behind.  I guess I'm not Tralfamadorian enough yet.  ;)<br /><br />Overall I'm not entirely sure yet what to make of this book.  Generally speaking, I enjoyed it.  Emotionally I found myself bouncing around.  Sometimes I would laugh at the absurdity of things or at the attitudes of the characters.  Other times I was horrified at the senseless tragedy of war and the destruction and death that comes with it.  I do acknowledge that it should be read by a more mature audience if only for some of the language andsome of the descriptions of war scenes.  They aren't overly graphic, but certainly not intended for kids.<br /><br />There are a lot of themes and concepts ripe to be unpacked and considered.  From merely a plot standpoint, this is a strange little book that can be entertaining.  From a deeper sense, this is a book worth exploring.  I definitely see why it is held up as among the \\"great literature\\" of modern times.<br /><br />*****<br />4.5 out of 5 stars

0062206281|4.0|Carlos Ruiz Zafón was born in Barcelona in 1964. His first book, \\"The Prince of Mist\\", was first published in Spain in 1994 and was aimed at the teen market. His first book for adults, \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\", was his fifth overall and it became an international bestseller. It was followed by a prequel, \\"The Angel's Game\\", which was first published in Spain in 2008. \\"The Prisoner of Heaven\\" was the third in this cycle of books and it sees a return for Daniel Sempere - the hero of \\"The Shadow of the Wind.\\" However, we learn a great deal about his trusty sidekick, Fermín Romero de Torres, and there's<br /><br />The book opens in December 1957; Daniel and Bea have been married for two years and live in the attic apartment above the Sempere and Sons bookshop. Fermín, Daniel's trusty sidekick, still works in the bookshop and is busy making preparations for his looming wedding. He, is, unsurprisingly, getting a little worked up about the ceremony - but there's a little more to his pre-nuptial nerves than would be usual. Things aren't helped when a mysterious stranger calls into the bookshop asking for Fermín. By way of a message, he buys an extremely expensive copy of \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" and writes a pointed dedication - a dedication that worries Fermín deeply. Fermín soon tells the full story to Daniel - although it's a story he'd rather have kept to himself. it dates back to his time in Montjuïc Prison, when the prisoner in a neighbouring cell was David Martin - the lead character in \\"The Angel's Game\\", and an old friend of Daniel's mother.<br /><br />I've slightly mixed feelings about \\"The Prisoner of Heaven\\"...having got to the end of the book, it felt like the story hadn't been fully told. (I'm guessing Zafon was just setting things up for the sequel, which is a little frustrating. Both \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" and \\"The Angel's Game\\" are roughly twice the length of this one and told their stories in full). However, what there was of it, I enjoyed thoroughly and I'll definitely be buying the follow-up. One thing, though - the book opens with a note, saying that the books written to date can be read in any order; I'd still recommend reading them in the order they were published.
B006OV7RQ4|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />Jaw-dropping performances are the hallmark of \\"Martha Marcy May Marlene,\\" a grimly fascinating look into a damaged soul.<br /><br />Martha (the astonishing Elizabeth Olsen) has grown up with virtually no guidance or support from a parental figure.  She does have an older sister, Lucy (the equally superb Sarah Paulson), who feels ill-equipped to deal with the demands placed on her by Martha's wayward ways.  Lost and confused, Martha thus becomes the perfect candidate for a bizarre communal cult to draw into its web, a cult tucked away in a rural portion of upstate New York, one that is based on a strict patriarchal system and ruled over by a messianic figure (John Hawkes) who sexually and psychologically abuses the girls in his charge.  Though we don`t know how long she`s been there, we meet Martha on the night she`s decided to make a run for it by fleeing into the nearby woods.  She eventually makes it to her sister's home in Connecticut, but Martha soon discovers that it's a great deal easier to break away from such a place physically than it is psychologically.<br /><br />And does she bring emotional baggage with her!  The problem is that she keeps it all bottled up inside, refusing to let her sister in on any of the experiences she's been through.  As a result, Lucy and her husband, Ted (Hugh Dancy), are left frustrated and baffled by her bizarre behavior and completely ill-equipped to help her overcome her problems.<br /><br />\\"Martha Marcy May Marlene\\" (Marcy May is the name conferred on her by the cult leader) is a haunting, understated film where much of the drama seems to be taking place beneath the surface of the action.  The screenplay by Sean Durkin, who also directed the film, moves seamlessly back and forth between the present time set in Connecticut and Martha's recent experiences at the commune.  In some ways, Martha seems like a smart, level-headed young woman who's equipped with enough in the way of survival skills to get her this far in life.  Yet, she is also obviously highly vulnerable and easily influenced, and her ability to so easily lose sight of long-established social mores speaks to the far-reaching effect the cult leaders have had on her.<br /><br />The movie doesn't provide the audience with easy answers, nor does it assuage their concern for the character with anything remotely resembling a conclusive ending.  It respects the characters too much to be in any way untrue to them.  Watching this extraordinarily well-acted film is like observing a fascinating but challenging case-study in morbid psychology.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. A lot of people complain that they have to spend money, however I've never spent a penny. I recommend parents to make sure there children know its not ok to spend real money on the game so they don't get surprise charges.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|The only glitch I've encountered is a force close freeze every so often, never a timer problem. I'm absolutely addicted to this game, you don't have to buy stuff with real money to have fun and level up. It's definitely a game to play when you have a quick break in the day. The graphics are great and there are goals to finish so you're not just mindlessly building a town. The quests seem to never end, which is awesome considering I play it all the time and have completed over 100. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys games like Farmville. I consider it a million times better than Farmville, though.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I bought this cover because it looks like an old book...I receive Many compliments on the cover too. I read the reviews before I bought it, and those mentioning the tight fit of the elastic corners are true (but a good thing, as the unit does not slip around in or out of the cover), and those relating how the cover would not close all the way, at first, are also true.  However, I just turned the top flap behind while reading, and kind of \\"mashed\\" the spine in that position and then always placed the Fire face down on the table and it quickly broke in and now fits perfectly. I do not have a screen protector on my Fire, and this cover does not mark or imprint on the screen.  I highly recommend this cover to those of us who like the old book look and \\"leather\\" feel.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I bought this case for going to camp and six flags this summer.  It took a few days to get used to the screen, using the smaller charging cables, and unscrewing the headphone piece, but it was very much worth it! At camp not one speck of dust got inside the case nor did it get affected by sweat.  At Six Flags it stayed in my pocket when I got soaked by water rides. It also got smashed by the bar across my lap on a roller coaster and I was worried the screen or back would be cracked.  Not at all!! Wonderful protective case!

B005LAIHZY|5.0|On a spur of the moment decision, we took the kids to see Brave.  I have to admit that I was probably more excited to see this film than some of the kids (my oldest son almost backed out to stay home and do chores instead...what a choice, huh?).  The trailer had me a little nervous as it didn't \\"feel\\" the same as some of the other Pixar movies I've loved.  It almost had a \\"Dreamworks\\" studio feel...which isn't a bad thing since I've enjoyed some Dreamworks movies, but I was worried that it wouldn't be all that I hoped for and expected.  So, even though the trailer didn't put forth a whole lot in terms of the overall plot, I went into this film with pretty high expectations just because it's from Pixar.<br /><br />And hands down, my expectations were met.  If anybody else loves Pixar and was worried (as I was) that this film was a departure from their usual magic, put those fears aside.  This movie is great.<br /><br />Before talking about the movie, I want to comment on the \\"short\\" before the film.  As with all Pixar movies (and more and more on other animated films as well), they had a short cartoon.  This one was called \\"La Luna.\\"  It starts with a young boy sitting in the middle of the water with two older men.  There are no words but a lot of mumbled grunts and other unspoken language.  As the title suggests, the short involves the Moon.  Through most of the short it felt like we were balancing between a lovely piece of artwork and silly humor that tried to stop just short of the slapstick humor of cartoon.  But then, in the final moments of the short there is a great image that pulls everything together in a surprising way that is absolutely fantastic and makes the whole thing very endearing and special.  This one is a sweet and fun showcase of talent.<br /><br />Similar to the surprising twist in the short, there was a surprise for me in the movie itself.  From the trailer, it looked like the plot would be about an outspoken girl who doesn't want to get married because she has too much fun being a warrior boy.  She's at odds with her parents (mostly her mother) and sets out in search of a way to change things.  That's where the trailer left it....and it left me thinking this might be a Mulan-esque story where she goes off on some sort of adventure (again making me nervous that maybe we'd just have a rehashed story).<br /><br />The trailer is a bit sneaky.  I haven't looked to see if they've released a new, more revealing trailer but I can tell you that the original trailers were somewhat misleading in terms of the overall plot and story arc of this movie.  With a couple of brief, disjointed exceptions, I think all of the scenes from the trailer come only from the first half (or less) of the movie.  About one-third or one-half of the way through the movie there is a big twisty plot element that makes this movie very different from what I expected.  I won't spoil it for you since the surprise is a lot of fun and it makes for a very compelling second half of the movie.  I don't think the movie would be any less enjoyable if you know what's going to happen, but the thrill of the reveal is a lot of fun, so I'll leave you to it.<br /><br />The story is not 100% fresh and unique.  In fact it borrows themes and elements from other stories.  But it is told in a fresh, humorous and compelling way.  The writing and directing is fabulous and keeps the pacing and fun.  It was filled with great banter as well as some awesome non-verbal communication.  Merida's little brothers never really speak...and yet they are super evocative and funny.  Other characters later in the movie also have super non-verbal communication.<br /><br />Near the very end of the movie the staging of the scene was powerful enough that I looked next to me as Lynette gasped in fear and whispered \\"oh no\\" and looked like she might cry.  Even knowing this was a children's film, there was enough tension and emotion invoked that she was worried things might all fall apart.<br /><br />The artwork is superb as is expected from Pixar.  Some of the scenery and landscape shots were absolutely stunning and looked almost photo-realistic.  There was a scene where Merida and her mother were walking through the forest and at quick glance it looked almost like a live-action movie rather than a cartoon.  Still, the colors and palette were vibrant and cartoony enough to maintain the animation aspect, but I was very impressed with the art.  The grass.  The water.  The hair.  The cloth.  Great work.<br /><br />The music was also great.  The score is wonderfully engrossing and a lot of fun.  They presented a wonderfully Celtic vibe and had some great vocal selections as well (all background...there aren't any musical numbers in the movie).<br /><br />Over the years I have absolutely loved the Pixar films.  I've been a big Disney fan since I was a little kid and enjoy those movies but I have to admit that some of the Disney animated films of the past decade(s) have lost some of their charm and magic.  Amid the slight slump from Disney, I feel like Pixar has picked up the slack.  There are certainly Pixar films I like more than others and I haven't seen all of them (the only full-length film I haven't seen is Ratatouille) but I really like all of their work and totally love many of them.<br /><br />As I mentioned I was initially nervous that this film might be a departure from the Pixar magic that I know and love.  My fears were unfounded and Brave was as fabulous an experience as I have come to expect and enjoy from Pixar.  There are a couple of scenes that might be a little intense for very young viewers...and there was a scene where you see bare male bottoms (as my wife pointed out to the kids, it shows verisimilitude in the fact that there often wasn't anything worn beneath the kilts...not that it was necessary to put it into the movie, but it was some generally tasteful comic relief).<br /><br />Overall I really had a ton of fun with this movie and look forward to seeing it again.  All of the family really enjoyed it (even my oldest who initially didn't plan on coming).  If you're on the fence but have enjoyed Pixar in the past, I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed.  If you're not a fan of cartoons and kids movies, this one might just straddle the fence enough between childish and grown up to help you have fun.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 stars

B001KMB6X2|5.0|I agree with the positive reviews of this film.<br /><br />The best \\"uncut\\" version of this film is the two disc special edition (\\"EXTENDED CUT\\").  The editing is much better on the \\"extended cut\\" (more recent version).  [[ASIN:B001KMB6YG Babylon A.D. (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]  The theater release for American audiences (the single disc version) was poorly cut .  It eliminates much of the character development of the actors.  It also omits much of the dialogue necessary to understand the film.  However, the two disc special version is: (a) widescreen HD; (b) mixed much better so that you can hear the actors talking over the soundtrack (without subtitles); and (c) contains dialogue which explains the plot of the movie.  The two-disc special version also includes a digital copy so that you can install it on your PC or Mac  and view it on an iPod, iPhone, etc.<br /><br />This film is based on the book [[ASIN:0345505972 Babylon Babies]].  The story in the book is about Melanie Thierry's character being a surrogate mother for two babies who represent the next step in human evolution.  It is very difficult to understand the ending to Babylon AD without knowing that the babies she carries are special (\\"homo sapiens sapiens\\") genetically engineered children.  Thierry's character, herself, is gifted, but, in the dark future, people think she is carrying a virus instead of recognizing her gifts and powers as a positive development for humanity.<br /><br />In the opening narration Vin Diesel explains the film:<br /><br />\\"Life is simple.  Kill or be killed. . . .  Don't get involved. . . .  Always finish the job.  [Mercenaries' Code]  . . . . But I learned that you can't always walk away.  Too bad it was the day I died.\\"<br /><br />The film is based in the not too distant (dark) future.  Vin Diesel (Toorop) is a mercenary.  He is on the terrorist list in the U.S.  The film begins with him walking to his apartment in Russia where he lives as an expat former Marine.<br /><br />At some point he meets up with Gerard Depardieu (an international thug) who hires him to escort a young woman (played by Melanie Thierry) to New York.  Thierry plays an innocent intuitive who has special powers to sense danger, heal, and know how to do things without ever being taught.  She is an empath who has been completely sheltered in a convent all of her life.  Michelle Yeoh (in a very sexy and convincing role) plays one of the older nuns in the convent who goes with Diesel and Thierry to New York.<br /><br />The plot that unfolds is witty, action-packed and full of great one-liners.  For example, when Diesel meets Yeoh for the first time, she tells him that she has three rules: (1) She must go wherever Thierry goes; (2) he is to protect Thierry from the corruption of the outside world and (3) no foul language.\\"  Diesel responds with a wry laugh and says:  \\"Sh__.  Well it's a tough world out there, Sister.  (changing his laugh to a look of dead seriousness)  You listen to my one and only rule:  Don't f____ with me or I'll leave you in the middle of nowhere with nothing but your a___ to sell to get back here to your perfect world.\\"  Only Vin Diesel could get away with that line.<br /><br />In another scene, a little later, Diesel, Thierry and Yeoh are walking through a marketplace in Siberia.  It is dirty, noisy and chaotic.  Diesel tells Yeoh and Thierry to watch out because it's a dangerous place - \\"No Mercy for the weak.\\"  Yeoh says: \\" Just because we are peaceful does not mean we are weak.\\"  Diesel says:  \\"It does here.\\"<br /><br />I had to use the subtitles on the single disc version (because of the poorly mixed soundtrack) to get some of the subtle humor in the film, but, there is sophisticated humor in almost every scene.  Charlotte Rampling plays an all too convincing role as the corrupt head of large, popular, mass-media religion.  At one point she is chastising her staff for letting Diesel get away with Melanie Thierry.  She tells them that they have ruined twenty years of her work.  Since Melanie Thierry is pregnant, and still a virgin, she was a miracle and had them on the verge of being a \\"bona fide religion.\\"  This is great sarcasm and social satire and worthy of a five star rating.<br /><br />The movie makes more sense if you can read a little Russian.  Although this is never brought out in the film, Diesel is playing a clone.  In one of the scenes you will see the Russian word for \\"clone\\" tattooed in Cyrillic across his knuckles.<br /><br />The uncut version [[ASIN:B001O12PCU Babylon A.D. (Uncut)]] contains about fifteen extra minutes of fascinating action footage that was intended for European and Russian audiences.  It is common for stars like Vin Diesel, in Russia and Europe, to have films that are three to three and a half hours in length.  The uncut version is worth watching for anyone who is a fan of any of the actors.[[ASIN:B001O12PCU Babylon A.D. (Uncut)]]<br /><br />The original soundtrack is available [[ASIN:B001EP69KK Babylon A.D. (OST)]].  Unfortunately, it is missing one of the best pieces in the film.  The film opens, and ends, with a very well-done (and well-mixed) performance of \\"Dueuces\\" by Achozen.  This rap piece isn't available for purchase.  You can listen to it on YouTube.  The score in this film was done by Atli &Ouml;rvarsson, an Icelandic composer who works with Hans Zimmer (As good as it Gets, Black Hawk Down, Last Samurai . . . .)  The score is an impressive, surreal blend of modern rap, African rhythms and classical music.  It is one of the best features of this film.<br /><br />This film is directed by Mathieu Kassovitz.

Its that good.<br /><br />I deducted a star because of Disney forcing me into getting into Blu-ray. No, thank you very much, I can make my own mind about it. We are living in a recession, I am not buying all my favorite movies all over again to help you meet your financial goals this quarter. Why did I have to pay an extra $10 to get a blu-ray I wll not play and dont want to play? Unfair, as the DVD is a must.
075640407X|3.0|Patrick Rothfuss's \\"The Name of the Wind\\" was recommended to me by a waiter at one of my favorite local restaurants.  The comment he made which persuaded me to \\"listen\\" to this book on audio was that the main character Kvothe narrated the story in a straightforward way that he enjoyed even though the locale of the book takes place in some pseudo-medieval place where horses are vehicles and capes are coats.  Magic somewhat abounds, but its made believable, explained in a way that makes sense and enhances the story line.  Always willing to take into account what the young and hunky consider reading treasures, I finished listening to a download of \\"the Name of the Wind\\" this morning, trying with great difficulty not to take into account the really bad audio book snafus that at times had me scratching my head wondering if the chapters were sequenced properly.  The audio version I purchased from iTunes jumbled the story towards the end--one minute I'd be listening to the portion of the book when Kvothe and Denna were out on the road and the next I'd be back in the University town where Kvothe would be knee-deep in another intellectual skirmish.<br /><br />This issue, along with the novel's framing--the actual history of Kvothe--his childhood and life at the university is told in flashback from the perspective of an older Kvothe who owns and tends bar in a tavern--led to much confusion and made for a rather disjointed plot which in places was actually repeated.  The audio ends with a plug to listen to the next in the series, played some music and then repeated another thirty-five minutes of material I had already heard.  This leads me to wonder how much of the original book I actually absorbed due to bad engineering because the entire end portion seemed rushed, unexplained and left me hanging.<br /><br />And not in a good way.  \\"The Name of the Wind\\" does not come to a reasonable conclusion.  The reflective interlude between the Chronicler and Bast at the end of the novel--at least I hope it was the end--seems trivial. Its understood implicitly that Kvothe, as a man who is in hiding, is psychologically bereft with regards to his old life and perhaps his failure to be able to live his life fully as who he is. Of course, all this will be resolved in later offerings, but as a conclusion to the first book--it disappoints as nothing is resolved.  In fact, the whole present day frame--the attack by the spider-like Scrael creature and Kvothe's relating of his halcyon days to the Chronicler are unwelcome interruptions to the more interesting background tale of Kvothe as a child and young adult.<br /><br />If only Rothfuss had staid the course and used Dicken's [[ASIN:0486415864 Great Expectations (Dover Thrift Editions)]] or [[ASIN:1613821123 David Copperfield]]'s standard narrative style as a guide. For me, the story picked up a little when Kvothe begins to speak--his decision to be an Arcanist adds allure, his life as the son of troubadours adds romance and his misfortune at the hands of the Chandrian give him a reason to survive and seek revenge.  The fact that he is clever and can learn things at a faster rate than others should give him a bit of a disadvantage--usually phenomenally intelligent people do not have much in common with the mainstream and at times are chronically detached--but this doesn't seem to be the case with Kvothe.  Instead, he seems to have his fair share of friends and patrons who enable him to be the mastermind that he is pursuing his dream of attending the University and uncovering the mystery of the Chandrian who murdered his parents.  Kvothe is everything a narrator should be: smart, motivated and likable despite his superior attributes.<br /><br />As any reader would be new to the Four Corners of Civilization world, Rothfuss wisely shows and does not tell.  Kvothe's narration of his exploits engages the reader/listener by revealing bits and pieces of his universe.  The descriptions of the cities, the religionof the people, the role of the Arcanists and their strange expertise as well as Kvothe's ability to make a lute sing all compel Rothfuss's audience to want to know more.  Kvothe's feelings for Denna are well expressed--the pairing of the two in song in the section where Kvothe receives his musician's pipes dramatizes the anxiety and relief of a young man so believably, the reader/listener can almost hear his heart beating over the words of the song.  Obviously, Rothfuss has great ability to set a mood--if only he had eliminated the set-up of the present-day tavern story, Kvothe's tale would have flowed much faster and \\"The Name of the Wind\\" would have been one of those 700 page books that takes only 2 days to read.<br /><br />The distractive structure of this novel as well as the unfortunate ordering of the chapters on my audiobook download and the somewhat annoying Russian accents reader Nick Podehl uses to express certain characters--Master Kilvin and Wilhem in particular--detracts from my overall response to \\"The Name of the Wind.\\"  As episode-one-conclusive\\"ah-ha\\" moments are few and far between, I do not know if I will even give the second story in this trilogy a chance.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Patrick Rothfuss's first book in his Kingkiller Chronicle, \\"The Name of the Wind\\" could have been first rate.  Unfortunately, Rothfuss uses a tired story within a story frame that muddles rather than contributes to what would have been an interesting tale of survival, magic and quest.

B007MU85D0|5.0|I don't think that I've come across a debut album from an Icelandic rock band that was as good as Of Monsters and Men's since Sigur Ros's [[ASIN:B0002SVW3O VON]].  Alright, so maybe Of Monsters and Men is the only other Icelandic rock band that I know... Regardless, of their origin, MY HEAD IS AN ANIMAL is a fantastic album on almost all fronts.  The band's sound is akin to that of Arcade Fire's [[ASIN:B0002IVN9W FUNERAL]] or Mumford and Sons' [[ASIN:B0038BBA4I SIGH NO MORE]].  It's an earthy, heartfelt sound that owes itself to a folky disposition.  Unlike those two other bands though, Of Monsters and Men's album is mostly positive, upbeat, and life-affirming.<br /><br />Honestly, the first time I listened to this album, the only song that really stood out was the lead single \\"Little Talks.\\"  After its first spin, I dismissed the band as a product of hype.  A few weeks later, I picked MY HEAD IS AN ANIMAL up again for another try, and, I'm not sure exactly what changed, but I couldn't believe what I had been missing out.  There's a moral somewhere in this story, but I never seem to learn my lesson, so you might have to figure it out for yourself.<br /><br />Seriously though, I listen to way too much music, and I can honestly say that MY HEAD IS AN ANIMAL is one of 2012's most satisfying releases.  It's a great album to explore, but it's also nice to just have in the background.  The melodies and harmonies are all strong, the instrumentation is wonderful, and the arrangements are all very tasteful.  The band utilizes two vocalists: one male, one female.  Their harmonies melt together in such a way that is reminiscent of [[ASIN:B002MCJZHS THE XX]].  This album is a treat.<br /><br />This album makes me feel guilty about giving other records out there 5-stars.

B000HEWEE4|5.0|It's an unpredictable story.<br />There's a female dog, Jack, seems to play a roll like an angel for Kate and Alex.<br />The lake house's post can deliver something like letters between Alex and Kate.<br />They start writing to each other since when Alex moved in and when Kate moved out.<br />The lake house was built by Alex' dad who are designer.<br />Alex lived there by himself while he's working as an architect to lead staffs to constract 45condos close to the lake.<br />Mona likes Alex, Morgan likes Kate. They are both nice.<br />One day Alex and Mona happened to meet Morgan and he invited them to his girlfriend's (Kate's) birthday party.<br />Alex knew Kate is that Kate that he's writing to. But Kate didn't realize he was that Alex.<br />He talked to her about one book. They kissed each other.<br />Morgan and Mona found them kissing. Morgan was upset and Mona looked sad.<br />Alex seems to completely fall in love with Kate.<br />Kate first realized that he was that Alex  when she's having her another birthday after two years.<br />She was mad at him as he didn't tell her.<br /><br />One day Alex got a call from Henly, his younger brother and knew that his father had been in a hospital due to his heat attack.<br />Alex couldn't completely forgive what his father had done to his mother.<br />After several days(?) his father passed away while his father was processing to publish a book.<br />Kate sent him the father's book as a present to consolate him for his father's dead.<br />Alex couldn't stop his desire of dating with Kate. Alex and Kate was going to date.<br />But Alex skipped. He hadn't come. Kate was pitty.<br /><br />After that despite of no response from Kate, Alex was writing to her over and over.<br />The strange relationship between Alex and Kate seems to be broken.<br /><br />After about a year, Morgan and Kate came to live together.<br />Alex visited Morgan and left the key of the lake house and Jack as he believed these were what Kate needed.<br />He began to ready to open a company with Henly.<br /><br />Although only one device to connect between Alex and Kate was the post at the lake house so far, the device flexibily turns something. like from space over the ceiling to space under the floor.<br /><br />She must have  had still mixed feelings.But she seems to have thought that Morgan likes me. Alex didn't come.<br />I pick Morgan.<br />After her decision, Kate realized a guy who died in her arm two years ago was Alex at the time.<br />She looks nearly panicking and tried to save him. Morgan tried to stop her. She couldn't hear anyting.<br /><br />And the flexible device did work.<br />Finally Alex and Kate could see each other again.<br />There is two years's difference between that Alex and that Kate.<br /><br />the Story could be said it's messed up. but i like it.<br />Keanu's eyes shows me he was shocked and still unable to overcome his mother's death in lonesome and what his dad did to her.<br />The last scene Alex kissed Kate for so long. I can understand he waited for this moment for over two years.<br />But honestly, I shockingly watched it. Hug or short one might be better for me.<br />Henly seems to be perturbed by Alex as he keeps loving an unrealistic woman. He seems pity but was cute.<br />The doctor who operated surgery of Alex's dad is attractive for me. She looks an actual doctor.

030758836X|4.0|I read this dark book in three days.  The plot moved swiftly, if implausibly at times.  The characters are those you love to hate, almost real, although you wouldn't want to include Nick and Amy in your circle of friends.  The writing was terse and tight. In short, this was my kind of story.  However, like many others, I found the ending to be somewhat limp, like a dangling participle.  Ms. Flynn is very clever and talented.  I think she could have provided a better \\"twist\\" at the end.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|The storyline of this book could have easily fit in ONE book, not three!  To stretch it out with an unbelievable surplus of sex scenes that actually became boring (never thought I'd use that description for sex!) is a rip off!  To divide this one book into a \\"trilogy\\" of three books is a obvious marketing ploy to make three times the money!<br /><br />It did have a somewhat interesting storyline, but it was lost in all the other stuff.  Maybe this book is worth $10 -- but certainly not $30!!!
0307951529|5.0|Chris Guillbeau's book has given me a blueprint to running my online business well. My business has been making lackluster profits and sometimes barely paying the bills in the last year, and all of our products are information products. I knew I could do better,but I wasn't sure how, and then Chris's book came out! Everything I needed to get back on track. Not just gobbledygook inspiration stories., but tools and plans to better run your business whether its online or not! The 1 page promotion plan, the outlines on marketing and sales, are invaluable! I'm planning to take copious notes on the 2nd read as I apply them to my business. As I said before resources in the book are invaluable, especially the 39 step product launch checklist. The checklist will be invaluable as I launch two of my products. And the stories aren't there to just inspire you. He makes a point of using them to drive home what you can take from the story. In my opinion Chris has hit a home-run with this book. His first book Art of Non-conformity was a great inspirational read, now he's given you tools to get on the road to owning your own business and loving it!
0671027344|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. I first read this in 1999 when I was a freshman in high school and for me to read a book for pleasure was very rare.<br /><br />People frequently will compare it to The Catcher in the Rye. I can see that based on it focusing on teen angst, relationships, and being coming of age, but the characters are very different. Charlie is a shy, sensitive teenager versus Holden was introspective, but a brat.<br /><br />This is easy reading for me and I find each time I read it that I cannot just put the book down. I love the books so much that I still listen to the CD I made of the songs that Charlie gave Samantha.<br /><br />This is the kind of book I enjoy reading. It isn't unnecessarily lengthy, has interesting characters, isn't predictable, and is well written.<br /><br />I am a bit disappointed that this is now going to become a movie because this book just always felt so special to me and was something I wanted to keep to myself and to the other readers who loved this book so much.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Pretty sure I liked this as much if not a bit more than Where's My Water. The extra dialogue makes it even better. No longer looking for an Angry Birds replacement. Can't wait for the next update :)

B004UJTG6Q|3.0|Mark Twain has to be approached with a grain of salt, as he is quite the satirist and many of his narrative points are quite \\"tongue and cheek.\\"  I consider Mark Twain one of the best satirists about life, and, because he can put such a witty twist and spin on the simplest and more complex things in the world, he is one of my favorite authors. I've seen countless film renditions of both Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer, and I've read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn many times and have read some of Twain's other classics (The Prince and the Pauper, Pudd'nhead Wilson), but this was the first time I actually sat down and read Tom Sawyer.  Therefore, it pains me to admit that I wasn't as impressed with The Adventures of Tom Sawyer as some of his other works.<br /><br />While clearly the book has some humor, adventure and escapism, it seems to have little in the way of focus, meandering around Tom's mischievousness through various episodes.  Sure, there is a bit of loss of innocence and coming of age in Tom, as he does become more mature when he sees the pain and trouble he's caused people close to him (like his aunt, for instance). However, this change of character is brushed over minimally, with more of the focus on Tom, Huck and their gang's adventures and Tom's \\"love\\" for Becky. I don't think this book can hold a candle to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which is much deeper and more meaningful, and has a well-deserved classic status.<br /><br />Sure, Tom Sawyer is a fine read in some ways, and has murder and adventure and some humor and wit, but really there is not much to be gained from the book other than entertainment, entertainment that comes in the form of random episodes that don't really revolve around the central plot (the murder). In the book final stages, we finally see things tie together a little, but mostly the novel feels almost as if it is a series of short stories strung together rather than one novel. There are moments where we see Tom's conscience catching up with him, and feels a sense of moral obligation to help the man wrongly accused of murder, but these are minimal and mostly we just witness the adventures of a mischievous kid.<br /><br />Still, it's Twain, and for that reason alone I would recommend. I guess it just wasn't as good as I had envisioned.<br /><br />3.5 starsience catching up with him, and feels a sense of moral obligation to help the man wrongly accused of murder, but these are minimal and mostly we just witness the adventures of a mischievous kid.<br /><br />Still, it's Twain, and for that reason alone I would recommend.

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Buy the program because was the only one I test that let save documents in word and have no problem opening them in office (just one test) .  First document open after that was a mess, the program do not open document with track changes.  Options too basic.  I'm comparing my tablet to my wife netbook.  The tablet has slightly less the clock speed (however, single core vs quad core) and 1/3 the storage capacity (without the sd card).  I run MS Office 2003 in the netbook and expect to find a good office suite for the table.  Right, different OS, still bellow storage capacity, but the developers should start to move foward.  There are games that use significantly higher storage capacity and procesing power and office suites still similar to my PALM suite 8 yeas ago.

B005MYEQ4U|1.0|This was the dullest and most pretentious movie ever and I want those two hours of my life back. The \\"reality\\" was bad enough - the hapless man with the mean fiancee and her horrible parents (Ugly Americans, all of them), boring us all senseless with their monied friends and acquaintances, sneering at everything, and then onto the \\"time travel\\" part where we were treated to yet another set of cringe-inducing people, ex-patriot literati, including Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. This was unfortunate for me (others may disagree and likely do) because my opinion of the modern era of literature and sometimes art in general is that a great deal of it was produced by people like Hemingway and Fitzgerald, who had their heads stuck so far up their own boozy bums, it was a wonder that they were able to emerge long enough to screw their lives up so completely. If I'd been Gil and had caught that first glimpse of Hemingway glowering and yapping on and on in his self-indulgent way in that tavern, I would have run screaming back to the 21st century, dumped the vile fiancee and her core-rotten family, and headed off into the rain with the nice girl. Which ended up being exactly what he did, in a way. Yawn.

1469984202|5.0|I have never written a review.  However, I loved this book so I felt compelled to write a review so I could get the word out to others.  I enjoy post-apocalyptic fiction.  However, this story isn't as much about survival as it is about humanity.  It is a collection of short novelettes.  But, don't let this dissuade you from reading the Omnibus or each novelette individually.  It reads like one large novel.  I couldn't put the book down.  I could be heard gasping at many shocking and unexpected turns in the book.  Also, I'm an adult but my teenage son also loved the book and has already read the next book in the series \\"First Shift\\".

What an amazing difference you see!

B006RUJST6|2.0|Initial Thoughts:<br />I thought this book would be like another Thoughtless/Effortless which I really liked.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />I liked that Layken was a strong girl. She had to up and move her entire life after her father passes away. She looks after her little brother, as her mom is running \\"errands\\" or \\"working\\" constantly.<br /><br />I really liked Layken's friend Eddie. She provided comic relief to the story.<br /><br />I loved the interaction between the two brothers. It reminded me so much of my own little brother at that age.<br /><br />The slam poetry in the book is something I've never seen before, and that's saying something.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />The whole Will being a teacher thing threw me off. Even though the author \\"explained\\" it, it really didn't see feasible.<br /><br />The chances of Will and Layken being in the same situation are next to nothing. I don't like when books aren't realistic.<br /><br />The writing style wasn't my favorite.<br /><br />The Wrap Up: 2/5<br />This book wasn't really my cup of tea. If you like YA romance though, it might be good for you.<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br />\\"There are three question every woman should be able to answer yes to before they commit to a man: 1. Does he treat you with respect at all times? 2. If he is the exact same person twenty years from now that he is today, would you still want to marry him? 3. Does he inspire you to want to be a better person?\\"

B0000AQS0F|5.0|\\"Firefly\\" the television series is many things: western space opera; political action adventure; pure escapism entertainment.  While all of these things make this series a huge blast to watch the center pole of the series is Nathan Fillion's (of \\"Castle\\" fame) Captain Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Reynolds.  As captain of the eponymous ship he crews eight other significant members who are each very well developed over the series and, as important, are a reflection of the different sides of the man who is Mal.<br /><br />First officer Zoe Washburne (played by Gina Torres) is a confederate of Mal's, a fellow browncoat, who fought the good rebel fight along with him and lost the battle but the fight lives on.  She represents Mal's fighting spirit and his notion that, no matter how bleak the future looks, you look it right square in the eyes and stare it down.  She also represents his idealism.<br /><br />Pilot extraordinaire Hoban \\"Wash\\" Washburne (played by underrated actor Alan Tudyk) is a lighter slice of life, married to Zoe and always ready to see the world through a \\"this is sorta ridiculous\\" lense.  He represents Mal's muted ability and desire to relax, to rest.<br /><br />Courtesan Inara Serra (played by dropdead gorgeous Morena Baccarin of recent \\"V\\" fame) is a complicated love interest of Mal's.  He's torn by her work (a high class space prostitute essentially) and she's torn by his stoicism and his love for his ship and crew versus herself.  She's a worldly, politically savvy individual and she represents Mal's eroticism and his philanthropic love.  He would go to the ends of the universe for Inara though he would rarely admit this to her.<br /><br />Jayne Cobb (played by the Baldwin known as Adam--check him out in the old classic \\"My Bodyguard\\"--he looks virtually the same 20 years later!) is the immoral, selfish, and brutish grunt of the crew.  He just might sell any or all of them out for a big enough paycheck...or to save his own hide.  He represents Mal's raw aggression and desire to overcome his obstacles by virtue of force, if not by will.<br /><br />Firefly's technical and mechanical expertise is found in Kaylee Frye (played by youthful Jewel Staite), who is practically at one with her ship and can fix just about any of its maladies.  She is also a wide-eyed innocent, a newly blooming flower, taking in the world around her as it comes and believing the best about people.  She represents Mal's purity.<br /><br />The enigmatic Shepherd Book (played by character actor Ron Glass) brings a little >ahem&lt; color to the all-white cast in more ways than one.  He is the saint among the sinners but the more we know the more we know that he hasn't always been a saint.  He is also the sage, able to dispense wordly and spiritual advice, and he repeatedly challenges Mal to look outside of himself to the bigger picture and to Firefly's version of \\"God\\" (not well developed but seemingly close to a Judeo-Christian representation).  Shepherd represents Mal's godly qualities, of being a Moses/ shepherd to his crew, and also to his spiritual nature (tamped down and ground into the dirt as it is) and even doing God's work in spite of himself.<br /><br />Dr. Simon Tam (played by Sean Maher) comes aboard with his sister, River Tam (played by balletic Summer Glau), in his bid to help his brain-scrambled living-weapon sister away from the intergalactic ruling authority of \\"The Alliance\\" who has been experimenting on her and turning her into some sort of super weapon.  Simon is fierce, righteously opinionated, and loyal to a fault toward his sister.  River is a glyph, a human key to the masked potentials of human feats (both mental and physical) as well as a fractured, tortured soul.  (Her storyline is the most distressing and maudlin of the series and threatens to bring the series down a notch at times unfortunately.)  As a family unit they represent Mal's sense of family and as him being a father figure.  Individually, Dr. Tam represents Mal's single-minded determination.  River represents Mal's untapped potential and belief (along with Shepherd Book) in things greater than himself.<br /><br />It is quite the compelling character study and this cast of seemingly disparate characters all resonate and coalesce within the centrifuge that is Mal.  Great, dynamic, excitinga and well-written series.  If you haven't seen it do yourself a favor and check it out soon.inded determination.

When I was told there was an assessment to be taken, I was intrigued. After seeing the results, my mind was blown, to say the least.<br /><br />I understand that the summary of your strengths is general and is given to anyone who is deemed to have that strength. However, after seeing how my strengths interact and play off of each other, I began to see things differently. I always knew in the back of my mind that I had these strengths, but seeing them on paper helped to confirm what I had been already thinking.<br /><br />This book helps to identify you by telling you your greatest strengths. It separates you from the rest of the pack and will help you in any future endeavor.<br /><br />Though you can only use the code once, you still have the book that explains your strengths. You can also buy the code at a future date in order to reassess yourself.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!

B00457X7XQ|4.0|After reading the synopsis I thought this would be an exciting read. Although it was a good book, it wasn't as exciting as I had hoped for. The exciting things that are mentioned in the synopsis are in the first few, and very short, chapters; then the rest of the book is the protagonist trying to decrypt code and stop the virus while the antagonist and his group try to keep on schedule of bringing down Western civilization. It isn't a bad book, but I did not get hooked on it as I had hoped. The characters are well-crafted and the story isn't bad...but it just wasn't as thrilling as it could have been. I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars, so this rating is pretty much a three and a half.

B0012TWRAO|3.0|I ordered this last minute ahead of doing a fly & ride for a new bike.  It arrived, it looked fine at first, then I noticed the flaking finish.  Not a huge issue, since it was cheap, but it simply doesn't look great and the finish flakes off.  It works though, that's what's important, I suppose.  Although, if you have tapered bars, it might slip down the taper and loosen up on you.

0307887448|4.0|Ready Player One technically has a very specific ideal target audience -- aficionados of 80s culture who are fans of video games and dystopian-sci-fi lit.  Being born in the late 1980s, I didn't quite fall into the ideal audience.  However, I am a fan of video games, dystopian/sci-fi, and clever books.  Thus, I found Ready Player One to be an enjoyable joyride.  In Cline's futuristic world, video games and social media and escapism have collided to bring the world the \\"OASIS.\\"  The OASIS is everything:  a game, the internet, social networking, school, the world's biggest public library containing just about every piece of writing, music, or video, there for the taking.  It is also an escape, a world that isn't crumbling while the real world outside falls to pieces.  It is being threatened by the IOI, a corporate entity that wants to take the virtual utopia and monetize it so only the rich can afford to utilize it.<br /><br />I found the dichotomies present in Ready Player One to be quite interesting.  While it is clear that Cline set out to make a dystopia where people would rather spend their time in a perfect, fake world than fix their real one, I found certain elements of the story quite optimistic.  For instance, that users with no money, like the protagonist, could access every book ever written, every song ever listened to, and every video ever watched.  In our day and age of extremists against freedom of information, of Big Hollywood pushing laws like SOPA and CISPA ever closer to passing, of pundits who act like online piracy will be the downfall of civilization as we know it...  Well that right there would very nearly make me willing to live in Cline's world, because I think we are headed in the complete opposite direction of such  free culture.  In the same vein, I have a hard time believing that file-sharing programs will be around, like the Guntorrent Wade mentions.<br /><br />Getting off the soapbox on that controversial point, I bring up another thing I doubt our culture will have sense enough to  hold onto:  privacy.  I feel it is overtly optimistic to the point of absurdism to believe that in 32 years, there will ever be such a degree of privacy where the company running the OASIS wouldn't even be able to look up an avatar's true identity.  Again, we're headed in the opposite direction.  We don't even have this degree of freedom right now, and I doubt the Supreme Court is going to change for the better in the future.<br /><br />However, it is clear that the society Cline has created is deeply flawed.  Little to no human interaction occurs in this world.  Humanity spends all of its collective free time in the OASIS.  Society has shifted to cater to this -- ways to allow people to never have the leave their rooms; new systems to make the OASIS seem more real than reality (\\"The real world looked washed-out and blurry by comparison.\\")  Elections in the OASIS come to matter more than the government's.  The economy is now based on a credits system that the OASIS uses.  Instead of living in the real world and taking a break in the OASIS, people live in the OASIS and feel that any breaks to reality are forced and undesired.  Such a society cannot continue on as such indefinitely.<br /><br />Overall, I greatly enjoyed Ready Player One.  The writing was entertaining, humorous, and poignant in all the right places.  Cline's voice speaks not only to those who are fans of the 80s culture the hunt revolves around, but to current internet users, video game players, and people who are concerned about the way our society is headed.  The events in the OASIS are action-packed, but Cline doesn't let the events in the real-world fall flat, either.  The world he has built, both the real and virtual sides, is immensely interesting.  The characters are also quirky and well-developed, adding much to the story.  If anything about the premise of Ready Player One appeals to you, I'd encourage you to pick it up.  It's a fun novel, with messages that speak to you long after you've put it down.sages that speak to you long after you've put it down.
0393088774|4.0|I must be a damned genius because I have been thinking the same things that Krugman discusses in this book for the last 3 years.  Krugman presents in a logical and very readable form the argument that monetary intervention in economic down turns works and that an attack on the deficit in such times is a red herring and counter productive.<br />I am conscious of the fact that people (including myself) tend to accept ideas that reinforce their preconceptions and reject those that don't so I have searched for an equally lucid rebuttal or authoritative explanation of how the Republican proposals would solve the current situation.  My  search has been in vain. After rejecting out of hand the banality of Glenn Beck and Ann Coulter and enumerable vitriolic personal attacks on Obama I am left with only a few self serving ideological discourses that have little relationship to reality.<br /><br />Surely Krugman's proposals are not 100% correct and virtually impossible to implement in today's political climate but how am I to know where the truth lies when the rebuttals are ideological claptrap? .
B007SYWFRM|5.0|First off, to exit this game you just click &quot;STUFF&quot;. The bottom bar will then show and you can exit. Seriously, why don't you try and look for a way to get out instead of just rating it one star and saying that you cannot get out? I haven't spent a single dollar yet since everything is so easy to get! Get this app, it's really fun!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play this game so much, I have to charge my kindle almost every day. Well, I play it in between reading and poking around on the internet. My granddaughter even likes to help me play.
030758836X|5.0|I was hooked from the first page! I even read this book at 3:00AM while trying to calm my newborn granddaughter and read it by the oven light so as not to disturb her. I had nightmares and in those thought I had the ending figured out. Was I ever wrong!<br /><br />The only thing that was disappointing to me was the ending. I would have liked it to be nice and tidy, but the ride up to it was worth every minute!

B007L6VR6M|5.0|It is something of a challenge to write a review of a Wes Anderson film. How do you explain a film where the soundtrack includes pieces by Hank Williams and Benjamin Britten and yet they both fit perfectly?  Everything about Anderson's style is so unique, from the way the visual shots are composed and the way the dialogue is written to the way the actors deliver the dialogue, not to mention the myriad odd little background details that are worked in throughout.  It's almost impossible to simply describe the film and still do it proper justice.  The best I can really say about Moonrise Kingdom is that it's arguably the ultimate Wes Anderson film, his masterpiece at least to date. And I say that as someone who isn't - or at least wasn't prior to this film - a particular fan of his work.<br /><br />Written by Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola, Moonrise Kingdom takes place in the summer of 1965 on an island off the coast of New England, where two twelve-year-old misfits - Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) run off together into the wilderness because they've fallen in love.  In flashback, we learn that Sam, an orphan who's a member of Khaki Scout Troop 55, which has its summer camp every year on the island, and Suzy, whose utterly dysfunctional family has a summer house on the island, met the previous summer and felt an instant affinity for each other, which resulted in their corresponding over the year and hatching a plan to run away together when the two of them would again be on the island the following summer.  When they meet up, each brings what they think they'll need to survive.  Sam brings camping equipment; Suzy brings six books, her cat, and a portable record player.<br /><br />A search begins for the two runaways when their respective adults notice they're missing.  In the case of Sam, this is Scout Master Randy Ward (Edward Norton), and in Suzy's case, her lawyer parents, Walt Bishop (Bill Murray) and Laura Bishop (Frances McDormand) , who in turn call in the island's local police chief, Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), who we subsequently learn has been having a long-term affair with Laura that both realize is hopeless but neither has the strength to walk away from.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any more about the plot as a lot of the enjoyment of a Wes Anderson film is simply watching things unfold in delightful, unexpected and sometimes simply weird ways, and Moonrise Kingdom is no exception.  I will say that the ending was perfectly written and executed, bringing a number of plot threads and themes together in ways that you'll truly have to experience to appreciate.  If nothing else, Moonrise Kingdom truly merits an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.  The dialogue, the originality and the way in which the themes are developed in in which all of the intricate elements are tied together as the story plays out is truly a work of art. Not to mention all of the myriad little cultural cues and references worked into the visuals and the dialogue, from the more obvious ones like Noah's Ark and Peter Pan to the more obscure like Chief Joseph and the Flight of the Nez Perce.<br /><br />The performances are all top-notch, to the point that it's difficult to single out any one as being superior to the rest. Newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward turn in particularly deft performances as Sam and Suzy, more than able to carry the film's center as events swirl around them. Bruce Willis does a particularly nuanced job as the island's police chief, trying to do the right thing by the two runaways even when he can't manage to do it for himself, his eyes and his pauses delivering volumes about the things he doesn't say.  Bill Murray's Walt is a bleakly comic mix of bluster and despair, while Frances McDormand's Laura runs the family show, herding her kids around with a bull-horn (something apparently Anderson's mother actually did). Edward Norton's Scout Master Randy goes through one of the film's more interesting evolutions as events lead him out of his comfort zone of structure and order into swirling chaos and eventually to surprising self-discovery.  The boys who make up the rest of the Khaki Scouts in Troop 55 make an excellent supporting group-think character, as do the boys who play Suzy's three younger brothers.  In addition to the cast already mentioned, other notable actors who show up are Bob Balaban as the film's on-screen Narrator (who is also apparently the island's local historian and who gives a bizarre visual impression of having been one of Santa's elves in a past life), Jason Schwartzman as one of the scout's Cousin Ben, Harvey Keitel as Khaki Scout Commander Pierce, and Tilda Swinton as \\"Social Services\\" (it's one of the running jokes in the film).<br /><br />A lot of themes run through Moonrise Kingdom, particularly with regard to the question of whether there is any real difference between adults and children.  The adults in Moonrise Kingdom all experience private feelings of inadequacy in their roles as adults, and in fact act like children in their dealings with each other, but maintain the pretense nonetheless in the presence of the 'real' children.  The children in turn act like little versions of the adults, the only difference being that they're not yet aware of their inadequacies and hence do not feel inhibited by them.  A lot of this is played out in the dialogue and the way the actors deliver it, maintaining an even consistency in the level of vocabulary and in the rhythm of delivery, whether the words are coming from an adult or a kid, further erasing the boundaries we generally use to distinguish between the two.  The adults sound like the children and the children sound like the adults, but without the doubts.<br /><br />There are a number of memorable scenes in the movie, many humorous but some surprising in how they speak again to the issues of whether there really is any difference between adulthood and childhood.  And in the inadequacies adults feel in their roles as adults.  One of my favorites is a moment where Walt and Laura are lying awake in their summer house, unable to sleep with the two kids missing and the sound of the approaching storm beginning to rise outside. As they stare at the ceiling, Walt, in a moment of despondent candor, says \\"I hope the roof flies off and sucks me into space.\\"  When Laura reminds him \\"We're all they've got,\\" Walt replies simply but tellingly \\"It's not enough.\\"  Another great scene occurs when the other Scouts in the troop go searching for Sam, but only after arming themselves with every weapon they can find or make. It's darkly comic and appalling at the same time when you realize that the boys are just mimicking what they think adults are like.<br /><br />On a side note, the books in the film that Suzy takes with her - and from which she reads to Sam and to the other Scouts - are completely fictitious.  Or at least they were.  Anderson commissioned six artists to create jacket covers for the books, and then he wrote the passages for each of the books that Suzy ends up reading aloud. Anderson had considered creating animated segments to accompany the reading scenes, but in the end he chose instead to just have Suzy reading with the boys listening enraptured. After the film was completed and released though, Anderson decided to animate all six books and use assemble them in a video in which Bob Balaban, acting against as narrator, introduces the segment for each of the books.  This video may appear in the DVD/Blu-ray release as bonus material.<br /><br />All in all, I would highly recommend Moonrise Kingdom, both to fans of Wes Anderson as his best film to date, and to anyone else who enjoys quirky but highly engaging story-telling with masterful attention to every detail and fine performances by an extremely talented cast of actors.he film's more interesting evolutions as events lead him out of his comfort zone of structure and order into swirling chaos and eventually to surprising self-discovery.

1591841666|4.0|When do you quit and when do you decide to stick it out? These are the real questions facing people in business, employees and entrepreneurs. In The Dip, Seth Godin explains that the most successful people are those who are able to get out from the dead end situation fast. Nevertheless, Godin asserts that it is not just about coming out; it is also about staying motivated when the situation calls for it.<br /><br />I like the concepts illustrated here, this has to be one of Godin's best books. I took away the assertion that: winners quit fast, often and with no guilt, while losers stick in the same position even when they know it is not working. To me, this book is about change as it is about staying focused. It does not call for people to just quit, but it calls for deeper assessment of what you are doing now and its potential.<br /><br />This book is for everyone, whether you are an employee, a sales rep, an executive, entrepreneur or student. It is easy to think that the book advocates for quitting if you are not number one at something. However, I think the point here is continuous self-assessment and assessment of the worth of your projects.
B004Q7CIFI|3.0|If you love imagination, go for it. To get to Kennedy part a lot of background has to be read.  Moving back time in time is discussed with surprising results. Only the last part of the book directly discusses the assassination.  Multiple plots lines enhance the novel.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I believe this is the best season in the SoA series. I would recommend purchasing these episodes to any SoA fan.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|The Vampire Diaries is an amazing show. I watch it whenever it comes on tv, even though I own the 1st and 2nd seasons on dvd. I also plan on buying the 3rd season when it comes out. I rewatch this series over and over. I never get tired of it. It continues to grow and get better. A lot of people either like this or True Blood. I love them both. I don't compare them at all. They are both great shows, but they are very different. So if you don't like True Blood, don't let that keep you from watching The Vampire Dairies. Beautiful women and beautiful men!! No reason not to watch!! I watch it with my mom every thursday night!!

The suspense is amazing and you are always learning new information. Every episode has new evidence, it really keeps you on your toes. It has drama and relationships, but that isn't the main point of the show. It is just part of it. I will watch it until the end. I want to know what happened to Alison. Everyone should watch this if they like suspense.

B004EPYZQ2|1.0|Well, I took a chance on it and my instincts were right. This is Spielberg trying so hard to get the freshness of ET and the creativity of \\"Amazing Stories\\" . It's a mish-mosh combination that goes off the rails.<br /><br />The film actually starts off producing mild interest for the first twenty five minutes. Some annoying half teen/half something else kids of 1979 suburbia are working on making a home style movie. That's about the only part that held my interest because I had done the same as a youngster, but after the big train wreck, this monstrosity goes on and on with noise and nonsense. The kids get caught up in some military generated creature bs (or restrained alien- who knows) that plays out like a far fetched kiddie film. Most movies generate improbability, but this film throws in the kitchen sink and more as it scrambles for high octane interest.<br /><br />The creature is so wicked and destructive that no one in their right mind, let alone a kid, would want to come near the thing. The CGI seems old school and detracts as the monster who is wisely hidden with glimpses reveals itself. Of course one pre- teen boy can stop this fiend in it's tracks with vocal civility. Sub plots including a weirdly displayed kid crush and conflicting dads fall flat all around. Remove the sci -fi aspect and you have big screen Hallmark movie. A concoction of metal, lights and crud is whipped up to create an excuse of an ending. It couldn't come fast enough for this dud.

B002I9Z8DK|2.0|Star Trek is important to me, so much that it's hurts to give a poor review of the final film in the series. I literally cringed listening to some of the awkward dialogue. The film was meaninglessly slow. The action scenes were limited and looked overtly staged. This was the one Star Trek film that really came across like a big floppy TV episode. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home ended the series for this fan.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|Read all three of Ms. Flynn's books before offering a review, liked all of them, but they are dark, dark.  Bring a flashlight!<br />No claim being made here of being a literary expert, but written dialog that doesn't feel canned is difficult.  Few authors, IMHO do it well.  Ms. Flynn is one of them who does it well.  A good (albeit a little disturbing) read.

He said it just wasn't played like other versions and it could have been WAY better.  The rest of the performances made up for that somewhat.<br /><br />I think we can all agree that when we buy something for one main reason, and that reason turns out to suck, it's a disappointing purchase all around, no matter what the other features are.

I have known many people who cannot tolerate reading an entire book yet have read and enjoyed this one.  This book has turned fans of other genres into die-hard Sci-fi fans.<br /><br />Normally when I read a book, I can only think of one or two people to recommend it to.  However, I raved about this book to everyone I knew.  It was so exciting and addicting that I have read every book in the series.  This one is the best in the series and quite possibly in its genre.

B004CLYKLI|4.0|I finally got around to reading this book.  I think I gave myself enough breathing room between when the hype and controversy began and when I actually started to read.<br /><br />The first half of the book is a very quick read.  She is candid, witty, relatable, sarcastic, and hilarious (well... hilarious as long as you catch her sarcasm. I have a similar communication style so i appreciated the subtle self-deprecation).  It's true that she does make some sweeping generalizations, but she made them obvious and I think she was intentional only to make a point.<br /><br />She writes some truths.  While I may not agree on how she executes them, I appreciate some of the philosophies she shares.  For example, the idea that not allowing your children to give up when the get frustrated shows your confidence in their abilities (even if they don't understand that yet) and allows them to realize their own potential. Or learning how it feels to overcome a hurdle through hard work or perseverance and how it helps them to bolster their own self-confidence.  She expresses it more eloquently, but that's the gist.<br /><br />For those who are terribly insulted, she is just one person writing her experience. She is not writing an instructional book. She is not claiming to speak for all Chinese parents.  While it may seem that she is, she actually never writes much about others who share her style or view and more people who oppose it, even her own parents.<br /><br />The downfall of the book is that she loses steam toward the end and starts to ramble a bit.  I think she wanted to get the book finished and published before she really knew how she was going to end it, and she couldn't afford to wait until she knew what her point was.  That shows in her final 25% or so of the book.<br /><br />However, the first 75% is great. It is definitely worth a read, especially if you have immigrant parents or suspect that you have tiger tendencies.

The story line is straight forward and simple, yet very touching and interesting.<br />Whether you're a companion animal's person or not, even if you're a cat person, you most likely will love this book.<br />We humans need to take the place of non human animals surrounding us in order to understand them, what it's like to be like them, what they could think and feel about us... And \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is a perfect way to do so. I liked it very much and would definitively recommend it to anybody with closed eyes!

006197806X|5.0|Wow, that was something.<br />I had really high expectations for Pandemonium, and they were definitely met. It wasn't what I expected whatsoever, but that's okay. It was amazing and worth it and the dang cliffhanger has me crying inside. I can't wait for the next book. AT ALL. What will I do with my life??<br />Anyway, the way Lauren Oliver set up the chapters really piqued my interest. At first, I admit I was confused, but after two or three sets of \\"Now\\" and \\"Then\\" it was simple to follow. The \\"Then\\" helped explain and even occasionally \\"foreshadowed\\" what would happen in the \\"Now\\". The writing itself was, of course, great. I had no worries when I first started because I know Oliver is an amazing writer. You can really feel the emotions that Lena is going through because of how the sentences are structured.<br />The characters- oh my goodness. Lena went from being a soft, follow-the-rules type to a complete badass. She went undercover knowing the danger and trudged through the forest after \\"losing\\" the love of her life. Love her. Julian, without giving too much away, is also a great character. I love how he developed throughout the story. At first, I didn't think I'd like him. He seemed wimpy, but he definitely grew on me. Raven is way more badass than Lena, she's amazing. She's caring, brave, and even though she made some wrong decisions, in the end she corrected them.<br />The plot got intense. The way it changed from then to now switched it up a bit- I loved it. All of the new settings were great too- NYC and the other homesteads, the hospital, the tunnels. Fantastic.<br />I CANNOT wait for the next book. The cliffhanger left me begging for more. I just kept reading that last page over and over, not believing it was true. I was heartbroken and depressed yet happy and ecstatic; it was just.. I can't even explain it. If you haven't read the book yet, it is in your best interest to do it. Now preferably. ;)<br />5/5 hands down.

I am a middle aged woman who actually liked Twilight a lot, though I understand how it got a lot of critics going over it, but I knew it was young adult fantasy.<br /><br />This... this thing called a book...  I just do NOT get it. I HAD to stop reading. If I read her inner goddess one more time I think I'd throw up. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!<br /><br />I cannot imagine a grownup, teenager or some who is even into this kind of non vanilla sex finding any redeeming qualities here. It needs someone to edit it first of all. Using the same phrase over and over, things that even a silly teenager would roll their eyes at and laugh about no doubt...<br /><br />I know one is supposed to suspend belief, it's fiction, fantasy, but it's just so downright irritating, I don't get the buzz over it. Buy at your own risk..I'll read some Emily Giffen or someone who knows how to write over this any day.<br /><br />If I want to be spanked or otherwise dominated, I'll find a real book about that. Crazy crazy... I can't believe the drivel that trends so hotly sometimes.

B0028RXXFC|3.0|I'm disappointed with this blue ray dvd set as there is too much edited or deleted parts. Same goes with a couple of blue ray disc like Lock up, and Rambo 2. I always thought that original from US should not have unnecessary edited parts not to mention its a blue ray. If I keep on receiving edited disc i might as well get from a local source ..cheaper too. Don't have to wait.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Got this as FAOTD a while back but instantly deleted because my kindle fire was being dumb and I couldnt add more pics to it. Anyway Ive recently been haunted by all the pic apps such as instagram and wanted to try something similar and discovered that I already own this one.<br /> Playing around with it I saw not only is it easy to get a photo from the gallery to play with but that I can download straight from my facebook which has thousands of my pics so I dont need to download then edit then upload anymore so that was a big plus for me.Then I can save right back to my account.<br />Me and my daughter play around with it now and I like it enough to let it take up my app space. I still havent played around with everything but I do not see any collage frames but I could just save a collage to the gallery then edit it with this.<br /><br />When you touch the title of the app it allows you to choose from a small amount of colors to change the background and title colors no big deal but its always nice to be able to personalize little things like that imo. Also when you save a creation it says it has been added to your film roll. I looked around in the app but didnt find a film roll. I exited the app and looked in the gallery and it was saved there.<br />I think I will have lots more fun with this app though, once I upgrade to a more feature rich tablet

030758836X|2.0|If Lifetime movies became books, this one would be a shoe in!<br /><br />Within minutes of reading, I was engulfed with the two characters of the book. It was indeed a page turner that kept me engaged and intrigued. However, halfway into the book, either the author got tired or she simply ran out of ideas because not only did it become ridiculously predictable, it became downright corny!<br /><br />I only finished it just because I simply couldn't believe the storyline could get any worse...yet it did!!! What started out as a witty, interesting story slowly turned into a overwritten Latin-like soap opera. The last 50 pages or so were gut-wrenching boring! However, I will say the author is very talented and effectively uses the dictionary to express herself very colorfully!!

1580176941|5.0|I bake sugar cookies as a hobby, on many holidays & occasions. I've recently been asked to bake cookies as party favors & things. I am in no way shape or form a professional, but it is indeed something I'm passionate about. The recipe I use is right from this book. Though the book only contains four recipes, they are all equally delicious! The book is mostly baking & decorating tips, all of which I've found incredibly useful. I get amazing reviews on my cookies every time!<br /><br />The only tip I can suggest to you is not about the book itself, but your baking procedure. If you're making rolled sugar cookies with cookie cutters, I use about a half a cup to a cup less of flour than the recipe calls for (depending on if I'm doubling or even tripling the recipe). If you're like me, when you roll the cookies, you use TONS of flour. If you cut some out of the recipe, it doesn't take away from the cookies when you add more flour when rolling. The dough also doesn't get as flaky as quickly by doing this.<br /><br />Happy baking! :)

B000LN7HUC|5.0|I have to say, what a wonderful piece of kit this is. I needed something to replace carrying my whisperlite international around when I only need to cook for my self. the whole kit, with 12oz of fuel on me is still lighter then trusty whisperlite and its needed items. I only wish it came with a cup of some sort or a second pot to use as a mug instead of the frying pan lid, thats just a wish list. I works flawlessly, burns almost any alcohol you can find. Its small, durable, very light weight; and is dead easy to use and set up.<br /><br />If you looking to drop weight and complexity in your camp stove, then this is the one to get.<br /><br />On a side note. I took it with three people on a 3 day trip, and only used up less than 10oz of fuel heating up water for mountain house style meals in 3 days, and that's with me making coffee every morning, and a couple nights.

B00004CNHC|4.0|Either you enjoy Barbara Streisand's singing or you don't. I don't. That is the reason I wasn't particularly eager to see Hello Dolly. Then I found a copy of it on vhs at a yard sale and figured \\"eh,why not?\\". After all, I have seen a number of actors who I ordinarily do not care for give what I consider to be excellent performances.<br />  Well,this is not one of those performances. There is nothing about Streisand's singing or acting that I liked. Luckily,I liked just about everything else about the film. All the other actors were delightful. Some of the songs were hilarious,and I enjoyed Gower Champion's silly,energetic choreography (which is no surprise considering that I loved his dancing in Show Boat). The film is upbeat and few of the jokes fail to elicit a chuckle. It doesn't take itself too seriously and that is what makes the absurdity of the plot work. Honestly,the lead is pretty much the only low point in my mind. What saves the film for me is that many scenes have little or nothing to do with Dolly. I do not know who I would prefer in the lead role,although it probably would not be Channing.<br />  I liked the film so well,I plan to buy it on dvd and possibly make watching it a summer tradition. I am disappointed that the dvd has few extras and no commentary,but I will likely buy it anyway. I just can't help but imagine how much more I would love the film if I actually enjoyed Dolly herself.

B001UV4XHY|1.0|A copy of \\"Tangled\\" was in our DVD box. Unfortunately, the entire extended family was on vacation and our evening were to be spent in a Harry Potter marathon. This development is unfortunate and compounded by the fact that Amazon cannot replace the DVD as it did not fulfill it in the first place. The whole process is a drag and complete disappointment. Find another source for this particular DVD.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|After watching this film the first time, I wasn't quite sure what to think of it. I knew it wasn't a bad film, but at the same time it just didn't sit right with me for whatever reason. So I went back and watched Begins and TDK and I think I figured out why I didn't really care for it. In my opinion it doesn't seem to fit with the other two films.<br /><br />Warning: Some spoilers<br /><br />First there's the setting. The concept of a broken and retired Batman living as a recluse is interesting, but it seems to sort of contradict what we saw in the other films. We learn that he hasn't been Batman for 8 years since Dent was killed, which made me wonder, why is he in such bad physical shape then? Rewatching The Dark Knight, I didn't see anything to show where these injuries came from. Why is his leg screwed up? The last scene of Dark Knight was him running away from the camera. If he hasn't been Batman since then and has been living like a hermit, how did he screw up his leg? Also, why did he stop being Batman? Rises seems to suggest it was stress over Rachel, although that happened midway through The Dark Knight and didn't seem to stop him. He sort of suggested at the end of Dark Knight that since Dent died, he had to be the hero. That was sort of the point of Dark Knight that Gotham's savior had to be either Dent or Batman and since Dent died, it had to be Batman, but then Rises suggests that Batman just kinda went home literally right after that. Rises sort of gets around this by introducing what I consider to be a highly implausible \\"Dent Act\\" in honor of Harvey Dent, in which all of Gotham's criminals are apparently just straight locked up with no sort of legal due process, the streets become clean as a whistle, and Batman \\"isn't needed anymore\\". The Dent Act also asks you to believe that everyone now believes without a question that Batman killed Harvey Dent, despite having saved him very publicly from the Joker in Dark Knight. I find it strange that things likethis are considered realistic, yet more cat features on catwoman's suit are not. Anyways..<br /><br />Second, the villains. I found Bane to be just plain underwhelming. Physically intimidating sure, but I felt like they had to seriously water down Batman's competence in order to artificially make Bane more threatening. In Begins and Dark Knight Batman would fight using his surroundings. That's basically how he fights, something he learned from the League of Shadows and Ras Al Ghul. \\"Always mind your surroundings.\\" Yet when confronted with Bane and reminded of the League, Batman simply charges at him swinging like a brawler. No tech, no using the environment around him, just straight fisticuffs. I realize that he's been \\"retired\\" for 8 years, but again, that felt forced and unexplained as I mentioned in my first point, which just reinforces my belief that this was done simply to make Bane seem more threatening. As for Talia, she just felt too much like Ras, and a lesser version at that. Not only does she not get the character development that Ras got to make him interesting, but in the end she's only doing it to carry out Ras' will, which just made her feel like a pawn. The main villian and she doesn't even have her own plan. Overall they felt too similar to the Begins villians. In Begins the villains worked within the system, using it to try to destroy Gotham. In Dark Knight the villains worked to try to destroy the system and induce chaos in Gotham. In Rises, I was expecting another progression to give the villains an overall theme to work with, but it just feels the same as Begins. Talia manipulating the system to try and destroy Gotham.<br /><br />Third, not enough Batman. Having Bruce trapped in a pit for the better part of the film's second half served no purpose imo. I don't think anybody thought that he wasn't going to escape this pit and return to face Bane. I realize this sort of had to happen based on what we know of Bane and Batman in the comics, but theway it was handled only served to take us away from Gotham and Bane where things were getting interesting, and into a dull situation miles away in which we already know the only possible outcome. Obviously the movie won't end with \\"And then Batman died in the pit\\" It employs odd and often confusing time jumps that the previous films didn't have, taking away from the pacing and making the film feel frantic. Once Bane starts implementing his plan and things start to pick up, there's literally a 5 month time skip that glosses over Gotham transitioning from normal society to anarchist warzone in favor of Bruce's previously mentioned antics in the pit.<br /><br />Warning: Spoilers!!!!!!<br /><br />Fourth, John Blake. I liked the character and portrayal but I felt the \\"big reveal\\" about him at the end was totally unnecessary and handled in the worst possible way. First off... his actual legal name is Robin? ....... I'll leave that at that, but what bothered me more about how this was handled is that again, this doesn't seem to be consistent with the previous films. In Rises we get Bruce spouting a bunch of nonsense about how Batman was supposed to inspire people into action and that \\"anybody can be Batman\\" Oh really? What about those guys in The Dark Knight who were trying to help Batman take down Scarecrow and some drug dealers? They tried to be Batman and Bruce responded by kicking the living cr@p out of them, breaking all their weapons and then making fun of their outfits. They did exactly what he's talking about in Rises and he personally beat them up for it. Just seems weird is all..  Also, how did Blake know Bruce was Batman? You can assume that since he's a cop he could've done the detective work and figured this out, but he doesn't say that's what happened. He says he literally figured it out by having met Bruce once a long time ago and recognizing he had the same hidden pain that Blake had from losing his parents? Really?! That's it?! How can you reasonably makesuch a huge assumption based on meeting someone once and looking at their face?<br /><br />Fifth, Catwoman. Again, nothing wrong with the performance, but I felt her character was unneeded. Nothing she did in the film seemed to matter, except of course for the fact that they decided to let her be the one to kill Bane. The romance between them felt forced as well imo. I don't see why he would be attracted to her. Her ideology is almost the direct opposite of his. In the comics there's a sense that she genuinely cares about him and a lot of that is due to their long history, none of which we get to see here. I never really get the sense that she saw him as anything other than a 1 percenter or necessarily cared about his well being. When Bane \\"breaks\\" him, she doesn't seem concerned about him, just concerned about what Bane will do to the city and how it will effect her. It's all about her and I just don't really see what draws him to her in this film.<br /><br />Finally, the ending. I get it, he retired. Batman gets to live a happy life in Europe or whatever with Catwoman. Great for him I guess, but isn't Gotham gonna be worse than ever now? Gordon will likely lose his job as commissioner because of his 8 year lie to the public and for knowingly framing Batman for Dent's murder. Dent has been revealed as a murderer, meaning the Dent Act will likely be repealed and all these criminals are gonna come pouring back to the streets, including Joker, who isn't dead and who happens to be the direct cause of almost everything that happens in Rises to begin with. I get that they can't use Ledger anymore, but I for one found it strange that they deliberately chose not to once mention the Joker even though nothing in Rises would be as it is without him.<br /><br />And who's left behind in Gotham to handle this new mess? \\"Robin\\" John Blake, a man who now has Bruce's suit and gadgets, sure, but none of the League of Shadows training that would let you take on dozens of thugs/SWATofficers at a time, meaning the first time he suits up and hops down into a group of 5 guys thinking he's a bad@ss, he's gonna get wailed on. Bruce didn't even bother to train the guy like the real Robin. Not only that, but Bruce only met this guy what... twice, for a total of 10 minutes and he trusts him with the Batsuit? But I guess Bruce isn't concerned with any of that anyways. He's \\"moved on\\" and I should be happy that he doesn't have to be the hero and protector Gotham needs like we've come to expect from him over the course of this trilogy, right? I just feel like it sent a strange message where you should do what you feel is right but only until you're tired of it, then you should sit back and have some \\"me-time\\" with a foxy lady despite the fact that there's still more to be done. I dunno about you but that just struck me as not very admirable and as something no respectable version of Batman would EVER do...<br /><br />Overall the film is well acted and looks and sounds great, but it's only mildly entertaining and drags in a lot of places. I also felt it was the least realistic of the trilogy which I found unfortunate since the realism is what drew me to the trilogy in the first place. Things like the Dent Act, an old man in a pit who can heal a broken back by punching it, a usb drive that can erase your name from every computer on the planet and a cheesy imo nuclear bomb plot that emerges somewhat randomly near the end of the film serve to make it the most comic-booky feeling film of the three. All that said, again it's not a bad movie by any means and I'd say it's worth a watch, but it's easily the weakest of the trilogy in my opinion.

030758836X|4.0|So hard to review or rate this book.  I give it 3 1/2 stars.  Well-written, engaging, but the story is so \\"far-out\\" it leaves you with a sense of disappointment, almost outrage.  It's as if the<br />author sat down with the premise \\"what if...?\\" and tried to carry it as far as she<br />possibly could.  What you get is two characters who you cannot believe have much<br />resemblance to real people.  And they are so unlikeable do you care about them at<br />all, when everything is said and done?  What is Amy Elliott Dunne?  Is she a brilliant, \\"normal\\" woman who simply hates men and is obsessed with manipulating them and trumping them to get the last<br />laugh as her sole goal in life?  Or is she a sociopath masquerading as a normal \\"girl next door\\" type?  Nick is more believable as the wronged husband who committed his own mistakes, but is forced to live out his days with the preposterous consequences of being married to Amy in the first place.  The best part of this book is the author's pervasive grasp of a lot of the phoniness in relationships in our society, and her understanding of the hardships and stressors many married couples face. Sometimes I could hear myself thinking \\"wow, Gillian Flynn has nailed it\\".<br /><br />What I just couldn't believe is that Amy could get away with what she did or that the police didn't figure the whole thing out (or enough of it).  The author's glib narration of how Amy is able<br />to \\"handle\\" and bamboozle everyone is just too smooth, too easy, and makes the police appear as incompetents at best, or silly, cardboard characters at worst.  Other plot twists are just too convenient, and not consistent with Amy's intelligence and ability to control everything.  I think the book would have been more of a thriller if the author had withheld the main plot changer until much closer to the end of the book.  The actual ending was also strange, and a lead balloon.
0307592731|1.0|Not the greatest book at all.  But when the author wrote of her abortion as though it were an unimportant task on her list, I was appauled.  I imagine this was not her true experience, but it was unfortunate she chose to include it with such thoughtlessness.  I stopped reading at that point.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Hunger Games are a magnificent saga.  The books are better than the movie.  I highly reccomend this three book set. It is very hard to put it down.  An absolute bargain for the price payed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even though this series is \\"young adult fiction\\", I (a forty year-old) enjoyed these books. Very intense, I couldn't put these books down. The author really pulls you in and makes the reader feel part of the story. I was quite impressed with the underlying commentary of our times,i.e.,the destruction of our world's natural reasources; society's vulgar and inhumane obsession with reality tv; politics; war.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|It wasn't what I thought it was going to be.  The commercials may look great, hilarious, and amazing, but it's not at all what you expect.  It's crude throughout the whole thing, there's a cuss word every other word, and it just doesn't make you laugh all that much.  The commercials were literally the only parts that were good.

0375703861|3.0|I got this book on a recommendation that it would be a deep story. Now first off this is no easy undertaking (the subject matter, the look at immigrants and history), the story is to be applauded for that alone. I also feel that the book is definitely better than a lot of its contemporaries who try to tackle the same issue. That being said, I don't think this book is quite there. It's great and there are some moments of brilliance, and yet I don't think that the book managed to reach as far as I had hoped (there were times when it seemed oh so close, and yet in the end it didn't manage that). The story jumps from one POV to another, and this is done to give insight to the entire immigrant/native community in London. This seems to work for the most part, though it sometimes tends to, as some other reviewers have pointed out, make the characters flatter than they could have been. There are also times when they seem a little too flat, but that can be overlooked given the epic attempt the author tries to use them for.<br />And yet it could have been so much more... the ending comes out as contrived and forced, and I feel that there could have been more. The characters as well don't seem to have been used well enough to flesh out this history that the author wants to show us... In the end I would warn potential readers to consider what they expect from this book. If it's a look at immigrant life in London, it appears to accomplish this very well. If it's for some depth into that situation, then I would recommend looking elsewhere.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|nice and big.  great on kindle fire.  I use this app frequently.  a must have.  get it.  it is free.
0984725113|3.0|The first three chapters of this book are great.  The fourth and fifth are delusional.  Hence three out of five stars.<br /><br />The diagnosis of the problem of advancing technology, which is covered in the first three chapters, is persuasive.  It is welcome wake-up call, even if a belated one.  However the problem is not just change; there has always been change.  It is the speed of this change.<br /><br />What is remarkable is that the authors use a striking analogy, the second half of the chessboard, to illustrate the latter point, but then singularly fail to follow up on the implications of their own analysis.  Ray Kurzweill refers to a `knee point', a point where change suddenly dramatically alters its trajectory.  We are now well past the knee point with ICT and the disruption to existing economics and, one might add, ideas about economics, is coming down the track like an accelerating express train.<br /><br />Having made their point about the exponential speed of change (and with some force), what do the authors suggest?  A catalogue of well worn and highly debatable ideas (not to say hyperbole) about on-line education and a series of sometimes tinkering-at-the-edges policies that, even if you could get them through the political system in a reasonable time-frame, are not going to be anything like enough to solve the problems we already have, never mind those en route.<br /><br />One hates to invoke Charles Murray at a time like this, but maybe it is time to re-visit The Bell Curve.  Only a small fraction of the population are entrepreneurs and a larger, but still fairly modest fraction have the type of aptitudes and skills necessary to exploit ICT and set up a micromultinational in the way envisaged by the authors.  This type of windy thinking is worthy of Thomas Friedman at his most pompous.<br /><br />The almost manic cyber optimism at the end of the book is depressing because one would have expected something more measured not to say more radical. I amas much a technophile as anybody, but I do not kid myself that the problems of income inequality and distribution are going to be solved by changes in the education system, even if that could be done which seems increasingly improbable.<br /><br />It is not that the ideas here are bad; they are not.  America (and the world) would be a better place were all 19 of them to be implemented in the morning.  But they are not enough, not nearly enough.  We need to think a lot more deeply about this problem and well beyond the solutions proposed in this book.

Grammatically incorrect sentences, tortured writing, an even more tortured plot, cookie-cutter paper-thin characters, and a plot that moves so quickly you feel like you're in an MTV music video, except that music videos have better character development.

If your product got lots of feedback, feature requests, and showed promise for real growth (not due to PR stunts or other 'manipulative' practices -- see \\"Start with WHY\\" by Simon Sinek), then you know your product is actually wanted by the market and can continue development and assign appropriate resources.<br />->Actionable metrics (as opposed to vanity metrics): These are statistics that are useful to showing real promise for growth, rather than promoting a misleading image. Examples include retention, trial conversion rate, and referrals. A jump in downloads due to publicity stunt or increased advertising and marketing that drive downloads are NOT the basis for determining future growth. You will (possibly) stall out your growth and mislead yourself if you follow these metrics.<br /><br />In conclusion, I thought this book was all about saving money, which it kind of is. But it is more than that, more about building a sustainable business, promoting real growth based on actionable metrics, and implementing lean strategies into your business (large or small). It's a short read too; no excuse not to read it. Buy this book, and you won't regret it.short read too; no excuse not to read it. Buy this book, and you won't regret it.

B004MC0FO8|5.0|Remember that song you heard on that commercial? Or how about in the car with friends? Yeah, I've had so many songs that I wish I could've found before. So glad I finally got a cool phone with this app. I now expand my music collection daily. There's only one song it could not find for me so far - so if anyone is good with hip-hop/rap please msg me so I can find this one song!!!
B0086VWCPG|4.0|To be totally honest, this is the only running app. I've ever used, but I can't imagine another one suiting my needs any better. It's GPS function is great. Knowing the distance, split, and pace allows you to make adjustments in the middle of your run. A bonus for me is the Spanish voice. I lived for a while in Madrid and just love that the female voice Runtastic Pro uses has a Castillian accent! Very nostalgic.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool captivates you from the first short story, aptly called \\"Wool 1\\", where you are invited into a world where Order (and submission) reigns. The author does a fabulous job with developing the characters and their fixture in the story. The love interests in the series are rather stale compared to the other relationships that move the plot; caster & shadow, silver & blue, mayor & deputy. The lack of an excellent love story does not take away from the story, but adds another thick layer of melancholy that seems to linger throughout the series. The theme is in no way new, nor are the factions original, but the way in which they each at some point had my loyalty made the series more contemplating than to be expected; I was pretty adamant on what side I wanted to win in Harry Potter, in 1984, in WE, but I found a mixture of good from what the protagonists would describe as evil (and vice-versa).

0345803485|2.0|I really wanted to love this book but I sadly do not. I could barely finish the book. I have some friends who kept telling me I need to read this book and how wonderful it is, but it is far from wonderful. The book consists mostly of her biting her lip and rolling her eyes. the author also likes to throw in random words that most people need to look up in the dictionary. The characters are weak and the plot is a mess. I do not know anyone that would sign a contact that would allow themselves to be flogged or to be treated as an object. I do not know how this book is a best seller.

0425263908|4.0|I read Bared to You before 50 shades- and while waiting for the next one I needed a detour so I read the 50 shades series.  The books are a lot alike but writers pull from other writers all the time.  It is what it is.  I found Bared to You different in all the ways it needed to be different.  The relationship does not take the whole first book weighing the options of a BDSM contract and whether Gideon likes Eva or if he simply just wants this contract- it is almost like the good cute parts of the 1st book of 50 shades mixed with the beginning of 50 darker.  Gideon and Eva's relationship goes through the beginning rough patches and then beginning of the deeper aspects all in the first book.  I only wish I discovered this book later like I did 50 shades and was able to read all 3 straight instead of waiting... bc Mrs.Day set up some good stuff in the last few chapters. can't wait for #2.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me up at night.  I literally could not put it down.  The best kind of summer read.  A psychological thriller that had me drop-jawed numerous times.  There are some fine points in the mystery that someone could take issue with, but Ms. Flynn's writing-style had me at the first chapter, hook, line and sinker.  Everything a good summer vacation read should be . . .  and more.
0316017930|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell is an excellent writer, and as one reviewer said, he could write \\"The grass is green\\" in such a way that we'd say \\"Really? Who knew?\\"<br /><br />Outliers contains two main parts: The first is that those who succeed wildly are those who have practiced diligently for years and those who were blessed with the opportunities that allowed them to practice so many hours. What seems to an outsider as a \\"self made man\\" or an \\"overnight success\\" is really a combination of effort, diligence, good fortune, and opportunity. No one's an \\"overnight success.\\" They just seem that way to us because we weren't there every step of the way as they learned and practiced and improved. I found this section of the book most interesting and most useful.<br /><br />The second part is on legacy and its importance in the success of a person or group of people. Legacy here mean geography: For example, the Chinese are better at math in part because they originated from rice paddy farmers. I found this section less compelling, possibly because I found the evidence less convincing.<br /><br />Prior to reading Outliers, I finished [[ASIN:0345472322 Mindset: The New Psychology of Success]]. The two books go nicely together. Dr. Dweck's book says that there are two different kinds of people: Those with a fixed mindset (I'm good at X and I'm not good at Y) and those with a growth mindset (I'm not good at X yet, but I can improve with practice.) Mr. Gladwell's book says that in order to truly master something, a person needs to put in 10,000 hours. I think you'd need a growth mindset in order to be willing to put in that kind of effort. (10,000 hours is 4.8 years at 40 hours a week.)<br /><br />Reading these books in pair helped me to appreciate each of them more, I believe.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|trying to put my wish list books into shopping cart but was unable,what am i doing wrong?please advise by email
0316017930|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. This was the first book of Gladwell that I read, and I found his style very easy to read. The book is using lots of references to the results of sociological and psychological research and experiments, includes descriptions of the historical events, and I found this aspect of the book to be educational.<br /><br />As for the \\"story of success\\", the idea that Gladwell presents is something that I always thought of. When I read the success stories in the past, and it sounded that people would do it all by themselves, I always felt that there was more to the stories that was being told. I was always curious to find out more about background of that person - who were his or her parents, what environment the person comes from, what experiences he/she went through and what events affected his/her life. Gladwell shows us the side of a story that often remains in the shadows - extraordinary circumstances, lucky coincidences, etc.<br /><br />I am giving the book 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons: first, I think the book was at times repetitive, and second, I think some facts or stories might have been stretched or tweaked a little bit to make sure that they fit the mould. However, the book still contains great deal of information, and was a good food for thoughts to me.
B008JAFXOQ|4.0|I viewed this due to the content and the premise of the child struggling with truth.  Realizing this was the actress from the TV Series True Blood I thought i was going to be disappointed in her acting.  I am shocked to say she carried the role perfect. If she maintains her application of dialougue with the perfection she achieved in this movie she will be a star like George Clooney, Meryl Strep, or Al Pacino.  Oh Yeah I really enjoy this movie.
0307279189|5.0|BORN TO RUN is a funny, suspenseful, entertaining, and educational book. It's Christopher McDougall's quest to figure out why his feet hurt when he ran. His search led him from doctor to doctor and finally to the reclusive Tarahumara Indians living in the inaccessible Copper Canyons in Mexico.<br /><br />I'm not a runner but I stumbled upon this book while watching McDougall's interview on \\"The Daily Show\\" with Jon Stewart.<br /><br />The Tarahumara are a fascinating people. They wear sandals and run hundreds of miles just for fun in an inhospitable climate. They have no crime, no depression and none of the big killers that the `developed world' has -- cancer, heart disease, diabetes and such.<br /><br />McDougall also describes long distance racing. Not wimpy little 26-mile marathons, but footraces of 100 miles! I'd never heard of such a pastime. And the key seems to be to ditch your sneakers. All those high-priced running shoes do more harm than good. The theory is that all the stability and mechanics they build into the shoe means your body isn't required do what it's meant to do.<br /><br />He talks about research studies that show regardless of training surface, running speed, motivation, weekly mileage, body weight, or history of injuries, the common denominator in injuries was the cost of the running shoe worn. \\"Runners in shoes that cost more than $95 were more than twice as likely to get hurt as runners in shoes that cost less than $40.\\"<br /><br />The result of McDougall's quest is a highly entertaining history of the Tarahumara, of the shoe cartel, and of the science of running. You won't want to put it down till you know who wins the final race.
0345803493|2.0|Well where to begin with Fifty Shades Darker other than these books are so poorly written that I almost hate myself for reading them yet mysteriously I can't stop.  The author writes so atrociously and with such redundancy that you're left thinking \\"ANOTHER REPETITIVE SEX SCENE?!\\" Don't get me wrong some are better than others, but doesn't EL James know any adjectives and/or phrases other than:<br /><br />lip biting<br />Oh my<br />eyes narrowing<br />eyes widening<br />smirking<br />flushing<br />exploding<br />groaning<br />give it to me<br />oh baby<br />palms twitching<br />laters, baby<br />and my personal favorite:  clambering! If I have to hear about Ana clambering in and out of bed or out of the shower or into Christian's lap blah blah blah ONE MORE TIME...I'm really gonna lose it. Where was the editor to tell the author to come up with some new phrasing a thesaurus or something??<br /><br />I rolled my eyes so much during this book that I thought Christian was gonna slap me silly.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the plausibility of this book! I mean really?? It's suspension of disbelief here but even I can't believe that all this crap happens in a matter of what? SIX WEEKS?? Or something to that effect... There are so many sex scenes that it's really hard to believe that Ana isn't out of commission with a raging UTI from all the screwing.<br /><br />Christian and Ana really both get very annoying in this book. Not that they weren't somewhat annoying in Fifty Shades of Grey but they really bug in this book. Ana is so indecisive and all over the place and Christian is such a moody bastard.  They make the Twilight characters look good in comparison.<br /><br />When it boils down to it these books really are like reading someone's kinky diary. You know you shouldn't be doing it but you can't stop.
B008OJIBH8|1.0|This is a way overpriced piece of plastic. In 2002 I bought the E.T. DVD gift set. The list price was $49. Granted it was some years ago. But the point is, the nice gate fold box included: 3 DVDs (2 versions of the movie. The original and re release) and a bonus features disc. Each of the other DVDs also had special features as well. It also included a CD of the remastered complete score. A hardcover coffee table book on the making of E.T. with incredible images. A COA and a matted 35 mm frame of the move! NOW THAT IS WAS A COLLECTORS EDITION! Not this Toys-R-Us horse shit for $140 bucks! I'm definitely buying E.T. on Bluray but not this version. I know Walmart is doing a gift set that includes a cute plush E.T. with the Bluray / DVD / digital copy for only $19 bucks.
B003HARV4S|5.0|This movie is powerful and effective and carries the viewer along on a ride that offers fantasy mystery with adventure and romance thrown in as extras. The settings and ambience leave little to be desired and establish an aura of romantic intrigue that compliments the outstanding acting on the part of the entire cast. The background music and surround sound never overpower the dialogue and the overall balance produces a highly effective movie that leaves the viewer wanting more.<br /><br />The characters are masterfully portrayed by the cast and help carry the viewer along as they experience the situations generated by the fascinating story of an individual who rises to the top of his profession as an illusionist but is in love with that unobtainable women who is the object of all he desires.<br /><br />This one is a keeper and is worthy of repeated viewings. I recommend it highly.

B004LWZW88|4.0|Usually, when you get a 5th sequel to a movie, you know the Studio is just cashing in as quickly as possible. Yet, the Shrek series has continued to turn out strong, witty movies. Puss in Boots even succeeds in taking the franchise beyond Shrek and the Ogres, focusing on fan favorite Puss in Boots. As a film, Puss in Boots is distinct from the Shrek films, but keeps the same lovable wit and spoofs on classic fairy tales.<br /><br />The plot of Puss in Boots involves everybody's favorite cat joining Humpty Dumpty in a quest to steal magic beans from Jack and Jill. It works by and large. There are quite a few laugh out loud moments. Two things prevent me from giving it a fifth star. First, the scriptwriters opted to go for a \\"conspiracy  theory\\" ending. I won't say any more for fear of spoiling it, but it doesn't seem to follow from the rest of the movie. Second, I thought Puss' love interest was a bit too typical. She's a strong female cat who plays coy with Puss and seems like any number of female love interests from action movies nowadays..<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad to see the Shrek franchise alive and well. Puss in Boots is fun for both kids and adults.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really don't understand all the bad reviews. Sometimes you read a book just for the entertainment value, that is exactlty what this is, it is entertainment, not literature.  There is a difference.  I don't usually read this genre, but it was recomended to me by several people.  I enjoyed it, and couldn't wait to buy the second in the series.  I have read the entire series and unless you are a book snob, or you just CAN NOT overlook a few typos(and I mean a few, as this book is not overloaded with them) you will not be wasting your money. There was a lot of repetition of certain phrases, but that was easy for me to ignore.

B00005N7Z1|3.0|It is the unspecified near future.  The Setting is Old Detroit.  A multi-corporation has taken control of numerous aspects of the American industry, including the police department.  After a failed product demonstration with a proposed 'urban pacification' droid, a young executive for the company, OCP, takes hold of the situation.  They will create a cyborg from a slain officer, melding man with machine.<br />So begins Robocop, one of the 80s most action-packed and surprisingly intelligent sci-fi actioners ever.  Though the film has lost a lot of its punch since its initial release in 1987, it still remains to this day an action-packed thrill ride.  The action is literally non-stop; you rarely get a chance to catch your breath.  One thing I think people overlook or sometimes flat out omit in this movie is its intelligence.  It is much brainier than the standard action fare.  Here are some examples:<br />Corporate business practices: These were frequently discussed in the 80s.<br />Yuppies: Or young Urban Professionals are a target here as well.  They were snotty rich kids in the 80s that felt the world owed them for their mere existence, and they could just take all they darn well wanted.  Look at Bob Morton and Dick Jones and tell me they don't represent the Yuppies stereotypes of the day.<br />With those being said, the film is unabashedly a product of the mid 80s: a school is even called Lee Iacocca Elementary, named after the 1980s businessman who advocated foreign imports. The movie is such an extreme satire, it comes across like a dark comedy at times.  The film has an advertisement of the whimsical \\"NUKEM\\" board game (a family game. Ha-ha!), and the cynical media were all derivative of 80s culture.  Even the \\"Star Wars\\" Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) gets an honorable mention.<br />A common discussion about this movie is the violence.  It is indeed very violent, that being said, it will repel those who come into it not knowing what to expect. The generic-sounding title and innocuous cover reveals nothing: it just looks like another run-of-the-mill 80s action flick.  But as gory as it can get, I feel people have a tendency to exaggerate it a bit. The violence has been tamed by today's standards.  It's not that it wouldn't still be an 'R', but since its release, so many movies have adopted this type of violence, and even surpassed it. The most violent scenes for me are as follows: The ED-209 malfunction, Murphy's death, and the subsequent deaths of his murderers, particularly the now-infamous melting man sequence.  But the first and last I just mentioned are so overblown, they become comical. The ED-209 death is such overkill (no pun intended), it becomes humorous.  After getting torn to bits by bullets, one of the executives even quips: \\"Can we get a paramedic?\\" A Paramedic: You mean coroner, don't you? LOL!  However, Murphy's death to this day, is gruesome and sadistic, and it is meant to be. Verhoeven wanted the audience to be outraged, to feel for the character, since at this point we barely know him. But when he gets brought back, and liberates his death and his humanity (with OCP using his body against his will), what you receive in return is an amazingly gratifying experience.  With the exception of the squeamish, this is must-see 80s action.

B008B7OQHM|4.0|I am a chick & I have excellent taste in music I must say! I LOVE Slipknot & I do not care who they do or do not worship, I love Corey's voice, I love the instrumentals & sound effects & I love the lyrics, they speak to me. I like all their songs & albums (I wish they would release more copies of Mate Feed Kill Repeat) & I didn't see any disturbingly violent artwork in this at all, just some tools (without blood on them) & a dead bird. The red devil's head inside of the cover is clearly a styrofoam head, painted red with horns on it. Seeing images of the devil do not disturb me in the least & this was clearly done for shock value. My only complaint about this cd (hence the 4-stars instead of 5) is they could have included the non-live albulm version of Purity on the non-live disc. I cannot wait until Slipknot comes out with some new material, I like Stone Sour but I LOVE Slipknot & their creepy masks (Corey's Subliminal Verses Mask was my fave)! Sorry dude down below, but in my opinion, Slipknot puts GWAR to shame & I like GWAR! :-P<br /><br />*RIP Paul Gray, you will always be remembered!*
B003V4AK8E|3.0|This is a perfectly usable controller for most games. It's large, heavy, solid and well-textured. If, like me, the Dual Shock 3 gets lost in your large manly hands, this is a good choice.<br /><br />But it isn't perfect.<br /><br /> - There's definitely a large dead zone there, so I wouldn't suggest it for hardcore FPS titles like the Modern Warfare titles. Fortunately for me, I play all my shooters on the PC.<br /><br /> - I'm not sure whether it's just Uncharted 3 (I doubt it), but my left analog stick seems to have a faulty NNW zone. I can never make Drake take off at full speed if I press towards the NNW from a standstill. But if he's already running, pointing in that direction works. Haven't been able to test it on any other game yet. Strange, and a little disappointing.<br /><br /> - The face buttons need to be pressed really hard. This was almost a dealbreaker for me during my first few days of use. Over time, I've either gotten used to it, or they've softened up a bit, so it isn't an issue any longer.<br /><br />Overall, I don't regret buying this, and I'm really glad it exists, but I'm not sure I'd buy another one. Hope a revised version is released eventually.

B007X4ECLY|2.0|This is one of those movies that you pretty much know what to expect and that's pretty much what you get.  A bulked up Guy Pearce takes the lead as Snow, a former government agent who has been accused of espionage and murder.  I didn't know CIA/Secret Service agent were so funny but the film's writers give Snow plenty of one-liners which does have its charm.  Maggie Grace is the babe in jeopardy.  Emilie is also the do-gooder daughter of the U. S. President and is in space on the world's largest and only orbiting penal colony.<br /><br />It has been very successful because all the prisoners are put in a state of suspended animation known as stasis.  In 2089, this appears to be a pretty effective way of dealing with bad guys.  While interviewing one of the most vile and ugliest criminals in the prison, Hydell (Joseph Gilgun) manages to grab a gun from one of Emilie's bodyguards.  All of the prisoners are then uncaged and the predictable fun begins.  One of the first things that all of these just freed convicts does is get into fights with each other.  Ridiculous.<br /><br />Back at Secret Service headquarters, Snow has been chosen to infiltrate the prison and get Emilie out.  He agrees because he needs to find the location of a mysterious briefcase that was given to an accomplice.  That accomplice is also in the prison.  Now if I'm the prez and I have all these Navy Seal types at my disposal, is my first choice a suspected spy and murderer?  I don't think so, but off he goes.  Like numerous other films (think \\"Die Hard\\"), Snow must navigate the inner passages of the prison aided by some scientific mapsters on the base station.<br /><br />The film looks good most of the time but there are clearly evident overuses of green/blue screen trickery on some of the interior shots.  This was an unrated version but I'm not sure what was added or deleted.  While there are plenty of sexual references there is no sex or nudity.  I suspect a few more deaths are depicted although none are overly graphic.  While the film follows the playbook of a \\"B\\" movie, it's not horrible.  That's not saying much, is it?<br /><br />If you're on the fence as to whether to watch this movie, the way you watch it might make a difference.  This Sony Blu ray transfer is in  a word, spectacular in every respect.  The 1080p transfer has a 2.39:1 aspect ratio and is of demo quality.  Everything looks great.  Black space against an orbiting prison is perfect.  Close ups look good as well.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  Likewise it's superb.  You will have perfectly centered dialog and the film's actions sequences, including some space fighter jets, will keep all your speakers jumping including the LFE channel.ne are overly graphic.

You will have perfectly centered dialog and the film's actions sequences, including some space fighter jets, will keep all your speakers jumping including the LFE channel.
0670023329|5.0|Shin Dong-hyuk is the only person known to escape from a political prison camp in North Korea after having been born and raised there. His story as told by Blaine Harden in Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West is extraordinary not only for the picture it paints of life inside the camp, but for the unlikely way Shin escaped and found his way to China, South Korea, and the U.S.<br /><br />Indeed some of his stories of life inside the camp are so extreme that it's hard to believe any human could endure life there for long periods of time, much less survive from infancy to adulthood. Shin was rewarded for snitching, his mother meant nothing to him except as a competitor for food, prisoners were killed for small infractions, and children were sometimes beaten to death. Recognizing that readers may be incredulous, Harden cites similar stories told by other prisoners who have escaped other camps over the years. He also details the ways he has endeavored to verify Shin's story and ways he cannot.<br /><br />As much as the story is Shin's, it is also about North Korea and how its isolation from the world community has affected the people who live there. Escape from Camp 14 is not an easy book to read. It is shocking and at times gut wrenching to learn about why people are put in political camps and the conditions they endure there. And you can't help but imagine the day-to-day struggle Shin faces in a world alien to the one he was raised in. But it's an important book that will give you faith in the human spirit as well as a new perspective on North Korea every time it pops up in the news. I recommend it for ages 16 and up.<br /><br />The publisher provided me with a copy of this book to review.
B002NXSRVG|3.0|It's was a action thriller of sci-fi and live and action with amination to fill in what they coudn't do in real life.
0345803493|2.0|Thankfully the second book had a bit of a plot. The sex scenes were quite dull and repetitive, however. The writing is marginally better--but that's one grade above drivel so take it as you must. I'm still uncertain why it captured the time of millions of readers but at least it's a fast read (while stuck in a airport, on a rainy day, sick in bed.... you know when you could do without your brain for a few hours)
B005LAIH4A|1.0|A few people pointed out my error on the running time - some politely, some not so much. I especially liked the guy who called me a hater then suggested I move to China (does that qualify for irony?).  Other than my mistake on the run time, I stand by my review. It is my opinion of a movie based on one of my favorite childhood books. I appreciate all the comments, and I've given each one the consideration it deserves.<br /><br />Read your kids the book instead.<br /><br />Other than the Lorax and the Once-ler appearing in both, there isn't much the movie has in common with the book. If you're looking for another movie that demonizes business and makes business owners out to be liars and only out to make a buck, this movie is for you. If you were expecting a wonderful tale based on Dr. Suess' book, you may want to wait for the remake (I'm sure there will be one in the next two years).<br /><br />While the animation does a good job of presenting the story, it misses out on all the wonderful little details that a Dr. Suess book is known for. (The movie \\"Horton Hears a Who\\" does a pretty good job.) This movie is over ninety minutes long, but despite that the characters never get a chance to develop. Other than comic relief or the obligatory love theme, most characters are there to push the anti-business agenda that runs throughout the entire movie. Everything is superficial, and the movie tries too hard to push that anti-business agenda instead of telling a wonderful story of the consequences of not taking care of the planet. A total miss. Don't waste your money.
B002PNHX3C|5.0|I love this movie. It never ceases to amuse me when I watch these four icons as young men barely, into their 20's. John, Paul, George and Ringo all do a fantastic job being themselves (basically). Lot's of teenage hysteria and Paul's eccentric grand dad to deal with to boot. A wonderful capturing of what Beatlemania was like all those years ago. The quality of the Blu-Ray picture is impeccable. Wonderful detailed transfer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really loved the entire series!  Yes the writing was somewhat repetative, but if you are able to see the real story, it's awesome!
B006LSZECO|4.0|There had to have been a fierce bidding war to secure the rights for the film adaption of this because it has all the makings of a deliciously wicked thriller. The seemingly perfect couple, their fifth wedding anniversary, and she disappears without a trace. Told through alternating chapters narrated by him on the day of the disappearance, and her diary entries beginning years before, Flynn creates a portrait of a marriage that  is laser sharp in it's precision, which means uncomfortably honest enough you find yourself cringing and giggling at the same time. The first half of the book moves at a measured pace with a slow roll out, but without giving anything away, she suddenly ratchets up the stakes, and straps you in for a wild ride, that I found myself hard pressed to get off of until it all played out.
B005USZYDU|2.0|???????<br />Guess In do not know how to use my kindle yet.  I had thought it said this was a free kindle book in the free section, so I ordered it.  Much to my surprise I was billed.  Will not be buying books again.  Haven't read it yet, am up to the 8th chapter, so far enjoying the book, but am sure TICKED.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|With Evermore I am easily able to access notes and articles across all my digital devices - iPhone, Kindle Fire,  PCs. I just love the ease of access to my information!
1466401885|5.0|I devoured this book in one day. The plot of the story was fast paced and had me wanting more. The chemisty between Abby and Travis was at the forefront of the storyline from the very beginning. I really liked Shepley and America. They weren't annoying characters, they were the right amount of friend/conciousness for their best friends. I also love Finch, he's a sweetie and I found him comical. I loved the portrayal of Travis's family. Though Abby may have fallen in with the crazy Maddox boys too easily, it worked.<br /><br />One of the negatives of this book had to be the grammatical errors. I know this happens with self-published titles; I guess it's just a pet peeve of mine. I read books to get lost in another world, and that is hard to do when the writing pulls me back out. There weren't a ton of mistakes (most towards the end of the book), but it was enough for me to notice.<br /><br />Overall, the book is totally worth the read. I loved the plot and the characters. If you can get past the grammatics (mistakes do happen!), then I think you will enjoy this book too!
0060555661|5.0|Very informative book.  Have only read about half way so far, but this book I will read, re-read, and use as a reference for along time.  The format is somewhat confusing, but there is not a better way to update a very valuable but old book.
B003OFVIXG|5.0|There is something of the great Edith Piaf in Zaz - a first rate singer, and a wonderful performer (check out her concert videos on YouTube).  She has so much talent, so much energy that she leaves you gasping for breath!  Like Adele, like Nora Jones, like Nolween Leroy and Lara Fabian, Zaz is a breath of fresh air, and stands apart and above the generic horde of mainstream female jazz/pop singers of the past decade.  I am now very much looking forward to her next studio album!
0307279189|5.0|This book is incredible, I'd recommend this book for anyone who wants to know more about the history of running. It's a great tale that alternates between historical facts of how we became the runners we are today, how many ultraraces started, and why we were born to run. It answers a lot of questions with out being in your face about it. He does a good job about keeping his story separate from the facts.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Simply the best retro RPG out there for Android. If someone knows one better, let me know IMMEDIATELY.<br /><br />I just finished beating this with 15 hours, and I'm thinking about playing it again and getting 100% complete on it.
0470570954|5.0|I got a good book for a very low price. new books were about 100-200 bucks and I got a used for 40.<br />Although it was used, it seems like its barely used. Maybe someone carried it around and scratched the sides but the inside text and everything else seems great.
B0086700CM|3.0|This game was fun at first but as u play it, it gets boring?!! I would totally recommend it but it will get boring.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is simple yet addicting. its easy at first but does get a little more challenging. its fun to play and hard to put down.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game. Its the best so far! If u r a great illustrator I would recommend getting this game because there r some really hard words to draw! Pleassee get it!!
B004AFFZNI|5.0|when you buy a GoPro you should have the option of a skeleton case or the waterproof case. Having said that I would have bought both anyway.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry birds is a great app and is very fun. You will love it and I would  totally recommend this game. Please get this game!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it! Especially how it keeps everything in memory. I love the design and the size of the calculator.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is a great twist on Mario. Its almost better! I would totally recommend this game! If you love Mario you will love Lep!
0345803485|5.0|Very enjoyable read!!  I couldn't put the book down. I loved the characters and story.  I read the entire series in 4 days because I couldn't wait to find out how Ana and Christian would end up.  E L James does not disappoint!!<br />It would be awesome if James wrote future stories about Kate and Elliot's relationship and Mia and Ethan's relationship!!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is really fun just like the other TeamLava games! You get to own your own restaurant and buy items like tables and chairs to decorate your place. P.s. if they ask you to buy gems just know that they cost a lot of money. Thanks for reading!!
0425263908|5.0|I thought this book was entertaining and I can't wait to read the next book in the Crossfire series.  The characters are all so flawed and intriguing.  I don't know what I am more excited for...to find out more about Gideon's and the other characters's pasts or to find out how their futures are going to end up.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much because its fun I have a lot of apps and this is the one I mostly play.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|this app is very nice, using with DROID 3.  only drawback I've seen is if I accidentally mark something paid, I can't undo it.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Don't even hesitate to press the 1-click order button. These are seriously great headphones. Yes, the high-end is a little bright, but for the money, THESE CANNOT BE BEATEN. Very comfortable, circumaural. THESE HAVE BIG CUPS AND BIG DRIVERS! 50mm drivers make for big cups, much bigger than you imagine from the picture.<br /><br />The sound clarity is unparalleled. You can hear all of the bass, but it's not overpowering (I'm looking at you, Beats by Dr. Dre...) $33 is a steal for a wonderful pair of headphones. Includes a screw-on 1/4in adapter AND a carrying bag, which is awesome!<br /><br />They ARE ALL-DAY COMFORTABLE. They are pressure-free. I wore them for 10 hours straight gaming and could easily go another 10 hours. They don't really make you sweat either.<br /><br />These are NOT even remotely noise isolating. BUT they still sound incredible.<br /><br />Don't even hesitate to press the 1-click order button!
B0086700CM|4.0|Good game with decent graphics. Fair range of achievements to shoot for and interesting enough to come back to play.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|I was sad over Andy's death but vengeance is still very good. I didn't think it was as good as blood and sand or gods of the arena but still good. The new Spartacus played the part well, I did not like the new Naevia but to be fair the original actress wasn't great either. If I had to rate the seasons this would be third place but John Hannah was simply amazing in the other seasons and nobody really stepped up to replace his good acting. I can't wait until the final season though.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|The whole book reads like movie script -  I just got through 25% of it, trying to understand what is the hype. The chapters are broken up like they are made for a movie, go here do that, say that, then go there. There is no flow and there is no emtional flow . It is mostly just the plot. So to speak the book is all  bones, without the flesh.<br />And I am not liking all the violence too. Isn't fantasy supposed to be about good vs. evil . Well, in this book where is the good? The good gets you killed. If I wanted the  real ugly life story I could just turn on CNN.<br />To even compare it to the \\" Lord of the Rings\\" is a travesty. I should get a refund.
B002ZG9788|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, but I did not watch the original nor do I care. When I go watch a movie I don't care if it doesn't follow mythology or even the remake because I just want to watch a good movie, and clash of the titans was a good movie. The acting was good, the script was good, and the special effects were good. I don't understand why so many people hate on the film because it doesn't follow greek mythology, its still fiction either way. I would understand if it was history but it isn't.
1416550550|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It is beautifully written and the story is so mysterious and suspenseful.  I love how the author weaves three stories back and forth between the years.  It is the best book I have read in a long time....I actually got goosebumps when I read the ending.  That never happens!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I did not want to put the down. Although not totally believable, but was still a good book to read.
0743496736|4.0|The Columbine-like high school massacre which serves as the backdrop for \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" is haunting, particulary since I was halfway into this novel the weekend of the tragic movie theater murders in Aurora, Colorado.  Jodi Picoult's writing always grips me, but never as quickly as it does in the first paragraph of this mesmerizing novel.  She brilliantly captures Peter's angst at being a scorned outsider tortured by cliques of cruel high school classmates.  A very readable, but sobering, page-turner from Jodi Picoult that was hard to put down.
B000QCSA54|4.0|I thought this book had a great way of looking at business.  Quitting may go against your own values but this book shows you how sometimes the only way you can get ahead is by quitting if what you're doing isn't working for you.  I read this book as part of a Leadership Book Club for my work and I'm so glad I did.  Although this book is mostly reflected upon the business world I can definitely see some real life applications.<br /><br />Quitting doesn't mean you're weak, it means you're smart enough to know when the road you're on is going to lead to nothing but failure.  Retreat, regroup, then try a different avenue.  That's the overall gist of this book but it goes into so much more detail.<br /><br />Great book to suggest to co-workers and managers alike and great for those looking into becoming an entrepreneur of some kind.
B006J420UE|5.0|This quad-core 3.0GHz unlocked processor from AMD is all about excellent value, great everyday performance, and good gaming capabilities. So with that in mind, the A8-3870k is an all-around solid performer. The price of a system built around an AMD APU is going to be attractive to budget builders out there. The fact that I can play most games on moderate to high settings using the onboard Radeon HD6550d is amazing. The WEI scores for the CPU and GPU are 7.4 (processor) 6.7 (desktop) and 6.7 (gaming). That means that this APU can make Windows happy, your media will play fast, and you can do some gaming. Four cores means browsing the net, running a virus scan, editing video, and any other apps you use while switching back and forth at the same time will STILL be responsive.<br /><br />Most will buy this APU with SFF/micro atx in mind, so it's definitely going to show up in LAN fests LOL. But if you wanna push this APU a little (given the right board, case, and cooling solution) it can go higher thanks to an unlocked multiplier. I have it installed in an ASUS F1A75V-Pro (full ATX sized) motherboard and just using ASUS AI Suite it is OCd to 3.4 GHz, with the APU set to Turbo which boosts it from 600MHz to 800MHz.<br /><br />I have 8GB (2x4GB) of Kingston HyperX T1 DDR3 XMP 1600. I also purchased a Sapphire Radeon 6670 1GB DDR3 graphics card to test out in conjunction with the 6550D (AMD's Dual Graphics tech). Everything works great!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is in my list of favorites!  As soon as I was done reading it, I immediately started rereading it.  I love the characters, as flawed as they may be, but who isn't?  Yes there were some typos but they don't take away from the story and now that a publisher has picked up this book they will be fixed in the next edition.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this calculator, its very simple and easy to use.  I take my Kindle everywhere so its always there when I need it.  Just what I wanted, and its free! Cant beat the price!
B0086213XW|2.0|Enter Margot (Michelle Williams); saying Margot has a lot of quirks is an understatement. Margot is downright flawed. She's very peculiar with not only the things she likes, but in everything she does. She's afraid of the thought of being afraid; those in-between moments in life. The events that kick off those moments and their conclusions don't phase her one way or the other, but what bridges together those moments is the most terrifying thing in the world to Margot. While traveling, Margot meets Daniel (Luke Kirby); a private painter who makes his living pulling a rickshaw around town. There's chemistry between Margot and Daniel right from the start, but Margot is married to a chef named Lou (Seth Rogen) so things are obviously a little complicated. There's this simultaneous unstoppable chain of events that transpires as Margot gets closer and closer to Daniel, but she feels her marriage to Lou crumbling in the process. It's an in-between moment that Margot has lost all control over.<br /><br />This is the most frustrating movie of the year; hands down. It's nearly two hours of characters being pulled in directions they don't want to go and playing tug of war with their emotions when things could easily be resolved with a few simple actions. For a movie whose screenplay was included in The Black List a few years ago, the final result is a huge letdown. The dialogue is downright atrocious at times. Margot's little \\"gaylord\\" speech to Daniel being the prime example, but their exchange on the airplane leaves you with a furrow in your brow. Margot says something along the lines of, \\"I'm afraid of being afraid,\\" after confessing her fears to Daniel to which Daniel replies, \\"That sounds like the most dangerous thing in the world.\\" Really? Because like seven hundred other things come to mind that are way more dangerous.<br /><br />The three main characters leave you with the urge to lobotomize yourself. Margot can't make a decision to save her life and when she finally does she regrets not staying on the path she was already on. Lou is seriously a contender of the most childish excuse of an adult to grace the silver screen. The immature jokes between him and Margot make you want to projectile vomit on newborn puppies and the two of them have the worst pillow talk you could possibly imagine. Daniel is the most interesting of the three, but only because he acts so cryptic and tries so hard to be this enigma. You remember that scene in \\"Family Guy\\" where Stewie mocks people who think they're photography majors because they took a black and white picture of a lawn chair? That's kind of the way Daniel is with painting.<br /><br />The entire movie can be summed up in four actions; cooking, sleeping, being immature, and cheating on your husband. The end. Cue \\"Video Killed the Radio Star.\\" Thirty minutes in and you're ready for every character to s**t or get off the pot. \\"Take This Waltz\\" also includes a shower scene with about a dozen women you wish you never saw naked. After seeing it, you'll be convinced that the only reason Sarah Silverman joined the cast was to get naked on screen and brag about how hot she looks.<br /><br />\\"Take This Waltz\\" tries to take advantage of this preconceived notion that you already love this movie even though you haven't seen it yet. It tries so hard to be cute and cuddly and emotional and it winds up being massively annoying in the process. \\"Here's some actors you may have enjoyed in other things along with some humor you won't find funny and a horrid screenplay that we insist on cramming down your throat. Oh and people cry a lot, so you better do that too.\\"<br /><br />It will be a damn miracle if you can finish \\"Take This Waltz,\\" but if you do you'll have to fight every urge to run off into the night, scream at the top of your lungs, and tell every couple within a six block radius to just end it now and screw the first person they come into contact with because that'll be quicker and easier than pretending to love each other and wasting everyone's time for an undetermined amount of years. Just save yourself the trouble and punch a brick wall; it'll have a better outcome.ng to love each other and wasting everyone's time for an undetermined amount of years. Just save yourself the trouble and punch a brick wall; it'll have a better outcome.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great app for a challenge! A fun way to waste some time. The young kids like it also.
B0086700CM|3.0|does not download well for android. my dad has a galaxy and it has trouble running as well not just on kindle fire. it works but the glitches cause you to mess up and die.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is awesome. every game gives you a new challenge. it makes you think about what your doing. I love this game.
B008KW43TE|5.0|What a surprise!!! My first exposure to Frank Ocean was \\"bad religion\\", which I thought was fine, but not really something I would buy. Once I stated listening to the other songs on the album, I was blown away. There are so many good songs, and the album as a whole is a great listen. Pyramids, Pink Matter, Thinkin Bout You, and Forest Gump are just a few of my favorites. The music is really good, and SO is the writing. This album is miles ahead of everything else in RnB right now, and I would expand that to hip-hop and pop aswell.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|this is the bestgame ever you can do all this stuff metal sonic can also turn super shadow and silver are in this game
B00127RAJY|4.0|I waited a little bit before writing a review.  I have done this DVD for 16 days (not all in a row).  I'm on Level 2 right now.<br /><br />I think Jillian is a really great trainer, and I like the \\"girls\\" too.  Anita is another one of my non-Jillian workout DVDs so I was happy to see her.<br /><br />Prior to starting this DVD I would exercise regularly, doing an easy workout DVD followed by a more challenging DVD, then I would do about an hour on the treadmill, walking at a fast pace, but not running.  I was working our for close to 2 hours a day, but still feeling like my workout wasn't challenging enough.<br /><br />I was actually looking into Zumba videos, but they were very expensive, but I saw 30 Day Shred in my recommendations (thank you Amazon!).  I saw that this DVD got really good reviews and its very reasonably priced.  Not to mention it was in the top 10 in Movies and TV (that's right not just Top 10 in Exercise & Fitness).  I ended up purchasing this DVD and a few other Jillian DVDs (which I haven't tried yet).<br /><br />I wanted a DVD that really kicked my butt, and this sure did!  The first day I did Level 1 I was only a few minutes in and I thought i was going to barf because the work out was so intense.  Now on level two...people say its a love hate relationship with Jillian and it truly is.  She pushes me to push myself, and I do, but I'm still calling her a crazy bitch when I try to catch my breath.<br /><br />I think I've only lost a few lbs. but I do notice that my body has changed.  I'm more tone now (especially in my middle area).  My jeans are baggy on me now.<br /><br />Summary:  Don't be discouraged if Level 1 is too difficult, keep at it and you'll be able to do it.  Only down side is that this workout is really hard on my knees, even when I do the easy versions of the exercises.  My knees aren't so good, but for normal people with ok knees this workout should be no problem.  This warning is just for people like me with knee and/or joint sensitivity.  If I take a break for a few days my knees are ok.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|really cool. I could not use several games in my tiny leaving room and this piece simply solve it like magic. Extremely simple to install (5 secounds...). Recomend to any one that hve a kinect in small space.
