B00HHNGWAA|5|Exactly as ordered. Worked well.
B001JL42L2|4|Very sturdy hooks. A must for pickup beds.
B00062ZLW4|5|I noticed an improvement. For the price it's actually cheaper in the long run, and I don't have to think about for 50,000 miles (Give or Take). Then buy the cleaning kit, and that will probably be good for 2 or 3 cleanings, so I'm looking at 150 to 200 thousand miles. That would be about the same as OEM's over time.
B00NIX3N5A|5|Strong and substantial quality.  Note:  These do not work on Colorados with the factory wheel flares.  Be warned!
B004WMB830|4|I've had these in operation on my 01 GL1800 since Feb 2014.  I ruined another rear tire and ordered new front and back Stones so I decided to go ahead and replace these sensors as well.  These work great.  I adjusted the alarm limits to very high/very low so I would likely never get the annoying flashing red numbers.  Once you get the red, it won't show you anything else.  My display is right in front of my face (on the left front speaker grill) so I don't need no stinking flashing red - I'm always checking it.  This thing works great - it's how I knew I had picked up another screw in my $180 tire *^$^%#@&&(*.  The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is the difficulty ordering/acquiring this stuff.  I had to order my new sensors from Taiwan (athena.chen@orange-electronic.com, this is their website also) - $27 each plus 30 for shipping.  There is a new model out now, the M203 which shows battery also.  If you buy an older unit, make sure it's the model that goes up to 74psi since a Goldwing (and probably many others) will easily surpass 50 psi tire pressure.
B00N48BLO4|5|Prompt shipping. Everything fits and works great. Evergreen Parts sells good stuff.
B00ARURMEK|5|Pretty much a perfect replacement for 2004 Focus side mirror that had chipped housing.  I say &#34;pretty much&#34; because the top corner does stick out a tad more than the original, but hardly noticeable (talking a few mm's).  I could tack it down with some type of glue I suppose.
B004LEYJO4|5|Soft peddle? Try Motul. Good stuff I've used for many years in cars I take to track events, HPDE, etc.  Change more often than regular brake fluid, as I've been told the higher temperature stuff attracts water more readily than the regular stuff. Overkill for the street.  If you still need more headroom, next step is the Castrol SRF Full Synthetic fluid, but it's more $$.
B00DSR48NC|4|They came quickly.  They are not as thick and plush as I was expecting, but they are beautiful.
B0049TTR6G|5|Worked great and arrived when promised.  Great experience and looking forward to many more.
B0006H8BDU|5|Worked very well great price and better than the Original equipment would highly recommended !
B003VCD7UE|2|I am not entirely convinced by these things. I bought one for each of our cars. It can take a few minutes of fiddling under the car to get the draincock to turn, especially after awhile. I've had them on for about 7 months and have only used them twice, and they are getting harder, not easier, to turn. This concerns me about the long term reliability. It'd be faster to just unscrew a bolt and replace the crush washer, and way cheaper. I'd have to buy about 40 brass washers (they're 79 cents) to break even with this thing and I don't think I'll ever change the oil 40 times over the life of my car.<br /><br />It's over-priced and generally a finicky design. It seems save, but realistically I should have just spent the money on a oil pump to do an under-the-hood oil change (you never have to pull the plug out of the pan)
B001DRHMRI|5|It works.
B00880C5O8|5|A++++++
B00JI8Q5M2|5|Perfect fit look just like the oem
B00IAHIAYS|1|No strainer, no o-ring, no nut it wasn't even threaded.
B000C492SU|1|it´s dosn´t work
B00DI4TA2Y|4|For the price, you cant beat it, its a rock solid DOT approved helm and it looks great.
B000CR1RVW|1|Bought two of these for my motorhome, first trip after putting them in, one was dead....  I may rethink LED's now.
B0098VIVJY|5|So far these towels work great for windows haven't had any disappointment yet.
B001C20T9C|4|Worked Fine
B00GI822C2|4|Really nice, it Fit perfect in my vw beetle:)
B004N63S9W|5|We own very nice cars and this product does a great job.  It cleans the leather and the plastic in our cars.  No more double bottles!  Saves space and time and Mother's products are always on point and worth the money.  If you value your cars-you need to take care of them.
B0009YDQEE|5|Excellent product
B000BQWLE6|5|Perfect for the RV bathroom.  Small and compact.  Folds easy and can attached and detach on the floor with Velcro.
B00KXKW6WC|5|Bought for my winch.  Good quality.  Works great!
B001RUH8ES|5|Worked great on beige microfiber sofas. removed every stain.
B00E5Y6DSA|5|Looks great unlike the cheap emblems that look like tin foil wrap.
B00EA2VQ66|5|Love them
B00KTHXJHK|5|Had Cut and programmed.. no issues. works great. So far had key for two months as of aug 15.
B000BUOSGG|3|Bit smaller than I wanted.
B000ARPVUC|5|I know Fram has a bad rep with some people, but I've never had a problem. I love the grip on these, it makes it easy to change without a filter wrench.
B002P8WU80|5|A bit tricky to cut out but as long as your patient and good with scissors it's a piece of cake. Great product.
B007GCDZ7A|5|Batteries worked great. Packaged well for shipping and arrived as promised.
B00GTVPXNS|5|good product
B005N6XCBA|2|Sleeves are VERY form fitting and don't stretch well. I am a size small and could barely squeeze my arms into it. I also returned the shirt but they only refunded the amount that was charged to my credit card and never refunded the remaining balance that was used off of my gift card... tried contacting them but cannot find the contact info...
B002QH206W|5|This met or exceeded the factory filter. Plus saved at least $50 on dealer cost for item and installation cost
B00873J0YY|5|Excellent product!  My only complaint is that I wish the instructions had been clearer regarding sinking the bolts to lock them in place.  Took forever to get them tight.  Other than that, they are sturdy, secure, and work just as desired.  Thank you!
B0067UKLH4|5|Very please works perfect lot cheaper than auto part store
B007XE8C74|5|Amazing device. Reports every parameter of engine operation on our 2013 Toyota Highlander. Everyone should own one, if you're into fixing your own car.
B000E4LWDG|2|Vibration was annoying,,,Despite being sold as new... Had bug splatter on it.
B0039069KI|1|Didn't fix the problem. Still leaking
B00803BCUG|5|They fit my Lancer and stayed on for an 8 hour drive right after installing them. Good looking for the dollar. They won't take a curb impact so give yourself some space when parking.
B0041CDPQO|5|Works great!
B002M4GF10|5|Great fit very impressed!
B000CE9OY2|5|Works amazing
B006FOEDO4|5|Excellent quality. This is my second Mag-Hytec product. Going to get the transmission pan next.
B001DRP9G4|5|It works.
B001N0IROM|5|OEM hubcap. Good price, shipped fast.
B000CPI6S6|1|Ordered Reese brand and was shipped Chinese knockoff with lugs that were slightly too large for my trailer connectors<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Reese-Towpower-74184-Plastic-Vehicle/dp/B000CPI6S6/ref=sr_1_11?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1439909897&sr=1-11&keywords=reese+7+way
B00KY5HB9O|5|Arrived as expected and sound great
B00FLXF34Y|5|Excellent deal for product provided.  Great heavy duty hitch.
B00VEAST9Y|5|Its a fun sticker and better drive the speed limit
B00R3O0Y0M|4|This is a quick review.  I would have given 5 stars if the horns came with connection piece to link the two horns together and back to the OEM female connector for the stock horn. But once I made my own everything was a true plug and play. The sound is crisp, but not too over powering. Well made product and I would tell people to buy this if they were looking for a clean horn upgrade.
B003XJG4FK|5|not much to say it looks good
B000OZS9Y0|5|These things are awesome for the money. High quality and extremely strong. Cannot beat the price.
B00DRBI04M|5|easy install,sounds great....
B00RRM694U|5|I am in love with this item!!! My phone was always going dead on longer motorcycle rides (music, maps, taking pictures, etc.) but with this battery tender USB adapter I can easily keep my phone charged! I would definitely recommend this product!
B00PE534UY|2|Decent plate holder,looks good but letters are just vinyl stickers... spend the extra money for better quality. Oh and be prepared to pay return shipping if you dont like it.
B001AY2WLU|1|cheap product fell apart the first day. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B0002M711C|5|does what it is expected to do,would buy again.gauges installed in dirt sprint car.
B00ALH4BW0|1|The one I received was not like the OEM on the car or the picture shown.  It did not have the two pins on back. The word &#34;MINI&#34; was a beige color not chrome like shown. The all black background did not have the chrome circle outline around the word MINI.  Don't waste your money if your expecting something close to the OEM badge. update:12/16/15 I recieved no responses from seller after returning item.  So to sum things up,  I shipped back the item and recieved NO refund. So I lost my money and dont even have anything to show for it.  All together what a HORRIBLE purchasing experience this was.
B002E2X1KI|5|Perfect fit, abs light went out.
B011VSMZDE|2|I gave it 2 stars because it appears to be made out of quality material.  However the image itself was pretty blurry.  Unfortunately this was not an isolated problem to just me.  That is just the way they are.  Luckily my in laws are not picky and said they would work for them so I didn't return them.  If you are looking something clear then don't order these.
B00EM8944O|4|I had a pretty good, deep scratch about 3 feet long and it knocked it down by about 90%. Overall, I'm happy with the product. Easy to use and sound results. If I could rate it a 4.5 stars, I would've done that.
B000WJA5ZY|5|All my RAM mount products work exactly as they should, and never leave me wondering. Mount, tighten down, and forget them.
B00IRD1O7A|5|Very nice easy to use hitch.
B00VZ547WG|1|This RV air conditioner was a great disappoinment.  It does not cool more efficiently than the older version of this model.  It's boast of &#34;lighter&#34; weight is &#34;advertising speak&#34; for &#34;made of cheap plastic parts and controls&#34;.  Overall, it is LOUDER, not quieter, although you now cannot tell the difference between when the compressor clicks on or off.  Crappy product.
B004HE56CW|5|Happy
B0006MRS0C|5|Aaa
B00Y5FFM8G|1|Who in the hell would buy these?
B001KRA28M|5|Worked as expected
B00UW2LLYU|1|Does not screw on has to be glued my mechanic will not install it
B00VFEI1NI|5|easy to use, excellent quality, the black color ring is real leather and so will last longer
B00HE68CD0|5|It worked well.
B00PNUIKDG|5|Exactly what we needed.  Good price.  Youtube video helped to install it.<br /><br />Thanks!
B00GDM87U4|5|Receive the part it was the right one and worked great.
B004JBI6C0|5|Bought this one as a backup, the first one fit perfect and took the mildew smell out of the truck...
B00FRHOLK6|1|This wiper blade did not fit my car either another piece of crap
B0052SF0LO|4|Unit works great! Not as bright as I thought it would be, but still illuminates a decent sized area. The motion and lux sensor takes a bit of tweaking. But when you get it right it works great. The solar panel has been through many a downpour and still keeps the battery charged. Didn't look water tight, but I guess it is. Good unit for the price.
B0011DS9TE|5|great product, delivered in record time.
B0069ARUKI|5|Packaging was good, item arrived without defect. Adjusted easily to fit the bed and is secure enough to hold the groceries in place.
B003VGHB9I|5|fit exactly as it should.  much better than paying full price for oem
B0035J83BG|5|Now my 2013 Challenger RT muscle car sounds like a muscle car. Don't know about more power or better gas mileage but who cares.....just hearing that roar is satisfaction enough.
B000V9POYW|5|perfect for keeping top new
B003G0U56A|5|Great for keeping your car clean.
B007LIBU8U|5|great just what looking for
B009RC2HVC|5|Great service, excellent product.
B00OFBMKR6|5|The jacket is exactly what I expected. The mesh design allows enough ventilation to be comfortable at temperatures around 80 degrees. I am 6&#34;0' tall and weight 170 lbs. I ordered a large and the fit was perfect. The vendor, Leatherup.com, is another story. The jacket was supposed to include a zip-out liner and zip-out polyester vest. It arrived without the vest. Over the past two weeks I have received two phone calls and several e-mails telling me why the vest cannot be provided. I will not purchase from them again and advise others to do the same.
B00B5ZY07I|1|Easily came apart and broken
B0015PTTTW|4|Look great and easy to install...no issues as of yet
B00WRGC1BG|3|Great size an looks wonderful.  However I was under the understanding this was black in the middle and it was not it was burgundy.  :(
B00DR4C3VU|5|works like a charm
B000Z0HVHA|5|Received and tested yesterday. Looks to be fairly well made and it worked just like it was supposed to.<br />Update:  we've been using this steadily on our trip to power the Garmin Zumo in the Grand Cherokee from the rear outlet and it is working fine.<br />10/7/2015:  We just used this extensively, almost daily, during a 30-day, 6,000+ mile RV trip out West to power our Garmin Zumo from the rear outlet in the Grand Cherokee (we were using the front one to charge our phones, etc.) and it worked perfectly.  I recommend it.
B00PV6U31Y|1|didnt work properly
B0052LJ2VU|4|Fits nicely and helps with comfort during longer rides
B00F4OA534|5|Great tool for recharging auto a/c's
B00DGGHR3S|5|Perfect size but the pegs in the back were in different spots from the original.
B000RFUF12|5|Perfect for golf cart batteries!
B0006SU3QW|5|perfect & great price
B007FFNT6U|5|Got this for my new car because of my german shepherd. They are perfect for the price. They pill a little but Im willing to live with that
B00KTIZ0T4|5|Easy to program if you follow directions and I love the different color =) Easy to find my keys!
B00EI6CKVE|5|Who wouldnt love this on their car?
B000O02K2M|5|Perfect fit.
B00FPTMLLM|5|Brung my seats back to life.
B000E43BDK|5|Gasket fit perfect and cured my leaking test pipe issue. Cant beat the price!
B000NJU6Q6|3|awkward to walk in, but work great on the motorcycle.  Had to adjust the shift lever up a bit because boot is thick and kept getting caught, so now works great.  Very tall heel, so I'm not used to that...
B002C7E5FU|5|Love them.
B008VPUJZC|5|bolted up as planned, time will tell on performance.
B0024WQ998|5|very happy !
B005UGRFDE|5|It fit within seconds. Definitely helps with the sunlight.
B0081SRU9W|4|I changed  this unit and the car ran just as bad as before.  Then I put my code reader on and the same old codes were flashing.  While it was running I pushed the clear cades button and the engine smoothed out and purred like a kitten. Auto parts places will read your codes but not clear them out.  If you want it to run right you have to clear the codes.
B001JT1FJ6|5|I run this in every tank !!  More power and most important....better mileage.  My mechanic tells me it will reduce the need for costly injector cleaning so its worth every penny
B000BOC74M|5|I too purchased my Autoclip from the Container Store for $3.99.  It looked as though it would be a handy little gadget to have around and it really is!  My Autoclip is not hanging on my window like the picture shown but attached to the handle above my window. I leave it there so I'll have a place to hang my clothes when I get them from the cleaners versus lying on my car seat so they can slide off onto the floor. The price for this Autoclip is very reasonable and I will be getting another one for my husband's truck.  Even though I paid a little less for the Autoclip, I would have to take the train to get to the Container Store and when you take that into consideration, this is a better price for me.
B0040NJZY0|5|This the best of all worlds.  Inexpensive, got free shipping, and best of all it WORKS!  Installed it in less than 30 minuets and the check engine light went away and so did the slight hesitation in the engine.  Best of all did not have to pay my mechanic $195 to do this simple job.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|works great
B000OXJS1A|5|I bought this for 2006 4 runner fit perfectly.
B008BE02GO|3|they are ok, but not as white as expected
B000C2UIQC|5|Works fine
B007XE8C74|4|arrived at the time indicated when purchased.  easy to operate and saved me several hundred dollars the first day.  easy to use.  Unhappy that I was not informed that the software that accompanied it would only work with windows seven and vista.  This tells me it is an old unit or older model.  If not for that I would probably give it 5 stars.  So far I have not been successful on autel's website at registering it and downloading up to date software.  They don't list this model on the registration site and don't permit it to be put in manually.  Again, this suggests and old model I think but it is still a good little machine. Probably why the price was so good.
B00NEESARY|5|Works Great on my 97 wrangler with no Air.
B000NC0GEU|1|WARNING: DOES NOT WORK IN CALIFORNIA WITHOUT $45 OTC 3358 UPD software update!!!<br /><br />You have been warned - learn from my mistake. OTC has not sold this product in 5 years in California according to company reps.<br /><br />MAC tools has a better product that is less expensive once you factor in the software upgrade required.
B000GZJ2GM|5|Perfect product and great fit. Super easy to install with a bit of normal and reasonable tinkering ('15 Ducati Scrambler). Not the loudest but abolutely gets drivers to look up.
B0036VRQ70|3|worked good
B00FS745EM|3|the lights work, and are red, but the wire leads are wobbly and sometimes have to be repositioned to get them to make contact.  After a couple of weeks 2 of the 5 I installed in my dash appear to have burned out.  Made the dash on my Jeep Wrangler glow red instead of white, which has made a small difference in my night vision.
B00BD9RQHM|2|Incorrect photos to go with description, J-tubes located above heads not as shown in photo going below. Shipping is fast but had to pay return when couldn't use shipped product. Was not my fault :(
B00F5MU9MW|5|Crazy good. Water shot three feet further with same pressure. RV must have.
B00NJRYRQO|5|Excellent
B00HTOLIBK|5|Nice quality; my only wish is that more sizes become available in the future. Essential for any Chuck fan and versatile for indoor or outdoor use!   Update: Nearly a year after I purchased it, this decal still hasn't faded or gotten damaged in the rain or searing Texas sun. I'm still very pleased with its performance on the rear window of my car. Now that I'm switching themes, it's durable enough to peel off easily in one piece.
B001NYYREC|5|Just remember;<br />Yellow line on road is yellow wire for left turn.<br />Green grass on side of road is green wire for right turn.<br />Red is stop.<br />White is power<br />Black is ground.
B000TYTSPK|5|brand new and half the price of previous ones Ive bought that were second hand.  Im impressed
B000276B18|5|it is what it is
B00032KBFE|5|They are screws, and they screwed.
B004FOK8UO|4|Really love these things, just wish they were cheaper.
B006HJ2R18|5|Great
B00UBYQADG|4|The lid rattles when music is playing with standard sound system. I have to remove the lid most of the time because it gets annoying
B00BCN9Z5A|5|Excellent Product.
B008LYEY2W|2|I have had this cover for a while now but it seems to be tearing
B00JBJ3J4U|5|Exactly what I wanted, they work great! You guys are the best. I will continue to shop Amazon and tell everyone I know.
B00EZWQONG|2|Not really worth it if you expect to keep the windows down. With the windows down the shield only cuts down the noise and wind backlash by only 10-15%, regardless of what the video shows. If the product cost was only $30.00- $50.00 well OK then. However, it is a piece of lexan and it does flex so you must  tie it to roll bar tight. The good news (silver lining) is that you can keep it on and top can be raised/closed with no issues-This is especially true if you have the clear version. (Tinted may be a problem for visibility). Over all I give this an &#34;OK&#34; ONLY if you keep windows up, but then again why buy a roadster?
B0039H9PE8|3|They work good
B000PA03AC|5|My daughter loves her 06 Mini Cooper but it had no aux input. Based on Amazon reviews, this cable works for an 06 Mini Cooper. It installed perfectly!!!  You don't even need to remove the radio from the center console. All you need to do is to lower the panel under the steering column. Raise the steering wheel as high as it can go. Place your hand in the space below the wheel and pull out the panel one side at a time. There are two metal clips, one on the left and one on the right. Lower the panel to access the rear of the radio. Feel behind the radio, lower left rear. You will feel a rectangle hole. With the adapter port clip in the up position, plug it in. Easy peasy!!!  Press the mode button on the radio until you get to &#34;AUX&#34;. Connect your device to the aux port, that's all :) I purchased the SoundBot SB360 to connect to the aux input for hands free connect to iPhone for talk and streaming music via Bluetooth. Perfect combo!!!
B000CB24FG|5|Fit perfectly and my truck fired up as soon as I turned the key.  Easy to install.
B00O9UFGOM|1|Piece of junk, now I am out 50 and spending 100 on The Harley-Davidson item!
B00GVW3OS6|1|Not impressed. Thought application would be better.
B008G2YBV8|5|👍🏽
B00JBIA7E6|4|Great looking but the adjustments stick out and can be snagged on, also the light beams are strange looking but over all the lights are a good bargain and look really sharp on the car.
B00BBGMT7Y|5|Works better then expected. Cleans all the nasy mud off
B00B57W30W|4|The dashboard in my husbands van had started to crack, so I ordered the cover to alleviate the problem.  Installed easily, well made, except that it covers the in dash speakers.  You do have to ge used to the slight reflection it makes on the windshield but other than that no problems.  We haven't had it long enough to see it slows down the cracking.
B001F15YC2|5|I put these on my 2011 dodge 4x4 and worked great. it took about 1 hour to install with limited tools needed.
B00X9Y2H8M|4|These are the most awesome stickers! I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HOW THE STICKERS MADE TO SOME STICKERS ARE FUNNY AND WELL MADE! Although I did not like all of them.
B00MXUKYOM|2|The lights looked better than I expected but they were flawed. The silicon was poorly applied and the company should not have shipped them. When I receive my refund I will order a new pair.
B00452EO7Y|1|bought it elsewhere two years ago for my earthquake kit and used it periodically just to make sure it worked.  it worked ok in bright light but not so much on overcast days.  i forgot about it one day and left it outside overnight and now it doesn't work.  That's pretty poor for something that is portrayed as being able to withstand the outdoors and not something I would want to rely upon in my emergency kit.
B00KTHU1QM|5|I love it!!! It was so easy to program took less than 10 min. Best thing ever it locks, unlock and the truck opens I love it!!
B00COYZG4U|3|No idea how good they are... this review is for the way Amazon &#34;fits&#34; parts to your car. That last part deserves a 0 star but the nerf bars themselves may be just fine, hence the 3 star.  The verbiage is wrong where it determines if it will fit your cab or not... these say fits Extended Cab and not Crew Cab. Toyota goes by Access Cab or Double Cab. Bottom line: the Amazon &#34;Does this fit your car&#34; thing doesn't work. I should have done more research. Returning these now because I have an Access Cab. If you're looking for Access Cab nerf bars, it's part 23873007. Be forewarned... the Amazon fit checker will tell you that those are for Regular Cab. Called Lund, they don't care, they said fixing that's on Amazon. Seems to me that Lund has a vested interest in making sure the largest online retailer on the planet's representation of their products is correct. Whatever.
B000WK59PY|5|I love this order. Everything more than expect
B00FY80P6M|5|Exactly  what we  wanted.
B00SRZNIIG|1|Does not fit a 2010 civic.
B00H1I4YSI|4|2002 ram 1500 slt pick up, perfect fit! Great buy definitely $$ well spent and it was inexpensive
B00495UQT2|4|Easy to install. Works fine on our motorhome.
B00XXD32R4|5|A+
B00B8DNL7C|1|Too large and unwieldy even for my RV windows! Threw it away in the end
B00AH04STC|5|Fit great
B00JH0OHMQ|5|Great
B00FEXDVAY|1|Does not fit Subaru WRX 2008 wagon
B00G0P0I60|4|it was great right on time.thank you
B00LTKF34I|5|A/C was blowing hot air, and the dealership was going to charge around 240 bucks to recharge the AC. Wow. I thought I may have a leak and maybe I still do? But I filled it up last night with the A/C running and it's blowing Ice Cold this morning. Of course if it's a bigger leak than what this stuff can handle I may have a problem, but it seems to be doing a good job so far. If my compressor blows up somewhere down the road I will let everyone know, but you just need this and a hose/with gauge to fill up the prius. One can will put you in the middle of the green zone from empty. Great stuff if your prius is just blowing hot air. Just type in Prius A/C recharging on youtube, watch what that guy does and do the same thing. Thinks there's only one video so you'll know which one I'm talking about. I got the blue hose and gauge they recommend buying with this and it fit the prius connection just right.
B00AGWD7VG|2|Slots are too small doesn't even fit standard size vise grip brand needle nose pliers.
B00S1NT2SE|5|Nice set.  Expensive but nice.
B00FIWJUME|5|Your not going to notice any hp increase, unless you pair it with a performance air filter<br />(I went with K&N). It's alot like turning off your ac. But the fitment was great, and it cleans up the engine bay nicely.
B00QDEGP74|5|Would have probably worked but I ruined it putting it on.
B004940ZNK|5|fit like a glove great job.
B005LGYB44|1|DID NOT FIT 2004 DODGE
B009WG296Q|5|This thing works awesome for removing door panels!
B004URMD9A|1|This product is awful and a waste of money.  Does no better of a job than just using water or windex.  Leaves a glare on the window and still looks dirty!
B00IWFI3WW|5|Will this work for my 2014 Hyundai Genesis 2.0t Rspec???
B00GSAUHB8|5|Exactly as described. Thank you so much!
B00P1TDM28|5|Use it at work and wish I would have purchased sooner. I will be ordering 2 more for at home.
B00MR74AEG|5|got it fast, just as ordered, had no problems, first thing I did was open it to see if it had a battery. it did. then I read not to open it looking for a battery it has one. minimal paperwork but not much is needed. the instructions were enclosed, went online and found two methods of programming, the second worked. need to have a little patience waiting for response from vehicle. programmed new one and old one, now I have two.<br />GREAT PRODUCT at a FANTASTIC PRICE !!!
B00B9O3AH6|5|Top of the line.
B005FNVXSU|5|I put these on a 1991 Acura Integra LS coupe, made the car look great and the handling is much tighter, no body roll. Perfect first upgrade for stock suspension.
B002759DH2|5|Very well made. I bought this for my husbands Ram and he loves it.
B000C9PNII|5|GOOD....GOT ON TIME......EXCELLENT....
B007TG7HXG|2|Lasted about a year before starting to make loud squeaky noises with a pretty limited amount of use.  Pretty disappointing that these did not last longer.
B0049TZZTY|5|Great price and direct connect was great
B000C2CAFO|5|very good
B00THRMSCA|3|I bought this product because I thought it would good for the rainy days and when the Monsoon storms pass through. I live in Arizona and I am afraid to use it in direct sunlight with temps around 110 to 120 because of the heat build-up. So for now I still find the nearest tree or any shade structure.
B000C31J9G|5|Perfect fit, great deal.
B002JFQFNA|5|Great sunglasses!
B000MSDKMA|1|Died after 3 months.
B006B285S0|5|Along with the MD615 brake rotor that I got for my BMW  R1200CL,  the pads stop my bike.  What more can a guy ask?
B00U7B3KXG|5|The timing chain came in the perfect size, I've purchased many other GOOFIT products in the past and have not been disappointed so far. I replaced the timing chain on my son's Go Kart, and it's been running smoothly ever since. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a new chain for their Go Kart.
B009FZWF3Q|5|Works as needed
B0012TRMZE|3|Neat item, but required trimming to fit my 2004 Yamaha Rhino.
B000G72UOQ|5|Too big so gave it to a neighbor who has a large SUV and they love them
B00BQYCIVI|5|these towels are great. They hold a lot of water and wring out easy. They don't scratch the paint.
B00PJHSE2K|2|One of the buttons was broken so i had to use one from my old key.
B0081H7E58|5|Dropped this into my 2002 Silverado 2wd 4.8L with a 4L60e trans.<br /><br />It took a lot of research on my part to clear this up...but for your convenience, here are the facts:<br />This kit will ONLY affect the 1-2 shift<br />If you want to hold 4th longer...you need a different kit, you need the 4th hold plate.<br /><br />If you are looking to clean the sloppy stock 1-2 shift, this is it.<br /><br />Took about 45 minutes to install.<br /><br />Take special note on how everything looks when it comes out...it MUST go back in exactly the same or it will NOT function properly.<br /><br />Overall a great product. It works and feels solid!
B000J44710|5|Great saddlebags!  They fit on a 2013 Suzuki Gladius just fine (though you won't be able to have a passenger as well).  You end up sitting on the very edge of the padding that is between the bags and your bike.
B005J949D6|5|It done the trick
B00IPS0LI0|5|Interesting little gadget.  Easy to operate.  More practical than a lighter.  Thus far I've only used it to light wood chips on the BBQ, but I can see many more uses for it.  I really only have two complaints about it.  First, being a MINI torch, the flame is tiny in length.  That means your hand is going to get up close and personal with whatever you're torching.  Be cautious and wear a heat resistant glove when possible.  My second beef is that this didn't come with butane, which is inconvenient because I had to try and find someone that sold butane refills, and nobody seems to do that anymore (I had to purchase butane on Amazon!); plus the lack of butane upon delivery puts the torch on the pricey side for what you get (IMO).  That said, it's real simple to operate.  Usually takes me two tries of the piezzo trigger before it will light, but that's fine.  Has a safety lever, so it is next-to-impossible to light accidentally; I wouldn't go so far as to say it's child proof (because the safety lever locks in the disabled position), but it's still a nice feature.  You can lock the flame in the 'on' position so you don't have to continually hold down the trigger once lit.  And even though I have to admit that I forgot about this, there is a little slide on the side of the unit that allows you to adjust the flame; and the reason I forgot about it is because I haven't needed to use it yet.  The middle position is pretty much all you need (at least on mine).  It's really hard for me to give this thing a 5-star rating, because something inside me is telling me that it isn't... but I've racked my brain for a reason NOT to give it 5 stars, and I can't come up with one.  Yeah, I mentioned a couple of things above, but those don't really warrant the loss of a star.  Maybe when I start expanding its uses (e.g. soldering, shrink wrapping, etc) I can change my opinion about it; but right now it seems to be a surprisingly good tool.
B00DSD5ASS|5|My sons favorite character, they should make more R2-D2 products.
B0055QOKC8|2|Eh.....it does work but it is hard to use with one hand.
B00GY55VJA|1|Terrible. nothing but problems in the last 60 days. 1 ballast went bad. company replaced, then another bulb went a few days later. when turning on lights, i get a flash of the lowbeams and then they go out. i drive with the high beams on then switch to get the low beams to work and its almost 50/50 if they go on. Annoying for my explorer to keep showing errors that left turn signal is out, then right signal out. resetting this daily is really annoying. I am patient and want these to work, but amazon also says these are compatible for my vehicle. Not really true since the computer doesn't really recognize them. It's hit or miss and never know at night if I need to use brights, either i am going to be a cyclops because only one is working etc. I cannot recommend them for my ford explorer. I am quite a technical person and this Disappointed and a waste of money. Cannot Recommend. 1 star is the lowest i can go.
B00EEQNTKY|5|worked great!  Little scrubbing when it was time for them to come off window and not problems.  Live in Arizona and they did not fade in 115 degree plus weather on black car!
B00DYZH8LW|1|I purchase this lock to use as a helmet lock during my 38 day trip to Alaska an back.  The lock didn't survive the trip.<br />I purchase a Harley lock in Seattle that looked just like this lock and it didn't survive the trip either.  The lock fell apart on the Alaska Highway even though it wasn't under any pressure at the time.
B001HKZHIW|4|VERY tight fit.  Good and bad.  Two female connectors broke off when just trying to put it on by hand.  I was sent another one, filed the female connections just a hair and put on some Vaseline and had a nice fit.  Easy to set up and works very well.
B000COOM08|5|MSD quality is hard to beat.
B0126YHORE|5|These bulbs are wonderful. They are a standard replacement for a T10 921 bulb and are great because they have such low power consumption. I wanted these mainly because of their longevity and low cost. Items arrived undamaged and were exactly as described.<br /><br />&#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review. I am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.&#34;
B00HNMLQAG|3|I'm still not sure why I even bought these.  At least I have them if I need them.  But I don't ever take apart my car.
B00GGVM2JE|5|Great Product - Original Equipment - Fast shipping and exactly as described.
B00D3298A0|5|Fantastic, perfect for the car and my feet
B0009IQZH0|5|Good product, good price
B000GD5FMY|4|fit ok
B005XRM5DU|5|Fits well look great😃😃
B005FL28YU|5|Excellent, delivery was overnight with me only specifying 2 days.  Amazing.  Great job here.  These brakes are very much better than OEM.  They go on super tight with the new rotor in place, very snug and very nice.  Remember to put some brake noise grease cancellor on the back of the pads.  You don't need much.  Just a little bit will do the trick.  I have zero noise in terms of sqeeking or anything like that.  The brakes are about 20% stronger than stock OEM's.  They really bring this truck to a halt and quick.  Also, make sure you have someone flush and fill your brake lines.  You do NOT want to be running old, disgusting, dirty colored brake fluid.  If you're going to change up the brakes and pads and rotors, you might as well go the extra mile and change out all the fluid.  I don't mean to just bleed the brakes, i mean have someone hookup a BG machine to it, and flush out all that crud and junk and air in the lines.  New brake fluid will help tremendously with your new brakes and that cannot be understated.  Very pleased with this mod.  The old rotors were warped badly.  The brake pads were worn uneven.  That's because the moron who did the last brake job on the vehicle neglected to grease up the cottor pins.  make sure those babies are greased up real nice and good when you are doing you're brakes.  That makes every bit of difference in the world.  If they are not greased up, the will seize and your pads won't be able to float around properly.  Also, do NOT over tighten the cotton pin bolt.  Should be 10 lbs torque max.  The brake caliper bracket should be around 50 lbs max.  Don't go all gorilla on these parts with overtightenting.  you're doing yourself a major disservice.  Thanks.
B00AY8PGI4|1|Not to happy with the product  already the adhesive is not applying to the  rim and the color  is coming off the tape
B00AYI1GE2|5|I love it (:
B00VGL5SVI|5|Bought this so the wife could haul our fishing boat with her SUV. Did'not realize that this was LONGER than the normal hitches - glad it was. It stuck out far enough so it would'not get near her bumper. That's a plus!
B006FXGSOI|5|These are terrific!  I had to replace both fog lights on my Mercedes CLK350 because rocks broke them.  Since installing these fog light covers, no more broken fog lights!
B00N7F0JOC|5|very good
B00XB2NGW8|5|Purchased for the car of  a Peyton Manning fan.  She loved it.
B0066RKVL4|5|This is an exact replacement for the cupholder on my BMW 540i! The dealer wanted $160 plus labor to install it, I was able to remove the old one and install the new one in less than a half an hour.
B00WYV8NOI|5|This unit is a high quality unit. I am very pleased as to how well it is made. It does everything that I expected of it and more. I don't need a radio or a compressor but it is there and it works well. I probably will order a higher wattage unit from Wagan which does not have all the frills.
B002AP95H2|5|Nice
B005DGNGB6|5|excelent
B000CJ8DC6|5|Do the job well and it's been more than a year.
B00SXKS9FW|5|It fit well and I love it
B00GR2WANA|5|The decal is awesome! I hope we know how to put it on because it didn't come with instructions.
B00852QTIC|5|Works great
B004ZO3VN0|5|My bike has borderline to high of compression. It is a Vintage big Single. Running on Premium even with the timing retarded it Pinged all the time. Added about 6 ounces to my 4 gallon tank and, wow what a difference!! running smooth and lots of power!
B007TY7K4E|5|Great product, fast delivery, just as described.
B008S79R9M|5|love it
B007HG7Y7M|5|As shown
B00E9CZLF4|4|Nice Decal but this one doesn't look like the original autobot icon.
B007G2KSUW|5|Best boat cleaner ever
B00OBWR0V0|2|Nice but way too small for the price
B001LRJHFK|5|Use this on all my bikes.
B000CRAXU8|4|Nice easy to install  as well
B00NWQ9LG8|5|Looks great on both my vehicles!
B007IWE8QU|5|Nice and works as described
B00062YJCC|5|Great finish on product, I installed it on my 2005 Vulcan 1600 classic and looks as if it was made for the bike. Large response in power almost immediately after install
B000E4OJRW|5|works great
B002QSD3YE|5|Fit was pretty good only required a little bit of tweaking. Sounds great.
B00P3GD9OU|1|Arrived damaged
B00XVS8XNE|5|If you are working on a Honda you will need these.  My CRV is 15 years old and the clips just fall apart when you try to remove them....
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Great value.  Decent construction.  Bright Lights.
B001G4Z5NQ|5|Works great. Perfect addition to an already great product.
B004J5CV4A|5|Strong, easy to fit, wears well and has enough tie down clamping area to hold the wheels in place.
B001CEG90I|3|This filter reduce the fan airflow to the cabin
B00WRV96G4|4|As adveritsed
B002XL4ZHS|5|Great fit and great price. The color matches the car nicely
B00KCQSOAA|5|Seat covers came in a great amount of time! 2 days and they were here! They are really nice, and I can't wait to show them off! They were for a gift for my sister! The company was very helpful!
B007WR25GG|5|Used it for a camping trip recently.  Worked great and as advertised.  It didn't rain on our trip, so I can't comment to the water resistance of the product, but was easy to install and load, even out at camp.  My Dodge journey only has side rails and it installed perfectly.  It might have been a little quieter if I could have strapped front to back, but wasn't bad.
B00F9RNIPI|5|These are heavy duty, well made and come in a convenient bag. They are easy to wrap back up and stow away.
B005O52JQ4|5|The helmet looks good and is very comfortable. I'm happy with it.
B006N9HD4I|5|2004 Ford Focus ZX3 with 2.3l motor.  I thought the steering was tight and nice before these were installed - I am blown away how nice things are now, though.  Also got rid of an obnoxious shimmy at around 70 MPH.  Now however, I am going to have to replace the bushings in the back as the mushiness there has become apparent as the front end is nice and tight for hugging curvy NC roads.  Car has 200k these replaced what I believe were the OEM ones, expect they will last very long.
B002N5W8Q4|1|Now I see what earlier reviewers meant when they asked how they were supposed to get the batteries in.  They really don't fit. But my real issue is that THIS ITEM IS DANGEROUS!  After getting the batteries in (mostly in) one battery began heating up.  I didn't even have the switch turned on.  Within 3 minutes, the battery was so hot, I could barely touch it.  I finally pried it out with a screwdriver.  I'm sure if I had left it in, it would have either started a fire or exploded.  I then tried the batteries in a flashlight, and there was no problem with them heating up.  I've never had this kind of problem with any device ever.  By the way, yes, the polarity was right
B00NGHLY4U|5|Can't believe I didn't buy these sooner. My Xterra back door didn't stay up for years and after buying these and spending 10 MINUTES replacing, my back door works great.
B00PHPPAAI|5|Very strong and very well built.  My Hayabusa and I combined weigh in around 850 lbs. and this ramp doesn't struggle a bit.  The weight is good too.  And I really like the fact that it has the 'hump' towards the end to prevent the bike from bottoming out.<br /><br />I did make some modifications though.  I really wanted a 4-ft wide ramp so that I could have footing going up and down the trailer, but I didn't want to spend $400+ dollars on one of those ramps.  So I bought this one because it had the weight capacity and welded to it to have areas for footing.  Mission accomplished and I saved hundreds of dollars.<br /><br />PS - My father recently used my ramp to transport his Honda VTX 1300, which is a combined weight of 950 lbs, and the ramp still performed perfectly fine.
B00LG6CYII|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B002X6VXL4|5|Seems to be a perfect fit for my needs.  The compressor was a benny!
B00GFTTNNA|5|Perfect. I put on my wrangler 2011. All ok
B008G3A5SU|5|Working well.
B00DYSISF4|3|Clear Covers fit well but 3 stickons is not enough to secure the covers to headlights, the company only sent 3 each you need 5 atleast to keep the covers on during travel.
B00N2BZCZM|2|did the job i need it to do. the plastic end caps for the bars will fall off driving down the road. No instructions in the box, the main thing that was hard to figure out which what door piece to put which required trial and error.
B00OU5LOT2|5|This product is awesome the only bad thing about it is that I lost the remote really fast .
B007ZLL3P8|5|right item for the price,work as described.
B000VTLJBE|5|The best out there. Came on time
B0062IJQEA|5|Highly recommend this fuel door. Previously I had this in chrome and was a big mistake. This one is black and powder coated, should last!<br /><br />Do not buy this fuel door in chrome!!  The chrome peels off in a few months.
B0052O8EY8|3|What no instructions? Luckily I am mechanically inclined and could do the install.
B00FI7LW0C|5|Product as described and included installation instructions..  Genuine SeaDoo part.  Quick delivery.
B00BQYCKE8|1|They are made entirely of man made material which will melt if you touch any hot part causing more mess to clean than when you started!
B002MNPL8O|1|Didn't go on right. Had to throw it in the trash. I read the directions. May not have done it correctly.
B00FS93LZO|5|Fits perfect on my duramax!!!
B003KFLETI|5|appear to be much heavier built than OEM, Fit was excellent, good quality. Now to see how they perform on the road
B00W8LQLGQ|5|Everything I hoped for
B000JZMZIG|5|Great quality easy install
B00BVE07UC|5|Great item. Received quickly and as expected.
B000SP5YUS|5|Great for working with jewelry
B00M9NKBJG|3|I am only giving this boot 3 stars due to personal preference. This boot is very durable, the latches work remarkably well, they are very comfortable and when they say size 11 they mean size 11. They are too heavy for my preference and the toe area is way too thick. Probably a great track boot. Not a good harescramble boot.
B009EDOPW8|5|Every new driver should have this to warn other drivers
B000BYGE3M|5|Perfect fit
B004GE9J8A|3|The bumper extension not of the same quality but it was fine for a 26 year old car
B00OYR7PVC|1|I only purchased these because the end cap fell off the throttle grip of the first set I bought. Very disappointing.  This time I'll be using thread lock and a pipe wrench.
B008SEBQ2G|1|Got 1st antenna, and my radio stations had alot of static, so got 2nd antenna and had same issue. Not worth the money.
B000CPIOAG|5|good for back of pads and any metal caliper  bracket metal contact surfaces.
B0081ZYS4K|5|very good, really help full
B003E7LJNI|5|better quality then I expected and excellent packaging
B004GCUBIY|5|Easy to install. Very good value...now when my girlfriend knocks this one off backing out of the garage I'll have no problem replacing it again.
B00CMLRNGY|5|Very detailed and well made
B00E4ZBX12|5|Love my jeep mats
B000CODKLA|2|2 star's because it chokes if I drop the peddle and i've read I would have to make modification on it for it to solve the problem like bore it out to fit my throttle body properly
B00348KSMK|5|I love this dove - the quality is good - colors are bright and it really looks good on my car window
B002IQ8VMI|5|Excellent
B000BVP20Q|5|Thank you
B002WGKOSI|2|Very cool product, BUT not for anyone that is XL or bigger.
B00877SL2M|5|Excellent product. Super bright plug & play bulbs. Super fast delivery
B00F4MQJ5O|1|Just installed sunday 8/16 and now tuesday 8/18 the right side flood section is out.  Get what ya pay for.
B00DL4NSM4|4|good quality fast shipping
B00062ZD5E|5|Works just right for return pressure
B0023VP02C|5|Amazing! The item came about 3 days earlier than expected. And it also came with its own bulb. Which was a nice surprise.
B003NNIP8K|5|Great quality tip, packed carefully meaning it was delivered with no dents!
B000GOG3R4|5|Exactly what was needed and expected, expeditious delivery......
B000C9DGZ0|5|worked perfectly as it should,arrived on time and was priced right . thanks
B009KTAZF2|1|IT was way to small it was not a a one size fits all.
B00BJI9SVE|1|This broke as my husband was screwing it in and we now need to replace the engine. Poorly made. Very disatisfied.
B001TK7CYM|1|Very disappointed they are not the original Red Barron.
B00HSO37B0|5|Has worked as advertised, worth the $$$, a real back saver.
B00HJAYPQY|5|great fit
B000E28CBS|5|The nut on the filter makes it so much easier to remove.  I'll continue to use these filters
B000KOVJK6|5|Excellent, this meter works flawlessly and is very easy to install.
B00AWE0FQI|5|Very nice for the money
B00G258GPI|5|Great fire, easy to use
B000RFUF12|5|Great little tool.  Love It.
B007MUY76O|5|This was exactly what my husband needed for his leer camper.
B00B0DGRF8|5|These are just what I needed , priced right and they seem well made no distortion, Would buy again!
B00FPL0LV2|5|Perfect fit, just like oem. Saved hundreds buying this on amazon. YouTube video helped me install it in no time flat.
B007R4GQ5U|5|OK it all!
B00EK5F4YI|1|Smaller than oem set. Poor quality. Bottom passenger light would not clip in, just fell out. Didn't even try installing drivers side.
B006571Q5A|1|It just did not work. Attached it to my emergency generator, then to my 4 wheeler. Moved the sites just in case it wasn't vibrating enough and NOTHING. Zero. Mine may be an exception but its mine. Bought two induction hour meters that came and worked. Induction hour meters are much cheaper and induction is a proved. Sorry I wanted to get fancy.
B00AKQAD88|5|This is such a great lanyard! I always have people wanting one I even had to buy my friend one cause she just HAD TO HAVE IT!
B0000AXMDP|3|It's Ok.
B004GCSWOE|5|Fit perfectly
B002MB4FV0|4|Working well. Last headlights were barely transparent so major improvement. With the help of YouTube how-to video, had it done in a few hours. Good buy, worked as expected.<br />I never give anything 5 stars. Maybe if it installed itself I would.
B00BQAJXVK|5|Good price
B0010DXYJU|5|Just installed a couple of weeks ago in a Toyota and it is working fine.
B00295T6G8|5|Delivery and product met expectations.
B00CXMPR2E|1|Cute sticker but too hard to apply. Lines are to thin they rip when trying to apply. Very frustrating
B0066QQM9A|2|This is a softer rubber than the OEM.  It makes it easier to install but it did not hold up well.  Mine only lasted 18 months and 6000 miles before developing cracks.
B001C6Q34S|5|Exactly what I needed for my 2015 Subaru Forester. And at a fraction of the cost at the dealer. Extremely easy to install as well. Took me 3 minutes.
B000WJAH5M|5|easy to get on, work great for big hands especially!!
B000E3GHE6|5|Great seat covers. Look exactly like the photo!
B00C2SU2XI|5|Could not ask for a better result. My boyfriend loves it. No mushroom head, perfect fit.
B00C4XFMO0|5|good product
B00NF17LBM|5|Perfect drop in replacement for my missing window cranks from the previous owner installing an aftermarket power window system.
B00NHRRWP4|5|looks fantastic
B00CEPV94U|5|I have a 04 Passat GLX 4motion wagon. I bought this because I couldn't find one in town that was even close to the price. It took me all of 2 minutes to install and works great.
B008G4Y076|5|Work excellent and very bright for reverse lights!
B000TYSJIM|1|Item shipped promptly and was easy to install after watching a YouTube video. It worked great for the last 2.5 years but the old &#34;jerky&#34; steering has retuned. It usually occurs when accelerating onto the highway from an on ramp or when exiting the highway on an off ramp. On my truck it is intermittent and only happens when turning right. Will reorder an ACDelco part this year time as I'm starting to find that electrical components last longer from ACDelco as opposed to Chinese aftermarket lesser expensive products. The factory original in this case lasted for nearly 15 years. Hope this helps someone else.
B001PGWXZS|5|Only used once, work excellent.<br /><br />Sylvester lewis
B0021HFUFU|5|Perfect for small jobs. Cleanup a breeze! I use small marbles for shakers in my mixture.
B000EB9W4U|5|I've had this on my HHR for 95000 miles.  Still going strong
B00AKDQ7S6|5|Excellent product.He gave a beautiful look to the car
B001PO9HQS|5|Works great. You pay for the research but it is well worth it. I bought this kit for my klx450r. Used their chart and jetted for my area with yoshimira pipe & k&N filter. Ran great.  Went to higher elevation and again jetted according to their chart. ran perfect.
B004OFNJZ0|3|Seems to thin to make a different, but it noticeably kept my car cooler. I have a Subraru Crosstrek and I think I should've gotten the bigger size.  It takes a bit of work to figure out how to position these to stay because they were too small for my car. Love the print though.
B0044Z8NME|5|I have been using this product for several years.  It is excellent.
B010SPPV1E|3|The outer housing component (gas door frame) does not fit seamlessly or flush up against the back panel of jeep,  but still looks decent. Quality product.
B002SVHD0O|5|fit perfectly, arrived as promised.
B009VGEEM4|5|Good service. Met expectations!
B00GWEU166|5|bulbs work great
B00FMV28WK|5|Dress my truck up nicely.
B00M1WD2SW|5|Perfect!
B00EDGQDPI|4|the bracket for the adjuster interfered with the hood closing. had to grind some of bracket away so hood will close properly. otherwise, they work and look great. much better light pattern and road coverage than original lights.
B00BN442IS|4|Nice key chain  for the price.  Quick shipping.  Hopefully it holds up for quite a while.  May come back to raise to 5 stars.  It seems just a little cheap but time will tell.
B000WJFBQ2|5|Very nice.
B00B85BTTM|4|Bought  4 for my 2011 HHR. They look great-some thought they were rims especially due to the 5 spoke steel wheels underneath.<br />Only one thing--the factory covers would always shift around and make noise because the covers would not lock up when the nuts were tightened.<br />The new rims had to be pushed in about 1/4 inch to get the plastic nuts to grab the thread on the lug nuts. Is this eventually going to cause the cover to crack. I am enjoying the silence when I hit a bump with the new covers, but is that normal????
B009TDFXR4|5|Great for my I-phone unfortunately I can only see the screen in the evening hours. I guess we can call that a benefit since my eyes should be glued to the road
B00W2EQ128|5|Best customer service ever ! Good quality
B00032KC3K|5|Fit nice and look good.
B007DPI0AM|2|Bumper does not fit 2500 HD. I had to take the brackets off the old bumper to make it work
B001GXWIE6|5|Arrived quickly.  Nice product, easy to apply. Would use this company again.
B00HH3JWOS|1|cheaply made.
B0065WW3F2|5|As always, a great product for your harley
B00N18CKTM|4|work very well
B0096PRFC6|5|fast shipping great product, will defiantly come back shopping again....
B000N3W8J0|5|Great product easy to use, works as designed.
B00AKEM09K|5|Easy installation, the ATV works great now.
B007WR25ES|4|Just bought this and while I have used it yet. It has exceeded my expectations for size. As seen in my pics I fit two suitcases two sleeping Bags a toy bag and a Valco Jogging stroller with room to spare.
B004AIHKT2|5|Made of metal, so much stronger than the flimsy plastic part the vehicle came with.  We haven't had any shifting issue since we have replaced this part.
B00M12AQPO|1|On my first order, I recieved 2 bulbs out of which 1 was dead on arrival. Great. The one that worked looked amazing so I ordered a replacement. Took a while but it came. When it came, out of the 2 new ones, one came with a broken cap. Great.   For me to make use of them, I am now using the 2 working bulbs from the 2 orders .... definitely not worth the hassle and price. If you are looking to buy these, be ready for a lot of returns and replacements. For 30 bucks, you should be expecting working bulbs not broken and shattered glass. Although it wasnt a surprise since it came in the worst packaging. Thanks iJDMTOY for a waste of my time, I really appreciate it!
B008FCE7C2|3|Good purchase for the money about $60 less than dealer. Only issue is once installed the locking clamps don't stay down all the way. Easy fix is to wrap some electrical tape around them. Drove 350 miles with a full cargo box and it was just fine that way. Says it's original GM part but I'm not convinced.  That being said it was still worth the money.
B009O4S1QI|4|Product is good, directions are pretty clear...just take your time and watch a uTube video as you go. Top metal cover is VERY difficult to use, and I question the functionality of this top metal cover the next time I have to remove/clean the filter.
B00BHIA2XO|5|Very happy with the purchase. The quality and sound is great. I was previously using a TurboXS RFL catback with my full exhaust and equal length headers and it sounded like RFL clacky crap. This cleaned things up and dropped it a few decibel but opens up nicely with no apparent loss due to restriction. Definitely happy with the purchase and I received it quickly.
B0041WOEYG|5|Installed it today. Delivery was prompt and it works perfectly. Thank you.  Edit: Lasted 1 year and 2 days. I guess it's great if you don't mind replacing it every year.
B00IMUC9YU|3|The steering wheel cover fit my new Honda Civic LX however it never glowed in the dark as stated.  I do like the blue color to match the color of my car and it does keep the steering wheel cool in the heat.
B00NRLCIR2|2|too small - need a German badge I can put on the car grill
B002W2A108|5|Served its purpose.  Not much to it!
B00KWMI5KS|5|They are a great product recommend any time
B007IDI3E2|5|High quality!
B007P745UC|5|just as advertised, perfect fit for my 07 cruiser, back on the road again.
B0009X8LYK|5|It's the best crew color in Bonfar.
B008RUINI6|5|it's a choke, it did it's thing.
B009YM3ZIY|5|OEM and perfect! exactly fit my 2013 cx-5. Coloring was perfect too! These are super thick and look like they will last more than the lifetime of the car.
B006FLMGZA|5|Fits good if installed properly. Good quality. Fit close to window about 1 inch gap but maintains aerodynamics of car
B0036R6IT6|5|Very nice unit. Lots a storage.
B00GJXBTOI|5|Love the looks
B006WPQMOA|4|It's exactly what I wanted. Well built. It flushes. Hasn't leaked yet. Arrived before expected. Better than two generic off brands that leaked horribly. This unit works exactly as expected.
B0016KG778|4|These are decent reflectors, with a fairly strong adhesive backing.  The adhesive is on a thin layer of foam rubber, allowing for slight unevenness or 'roughness' on the surface you are sticking them to.  I've seen reflectors that are made with thicker material, that would probably be stronger and more durable, but not for $1 per reflector.  The package said they were made in Taiwan.
B00HQLTWCI|5|Good quality
B000CIRA0S|5|Worked good on my 94 z28 5.7lt1camaro
B0000AXU02|5|Seem to be well made and do the job they are intended for, at a very reasonable cost.
B00HFWYZO8|4|It fits good on my car!!!! I love it!
B000C2S9UO|5|obscure dart for my old fj 40  . A much better price than toyota
B00G2U0LHY|5|very bright
B00T74VX24|4|It is very good , delivery fast . No complaints
B00Q5M8FTU|4|The stickers look good but the plastic seems a little thin.
B00SX68Z9Q|5|Looks much cooler than stock offering.  Much more affordable than other sources.
B0028OH766|5|Quality Item! I would suggest to everyone to purchase. Item came when expected, and packaging was good.
B000CRVFYQ|5|fit and worked on a 1998 lexus es300
B0007WP6B4|5|great
B0045LCU80|5|The best product I've tried for a convertible window. My window is clear so I'm not sure if it'll remove yellowing but it does clean it well. It seems like you waxed the plastic window without the residue.
B0063MHY9Y|5|Hubby and I installed these by ourselves in around 30 minutes and they look and work great.  Gave our car a little &#34;facelift&#34;.
B00LVVVHP4|3|Poor finish and no instructions what so ever on how to install it.
B00W8LG67A|2|they fit well the finishing was a bit lacking but thats to be expected for the price. first time on the highway the rear two flew off at 75. if you stay in the city their great but at highway speeds they take flight and rip off the door
B00279UMMI|3|Nice idea but my husband never uses it. Inconvenient when there are passengers.
B00REXOUKC|5|Good.
B00KZN6MCW|4|Great Product
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Sunshade arrived super quickly and looks just as described.<br /><br />I like the fact it stays together and is not two separate pieces.
B00KSYUKFS|5|Came fast and I'm not a pro installing the wrap but with the help of 2-3 people the job can be done right! Didn't leave any bubbles or rips I used a squeege that I got from Amazon for 5$ came in handy and I also bought an exacto knife to cut out the wrap, overall it took about 1-2 hours to complete
B000RX9KDS|1|not for a 1998 this will not fit your car
B004OI3OWK|1|🇳🇴🇹 🇸🇴<br />🇬🇷🇦🇹🇪
B006FXGCTO|1|Unfortunately did not meet my expectations, the fog light cover diameter is too small than the fog light of my car..<br />Not satisfied of the product .. Sorry 😔😔
B0040M30U6|5|nice look on my black silverado, blacked out nicely
B00K8HJQIC|1|Missing parts poor customer service.<br />Save yourself time just order the kit right from Harley it has all the parts need to get the job done this kit is poor at best
B00B8SYNUQ|3|Just received mine so I don't have an adequate review yet - I will update once I've had it for a couple months.  It is a tad short on the sides but not by a huge amount and really not noticeable unless up close. Here are some pics
B00D568AN0|5|Works great.
B0077BT5L0|4|Came in today, color is a perfect match, would've loved some instructions though.
B002X6DQUA|5|pigtail is as advertised. thanks
B00TEFM24Y|5|Product is very well made and works great.  It arrived on time and was easy to install.  Would recommend if you have the same problematic Chevy Impala door locks.  Only took about 30 mins to install.
B000ZRW78Q|2|Works perfect for my 2 6inch light bars. Thus switch turns them off an on up to 25 ft away. There's no lag at all in the switch. As soon as u hit the on button the lights turn on. An amazing product might purchase another for other things I might wanna add to my van.<br /><br />***UPDATE**** 06/04/2016<br />I should of updated this already but the control kit quit working after three weeks of use. I'm guess moisture got inside of the control module and fried it. I later bought a better control kit for $35 and it works a lot better and haven't had any problems with using it compared this garbage. save your money and get the better one for more.
B002B8GUY4|5|Good product
B00I6T1WRW|4|I that was bigger
B000IYY7SO|5|Installed on 2006 Pontiac Vibe along with new Professional Durastop Rotor. Good replacement for OEM. Performed great after seated. No noise.
B003WM9RZW|5|Best stuff you will ever find for your RV.
B00SYS46HI|5|It looks great and matches the interior nicely. The scent is pleasant and unique.
B007EZ37XQ|5|This piece was what was preventing our vehicle from passing smog.  Awesome price, over $100 less than the local parts stores and dealerships.  Vehicle passed smog without a hitch.
B00HUGND6K|4|cool
B007Y558EM|5|Great fit, fantastic heat reduction. Well worth the price.
B0068ODC1Q|5|Great cover, cheaper then dealer.
B000GTXNYK|5|Seemed to install/fit much nicer than the All Balls alternative.<br />Using on a 2007 KX450F.
B007OW62V8|5|Fit 2014 prius perfectly.
B003IS3HV0|4|I expected a bit more shine to the leather but that was my expectation and not the fault of the product.  I've only used it once.  I'm guessing it will help preserve my boots and shoes so will see.  It is easy to apply.  Quite thick because of the honey and make sure you use a LINT free cloth.
B005EPLKZU|5|This looks great on the dash with the little silver accent on the switch. Installs perfectly and works perfectly. I like the fact that I can turn on the parking lights separately from the headlights, if I had to, and I have additional options for fog lights (front and rear). Even if I don't run wiring to the rear fog lights (which are built-into my existing 2003 VW Jetta taillights without any wiring), I can still use that switch-stop position to control another lighting circuit, such as aftermarket DRL.
B004BWU8H8|5|This is a nice lockable box.  Seems sturdy and good value for the money.  Bought one for both sides.
B00AEBAF8W|5|I can finally see out the rearview now.
B00S5FH77Q|5|Great covers for your license plate frame...highly recommended...A++++++
B00W5MG8XY|5|This is a solid, well made item that should last a long time. The hammer, lights and belt cutter are a great bonus.
B00X1230TM|3|it works good 50/50 mix
B00BEIUHMI|4|Fits snugly
B004EG5D08|5|My second MSD box, couldn't be happier with my choice of MSD ignitions. First one is over 10 years old and works like day one. Easy install and makes a noticeable difference starting, and in general.
B002EM5IYK|5|I got this a day early and I also got a sticker and a business card.
B001O08ADO|4|Arrived on time and packaged well. Fit xterra factory rims/ studs.
B00CSVCNW2|5|I don't drink wine, and am pretty much temperate about the consumption of alcohol, and always thought &#34;what good use am I going to get out of the corkscrew?&#34;  Every Swiss Army Knife I've bought had the Phillips on the backside until the Explorer.<br /><br />I'd lost the toothpick in my secondhand Craftsman, and ordered a pack of three that also included this tool.  I needed the corkscrew for cleaning a Big Bang Cannon (as to hold a vinegar-soaked cotton ball, and that the knockoff SAK clone with a corkscrew I had didn't work well), and I also wanted to try out the inline Phillips and Magnifier so I settled upon the Explorer.<br /><br />This tool fits right into the Explorer's corkscrew by simply screwing in.<br /><br />It has had several redesigns over the years, with 2009's being the most drastic.  Instead of the rounded design (as currently shown), they switched to a hexagonal design.  Many say it comes out easier accidentally, but I've never had it do that.  I prefer the hexagonal design, as for one, it won't roll off a surface as easily, and secondly, the hexagonal handle is almost perfectly 1/4&#34;, allowing it to fit into a 1/4 inch bit driver.<br /><br />It will fit all kinds of small screws, but I have it on my Explorer in case my eyeglass frame screws securing the lens come loose again, and I can't find the small Teeny Turner screwdriver I keep as my main precision screwdriver.<br /><br />For a couple dollars or so, I recommend adding this if you plan to purchase a corkscrew-equipped SAK.  You won't regret it!
B00WMD8BAE|1|Put light on rim of bike and it works intermittently  not happy with product, tried to contact company  and jut have a email, not happy
B00BRHM8FA|5|Got this for my 2011 jeep wrangler jk. I only used it for changing my tire size. Product is very easy to use and can be expanded for tuning by purchasing additional program on Superchips website. This is a great product!
B0002JMFMK|5|as good as any
B009D3JJGQ|5|Great fit and function for my Chevy Volt.
B00D6YI7CA|5|Fits great on my Nissan Rogue2008.
B00OY41LY2|5|Just as expected! Quick shipping!
B00DRYPIVM|3|lower bolts snapped before i could get them to torque specs and included dirrections were in readable i couldnt figure out what it was saying so got out my haynes manual and followed it instead since ive installed them the ride of my truck seems much more firm and much less body roll
B001KS2PXQ|4|Fits perfectly and works like a charm
B009RPFMP2|1|This is a (WAY OVERPRICED) way to make a connection . If you plan to be hooking up a temporary electrical connection I guess it serves as a reusable crimp. does not make a good permanent solution though. And its made very cheaply VERY small and threads will strip easily if you try to tighten to much. Also the end caps you screw on to tighten the wires down are EXTREMELY small and easy to lose. And if you lose one of the caps the connector becomes USELESS and for a buck or more a piece that can become a real expensive problem....SAVE  your money these are way too expensive and M/O a bad choice for an electrical connection.
B00HE91E8W|5|I have an automotive repair shop. These save me a lot of time and money.
B0049DUJ4G|1|This cap started leaking oil in less than 700 miles.  When I installed it I pre-lubricated the supplied 'O' rings and torqued the cap to the specified 22 ft-lbs.  After I removed the cap to check for the source of the oil leak the 'O' ring had flattened out and was permanently distorted.  I've never seen this before. I threw this junk away and replaced it with a genuine Mazda OEM part.
B0016IDV9M|5|Hot air was coming out of driver's side and I replaced actuator.  COLD AIR coming out now.  Awesome!
B00VNBDWPK|5|Love it.
B00469J9J4|5|Will definitely purchase again.
B007MNU684|5|Fast shipping. And clear instructions!!
B00TR7XT9Q|3|too pricey
B00068WT8C|5|It worked very well for my project. I would recommend it for gluing things to glass.
B006G2MJZU|5|good
B005G82C8E|4|Other than the small area in between the shades, no way to design this to cover that, this product works great.  I live in Arizona and keeping the sun out of vehicle as much as humanly possible is a MUST!  These shades were not only reasonably priced, they went in easy and the adhesive has held up to 119 degrees!  Great buy and very happy with product!  Only reason I did not give 5 stars is because they do sit in the lower portion of the windshield.  Do they block your view of road or surroundings....NO.  Are they there....yes.  They will by no means block or obstruct your view but you do notice them occasionally.  Is that a reason to not buy them, no.  Was impressed with design and heft of shades, they are not cheap plastic!  Well worth money!!!!
B00KWQRC4O|4|it's a little smaller than I thought it would be but overall, it does the job!
B00QYBVPXU|4|These look awesome. Just know these are not plug and play on the North American Chevy Cruze.
B00HNKYD0I|2|Glue runs out and in sun these strips keep sliding off. Would not order these again.
B00IX5MOD0|5|These are fantastic!  Bought them for my MINI.  Easy to install, mostly metal (feel high quality) evenly bright and really add look wonderful. You can get all kinds of other inserts too, for a great price.  Info comes in the box.
B00435TVD0|5|I think they nailed the &#34;stripper smell&#34;!  Smells great!
B007OW6JEI|5|Fit well in Corolla 2015.
B001C4SLC2|5|Perfect fit fast shipping
B009FU4R5U|4|I'm going to give this a mixed review. I have always preferred Bilstein shocks for my vehicles and have never been disappointed. I wasn't this time either, but I just simply ordered the wrong part for my vehicle. I have a 2003 VW Jetta that these were going to replace the original factory rear shocks. The removal and installation was straightforward. The shocks did what they were designed to do. However, being an HD shock, they made my ride harsher than I realized they would. I've had Bilstein HD shocks on my trucks and SUVs before and they work great in those applications. These on a sedan are great for cornering and quick maneuvering. However, on a daily driver, the ride needs to be a bit more forgiving. I returned these in exchange for the &#34;Sport&#34; version and am happy with the product.
B00BEJ9HQO|2|Included all necessary parts, but the rebuild did not hold up.
B003SOKEXI|4|I have not used this product yet since my truck never came with power mirrors but I'm in the process of converting over right now. The switch looks and feels pretty close to a factory switch, not 100%, but really good. I would buy again.
B007ZS9WPY|5|wasy swap
B0093B0IA4|5|Lightweight, easy to handle, and effectively reflective.
B00CHQV7CU|2|SMALL for the price
B00A2WENUE|5|Item received as described, thanks.
B000AMXQDG|5|yes great stuff !!
B003V57NUQ|5|Very efficient. Now it is very easy to transport my  kayaks , and I am getting more use of my kayaks because of these racks.
B00WJTEE1G|4|After having several different tire deflators over the years these are by far the best for.the money
B001TQ1XAA|5|very comfortable
B007AC03OY|1|This item sucked it did not work I had to buy from Volkswagen because my car got disprogram
B0044AVLF0|5|These are the same filters used at the dealer. Love the low price and I usually buy them in a set of 4 to qualify for free shipping.
B005HAT9SM|5|great product
B0002MSY90|4|Not a lot to go wrong with abrasives
B00FYO8UL8|1|Does not detect as described. I went as far as to slightly open a freon bottle of 410A to the point you could actually hear it leaking and this detector did not alert.
B009OJ42TI|1|NO STARS.  DONT BUY THIS. Sorry but I have to say this.  I used it once, and after the time to install and finally use it, it worked just fine.  Then the next time I used it, it would not pull back in. Totally locked up.  I got no refund nor did the manufacture warranty it.  I am out all this money, and still have no winch.  This is the second KFI winch me and my husband had purchased, and now in total we are out 700.00 dollars, and still have no winches for either my bike nor our side by side.  We bought the KFI winch 4500 for it, and it too is now a boat anchor.  What a joke.  IF the manufacture wont warranty anything, then what are we paying for.<br /><br />We are so afraid to buy any more winches.  Thinking of going with a jeep winch with an IP68 rating.  Still don't have the money to shell out again, or take another chance.
B000GTU2HG|2|Kind of junky.
B00CQ44I42|5|Awesome hitch for my 2014 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport.  Looks perfect and very easy to install.  Like all other postings, just lower the spare tire a little bit (not all the way down) and install.  Used it to tow my 6X10 utility trailer and pulls it like a charm.  I used to be a Reese fan, but not Curt is my favorite.  Instructions were awesome and in color.  Others are cheap copies thrown in there.  Curt took there time in this product and made it easy for the installer.
B002ZTNV5K|5|Easy to install, nice quality!
B000CGGMTK|5|Great! Thanks!
B0043ZWPZG|5|These Klim Traverse pants are great!<br />I wore them on a 2 week 5,800 mile trip with no problems.<br />Kept me set in the rain and the vents kept me relatively cool in the 90+ temps in Idaho.
B000L3PYZC|5|Got rid of the cigarette smoke in the house and cars. I recommend this product to everyone I know!
B002UC4Y6C|5|This product was exactly as described. It works perfectly. I have a 2011 Chevy Silverado. Mine is the WT package, so it has the trailer harness already there, but didn't come with the receptacle. This piece twisted in and hooked up perfectly. The only minor fault I have with it (and it really doesn't bother me) is that its not as big as the gm one, so you can see the slot where it twists in (hard to explain) but like I said, no big deal here... still fits good and actually looks nice (better than the blank useless plate that was there). Not too much else to say about this piece, but it does what its supposed to, and looks nice, feels of good quality!
B000JZB4OM|4|Worked great for a 97 Pathfinder.  Was exactly what you'd expect to find in the local auto parts store.  Have had them on the truck for approximately 20k miles and haven't had any problems.  Only reason for one star less than perfect is that of the pair I purchased (they're sold individually) one of the arm bushings was rotated and had to be forced into place.  Never got it perfect but it hasn't affected the vehicle so I'll live with it!
B004A0ZLSC|5|Quality, heavy mat.  Fits and works great.
B0052FRXXA|5|I needed to replace the driver's door handle on my 2001 Camry LE and this worked perfectly. Looks like new again!
B007KPU7L0|5|Perfect fit for the perfect price.
B00K31M554|5|Works great in my MINI Cooper and my Mitsu Montero!
B002YIXZEY|5|Awesome product...the rubber middle is perfect.
B00CJOKZ1O|3|Fitment was better than those generic seat covers out there, but not nearly as good as the OEM honda covers.  If you're looking to spend this much, save yourself the headache and get the OEM set instead for just a few more $.
B003ZE05KS|5|Great product!
B001AIZ5HY|5|The best headlight restoration system I've used.  As long as you follow the directions, you should get the desired results.
B00NQCLCCO|3|It has a low frequency whitch makes it a little annoying for the eyes
B00CB8WM2S|5|Nobody wants to get into an accident but sometimes things happens and it is better to be prepared, in that way at least we can prevent things to get worse or avoid more injury or casualties. That's why i got this car hammer and seatbelt cutter coz you'll never know when you'll gonna be using one in cases of emergencies. I've seen in the news people get stuck in the car with their seatbelt after an accident and didn't get out in time. Coz some nearby rescuer couldn't get them out. With this simple escape tool, i feel safe and secure knowing that if somebody needs my help or for myself and my family, we can immediately do something about it. Like if a child or a pet was left by irresponsible parents inside the car in scorching heat, this car hammer can come in handy to smash the windows to take out the child/pet. Or if there was a road accident, and somebody is stuck in their seat belt, you can just cut the seatbelt easily with this cutter.<br /><br />The hammer is made from durable steel and a very sharp blade on the other end. It comes with a holder so you can just stick it on the side of your car and  easily remove it when needed and can easily be put back when not in use. The orange color is a great factor too so it can be easily seen during emergencies. This is really a must have tool for every car owners. I got this complimentary product for testing and review purposes. All thoughts and opinions are of my own and were not swayed by anyone.
B007RKMV12|5|Awesome
B001CEG90I|5|Easy to install and way cheaper than the $50 the Toyota dealership would have charged.

B00E6A7MAG|5|Sticker arrived on time and is great!
B00NLMD574|1|cover was to small did not fit entire car. i thought it was suppose to be universal fit at least, but was not.
B00F0M3QJK|4|These are nice, You directions suxed bad they where blurry and not clear of what I needed. Also missing nuts and washers. Was not very happy about that part.
B000CSD39A|5|2002 dodge ram 2500 cummins, fit perfectly in stock location. Wasnt a Wix filter like i ordered, it said delco, or delphi i cant remember. Over all its a great BHAF!
B00NGHM1NI|1|So bad quality 👎🏼
B00EDFM6R8|5|Perfect for my needs. Nice color too.
B00BLTOTKQ|5|No complaints, quality parts, fast delivery, and price is right on! Tnx.
B00D8UFQFI|1|The spelling of Honda was misspelled and the adhesive came off as soon as I placed it on the clean tank.
B000VB2U88|5|Perfect!! Works great. Exact fit.
B004MNKS4Y|5|great match
B000N9VHMS|5|Works great
B00N77WSDA|5|Easy install they look great.. Warning though they change colors when the sun bakes them I ordered black and their like this bronze orange color now. It's a really different color still like it though
B006NYIUBI|5|Used on my 74 Thing. Had to trim a little off but works fine
B008CH9JAA|1|completely disappointed with scooter mirror purchase. mirrors arrived with missing parts (i.e. 10.25-8.25mm adapters. Had to make adapter(s) as I needed to make scooter legal
B00AJTPLH4|1|Gas cap thread is different than gas tank opening. Does not fit

B007KCY3EU|4|Seems OK. Slightly different than the original.
B000QFORK8|5|Lexol is the best there is period.
B000C32ISC|5|Fits perfectly and Goodyear makes great quality belts, which I've used before.
B00B0ALVLQ|5|Installed on a Yamaha 50cc motorcycle and seemed to be fine.
B003R8L4W0|5|Very good
B00FZZI35Y|2|After trying it on two or three times for fit (which seemed about right) the seams on the adjustable side straps began to come out.  I won't trust my well-being to something that's got shoddy stitching right out of the box.  Deeply disappointed.  (returned it for refund and bought something else in person)
B00KHX6WMU|4|Good for the price, it works
B005DJFXY6|5|really nice and easy to use!
B000C9I8WQ|5|Great product and my EGR works. Always buy AC Delco products.
B004ZF4DCM|5|Plug and play very easy to install comes with all the hardware needed for this installation. 55w Ballast and 6k bulbs are super white love this setup. Haven't had a problem.
B009ZGAF0A|5|Was great and got very quickly
B00JMR2WIA|5|I had to go to YouTube to figure out how to mount it. No instructions given. But, once we figured out how to do it, it took less than an hour. Once we had it mounted it looks great.
B00HHGSNTA|5|Happy with them
B006DYL6I2|5|exelente
B0000AY4YT|5|The oxidation bottle works magic.

B000E65PUU|5|The item fit just as it should
B00CNVDDRQ|5|Exactly what I needed to fix my Scotts L17.542 lawn tractor. Fit and works just like the original.
B00B62MA2M|3|Have had weather tech mats before and these seemed a little thinner and maybe a little wide in the back mats. The over the hump mat is nicer than my older each side mat. Overall still a nice set of mats, but maybe not as much to them as before.
B000OR18BE|5|Works perfect. Love the rubber wheels.
B00C8CD6MM|4|Sturdy but a way bigger for my 9 year old.
B00N0IHMXM|5|Good product, good quality.
B00MELB0XO|5|Great product, used it for years highly recommend.
B0012DRW2I|5|This shield is awesome.  A little pricey but worth the $$
B001UEHMCO|5|Worked perfectly for my 2004 Camry.
B00ODW2DXI|5|Great LEDs.  Looks so much nicer than the factor bulbs
B00029JXNE|4|It's a Tach....... Whats to say. Easy to install and wire up. Works well.
B0086I9R0M|4|was right on time and better quality than i thought. nice packaging and is perfect for my 98' Durango. very much worth the money. i gave i 4 stars because, its a little different than in the photo. instead of the dodge logo and &#34;DURANGO&#34; it just reads &#34;DODGE DURANGO&#34; which is no big deal but, i think it looks better in the photo, that's all. other than that its really good quality and in my opinion IS worth your money.
B00ECIPU3S|5|This was bought for my son's jeep, got it installed and it really lights everything up. The only issue is that you have wind noise that changes as you speed up or slow down. But we knew that was going to happen before we purchased it.
B005KDO9KE|5|Beyond perfect, they are amazing bulbs
B00T36HLYU|5|Perfect fit
B001KOI61K|5|Well made and worked perfectly.

B007U932EK|1|Great purchase,
B00295T4JW|5|works like a patina but better
B00JDTUCTS|5|Perfect if your furry child is adopted!
B000OKT6DS|4|Ready to go right out of the box as advertised.  Easy to install.  Easy to read and follow the instructions.  Nice looking unit and the pictures are very accurate so you can rely on them to show you how it will look.  I used this to replace my outside shower in the exterior cabinet for outside washing.  My unit needed the diverter to face downward as pictured.  However if your diverter comes off the top, then this one could be turned upside down, however, I don't know if the diverter pressure release would work the same way.  Haven't been camping since installing the faucet or I would probably rate it at 5 stars.
B00652G4TS|5|this unit does what the expensive on do. works great for me.
B003UWQFKY|2|This wax performs relatively similar to other cheaper ones. I don't see the merit in spending a premium for this wax. I expected better.
B000ES6MYG|5|They work great couldn't ask for a better product . only thing I would like to ask is what is the watts per led so I know how much my 10 w driver can handle.
B00BEN38BA|5|shows a substantial lift, heavy duty 1/4 inch plate steel. Add some elbow grease and this is a product worth its dollar. Don't forget to have replacement leaf spring bushings.
B00KGIDCQU|5|perfect on '99 25hp .Fast shipping
B0036E9VB6|5|Great product

B00QU6Y6BW|5|Looks great and you all are a great help
B003XGYDE2|5|LOVE it
B002MB57UI|5|Good stuff that I really believe in.  Didn't really have a problem, but believed in it enough to use it anyway.  Expect the tranny to last a whole lot longer.  Used it before and it eliminated the problem I had quickly.
B0006IX85K|5|Can't go wrong with this basic drinking hose connection.<br />I keep a couple around to make sure I can always get the correct hook up... maybe I should have bought a longer length?<br />Well made. Seems sturdy. And it works perfectly.
B011VNB75Q|5|Dad LOVES it! Helps him get out of the car very well.
B000BZI4JS|5|Received the part quickly and installed them the next day,<br />I don't think my truck ever ran so smoothly.
B007X6OEYW|5|Well made and does a great job.  Snaps plus Velcro makes for easy on and off of wash head.  Heavy aluminium handle extends for any job.  I would recommend this for big jobs.
B001OBH63I|5|Perfect
B003CK0PEG|5|Great order and product
B00NM4H572|3|I truly loved this set it was absolutely perfect for my boyfriend and I. I wore it a couple weeks before the chain broke whike taking it off. Love the idea of the set it is unique and adorable but definitely not very sturdy.
B0028JBEBK|5|It covers the whole windshield it's great but a little hard to rap back up in car
B00IM39A6M|5|Good value, great performance,  another satisfied customer.
B000BQWLE6|1|this bag will never fit a couple of empty soda cans m.
B001S7ZT5A|4|As advertised.
B00K889FCI|5|Follow the directions and it works like a charm.
B000JFJLK6|5|Top quality performance well made<br />Works great with my  gauges from 1980 good Old freon R 12  R 22 manifold<br />Must have supplied adopter to couple to freon can valve assembly purchased separately
B00WKXP7MG|5|great item for my vehecle
B002SVHD0O|5|Perfect!!
B006P88TJ0|5|As advertised, trusted seller AAAAA,
B000CGFOAI|4|The top bolt which on similar ones for imports is a 12mm head, is a 13mm / 1/2&#34; one.<br />Don't know if this makes a difference to you, but it does to me. I'd rather have it match the old one.
B0012RI5MK|5|Easy to install and works as it should. Unplug existing connectors and plug in these wire connectors and you're done.
B000WK45IG|5|These are really &#34;seal savers&#34; everyone should use these!
B00TUK306C|1|Cheaply made. Poor customer support.
B009PHD7P4|5|Yippee they work !
B00SLYZ2DM|5|Perfect!
B00BJ4BLMC|5|Direct factory replacement, installed on my 2015 Ford F250
B00BVB5SYU|5|Item arrived quickly and as described.
B008VJZ7SM|5|Was exactly what listed perfect fit easy install!
B004A30FHG|5|Thanks again I buy all my wheel bearings on amazon now and haven't had one problem
B00F2NHVX4|5|At first I wasn't to convince about the bucket insert (with helping keeping the dirt on the lower part of the bucket) and the 2 bucket cleaning method, so I just bought one.  Just with the first car wash I realize how effective is this device, so I bought a second one.  It does very well what is suppose to do.
B000HS1356|3|I have had this cover for 4 months and already have multiple rips in the material. It has been a rainy season in the Midwest, causing the material to rip due to semi-strong winds and melted due to warm weather and the heat from the exhaust.<br /><br />The cover fits great on my Ducati gt1000, even with the saddle bags on. I really want to like this product but can't get over the quality of the material used.
B00QMWQSAG|3|good quality but don't fix well to small
B005NLQAHS|5|No issues whatsoever getting the tool connected and using the app. This is a great diagnostic tool.
B0055DRD16|5|Extremely affordable alternative to all the high cost price protected brands: aka k***k*n...<br />Don't have to remove and tear apart the throttle assembly either ...<br />Just remove your old grips...I used contact cleaner, lifted the old grips up with a screwdriver and stuck the little red tube in there and went all around.<br />Old grips slid off undamaged on BOTH sides...<br />Used hairspray as adhesive on the throttle side and some e6000 on the clutch side cause it wasn't sticking too well...<br />Let it sit overnight and rode the next day with my shiny new and much more comfortable grips !!!
B000O5NQOS|5|Perfect
B00APOFQYQ|5|Excellent product
B00VU970D0|4|I have not installed it but it looks to be perfect. Was delivered on time. All is well.
B00J0ABS5M|5|Perfect item.
B001NFV3V6|1|Would not stick to helmet! Very disappointed
B004O844EM|1|It will NOT fit on factory Honda element roof rack. There is no way it will fit unless the vehicle roof rack was adjustable or your rack happened to fit perfectly in the small 'window' provided by the rack. I was also disappointed in how the extension attached to the basket; seemed flimsy and did not allow for the attachment brackets to be mounted underneath that specific area. I resold it for a slight loss and went on with my life.
B00DJ5KEF4|4|Works well.
B008ZDYLC2|5|Worked great; easy to understand manual.  Have used on Prius, Dodge Ram and Subaru Outback
B005MZUQFM|5|beautiful sign
B002XLBMZQ|2|I really wanted to like this, but after a few uses I'm starting to get play between the drop down and the ball bracket. Which make a nice thud when you brake or accelerate. I was contacted by the manufacturer about perhaps my warranty covering it, maybe I just got a bad one? I've only had it for less than 2 months and only tow a jet ski trailer.
B008DXXFXK|5|Good price and quality
B00TZ8HT5M|5|Perfect.
B00HTOB0NG|4|Good shipping time but noticed the back of on has a crack. Dont know if it was shipped this way or happened in delivery. Cosmetic damage those everything works fine
B00W8LRBWY|5|Greet
B00480BWA0|5|Fits just as described.
B010HFW35M|5|This was a great replacement for the stock torque strut mount in my 2008 Altima coupe. A word of warning: do not buy this thinking it will be an easy install because of the one video on youtube that exists out there. I have next to no experience doing auto work - all in, the job took me about an hour and a half. You're going to need the following tools: 11 mm wrench, 14 mm wrench/socket, 18 mm wrench, and a crow bar.  - Yes, a crow bar. The metal overhang that sits over the top bolt is WAY too close to it. After removing the two bolts (14 mm - the only easy part of the job) that hold it down, you can pry it up enough to get clearance to pull the top bolt (18 mm) on the mount out.  - The 18 mm wrench is for the bolts on the mount itself. You will likely need to 'extend' your wrench for extra leverage - these bolts are on VERY tight. When putting the top bolt to the mount back on, use the crow bar as a lever to keep the overhang up and start the screw before letting it go. This is one of the harder parts and will take you a while. The side bolt is relatively easy by comparison as long as you get the power steering fluid reservoir out of the way (see next point).  -The 11 mm wrench is used to unseat the power steering fluid reservoir from the chassis before trying to go after the side bolt (18 mm) on the mount. It's pretty easy to get these bolts off. It's much harder to get the right two back on. Make sure the bottom right hand one is seated pretty firmly in the hole and then press the fixture against the chassis while gently turning the wrench to tighten the bolt. Take your time. If you go too fast, it will fall out and you're likely to hurt your head banging it against the wall.  As far as actually replacing the mount goes, the orientation doesn't matter; both sides are the same. Just stick it in there and start with the side bolt (don't tighten it too much until you get the top bolt in) and then start the top bolt with that metal overhang propped up.  One final word of advice, if you can, cover the area you're working in. I dumped a wrench in the engine and it didn't hit the floor. The last thing you will want to deal with after doing this is a wrench that got stuck in the engine. Don't be dumb like me and learn from my mistakes. Most of all, take your time.
B00BF23HVQ|5|Good product
B00BG423YA|5|Good quality and fit amazing! using it as a keychain for now
B001GRQUO6|3|This is a nice product, but don't expect a perfect 100% fit as the company claims.<br />I have noticeable gaps where the mat fits my Acura along the gas release lever on the driver-side floor.  this is odd considering the company goes out of its way to explain on their site about the proprietary cutting matching process to make these an absolute perfect fit for my exact car model<br />Also the rear mat has curled along the edge for no reason. I contacted customer service through their website and got a fairly rude one sentence reply that I need to contact the actual seller since I didn't purchase direct from them. Wow.<br /><br />Still, the product is tough and looks great and considering the alternatives, you're probably not left with other options. But for the high price and the way the product is marketed it should be a near perfect, flaw-free fit which it is not. Close, but not perfect.<br />And their customer service reps could use some training.
B00X5EO6VC|5|Works great
B00B45GKUO|5|just as described.
B000BQYH6Q|5|cheap but they work fine :)
B00CCYWFPA|3|inside of screw heads are not painted!
B00V5E67KC|1|Junk, O ring is too small. Do not wast your money!
B004ZF39T0|5|Works great
B0002JMPRK|5|Good price and quality
B0052UO4LE|5|Excellent service and very easy to follow instructions on how to program new device.
B00HUGO45O|4|cool
B000E0UXFI|5|fit perfectly, AC was ice cold immediately with the evaporator replacement great product, 4 seasons has been around a long time and has been very reliable in my experience...  I didn't have any problem with the hose being too big like other eviewwers , fit like a glove
B003M6HCL4|5|My husband thought these were really cool. great little inexpensive decorative gift  for the guy who has just about everything!
B00WDZYFL0|4|Quickly shipped and looks just like the picture in the description. Just wish it had the Nissan emblem for the back
B000C5FL84|2|Wrong cap! Don't fit an I can't exchange it cause I waited too late!! $17 down the drain!!
B00BITJZ6M|4|Easy install.  Backing plastic piece did not fit right.  Just ended up using the old one.
B00AR5P01W|5|exactly what I expected
B00LNOK4E4|1|Units fell caught fire and fell apart upon installation.
B0049MM468|3|i had good success using it the first time to recharge wife's expedition last summer, but just tried to use the reusable fill valve/gauge and found the needle used to pierce the can was loose from fitting and would not penetrate the can for a second time use. So although it is intended to be used again, it's poor quality and failed to work a second time.
B00CBR5OY2|5|It's the exact right part,and it showed up in great condition!
B006G6VDQC|5|These are definitely the best for visibility. These combined with 55watt ballasts in a proper DOT approved projector gives the proper angle and adds the visibility range by a large magnitude.
B002X7VH1Y|3|Expected this product to do a better job. It does not seem to last on the surface of my granite counter top and the shine/finish is just &#34;OK&#34;. Probably will not buy it again.
B005PWU882|5|Item received as described, thanks.
B00UEC87QS|4|Not bad at all.  I recommend you open your grille before installing.  Easy to ensure it's line up correctly.
B00C3MUKSU|5|Best tool bag I've ever had !!!<br />Highly recommended !!!<br /><br />I have the sissy bar bag that matches and couldn't be happier with them both !!!
B009XAR2CM|4|Good little gauge. It not super sturdy, but made well enough it could be dropped. The nozzle end has to be placed perfectly straight onto the valve of the tire to get a reading. If it is at any angle the it lets out a ton of air. This is a mixed blessing as the little air release button barely lets out any air, so -- if you're over inflated, you can tilt the connection and lower the tire pressure rather quickly. It's not a complete inconvenience to need to be mindful of how you are connecting the gauge, but im used to gauges like this being a little more snug and sealing more quickly when connected to the tire valve.<br /><br />If the above sounds ok to you, buy it. It's an ok little gauge to keep in the car etc.
B00GZLMEPM|5|Great Kit
B0006H8BE4|5|Worked great beyond expectations same as o.e. I would highly recommend to anyone looking and very very responsible price .
B00RZV7FGE|5|I had the car seat cover about a week. Very impressed with how well it holds onto the seat and doesn't slip. Comfortable and seems to feel cooler than my actual car seats. Very happy with the product!
B000JZGN3E|4|Worked great for a 97 Pathfinder.  Was exactly what you'd expect to find in the local auto parts store.  Have had them on the truck for approximately 20k miles and haven't had any problems.  Only reason for one star less than perfect is that of the pair I purchased (they're sold individually) one of the arm bushings was rotated and had to be forced into place.  Never got it perfect but it hasn't affected the vehicle so I'll live with it!
B001EP2904|5|Ordered and installed hitch cover to protect against rust and improve appearance.  Installed with snug fit and looks good.  Happy with purchase.
B001GRMLA8|5|It's Weather Tech.
B00N9CT56G|5|Excellent Product , Service and Price .
B000VB6Y44|5|It's WeatherTech.
B003UM9GDM|3|jack is good casters are weak with a heavy bike on it you can't roll it but it is jacked up safely so you can clean and work on it I'm looking for different casters
B00JTM9A5Q|5|Really good quality overall. Well worth the money. I use these on RC Trucks and Tanks.
B00G6KGPFM|5|Super, looks like a pro did the work.
B000CIU8O8|5|Nice thank you
B0066COHEG|2|Fan blades make too much noise.
B00FS77ISW|5|I used these during a long trip for bow and stern lines for two kayaks on j-style carriers and they performed great.  I recommend them.
B000EDSSMA|5|Worked in the camper perfectly.
B009Y7MJVS|4|Seems to work OK-has not fallen off windshield yet
B00T0WWKFW|1|cheap material, does not fit windows, a little bit too large
B0052SF0LO|3|Works well.
B00KSD47IU|5|Great product, great seller, great price.
B009IUMCA4|3|rusts....
B00KIEASPK|3|not sure if its legal to have in my state.
B003Z9T33I|5|I'm very happy with tonno pro I like that it can be taken off in less than 2 mins and reinstalled in about 3 very well built
B00LC82GZQ|5|Looks exactly like the OEM product. The instructions for programming it didn't match my vehicle, however I found the instructions easy enough and it was very easy to do. Works perfectly.
B0079QRRRM|2|It looks great from the outside. The interior is relatively small, a very tight fit for anything you need to carry. The waist belt attaches on the side - very difficult to snap in. Don't be convinced this backpack is great because of how it looks - I sold mine after using it twice.
B006AAJ31Q|5|Perfect for our '54 Belaire Chevy with wide white wall tires!  Easy to install, looks retro, and helps keep curb scuffs off the tires.
B011P4DQBY|4|Works well. I used on a black truck after a good wash. Time will tell if it lasts as long as a true hand wax. I received a discount to review this item
B00J7YZRX0|5|This is an outstanding alternative to MB parts.<br />Good fit and quality.<br />Very pleased.
B00HNJF86C|3|Kind of a pain to use; Cam gear alignment must be *perfect* and there's no indicator of which end is the top, so you have to play around with it a little to get the thing on your cam gears. The plastic tools offered by other companies are probably a little better in that regard, but after messing with this for a little bit I am able to get my cam gears lined up. Marked the top for future use on mine.
B003TQ86QM|5|2002 Dodge Ram 2500 cummins, fit perfectly over BHAF!
B00VNQNQBK|1|They don't work they only blow fuses they are very poor quality!
B004I15GB0|5|great deal. thanks!
B000CSIS54|5|Top notch !  Works great!
B00LUYAPY6|1|Part did not fit as guaranteed
B005XZQHA4|5|Very solid lock strap.
B00F7S74FY|4|Highly disappointed! Cheap product Bmw wasn't even centered correctly and oversized for plates...I returned product and never got credit for it! Wouldn't purchase from this outfit again!!!!
B004I0LV6U|1|Item did not fit my vehicle even thought it said it was a match. Double check you part before you order.
B00UX8D7YK|5|I was pleasantly surprised thinking that for the price they wouldn't be that impressive. Well, they are very well made and extremely bright. I mounted these to the pipework that supports the hardtop on my Boston Whaler Conquest 235 so that I would have some chance of seeing the marker buoys late at night ... The results were outstanding...  I ran across a shallow bay on a moonless night last weekend at close to 30 MPH with total confidence. I have a nice chart plotter and radar but the visual confirmation is the last bit of comfort I need.
B004GCZ4FY|5|:)
B008TT0DG0|5|Exact fit.
B00QRANHI4|1|Piece of crap broke within the first few days and didn't work at all. Would not buy another one if my life depended on it.
B00IWO4K8O|4|Love them
B00BKRFZRA|2|I like the gloves but with in two weeks they started falling apart
B003BSB7PU|5|works great!
B003WOZOUM|4|Sturdy materials and build quality. Used it on one trip so far and it worked great.<br /><br />Only con: the gap that the straps make in the door seal lets in some road noise and a little water if it rains. Totally acceptable though.
B00Q5MGTYS|5|Installed but haven't used yet. Looks as though they will be very good.
B00T8HPH36|5|Awesome product thanks!
B00E1R797K|5|Great product. Easy to install. Looks great on the bike.
B00F0CIO60|3|Another ground strap?
B00FQ0ROZS|5|these lights are heavy duty ,made great and inexpensive the only that hurts my feelings is they have come down since I bought mine
B00MQ9XPJQ|4|Great quality. Would buy again
B00094I1SA|5|As long as they make these, I'll keep buying them.
B00T3TQLKW|3|Works quite well, Moves a good amount of air, but you can tell they're on the cheap side.
B003TPXDD4|5|I used it on my MOPAR small block. The color looks great and applied very smoothly and evenly. It matched well when doing a few touch ups.
B00LX0C98M|5|Works great as soon as I connected them immediate transfer of power. Must hav I. Your car
B000H7CKAY|5|Good Stuff!
B00TUJGUA6|5|Great product !
B00FHHUK24|5|Nice, Received the product in 3 days 👍
B00U2ADLW2|5|This tool works well and just as advertised. Yes, the functions are limited, but that's why it's only $20! If you're thinking of buying this to help diagnose a check engine light I recommend doing it.
B00JCHE4N6|2|The bracket is solid enough, but it doesn't come with mounting bolts.
B0038HWZ5K|4|So far so good. Fit well and started right up. Seems to have more juice then the normal acid type.
B00YLZ7C3S|5|Disappointment
B00ZMLI2KM|5|Awesome product, quick shipment
B0051TPJKG|5|perfect
B00QSLOSBC|5|was the correct cover finally
B00J73BKIM|5|Very fine product........if you buy the unit for your year and model and you have factory tow package it's plug and play! about a 15 minute install...........Thalnks!
B008J6TO6I|2|The hem on the whole too edge was sewn but not to the actual sun shield.
B001DMDS9E|5|This has made hooking up my toad so much easier. I use it with the BX 1134 base plate for my Wrangler. Now I'm connected or disconnected from the RV in moments instead of minutes. One person operation is easy, just pull up close to the RV and the moveable bars will line right up and hook on. I love it.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Awesome!!!
B004JKX4X2|5|Exceeded expectations.  This bag was purchased for a 1400 mile round trip and held up better than expected.  It rained, heavily at times, and there was not a drop inside the bag or on the contents.  The quality of construction of the bag is very good.  The straps are perfect and did the job of securing the bag to the cargo rack without any additional straps.  For space reference, here is a list of what I was able to fit in the bag with plenty of room to zipper the bag shut easily:<br />- (2) medium size plastic totes filled with things like dry foods, laundry/bathroom stuff<br />- (2) large sized duffles (clothes) that sat on top of the plastic totes<br />- Bike helmets<br />- (2) Razor scooters folded<br />- tons of loose pairs of shoes stashed in available small spaces left in bag<br />- about a dozen beach sized towels<br />- a few canvas grocery bags about half filled with odds and ends<br /><br />* Note product states 11 cu ft of storage (9 cu ft if lower zipper is zipped)<br /><br />I would recommend this product.
B00F68HINI|5|Perfect fit, fast shipping and good price. Install was very easy too.
B001A0IT5C|5|It was perfect for my old Car. Just what I needed
B000GU7JSK|1|Was supposed to fit my bike and doesn't
B001UEJJUC|5|Shipping was on time, filter works perfect.
B000OCHCIW|5|Great jack could have found cheaper but liked the product.
B0068C2IIQ|5|EXCELENTE
B003CJAWVI|1|Is not match to r6 2014
B0095WPO5A|3|Good product
B000B8GAKA|5|Driving around in our car, we kept smelling fuel and started thinking something was seriously wrong. Finally, on a Sunday, my husband popped the hood and discovered our oil cap was missing (probably had been since our last oil change at Sears in Key West, as that is when the smell started). I ordered this little bugger and it arrived on Monday. Perfect fit. No more smell. Now looking for somewhere else on this tiny island for my oil changes.
B0072RWHMS|5|Amazing floor mats wish I knew about them sooner.
B00GTXSB9Y|2|Nice color. Doesn't fit very well. The red trim ring doesn't come together, see accompanying picture. Maybe this is why it's a poor fit.
B00NGPJVPG|5|perfect and shipped quickly with an extra battery
B000H6QWWC|5|Met my expectations. Was recommended and I am totally satisfied.
B00AVMXWRU|1|I got these Mud Flaps today but the mounting screws seem short only have 8, also only have 1 metal clip. And the instruction are in  German for a BMW. Does anyone with these have any word on the number of screws and clips needed
B0089EHY26|3|It's ok. Doesn't hold my phone from sliding like I hoped but it's ok if not in sharp turns
B00MQ1J6S8|5|mirror didn't fit
B00C0SQC52|5|Nothing too special, they're just tags.  But they seem pretty heavy duty and have pretty strong key chain ring.<br />I'm using this for my Phantom 3 to remind me to remove the gimbal guard and it works, but is kind of akward.
B0050SFVO2|5|Until I got this tester I was at a loss to find the skip my engine had. Works perfectly. Thank you
B0058VT4N0|5|love it
B007ZD6G1C|5|This is my second vehicle with Weathertech liners.  Living in the northern climate and being an avid outdoorsman, there simply is nothing better to use in your vehicle.  What do you clean these wonderful mats with?  Simple, Weathertech's Tech Care.  I've used other products that I already own but nothing works better than this.  This cleans the product and makes it look just as it came from the factory.  It's doesn't leave your mats slippery.  It is more expensive, but worthwhile as you get 2 bottles.  A little goes a long way.  Highly recommended.
B007TYG7TI|5|Looks and fits perfectly! Thank you!
B00J8D5PCS|5|Installed in my 2014 crew cab and hard to tell from stock seats! Good deal
B000EQR7XS|5|good product
B004I9BQ6G|1|Not sure whether this is a StopTech or Amazon issue, but I ordered these pads for a '93 Nissan 240SX (non-ABS) and I made sure to double-check to ensure that these would fit. Worked on my brakes today and comparing the old pads to these I noticed they were significantly shorter, lo and behold I try to pop them in and there's a huge gap between the shims. I'm not sure whether Amazon shipped me the wrong product or StopTech manufactured pads to a non-OEM spec but either way I'm pretty disappointed.
B005VKLGUW|5|Great product
B00KSY3HFS|5|So easy to use, flip away, and works excellent. Noticeably cooler, especially on 95-110 days here in Yakima desert.
B00LL6PK2K|5|It works very well. I took it to work to compare the psi reading against one of our standard (very precise) pressure gauges and it was very accurate. It's a good buy.
B00RW7WGME|5|Item was shipped fast and was a perfect fit. No streaking or smearing. I will be buying more for my other vehicles.
B00WAORFI4|5|I love this product.  It allows me to leave my car windows cracked for the heat but if it rains, it does not get in my car.
B000CPHX12|5|Perfect for my Chevy
B00DOGBA7O|1|I'm not sure which bike this starter solenoid fits, but its not the right one for my 2006 Victory Jackpot. it doesn't even match the one in the picture.
B009AQMLMA|3|Ok product, would rather have a bolt on one!!
B00PYN45R2|5|works with everything that i own if the things don't start
B0090DXBEK|5|easy to program was able to program in 2 mins then i took to homedepot to it cut for free<br /><br />make sure to program before you cut it to make sure it works.
B007AUV85Y|2|It would look best on the paint of a white vehicle.
B004I0M5O2|5|Was able to install it in about 15 minutes..
B0017HB41E|4|The mounting points on the tank where not the best, had to make adjustments to these to mount in my truck. They could have been positioned better. The rear mounting pads where difficult because one was higher than the other, had to make another bracket as to mount to back wall of bed.
B009A9M2BW|1|please i want to buy the flower carpet does not have the option to choose the colors and the size of my truck and the international prostar 2011
B007JYYPO2|3|one cap screw that goes through the frame and holds a wheel on was missing, other then that, it's plenty rugged for my needs.
B006LGKI1I|5|Holds well adjusts nicely
B001GJ3FIS|5|Works very well and a good price.
B003IOKPLO|5|I've used this a couple of times the last year - no issues.  I bought Actron to replace an older unit purchased in 2002.  The old unit is still problem free and the new one works with all the current models.
B005CO9GX6|1|IT CAME DAMAGED AS I TOLD YOU BEFORE AND SENT PICTURES.  IF YOU WANT MORE PICS I WILL HAVE TO RETAKE SOME.
B000Q86IQQ|2|Does not hold cups very securely. Have to wrap rubber bands around cups and holder to keep cup in holder even during the lightest jarring. . I have another brand cup holder where the jaws actually slide apart along a saw tooth rail. Holds cups very well. Thought this was same but alas, it is not. I will look for the saw tooth rail on my next order.
B004VJ39AO|4|This is the 4th cruise control we have had installed on Scion 2006 cars. It's great having cruise control but they don't work as well as ones that come factory installed on cars. They tend to accelerate going up hills to increase the cars speed 3 to 5  mph. It's something you get used to.
B00AM24Y94|5|A must for the Northwest.
B001FZL9ZO|5|Quick delivery.<br /> Good looking, well made, functional and very sturdy product.<br /> Love the LED brake light option.
B00O1I3IME|1|No instructions, paperwork to return,  and bolts were plastic and stripped out as soon as I started to install the nuts.
B00KJBF32K|5|worked great
B005BNYY26|5|Great product easy to use, works as designed.
B009O4DAXM|2|These do fit but are made of very cheap compound and compress as soon as you put the vehicle weight onto the spacer.<br />This would be fine as a 1/2&#34; spacer.<br />I also wounder how long they will last?
B004I0L54S|5|You could not ask anymore from this product.  It matches right up to the Original equipment and works perfectly.  No issues with connection or light.  Highly recommend.
B001G7WQ7G|5|I was perfect
B00042K74I|2|This is generally a good design but poorly manufactured. The hinge is very tight and as soon as it is opened it strips all the paint off leaving mild steel exposed. This will quickly rust rendering the hinge inoperable, probably when you are stuck and need the jack most. Also the large bolt which has a hole drilled through it was so burred that the wing nut would not screw on. Finally the zinc plated bolts for fastening the bracket will not stand up. I will replace them with stainless which should have been included in the first place.
B00KTHYAUU|5|Worked flawlessly for the Toyota Highlander 2003. Highly recommended. Was a bit tricky to code and configure but works like a charm, and has good distance also.<br /> Note: ensure only the drivers door is unlocked before starting the process.
B00FRHOO9O|1|One of my wipers started falling apart similar to the others who have reviewed these poorly. This pretty much cements the idea that the product is something to stay away from. Perhaps it's back to oem for my Chevy Volt.
B009FU7RPC|5|Great
B0016KG77S|1|wrong item and broken as well
B00KJLM3YG|1|Both of broke in less than a year I won't order these again
B00KMNUL5E|1|Did not work
B000C33LK6|5|fit and worked on a 1998 lexus es300.
B00PBDCF0Y|5|Fits perfectly
B003A4KJ1S|5|Excelente
B00BI4U96W|5|Perfect
B00MYI521S|5|Fit the jeep very well...firm mount and easy to install...The 50&#34; light bar was anout an inch too long and a lot of &#34;elbow grease&#34; was required to get the light mounted. BUT, it ain't goin' nowhere now!
B00NHBYOA6|1|This thing barely cools anything. I bought it for my boat, and after 5-6 hours on, it barely gets above room temperature. Considering returning for a different brand
B006NFBRG2|5|A good value for L-track tie-down rings.
B004LWVEKS|4|AAA+++
B011C7BRC4|5|Seems to act like WD-40.  Good product.
B00XWQJXB6|5|I love everything about this motor period! Great improvement to my bike. I weigh 230 lbs and it gets me anywhere very fast. Thank you bicycle motor works.  I would appreciate a call back though. Please email me so I may get you on the phone for some possible future business.  jtcplus@gmail.com thanks joe carroll
B00Z7KIZPA|4|I was provided this item for free in exchange for my review. I was not paid or told what to write. I have an Impala and have a center armrest that is perfect for anchoring this pouch. While I have used it a few times for my purse, I also keep a 3-ring binder in it for my groceries. I have two small children and this is perfect for keeping their things in until we get home. I especially like it for holding a trash bag on trips. It's a bit unwieldy for me, but I can't reach back very far, so this may be why. I keep this in my car and find it very handy to keep things off the floor.
B004306VTC|5|everything I hoped for
B00HXILF5Q|5|We all know Mobil One was one of the first synthetic oils, and ---- this is what Mercedes recommends for the Sprinter. I've always put my trust in Mobil 1.
B000B6JJUK|3|It worked great, but then the battery died pretty quickly.
B00VKBIQ6S|1|Very cheap roof! Only 2 months on & has already cracked.  Only item we've gotten from this company that we weren't happy with.
B000H6QWWC|5|Quality Item! I would suggest to everyone to purchase. Item came when expected, and packaging was good.
B00D1CQVIY|5|excellent
B008KNI8YY|5|These are absolutely needed to install your heating system on a metal roof.  However, they were installed in August and I will have to wait until next spring to give a full evaluation!!!
B009XA8YK6|5|Perfect fit!
B000CPI5XC|5|Cheap insurance for my pump. Been using it for years with no issues.......... ever!
B00LL6PK2K|5|nice
B00429NKWK|4|This was the best-rated kit by Consumer Reports.  It says 3 steps, but it's really 10.  The hard part was knowing how hard to sand - it says use medium pressure with two of the sandpapers then firm with the last...but what does that really mean?  maybe there's some better way they could describe that.  My headlight does not look good as new, but it's a whole lot better.
B00M6I7D90|5|Very quick shipping.  Work right out of the box with Mercedes Benz GLK350.
B00KJWW7GO|5|This installed in less the 5 minutes with minimal skill required. Simply pop the existing insert out with a straight slot screwdriver and push the cupholder in until the clips catch. Done. Operates easily by simply pushing on the drink sign and the cup holders slide out. They are a little slow at first but will speed up as you use it. GREAT product for the price!
B0012INT98|5|Holds a ton of stuff and completely waterproof. Easy to secure on a roof rack. Great product for the money.
B006SA3T90|5|Perfect.
B007IPL0PY|5|Good price for an AGM battery in this size. Easy to fill and charge. Note that you should use a microprocessor-controlled charger (e.g. BatteryMinder) with any AGM battery.
B000BIUEB6|1|the chin strap just does not line up.
B00AWPGUSE|4|A little less heavy duty than I thought it'd be. But all in all I'm happy with the purchase. Nice to have straps that match your ski.
B00GHT6U3Y|5|awesome oem alternative
B008GBB1K8|4|I love the sticker, didn't fit exactly over top sun shade actual warning airbag garbage. Make it a custom sticker and fit it better to actual. Still get tons of laughs though.
B000HBM5TQ|4|I actually don't know why I bought this exact &#34;Surface Insensitive&#34; variation but it works just as well as the regular blue stuff so I'm satisfied.
B001HKZHIW|5|Works very well - bought this to work as solution to pump RV holding tanks 125 feet to the septic tank. This is able to pump the tanks effectively although if both black and gray tanks are full I have to give it a rest in between. It removes much more waste than a simple gravity drain will do.
B007OW6MD6|5|These fit perfectly and do not leak, crack or break, unlike the rubber or plastic ones.
B00LFL74HK|5|Perfect!
B005HZ4HBG|5|2015 GMC Acadia
B001EP0HGC|4|Works as advertised
B00GSAUHB8|4|Works well, the old one, not sure the name brand worked for about 8 years. I like this one a little more
B002801LEE|3|It didn't fit my car
B00KMUDVA4|1|Just got them.  First pair has several holes in them after 2 hours clearing brush.  Not high quality gloves.  Would not buy again.
B0006IX7Y2|5|these things are amazing :) a must for any RVer!
B004UARNHO|5|Seems to be good quality. Piece of mind
B0031HFZSQ|5|To all you overly sensitive people out there, learn to spell, drop the weight and first and foremost grow a pair, stop being so sensitive, it's a joke, learn to laugh. Do the truffle shuffle and get over yourself!
B004303LMC|5|Just what I was looking for, nice burnished edges with a black finished look.
B00Y5ENZ0E|1|Junk. Dont pick up any stations and it broke on me screwing it on. Suggest they find a new glue to better hold it together
B0097CDPBI|5|This was exactly what I was looking for. Even though it came with a dead battery, my original  key fob needed a new battery too and paid less than two dollars for two batteries and it was so worth it. Now I do not look like an idiot pushing a button standing in front of my car with nothing happening. Now I push a button and my car responds immediately. Love this
B0089UEOKA|5|these things rock i broke my stock ones in half after jumping my civic but these fit perfectly on my 1995 honda civic LX just bolted directly on no fitment issues at all they add a little horse power but is a honda don't kid yourself they started out silver then turned blue pretty cool
B006FUT05U|4|Pretty good. Sometimes it tends to leave swirls possibly from the recent hest wave. I try doing it late night but it's tough with no day light. Good stuff tho would buy again
B000C5HHMC|5|My 2001 ZX3 occasionally wouldn't start when hot. I eventually figured it wasn't refusing to start, just refusing to idle. The internet led to the idea  of cleaning this  part, but since it is such a pain to get to, I decided to replace it instead, on the theory that it would last the remaining life of the car, as the Focus  has 140,000 miles on it. So far, the car hasn't refused to start, and it does seem to be idling smoother.
B00CQUTQS4|3|The high beams went out after a year.
B00YE99WFW|4|This stuff is difficult to find, but can be used for a several purposes. I have it inside the door jambs on my work trucks and my Jeeps, that way when I open the door ( day or night ) people can see it right away. I also covered spots on the inside of my toolbox on my trucks so that when I have the lid open, you can see me as well. Great product for a great price.
B00II5YADC|2|it's too rigid and too long.
B001PRV7VI|5|great
B00SGF41N8|1|Would have been a good product if they didn't cheap out and only use one bolt as a clamp to the handlebar. The metal was so weak that it snapped the lower flange. This issue isn't covered by a warranty so off to figure out a different solution. Get a brake with a U style vs C.
B000C5I6H2|5|Best clips when you have the new style locks sets that refuse to stay locked in place these little clips work​ wonders.
B00M9IYSD6|1|I had the smoked double bar installed by my local Honda dealer and made sure to express my concern for waterproofing the wires because they looked fragile and I didn't want a short or for debris to interrupt the connection. The LEDs and tag light are bright but I was told the turn signals and brake were difficult to see on a bright day by friends following me. It looked great for about 3 months until I checked it one day after work which I do weekly and the bottom bar had a section of about 5 or 6 LEDs that were out and struggling to stay on. I let it try to fix itself for a week and it would work until I turned the bike on or randomly. I brought it to the same Honda dealer for a diagnosis to see if I could get it fixed and was told it had to be replaced. I decided to pay even more to have the stock setup put back on with LED bullet signals instead of stock. When I tried to get a return I was put through Chrome Glow/Sport Bike Lites instead of Amazon. I explained everything previously and that I didn't want a replacement and would even except a partial return of my $249.99 because I didn't want to have it happen again. I was told the LEDs were under warranty and I was past the return policy (but only had installed for a couple months by an authorized Honda dealer). So I had to pay to have it shipped and pay processing and return fees and all they did was replace the bar and send it back. I was told I was getting a new one and to sell it on ebay if I didn't want it but it's still my old one because it came back assembled and has dirt still on it. The whole process with Chrome Glow/Sport Bike Lites was very frustrating every phone call. I had problems with their system accepting the $8.99 charge for return fees on my card and was told the problem was with my bank, this card/account has been used very recently to make many purchases online and has sufficient funds. I was told the name and zipcode did not match and I have been at this address my whole life. I hope you like Kid Rock's &#34;All Summer Long&#34; because that song will start over each time you are put on hold because you will be put on hold &#34;All Summer Long&#34;. All in all just avoid the frustration and modify your stock setup or find a better brand. The bar didn't line up exactly with the line of the fender lip but it's not significant. The kit is just thin plastic and is held together with small zip-ties and screws, not nearly worth $249.99 for the double which I got to be more visible and safer. The stock is still brighter LEDs and less bulbs and much better quality, I suggest even smoking the red lens if you want a completely blacked out look, I left mine red.ike Kid Rock's &#34;All Summer Long&#34; because that song will start over each time you are put on hold because you will be put on hold &#34;All Summer Long&#34;.

B00NH8WRKS|5|High quality. Expedient Delivery.
B000BSY9J4|5|Work quite well.  Unit is somewhat oversize.  Smaller size would be a lot handier in tight quarters.
B00IXZQCAG|5|Perfect!
B00NI4X1HE|3|I realy like the pattern withe pink accent. My only complaint is that the velcro runs all the way down and I'm always getting the edge caught on my cloths. I'm afaid in the winter that if I'm not careful that my sweaters will end up with snags.
B005MJYTRE|2|I really found this product useful. While it didn't feel particularly tight or restrictive while working (handheld camera operator) my shoulder definitely felt less sore at the end of the day. I have a rotator cuff injury a couple of months back that I am still recovering from, this brace seemed to help with that.<br /><br />That all being said, the brace basically started falling apart within a week of using it and was completely useless at the end of 2 weeks. The shoulder part was fine, but the foam and and neoprene around the sleeve started ripping and tearing almost immediately. I'm not a big guy (5'6&#34; 125 lbs.) and I didn't wear the sleeve very tight either as it somewhat constricted blood flow if I did, so I'm not really sure why it started to break down so quickly.<br /><br />Againg, I really liked the product, but due to its lack of durability I cannot recommend it to others.
B00MNFN6O2|2|Even though the title says CT90, this is NOT a bolt on replacement for the stock CT90 (Honda Trail 90) carb.  You'll need an intake manifold that has the larger bore at the carburetor end and has the wider bolt spacing to fit this carb, but that still has the stock bore and bolt spacing at the end that bolts to the head.  I could not find such a manifold on Amazon, so I ordered the big bore carburetor intake manifold from DR ATV.  That intake manifold costs twice as much as this carburetor, so doing a cheap carburetor swap ended up being not so cheap.<br /><br />This is one of the better Chinese carburetors that I have seen, in terms of materials and quality.  It seems relatively well built.<br /><br />Other than needing fine tuning, it worked straight out of the box.  I got lucky though, because the jets in this carb are different from the jets that the original Keihin carb uses... and good luck finding odd jets to fit a no-brand Chinese carb.  My bike has a 110cc big bore kit, so this carb worked fine.  This carb would be too big, and jetted too rich, for a stock 90cc motor.
B00429NKWK|5|Excellent product, have recommended it to several friends.  Easy to use, makes lenses like new.
B004BTMSSS|5|Works

B00NJRGD70|5|Works well- easy to use!
B00BNDC1UA|5|Everthing as promised.<br />Quality product at an affordable price.<br />Easy install-- easy to follow instructions
B00IUE5S0K|5|It works well on vinyl dashboards.
B007CDYXZG|5|the two supplied O-rings and the filter fit perfectly in my Tundra.  The plug provided (opaque item in picture) to drain the oil from the housing is a little difficult to insert as the housing to insert it in is threaded.  I kept one from another oil change that was threaded and used that along with 2' of clear tubing to minimize the oil from getting everywhere.
B00EO1F9I4|4|Items work and are in perfect condition but made no improvement to my stock 50cc motor. My results may not be typical.
B00ESVYXDC|3|Work great but would be nicer if they came in sizes. Its just a little too big.
B000P7O5DG|5|Working Great
B00XQ6RA4E|5|Need to check bulb socket in your car before you buy it  .
B007HRRNA4|3|It did what it was supposed to do, but it is made out of a cheap pot metal type material.  Feels like it is going to break when you put some pressure on it.  Luckily it didn't, so hopefully it will keep working like it is supposed to.
B003NU0EM8|1|did nothing to help with a tiny ding on my car.  Maybe better used for something else
B00KTIQLXI|5|Key was delivered on time had it cut by local locksmith no problem. Works well need to get it programmed next.
B00NH7HCTA|5|Lowerd the car to the prefect height a little more rough then stock but not bad
B00D9C2CDO|4|This served it's purpose but was a bit hard to zip and unzip on top of our minivan.  Overall, worked well.
B00Y5O5ZU2|5|Look cool
B00DBENCMK|5|Awesome lights work great gotten so many people asking were I got them from
B00GJXM0DC|5|Exactly like the original.<br />I installed in a Honda Civic 2006 2dr. The installation took around 30 seconds and no issues at all. Fully recommended.
B00A9Z9X8G|5|Just as advertised.
B0006Z9SRA|1|terrible product, better off using water as this product leaves streaks all over my new car that I thought would go away. However now I can't get rid of the streaks at all. Leaves my less than a month old car looking terrible. Picture is in the morning after wiping at night. Highly HIGHLY AVOID THIS PRODUCT.
B000C7TQFG|5|five stars, very good product
B00ANTXWBW|5|nice!
B00PIUYUKI|5|Got it fast and perfect fit
B009DJN46G|5|regulator was packaged very well... clean and greased... ready to go . it came with all the nuts to mount the motor, and was an exact fit.  operation is smooth and flawless.  I would recommend this product to anyone having window difficulty.  installation was not a problem at all... everything fit like factory fresh.
B000BY6HCA|4|Not a perfect fit, but really helps out in the 100 degree Texas heat.
B00LN3Q9XA|2|I measured current draw at 12 volts and found that this is only a 10 Watt lamp. Else, I liked it.
B00KQX5EDO|5|Went in smoothly and stopped the Verizon Fios beeping.
B00D3298A0|5|Awesome floor mats! I bought them for my husband's truck ('14 F-150), and they fit perfectly. We wanted to protect the original floor mats from dirty work boots and rain/mud/snow.  These will definitely be very easy to clean, especially during our messy winters. They are very sturdy, and I imagine we will get many years of use from them.
B004TR8M3W|5|Great Product!
B003YBVU2E|5|The pipes are awesome.  The shipping time was great.
B008N69E6O|5|Best deal I could find on this product.
B00B6CTKUM|5|Good
B000COPDHY|2|It functions as intended, but was unaware it was PLASTIC when ordered.  Will use it until it breaks, then will replace with something that will last.
B003TNHEO0|2|The description says &#34;air flow seat cushion&#34; but it does NOT allow the air to flow like I want.  It is fine as a cushion but do not expect it to be like the ventilated seat cushions.  I bought this for my husband to use in his VW that doesn't have A/C and it doesn't help at all.  I think the main use for this would be if you have vinyl seats and want to not be scalded if the car has been in the sun; but we need something with more ventilation.
B00760R6KY|5|Exactly as described! Would definitely reccomend it! Fast shipping,great product!
B00L3LEEYS|1|Didn't work
B000EQQYHI|5|As advertised
B000GD5FMY|4|I have deep set eyes so seal was not perfect. Otherwise great product for the price.
B006WKQZUQ|1|Do not buy this. Ours shredded to pieces the first weekend towing the boat. Now it's too late to return it. Very dissatisfied.
B000GAQ12K|1|Ordered and returned 2 of these jacks. They are not as pictured. In addition both jacks were missing the top dust cover. Too bad they were just what we needed.
B00873J0YY|5|These roof racks are wonderful. A little difficult to put together at first, but well worth it. Only complaint is they should come with more heavy duty straps. Have used them numerous times since purchase and very happy so far!
B002ZBPXGS|5|Yes its a great combination of cleaner , protectant and shine
B00BGEO7DK|5|Fits exactly like I expected after reading the reviews. Would be nice if the rear had more coverage but I knew what I was buying
B003GYV8A8|5|Awesome stuff!  I don't even have a car but still works great on my keyboard.
B004IFOSH4|5|Perfect fit and extremely fast delivery
B00BPHOC6A|5|i haven't driven the rv yet but they seem to fit really good in fact i had trouble getting them on so i don't think they will come off and they look great
B000C7TTEE|5|Husband put the new radiator in with out a problem
B000GZQJ90|3|The part worked. What is there to say?
B000BZEHW6|4|Works as designed.
B00S1ZS5NU|2|nothing wrong with the product, just that it isn't compatible with my engine as the description and parts fit tool suggested.  I lost around $20 in the transaction due to this.
B0031BL3CE|4|Woke this KLR 650 up!!  Great sound!
B0000AXYLP|2|Disappointed, not nearly as good as powder for breaking down solids, or odor prevention !
B004RH9FS0|5|Good price, half what the dealer wanted, easy install, exactly the same as original,  high quality Motorcraft part, fast shipping,
B00H8V747Q|1|Why list something for sale if your not going to list fees associated with it.<br />Call, Seriously? If you charge for a core be upfront with people and list it.
B005JCTLFY|5|Nice cover.  Good size and quality.
B00FO6VWKW|5|This was a great purchase.  Now my son can buckle himself in all on his own and it makes everyone's life so much easier - I just do a quick check to make sure it is secure and you can hear the click so you know it is securely in place.  We especially need this in the winter on the east coast when you just want to get into the car as quickly as possible.
B000VU56IA|5|Really nice heavy weight mat ! Easy to install . Fast shipping . Everything they said it was . Thanks
B00USNP6M6|5|Exactly what I was looking for
B00RX14FIW|5|Spike grips fit good and I like the way they look on my bike
B007H5WUGI|5|I combined this with a couple of 30-15amp adapters and 10awg extension cords and now I can plug my RV in anywhere.  ANYWHERE!  So long as the two outlets are on a different breaker and neither one has a ground fault protection, this works MUCH better than the standard 50-30amp adapter.
B00CMSOOH8|5|Fit perfect...took 3-5 minutes to put on with tire on car!
B00T8BJ3QO|4|The adhesive is more convenient than using the clips on the fairing tool, but the disadvantage is that on convex forms the abrasive will pucker on the inside edge.  Of course that is not the fault of the paper, just worth noting.
B009IFIAPU|5|LOOKS GREAT AND EASY TO REPLACE.
B000NSLAIU|5|ordered 2 and they were spot on
B006DDHPDI|5|exelente
B00D9C2CDO|5|This cargo bag has far exceeded my expectations!  It is durable, waterproof, and huge.  It was like a giant backpack for my car!  We got stuck in heavy rain for 2 days straight and everything stayed dry.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing some extra packing space.  I also was able to strap it to my car rack which did not have the cross bars and it held just fine even on the interstate.
B00JRHI1LM|5|Great night sleep, Quality that will last.
B00TUKXRAQ|3|Does what is supposed to do.
B000NU2J2E|5|EXCELENTE
B00YDNX5S4|1|Not the right fit and cost me $20 to restock, not a happy customer.
B0000AY65X|5|Excellent product. I got a 87 four winns that has been sitting outside and the gel coat is very faded and oxidized, this product cleans it up with very minimal effort.
B00JOC1U8Q|4|Excellent product, I am satisfied.
B001BNASPM|5|Fit perfect in my husbands 2010 Nissan Altima
B00852MK30|5|Used two of these to mount light bar under the front racks on my grizzly 700
B00JA3BMDW|5|great item, makes taking temperatures a very easy task. The price was great.  Shipped fast.  Very happy with item, highly recommended.
B00EP3PW4M|5|Installed on my 2015 Ram Quad Cab.This part will not fit a Crew Cab.Make sure you research the correct product.First step is installing the three brackets per side.Take your time and make sure the plastic shield is on the bracket bolt.This will Prevent the bracket from falling down in the frame.The install is pretty easy.Once you do the drivers side the passenger side is a snap.
B005N53C9I|5|Living in Arizona with black leather seats is a big no no, and I love these covers! super soft, nice fit and they're durable!
B003NZ9E2E|4|Helmet fit good goggles and gloves ok for what you give for the helmet.
B00E1SLN1W|5|Perfect fit, easy install and great price. Save yourself a bundle of money and do this yourself!
B003IOKPLO|4|perfect for daily use. quality / price good ratio.
B000GU3KEC|5|is excellent to protect motorcycle from rainy
B005WWNQOS|5|Great product,great fit,expected new nuts for securing though.
B003HCASUK|5|very good
B009VI5TDU|5|Solved my starter problem!
B00IQFE32M|5|Great Product!
B000CMF55Q|5|Worked great on my 74 Thing
B00065ZIJ2|5|Works great!
B001B7TSSQ|5|This thing is very cool.  A bit pricy but practical and easy to install.  I'm thinking of buying another one for the other side.
B000YS7MT0|5|Fits good, I wear an 11 and they do slip on my feet a bit, a thicker sock will probably a little better. Like the toe shift protector and gives it nice style. The back zipper doesn't seem to bother at all and makes it a lot easier to get off and on.
B00B1VAKMU|5|Great
B004I0XJUG|5|Good
B002R0L3SO|4|nice aftermarket light
B003XFTUHI|5|great....
B007HGC9NQ|1|Single spark plug not a box of four as title of BX/4 suggests.
B00JBNYYQ8|5|Auto-Chem Direct sent me an email asking if their product arrived okay.  I was honest and said it did not work well on the scrape on my car. I was stunned today to see the following sent to me in an email:<br />Notes: I will refund your order.  Some scratches may require a power buffer to eliminate the scratch or scuff.  Thank you for trying our product.  Auto-Chem Direct.<br />So, I have to say that maybe my car paint was a little different, or I wasn't strong enough to buff it well enough, but obviously this is a company with a great deal of character, and I want everyone to know that.
B00CM589B8|5|I would give it 6 stars if I could. It is large, thick, wonderfully soft and ONLY $10, half the price of one I bought locally that is half the size and half the thickness. I'm sure it'll be a great cleaning aid, but I can also say with certainty that doubled, a small piece of it makes a great violin shoulder pad.
B009TEOFHC|5|Perfect
B00PJHYDPW|4|Nice unit. Very retro.
B00OPV81VU|5|Love the quality and fitment but need to order a new set due to idiot running my bike over
B0050JTA6Q|5|Nice
B008TT01J4|5|Goes on great. I like the way it leaves a natural warm look to the leather. This product does not make the leather look shiny and also adds original look like when it was new. Also no perfume added  just natural true leather smell.
B0002NYDZI|5|Threw brand new on out from Home Depot which was nothing in quality compared to this and the price is super reasonable.  Can be filled three different ways.
B000V6T5BI|1|So i used it today on my laptop and its been messing up since it wont let me back space, press enter, nothing I need the number for the company and my money back someone will reimburse me for my laptop cause this is crazy. I used it just as directed.
B00M07T2EG|5|Flawless. Light, Strong, Breathable, Comfortable, Good fit, Looks good. 100% Recommended
B003GBJ3V2|1|Broke before i could even put it on my hitch. There is a little weld that broke that keeps the lock together. Garbage.
B00JINPJD8|5|works as advertised
B00396BD6M|5|used once  since I purchased works great.
B000CQFUIY|2|Part was different than the model shown.
B0012LCX5Q|5|Very good does the job well.
B000IYYFMW|5|Fit my ford escape perfectly. Same as oem parts.
B0004ELKC4|4|Seems to work as advertised, but you probably can get a similar product at a local auto hardware store for less.
B0002NIJUS|3|mud guard fit good and looks good. they are designed to fit most any truck. I would recommend this product
B005C2ACBI|4|fantastic product, but bulky.  I find the 1&#34; version to be much more useful.  they both only go to 10', so you need two of them to hold down anything sizeable, but totally love the retractable nature of the thing.
B0101A0C38|5|Fantastic
B000VU7NL8|5|fit perfect just as discribed.
B000JU1F1E|5|I like it.  Holds all my change, so it's not bouncing around in my pocket.
B00AJTZCFU|5|Very great product included new washers received product very quickly.
B00B2ATTUE|4|Wow what a difference, I wish I would have got these years ago. Make sure you get a pair. I have a Lacrosse and had to get these extra wide ones which cost quite a bit more which was disappointing compared to the regular ones from the same company. They will install over tire covers. They are great ,but you pay for them. I think it will be worth it in the long run though.
B00KL3ALGO|4|This product is cool. I can see through it sitting on the driver seat. Also my baby is protected from sun sitting on the booster seat.<br /><br />It's good.
B000WJA5ZY|5|As always, RAM makes a great product.  Holds firm and solid.<br />These are metal arms with a metal bolt.  No worry about bending or stripping components.  Good and solid design.
B000CEG472|5|There a little bigger that the black ones, So they work a little  better ..
B0050FY5H4|5|Perfect fit for factory bore. Didn't even have to file the rings. Wiseco is quality....
B00192JFBI|5|This will definitely keep the bugs out.
B0079RM55K|4|The 12&#34; Fork Bag made it safely to Alaska and back (10,923 miles) full of tools.  It was covered in road construction mud several times but cleaned up nicely and never came loose. I am not sure why but it never filled with rain water even though I rode in the rain on separate 20 days.
B001NYKKTI|5|Perfect replacement. Stopped the leaked causes by a generic plug.
B00LAV2BVO|3|2 out of six bad within 2 days after install.
