B006PKV4C2|1|Smells so bad and it was ripped! This took too long to come and at the end it was so sad to find out that it wasn't worth it the wait!
B00CB4LL3I|4|Nice.
B006SRTFXW|4|My husband works part time delivering pizza's at night and needed the extra warmth.<br />He can't run in bulky pants so these are perfect for him and keep the cold out.
B00HN3KA5W|4|I was so excited about this top! It arrived faster than I expect which was great. I orderd a small. I am 5'3 108lbs, and was swimming in this. I tried it on and my brother asked me if I got a new dress. I looked down at the shirt and realized it was actually a dress on me :( wish it would have worked. Excellent customer service just didn't work. Also I did not realize the shirt was sparkly. Could not tell through the photo. It is pretty regardless.
B00NZT0ZGW|5|True 2 size! Love it!!
B0024VUZ9E|1|These may be silk, but it is not a quality silk.  These boxers should be in a 2-pack at Wal-mart. The colors are not as shown.  They fly is off-centered (I have never seen anything like this before).  They appear to be cheaply made and constructed. Customer service is not very fast. I am sending them back and I cannot recommend this product. I would have given them no stars, but that is not an option.
B00KNSWBHY|5|it is very perfect. I like it.
B00L99WFVS|5|Daughter loved this! She usually wears a 14/16 in clothing. This was a tad tight in the arms. Other then that it was super cute, she loved it!
B000VX8XIC|1|These nightgowns are cute, but we've had three Sara's Prints gowns fall apart at the seams (the ruffle tears loose).   I wrote the company, but they  actually said that they \\"couldn't help\\" and that I'd need to return the gowns to the store where I'd bought them.   Hmmmm  . . . how many people do you know who save receipts after wearing and washing their clothes?   I know I don't.       So, I'm stuck with 3 different gowns that fell to pieces and will never buy another product from Sara's Prints.
B001FOR1Q6|4|Good looking & feels like good quality.  But why don't they measure size to a point that it leaves more belt to tuck in?!
B00MIK2R4C|4|good sweater!
B0015Z5SM4|2|Legs are tight fitting
B00I3Q44V4|3|Good fit but see through !
B00EDO9PVE|4|My favorite Fun Shirt
B00C69XIWK|5|I love it. It goes with my hat
B0046EHFWM|1|Too small meet for a 4 ft women who have no breast
B00QR1PZHO|5|Cute and practical works for me
B004PBRGUC|3|cheapie looking and feel
B00FEES1Q2|4|It is a great hoodie fits perfect, I wish to get another but I want it in black. thank you
B00C20E5SO|4|Fits great very comfortable
B004N6YMO2|5|This was received in a filmy pink sack with silky cord tie. It will make a nice presentation when I give it as a Christmas present. the product is soft and a beautiful paisley, not too heavy, it will make a nice wrap!
B00F9F48AE|4|I normally wear a medium in everything, which is what I ordered for this skirt. What I received was a large...which was still very tight. The skirt is pretty, but I strongly recommend buying 2 sizes larger than normal if you want to be comfortable. I have to update this.....regardless of it being too tight...it eventually stretched and became one of the most comfortable things I own. I lived in this skirt over the summer and will be buying more. I changed my rating from 2 to 4 stars.
B00KCS5DGG|5|very good
B00FEOR7IU|3|These are nice socks received when stated only thing wrong was i ordered crew and got long knee socks took one pair our and had one long shock and one crew length
B0000YXTZY|4|I ordered these online to replace my favorite pair of Danskin yoga pants that were wearing out.  These new pants are lighter in weight than my old pair and contain more synthetics, but they are comfortable and sturdy. I had to shorten them quite a bit.  I would recommend them for their value - the price is good and they should hold up fine.
B008BLN5ES|5|They did great by us and even rushed the dress for us for a wedding when they didn't have to.  The dress was perfect and they responded each time I wrote with questions.  Very satisfied.
B008HN3NP6|5|will stay perfect my little thank you very much, that's what she asked me and she loved it, it's great maid, of my new purchases and wait until then, greetings
B008R50U5A|5|It was easy to work with this shipper. I have no complaints about them. Everything was great and without problem.
B00BV79VEC|5|Love these pants
B00AQ4HXBY|5|I wore this to work and was stunned at compliments.  wore it with a hip-placed thick black motorcycle-inspired belt and boots/tights.  will next wear it with red pumps and no tights.  it's very very nice.  I have several kamalikulture dresses but have to admit I've sent back just as many, some are too tight and look hootchy-kootchy.  this dress, although not 'tight', would not be forgiving of bloat or lumps.  I mean, it looks fine on my not-perfect middle aged body but I was glad I wasn't carrying extra weight.  appropriate undergarments help a lot.
B001T4XSGE|5|I read the reviews carefully before ordering this belt for my husband.  I purchased one size larger and it was fine.  Any larger would have been way to big and his correct size would have been too small.  He is very pleased and likes the fact that it is adjustable for his different types of pants.
B00HQC9LS2|5|I bought the Surf Blue and this colour is just great!
B00BIZUVVO|2|Not worth the price
B003MWQW46|4|I wanted to replace my old flight jacket with a new one. This was at a good price and it fit well. It was of very good quality.
B00K035D3G|3|It came exactly as pictured.  I got blue and yellow and it's beautiful.  However, I am only 5'3&#34; and it's very long.  It went well past my knees and overwhelmed my frame so I had to send it back.  The back is very sexy.  Something also to keep in mind, the tie is made of satin so it slips and would need to be retied often.  If I would have kept it that would have been a concern for sure.
B0043RXS28|5|My son loves it
B00719ZOM2|5|It is perfect and really comfortable
B00D4LVI8U|4|This is a blue cotton shirt that has the same colour of a chambray shirt. I love it because it is made of a thick yet soft fabric (it reminds me a bit to flannel). I also enjoy the pattern and the pearlish buttons, that's why I kept it even though I was specifically shopping for chambray or denim.
B00800ANU4|5|I am 5'9&#34; and have a 34 waist and a bit of a belly at 180# and usually pack a glock 36 on my belt fully loaded with cell phones ipod pliers a buck 119 a surefire flashlight and a pound of keys.  I finally decided like most old men I didn't have a butt anymore since my pants kept trying to fall off.  I remembered my child hood days when you kept your pants up with suspenders aka braces. I don't think they had invented belts then.  I picked up a set of cheap ones at Elsewhere general store and found them barely but definitely satisfactory, and wore them out to the point they attracted comments, so I sprung for the high dollar stuff, I think an extra three bucks and what a difference.  The elastic is supportive but doesn't feel like a couple of bungies, when you move it moves with you but still maintains support.<br />all in all I am very happy with them.
B00C7K8KFI|4|Love the pants! Worth the money!
B00J2WIELY|4|This wallet is made well. I like the idea of it being different. A little awkward to use but worth it to have something out of the norm.
B00DS183CK|5|Perfect love it 😊
B00L389UI6|5|Good quality design with as expected sexy fit. This is a great item for any boutique specializing on modern, unique products.
B000147W60|5|Back when I received this bra, I was 38F (now I'm 36D). This is a smooth bra in larger sizes that's not extremely expensive, comfortable and of high quality. I didn't find this bra largely sized (at least in the size I wore), though note it's in UK sizes. If one is larger than any of the sizes listed, Fantasie makes a similar bra in larger sizes; the main difference is that it has a cradle cup to give more support.
B007W0XRKQ|5|I love heavenly shapewear! It doesn't look fake at all. I'm so happy I got it now it looks like i got a perfect fitting butt!
B00B5UDNGC|3|The large white lace crop top fit nicely, looks good and is very comfortable. The black was also a large but did not have the same stretch and feels more like a medium. It is not very comfortable but because I was taking these tops on vacation I did not exchange the black one and hopefully it will ease in fit over time!
B000F74LUS|5|These are just what i was looking for. They are comfortable and i don't have to worry about what might be  showing. I highly recommend this product and the cost was great
B00L1KXH4Y|5|This is my new favorite brand of jeans! Also have wallflower  khakis that are equally as comfortable.
B003JFJ4Q4|5|i bought this for my neice for  Christmas, she loves it.  picture is good and fabric nice,  only thing i would do in the future is order a size larger.  runs small.
B0081K93FY|4|good value
B000Z95ZO2|1|I received this as a gift .. It was missing the cord .. the person that gave it to me contacted AMAZON .. no satisfaction .. item was new in box or at least the box was new but the cord was broken off .. seller should have been ashamed.
B00DIS3QX4|1|so bad! it's too large,can not wear.
B006SRTFEQ|4|The waist is little  long,but fix is good
B005L3O0DY|5|The mens zip hoodie fit true to size. Great material and quality. I would recommend this zip hoodie to anyone.
B00L216JT2|3|Its listed as a loose dress.  Its hardly a adult top. Bought a large and it fits like a small T-shirt. I kept it because its a cute top.  But its not loose nor a dress.
B00P6OULIQ|5|Really like these, there are 6 pairs that fit my 5.5 year old very well, she likes to wear a different pair everyday, I like to have a lot of sets in case they are lost.
B00JQWEGHQ|5|Color of top exactly as pictured. Good quality material. Fits snug but not too tight. I like that this crop top allows me to wear a bra and is long enough that I feel sexy without showing a lot of tummy skin. I'm happy with this purchase.
B00O1CDJB0|5|Nice and snug great for 30 degree weather.
B0031K80SU|5|My son is very happy. He like it and the size was perfect. Sure he will buy another clothing as soon as possible
B004ZW1MFG|5|My little brother wanted a cowboy hat for Christmas.  This hat will work perfectly for him.  He is not a &#34;cowboy&#34; so the hat did not need to be any more expensive and nicer than this to make him happy.
B008BSWQ7S|5|This garment can be a closet staple. It's keeping me warm and looks good.
B0106NQZC2|5|I really needed this item for an event. It arrived in the mail soo fast! And I love it it works good and makes me feel skinny.
B006PGGJOE|2|Just too small for my needs, had bought one two years ago at wal mart it was taller square, but can't find the size any longer, wish they would make it bigger
B008Q0E61U|4|Clips are well made and work as expected!
B00GS5RUIG|2|Thin material.
B002KFE9YQ|5|Exactly as described. Thanks!
B000ZHGBU6|4|Good thigh highs
B00ENKB9IA|5|Very comfortable
B00FW41JAO|5|She's not a nerd but enjoys when I buy her nerdy things to wear around the house. She loves this. And, they are very attractive on her too.
B00E5TIUZE|5|Great running shorts, i think this is the perfect length for shorts, they have both draw cord and inner support and a small pocket for keys which for me is extremely useful (in my old pants I used to put the keys on the waistband cord...)<br />All in all, good quality product, worth the extra $$
B00OSRRZ72|5|Very nice coat
B004GIYAE4|1|Kids toys....not adult!!!!!!
B00S6YLUR4|1|Poor quality
B00A4EPSNG|4|Quality construction and materials.  Compartments are well thought out and appropriately sized.  Hopeful this will last longer than the two Fossil wallets that preceded it.
B000OAZC5Y|3|Fits good but the material isn't the same as if I had gone to a department store. Pockets and belt loops wear out too early.
B00OV5XT62|5|Great skirt that can also be used as a dress
B002NJQ3Z2|1|It was WAY too small. I was very disappointed. All of my other bras are this size and they fit me just fine.  This one was impossible to get on...
B009RAE8NO|5|It looks like the picture and it fit nice not to loose but not to tight and i feel comfortable in it. You can dress it up with straight legs pants or leggings and a heel or wear the same thing but wear it with sneakers and you will look cute.
B00EDCZST4|5|Very good.
B00LNCEAUK|5|Superb quality and design. great rich blue color. You won't be disappointed. The fit is excellent and the length of the sleeve is 33/34. It was bought on sale.
B0058W5XFW|3|nice economy sized wallet
B008R81196|5|This was purchased as a gift and they love it. Fits right in with the Star wars theme for the babies room
B00DTWCOHS|5|This is awesome! It fits perfect and it looks great too! It is also super comfy! It is an AMAZING BUY!<br />Size-34ddd
B0070TYUNM|5|I love this sleep shirt. It fits great and is very comfortable. I wear it around most of the day--it looks like a casual house dress.
B00OL7KUOE|4|I purchased the running tights to keep warm in the cooler winter temperatures we have in Florida.  They fit well and are comfortable to run and do help keep me warm.
B00EKNQV06|5|Love this shirt!!
B0098MLY1A|1|Earrings were more or a faded purpleish pink then the pictured hot pink. Didn't even bother wearing them to my hubby's work party.
B006SRTFHI|4|I ordered two pairs. They are well made and warm. One fit perfectly, while the other was a trifle smaller around the waist, but still usable.
B0018OZENU|5|Geat!
B00505DUPC|3|Wore this once for warrior dash, so it was fit for it's purpose.  I read the reviews for this shirt and bought a size larger then I normally wear, but then if fit as I expected a Medium would fit.  The shirt was soft and was a women cut.  The ring was huge and was even big when my guy friends tried it on.  The mask eye holes were small, but looked great for pictures for the short time I wore it.
B004IMANXK|4|These socks fit good but they are a little thinner than expected.
B000N8TFFU|4|The guy in the picture should look more happy! He is wearing a totally sweet shirt! I like mine and it fits well. A little short in the sleeves for me, but someone once told me that I have a plus 1 ape index (a little long armed). So, I roll my sleeves up a little bit, just like in the picture, which makes me feel as if I am working harder than I really am.
B00LX0KSIA|5|Really like this.  Looks just like picture.
B0072IHU5G|4|nice quality and sturdy material id say get it one size smaller so it wont be too long.
B001O0EI26|5|These shorts arrive sooner than I expected and the shorts were not cheaply made. These shorts were great for my son who plays basketball. The entire team ordered theirs from Amazon once they saw his shorts.
B008FD0KP4|1|The jean's cut was not what I was hoping for and it was too large so I had to return it. Fortunately the vendor was nice to take it back and give me a refund.
B007PEHW1Y|5|fits great and works as advertised.  Black seems to slide down but white has a more secure fit.
B00N8ISG4I|5|So cuddly!  My daughter loves it!
B00AW18V44|5|I have had this Chums float strap for a very long time.  I've never had any trouble with it, and can always find it in a heartbeat.  Highly recommended...
B00M744ECM|5|I love these so much. I read the reviews and got a size down and they fit perfectly. Yes, because they are lace the edges still rub a little bit on my skin but it's nothing compared to heat rash from chafing. I wear a size 18 so anything that can help me feel sexy is a plus. These are incredibly sexy and useful. They're no miracle that suddenly makes my inner thighs totally protected, but they do their job and do it better than bulky shorts or just deoderant.
B009PY22W6|5|I am the office top gun now
B00PAWLL5G|1|Felt like children's size 6x...I normally wear a 4 and I couldn't even get these above my knees...horrible sizing!
B00IUGDA26|3|Large at the waist and hangs below the knee.  If it was any longer I would wear a baseball cap backwards and learn gang signs.
B00SU6QO4W|2|The product came smashed and deformed so I had to send it back for a refund, but I was also underwhelmed by the quality of the hat itself. It was very flimsy and didn't feel like a quality product. I'll be thinking twice buying a hat from HUF again, which is unfortunate because they have some great designs.
B005VM8ATA|1|The length is pretty long but other than that its not worth buying. it is very shinny you can  definitely  tell its fake. Also the hair gets tangled really easy and its thin. So its not worth your money dont buy it!
B008ES86TM|3|The hoodie is about what you expect for the price. It's not terrible, but definitely has a sizing issue. The arms are a bit short for the size, and the left arm was about an inch shorter than the right. It feels a bit short for the girth, so going up a size is probably not the answer.
B005VFAOJ6|2|UPDATE: the layers of these lenses are separating after 13 months. there is a 1 year warranty so thats annoying. ill give them credit, these lenses have been through a lot including pool water, salt water, drops and other stuff but i cant help but think that oakley branded lenses would hold up better than this. probably going to buy the oakley lenses over these from now on. probably worth the investment.    old review: These replaced my stock lenses and I think that it was one of the better decisions ive made for a long time. The normal lenses were wayyy too light and these are perfect to my liking. Glare is gone, and they fit perfectly into the frames. Id suggest looking at youtube videos to find out how to swap them out correctly.
B005MFHORK|5|Perfect.  Love it
B004BD14M0|4|Excellent, but a little too big, I wish it was smaller
B00AWLXEUU|5|Really dresses up a pair of plain boots
B0078X6VV4|4|I recommend it big time, found it very high quality jacket with comfort material and stylish look. I see it very nice.
B00XTDJMQS|3|CUTE BUT RUN A BIT SMALL.
B00I4QTI6Y|5|good
B000KGIBZA|5|Very nice hosiery for church - colors are great and very sheer which is nice - not expensive at all
B00SMA4AJC|4|This is super cute but picture looks green, it's definitely yellow.
B0000DK8ZE|4|The leather is soft, they fit snugly and are warm.  However they are weak in the seams. One seam started coming apart on about the third wearing.
B0055QNLR8|4|I wore it every day for several weeks. It helps the knee ache I experienced. Elastic stays snug. When you sit; it does bunch behind the knee and that can get uncomfortable after a bit.
B000MX920O|5|I wasn't sure but the description sounded fine.  This is the most comfortable, well fitting and well made bra that I have had in some time.  Not padded, smooth lines, washes terrific and no stays! Amazing.
B005CIX54S|5|this is the last wallet I will ever own.  its slim n trim n rides great in my front pocket
B00DS3G9EM|5|This shirt is awesome...It feels lilke you are wearing a t-shirt...It looks and feels great on me....I recommend this to anyone.
B001UE749A|4|Was a gift.  They seemed very satisfied with it. They transferred everything into the wallet and used it right away
B009R8AV6O|5|I bought these for my 12 year-old, and it is hard to find this style for girls her age. These fit perfectly and she looks adorable in them! I would recommend these!
B00B10ZN0K|5|Very good quality material used to make this shirt and the fit is comfortable. The saying is also funny so enjoy wearing this shirt.
B00OTM624I|4|Levis. How can you go wrong? Made well. Look good. Fits great. If you're a regular Joe like me, you don't need high falutin' premium brand jeans. You gotta be nuts to spend $100 on jeans unless you are so flush, it's nothing more than a drop in the bucket.<br />Best looking pair of jeans I own.
B00M2HQ5OO|3|Bottoms fit great but the material is really see thru and wouldn't feel comfortable wearing in public might slip out of the top.
B00EE17UM2|5|love the representation just smaller than sized and shrinks easily even when washed correctly.
B00KVY0668|4|I not a bodybuilder and I ordered small but the sleeves are somewhat uncomfortable. I tend to wear it as a lazy shirt basically. Don't trust the picture if you order small
B004R1IBTK|5|This is a good product  for the price.<br />I am a size zero and this shirt fits me perfectly in a medium.  Just slouchy enough and comfortable.
B004OOI6SG|5|its cute nice and heavy and seems well made will fit nicely in my collecion of cameos hanging on my wall
B00OKZLAEQ|5|Yes!
B000JHFUTK|4|they fit perfect at the waist but the &#34;tapered&#34; legs are way too bog at the cuff. i have a pair of regular fit jeans with narrower cuff.
B005HJ8P4C|5|Very satisfied with coveralls.
B00NFET4OG|1|I ordered an adult small and what arrived would fit a 6 yr old.  The waist measures 9 3/4&#34; across with shorts laid down flat.  Additionally, the quality is poor as the elastic sewn into the waist seems to be cut in half  and damaged.  Even if I could fit into them, they wouldn't hold up.  I'm hoping this is a one off and I'll be returning the item.  Disappointing as I needed them this evening!
B00KCPXO7O|5|This dress is so sexy
B00LFSE7OQ|4|This is a fun lightweight bucket hat. The colors are vibrant and the design is a lot of fun. I get compliments on it every time I wear it.
B00Y3YGV84|5|my wife just loves this skirt.
B00596VYQE|5|lovely,
B00GP204SK|3|The PJ's are good for the price - the material is quite thin and there are large spaces between the snaps so cold air can get in during the winter.
B008DS4L7O|5|I bought this for my 2 years and 8 months daughter. She usually wears 3T, but I got the 4T, because I didn't want it to be too fit. The jacket is super cute, the size was exactly what I was expecting, it's lightweight, and seems perfect to wear during winter time, even in snow days as a last layer.
B0013EE0K8|5|Useful for carrying things, sturdy
B004IYIMRC|5|That's perfect.I like it so much
B009H23DYC|5|Shirt fit well and looked just as good as the one in the picture.
B0011RP5Y2|5|Very happy
B00Y5PGBCM|5|Muy buen producto
B00ISMKPIE|3|A lot smaller than expected, thank goodness when I ordered it, I ordered a size bigger because my daughter normally likes bigger shirts.
B00ADKYQES|4|They are not heavy duty gloves, but the simple cotton type.<br /><br />They work exactly as advertised, however I have seen then for a little cheaper in strange but select places (a gas station in Yuma, AZ)<br /><br />They were a gift for my mother and she loved them.
B00COW0CNW|1|I placd this order, first it took forever. And then when I get it, its the wrong size! I ordered a xs. they sent a large. Im so disappointed. and it is not worth returning and waiting for it to be shipped back
B009N0CT02|3|I like it, but I think it would be even better if it was thicker. But it's a good fit.
B01115O4TU|1|Honestly it wasn't worth buying.... Wish I could return it
B00M3604Y6|4|Exactly as described. Very comfortable and looks great.
B002QIFDCY|5|I bought this for my 15 year old nephew for Christmas.  He goes to a school with a dress code, and he told me that he only had one tie he liked.  When he got this gift, he liked it.  The quality is good.  It has a nice simmer.
B001EH4DWO|2|These shirts are cheaply made (for ex. the hems are not finished), so I don't expect them to last as long as my Haynes...
B00X2BV0AI|3|I love it but I order accordingly to size chart and I know what fits my body and it's still too small. I waited so long for this too.
B00OPEBVGY|5|Love it
B00C5KNUPA|1|I had hoped for a skinny leg large wasted Jean. It is comfortable in the waist but larger all over. A baggy fit
B007YJ2FXA|5|These socks are really cute and having the set of them is great because there's a pair of socks for every outfit. They fit perfectly fine for my son and he's been using them for the past 2 months.
B0090CKKEK|5|Cheap and does the job! If you need extra cleavage, these bad boys really help in corsets and tank tops.
B00HR9IOWS|4|Great product, stays on my foot and does not show around my shoes!  Thanks!!
B00F13KQRI|5|Excellent purchase and service
B00GNU1AFA|4|The support is awesome and the cup size is right-on, but the ribcage size runs very small. Fortunately I had an extender that I could use. I usually wear a 32D, but I should have ordered at least a 34.
B00LHR9XVW|5|Excellent product
B00M8NMNIE|1|It wasn't even close to being a Ladies XLg!!
B00FEM648Q|5|Very nice coat !  Bought it for my grandson , he loves it.  Good fit on the coat, normal 5-6
B00FVRCI98|4|This is nice but it does run a bit bigger due to the nature of the kind of tank it is. It is supposed to be loose fitting and you wear a bandeau or something under it. The material is thin and it did not shrink at all. It is cute though.
B00E8X8MGY|5|Oh my gosh!  I love this T-Shirt!  I rarely wear t-shirts for anything but working out because they make me feel like I look like a guy.  I decided to try this v-neck, and I'm so glad I did.  The fit is great, it is very well made, and the most comfortable t-shirt I have ever had.  I'm about to order some more.
B00JOTTZC2|1|Pro: Nice design; kind of compact but a lot of slots for everything.<br />Con: Quality; I've had it for less than a month, and the left side of the ID pocket completely tore/opened up yesterday. I don't use my ID that often, so it hasn't gotten a lot of use in that area. This is really disappointing!
B001MCBHHK|1|Nice
B000HKY6N0|5|Well researched, clearly written and presented guide on all the stages of pregnancy. Loved this book and would highly recommend it to anyone, especially for a first pregnancy.
B000QAS2SG|4|Not top quality , but a screaming bargain for the price! Well made. Quality zippers on top and side pocket. Highly recommend.
B00NIL9CF2|4|Warm, well made, works like they say on the screens -almost always.
B00CKNQRJI|5|Love this top, very comfy. Shipping, etc great also.
B00LJTXXF0|5|Bought this as a gift.  He likes the fit and color.
B00063A8O4|5|I searched high and low for just the right briefcase to replace my old one. This is a beautiful briefcase - inside and outside. Great workmanship and attention to details. I like the way it is lined with material inside, instead of just suede. The compartments are spacious and the pockets inside are well laid out. The hardware is beautiful and solid. My old briefcase was black leather. I was ready for a change and wanted a more sophisticated looking bag. The belting leather is beautiful in the tan color that I got. However, it is going to show scratches that \\"will give it character\\" so don't get this specific bag in the belting leather if visible scuffs and scratches are going to bother you. It is also nice to buy American, and have a lifetime guarantee. I did order and look at a Floto Firenze brief from Italy that was of a similar large size - no comparison. The Italian bag had nice leather, but just lacked some of the finishing details of this Jack Georges bag. Finally, the Jack Georges bag is pretty light for a leather briefcase of its size.
B008X1FJVI|2|I love the shirt but I never got to wear it because I was sent the wrong size. Wish it would have been my size
B00J3QHKWS|5|It was great
B005LLQC8W|1|I'm a freeze baby so I wear knee high socks all winter long.  I thought these were very attractive and they came pretty quick.  I was disappointed, however, when I put them on for the first time.  They were pretty snug.  I couldn't wait to take them off at the end of the day.  When I did take them off it was then I realized just how tight they were.  I had indents in my legs where the top of the socks rest, right under the knee.  It had actually cut off circulation in my legs a bit.  I had to rub my legs because it was a bit painful.  I will try and stretch them out as much as I can and try again.  The thing is, I am 5'5\\", 117lbs. I don't have big calves. Quite the contrary. So whoever sized these for women better try again.  These are way too tight.  The only reason I gave these socks even 1 star is because they are very attractive and the material is nice.  Too bad they are unwearable.
B007IEGIRU|5|I choose this rating because it looked very well detailed and it looks like exactly as its pictured. I couldn't be any more happier than i am right now! It's a perfect fit as well!! I'm 5'6 and I was a size Large. Also, it was awesome looking and its super cool!! You can check out my review on this costume on Youtube. Go to pepe2342 and its called &#34;The Superman Morphsuit Review&#34; . Check it out!
B007NEOJRQ|5|fabric feels nice on skin and extra length is wonderful. I ordered five more for gifts this year. Only issue is that the package was damaged upon arrival - scarves were ok though.
B00L60JEM8|4|Easily snags. Pretty sweater though. But it already has several large snags and piling after just a few weeks.
B00CLVM7XO|2|I had purchased a B String hat  from the Yawkey store. It was a better quality hat so I was expecting a similar product but this was a cheap imitation
B004FG2MAG|5|I ordered a dozen of these shirts with different pictures on each and I must say they are really nice shirts.
B00865EBPG|5|this is one of my favorite tops....don't care too much for the snaps on pockets, but color and comfort are great
B00CK5FIL4|5|This really is a great style with great fit and great craftsmanship. The fabric is great quality cotton and the trunks retain their fit after many washes and wear well. My new favorites!
B0097SHHJI|2|This mask looks great, I scared a lot of people I only wish I had know it was so much bigger, I'm an adult and my head swims in the thing...so the mask doesn't really work for head tilts and the such like it does in the movies. However, with it being so big it makes the eye-holes even darker and creepier...so there's your trade-off. Would have given three stars if this thing didn't shed worse than my cat and actually fit
B00N9OPMMU|5|Fantastic. Exactly as ordered.
B00DNUVCMY|3|Very pretty coat but poor quality of workmanship. First, some of the buttons came off. Next, the stitching in the hood has started to come off. And it has been only 1 month since purchased. Returning this.
B00V5IU5YW|5|Best bra worth your money. Fits perfectly. I'll buy more soon
B00NNFP252|2|Way way to small had to give it to my 14 yr old daughter...so up set cause i really need clothes and it seems every time i order some fit and others are way to small..it came fast and in good,shape....my daughter loves it..
B00C1SUK2M|1|The photo is very deceptive, it was ridiculously wide, more than two inches, there was no way on earth it was going to fit in standard belt loops. Total waste of money.
B00NZU62A4|2|It was way smaller than I thought it was going to be. It look like it was ment to be worn by a little girl not a full grown women. They should have a model wearing it instead of that piece of wood so you can see what it will look like on someone.
B001VGQUP6|2|After an hour of wear, a hole burst in the seam & they couldn't be worn.
B0007CKMK4|5|nice jeans
B00E8CMP7C|1|Don't buy this!  It runs very, very small!
B0083XI7E2|2|they fit good and I received them in good time but they is no quality to them at all. a T-shirt is thicker than they are and will keep you warmer. I will be sending them back not worth the money- there no fabric!
B007F50Q9S|5|love this bathing suit.  My favorite for travel this winter.  she looks ready for a great day at the beach.  must buy
B00R5C0IPI|1|They're awesome. Sadly, I got two dud pairs and wore them once each and they both have holes in them. I had to throw one pair out because of the hole. Anyway I can get a replacement sent to me because of this? I can upload proof of the holes, just let me know!
B00IQG86ME|1|I'd like to return it please.
B007MT5OHG|5|Really good jersey. The exact jersey like the picture shows. The jersey is original in every way and for a low price.
B003IBO14E|4|Just what we were looking for, comphy, sturdy, cute, and warm. My son wore it all night and for dress up.
B00KNVVRCG|1|Way too small, did not fit as expected at all
B004M5I4DE|5|I got this for my brother's birthday as he is a big David Bowie fan and he loved it. He's a tall guy and it was long enough for him, fit him well and he wears it very often.
B00J0ETC2O|5|Fabric is soft and stretchy. Fits perfectly. Would buy more of these!! (just not in black, the black ones are not as confy and they don't fit as well as the others, returned the black ones...)
B007KX9VSW|1|I ordered these for a trip I'm going on tomorrow, they came today. I used a fabric measuring tape and my waist comes to 33.5 inches, so I purchased the ones with the 33in waist. There are about 3 extra inches on the waist of the product and they just fall off of me. Tightening with the drawstring does nothing to help. I had to have them altered to actually get them to fit at all.<br /><br />The material is nice and I like the cut of the suit, but I would not buy from them again. I bought another pair of a different brand from amazon and they were a 34in waist and fit perfectly.
B007PFYCPC|5|its the same as the picture...i really like it.. the only downside for me is the length, its a bit too long for me but i def recommend it.
B0084Y99MO|5|3 year old loves his George stuff
B009T59WQK|3|I have three of these now and love them however on each one the cups fit a little differently.  It's not enough to bother me but I do have to adjust once in a while of this one.
B004XKG6ME|5|Nice!!
B00J2CKHHI|5|Fits true to size. Great color and quality
B0050HOJEG|5|so cute
B011ADAJSI|5|Probably one of the best values in lingerie. Comfortable fit and wears forever.
B00HU256E6|5|These are such cute little sunglasses. I love the little anchor on the sides. I got these as part of a gift for a co-worker, and she seemed to love them as well. I like that the plastic isn't super hard so that it has a little &#34;give&#34; when putting them on your baby's face. You feel confident that the plastic arms won't snap and hurt your child.
B005LW6KZG|5|We purchased this for our daughter as she loves to wrap up in a robe after bath time. She loves the variety of colors and it is very warm.
B008EWZM1S|3|After wearing them one day, the ear<br />Part came a broke off at the screw. I was not able to fix them. I really liked them a lot and they were a hit at my work Christmas party. It would be a hassle for me to return them. I just wish they would not have broken so quickly. The Santa hat was perfect.  Thank you Tipsy<br />Elves.
B004M17L78|3|I ordered a size up as recommended by other reviewers and I'm glad I did. The fit is good but I'm a little disappointed in the quality. I washed the jeans after receiving them (without wearing them yet) and found that the seam in the belly band now has a hole. I was taking the jeans to a seamstress anyway to get them hemmed (I'm 5'5 and only wear flats so they were a little long) and she's fixing the seam as well. Still, brand new jeans shouldn't have an unraveling seam. I'm very glad I got these jeans on sale or I would be sending them back.
B00O4R78LO|5|Very stylish and comfortable.  I have both the black and navy.  They are the perfect weight and length.
B00CF59R5C|5|This sweater is really beautiful.  In fact, it is so beautiful that when I opened the package and tried it on, my husband said, \\"wow!  that looks really nice!\\"  The pictures shown don't do it justice, and although they show the *fit* of the sweater perfectly, in my opinion the details and quality of the yarn are excellent.  Especially for how well priced these sweaters are.<br /><br />One note: I purchased the white sweater, but it is more of a light ivory color.  I still love it and have received many compliments both times that I've worn it.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004ZYE9F4|5|Made my sheepskin rug soft and fluffy like new! I'm so glad I bought this item instead of paying tons for professional cleaning.
B000SN17BK|4|The wife likes it. So, there ya go.
B00EHX4GKQ|4|I was looking for some lounge pants for hubby that were a lighter weight than flannel.  These are just what he wanted.  I do wish the fabric was a little softer but overall a good purchase.
B00JUM9NR0|5|Holy hell is this sweatshirt comfortable. I bought it expecting to be average sweatshirt and hoodie material, but man was I wrong. This is one of the most comfortable sweatshirts I've ever worn. It's not too heavy, it's seriously warm, it's super soft and the best part is that it's a raglan cut, which is the most comfortable cut of clothing. 10/10 would buy again.
B00440CYD8|5|Excelente el diseño, material y tamaño... recomendado! No ocupa tanto espacio y es ideal para guardar todas las cosas... Excelente
B00HHOXSGK|5|Roomy, warm, and comfortable.  Got a lot of compliments too.
B008AMFJ6K|4|My Hubby says they are quite comfy! He likes the plaids and I got different colored tees to match them.
B00WQ7HRR4|5|Absolutely love these dresses. I have 5 different styles by Sakkas & love them all!!
B00A8D5MQG|3|This was way too small and the minute i washed it the petals curled into each other.
B00092O78A|3|It took a little longer for it to arrive. But our grandchild loves to wear it. It did start to fray after wearing it just two times
B00740RFHA|4|It was slightly large, and I ordered the proper size for me. I have a large bust, and still it was slightly baggy in the chest area. Is is designed to be very low cut, so that probably explains the amount of fabric up top, but with a 36DDD I still didn't fill the cups. For the price it was perfect! I wore it to a fancy summer wedding and it was flow-y and cool all night. I bought a deep V body shaper to wear under it for support and smoothing. Paid less than $20 to get it altered down to the right fit. Overall pretty happy with it!
B000WYXPP6|4|Great item for anyone looking do do some prosthetic makeup.  The spirit gum worked great.  I can not comment on the remover because I did not use it.  I had something left over from the year before
B00CE91HGQ|4|This was the perfect practical Halloween costume for my 9 year old. It fits great and it's detailed enough to make a good costume but not too much to not be wearable at any time.
B00NTYB64S|5|Fit was perfect however I knew to order a size bigger than normal as designer clothing is always smaller than standard clothing that motto has never failed me. very happy chappie cheers dink
B001M4SSB6|3|I ordered this hat because I wanted an Bogey Fedora.  I liked the hat but it was too large for me (I am female)and it was not offered in small so I ordered the medium hoping it might fit.  It did not.  The hat is small overall which I did not like either so I returned it.  I was promtly given a no-hassle credit which I appreciated.  Will look for a larger type \\"Bogey\\". The company gave good, prompt service.
B004R1JZQI|5|Got this for school. Wanted something thinner, light weight, and loose/flowy. I bought a medium in black and the material is soft and thin and good quality. The color is also very nice and doesn't lok like it will be fading much.  Will be buying again in future :)<br /><br />- I have now had this shirt for a year and loved it all year long.  It went really cute with my uniforms and it lasted.  I bought it as a sweatshirt and I wore this shirt pretty much every day for a whole school year.  I washed it every three days and the material held up while the color has only faded a small bit.  Very worth the buy in my case.
B008RMH35I|3|The pants fit very well. The bad part is that, after a few days of wear, and one washing, the material of one of the flaps over one of the snaps, frayed. The back part of the snap is now visible and surrounded by shredded material<br />Bummer. I may send back the second, unworn, pair.
B00G361PC2|5|This coat is a nice addition to any professional wardrobe.  I love the subtle pattern and keen tailoring.  It fits beautifully over a suit but also isn't too bulky when worn over something thinner.<br /><br />Great price for a classic!
B00JGHMFK6|4|good quality
B00H9MWYWE|5|loved this bra.  Fits great and easy to put on and take off.  very comfortable
B00BWRHUJ4|1|The item description of this item said that it was \\"XL Fit for tall from 180CM-190CM (70\\"-75\\")\\". And I am 6ft tall exactly (182cm / 72\\"), so according to the description provided by the seller this should have fit me perfectly.<br /><br />Instead my legs stick out 3 1/2 inches standing, 4 inches when I sit, and my arms stick out an extra 2 to 2 1/2 inches.<br /><br />So do not purchase unless you are MUCH shorter than the item description says. Otherwise you will waste time like I did waiting for an item that doesn't match the description on the page.<br /><br />Very disappointed in this dishonest seller.
B0009MZVN0|5|I got these about a month ago and I've been running on clouds ever since.  They have held up to multiple washes and they are just as fluffy and comfortable as ever.  If you love to run, you will really love these socks!
B00IE5QZBG|5|i like it, but too small for me. I 'm 5'6 140lbs. I bought size L. I will change size Xl.
B002RTSN6U|3|My girl is skinny so I bought 1 year younger one.  Still too big.  Way too big so I need to buy 2 or 3 years younger one.  She is almost 7.
B0098BPM8M|5|Gorgeous suit as are most Miracle suits. It was too big, so exchanged it for a smaller size. Straps are kind of thin, so I won't be wearing it for water aerobics. But I don't want to ruin it in chlorine anyway.
B00K0DOAN0|5|Fits perfect and is beautiful. It is a two piece so can be worn with other colors underneath.
B0043D1CV6|4|I gave it 4 stars because, I use theses bibs on an open cab tractor with a snow blower, and the seat always ends up having snow on it, as the snow melt , it infiltrate the bib through the crotch seam , so every time I get them off there is a little wet spot inside,nothing major, other than that it is Carhartt quality, totally waterproof, thick material, good quality, just not made to seat your butt in water.
B00N733S24|3|IT'S A REALLY CUTE BLOUSE... SINCE IT RUNS SMALL (I BOUGHT A LARGE.... SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN AN XL), I WILL WEAR IT MORE AS AN UNDERSHIRT TYPE OF SHIRT. IF YOU LIKE FITTED.... THEN MAYBE IT'S NOT TOO BIG.
B002LFMARI|5|Seemed a bit pricey but quality is really good. Our baby with eczema wears this fabric very comfortably. He wears it under a HALO cotton sleep sack and sleeps great!
B008R50VCM|4|Van Heusen fits my athletic shape better than most brands.  They are attractive and comfortable.  The only down fall was, for some reason or another, i couldn't save any money over retail stores on this color.
B003S28N6K|5|As mentioned in previous reviews, fabric feels great, fits very well, tail and ears are adorable.  This outfit is of a good quality and doesn't feel chintzy like many you find in costume stores.
B005J34TXM|5|Soft material, size 2 fits me perfectly / I am 5'4 and 117 p/. As expected it is too long for me, so I had to make them shorter.Size 4 P is too short even if I wear them with flats.Color as expected and as in the picture.
B00551Q5KS|3|Not my favorite bra. It's okay though. Smooth fit under clothes.
B00NC9SRRE|4|These jeans fit me like nothing else. For one thing, not all jeans come in odd sizes, and I am definitely a 33 waist. These jeans fit well in the waist without feeling tight through the hips.<br /><br />These are a little long, but I'll get them hemmed. I just wish it were easier to find these Lucky Brand jeans in a solid dark blue. I'll rip/wear/fade/fray them myself given enough time, thank you. I don't need you to do it for me before I buy them. Still, for bumming around the house on weekends, these are very comfortable.
B00LUNL0N2|5|i am in LOVE with my new wallet!!! its on the bigger size and very well made. the skulls are beautiful!
B00CLEAA08|5|Will have to buy again.
B007U9GSC8|5|Love
B00FAY2UA4|5|I read the other reviews and ordered a 4 even though my daughter normally wears 5 and is moving into a 6.  It fits perfectly and is near ankle length.  Plenty of room not tight at all.  It is a very well made dress and my daughter LOVES it.
B00EI4ID8A|5|Love it
B00B7NZNNI|5|I bought this for my 5 year old, he loves skater clothing and DC happens to be his favorite brand. The sweater was as shown on the picture and the sizes matched up well. It was delivered on the promised date and had no flaws, rips or tears. My son loves his new sweater and is looking forward to wear it this winter.
B001E531CO|5|Was just what my daughter was looking for. Hers was stolen at Christmas and couldn't find replacement.Great price and shipping included.
B00AMYU1CG|5|When I first put on this dress I considered returning it.  I thought it was a bit unflattering. It is a little short (a couple of inches above my knee) and I thought it was not fitted enough through the waist.  Nevertheless, I decided to keep it and I am very happy I did.  I get complements all day from both men and women every time I wear this dress.  I have even had guys I don't know stop to tell me how much they like this dress.  Several people have commented how much they like the colors.  I would definitely recommend this dress to a friend.
B00CPQG39E|5|Gave to my nephew. He loved it so much he took of his Jordan back pack for this one. Plus my nephew is a little scronny and it looks to cute on him.
B003DH0J4O|4|Colors are slightly off but otherwise it fits well and it's long enough. For reference I'm 5'6&#34; and a size 4 or 6. My legs aren't long and it goes about to my knees at the longest point.
B00JSJHQP6|5|Great value and a wonderful product.  Sturdy and easy to use.  I lose these often and will for sure buy another.
B00141A9DW|5|grankid is very pleased
B0015S8BQ6|4|Made of very thin material.  But it does the job.  This cover up pretty much reflects the cost.
B0057NFKGO|4|This is a costume,so I don't hold it  to the same standards as a dress.  However the size said size 14/16 on the package but the top portion would really fit a size 10.  I had a seamstress place inserts in the costume so that I could wear it. The bottom was fine.
B00CDK56T0|5|Gold toe brand great fit and quality.
B00CJ03AK6|3|When I was able to cinch them tight enough, they worked great for a costume. I'm 5'7 with long legs, and they came to the floor. They were very, very baggy on me. I've got a 25&#34; waist and 35&#34; hips, for reference. I could have easily fit two of me in these pants.<br /><br />They don't seem incredibly durable, but for the price, I wasn't expecting much. I probably won't wear them again, anyway.
B005GQZEAE|5|Excellent quality. Exactly as pictured. Will shop here again!
B0018OSOJ6|4|I gave these jeans as a Christmas present to my husband. The dark wash is modern and more formal allowing them to go anywhere just add a suit jacket. The fit is good - at least according to me. I love them on him.
B00BN0NAXK|3|Small
B00UWEFCYI|5|I love the fit if this maxi. I will look for more in other colors.
B000IEFYK4|3|it was scrunched up in a plastic bag and the tulle was ripped. Not what I expected for a special occassion dress. will need to return.
B00J8K70K6|5|My grandson loves them! They are high quality and less $$ than I saw them in a department store.
B00E1LAO1O|5|Cute blouse
B0088EYPEC|5|Tried a anti-scan wallet, found it to be too small and too bulky.  Back to a tri-fold, this one is roomy without being too bulky. Leather is of fine quality, happy with purchase.
B000KJ086M|5|Is a beautiful walkshort, i´am very happy. is one of the best purchases I made, meets the expectations that had
B0042ZWS40|5|Sending back for smaller size but love the quality can't wait to get them back
B000MX92YK|5|It's just great! Most bras don't feel as comfortable as these. Love these bras!!!
B0085TI2VW|5|I got these pants for Christmas, just in time for the coldest part of this very cold winter.  The pants are very tough and very warm.  Excellent for hunting or work.  They are so warm they are uncomfortable at room temperature.
B001OVPRLQ|4|A great product with great shipping. The product does tend to run a little small, but it is great quality, and an absolutely beautiful product! A great seller!!!!
B008O34FTC|2|I've ordered a few pairs of 33x36 Wrangler jeans, and they have fit well, but these were too short in the leg (more like a 34 inch leg) and too narrow in the waist (more like a 32 inch waist). Perhaps they were mislabeled. I returned them.
B003Y3J9LG|5|I HAVE BEEN WAITING TO GET THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND NOW IAM VERY HAPPY I GOTTEN AROUND TO GETTTING THE HAT
B00LBEMRIC|5|Awesome Tshirt!! The fit is amazing, the print is great and the package arrived early! I would totally recommend it!
B00KZIQZRO|5|Give to someone ells
B0018ORF96|5|great pair of jeans
B00DS3USCQ|5|I purchased this sweater for my daughter for the holidays, shes a plus size, and lives out of state, when she recived the sweater it was more than expected, fit was perfect and very soft she adores it thank you.
B007JFEPGY|5|Great shirt for a great band. Durable and doesn't shrink in wash.
B00K1B5FEO|5|My boy loves to wear t-shirts so I really like this shirt because it has some style to it but still comfortable.
B00OTUAA8E|3|The dress is lovely but is too small. I order sizes 12 months. My little girl sizes is 9 months but she can wear some dresses that are sizes 12 months. I put on the dress that is sizes 12 months but the dress is very short for her. I should have got a 18 month size dress for her. This 12 month sizes dress will fit a 6 month old baby.
B005VDR07C|2|I wear a large in all my upper shirts and jackets, this one is very tight across the chest and the sleeves are binding and I cannot move with it on.  I am returning it.
B00IP909EA|1|I don't understand how this is getting close to a 5 star rating.  The material may be black, but its so incredibly thin that you can pretty much see right through it.  You'd have to wear an entirely black jumpsuit underneath so that it would still look black rather than whatever color clothing you are wearing underneath it.  It wasn't exactly an expensive costume, so you get what you pay for, but this certainly could have and should have been made with thicker material.
B005CSODLM|3|This is the type of clothing that if you wash it, it will shink and lose the soft feel, beware.
B00D8423HS|4|Very nice shorts just a little bigger than some 38's
B00FAS40D0|5|Very cute on. Good quality, well made lingerie for the price!
B00JDMXST6|1|i have never ordered clothing from amazon. the fabric of this shirt is very strange. it is bright white but feels like parachute material. under a suit i guess it will be ok but not to the touch. way too much polyesterness. am considering returning. fits fine - collar was tight but thats about the husbands neck - if we got 17 1/2 the rest of it might have been to big. the cuffs are flimsy as others said. poorly sewn with wrinkles in the seam. i would suggest amazon discontinue if they ask. i do a lot of sewing and this isnt broadcloth.
B00GUBHBRS|5|It's fixing to my thighs and cuper cuteeee
B00EHQN9SI|5|The socks are of good quality. They fit great.
B00AJJHDTS|4|I was happy with the quality of the clothing. It made a nice gift. The recipitants were very pleased with the gift.
B00IM3FLVA|2|The top fit as expected but the bottoms are very small. I typically wear a medium and would have felt more comfortable with an XL!
B00567G9UW|4|coat very large, with the sleeves hanging long and the coat hanging low, almost to the ground. the vest doesn't seem like an x-large, more like a large. with some alterations the costume looks good. the bandana was a joke. only half a bandana, but for the money the costume was o.k.
B00YAS6F2U|4|It is cute, but in the picture it looks more like the top is a sweetheart cut and is pretty much just a straight across cut (under the chiffon). The dress is a good length, being 5'9&#34; it was nice that it hit mid thigh.
B009SL5PY8|5|great
B003H8KJCQ|4|i usually get champs tall tees, but i figured i would give these gildan tall tees a try. they are the size they say they are but unlike the other comment these are shorter then the tall tees i have now. not a big deal they are taller then a standard shirt. the fabric is kind of stiff and rough but i have a feeling after a few washes they will feel nice. i would buy more.
B00F4LT2QI|5|My SON loved his custom
B0061Q65BU|5|As in all FRC's, it's very important that you do NOT starch them.  The starch has a chemical reaction with the fire resistive fabric that makes it deteriorate and will actually put holes in the fabric.  If cared for as instructed, this shirt will last a long time.  The fabric is heavy and the snaps look nice.
B004F1KV4A|5|MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVE IT
B00EA6RBSE|5|Love dickies
B00ED38ENU|4|These pants are way comfy!! The colors are vibrant and there was not any bleeding in the wash!!  Will most likely get another pair or two!!
B00B7R9HNQ|5|Just right!
B004TERID0|5|She loves it
B00NTYE7TE|5|My 2-yr niece looks darling in this brand of dress.  The fabrics/colors are all so pretty too.
B00HW7Q53U|5|I have pretty small hands and these fit amazing
B00BFNHOUA|5|fits under dress very nicely she looks hot the corset shows through a little bit but the lines of both  match up evenly so the look great together not interested in the thong but camos go with camos our night is looking hot and naughty we cant wait
B002DYJ2LE|1|NOT A DRESSY BELT AT ALL. IT LOOKS CHEAP AND LIKE A WORK BELT! IT LOOKS SHINY IN THE PICTURE BUT ITS A DULL FINISH. WILL BE RETURNING!
B00EB07VVQ|5|A great coat. Very warm and a classy look. A great color and lining. It was more than I expected. Love it.
B003EUAMEC|5|The Jacket came quick and in perfect condition.  Great Value.  I've never had a jacket before that keeps me as warm.  Especially since it is very light weight.  Plus,  with the special features built in, you can be completely sealed off from snow or cold coming into the jacket.
B004M5IXD0|5|After watching the Seinfeld episode in which Seinfeld bought a suede leather jacket, and wearing it in his living room with his pajama pants, claiming this Jacket made his confident in ANY social situation:-) I did the same with this one, haha.
B00HQ8B3NM|5|Presented this as a gift to a friends baby. They really liked it and complimented the dress. It looked very cute on the baby. If you get it for a discounted price, absolutely a steal.
B003ILBZZC|4|daughter loves these
B00S26TKD2|1|Absolutely too small. I order a size larger than by body. The outfit could not fit a small Chinese woman. Very vey disappointed. I actually throw it in the trash in disgust as this was for a special valentine event. I purchased four outfits for a weekend away with my husband. He was shocked how small the item was. Never again will I purchase from Amazon items such as this. Very disappointed.
B0078WV2RS|5|Great belt fits perfect. Very good quality.
B004R8XA4Y|5|These pants came on the day they said they would, They were packed good and they fit perfectly. Already lining up 2 or 3 more pants from this company .
B00LURANFE|5|High quality all the way down to the packaging. I saw this at Neiman's but Amazon blow that price out of the water.
B00B727XRS|5|Great jeans. Price is just right. Go through the wash and come out perfect. My husband would only wear south pole jeans. I bought these and they last a lot longer then the other brand he was wearing. Perfect jeans
B00AHOQB8O|2|these are cute and would have done the job, but my daughter is long with big feet, the nb and 3 month sleepers do not fit her feet and are too short for her at 2 months
B00IWBM3NG|5|Looks nice and very comfortable. If you between sizes - take biggest size.<br />I order one more. Love these,  love the style. and the pockets
B004DKFWGU|5|Most comfortable scrubs I have ever had. Highly recommend!
B004MNRG1W|5|I have owned this for a few months now. It works well and easy to get the hang of. I would recommend this to other people because of the low price ($11) and I have not had any problems with it. Two slight inconveniences are that the sight doesn't actually line up to what you are aiming at and the quiver easily slides around the barrel. The sight shows where the blowgun is pointing, but the angle from your eye to the sight when the blowgun is held up to your mouth does not show where the dart will actually go, but that is true of any blowgun and once you get the hang of it you won't need a sight. The quiver moving is slightly annoying but for $11 you will get a whole lot of fun. I would recommend buying a pack of darts because you may lose some or may not want to collect them from the target too often.
B003M4ZF1U|2|the hat was to big and i thought the material would be lighter. i send it back. I would not recommend it.
B00B2HBETQ|5|Product very light weight simple to wear and give a lot by adding just a little very well made just a very good product
B00CIJ8AQ2|3|It feels comfy I just got a large and usually they fit me, but occasionally it'll feel a little snug.
B00CIQNOWK|4|Flattering for a sweatshirt. Wide neck and not overly baggy. Already washed it a dozen times and still looks new.
B0036DDUJG|5|I love these pants.  Just ordered my third pair and compared them to the pair I bought about six months ago.  The old ones are about an inch shorter now.  The waist, butt and crotch fit are unchanged.  I like these in particular as my walkaround photography pants; the leg pockets are just big enough and just high enough that whatever I stuff into them doesn't sway and bang around.
B00BRYEA1I|4|Love these great socks. Going to order a few more pairs. Stayed on my foot really well. No sock visible on the top of my foot. Only con is that the logo (Aqua key) is on the back of the ankle. My pants covered it, but I would have preferred the logo to be on the underside of the foot. I pulled up my pant leg in the photo to show location of the logo. Will update after I have washed them a few times.
B00CEWE0Z8|5|Costume looked amazing... really good quality - very high end looking.  It made me feel good to even wear it... something about it just makes you feel good and super hero-ish.  Really great quality and received tons of compliments
B00KJIVDW2|4|It fits perfectly but after a while it becomes uncomfortable. I had 2 apply cushion on the rodes because they hurt my back.
B002TNQBEA|5|I loved the stirt. But don't kisten to the people who say that the shirt runs small because it doesn't.  I bought it in the 3x (against my better judgement) because everyone said they ran small.  When it came in the mail, i was stunned by how big it was.  I was going for super sexy. And in the larger size I had to work it a little differently.  I cut off the strings, added a pair of leging and added a thicker black belt and pair of black wedges and I got good looks and compliments on this top.  the v in the shirt went all the way to my belly button.  Not bad... So I added a black tank top.  All in all the shirt was a huge success, the material probably shouldn't be dryed in the dryer.  I was purchase more in more colors and I will purchase from this seller.  I was absolutely happy with my purchase!!
B00R7KU718|5|i really like it
B0053Z1WQI|4|A little on the small side, but I love it
B00K5NPK5C|3|The fit is good, the quality of the actual fabric is nice and stretchy. I'm disappointed with the decals of the skeleton bones though. When I opened the package and felt it I knew the decals weren't going to last very long and sure enough, after one wear and one wash, small bits from the back were peeling and continue too. It will still be a cool pair of leggings after the decal is completely off, but I'm a bit upset it's not as permanent as I thought it might be.
B00I9W1YQ0|4|Being fashionable while pregnant is a must. I just might wear it after pregnancy :)
B00NBHAXF6|5|Something comfortable i can wear and still tease that i have the power.
B00IZ83YHA|2|Cheap fabric. Same fabric used for like Halloween customs.
B00EI8GGIA|4|It's ok one. If it's add a little long length should be much better. I will keep and wear it, it's not my favorite but OK to wear out and nothing wrong with it.
B004QF0TI8|5|Bought these for my husband and he really likes them. Keeps his feet warm when he is out in the cold.
B00NL1E5I8|5|I love this dress! I got so many compliments , I will check in other colors beautiful dress
B00O3O4S02|3|They feel nice, soft, stretchy...but they are tight in the calf
B000MXB1ZS|1|These Bali bras from BareNecessities smelled like tire rubber & tar. I washed them in Gain hot water 3 times & 3 Febreeze treatments & they sat in the sun for a day. Next 2 rounds of Bath&Body works & finally ok. Amazon service is always good & all Bali products used to be great. Tell Bali to not use rubber
B0076QJ4P8|5|I bought this dress for a dinner party and it's great. I was skeptical that it would be true to size, but it fit great. Beautiful detail and classic look.
B00QEUL80Q|5|I love this dress!  I ordered a small and I'm 5'7&#34; 140 pounds bra size A34.  It fits beautifully!! The dress is made so well too.  The dress is also made to stretch a little.  I think a small would fit up to 5'8&#34; 150 pounds and a much bigger chest size!  Very happy with this dress.
B00Y16P3X8|5|Top cut small, bottoms cut LARGE, had to return.  Seemed well made though.
B00JC4BKK4|5|great quality and style. nice but not to flashy. plenty of compartments and big enough for the size of my bank cards. I paid less than 14$ however I'd pay 3 times that price easily. Ted Baker makes everything with the utmost attention detail.
B000M57GV4|5|This suit is of very high quality and I'm very pleased with my purchase. It arrived the very next day by overnight express! I highly recommend this vendor!
B002S52LXY|5|The product is well made and the fabric is so soft -great for little ones. Also love the choice of imprints. Great to have positive choices.
B007O1WS9Y|4|As someone with fairly large shoulders, the top of the costume did not fit particularly well.
B00AJ1APAU|5|The softest,most comfortable leggings/tights. Excellent fit and quality. Can't wait to get more. Color is vibrant and true. Great for larger than average size individuals. Item arrived within the estimated delivery time-frame.
B00EOA8SWO|1|cheap fabric - like bad sheets
B003ICF8LI|5|came perfect all the way
B009WNWAI6|5|Great
B00OX8Y592|5|Bought these for sleeping. I'm a 34DDD and the size 38 fits me with a little room. Very comfortable. Good quality.
B00H4MFQ3I|4|Good quality, cute, holds up after washing
B007NDSDO2|5|Perfectly Elegant And Extremely High Quality...
B00AG3XCCE|4|Very comfortable
B00A13D6V6|5|One of my favorite purchases!! This is so cute with leggings and boots.  I bought the red one and love it just as much!! Fast delivery, perfect!
B00FRD77DS|1|Missing a rhinestone - I ordered this for Christmas, so no time to return it - shipping took FOREVER!!!!
B005F47VA8|5|This was a Christmas present for my boyfriend who's nickname is &#34;Wile E&#34;, he'll look very cool wearing this when we take the Harley out for a put. He loved it! Delivery was ahead of the scheduled date, everythig was perfect!
B00JO5P6TW|1|This was terrible -- it was a HUGE pair of men's black underwear.  Horrible.
B00NW9QLMW|5|Love these pants! So comfortable and warm in this brutal North Dakota cold! Highly recommend!
B00FODHLF0|5|Just what I wanted!
B00JYSE9JM|5|It fits perfectly!
B00HNO2DHE|4|Dockers sometimes run small, but these fit great.  Length is a little long but after wah they probably be perfect.
B00FOGGD38|5|I love this brand. My daughter loves the material and how light weight it is. The fit was perfect on her. She wears a girls 12-14 and this was just perfect. I never dry my kids shirts so this will last for a long time.
B000LU7W5K|1|I thought this bra was going to be perfect but it sucked! It runs small so I couldn't wear it and I didn't bother to send it back because I'm overseas.
B003DHSE8W|5|Purchased as a birthday gift for a co-worker and was very well recieved. Quality was excellent and had a varied color choice.
B00WQWCG2A|3|The generic size was a bit too snug for me, 5'7.5 @ 150lbs, but wearable.
B00IOWNMOM|5|I have been looking for these socks everywhere! I bought some a few years ago from shoe carnival and they stopped carrying them.  They are so comfortable! My feet don't feel sweaty in them!
B00E4ZU73M|3|This cape was okay but it was too thin.  It would not keep my arms warm in church.  It would be handy to have the pockets but unfortunately I had to return it.
B00MV2TOFC|5|Cute and fit perfect for toddler. Doesn't shrink with washing but just a little with drying. Toddler loves the graphics on the pjs!
B00NJU874E|5|Perfect hoodie for a little Star Wars fan.  I am impressed by the quality and detail of this product.  The body of the hoodie is very soft. I also love that it will not need ironed. This quickly became my son's favorite thing to wear.<br />The size is what I expected.  My son is a 7 normally. The hoodie was listed at an 8.  It fits very well with some room to grow for longer use.<br />The price is a little steep but worth every penny. I would definitely recommend buying.
B00NIPUMLG|5|My daughter just loves it
B00IX0K40U|4|The day2night sunglass is good..
B00EM2J9ZO|3|I find it is a little bit large, but it is okay. It is difficult to find the right size.
B0010AZ0FE|2|Got these and was really excited, good underwear ranks high on my list of clothing items. But I have to say, they fall far short of what I've come to expect from Jockey. They fit too loosely, the elastic at the thighs is just too loose...and it's not my thighs, trust me!  The materiel does not feel like cotton, it feels like a mix of materiel's, nothing like the Jockey midway briefs I wear. No, these are truly a departure from the norm. They don't even have the Jockey Logo on the front as in the image!!!  Could these be knock-offs?
B00IPKPC4G|5|Boxer? Brief? Why not the best of both? Great fit under skinny jeans. Good underwear is the foundation for a good day.
B007WAG03C|4|This is a very cute shirt! I wear it all the time and get compliments! It fits a little tight at the bottoms but other than that it is fabulous!
B00HPLTH10|3|The tie was perfect as my boyfriend loved it, but the shirt that I ordered in his normal size was very large on him and he almost refuses to wear it.
B00KRYPMNO|5|Vivid green color and great price!  This was a great deal.
B008B803J6|4|My daughter loves this outfit. We wore the shirt to the Man of Steel showing.
B003DA5YRI|4|These are nice socks for the price.  They are the only socks I have found that stay up.  The only downfall is the tops start to come undone.
B000FGU8OC|4|This hat is well made, provides shade, and will be coming with me to country concerts!  I'm looking forward to wearing it.
B004RHMEX8|5|So far so good.. no problems with it..
B00C0PIRCQ|2|This seller is from Hong Kong and you get to pay for the shipping back if it doesn't fit. I normally wear a small bottom with victorias secret. These felt smaller
B00QNZWP04|4|I was very relieved to find t-shirts with the more simple logo
B0058LXNQY|5|This bra is a perfect fit. I love the feel and the fullness, the straps are sturdy, and I'm not falling out of the bra.
B0002OQ87I|4|I have been looking for lounge pants for weeks and finally found a pair that fit my price range.  The shipping was fast and my husband says they are really comfy!
B00B2OL7C8|4|The other ones I have, which I bought at DSW have tacky heels to prevent slipping.  But these stay on pretty well.
B00BSE0I72|1|Quality does not feel good. The camisole is not as described. It fits really awkward and definitely not sized correctly.
B00KYWDIH6|1|Didn't like it at all. Too big and the pockets make the overall cumbersome especially when one wants to wear boots. The outfit was bought to prevent insect bites when working in the organic garden but it's way too uncomfortable to do any gardening. Luckily I found another one much nicer, white (white repels insects) and extremely comfortable.
B00CKYHBRO|3|I got these socks as a gift for my friend & she said the socks were too tight on her calves.
B00DSE1FWM|5|Show your support for men and women on the police force.
B00HAV6L9Q|3|For the price and quality, this isn't bad. It does what I bought it to do (to wear as a body slip for my whit beachy dress) and it's comfortable. The material is thin, though so be aware of that. And the snap at the crotch works well and hasn't been any trouble for me. Overall, not bad! Only wish it was thicker material.
B005Z44QS8|5|He wanted a lighter robe to take to Florida. This one is really nice. Nice material. Nice weight. Very happy with it.
B00EAHHPB6|4|Fits as expected, somewhat scratchy material. Comfortable straps.
B00A4LCHYC|5|great
B00D8UYS84|2|For some reason this top is very uncomfortable! The fit is fine(a little large) but the material is very scratchy and has irritated my skin.I believe its the dye in the fabric which seems to bleed. unfortunately I will be returning this item.
B0087QCBE2|5|Length is perfect for the new maxi dresses. Will get lots of use out of this one as I have several longer dresses.
B009L52JGI|2|The skirt color was rust not chocolat brown as ordered, also the fabric was super crinkle not smooth as represented in photo;
B000O8MEG6|4|This item is as advertized. size is a tad small depending on what you expect to use it for. The black one is shiny and thus not really unisex. It is well made and should stand up ok to moderate use.
B00JBXOUJ4|5|GOOD
B00KVE126Q|2|The legging are really cute but they are definitely not true to size, I wear a 2x and got a 3x but fit and look like a 1x
B00828Q2KY|4|Cute, but not as stout as I'd like. I need to add twelve more words to my review which I think is crap.
B00OYWYB7I|5|Perfect for Miami!
B00JSD7396|4|Bought as gift for wife, she likes it.
B008X9LSW4|5|Perfect fit.
B00DULVCF8|2|So I like the feel of these. They aren't too long, which is an issue I have with a lot of yoga pants. I hate it when they drag 4 inches behind me.  The medium was labeled small/medium, not the medium I selected. It's really tight and it seems like the seat is a bit see-through, which is kind of embarrassing. These may become relegated to lounge pants or &#34;remember to wear a thong with these&#34; pants if I wear them out. They are super cute, though, and will make your butt look great.  9/18/15 update: Since ordering these a year ago they seem to have shrunk a bit, even though I never put them in the dryer (only line/flat drying). The legs are shorter and look more like straight leg pants than the flares they originally were. The waist tighter and now gives me muffin top when I wear it with the waist rolled down. My measurements/weight have stayed the same since I purchased these.  Very disappointed in these deteriorating so quickly in just over a year. If I'd known they'd shrink so much I never would have purchased them.
B007ZQHYPG|4|The blouse was made in an excellent material, no loose threads at all. The color was far more beautiful than I thought and the best was that it is really a plus size !
B0058VFW8Q|5|I love it......
B00553XOGO|5|This is a great sports bra.  I recently spent several hours at national retail sports stores trying on sports bras and none of them fit as well or were as comfortable as this one.  After 2 hours on the court, still very happy with the fit and comfort.
B00TJ1T6TC|5|I love these tanks!  I have three of them.  They are perfect for post race or workout (I am a triathlete), as well as dressing them up and wearing them out.  They are quite durable, I've washed them plenty of times and the stitching is holding.  Soft cotton, comfortable.  An absolute must have.
B0051NTHJG|5|This has been really helpful as my belly gets bigger.  I can still wear a lot of shirts I wore before I was pregnant :)
B00H464US6|4|I liked the style and very and it is so comfortable
B00IV4C6Y0|5|thanks. I like it.
B00LANVVAY|1|different as a picture
B003QVKKPK|4|Love Carthart, but was not a fan of the vest. XXL was too big, but it felt too short for me. I'm 5'9 210 and the vest fit right above my belt line. I'm pretty sure that how it suppose to fit,  this is my first vest. I guess I expected  a different fit. I personally didn't feel comfortable wearing it. I kept trying to pull down the vest so that it felt a liitle longer. This was my own expirence with this vest. The quality of the vest itself is excellent.
B009YKEU2Q|2|Didn't even got a chance to wear them, they are too small. I am a L/XL, but I read the reviews and decided to go for a XL/XXL, because another person wrote they were smaller. But OMG! They are WAAAAAYYYYY SMALLER!!!!!
B00JLDWB22|3|I love the look, but size small is definitely for someone who weighs atleast 115 pounds and is atleast 5 ft, 4''.  The top fits good, but its a little loose in the hip/midsection.
B001J7HKCY|5|Very cute, nice fabric
B00HXRUMDI|4|Very cute and my 3 year old loves them.  I rated down 1 star because I had 2 pair fray a bit after washing.
B00DUEJGVM|5|Although I did not keep this dress, it was a very nice dress for the price.  I ordered three styles and kept another one.
B000K3IZGI|4|These Slappa Hardbody 90 DVD holders are decently built, certainly more sturdy than the types available at retail stores.  My only gripe is that the interior sleeves should be at least another inch away from the binding, as I've found it much more difficult to place a DVD and its artwork in those sleeves.  If you have a ton of DVDs, these cases work well.  I do believe, however, that Slappa 70 DVD boxes work even better, and look more natural placed in an entertainment center or bookshelf.
B00KRUXCDA|5|I use this jacket for a warm up for workouts.  It is super cute with the little gold hearts hanging from the ties and zipper.  I like the cuff cut outs also.  I ordered an extra small and it is a slightly big so it fits true to size for me.
B005G5XFGA|5|Arrived on time, packaged very well. Light weight lined, plenty of room for heavy shirt if you look to shed your outer wear,(If you get too warm), very tough material, well made Great price!<br /><br />Love it.<br />Might get another...
B0018OOCM4|5|Levi jeans are the best.
B00AREHZO8|5|I have narrow shoulders and have a hard time finding shirts that fit me well, this one fits me well and doesnt explemplify my narrow shoulders, it makes them look normal size, and I like that.
B00QR7VAT0|2|Way to small, I am a U.S. size medium this fit like an extra small and the hood was not as big as I was hoping defiantly need to be petite if you want to fit into this or have it look even relatively big. Length in arms and torso were both to short
B00BHP22I0|5|cute
B00EAYHFFU|5|this is so much nicer than I expected. The fabric is fabulous. The fit was fine. The sleeves add a little something extra to the dress. Will get much enjoyment out of it for sure!
B007Y6VV1K|5|Great Shirt.  The spaghetti strap one is great w/ a black lace overlay; those that know Curly will see it.  Those that don't just see a design.
B00Q08QT1A|2|Fit not that great
B003BWT316|5|I bought this as a Christmas present for my father.  It is a good quality t-shirt and the design is awesome!!  My father should love it!!!
B00HH3BVO2|3|Very nice and love the style
B00YAYJJP4|5|Loved this dress! Thought I would have to hem the dress since I am 5ft tall but it fit perfectly.
B008KLCCJ8|3|Ripped easy
B000WVEA7G|5|I think this maybe the best item I have found for people that hate to carry a billfold filled with junk I can  carry even cash if I needed I just think this is a great item for a man it is made well, leather  made and for the cost a great gift for anyone
B00E68Z8IG|5|Only scrub maternity pants that I feel cute in! No saggy butt. It's a good fit.
B007ZYVFWG|5|I just received this blouse and can't say enough about it! I'm very top heavy, and this blouse does a great job being very attractive AND not over exaggerating it. It covers any tummy you don't want to advertise. Cool, Summery and very feminine.<br />I'll be looking for another one!
B00LCWCLOS|5|I love it!
B000N3V878|1|way too large!
B00CA6IGPI|4|The colors and print are perfect, however I'm still trying to figure out how to wear it. It's a little too bulky for me to wrap or tie around my neck, and not quite heavy enough to wear as a shawl.
B001IYFKFW|3|The fit is fine... it is more on the white side, not really blonde.<br />It is cheap, so strands fall out - but for the price, overall, it is decent.
B004HCYGV6|5|Ordered as a gift for groomsmen for my sons wedding!  Nice, heavyweight, beautiful coloring.  Was a HUGE hit with the groomsmen.  Arrived quickly!  Would definately order again
B00BQG8G62|3|Looks pretty nice, the quality is not great but it's perfect for those occasions.
B00DSN2518|4|My daughter adores this t-shirt, as I knew she would. Hey, it's SpongeBob, what do you expect? In any case, I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 just because the image on the shirt seems to be some sort of heat transfer, and is wearing down a little faster than I might like. Not too bad, though. I've seen much worse in t-shirts where the image peels off after a couple of washes. This one's a fair bit more durable than that.<br /><br />Oh yeah, one more thing: sure it's a &#34;boys&#34; T-Shirt but, come on... it's a T-Shirt. Don't think twice about buying one for your spongebob loving daughter. Neither she nor anyone else will know that it's not a &#34;girls&#34; t-shirt.
B005TX3CDA|5|Love everything
B00CDJ9IIG|3|The dress looks full and lovely in the picture, but isn't long like the picture shows, and it doesn't even have a hem.  I think you get what you pay for, but if it is actually an expensive dress, but marked down, I think it is poorly made.
B00BIXUK2G|5|This is a great looking shirt.  It arrived in a very impressive time and was packaged very well.  I received compliments on the shirt even before wearing it.  It does run a little small so I ordered one size bigger and it fits perfectly.  Highly recommended.
B00JX2AP56|3|They are not made the samesize a couple pair are real tight most are good fit
B00JYB3H1K|4|The color is much brighter than depicted - definitely a bold, hot pink. It has a nice cut and seems like it will look good under a suit. However, the fit also runs a little small so there is no wiggle room. If you don't get the perfect size or the Jones New York dimensions don't fit your body well, it may not work for you. I am a ladies size 12-14 usually so ordered a large as per the chart but it was a little too small in the waist. Maybe it's meant to be skin tight in the waist but I don't like that look. However, I like it enough that I'll hold on to it until I lose some weight.
B00Q5IWDQU|5|They fit perfectly! They are the most comfortable jeans I own.
B00AF40Q32|2|The print is really nice, however, the fit is really strange. I guess these are meant for people who are built straight up and down. They are too tight in my hips, but in the waist they are like 1-2 inches too big, so the waistband sticks out awkwardly in the back. If you are curvy, I don't recommend.
B0035DY0AA|5|This was a gift for my son, but he loves the shirt.
B0010Z523E|5|I love this tee.  I got it for my husband, but when I saw how nice it was I never told him that it for him.  I wear it all the time, it's very comfortable.  The quality of the shirt is also nice.
B003E1ROZQ|5|This hat is great. Keeps the sun completely off my face so that I don't have to put sunscreen on every time I go outside which is at least twice a day, to work in the garden. The string underneath the chin keeps my hat in place on those windy days which we have a lot where I live.
B00Q5KZ2AW|3|Not for me but not as expected. Wish they made the photos in the nba socks or with enough cushion for ball players. However I think my nephew will enjoy having is favorite nba player socks
B00GLJA036|3|Hubby got size medium bc of what the review said. Way too baggy. Not a slim fit. Stick to your normal size guys!!!
B009LWMX3A|5|I used this for an Amelia Earhart costume, and I love it. Got a ton of compliments and I recommend it!
B000TFKN4E|5|it is taking way to long for this order to go through . i ordered a piece of clothing the same day i did this piece and i already riecived that piece and been charged for it aswell. dont know why its taking so long for this order to go through .
B00EIQRR62|2|does not fit like pictures, comes much higher on the waist
B00D9SB5IQ|5|exactly as described
B008J42R32|3|im 5\\"2' 108 lb with a bit of a booty but a small feels a bit too loose. other than that I feel like they are ok?
B00CIPJSZ8|5|I have worn Pendleton sweaters, vests & shirts for over 20 years. I have had a couple variations of this vest.  The contrasting colors in the weave(marled) is a favorite, lots of positive comments. Fit is spot on & Amazon pricing & delivery made 4 shirts, 2 sweaters & this vest a great investment.  I will be back in about  10 years if I can keep the moths & my bride's propensity to shrink her faves away.Quality goods & Amazon, perfect.
B001MXM912|1|BE AWARE!  This is a junior's t-shirt.  I emailed the vender and asked if it was a men's shirt and was assured it was in the responce.  I ordered it and discovered it was a junior's size.  I informed the vender of the mistake but they still did not admit they misinformed me.  They still claimed it was a men's shirt, but the shirt \\"is slim fitted and designed to be snug.\\"  I own several other Junk Food shirts and know how they are sized--this one is literally half the size of my other shirts.  DO NOT buy unless you are purchasing for a child or very small person.
B0051U15VW|5|comfortable, good elasticity, snug fit
B009RT6MMU|3|Bought it because I lIke the saying.  Conversation piece.  Only problem, t-shirt material too thin.  Would recommend with the advice that material is thin.
B009O2IMVE|5|This sweatshirt ran small but my granddaughter loved it so reordered it in a larger size. It was her favorite XMas gift from me
B000SKLTI4|5|These socks have held up great!
B00CQR9R8Q|4|The cap came quickly and fits great after some adjustment with the side straps. Not the highest quality cap I have but for the cost quite nice.
B0072LBQVM|4|Don't believe all the reviews you read about this product.  I was reluctant to buy it after reading them, because they said it was different than it should look, and it was too small.  Not true.  It fit me perfectly (I'm very skinny though), and as far as it being ribbed.  It is ribbed.  But micro ribbed.  Still good quality, and if you look at the pictures, you can clearly see that it is ribbed, I don't know what some people are complaining about.  Great buy if you can fit it.  It is one size fits \\"few\\", but it stretches.  I love it!  I'm going to get one in every color.
B00LFIA89Y|4|Perfect I like it
B00CH5HG30|5|great
B00V3CKE9G|5|I am 5' 4&#34; 118 and I bought the small even though I usually buy the XS. It fits perfectly and its very well made, I will buy it again should it come in another coloe
B00341G77W|5|Purchased this as a gift for a relative.  It was something they needed.  They loved it.  the leather will last a long time.
B00J9WVDCY|4|Nice shirt not true to fit.  Would have loved to have it in a women's shirt but had to go with a mens.
B00D8SS6BG|5|This was a gift for my husband, and he is quite pleased with it.  Says it's comfortable and warm.  Doesn't even mind the tag on one side (I do!  But he's the one wearing it, so... :)
B00CWXR934|5|so soft, warm
B00F65ORHQ|2|too small
B001C3UHGG|5|The color really makes it stand out and  the solid construction and good price makes it a very good deal.     I definitely recommend this item.
B00HB1P1VY|5|This shirt is well made and the cut of the shirt is perfect and lays well on my son. The waist is just the right width unlike some shirts that are loose and sloppy looking. After receiving it i went back to purchase it in every size that my boys will grow into, also if it was available in more colors i would buy them all!
B000TFY8N6|3|When I purchased these, I thought the description &#34;fits size 12 to 14&#34; meant that all six pairs of socks would fit my size 13 foot.  Unfortunately, the sizes were not consistent. Some fit perfectly while others are so large that the heel is exposed above my shoe.  I think the largest ones would probably fit a size 15 foot.  I bought 2 6 packs of socks and him able to use nine of the pairs.
B00KOF6960|4|good
B002YUGRIS|5|This jacket is light weight and warm, It is perfect fro spring time and fall. It firs great and the price point is perfect.
B002YK3GSC|5|This is a great suit for a large busted woman.  Pay close attention to the sizing information and go with the largest size on YOUR body.  Though the rest of my body is a 10 I ordered a size 12 according to my bust size on the chart.  The suit fits great and if I had gone with the 10 I am afraid I would have been falling out the top.  So read the chart and measure before buying.  Plus the top is a nice lenght.  I am long wasted and a lot of tops come too short on me.  This one has great lenght to it and does not fly up when the boat is going down the water.  I really like this suit.  It gives enough support to wear it comfortably all day.
B00ARAUUCG|4|Would have been 5 stars if better priced
B00B7GHKSQ|4|Nice quality... very thick hat... a bit on the expensive side. We Bought this as a gift.  But, Would buy another.
B009YD6NIW|5|Lovely gown. Nice light weight. Generous size and and the length was perfect for me. I thought I might have to shorten it as I'm 5 ft 2 inches but its a good length.
B00KU2COJ8|2|TOO CLEAR
B00DQYXDWO|5|This jacket had all of the &#34;requirements&#34;...
B003ILIWD0|1|I wear size Small. But sometimes, just to make sure I order Medium. THis was the case. And the medium size was deep in my skin :( I have no time to return this product. But if I would know I would probably order Large?
B0007CKN6C|5|These jeans fit right, not too tight in the crotch. The belt loops are not wide enough for a wide belt but are ok for a regular width belt.
B001HRLIRY|3|It was nice quality, but I would order a size up. The size was too small. It appears to be of good quality and is very appealing. The product arrived on time.
B00FP87Z3W|5|I'm 5'3, weight: 150 pounds, and with a 36D size, this dress fits perfectly. So happy with it.
B00DV3V6LA|5|My daughter loves this for her volleyball practices
B00O9UZMD2|5|Beautiful socks
B00M3RJNR4|4|Hat js cute but am afraid  it will come off because it fits loosely.
B008P7YRNG|4|I love this shirt. I have received tons of compliments. It may not be the best quality but the look is very stylish. What more can you expect for the price!
B00M3ZJVI2|5|Great, comfortable no real seam to show through clothes. Arrived quickly
B00D95J1GW|5|Awesome
B00CXY57HM|5|EXCELENTE
B00KZ0CKYY|5|Great deal, great product, and fast shipping.
B00BDG6QBM|4|Provides winter warmth with heavy flannel like material,and it's a good looking shirt and I like the slate blue color.
B003IBV3RW|4|First off I am 6' 205lb and the M/L fit PERFECT. It fits snugly over the shoulders and doesn't pinch or bunch anywhere. For the price I was surprised at the quality of the material however I did notice the stitching was a little weak on a few seams but it isn't an issue. The patches are sewn on great and after a few nights of partying they held up. The glasses look great and I would highly recommend finding a set of dog tags on here to go with it. This is definitely a popular costume but one really cool thing was that the costume comes with both Maverick and Goose name patches that velcro on and I found a guy wearing Goose at a party and we had a broment. Highly recommend this product.
B004AS3TJM|5|Lots of room and pretty decent quality.
B008ESD5L6|5|My son is disabled and it is really hard to find slippers that fit his feet.<br />So I bought this pair and he loves them, they fit and I love them. I<br />even bought another pain, black ones.. we don't mind the pink on the edge..
B00EKE4MOC|5|I bought this to surprise my husband for his 50th birthday party which was a western theme. He loved it and it was very comfortable to wear all night.
B00FZK9LK0|5|I bought this shirt for my dad for Father's Day and he loves it and wears it all the time. It always looks good and is comfortable/casual. Never needs ironing. Next year I'm going to get him the blue one!
B00F9YA8TA|5|Expensive and yet good value for an authentic and beautiful Donegal tweed coat. Bought this for my wife after extensive research, and couldn't be happier.<br /><br />Compared to US brands this Irish brand's sizes run a bit smaller, so I would strongly recommend using the sizing info on the Magee website. I picked one size larger and the fit was just right for my wife.<br /><br />Well packaged and very quick delivery (ordered Thursday evening and received first thing on Monday).
B00015GEB8|4|Nice quality leather lined bag!   but....a little too large and heavy for what I was looking for.   I should have checked the dimensions a little more closely before purchase.
B000U87BKO|5|Adorable!
B004NIIKB6|5|Size was a concern, but it fit around my adult son's big 'old head.<br />I was able to wear it, too. Product arrived when and as expected.
B00HDA3NWC|5|fine
B00XY318TM|4|I love the look of this dress on the hanger and on me. The fabric has great stretch which makes it extremely forgiving. The length is perfect for the style. I am 5'4 and it hits me above my knee. I will say that the size of this dress is about two sizes off. I normally wear an American large or extra large depending on the style. For a slim fitting dress like this I tend to wear an extra large for personal preference. I don't want to look like a sausage. LOL Anyway, the extra large in this dress fits me like a large. Yet again, it has such great stretch that I am not exactly sure of the size difference. Do go up at least one size if you are a fit person. If you are voluptuous are and extremely curvy woman, myself, go two sizes up for comfort!
B00BXAJ5VQ|1|I loved this bra, until the strap snapped after two weeks. For how expensive it is.. I was expecting higher quality
B00CJQ2E16|2|Good price but the XL was really tight, and I usually wear a large.  I gave it to someone who wears a medium, and it fit fine.
B00B0BVDCC|5|This slim wristlet is just all I need for my credit cards, DL, and android cell phone.  Convenient when I don't want to carry my handbag into a store shopping.
B00D129096|1|I received this blouse and could not even close the top, much less button it, even though I ordered my normal size. It's made in China and the sizing is way, way off. Don't buy this unless you order at least 2 sizes larger than you normally would.
B001CM9CZO|5|Fit good and was comfy
B00LMN9NXE|5|Luv this cincher...would recommend it to anyone... Be sure to measure yourself, Dont guess..u will most likely get the wrong size if you guess..i wear it under my clothes and it  fits comfortable.. I can go about my day with it on....
B0084C1GX6|5|Modest yet funky enough for my teenage daughter.  Doesn't show dirt/food stains.  Only mildly scratchy compared to most prefab Halloween costumes.
B009ZUKBCS|4|I am always getting compliments from co-workers when I wear these. They are very comfortable and light. Easy to just wipe clean.
B00KXW1UMC|5|I bought a medium. It's 100% cotton I believe so it will shrink a bit. I love the shirt! The message is hilarious. I would go up one size because its all cotton.
B0088EYPEC|5|Wow. Amazing quality, super price. Would pay twice as much for this if I had to. Everything a good wallet should be.
B002G9UEHC|5|Took a chance with the first one last winter. Served its purpose so well that i bought a second one for this winter just in case I misplace the first one.  Looks and works very well for casual wear also.
B00AXLCFAY|5|Perfect fit for my lean four year old.
B005ZMMTKW|5|I bought this in both colors... I really like em' both. I personally like the grey one more because you can see all the details. One part though I have a bigger back since I workout a lot and I have a bigger chest so make sure you measure your body before ordering...I am 6 feet 175 lbs and I have XL size (US L) it's really tight on top due to having a bigger and wider chest. Also it has buttons inside the vest so one can be more stylish and wear it in different ways...the buttons are directly behind the ones in front.
B00P20ZZTY|5|Beautiful pajamas son looks adorable in them. 👼
B00I052QJU|5|Fits wonderfully. Very good material. It's expensive but lasts forever - unlike the Lee's I used to buy.
B000IBECL4|5|Received as advertised.
B009A722M8|4|She really adores these types of clothes and the fit makes it extra special for her.  Your sizes are what they say they are not bigger or smaller
B00910V62Q|5|Got it today, and went outside wearing the PJS, and got all the love and praise from it. xD<br />I got it a little late, but it's alright because it really came out great.
B001MDHG8S|5|Fits well & love the color...very fast shipping...good quality...washes & dries well...doesn't seem to shrink...my husband loves it & wears it often.
B004XG4TCC|5|Great product. Shipped and arrived on time for Christmas.  Exactly as described. Recommend this vendor.  Very good fit and it looks good when worn.
B00FXPT37S|5|I purchased this same sweatshirt about 12 years ago in black, and it is still my favorite. The black has faded over the years, but it has always been the most comfortable sweatshirt I've owned. It is very warm, I've warn this outside when temperatures were 19 degrees and I was plenty warm. This is the best sweatshirt ever created, I will continue purchasing this sweatshirt as long as Carhartt continues to make them.
B00NONCZXA|2|Ears are off one larger than the other and looks like it's for a child
B00MXZ788W|3|Purchased for boy's to wear at a &#34;Tinkerbelle&#34; birthday party - these worked out well for the money.  I would have given these a -Star rating if the feather would have stayed in better.
B000R4Y7YO|4|A solid belt, but a bit thicker than older Nautica models. I don't think this one will ever break from wear and tear unlike my prior belt.
B004XVJLYS|5|My grandson like it very much.
B005M9J79E|1|I returned the item
B007KF1U98|5|Love these
B004Q9T8W2|5|Great deal
B00OMM5YGC|5|Got this for my friend's sister, who lives in another country.  She was so thrilled, because it was just perfect for her.  It filled in on the sides, as she had had a complete masectomy on just one side.  She was not a large breasted woman, but quite tall, so I was told.  Searched internet for hours to find this.
B00JO9ZVWU|5|Great Price, super cute, and super fun. Came a bit quicker than expected, considering that some people noted it took them a month or so. Came in for me in about 1.5 weeks.
B0033UVILO|4|I bought this dress (for a lot more money, I might add) in fuschia from Lord & Taylor.  It fits great.  It is a very thick material -- it feels heavy on the hanger -- and the stretch is very flattering.  It sucks you a little in without feeling (or looking) too tight.  I bought another style from the same designer for a wedding two years ago and loved it -- it was the same stretch satin material.  It was comfortable for a night of dancing and did not wrinkle at all.
B00O6RQ9BM|3|Sweater is ok.  I have no issue with sizing...fit is pretty much like the picture { I am 5'4&#34; and 120lbs}.  The problem is this very odd, chemical odor.  It came in plastic wrap and I have been airing it out for the past three days to no avail.  It's like kerosene or something.  Will need to dry clean.
B0019CJWVQ|5|This was the most awesome costume ever..I dressed it up a bit and everyone loved it.
B003BVJ3PS|3|It fit me fine, it was just very stretchy.
B00BEEKXYO|5|Normally I wear a size 10 but they were a tad too snug so I returned them and ordered a size 12.  I love them.
B00EDTMPNY|1|Not a good fit. I thought they were a certain brand of jeans. Turned out not be the brand I requested
B00OX6N716|5|These shorts are high quality, look great and are made of a breathable tough material. The shorts are a little stretchy and give you full mobility. They aren't too long and fit right above my knee. There is a draw string inside the waist but you don't have to use it as there is a strong velcro closure. I use these for jiu jitsu and the gym.
B00H48NDWS|5|This dress is the perfect dark royal blue I was looking for. I was nervous since the dress was so cheap and the image looked a little purple. However, this dress is made extremely well. The beads are sturdy and gorgeous. The length is perfect and the material is thick. I didn't know there was a zipper on the side and since it is on the side, it kind of pops out at times but it isn't bad. The back is plain compared to the front but I don't mind at all. I am so happy I found my perfect prom dress for so cheap!
B00BTZN8H2|5|Love this jacket....
B00KLRDG80|4|Got a size larger then normal and it fits well
B000XA8V0S|1|Dry rotted. Peeling apart. Waste of money.
B00DQYPCPA|3|I guess that's just their opinion but still maybe if it had been designed differently it wouldnt be so...douchey looking?
B00B1ACD5S|4|This is a great coat.  My husband was looking for something high vis for work and it does the job.
B00QRWV52C|5|Very pretty and light weight.
B002HTVVP0|4|I am a size 8 and the elastic was tight around the waist. It's cute and super short if that's what you are looking for.
B00BPC01M4|5|Fit great and gave this new mommy a confidence boost
B000VK9VTK|5|Love this style and the way it fits and need more.  Thank you  Should not have to write a long paragraph to say what I need to say
B00J7K7QFG|5|I got this shirt today and I am so happy with the results. My shirt had a normal odor and if you look closely, you can see tiny black bleed onto the white but it is not a problem. It only took about 3 days to ship, I love this shirt.
B000WN5JRE|5|Purchased as a backup for wedding hair.  Ended up not using but it looked wonderful when it arrived.  Would recommend again
B004UPUFGA|5|fit a little big but my son is small for his age loved this costume... The costume itself was great quality and very warm! We got tons of compliments on it, definitely will be  buying more from this company.
B00JYALCC2|5|Excelente
B009PJV6KK|1|This mask is impossible to wear because it smells so strongly of spray paint. I returned it immediately. It made my entire house smell absolutely horrible. Do not purchase this product, as the fumes make it dangerous.
B002QWEGBE|5|Item received as expected.
B00Q45AIWU|5|Great shorts with just the right amount of stretch!
B007VSDIEY|4|Great Belt and I can get through airport checks without taking it off.
B00IDAYV8G|3|The material is kind of thin but not see through. A foundation garment will make the fit better
B001O9BEKG|5|The underwear was soft and comfortable.  The quality seems to be okay.  I will find out after I wash them a few times.
B009GGVW6U|3|The quality was good, the fit too loose
B00OKKRLFS|5|Bought these for my fiance and she absolutely loves them.. They fit perfect..
B00PU5OTYI|5|Beautiful lucky to find it!!
B0009Q1QJ4|5|This is in fact THE dexter shirt, I had been looking for it for a while now and finally got it. Army is the color Dexter wears but i also got one in white because it was a good price, the army colored one is fantastic, i got a large and it was a bit too big so i put in the wash on hot and dried it on hot, its a good fit now. Just to let people know, the white is quite see through so you may only want that as an undershirt unless you like people seeing your nipples. anyways.... I am 6'2, 190 lbs. kinda athletic build(i'm not huge but i'm more muscular than most of my friends)and the large is very form-fitting after i shrunk it.
B005IG74DC|5|I bought a big ~ but it is very good<br />I can not wear it, had this pair of pants, a friend gave me a gift
B0093QI4XW|5|Great deal
B00I0MPV40|3|Nice but DONT dry it. It shrunk two sizes on permanent press heat with a full load of laundry. My fianc&eacute;e was very disappointed. Until it shrunk, it was among his favorites for overall look, fit, quality, thickness, and softness.
B00CDBPK7W|5|Pants are very fit, I was like,<br />I will continue to focus on the future, would recommend to friends，Reasonable price
B00JX00OGS|4|I don't know what there is about the &#34;Despicable Me&#34; world that makes you want to be a part of it, but obviously it appeals to young and old. Who knew I would be wearing a Minion T-shirt in my late '50s? Anyway, it's a fine shirt with eye-catching style. In other words, a good dealio.
B00BCUPEVW|4|Jeans are jeans love them
B005LJQTXW|3|These are probably the most comfortable socks I've ever owned, with one exception. The little non-slip adhesive in the back doesn't work as well as it should, so if you wear them with Toms, which is why I bought them, they slide down a lot. But they're still extremely soft and comfy!
B004QMIB9K|1|These pants did not look anything like the picture. The elastic band to the top of &#34;belly band&#34; made it uncomfortable. fabric was cheap and far from fitted as seen in the pic.<br />Not true to size, very big. Not Recommended.
B001E30JVM|5|i have had this Storus brand stainless clip for over 5 years<br />recently had an issue with the clip (paper $$) side geting loose<br />called and spoke to the inventor!!<br />he said push down with your palm and it will tighten up<br />i did and it's back to like new!!<br /><br />this is a terrific product - not sure how people have ANY issue with it
B001E5QYT6|5|Happy with fit and overall quality. I am 5'4&#34; and around 110, and the medium was a good fit. Wig is snug and after 3 hours in it glad to take it off. Don't see how folks in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries tolerated the wig!
B007GYYRO8|2|Wrong color, need a darker navy.  I will need to return
B001CVK2XG|5|These are exactly what the photo shows. The were nice as a costume accessory. We wete very pleased with the quality.
B00NUPTKL2|4|everything was as stated. will buy again!
B00G4OYEMQ|5|Comfortable and breathable.  I don't have the typical &#34;cut&#34; MMA body so I was worried the sizes were going to run small but no the large was perfect like any normal t-shirt.  Great lightweight material.
B00MG7O3M6|4|It fitted very well
B00RE7TLOS|3|Runs small especially on the upper body
B001DXTD4M|2|Round is not good.
B000W9PNUQ|5|Beautiful, quality is more than meets the picture
B00KOF59QQ|3|just run smile looks good on my sister she definitely has the figure for the dress I am disappointed that I wanted to cancel the order and they sent me the outfit anyways so we just kept it other than that I guess we're happy with it
B00DAU6N1C|4|This dress is quite nice, and I did order a size larger than normal and it fits great. My only surprise was that the lace around the waist does NOT have a lining, so your tummy shows through unless you wear a slip or cami. Same thing with the trim at the bottom: look at the picture closely, and you'll see there's eyelet at the bottom of the dress. Not a problem if you wear a slip, but you should know about it before you buy. I love the material and the fit. Also, the color is not true to the photo: it says it's blue, but the fabric actually has more of a purple tone to it.
B004KJO1Z2|2|The scarf that I bought was made of cheap material and the tassels seemed smashed. Also, I ordered sky blue and it looked very pretty in the picture but when I got it the scarf turned out to be a dull blue. I was really disappointed when I saw it because it was supposed to be a Christmas present.
B0045ON7Q6|5|These have the comfiest waistband of any Jockey underwear we've purchased. The medium fits a 32&#34; to 33&#34; guy.
B0009MZXG0|5|Bought for a hiking trip in Nevada and they do a great job. No blisters or overheating
B0052VZ6E2|4|I ordered this to wear to a wedding, along with a blue dress.  It was very pretty, has a sheen to it and soft.  I am planning to wear it in the winter, with my white coat.  The color is softer than the picture. Great price!
B004SDSZCU|4|These are fully as advertised, reasonably priced, and a pleasing mix of colors.
B009VZRSVO|4|The material is extremely comfortbale and attractive, but the size seems to run larger than other sizing of similar products.
B003WEU9CK|5|It good
B00PI1HJ3W|5|Perfect
B001FPC3QI|5|I bought these in the leopard print to take to Paris.  They stayed on really well, are warm and very chic!
B00LHVAV1O|5|The bottoms are too short, but the top is very comfortable!
B004PVUB5E|1|This is my second time wearing the bra. It was the middle of the day at work and I noticed the wire was poking through my shirt!<br /><br />I spent a lot of money on this...what a waste...<br /><br />bummer.
B00ADYW7FE|4|I liked the fabric ,,, perfect to sleep in. the only thing<br />I didnt like about it is the panties are too small.<br />husband had a happy new year ;)
B00JF34QWQ|4|Cute out fit but tight fitting. my nephew is 8 months old and I thought this would be great for Christmas in 2 months but he's wearing it now and its snug. He is tall for his age but his weight is normal.
B00MNHSY2E|4|The sweatshirt was a gift and I was knocked over with hugs when she rec'd it.  The fit was good, the material was good, the workmanship was very good.  It's been worn and washed a few dozen times and has retained its looks and fit.
B000J09OQ2|4|Ok
B003XIWAK4|3|The sizes run very large in this coat. I ordered a 52 regular, which is usual for me, but had to exchange for a 48. As the sizes go up, the pattern is simply magnified without any change in proportions. The result is a coat that fits in the chest (generously) but with giant shoulders. This coat will appear longer than Three-Quarter length on anyone shorter than 6 feet. The olive color is much darker than in this photo - greenish black would be more accurate. I am returning this item.
B00LAC98F0|3|It's ok but material is thinner than my other cardigans.  Hopefully it will not be as wrinkled as when I received it after I wash it.
B000O7PBDA|3|Nice belt and ok for the price I got it.
B000X9AZDU|5|cool shirt
B006B2RWXE|5|This is a gorgeous shirt!  Fits as expected, and I can't wait to wear it! Should definately be worn with a backless bra, although you could get away with a thin-strapped black bra (backless would be a more attractive option).  I've ordered 2 more shirts from this merchant, I am expecting the same excellent outcome - SHOP ON LADIES!!!!!!
B00359FH0G|3|Nice shirt, but, it is a true Red shirt, not a Burgundy color.
B00HA228BA|1|this would've been a cute shirt if it werent that big. its basically a mens tee and not ment to be uni-sex at all. not happy at all. waste of money.
B00NL0ZU7Y|1|I saw this online and fell in love, the colors are amazing and I thought for $58 it was a good deal. I opened the package to find just a top when the product description says &#34;One-piece swimsuit featuring printed blouson bodice and solid bottom&#34;. I am so disappointed with this product, it was very deceiving. I thought I was getting a bathing suit when I actually got only a top.
B004VA7H10|5|This is a great gift for any Star Wars fan. My son loves to wear it to school and to sleep.
B00EZHPNW4|4|I usually don't buy underwear online but I'm glad I did.  Comfortable fit.  I was very pleased with the purchase
B00888EUVQ|5|So many compliments and stares on this fantastic dress. Made me look and feel sexy, good quality as well. No regrets here!! I love wearing this dress!!
B000UZRCQK|2|This bra does a great job of pushing what I do have down into submission.  For a C cup like myself, I like to lift them up, not squash them... feeling like Yentel.
B007U3P79Y|2|The colors are very pretty but the size small is too small. Purchased for my 14 year old and it is really to young looking for her as well.
B00FFEHWLG|5|Excellent last-minute father's day present. Fit as expected.
B0073HQOM6|5|Wish there was a way to make minor adjustments to size. Tilt head add it will fall off. But I ordered another one small of course for a friend. Quality of Hat is superior. It is really a beautiful hat. Glad I got it
B0096GO2YO|5|Love it. Looks tough
B0089M9R1E|4|The shirt is great.  Vivid colors & heavy weight.  The heading above changed during my order (when picking a size to be precise) to read 'youth' not 'boys'.  I thought i was going to get a large youth shirt instead I received a bigger boys large. He really would have liked this shirt but it is much too large for a 5 year old Minus 1 star for advertising glitch.
B00MZ558M8|3|They fit ok when I first put them on but stretch out when you wear them.
B004TA8RT8|5|My mother in law loved this!
B00BR9W8JO|2|I tried these on my uniform and they worked OK. The problem it the wrench strips out the screw, so unless you're putting pins on something permanently, they can be very hard to remove.
B00EDHFSM6|5|Excellent casual pant, you will get exactly what You see in the picture, well combined with one denim shirt and the proper shoes, will get You a unique style. If You are in shape will enhance the structure of Your body. Thanks!
B0055U6BTE|5|The items came quickly and were just as described.  I gave this as a shower gift b/c the Dad to be is Batman crazy - this was perfect.
B008XIQ13G|5|It is a good jean and nice price in Diesel product. The fabric quality is good, but the colour is looks more wild. It is good to wear in warm weather(no good for winter). Because the colour and wash is lighter. I don't like the button fly but have to accept. I have another diesel belther series, it is same button fly. I wear Levis W31L30(511 need to be W32L30 or L31), but for Diesel jean, W30L30 is perfect.
B00JVJWYJQ|5|I love my Michael kors
B00BPFB47M|5|I love these liners...I use them all the time in all of my shoes. They keep my feet dry, and my shoes tidy.
B000WPGIAY|5|I was really impressed with the quality of the costume. I'm so glad I purchased it! It even arrived in a really nice garment bag for storing. It looked nice on and wasn't too short. I, upon reading the other reviews, also bought a petticoat to wear underneath just in case. I ordered a small and it fit me- I'm normally a size 4-6, 35 bust, 28.5 waist. I would recommend this product to others.
B00KMTL9T0|2|didn't get a refund, don't know how to contact a seller
B00R9RLSQ2|5|Perfect except I have to get them hemmed..
B00CAMLH58|5|what a great deal! fit is great almost like a glove. just the strap needs to beadjusted (short person problem). dress came around the time i expected.
B00BKRMG90|5|The dress is the color shown which was nice. It fits tightly on the chest/boobs. Can't wear a bra with it. Flowy from the chest down and roomy. My pregnant bridesmaid could have worn it. My friend with big boobs had to order up and we're sewing it to fit her every where else and my sister with smaller boobs still complained that the chest was tight. Should order your size because it is true to size for the most part unless you have big boobs, just expect it to be tight in the chest.
B00MP27BFI|1|It's large and too long with the size S
B0053XF8W4|5|This is a nice product. I havn't had any problems with rolling up. It does its job without making you stiff looking and there's no seams or bumps that would show through your other clothes!!
B00D3HZVQU|4|It's a little tight, but every bra fits differently.  I had recent shoulder surgery and my regulars bras are killing my shoulders.  The racer back takes the pressure off, but the straps are visible with most of my blouses, so there is definitely a trade-off.
B001NFNY2M|5|100% satisfied
B008F4HQSC|4|I returned this nicely made jacket, not because of any fault of the mfg. The overall picture was what I was looking for, except I thought the material would be like the London Fog. I am looking for a more dressy jacket that can go with a skirt as well as jeans to the market. This jacket is more sporty than what my tastes are.  Colombia does put out good quality in sports wear. I selected an XL which fit good and in Oregon I could wear a sweater underneath and not be cold or too warm in stores. I am 5'7 and 165 lbs. The sleeves are a bit long but can be cuffed as shown in the picture and not take away from the overall appearance. Sorry it didn't work.
B00LBUHAY2|4|Good purchase for the price!
B005GYGFZY|5|VERY GOOD......
B002JFOU64|5|Excelent product, high quality, it looks better in person.
B00CBK6SDK|5|Great product. fits well.
B00OLUTF7Y|5|Cute dress a runs a little small. Good quality fabric looks just like pic very happy with it
B00JZJTVU2|5|Great
B00KS70A78|5|Now have three pairs. Love them, hope they come out with Capri and shorts.  So soft same fit all day.
B00J568MIW|1|Beyond disappointed. The fabric is thin and easily tears. The pictures and descriptions are incredibly misleading. The swimsuit bottoms are incredibly tight and altogether the product is very cheap.
B001O9BEFG|5|Perfect fit, wonderful quality, better than Nordstroms quality. This is saying a lot. I will tell all my friends and already started
B000YPMJKA|5|This makeup is pretty stinking awesome! It went above and beyond my expectations once I tried it. The best part about it is that you don't need to use much to cover your face and you can spread it really thin for a light yellow look or put more on according to what shade of yellow you want or how bright you want it { which gets even better once you see how much product really does come in that tube }. All in all it's a great product and when I need more I'll definitely be getting this product since I know it does what I want it to. Highly recommend!
B00BCUP9YE|5|Nice quality, good fit....I highly reccomend....
B00GDGEY5C|3|Good value.  Fit is as expected.  Zipper is on left hand side, makes us guys have to think! :)
B00LPTXV5Q|5|Love these jeans and the flare is a fun change from the skinny jeans. I LOVE TR jeans and have for years, these do not disappoint in the fact that they r thicker jeans than other brands, but have great stretch. The length and flare opening r perfect (not too long or wide) and the rise is just right at 8.5. All in all, these exentuates the butt and lengthens the legs!! Quality Jeans that also wont snag as some of the other &#34;premium&#34; denim does.
B0081X5MBA|5|This is a very cute outfit, it was the right size, and my little man look super cute in it. Would definitely buy again.
B00IIP4CMQ|5|My grandson loves these and i will be purchasing more in the near future... They seem to be washed constantly because there isnt enough for the whole week....
B005BNJ1W4|5|Item arrived on time as indicated. Packaging acceptable, well made, worth the price. I would order these again from the shipper.
B008AEEEU0|3|The design and the material is good. I ordered the small size, however the shirt is somewhat large for me. I always wear small size since, I am 5 ft and 115 lbs. I wore it in skinny jeans and looks baggy but okay. Next time, I make sure I order extra small. Hopefully that will work for me.
B003Y61NEE|3|Cute as a button.. Wish it fit better
B0090HPKH2|3|I kept on wearing it for almost one month but I have not see any effect.<br />and not like other's description, it is not tight for me at all  and even looser than ordinary leggings. But the length is ok for my leg.<br />Hope in the future it will work.
B00304819U|1|Undoing the velcro on these gloves tore them apart.  Cool Looking glove, just have black tape on hand if you buy them
B004ZZHO7S|5|Bought this for a steampunk costume.  It's good quality leather and looks perfect with a set of steampunk victorian welding goggles also from Amazon.
B00CIPJV4Q|5|I love it ,very good product ,Quality and Price .I recommend it to anyone.<br />specially for my Home.<br />enjoy it.
B004LH3KXM|5|arrived promptly.  good quality for price.  like it!
B00LM6STN6|5|Perfect fit
B00EZJDVBW|3|Material is cheap and thin, but I may be able to pull it off with a cute bottom piece.
B002VTSNSO|1|It suppose to glow in the dark right? well mine doesnt glow at all! i throw it away a day after i got it.
B007JS914M|5|Love it.  Fits well and washes like a dream. It was well worth the cost of this sweater, I am glad I purchased it.
B00KDRP4FG|5|Neat belt. Easy to &#34;adjust&#34; for your size. Looks like quality, both the leather and the buckle.
B00BGHTGN8|5|I wanted to take a chance with something that has a young flair and was surprisingly pleased with the design and cut of this blouse.  It's more sheer than i expected, so a camisole is recommended.<br />It can be worn off the shoulders as well...and who doesn't like to show off their shoulders!
B007U26W6C|4|My husband loves the style, the color and fit.  The size XL fits like the usual L is supposed to fit.
B009UV600Y|4|Was as I exspected
B00023KM0S|5|overalls were delivered on time and was exactly what I expected,true fit.
B004YGRB8A|5|Nice jacket; however, it was too big for me. It was a size Large & I am pretty much a large in every jacket. I would have returned it for a medium, but they didn't have any in stock. Returning the item was extremely easy. I don't think that Amazon could have made it any easier. I was really impressed.
B001V8YMB8|3|a little tight at the belly. like the quality of the materrial. will buy it again and will tell to friends
B008XG4G8A|2|I size I ordered was extra large, but it still was too small for me.  I gave it to a friend of mine.
B00FEA1RXK|5|It's awesome! It's very soft and springy, and the colors are in layers so the curls are easy to keep together. I ran my wig comb through it and the curls were still easy to restore. I got a lot of compliments wearing this in public, and some people had to ask whether it was natural and dyed. It fits pretty well too, and didn't require pinning because it's deceptively light-weight. I also have my natural hair cut pretty short, so wigs have become less trouble in general.
B00FP9KQWI|4|Very beautiful. No marks or scratches. A must have for any Zelda fan! The only problem I have with it at the time being is that it's a little stiff and doesn't open very wide.
B004SWIWLU|4|But. Its ok ;)<br />Customer service awsome!
B00FFXJ4F4|5|great product and price
B00BJNFO7G|5|I'm super happy with this top. It will make a great addition to my summer riding shirts. True to size and well fitted even after washing. Super fast shipping ( just 2 business days) . I will be buying more from Barrett HD.
B00JBXUJ1C|4|I read other reviews thinking they ran big, then bought them a half size bigger as recommended. They were too big! They fit true to size.
B00QQTR516|5|Love it! I'm 5 ft 4in. and it comes to within an inch of my knees.
B00TCK9RM6|4|Very pretty was given as a gift. Recipient loved it. Not sure of the fit but looked like a good size for an average 12m baby. Didn't look small.
B0000ZBSWO|5|I love this brand of bras here at Her room.com/Amazon.This bra was priced under $20.00.I like the fit.I really like the style too!The material is nice.I had to go up in inches around to give me room for bloating.The cup size is accurate.
B0074H0HXW|5|I ordered these to go with my 18 month old daughter's Christmas dress after I couldn't find any in our local stores.  These were wonderful- soft and warm.  My daughter was comfortable and looked adorable.  The stockings stood up to boots going on and off.  I would buy them again.
B00A7ZBHUA|2|Beautiful tights but even though I am well within the size range specified &#34;Fits 4'9&#34; - 5'9&#34;, 100-165 lbs.&#34; they do not even come close to fitting.  At a perfectly average, athletic size of 5'5&#34; 130 there was not a chance of getting into these things - I gave up, they would have torn otherwise
B000T3UYG8|4|It is not padded (big plus), stays in place, a little tight but not uncomfortable.
B00B5KLK6W|5|i love the color<br />ilove the way it fits<br />it was just perfect<br />it looks better in person.<br />i love it
B00IPXUTTG|1|Worst quality ever. The buttons don't go straight up and down the twist around your body.
B007147KHY|5|This is a comfortable, tee shirt, made of some type of nylon material.<br />I like it and wear it from time to time.
B00BMURTII|5|Bought these leggings due to the fact that they were a little longer. They fit just perfect and are long enough to reach the ankle, which I love, (don't like waiting for high tide) being tall makes it hard to find length in leggings. Great buy and will purchase in different colors for sure.
B00BL14L9I|5|She loved it. Going to be wearing it often
B00O1WFPBC|5|my daughter feels like a real Princess in this wig she loves it.
B00AFQG5CG|2|It's fits tighter that I expected. This is supposed to be the regular size I wear maybe it's a different size?
B00C7YIY8C|5|Better than what I expected
B00VAK91WW|1|This Apron looks like it was made to fit a VERY SMALL adult or child!!!!!
B00N1RWY0S|3|Should have taken them more seriously...I would ordinarily wear a med...so I ordered an EXTRA LARGE....it fits me like a SMALL.<br />But it is soooo cute that I have to find a little person that would appreciate it....not returning it.
B003AIKXQK|3|This gown is really cute, but does run really small. It was too snug to put on our 8 - 1/2 pound baby.
B00CBEH62I|5|These jeans were better than I expected.  Very comfortable and look good. The cell phone pocket is great, I have a Samsung S4 with a case and it fits in the pocket just right. If I had one complaint, they ride a bit low.
B00GVL8A86|5|I own a lot of scares, and some of them are very high end/pricey. This is exceptional for the price. I ordered the taupe to wear with my trench coat. It looks great. I liked it so much I ordered the red one to wear with black blazers. It's got a great length for doubling, without being too long or short.  The fabric is not too heavy.  I really love the look of the subtle owls.  Would recommend this scarf.
B00180G8U2|5|this is a great neutral swim diaper that functions fabulously. Love the snaps! I have the smaller size with no snaps and its been great, so I was happy to find this larger size with the snaps!
B00PVWWH30|1|i hate ,it like xxxxxxxxxxsmalll, i never saw something so unfittable
B000GW1PCE|4|I love the sweater. It looks good, fits well, and is warm enough. Ordering was no problem and it arrived promptly. Shipping and handling costs were a bit high.
B0084ZAWJM|4|Very nice coat, it looks very sleek and as advertised it could fit many weather conditions as you can layer it off depending on what you're wearing and how cold is outside. I got it for about $200 which i think is fair for the good quality, but ot ws supposed to be compared to $400-something which i think it would be too much for it.
B001DO9UD0|5|Love these all-day comfort Carharts. I layer 100% merino wool leggings underneath for flexibility, comfort, and moisture wicking. Note: they are NOT water proof & aren't meant to be. Some folks waterproof them with spray - I just keep an extra dry pair around for wet days.
B0081SD04Q|5|Extremely comfortable and warm
B004BQFFXQ|5|Excelent
B005A20W4C|4|ok
B00NTZJ0BI|4|mad decent shirt.
B00D5P8CE8|2|I bought these in the hopes that they'd be a fair replacement for the discontinued Maidenform 40717, which was like the holy grail of boy shorts - comfortable, absolutely no panty lines, well-fitting, and sexy (stretch lace). These are like granny panties compared to those and the material feels like a cheap nightgown. Do they fit? Well, yeah, but you'll have panty lines under anything form fitting. So sad that these didn't work out. :(
B001KFT5CS|5|Feels good fits well and good quality material<br /><br />Would Buy again!<br /><br />good value for your money.<br /><br />good brand to buy
B00S3G1WKK|5|I bought these hats for my twin girls.  They fit great, and my girls love to wear them.  My girls have always had large heads, and I wanted to get away from the kid hats because of their sizing and graphics. Arrived on time and were on their heads the minute I opened the box.
B00KA4EFIE|2|I really like the style but the material is so cheap. Its very thin...I cant wear this to go anywhere.<br /><br />I normally wear size 12 so based on the other reviews I ordered a XXL to be safe and it was a little to big but the material is awful anyway so I would not wear it.<br /><br />DON'T BE FOOLED LIKE ME...NEVER AGAIN
B0073E5308|3|I've always been told I have a big head. Unfortunately, somehow this Mask is too large for it. It smells like spray paint & the paint job is horrible if you look closely. However, at an occasional costume party it looks good. You can breathe just fine in it. It's more comfortable then it looks. I had to add a velcro strap to tighten it up. It actually looks pretty real for being made out of latex.
B00NEYA1LW|5|very comfy originally bought the mid profile also very comfy fit but i prefer this shorter hat. still wear the other hat for yard work and use this for everyday wear. plus nice dark./dull bluish look
B00SATD1BI|5|Best fitting pants ever; so comfortable!
B00APT82K6|5|I luv the way they fit. . they are soft , not binding, I wish you made a larger size cup. these will do good for now. If U offer a G or H cup let me know.
B005EE37TS|5|i love this tee. it's soft, flexible, and looks super cute with a pair of leggins and boots. i wear it at least once a week. But i came back to get other colors and they are gone :( bummer.
B003ICZRIW|5|This was so fun!  I thought surely I'd receive it and it wouldn't be nearly as cool as it was online--but I was wrong! It was fun to wear and made a statement.
B00NI5Q9XG|4|Good Product
B006SRTGB8|1|It's Fake and not the original that you will see in the stores .
B00AV4W8D2|5|A nice, cool, comfortable skirt to wear during warm weather.  Good fit and hits just a little above the knee for a nice look.
B009H8PTR0|5|These pants will change your life!!  If you don't have these you are missing out!!  I wear mine everyday!!  Yes, I have 8 pairs:):)
B00CBEU134|3|Length is perfect but little bit tight from waist<br />If you'll make usa M (Asia L) length of 25.5&#34; it will be perfect
B00369D1KI|2|I usually where a DD so you think this should fit. When I tried it was comical how small it was. Now I have to return it and purchase a bigger one. Hopefully that one fit.
B004SW9N9K|4|I bought these for a halloween costume but after putting them on, they look super cute and fit well.  I have worn them now just as  regular every day outfit and love them. They are comfy and look great on.
B00HN3TL16|2|Way to tight in the belt area. says it is strechy and is not. be sure to go 2 sizes up.
B005ABQFZS|5|It's slightly bigger than I thought it would be, but I love it and wear it all the time. It's warm and comfortable.
B00CLEP3ZU|3|Wow, I'm a happy camper.  Going by the pictures, I took a chance on ordering the 'red/yellow' ombre three-tone scarf, because I suspected it wasn't really red, but maroon.  Yeppers!<br /><br />Actual scarf is maroon/maroon brown/muted flame orange/muted sun yellow, with black seam all around.  The brown 'fades' to black.  So it's perfect for what I wanted, to match my maroon business suits, besides the black blazers, yellow sun blazer, brown, etc.  The brown is a rich brown, shaded between true milk chocolate brown and semi-sweet chocolate/matte brown.<br /><br />Fabric is very nice, high-quality.  See-through, classy.  Will easily snag, as is to be expected.  Will re-rate up or down after washing.  EDIT: rated down one star (from 4 to 3) because the FOLD MARKS in the scarf when shipped folded -- don't wash out.  At least, not after the scarf is soaked and then hung.  I tried again by machine washing on delicate cold with other scarves, then tumble dry low, moisture sensor on 'less' dry.  Some but not all of the FOLD MARKS came out.  Pity.  NOTE: it does not help to hang the scarf to dry.  The tumbling does more to remove the marks, than hang drying.  Further, dry it with other scarves or nylon delicates at the same time, else you won't get good results.<br /><br />Hopefully if I wash-and-dry again and again, the FOLD MARKS will fully abate.  At least it can be machine washed and can be machine dried.  (Suggest no longer than 10-15 minutes on moisture-sensor 'low' setting.)
B00EHLKP5S|5|I am an 18/20 and ordered the Q2. It's perfect! I love, love, love it. I've worn it a million times this month. Under dresses, tank tops, low cut shirts. It's great! I just ordered 2 more just in case they are discontinued. I washed it in the washer, but I think I will hand wash it from now on to make it last longer. I love that it's not cotton looking, but silkier (rayon and spandex) so it looks as dressy as my clothes.
B004MKNOJ8|4|I love look of this dress!  The neckline is very unique and I received lots of compliments on it. The material is the perfect weight and feels luxurious.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it arrived with a few white spots -- almost like chalk (a little water got it off) and one of the belt loops was broken (I ended up just cutting off the loop on the other side).  Great dress for when you want to be sexy yet conservative.
B001A68CL2|3|The hat runs small! The cord to tighten it is worthless and you can all but forget being able  to tuck the sun flap into the cap so that you can wear it as a traditional cap. Looks like I'll be giving this away....
B00COBLGL0|5|Very pretty
B0054SO51I|5|These are nice. I wear them for work and for hiking. They are very well made.
B00FQDJLDI|4|I love love love the color of this sweater! super soft and something that would keep me warm! the only thing i have to complain about is this sweater is constantly falling off my shoulders. Very small complaint. I love it though, Something you don't see everyday.
B004OT9G94|5|I love this shirt
B0009JTH1A|3|Did I miss the info that the pants came without pockets? if not it should have been mentioned. No other complaint
B0018OQNG2|1|I been wearing Levi's jeans for 40 year's but the quality is no good any more now that they are all imported their simply junk
B00EORIAYS|3|The necklace is really cool looking and came with the other gift, as promised. however, the print on mine was very scratched up and i was disappointed... still wearing it though!
B00HBKAS0E|4|THIS IS A GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO LOVES SUPERNATURAL.  IT IS A BIT SMALL FOR A LARGE, BUT HOPEFULLY IT WILL FIT HER.
B00K5ZEORK|4|Cute and good quality.  The price was a little high.  Probably won't have paid as much except I wanted it for a Christmas gift.
B00QTT63D4|3|I saw the Bacon & Eggs blank tank top in a commercial for Odd Mom Out on Bravo and knew I wanted one.<br />The shirt is ok, going by the size chart -- it is somewhat smaller than I expected, I should've went with the next size up.<br />The print is good. It is a thick print though.
B00EPKHZ7W|4|great vest, prompt delivery
B000V5O6WW|5|Dickies always true to size and a great product.
B00N4XZ4C4|5|Beautiful and cozy.  I love it.  Great for lounging around the house
B008XFATP0|4|it was a really nice t-shirt for my niece
B000ZQAFIQ|4|It is nicely done, thick and very warm material but the only negative fact is that the image is different that the product because the mouth hole is actually large than you think...but it's ok.
B00TFAT48K|5|Great swim shorts!
B0010J6BFI|4|Wonderful little tshirt for a true Peyton Manning lover!  Good quality too.  The customer service department people are really great to work with.  They strive to understand any difficulties or misunderstandings that come up and go beyond what is necessary to correct things.  I'd buy from them again in a heartbeat! (We had a misunderstanding about shipping times and without asking, they refunded my shipping fees AND gave me a coupon for free shipping in the future....I've never come across THAT level of service anywhere!)
B009ICG4LA|5|It was a great buy for a special fun occasion.....
B00412N97E|5|I was surprised at how good the quality of this item is at such a small price.  It totally completed my pirate's costume, giving the skirt a full/fluffy look.  I would highly recommend this item.
B00O8P8LMM|3|It was cute with the owl. I order a small but it was too big for me :( One thing that I hate about this blouse is that the lace part of the blouse is very itchy and uncomfortable. I would not recommend this blouse to short or skinny people unless they have an extra small which they don't.
B00CHHBQHK|2|What is that horrible smell?!?  Even after about 5 washes, these jeans still stink like some terrible chemical. Not happy at all.  They fit fine, but the smell ruins it for me and I am afraid of what it might do to my son (give him a headache or worse...)  I am not an alarmist but what is it???
B004A7XY02|5|They come in a veriety which is great anf they fit me wonderfully. Tehy are also very comfortable and soft to wear. They arrived earlier than estimated so that is even more of a bonus.
B00FI9VDD6|5|I really liked the fit ,I liked the way I can wear all 4 pieces & most of all I like that it is SEXY !
B008FB5B9G|1|Do not be mislead as I was. The ACTUAL size of these socks is 4-9.5 NOT 9-11.<br />The fabric is too thin. These are not good quality socks.
B000SP6UVK|4|I hadn't realized how threadbare my current socks were until I ordered these replacements. They feel good and fit well. Yay!
B00PQDWBIK|1|It took 78 days to arrive and it looks nothing like the picture. I am a juniors small and ordered a small, it looks like a child size medium, the material is very thin and you can see through it and the butterfly pattern is not at all as what is pictured and it isnt even close to being the same color as what is pictured, very unhappy with this purchase, there was no indication that it was coming from China or I would have never bought it.
B004VQBJPO|1|I wear a size 32 pants. Every pair of pants I own is a size 32. These pants do not fit me at all. Would not recommend.
B00BPEN4J4|5|EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE! What is better than comfy socks? Comfy Doctor Who socks!! I am a Whovian and I was so excited to receive these socks. They came looking just like the picture and I was thrilled that they were also soft and comfortable. I live in Florida and I like my socks to be minimal (low cut or ankle socks and thin), but still sturdy and comfortable. These socks are all of these things I love the colors. I have worn the blue and orange a few times. The grey have been neglected because they aren't as bright...but I will get to them too. They are slightly big on me because the black ankle part is up on my heel. However, they feel like they fit perfect. The huge dalek print is amazing. Overall, these are great socks and would be great as a gift for any Whovian. I recommend them.<br /><br />*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.
B00FSKRM8A|5|Very nice and made very well. Amazing price!
B00HNYVV0O|3|Up to size 18 my a** I'm a medium that's size 8/10 and this is see through on me! Also what's with the shine??! I hate the fact that they run small and are shiny other than that they are very comfortable.
B00UKWQD86|5|I know that most clothing from China runs a little small. I'm a 34 waist and ordered a large suit and it was a little snug but on the beach there is nothing wrong with that. I got several positive comments from women who obviously liked the way it fits. It is very comfortable and does show the package nicely. One problem one may have at a family type beach is that in addition to really showing a bulge, when the suit gets wet the penis is very noticeable. Wear with caution.
B00KBZOEMY|4|Fit was bit looser than planned, but was still comfortable.
B00HO5MLLK|5|Son loves it, good quality and fit
B00BXRTDWA|5|My husband bought this belt. Not my favorite design.  He is turning into a grandpa.  Great belt.  Quality made belt.
B00TIWW7ZW|4|very good fabric and presentable. very in keeping with its reasonable price
B00HGRHBKC|5|I read the reviews and how people said it fit. I usually wear a men's XL shirt but I couldn't tell if these were men's sizes or women's sizes. I saw in some reviews where the bigger sizes were longer, so I went with XL and crossed my fingers. It isn't as loose as I had hoped, but it does fit and isn't too long (and didn't shrink when I washed it, thank goodness). The assessment of the color was true to- picture looks more purple but the shirt is more magenta. Overall, I really like it and plan on buying another one as a gift.
B00BXH3ZO2|5|Initially, I ordered my waist trainer on Sept/15/14, I received it the next day (using amazon prime 4$ one day shipping). I'm guessing I must have mistakenly ordered and 2X which was way to big! By the way I am 20, I weight 194.4 lbs, 5'4 and im 38C bra, 35 inches in the waist and a 42 in the hips. I love this product! I went ahead and ordered the correct size and got the new one yesterday and so far so good! its a great investment.  As you loose the inches and the weight, you will have to purchase smaller waist cinchers to shrink with you!  GREAT INVESTMENT!
B00OSO21W4|5|These are great socks!! I am in love with them. They look so great and are well made. They are thick and comfy, I could wear them 24/7. These socks should last a long time. They fit great. I love the color combination, I don't love bright colors so these were perfect for me. These are quality socks, not cheaply made. These are going to keep my legs so warm this winter. I'm thinking they would be great to wear at the hospital when I have surgery because it's always so cold and these will keep you warm.<br />I recieved this product at a reduced rate in exchange for an honest
B00863BTS0|2|I bought this cute set for my daughter. She has only worn it once and the seams are coming apart after washing on delicate. Very disappointed...
B00JR4PE4W|5|Wow!!<br />As a large chested person (36DDD), I have had such bad luck with bras. Uncomfortable underwires seemed my only option, and when I gained a little weight my bras were not fitting anymore. Wire was cutting in, back straps too tight, boob spillage in front.I was the type of person counting the hours until I could get home and take my bra off.<br /><br />And then I tried one of these. When you first feel it, it feels like pajama silk or fancy underwear. It is SOFT! Feels like I'm not wearing anything! Straps are comfortable. Boobs look great. Looks nice under a shirt. No more agony! I will actually enjoy wearing them around the house. Just bought 2 more!
B001ICQDIM|3|I buy PJs too large on purpose, for comfort.  I take them in as needed.  And then I cut off  some length and hem them shorter.  .<br /><br />These have frustrated me.  The fabric is very difficult to work with.  It slips and slides.  Even with a new and very fine needle in the machine, the thread bunches up, so the pajamas do not look good.  I have worn myself out trying to fix them and will just have to make the most of a bad job, even though I hate giving up!.<br />.
B002APXJLU|2|The product arrived and I think the y were labeled wrong from the factory. Way too long in their length (I am only 5' 11&#34;) ... I passed them on to my son, who's 6'5&#34; and the fit him fine. I am going to try to order more in the future and hope I get one that's sized properly. Not sure where they were manufactured...
B00GFH4LXE|5|my daughter hs it on no as I am typing
B00T0U54CU|5|JUST LOVE THE FEEL OF IT AND CANT WAIT TO WEAR IT ALONE IN BETTER WEATHER
B00N2C8V4U|5|Absolutely gorgeous dress! But it does run a tad small! You are better off ordering a size bigger and then altering it to fit! Other than that, it's a beautiful gown!
B007KFN36G|4|Usually some stockings have itchy material but these pair of over the knee are comfortable!Thy fit perfectly on me! The thing that I love about these stockings is that they are very stretchy so you can pull them up to your liking.Very FAST shipping which was VERY convenient!!
B00V9XTSAA|5|Simply amazing. I hardly do reviews, however the reviews is what made me decide to try it. Fits better than the other waist trainers running 50-80.00 and comfy enough to withstand it all day
B00UA5UDJS|5|A little bit tight on the hips but it's ok. Maybe 1size bigger would have fit better, breast fits fine. Its one piece, so, i think im fine with it.
B007NLY2TE|4|I was nervous about buying a swimsuit online, but this one looks just as pictured though the laces on the sides show a tiny bit more than I expected. It arrived very fast.
B008O63OZ0|5|Cute dress!
B00DMWQJ58|4|Much better than I expected. The gloves fit well, stretchy, have a sheen to them, and a rich black. They don't stay up around the elbows, so I am not sure what to do about that yet. But I like the gloves.
B0010X4F02|5|Kept me in my pre-pregnancy clothes throughout my entire pregnancy! I didn't have to buy maternity pants so definitely worth the money!
B00PDFJAX0|5|will probably buy more
B00550QFDQ|4|Very comfortable bra.
B001J6OO6A|4|Like the bra, if you can say a bra is comfortable, I guess this one gets pretty close.  No problems with fit, as it fits very nice, comfortable shoulders.  I'd probably buy this brand again.
B008QV765C|1|When I make my order I choose M size but it's feel like XL and I can't wear it so far
B006GHMSUG|5|It is a beautiful piece. It does take a bit of patience and undersanding to put on correctly but when its put on correctly its amazing. My bf was thrilled. Im 117lbs Bcup 5'1.
B00GA7VPCE|5|good
B002KIA014|4|This was a perfect fit.
B00XTKG7AA|5|LOVE THE SHEEN TO THIS TOP
B00JMAPWNE|5|Beautiful, flowy dress. Vibrant color!  Highly recommend.
B005F50IWK|4|I am approximately 5'4&#34; 135lbs, but I do have a very long torso because of this I needed to order a large costume as the smaller sizes were not long enough. So it would fit properly, I wore the costume with heels to fit in the leg. Also, the tail is very cheaply made and the belt around the waist is huge. I ended up cutting off the tail and adding extra Velcro to the belt. With these few alterations the costume did work and it looked great.
B0062C8E1W|5|But I have been using it to. comfortable.  I will have to order one for myself.  Matching set,  if I would have known that it would fit so well I should have ordered 2.
B008TNNLUG|5|My  husband  like it  lots of fun
B006HFJA12|5|Great!
B00AKMYCIO|3|Was way thinner than expected, threw in the wash and already a run was happening near the shoulder area. Other than that it was fine although the small seemed like an extra small, so I recommend buying one size bigger than you think you are.
B00L2K8DU6|5|Cute kinda big on me but since its 100% cotton i can just wash and shrink it a bit
B00N2FY9DO|5|I bought this little work out get up because I was curious I had never heard of such a thing. I am now a huge fan of it and ordered two more in different colors. I had degenerative disk disease from L2- L5 in my spine. Working out was sometimes painful, not only does this apply compression to my belly it supports my back. I love wearing this for my kickboxing work out. I can still move freely and after 10 mins into my workout I could feel a difference in how my body was responding to my work out.
B00CHS4VNK|1|In robes/clothing they do not ship the items they show in pictures. They send the same crummy brown/rust robe no matter what pattern you actually order.  Nothing like the prints they display. Save your money. They are not honest.
B007HIHLZK|5|Great product, thanks
B004S79EWG|5|Purchased 4 of these belts in colors that you just can't find in regular stores and I was very happy with all of them and the price was fantastic.  I am so glad that I found Amazon because there is such a variety of merchandise.  Bottom line on the belts is that they are true to the colors shown on line and an excellent purchase and run true to size.
B00KCTKMO8|5|Wife loves the colors and fit just right
B00KSE7WOU|5|It looks exactly like in the picture. It's fun and it fits like a glove. I want to buy another one!
B00IEE7VPG|5|Comfy, soft, excellent quality.
B00BI62NUK|4|This was perfect exactly what we wanted the quality is ok not great for the money but it was an excellent gift for a breaking bad fan.
B0028S5XBS|5|it is a good fit - not to tight but tight enough for the firm look I wanted
B007780CPQ|1|Had to send it back at once. Body is too short for a slender woman of 5.5inch and 106lbs.<br />And there is much too much material around the rear end.<br />You have to be small but rather heavy in order that ths swimssuit would fit you.<br />Sorry, because it's a good quality and looks and feels nice.
B004Z30VKC|4|I love plain black pocket t's; I wear them for every occasion.  This seemed like a good deal, and I thought I'd give them a go despite some of the negative reviews.  The definitely shrink a good bit, but thankfully I don't like my X-Large clothes on the large side.  I use these for every day shirts, and also for undershirts.  They are a little thin, but not too thin to wear alone. Decent quality for the price.
B001ULCBG4|5|I've found it. I've finally freakin' found it. The sports bra that makes me stop looking at any other sports bras. I wear a 32D and that makes finding bras in general kind of a challenge, but Wacoal came through again. I wear this bad-boy while lifting heavy and running. It keeps the girls in a comfortable and supported position without creating the dreaded uni-boob. I actually still look pretty and feminine while I'm getting all sweaty and I don't even have to feel uncomfortable to do it. Amazing.
B00N00OJM2|5|This is a very cute hat. It fits my head perfectly.
B004TFIROI|5|Can't go wrong with classic Neff beanies :) Loved the color of this one, very true to the picture. I'm happy with it.
B00LHMGT6O|5|great dress
B00KNT8HU8|4|It's nice sheer but the are very small in length
B007CRR7ZA|5|Very nice onesies. Soft and easy on the babies. Good value as packaged.
B00PJBGSH4|4|Nice jacket wished I had gotten xlarge....it just fits a little snug!!! I received a promo code for a review!!!
B00MXWZQB6|5|Got this at a great price and picked it up for my almost 3-year old.  Appears nice and warm.  We got Navy with red accents (looked orange online) but perfectly happy.
B00J04FS9A|5|My six year old loves these jammies.  The pants are long enough and so far they haven't shrunk.  The material is very soft.
B00SJXVN0G|5|Cute on and comfortable
B00MGUMEZ6|4|The jacket arrived quickly. I ordered a 4t for my 3t daughter, thinking she would be able to have layers under the jacket. However it seems kind of big. More like a 5t. Thin material but it is very cute. I've decided to keep it and wait for her to grown into it.
B00LL3Q65S|1|rip off
B001FOR3HI|1|wallet in the picture looked bigger. its perfect size for a youth not for adult. i would not recommend this item. Sorry!
B00BMVYT62|5|I'm very pleased with this robe. Fabric quality is good, so is the fit. Will definitely recommend to my friends
B00TH22HZI|3|Too small.  Good quality though. Order a size bigger
B00J2UFVSU|5|These are great fitting jeans, I am happy with this product very much.  They are very comfortable, and great quality.
B000J4DH98|5|Insanely quick shipping and it's so adorable
B00HNKHGES|5|Love this set.  Had compliments the entire night.
B00B3PUEQQ|5|size is perfect .my size is XS.it fits perfectly.elegant in design and after wearing the dress got many complements.good to wear for wedding .fabric is good no need to wear shapers. friends came to me asked where did you get the dress.absolutely worth of buying.
B0085U34LY|5|wonderful !!
B006U1EM66|5|Bought these to replace my other pair that were lost. Fit comfortably snugged and keep my ears warm
B00X1E2ANC|5|Very comfy
B00HPBQ0PQ|3|Very cute but runs VERY large. The fabric is very soft and pretty. The cow is darling too. The only real issue is that the 0-6 months size appears to be sized for about a one year old. I love the Mud Pie brand but this was a mistake for them.
B00T3MCFTK|5|I bought it big so she can wear it for a while ..they grow so fast.
B00BTJEIUE|5|I love this scarf!  Every time I wear it I get so many compliments. I've worn it with t-shirts, tank tops, dress tops, dresses ... it just goes with everything. It's a great accessory when you just want to dress up a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. You won't be disappointed! :)
B002YX09R0|5|I previously owned this hat but I stupidly left it on a cruise ship so I just had to get another one.  These hats hold up under any conditions.  As for the packability, it is great.  It does not crush at all.  We just traveled out of the country and I packed it in the bottom of my suitcase so I had clothes, shoes and other things on top of it.  It was in perfect condition when I took it out.  I do think it's somewhat pricey, but overall I'm so glad I purchased this again.
B0072IHTIO|4|Just what I was looking for at a reasonable price
B001D47I48|5|Great material and it´s a must have for Seinfeld fans (and obviously for fans of that particular episode of the show).
B003U18WIS|5|Awesome. Did not expect to find such a cool shirt for such a little-known band.
B0016L2DN4|5|It was just what my grandson wanted.  He has a large collection of Lionel train sets.  Now he feels like a real engineer.
B00JG1JFD2|4|Smaller than other wallets, seems to hold less personal things. Doesn't feel like it would hold much
B00B4NIOPU|3|its super thin but other than that i love the product. great for the fall and spring, but not winter. other than that its a great product.
B00JAM5MZC|4|The fit good. Good choice for the money.
B00IRX553O|5|Love it
B001D6ORJU|5|My 14 year old son played Tom Sawyer in his school play. The hat was very authentic looking to that period and he looked great. It was comfortable and well made.
B00Z90LL1S|1|description states its 143 cm long for an XL size...its actually 133cm (laying flat). Im 5'3 and its about 5 inches above my ankle when I put it on.
B001SN7PQ0|5|fast shipping, fits good even after washing, i'm usually between a large and med. fits great
B00UBMYA44|4|This is really cute, but you should order a size or two larger than what your child typically wears. My 11 mo. old daughter is around 12mo/12-18mo in sizing, and the 18-24mo just barely fit. I will admit she has a nice chubby tummy, though!
B00NGYIRAM|5|It fit great
B00MZIUH9E|5|I &#60;3 my I &#60;3 PINK hoodie! I am in love with it. I have worn it everyday since I've gotten it. Warm & comfortable.
B005GV6EBM|5|I think I'm going to buy another pair, they look great for the office but they are SO comfy I wear them even if I'm just bumming around the house!
B00DU8E52I|3|Seems to run a little small (about 3/4 of a size if that makes sense). The design is very interesting, though a few of the letters are slightly under-printed.
B00368CL4Q|5|I wear a 38 C/D and this is my first time purchasing a sports bra made for bigger busted women.  AND I LOVE THIS THING!!!  I don't bounce at all and it actually gives me 2 boobs. Not the smashed together dreaded uniboob.  I absolutely love it and will most like get a couple more. Great price!
B00XZVMS2E|5|Excellent seller. Excellent product.
B0062WL60S|3|It´s good
B008H4HVXA|3|Nice more in style hat than regular stocking hat.  Great for breezy ball games.  It does fit a little large for me.
B00E8CMCV6|5|So when i bought this blouse i was really excited cuz its so pretty a little nervous about the size; shipping was a lot faster than i thought it was going to be. The material its really nice, i got a XL in size it fit good except that on the top, around shoulders was a little tight but other than that it fits great. Negatives that i found were just a little tight on the top but not to the point that is uncomfortable and i dont really use shirt that are really close on the neck so that for me was a little strange but im pretty sure with a nice big necklace it will look good ;)
B000UXFJWQ|4|I inadvertently ordered Vapor instead of black.  The Vapor color is not as white as 97 bright paper like my notebook screen led me to believe.  Its more of a light light grey.  I wanted a mediumish weight coat so I could layer a light fleece sweater under it when temps dropped to the teens and I could use it without a layered sweater while traveling.<br />The detailing, however is very good.  Pockets are lined with fleecy material that is nicely warm.  Chest exterior pockets are zippered as are the hip pockets.  The lining above the belt line is covered with a tight ventilated mesh.  Fleece lines the interior below the belt line.  Two interior open top patch pockets on the rightside.  Upper for cellphone and lower below the beltline is a bit larger with what looks like a loop for a pen.  Left side upper interior is zippered pouch between the shell and lining with an elastic cable looped thru the zipper pull that disappears into the shell/lining boarder at the bottom of the pocket.  A larger bellow pocket with a velcro flap is below the beltline with an icon for an Apple Video sized device. Front is zippered with covered button down flap.  Fleecy edging at the top of the collar.<br />Anyways, I got it yesterday and used it in 5 deg weather.  For me, the XL sizing is a bit on the shy side (or I've gotten a little wider this winter).  Well, its not roomy enough for me to get my fleece sweater on underneath.  Walking from my car to the office (100-150ft), I felt the cold creeping through.  At the end of the day, I spent 10 minutes or so brushing the new snow off my car and really missed the sweater layer as I felt the cold creeping thru the coat.  This one isn't roomy enough for double duty as an airport traveler as well as short trips outside, so it'll just be for the air traveling I do.
B009S0S44W|2|Bought these for something fun to wear.  Takes a bit to get on because of all of the strings inside the sock.  Kept getting my toes caught.  Real pain to get on!!!  Would not recommend.  Only thing good is color!
B002W1ZWLC|4|Order one size up; great shirt but runs small. The quality is great and the person I bought it for loves it and wears cycling
B00QMJIRXU|2|not true to size..should have gotten a large
B00JXNV1H6|5|Wu Tang Killa Keys!!! :)
B00KZ488IC|5|I have resisted ordering from Sunny Fashion for several holidays. The reviews are all over the place in regard to fit and quality. Finally, the cost savings for such a lovely garment overrode my faith in reviews. Here is my experience:<br />My daughter is 50 inches tall, 50 lbs., and 10 years old and the size 9-10 fits great. The length is just above the knee, the shoulders are not saggy, her waist has plenty of breathing room.<br />The first day she wore one of these dresses, our dog jumped up on her and a claw tore a hole in the dress. A simple stitching has it back in her rotation, but we discovered the dress is not dog-proof!<br />She grows out of and needs new dresses every year, and these will be what she receives. The cost is very low and the quality is not sacrificed.<br />The estimate was 3 weeks for shipping (it ships from China) and on all three of the orders I placed, they all arrived in 2 weeks.<br />We will continue ordering these lovely dresses.
B00H2IFDTQ|5|love it
B005EQJHJA|5|As most boys are rough on their clothes, he LOVES these pants, they are not snug on him at all and fit nice and keep him warm.
B001ECP01M|1|Too small for me.
B00KRRPIB2|5|Well put together.  Love them
B00BULB9VW|3|Looks nice, not to crazy on how it fits and it's a lot thinner then I expected it to be. Not a whole lot of protection form the cold
B0046HHRJ0|3|This product is better for smaller kids.  Not good for a 7 or 8 year old
B00407ZBR6|5|I was a bit leary to order something like this online, but I am quite impressed with the speed of the delivery, presentation of the tie and cufflinks, and though it hasn't been worn yet, the quality seems to be up there with any other brand I've purchased.  The photo shows EXACTLY how the design looks...color and all.
B00IPD60TE|4|Looks great!
B008GVQEJQ|5|I can't believe how nice this wig is for the money.  I'm using it as a Dora the Explorer costume, but would definitely recommend it for someone who wanted a fun, inexpensive wig...shiny and smooth and easy to manage.  I was concerned if it would make it here on time for Halloween, as it was estimated to arrive between 10/28 and 11/15.  And here it is on 10/10...wonderful!
B0019K2MAG|5|I bought these boots for my significant other, his last boots were done for and we were a little short on cash. I was a little skeptical of buying shoes online, especially work boots but the price was unbeatable and eventually I caved. I am glad I did. They came on time and fit perfectly. They did take a few weeks to break in like any decent pair pair of boots, so I recommended wearing them for short periods of time until they are broken in. They still look new and he's had them for a few months now. I would definitely recommend these and will be buying them again in the future.
B00CVV7C7A|5|Awesome costume
B003ZXAA36|5|I like it!  It hasn't lost its color or anything yet.  I have had it for 6 months and it has been used multiple times already.
B001H0QFNS|1|Horrible
B007TFKYMS|5|thats it , it is  just that --..very pretty and sexy
B00IRMQBFQ|5|I love it I use it as a shirt and shirt
B00UMT1T5Y|2|It's very pretty.  However the straps are short and it fits very snug.  It's sewn in the front in a weird way that looks like you have seems or bumps in the front.  It shows badly.  Go the next size up.
B004VDP0XY|5|I was very surprised at the quality of these leggings especially since they were so reasonably priced.  I am a very satisfied customer.  thank you
B00B29SG72|5|Perfect fit!
B00DUIQA76|5|I would buy again.
B00K5ZB2IY|4|bright color and did not bunch up around the not when tied
B003JH8TBS|5|my boyfriend wore these all night with zero complaints.  He is six feet tall and these looked amazing on him!!
B00T122DQW|4|I ordered a 16 and received a 14, but I have kept it and hope for the best!
B00PVR17CM|2|For this coat to be a 5X versus a 2X which is what I original ordered it is still kind of snugged.
B00266PCMW|5|My son is very sensitive to how his clothes feel and if something is too stiff or too scratchy he won't wear it. However he loves this shirt. I have found too many things that he wouldn't wear, now that I've found this, I plan to order several.
B005CKGGMO|4|Dont expect a nice wig when you buy cheap. I bought this to look like an stupid in and it does the job well lol. Great for the price.
B0010Z6RQU|4|I got the XL for and had to give it to my wife (who is a petite plus) because it was too small for me. The shirt itself looks great, and feels great.
B00KSG3GMA|2|Dress not to size
B0069KHG20|4|The Classic Fit, Boot Cut Wrangler is a very good jean.  I learned by accident just how good these jeans fit.<br />On one occasion,  I needed jeans to complete my outfit for a rodeo.  I didn't have much time left to get ready and<br />my daughter said to try her jeans.  I have taken over her jean wardrobe ever since.  And now instead of buying boy<br />jeans that do not look good or fit good,  I always order size 14 long,  (34\\" inseam).  Now my daughter and I wear<br />each others jeans.  If this helps,  my daughter is 6 feet one and weighs 167 pounds.  Thank you Amazon and Thank you Wrangler.<br /><br />  JENNIFERSDAD
B006LHMWJ8|5|as expected!
B005STIRZS|2|I really love the belt, more so the buckle since its not too showy or big, however, it doesnt stay tight and I have to keep re-cinching it constantly.
B001BRDHYM|5|i had mine for a few weeks now and i love it!!! it really \\"drains my brain\\" and helps me sleep. i drag it everywhere and i bring it to the table and eat with it. this is proof enough that this is a must-have for any pok&eacute;mon and/or pikachu fan did i 4get 2 mention that im 14 years old?
B0038ABSHS|1|The bra I recevied is not what is pictured.  The color is the only thing that is accurate.  The cups on the bra I received are so sheer they offer absolutely no support.  I can understand why they don't show someone wearing the actual bra, they would almost be showing a bare chested woman.
B000OAXN00|5|I'm buying them for over 5 years now. They are good, but some models (like &#34;quartz stone&#34;) seem to look as kind'a used...<br />Also, the &#34;fatigue&#34; model was full one size smaller then advertised...<br /><br />These are perfect! I recommend them sincerely.
B0081SPEOU|5|My daughter added this to her wish list not realizing it was UK sizes, so when it came it was too small, it came all the way from Manchester UK, as as luck had it I am from near there, so i got in touch as with perfect timing I was going back just a few days after it arrived.  I drove over to their warehouse and exchanged it for a bigger size.  The quality is great, it is very thick and looks good..My duaghter has not tried it on as yet, but it will probably be a little big this time instead of too small (big is better :)).<br /><br />The company were good to deal with, the product is good as well.
B00CBG36GG|3|Love the concept but my Testicles are extremely large so the &#34;Shelf&#34; mechanism doesn't do much lifting.
B003VLWWOC|5|Love it looks amazing
B006OUSOJO|2|Maybe I can save you some money. This was a splurge. My husband about spit when I told him our baby was wearing a $17 hat. I gotta admit, the Emporer is naked . . . I do love the soft feel of the hat but my baby's similar hats from Target & Old Navy actually hold their shape much better. The rim on this is curvy after washing according to directions. Perhaps I should iron the bill . . .  when I have the time (ha). Cheaper hats just line dried right back into shape. When I was still justifying this purchase, I convinced myself I liked the tie option instead of Velcro. But really, which is easier on a squirmy baby? I have to knot this on the side because there's not exactly any space under a baby's chin except for another chin. So that creates asymmetry and the hat shifts around.<br /><br />If you are into the finer things, go for it, but if not consider this your wake-up call!<br /><br />I give it two stars because it's dang cute.
B0082PF9ME|1|First off, I LOVE Carters stuff. I have many outfits from Carters for each of our 4 children.  These are an epic fail by Carters.  Gowns are great, as newborns like to feel their legs on one another when they are born, but if your baby is like mine (and all babies that I am aware of) and has an umbilical cord, these gowns do not go over that delicate spot easily for middle of the night diaper changes (or ever).  You have to cut the side, so that the elastic will loosen up enough to get the tight bottom up over baby's belly to change a diaper. I hate redirect people away from Carters but for this item, I have had much better luck with the Rabbit Skins or Gap brand gowns as they are much more forgiving at the bottom.
B00PXYM1KU|3|way to small, and very very short
B000J41P2Y|2|These pants were great until I threw them in the dryer. The length was perfect for my 5'7&#34; self but after the dryer escapade they became petite and unwearable. Everything else was fine on them afterwards though.
B00E1LAOGE|5|Very nice
B003B2O8HK|5|I saw this wig at a Halloween store while looking for ideas for a costume. While it was beautiful and did not look like a wig, the price was offsetting. While looking on amazon, I found the same wig at an awesome price and couldn't pass up on the deal. I got my package today via super saver shipping and tried it on immediately. It looks FANTASTIC and looks real. Can't wait for Halloween. And am thinking of growing my hair out if it would look this nice. Highly recommend for any Alice in wonderland or any needs for a perfectly curled long blonde wig. I am one happy girl.
B00AV58UIS|5|This little top and bloomers are adorable!<br />They are cotton knit and seem to be<br />well made.  I think they will wash well.<br />The tiny print says &#34;girl&#34; all the way.<br />I recommend this one!
B005RUBP98|1|I bought these for work, but they're HUGE! Nice quality, but if I'm swimming in them, and already washed them I ended up giving them away. Waste of my time and money. Perhaps I should have tried to return them regardless.
B00LVJIUEM|5|I bought it as a gift for my father-in-law. It was  the best present I have ever given him in  26 years !!! He absolutely loved it!! The fit was great. He loves the extra pockets and padding.  He is an avid hunter and after using product said it was well made.
B00B4X6J0M|3|To be fair, I have not yet worn this shirt. It just arrived today.<br /><br />However, I bought this shirt on Amazon for 22.00 at the same time that I bought this shirt http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K3SZ5A4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  for 16.49.<br /><br />This Amanti shirt, despite being priced about five dollars higher, is of noticably inferior quality when compared to the Geoffrey Beene shirt.The Amanti dress shirt had threads that were unraveling right out of the package.<br /><br />I think overall it will still be a decent shirt, but I would go for the Geoffrey Beene or similar brand.
B00NDVSXOI|5|My husband loved these shirts...
B00EPYCM76|4|I love they way they look,  they shine depending on the light. I have gotten many compliments wearing them.
B00QGM4S4K|4|Good price for what you receive.
B00L66KTRQ|4|Pretty and comfortable, really like the fabric. From other reviews that said the fit was large, I ordered a smaller size than usual. Some of the panties fit beautifully, but 2 of them are a bit skimpy and like to ride up and slip down, so don't wear those as often as the ones that do fit.
B00MPR5R54|5|Comfortable and warm.
B00449BWOQ|1|Way too small
B00MYNGQ8G|4|Pretty good
B00BMW8GHE|4|Inexpensive utility jacket.
B00KIE119C|4|Too small but I did not want to return it.
B00REIMEOG|5|This shirt is great! Very comfortable and good material.
B000VK9TS8|5|This is my 2nd bra in this brand. I was super impressed with my first one and knew right away that I would be ordering this one to wear after my surgery. This new bra is just in a smaller size. I just had breast reduction surgery and it is working great for this healing process. I need to wear a bra 24 hours a day during this time of healing. It has been a month so far. It is really easy to get on and off. The hooks are easy to close. It washes up really well and then I hang it up to dry. It dries in just a couple of hours. I have been wearing this bra 24 hours a day, just taking it off for showering and laundering and it still looks brand new. I am really impressed and would recommend.
B00D4K39MO|1|i dont want to let my girl to wear it.<br /><br />Too bad quality.
B0062URPW8|5|Awesome hat, fits great to any head. High quality product and great value. I can't wait to wear it this winter!
B00CN5CI9G|5|Talk about cute, these are so cute I got one for my daughter and one for my friends daughter. CUTE
B003IBR38A|2|I'm really on the fence about this mask. Got it for a masquerade ball, with the &#34;Burlesque-Boutique Unisex Sparkle Masquerade Venetian Mask&#34; as a back-up in case this one didn't work out. I'm glad I did, I wore it instead.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It is very ornate and attractive. The black/white combination works well, and the gold trim isn't over-the-top. The &#34;cracked&#34; look of the paint along the nose is a nice touch.<br />- There is plenty of room around the eyes, I felt like my vision was much less restricted than with most masks.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- It's uncomfortable. The mask doesn't fit the contours of the human face well; the bottom of the mask came just below my cheekbones, and it curves inward so that it dug into my cheeks at an angle instead of resting against them.<br />- It is heavy. The length of the nose meant that the mask tilted downwards, i.e. away from my forehead. This made it dig into my cheeks all the more.<br />- The ribbon ties are ineffective. This goes along with the heaviness of the mask. I could not tie it tight enough so it wasn't constantly slipping. I ended up replacing the ribbons with elastic and felt padding. However, even when the mask was fitting more snugly, it still slipped occasionally due to the weight.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- The mask's nose is very long. It works well for a semi-creepy, almost phallic vibe, and gives your nose plenty of room to breathe . Not so great for dancing close to your partner or whispering sweet nothing in her ear. Also, forget about drinking anything without a straw, unless you want to lift the mask every time you take a drink.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed. It is of a high quality and pretty but just too uncomfortable to wear for a whole evening. It might work well if you have a colossal or weird-shaped head, so if that's you, pop in in your cart. Otherwise, it's great for a photo op but too uncomfortable to wear.
B007VEENEW|2|Bought 8-10 for my 5 year old but the tights will not go up. Since I had no alternative she had to wear them with the crotch almost to her knees. This is the first time buying this brand and it's certainly the last.
B00817DZWO|4|they are what I expected
B000AFABRM|5|This is a very high quality t-shirt, so don't be fooled by the price. The \\"EMS Emergency Medical Services\\" is printed on both the front and back. The blue shirt has a nice contrast with the yellow lettering, and will probably go with any EMT pants or everyday jeans. I'm a female and this shirt fits me quite nicely. I think maybe it should be considered a \\"slim-fit\\" shirt. My Ambulance corps. doesn't let me wear it for my shift because it's generic and doesn't have my town insignia on it, so I wear it for training.     Just remember that if you are wearing this shirt off-duty and there is an emergency you are required to help! If you don't have any EMS/First-Aid/CPR training DON'T wear it in public!
B00OPTFO6C|5|Thank you for my order. Received my order in two days and fits the way I expected! Will definitely recommend you to friends!!! Happy happy customer!
B0093XMAYE|5|Though I'm a woman and this is a guys shirt - I bought one for myself.  I lift weights and have several compression shirts.  This is super soft and comfortable - but pretty thin.  If looking at it for the pure asthetics, it's great.  Really nice top with a very nice fit.  However, if looking for a true compression top... one needs look elsewhere.  THIN material and no support whatsoever.  That being said, I'm ordering another cause it is really flattering if you have muscle definition and like to show it.  For those who lift - you know what I mean!  Great for either gender!
B00NTXL1WQ|5|I'm 6ft 250 flat stomach and I got label size xxxxl (2xl us) fits like a charm. If any guys are reading this and are in my height/weight range label xxxxl (2xl us) is perfect but if u have somewhat of a gut/belly I would go one more size up xxxxxl (3xl us). It also shipped with amazon prime so I was able to get my peacoat in 2 business days! NYC is getting cold now thank God!
B007AK1LW4|5|So cute and fun.  I receive a lot of compliments on them.  Don't buy if you have larger calves, though.  I had to cut the elastic under my cape to get them to fit me.  lol
B00I1AW00E|5|Loved this! My twelve year old is going into eighth grade and she loves it.
B00X5LOHQ4|2|This dress looks sexy in the picture but in real life, the pieces that fall across the shoulder are anything but sexy.  They just look like a small afterthought on an unflattering dress (bust had a lot of coverage even for my enormous chest) and the seams in the front looked off as well.
B00PVBOSWY|5|soft and cozy.  I got many compliments when I wore them to work.
B00KGOEID0|5|These fit perfectly on my 18 month old, he's a big boy at 18 months so I got the 24 months size and thankfully Carter's clothes are roomy.
B004D6FKJ8|5|I have bought 2other pair and these are by far the best fitting. They are longer and have nice stitching.  Easy to put on and boy do they work!
B00553XKBI|5|Love they way this fits, thinking of getting a few more..
B00IMWX9SS|5|My girls love their new swim suits.  The fit perfectly.
B00CEH29RO|5|Where did all the XL tall shirts go?!?! Hanes sucks!!!
B00CHNNHFI|3|The ear flaps wouldn't remain close to the ears and they bowed out making it worse. This hat needs strings.
B00CZ580UA|5|Hx
B00457WW4G|5|I ordered these for my daughter while she was in hospital after having c-section. They arrived the day she went home. She says they fit well and she loves them. I like the affordability!
B00PKOWOE6|5|Love these and the material is somewhat silky so it did not cling to my skirt!
B00GPFS94S|4|I ordered a 5xl based on the reviews.  I normally use a 2xl, and the 5x was way to big.  I ordered another in 3xl.  The 3xl fits great, the leather on the 3xl was softer than the 5xl and some of the seems were stitched differently.  5x seems stronger and thicker, the 3x feels softer and more smooshy (yep I used the word smooshy).  Both coats came quite quickly and undamaged, however the 5x was in a clear plastic bag with paper wraps on the buttons.  The 3x came in a black bag with no wraps, making me think it was a return.  Im 6 feet and about 250 with a 40 waist, there is room for more tummy room on the 3x.  I can put the 3x on and the 5x over it without forcing the sleeves or stretching the front to cover, that is how big the 5x is..good luck
B000NGIOGI|5|I've been wearing support hose a long time and I have never had hose make my feet feel so good! The hose are nice and snug, like you want. They stay up. They are long enough and go to the top of my thigh. Will be reordering.
B00F6J7H7O|5|I like this wallet. The construction is good and the leather is nice. My Driver's license slides smoothly in and out of the Window ID. My VA ID, Grocery card and credit cards fit snugly in the credit card slots. Also, the wallet looks classy. I highly recommend this wallet.
B00CBEMRPO|5|Perfect size, good quality/cost ratio. I'd definitely recommend it
B003ZDNWHW|5|I purchased these socks for my grandson and they fit him perfectly! Nice quality, packaged with care, fast shipping, highly recommended, thank you!
B00VR8WHIC|5|This is my new to go to dress! Wore it on two occasions - a music festival and at a night club!
B00IA4ZCW4|5|Great for my 2.5 year old. Only thing I noticed was slightly tight around wrists which is fine for now but wondering as my daughter grows if she can squeeze her hand in
B007PXVAJK|5|I love Russell shorts.  I had a pair before and could not find them anywhere here.  I was very happy that they had them online.<br />I love how they fit and they are very comfortable.  Good quality fabric that washes well. I will be buying these again.
B003TV465M|5|This was a 'next size up' purchase for my daughter, the originals purchased on a holiday trip to the states.  My daughter is a petite 12 year old but has exceptionally long legs, we have trouble purchasing jeans to fit her in the UK, generally waist sizes are too big or if we manage to find something that fits her small frame the length of leg is snapping around the calf area.  These jeans though expensive, are worth the extra cost as Guess seem to be one of the few that cater for the slim waisted, long legged child along with the more standard size child.  The benefit of purchasing from the US is that even with postage charges the product is still a good £20 cheaper than purchasing here in the UK - and that is if you can find this product anyway.
B0098PLTMQ|4|Not sure of my size, with 1X unavailable in the blue, I ordered the 2X. It is snug in the chest and arms with extra room in the waist. The waist doesn't look big, but it would look better a little more pulled in. Even wearing a waist-nipper made no difference.  The dress is stretchy and is a pull-over. The hem appears a bit uneven because the dress shifts due to the stretch. I am 5'6\\", and the hem was at the bottom of my knee--perfect. The color, which is actually a teal, is stunning. All in all, a pretty dress which, for me, would do nicely in black as well.
B00IO8C1GG|3|Super cute but it is a little more &#34;snug&#34; than I like even though I bought a size bigger than my nephew is.
B0085JHW3G|3|I thought these were very cute but they were so small! I bought these in the size 3m for a new born and were too small. I think they would only fit a premie. The company really needs to change their sizing. I got the color Chocolate and it was more of an orange type brown that I didn't really love. I will probably order the Brown color in a bigger size.
B00L7RW7P6|5|My son had been wanting this shirt in this exact color forever. He was so happy to finally get this shirt, I was happy to find it here at a great savings.
B00JDVHI5M|3|The shirt looks exactly as the picture depicts, However, the material is thin and makes me wonder at the durability of the garment. But for a casual summer outfit for the price is somewhat acceptable. I will probably buy another one , but in the next size up,,, runs a bit small.
B0006FQYSG|5|This happened to be the second order of this black belt.  I ordered one for my son and then my husband liked it so much, I bought as second one.
B00LLIVQM6|5|this cincher is awesome i had the &#34;cherry&#34; brand in 38 and loved it but it got big really quick so i started looking for another and came across this beauty! it has the couture shape its durable and it sucks you in real good for the coke bottle look i got mine in a 34 and i thought i would need at least a 36 but its perfect i just hate the back fat it gives if only they had the vest...........
B002IF5PYQ|3|I love the costume but the sizes run much smaller! I had to return mine for a bigger size made me feel fat lol other than that it was a good prize. I will def. purchase from here again nxt yr.
B00C5CJK1G|5|Great and extremely comfortable shorts. Good for everyday wear and have a nice elastic and drawstring for a better fit.
B00558YVV6|5|the dress is perfect, exactly what it looks like... I look forward to being the envy of the company Christmas party!!!
B00HAX7CGU|4|Very very small if anyone do order these order them in the next size to the real size your baby wears
B00CA6FFKC|5|Cutest costume ever! Very good quality. My son is still wearing it around the house and it's still in good shape.
B004OA7A96|5|This coat is adorable, it fits my 36 inch tall 23 month old with lots of room to grow.
B006ND6FLQ|4|These fit kinda tight and the hair comes loose without doing anything to it.  Just walking shakes it loose. ok.
B00B9J6KA0|4|It fit a little to tight in the tank part, but that could be my fault for ordering that size. Unique design and makes me feel real sexy when wearing it. I would order from this company again.
B00JC3KZFQ|5|Very good, is not to put too much money
B00GRIS4RK|4|Wife love it uses this at her work.
B00B9AVXVK|5|It runs somewhat large for an average baby, but was great for our tall child. :) It's not super warm, so she didn't sweat in it when in the car or a store, but warm enough for the time she spent outside. Two zippers are AWESOME, all suits should have them! :D Washed it several times, holds up well, nothing came apart, colours didn't fade. Very happy with the purchase and would recommend.
B003FSSP8I|4|shirt for superhero based wedding photo
B00ARY0VT4|2|Website described the dress as 100% of cotton, but it actually only has 60% cotton. The description should be changed, as some of us only buy 100% cotton cloth for kids.
B00DPU5ENK|5|The dress fits great.  The color is spectacular!  I'm going to wear it as a bridesmaid dress for a beach wedding.
B002I01YOG|5|My granddaughter LOVES her new bathrobe!  It's a very high quality, extremely soft plush bathrobe, beautifully appliqued with quality stitching and fabric.  It's everything I was hoping it to be!
B00D3ESDRC|1|I was hoping the red would be more dark and deep like it is in the picture. The red is extremely bright and the fabric feels more like a costume than an actual hoodie. As for the sizing, I ordered a medium since I'm thin. The size said it was an American small but it's more like an American medium. It's not bad. I'm sure people will like it. It's just not what I was hoping for.
B00LP8HRKM|3|I ordered a Medium and the straps are long so most of my side boob is out and not in a flattering way. Not good for big boobs or if you require a bra at all
B005YV83NQ|5|Love it
B00E0KETUS|2|It wasn't as I was lead to believe.  It fit horribly.....
B0016NCZ1C|5|Ordered the corset and 3 days later it arrived. I was stunned by how much prettier it was in person then in the picture (and don't get me wrong I like the picture). It's well constructed and fits perfectly. If you follow there sizing chart I think you'll be impressed at how well it fits. All in all Totally worth the money! Another friend bought a different one from the same company and is in love with hers as well.
B007XDPHHI|5|Freaking awesome gloves, I was the envy of the work crew as we transplanted organic vegetable plants covered in fish emulsion into wet dirt in the snow. Everyone else's hands went numb, but not mine!
B007ZYJQ36|4|Fits great. Looks cute
B00UYY4KSK|4|Not the color i expected
B00B4EQB9A|4|I normally use 4/6 size, this time I bought M size and is a little big, but good quality
B00DQYXDWO|5|Just what I expected, great quality and size that just fits me.
B00P2WFWEU|5|Love it. It fits perfectly and the inside is fleece so it's very soft and warm. Love the logo as well, any X-Files fan would love this.
B00KFC09MM|3|Too small
B00062NHH0|5|Good quality and fit as expected. Very nice shirts for the price.
B00MNGK5QS|2|So pretty and I will never get to wear it. :(  It's like it is child sized instead of women's.
B00UXZM22G|5|Very pretty shirt and comfortable.  When I received the shirt it was very large on me so I was kind of disappointed, but after laundering  and drying it in the dryer (on medium heat) it did size itself down a bit so keep that in mind.  But now it fits just the way I like it ... roomy and free flowing without being overwhelming.  I have laundered this shirt quite a few more times now, always in cold water and then hang to dry and I have not noticed any additional shrinkage with it.  All in all a very cute, comfy shirt for the summer.
