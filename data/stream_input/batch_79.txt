B000002UAR|5.0|i must say, i am a fairly gargantuan enjoyer of music that has been produced by the group known as the &quot;beatles&quot; however most of their albums are spotty affairs that contain some crud in between the good  tracks, but thats OK, because REVOLVER is  a truly flawless record, as  every song is scrumdidlyumptiosly fantasmatically pretty good, it is their  magnum opus as they say, i cant pick a  favorite due to the fact that (see  what i said above), please get this and angel dust by fnm or i  will blow  your head off, har har har har har, he he he, happy 4/20 my friends
B00000099Y|5.0|Firstly, this is a remarkable album, certainly one of the best of the decade.<br />For all potential buyers, don't be too put off by what people have said about the six intermission tracks. Two of them, &quot;Message to  Harry Manback&quot; and &quot;ions(-)&quot; are fairly annoying and I often  end up skipping them. The rest are all inoffensive. &quot;Useful  Idiot&quot; is too short to irritate and &quot;Intermission&quot; is a  clever intro to the beautiful &quot;Jimmy&quot;. &quot;Dier Eir von  Satan&quot; serves the same purpose on Aenima as &quot;Disgustipated&quot;  did on Undertow (happily, it does not include seven minutes of cricket  noises). &quot;Cesaro Summability&quot;, with it's distorted infant cries,  is one of the album's most startling moments, and seems quite appropriate.  The nine &quot;songs of substance&quot; comprise 90% of the album's 78  minutes, and they are all uniquely excellent; there is no filler  here.<br />Looking forward to A Perfect Circle! I've downloaded the mp3 of  &quot;Orestes&quot;, and it's quite amazing. Like Tool, but more...  organic.
0792836634|5.0|child's play is a comedy horror,it's quite short but extreamly good,it's a film everybody should have on video{espeacily mad people}
6302649943|4.0|The movie is pretty good.  It has some pretty good scenes and the actor who plays IT does a good job.   Compared to the book, the movie over does the clown.  In the movie IT always appears as the clown or changes to the  clown soon after.  In the book IT appears in about 20 different forms.  The  actor who plays Bill is terrible.  The book is mostly what happens when  they are kids, and the movie is the opposite. Please read the book first.
0843175028|5.0|This is a great book for a child at Christmas time.  I purchased it for my son in the spring, and after reading it once, I think that this would be a good book to put away until Christmas.<br />Mr. Snow is a snowman that Santa  brings to life with magic.  Mr. Snow helps Santa in delivering all of the  presents to all of the boys and girls.<br />This is probably the best Mr. Men  book to get at Christmas time, but I wouldn't recommend it in the summer.
0780625129|5.0|I saw this film last year. I wrote a review to say how much I loved it. At the end of the review I put that I thought Norton's character needed more redemption. However watching again made me realize, it's just right. His  character is so believable. If the change had been too sudden, it wouldn't  have been. I had a video night last night and we watched the film, now most  of my friends are going to buy it. I think its's wonderful, so deep and  touching. The film has so many levels. It is visually stunning.
6302256615|4.0|a classic film,with a cop undercover investigating a butch of bank robbers calling themselves the ex presidents,this film is almost two hours long,if you like this you would like heat,reservoir dogs and speed.The problem with this film is that it has the typical story of a undercover cop,but its good  points are that it has surfing and sky jumping witch makes it more  intresting keanu reeves plays his best performance .This film is worth to  have on video and is a great film for a  collection.
B00004NRWH|5.0|I just checked these guys out live....INCREDIBLE show!  They opened for 3 Doors Down.  I was very impressed with the show.  Awesome awesome guys.  Pick up the CD...It's definitley one everyone should have in their  collection!  Nickelback ROCKS!
0375707972|3.0|I agree with the masses that this was a good read, it did have twists and turns, but still worth it. Unlike many, I did have compassion for Michael. He was stripped of his innocense at such a young age. This, I feel, set the  stage of aloofness and depression that seemed to consume him throughout the  rest of the book. Of course, he was interested in sex.. he was 15, but he  was taken advantage of by the older woman in a very sick way. This odd  obsessive love affair affected his every relationship; from his father to  other females his own age.  Hanna was his teacher in the beginning of the  novel and later you see Michael become her teacher. Hanna taught him about  passion, however warped it was. Then in the end you see that he taught her  literacy and kindness. I would not rank this book very high with other  stories of the Holocaust, but i think the story is a good one. I considered  it more a focus on Michael as the Reader... her Reader.
B000006I14|5.0|Well, this is probably the first real horror movie classic, and it's still better than the majority of the 90's films!  Look at the genious camerascenes and ...well everything!  It is genious!
B00003CWOL|5.0|I have long been a huge Kevin Smith fan therefore I may have somewhat of a bias opinion but I still know good movie making when I see it. This movie revolutionizes the intelligent comedy with witty dialect and an original  outlook on religion.  If you've seen any other Smith films you'll  understand the slap stick humor and welcome Jay(Jason Mews) and Silent  Bobs(Smith himself) excellent performances.  This is at very least a  definite rental.  To Kevin Smith fans its a must buy dvd.
6305265488|5.0|To let you know how much I like this film, I am on my second copy.  I have worn the first one out watching it so much.  When asked to describe the film, I simply say &quot;Cinderella, without the fairy god mother and  pumpkin&quot;.  I love the soundtrack for this film.  I don't have to see  the picture on the tube, because I can tell what is happening by the  music.<br />I also like the fact that the film goes one step beyond the  traditional story.  I always wondered what became of the stepmother and  stepsisters.  Now I know, and it goes beyond my imagination.<br />If you are  looking for a movie that everyone in the family can watch, this is it.  There's sword fighting, intrigue, tenderness and advice that works in the  21st century as well as it would have in the 16th.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I think that Blink-182 is an awsome band! The cd Enema of the State is a very good. I am a huge fan of the band. However, my parents are thinking about not letting me buy the cd becuase of the cover and the lyrics. The  thing I like about the band is that they show that they are not always  serious when they use foul language. It is a really good cd and my parents  say that I can get  it as long as they dont have to listen to it. They are  a awsome band and you will be happy once you buy the cd!
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger is one of those rare books that introduces a character that you both despise and sympathise with. It is not long, it is not boring, and it is full of meaning. Read it and learn something about people, and about  yourself. We are all strangers. Don't be afraid to find out why.
B00000JZIK|5.0|One of the best peices of cinema to ever grace the silver screen. The twists and turns of the tale leave thinking you have a few of the answers but knowing that you don't have anywhere near all of them. Little can be  said to anyone who has not yet seen this film exept DO SO NOW!.
B0000256VK|5.0|This masterpiece was Roxy Music's finest hour.  Just superb!   It will lose you in a sea of lush musical landscapes.  Totally unique and wonderful!  Am I glowing enough?  I'm British, Scottish actually, and  remember growing up with these guys - I guess they weren't too big in the  States - a real pity as a lot of people missed out on some of the finest  music ever recorded.  Even today it still sounds like it was recorded  yesterday.  No need to single out specific tracks - they are all great, but  more so than individually, it ALL works as a album.  Enjoy!   This is the  one to take to a desert island!
0792835719|4.0|A great film with elements of action and in depth story lead to a well crafted peice of cinema. The only real drawback to the experience id that you spend the entire film waiting for Lesley Neilson to deliver a punchline  that you subconsiously know is never coming.
6305538018|3.0|One thing I've noticed about viewers' reactions to this film is that most people seem to have either loved it or hated it - strange, considering that the thing with eXistenZ is that it delivers exactly what you expect it to  ... and no more.<br /> I'm still not quite sure as to what to think about this  film: still &quot;digesting&quot; it (without wanting to incur visions of  that &quot;yummy&quot; Chinese special .. ). The way the film shows the  confusion between reality and virtual reality is effective, if not  immediately obvious. However, the story just never seems to hang together  as a whole; a tighter structure might paradoxically have allowed a more  open, more disturbing interpretation of this vision of the future. As it  is, eXistenZ is interesting enough in itself; but, ironically, I never  managed to fully immerse myself in the strange new world created for us.<br />  I guess that the reason I'm so confused about this film is because, as  others have said, you're never sure whether you're judging the movie or the  game. Perhaps the strangely claustrophobic feel of this film is deliberate:  eXistenZ and later tranCendenZ open up whole new worlds for the characters,  but also isolate them because they're never sure what to trust. <br /> Not  sure about the acting either: Jennifer Jason Leigh is good, but not  entirely convincing; Jude Law is low-key (but still gorgeous!), sometimes a  little too much so. However ... like with the main story ...<br /> ... the  problem is deciding whether that's deliberate or not. The reason I have  rated this movie at 3 stars (which for me is a &quot;good&quot;) is because  David Cronenberg appears to have done what he set out to do: make you  unsure about the difference between reality and fantasy. <br /> eXistenZ  delivers what you eXpeCt it to (sorry!), and then it truly does leave you  to make up your own mind .... about the implications of the story, and  about the manner in which it is presented.
6304474652|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was at a friends house. I asked her if I could borrow it, brought it home and watched it again. The next day I went out and bought my own copy. While it isn't the most realistic movie ever  made, it isn't meant to be taken too seriously. I recommend this movie for  anyone- men or women. My 21 year old brother and his friends come into my  room whenever I am watching it. This movie is definitely in my top ten.
B00000637V|5.0|oh boy, this is depressing stuff.  but it's brilliant.  i think it has to do with a drug-addicted socialite, but i could be wrong.  doesn't matter.  all that does matter is the quality of songs like &quot;caroline  says&quot;, &quot;oh jim&quot;, &quot;lady day&quot;, and all the others.  this album is the opposite of prozac, but you still gotta pop it....

0446525537|5.0|This book is great!  I can sort of relate to it, I'm about thesame age as Landon.  I don't know, it just moved me. I actually criedat the end! When you read A Walk to Remember, you remember how it felt in this situation.  It has so many aspects to it, that a lot of books don't have.  I've never read one of Nicholas Sparks' books, but I'm interested in reading one now.  The emotions that are expressed in this book, though they occured long ago don't change.  I felt connected to it somehow.  I strongly recommmend it!

B000002UJQ|5.0|I'm so sick of this CD, but damn it, I can't stop listening to it. Its composition is haunting and its performance is exquisite. It's as if Brian Eno and REM had a child in 1987 named it Radiohead.<br />I originally DL the  entire CD on MP3 by mistake only eventually to buy a CD for the car and the  home hi-fi.
0783226837|4.0|Well...the idea of the movie is...uh...well STUPID! But it is not that bad actually, It is very funny and Kevin Bacon is...oh...soo sexy. if you want to see a movie who's scary, find another one, but if you want a funny ( And  a little bit creepy ) one, I highly recommend it!
B00000BKDW|5.0|For Me, this is the pinnacle of Maiden's success recording. This has the classic lineup and is over one hour of incredible music. From the beginning with &quot;Aces High&quot; to the epic &quot;Rime of the Ancient  Mariner&quot; this album packs more quality riffs into 8 songs than many  bands do in a lifetime. The production is excellent, the songwriting top  notch and the song selection is great. Adrian and Dave are in excellent  form showing us why they re-defined the twin lead guitar format. In my  opinion, the title track rates as one of the bands best songs ever, Dave  Murray has 2 of his best solos ever in that one. The band shows why they  were at the top of the Hard Rock/Metal scene at the time and this album  still rocks today as much as it did then. If you like metal and you don't  own this album I highly recommend that you get this one and play it loud.
6305546789|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I was home alone with all the lights off, and Yes! I was scared to death all the way. This is the scariest movie I've ever seen, if you have'nt seen it, do it now! ( But be sure to have all the  lights off, and a big bowl of popcorn by your side )

0792156684|2.0|OK, first of all I don't understand why this movie got so much attention, I mean, at the cinema it was like... Oh.. wow... great... stunning, but when I watched it at home, it was not as fantastic as I remembered it  being, in fact, I am now ashamed that I actually have it! Kate Winslet is a  really fabulous actress and she does a fantastic job, but... no this movie  is NOT something I would have recommended. If you want a STUNNING film, a  romantic film, I highly recommend &quot;A room with a view&quot;, it is  simply stunning!
0790743132|5.0|I was introduced to this movie in the greatest &quot;gut class&quot; in the history of American higher education.  It was screened in a class called &quot;World War II on Film&quot;, at S.M.U., and made my college education complete.  There is a reason it makes virtually every &quot;best&quot; film list.  There has never been a better movie.  Nothing can be done to improve upon it (except cutting the line where Ilsa describes Sam as &quot;The boy playing the piano&quot;).<br />So much of this movie has become classic.  It may be because of the lines, like &quot;Here's looking at you kid&quot;, or &quot;This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship&quot;.  Has there ever been a retort like Rick saying to Major Strasser &quot;There are parts of New York I would advise you not to invade&quot;?  Casablanca of full of these bon mots. <br />It may be because of the music, like &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;.  I may love this country, but there is no anthem like &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, and seeing and hearing this played in Rick's makes the little hair I have left stand on end.  It may be the most stirring affirmation of indominitable strength in a movie ever.  No wonder the Nazis sat down.<br />It may be the classic moments.  Like the flashback to Rick and Ilsa dancing in La Belle Aurore.  Or Rick and Captain Renault having a chat about women becoming scarce, and how Rick should not cast them aside so cavalierly.  Or the hope of the Bulgarian couple who would risk all to have their children born free; him gambling badly and her willing to submit to Captain Renault.  Or Victor Lazlo leading the whole house in singing.<br />Casablanca is a testimony to love, and hope, and nobility.  If I were Mr. T, I would say &quot;I pity the fool&quot; who is not touched by this movie.  Those woeful individuals have never had love, lost love and recaptured it.  Too bad for them. The rest of us lucky ones can relish these feelings as time goes by.

B000002U82|4.0|THE greatest album ever?  No.  One of the greatest?  Definitely.  Advice...to really appreciate it, this must be played only through a high performance sound system.
B000002GLV|5.0|I have listened to this album thousands of times since 8 years old in 70's and I never get tired or boring what ever ....of it. I'll always have this (record, cassette and CD) in my collection. Highly recommended (i think the  sound of the record much better than CD) This very superb album of century  i ever heard, with all musician have a high energy improvising fused blues  with jazz. What a GOOD or GOD musician...?

630575067X|5.0|I don't know why people think that the phantom menace is the wost starwars movie ever.   I thank people didn't understand the movie.  You see people, this movie tells how the starwars saga begins.   When the two other  starwars movies comes out, I think the people will understand the phantom  menace.<br />P.S. I did't think Jar Jar was gay
B00004R99J|5.0|i dont know about some of you people out there criticizing this movie?  i mean this movie shows love between two very different cultures.they fall in love almost immediatly which in our day would be very strange.i mean this  movie is very inspiritaional  and spirited.it may have been a ledgend but  puts the true meaning of love a frist site. i would reccommend this movie  to anyone.
B000002AP1|3.0|Raw Power is mentioned by almost everyone who proclaims to be a music critic to be a seminal album of the genre.  And in alotta ways I have to agree.  But this album has never really been accessable to the average rock  and roll fan.  Most people have never heard about it, and their lives have  gone on normally for years, so its hard to label this as  &quot;essential&quot;.  This album starts out very strong with &quot;Gimme  Danger &quot; and &quot;Search and Destroy&quot;.  What irks me about this  though, is that even with the remastered version, this is a very muddy  sounding album.  You can only brighten up a flatulant recording job so  much.  As one of the previous reviewers says, this album begs to be  cranked.  But if you do, I'm not sure if either your equipment or ears will  survive.  That's why I give this 3 stars -- great material, but the mike  was left in the men's room during the recording session.
0312853238|5.0|Ender's Game is Card's most popular book. I've read many of them and I believe this and it's sequel may be Card's crowning achievements. This one will keep you up late with stinging eyes, and you will not be able to put  it down. This is a must read; it's good the second and third time too.  You'll love this book.
B000000I0H|4.0|Incantations is a very special piece of work.  It is quintessential Mike Oldfield.  Hard not to love.    But the CD release is flawed.  About a minute from the beginning of track 3 (or 2?) has been hacked off so that  the original four sides of the two-album set can be squeezed onto one  CD.    If you have the original vinyl release, you'll be able to compare.   On the CD, the track \\"fades in\\" but this is to conceal the fact  that about a minute or more of the original recording has been omitted from  the CD.    If it were not for this very serious shortcoming of the CD, I  would recommend it highly.
B000002MIY|5.0|This is truly a masterpiece. There is not a cut that isn't brilliant! The ones to receive most airplay are &quot;Snowbound&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow's Girls&quot;, however do yourself a favor and wear out &quot;Teahouse on The  Tracks&quot; and perhaps the best cut on the album, &quot;Florida  Room&quot;! This says Donald Fagen, but it is classic Steely Dan! A  &quot;steam-powered TEN&quot;!
B000002L75|5.0|The Amazon reviewer seems to be reviewing this album after the fact. Yes, relative to how everyone sees things today some of Depeche Mode's songs are eyerollers. I will argue that when this and other DM albums came out they  meant quite a bit to me. Quite a bit. If you are interested in DM this is a  great CD to get although I would argue that Construction Time Again was the  launch of the post Vince Clark era. Their most commercial and viable album  songwriting-wise is Violator, which I also really like. The thing is each  album is a step, if you enjoy the journey of Depeche Mode you'll like each  one for different reasons. They aren't the best or the worst but they are  on my list and that's what I care about.
630575067X|5.0|Knowing what is said about TPM, I personally found the movie breathtaking...the lightsaber duels were soooo good, I was completely swept away...I didn't much like Anakin, but thought Yoda, Jar-Jar, Amidala and,  of course, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon were fantastic...there was a host of  wonderful actors who, though they had little to say, brought life to the  characters. No need to talk about how stunning the special effects were -  this is Star Wars after all :-D

B00003CX6P|5.0|Highsmith's characters are one-dimentional and flat.  Minghella brings forth new light and beauty into the world of Dickie Greenleaf and Tom Ripley.  Minghella adds new characters that make the plot more involved and  inspiring, while Highsmith's Ripley drags on without much plot.  Minghella  takes Highsmith's most engaging and wonderous character and makes it go,  while Highsmith's world of Ripley sat dead in the water.  (No pun intended)   This is one of the few cases where the movie is better than the book.   Make Ripley work for you, in the vivid and alive version of the story.
B000000OPU|5.0|While it may not be Gabriel's best album (which I believe to be his third, self-titled album), it is definitely a better introduction to his music.  It may be more pop-oriented than his other albums, but it's still one of  the best albums of the 80's.  \\"Red Rain,\\"  \\"Sledgehammer,\\" \\"Mercy Street,\\" \\"Don't Give  Up,\\" \\"Big Time,\\" and \\"In Your Eyes\\" are all  stand-outs, particularly \\"In Your Eyes,\\" which is probably his  best known song thanks to the film, \\"Say Anything.\\"  Gabriel  combines elements of minimalism, world music, and for the first time,  Memphis soul, to create some very compelling, very entertaining music.  At  times, like \\"Mercy Street,\\" it floats, sounding very low-key and  textured without descending into boring mood music, and other times, like  \\"Big Time,\\" it's a thumping, muscular sound that you can dance  to.     Now, you can divide Gabriel's fans into two categories: those who  love \\"Sledgehammer\\" and those who hate it.  It may not be typical of his music, but the Memphis Horns play some nice charts, and the double-entendres are a rare display of humor. Regardless of whether you like it or not, there's something for everyone on this album, so even if you think  \\"Sledgehammer\\" comes on too strong, you may enjoy something like \\"Don't Give Up,\\" which is another great single, every bit as uplifting as \\"Solsbury Hill.\\"
0790732254|5.0|What lies beneath the surface? under the pleasantries, the luncheons, the handshakes, the idle gossip? Dysfunction, loathing, love, infidelity and lots of drinking. Taylor and Burton are superb and Sany Dennis give a  performance second only to the one she gave in the out of towners. Often  funny , always disturbing, watch it again and again.
B000002U8G|5.0|Though not a true anagram for the Pink Floyd Masterpiece, it is one of the millions of conclusions your mind may draw while partaking in the sonic journey that is ECHOES.......<br />Echoes, the final song on Meddle, is the  defining piece of all that is, whas, or ever could be Pink Floyd.  No other  compostion by this phenomenal band, or any other group of musicians for  that matter, is able to expand one's mind quite like this.  I will not  analyze the piece for you, for it is something that must be experienced  (and if you ever consider trying a hallucinogen, make this a mandatory  accessorie to acompany you in the trip)  <br />This song will not alter your  perception, but create a new perception entirely.<br />&quot;Strangers Passing  in the street By chance two seperate glances meet And I am you but what I  see is me&quot;
B000002KO1|5.0|The Pretenders' self titled debut album from 1980 is my favorite debut album in all of rock, and one of my five favorite rock albums of all time. Combining elements of punk with her own brand of &quot;tough girl&quot;  attitude, Chrissie Hynde, on this album, has done more to advance feminism  and equality of the sexes than any other release in rock history. Chrissie  Hynde somehow manages to be both tough and tender on the same album. When  she's angry, she's really angry, and not afraid to let you know it. But  there's also a very soft, tender, sensitive side to this music as well.  This album stands up extremely well after two decades. It is an essential  part of any good collection of rock music.
0783232039|2.0|Was this supposed to be a Horror Movie?  I found it to be more comedic.  That is one problem with horror sequels.  The killer become Comedians.  Freddy, Chucky, Etc.I hate that.  They are violent, demonic, psychotic.   Let them be that.  This movie had not reason to be made.  Chucky was killed  3 previous times.  The first should have been it.  No more.  Unforutnatly,  this movie threatens to bring another sequel.  The Son of Chucky...It's  coming, I'm sure.......very bland, but colorful, and funny, but i don't  watch chucky to laugh
B000002MNL|5.0|One of his best, I never grow tired of this deeply moving album. Musically a step in a new direction, each track on this effort contains the typical rant, yet the poetry here is the most thought provoking and intensely  moving ever. The best track, I Am Hated for Loving, seems unappealing on  the surface, but listen closely to the words and the compositon of the song  and anyone who has ever experienced forbidden or unrequited love will  appreciate it. Incredibly brooding, yet proud. The man's a genius.

B00000J2KX|5.0|This is my favorite Kubrick film to watch because it is his most  &quot;extreme&quot;- in language, violence, and subject matter.What makes  this movie so much better than all other war movies is the fact that it  doesnt concentrate on one facet of war, such as a battle, man or mission.  It focuses on the complete process of dehumanization of men in war.From  drilling it into their heads in basic training, to &quot;pacifist&quot;  Joker wasting the sniper, and thus, completing the process.Kubrick really  seems to capture the essence of men in the Vietnam War. Commanders only  intent on creating killing machines, soldiers simply killing for amusement,  and no one thinking of the consequences for anyone. I've read a lot of  criticism of the second half of this movie-the battle scenes-for being  boring(compared to the first half) and unrealistic. I feel I must point out  that the first half is so savagely brutal that the revelation of the  meaning of life would probably  be a letdown. As for it being unrealistic,  Vietnam is not just one big jungle, and war is not made up simply of planes  flying overhead and bombs being dropped. These scenes, I feel, capture the  isolation and  sense of terror  in being in a situation in which you have  little or no control, and can be killed at any moment. I hope that those of  you who don't lile the second half will go back and rewatch it. It is  certainly worth the extra effort, for it is what makes the film a classic.
0783225733|5.0|Apollo 13 might be not just one of the best movie I've ever seen, but the spectacular sound of the DVD is terrific. The lauch sequence is so intense with the Dolby Digital 5.1 that it woke up my neighbours one night(SORRY)!  Everyone must have this movie on DVD
B00000J2KT|5.0|This is my favorite Kubrick film to watch because it is his most &quot;extreme&quot;- in language, violence, and subject matter.What makes this movie so much better than all other war movies is the fact that it doesnt concentrate on one facet of war, such as a battle, man or mission.  It focuses on the complete process of dehumanization of men in war.From  drilling it into their heads in basic training, to &quot;pacifist&quot;  Joker wasting the sniper, and thus, completing the process.Kubrick really  seems to capture the essence of men in the Vietnam War.

B000000OA6|5.0|Hearing this record, knowing today what condition Freddie was in at the time, is a soul stirring experience to say the least. Of course, no one but Freddie himself really knew what was happening at the time with his  illness. The band knew he was weak, but they did not know the whole truth  of his condition. Still, there was an unspoken sense of urgency among the  band during the making of this record. The emotions expressed with his  voice just drip with poignancy and immediacy. It is astonishing to me how  someone who was so weak and fragile at the time could conjure up such  power, evoke such unearthly sounds from his frail body. Evidently, the band  had to keep stopping after one or two vocal takes by Freddie, because he  would get very weak and need to take breaks. But he kept working throughout  the sessions. Freddie was truly fighting for his life, and he gives this  performance every last ounce of energy that he could produce. This album  proves once and for all, if there was ever any doubt, that the strength of  the fighting human spirit is more powerful than the physical body! Freddie,  thank you for proving this to the world. You have triumphed. This is the  voice that shook the world. Heroic. Stunning.
630021463X|5.0|This movie is a smashing hit. The best Trek ever and brings the excitement of traveling through unexplored cosmic mysteries to your living room. The spectacular voyage back in time to 1986 San Francisco to find two humpback  whales and bring them back to 24th century Earth and with a stolen  Bird-of-Prey makes the plot so exciting, need I say more?
0671044508|2.0|Not a great mafia book - I found myself bored at some points.It really was a little boring at times.  For a great mafia book, youcan not go wrong with the Godfather (the only decent Puzo book in my mind.)<br />THe 1st person format I think was a weakpoint in this book
B000002C1W|4.0|Some people seem upset that this isn't like traditional Pink Floyd; that hasn't bothered me, since I just discovered Pink Floyd recently and haven't had time to get used to their &quot;sound&quot;. If you're looking for  something the same as their other albums, this may not be what you want,  but give this album a chance. I've definitely enjoyed it.
B00000K2SC|5.0|This is literaly a perfect movie. Dont listen to anybody else this movie is perfect in everything fights, diolouge, action everthing is great.The Matrix is the best movie ever.
B00000J7J4|1.0|I did not like this CD too much,  It is not anywhere as good as abraxas or any of his other CDs.  I dont think this CD is very good at all,  the songs are all mostly bad.  I would NOT recommend buying this CD, but abraxas is a  old but very good album.
B000002MFF|5.0|I have listened to every song on this cassette and I love every one of them.  I remember Layla (the first version) but never really listened to Clapton's music till now. I've got a lot of lost time to make up for!  By  the way, my brother named his daughter Layla after the song.  GREAT MUSIC!   GIVE ME MORE!
0380804557|4.0|The only surprise I had in reading this novel was that it was the easiest book I'd ever read. If you've encountered Sandman, then you'd probably be more inclined to read it, but still, even without experiencing Sandman,  it's still definitely worthwhile. It may seem that the book is just too  darn short and it seems to lack something. Nevertheless, I do encourage you  to pick it up.
6305750750|5.0|I have to say, I'm the huggest Natalie Portman fan and when I found out that she was going to be playing the role of Queen Amidala, I flipped out!  This movie was outstanding!  I loved it everytime I saw it in theatres!   This movie captured the essence of Star Wars and the special effects made  the film even better!  I just want to say that this movie is well worth  buying because it is part of the legend of Star Wars!  Anyway this is the  video to get!  Buy it now!
6304493681|3.0|An extremely stylish film with great production values, but far too abridged in movie form.  It only runs 78 minutes (a far cry from the 115 minutes listed in the specifications here as of this review!), and the  story's depth and scope suffers quite obviously in its adaptation to this  media because of its relative brevity, equally obviously due to the expense  and effort involved in developing animation of this quality.  One gets the  unavoidable sense that there's an incredible story behind Ghost in the  Shell, easily worth several hours of storytelling, but that its surface is  only barely scratched in this film.  Events happen too quickly, too little  is explained beforehand or afterward, and the final credits start scrolling  before much of real substance has taken place and before the viewer knows  what's really happening.  I consider it really unfortunate; a true  injustice to the story's potential, but unfortunately nothing new to anime  adaptations (see Battle Angel Alita, for another, even better example).   Ultimately, readers of this review will want the answer to one basic  question: is it worth owning?  Sadly, in my view it isn't; while the  audience's glimpse of its beautiful, stylish cyberpunk world is not without  its rewards, it is ultimately too brief and disjointed to have continued  viewing value, especially for those who are not intimately familiar with  the original manga (comic book).  You may, quite reasonably, disagree and  enjoy this film for whatever it does bring to the table, in which case you  would find it worth its purchase price.  If, however, like me, you find  that unfinished potential animation masterpieces like Battle Angel Alita  and Lord of the Rings are more a source of mourning than enjoyment, you'd  do best to steer clear of buying this DVD, and simply rent it.
0790739356|2.0|Soldier has many things going for it which mainly include great special effects, set designs, and talented actors like Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee, and Sean Pertwee.  What it doesn't have is a good plot, script,  execution, or even action for that matter.  The fact is I could have taken  the unoriginal plot if only the film maintained some form of excitement or  tension.  <br />The film does start out promisingly enough with am montage of  Sergeant Todd's (Kurt Russell) life which involves grueling training and  numerous wars (The batte scenes in the montage are fairly unintentionally  humorous since when do soldiers just walk around and fire blindly).  Then  comes the introduction of a new batch of supersoldiers that have come to  replace Todd and his men.    The action sequence that has Russell and two  others fighting Jason Scott Lee on chains high above the ground is an good  one.   It's too bad none of the other ones could measure up to that one.   It's just that I never have found Rambo-type action to be generally good.   It's never suspenseful to watch the hero take down all the badguys with a  lot of ease.<br />Soldier might actually have been better if it didn't take  itself that seriously.  As a matter of fact, if it had also tried to be  humorous it would have been more enjoyable.  In most movies, we tend to  root for heroes because they're charismatic and likeable.  Russell's Todd  is somewhat likeable but there's no charisma.  Every single supporting  actor that receives billing has more dialogue than he does.  The whole  supersoldier plot idea has been used to death and it's done again poorly in  this weak action film.
B00000BKDY|5.0|I remember when I first bought this album;I thought it was amazing. In fact, I listened to the cassette so many times that it wore out. The music and the lyrics on this album are fantastic and rate right up there with the  Powerslave album as one of the all time great Maiden albums.  Every song on  this album is great, and even more than 10 years later they still have the  same energy and enthusiamsm for me as they did when the album was new. A  must have for any true Maiden fan.
B0000039PW|4.0|I'm a west coast fan but i decided to get dis cd and i was pleased by it,itz got good beats,phat lyrics. My fav trackz r juicy,big poppa,unbelievable,gimme the loot, and everyday struggle.

0385474547|5.0|The first book that I have read on Africa that was wrien from the view of an African.  Since this is Achebe's native land he is able to tell the real stroys about the real cultrue, traditions, their way of life and the way  they viewed outsiders.  Know I can relate to what the first slaves brought  to this country must of thought and felt.
0790729989|5.0|One of the most twisted films ever made. It grips you with suspense and pulls you into the action. Seven is certainly a must have on DVD, the clairity and perfection of the picture quality is amazing! My VHS copy of  this movie doesn't compare to it... of course, Seven has always been one of  my all-time favorite movies anyway. The twist in this movie will astound  you, maybe even freak you out completely... it did me! MUST HAVE FOR YOUR  COLLECTION if of you love PITT, SPACEY,  FREEMAN, &amp; PALTROW!  Incredible!
6305750750|1.0|If Jar Jar is in the next movie, I'll only see it if he get beheaded by a light saber. It was sad to see this movie made into nothing but a money making cash cow for George Lucas. The movie wasn't made to be a great  movie, it was made to sell merchandise. I suppose I would have liked it  quite a bit more if I was 6 years old but sadly I'm not. Shame on you  George!
B00003CWQ2|5.0|This is hands-down one one the best of 1999 (along with Election and The Limey). It is also one of the most sophisticated movies to come out of Hollywood in years. In fact, I almost can't understand how the script made  it through the process. I mean it's anarchist, anti-materialistic, and  offers us Meat Loaf with testicular cancer. Oh, and by the way, it doesn't  really have a lot to do with fighting. That's just a, as they say,  vehicle.<br />I can't wait to see it again. I was so blown away the first  time. I only saw it because I happened to be at a mall at the time, and  someone recommended it.<br />I don't want to give anything away. I just want  to point out that is a venomous attack on &quot;the American way&quot;. In  fact, it puts American Beauty to shame.<br />Norton's character is an  existential shell of a man, living in a Pottery Barn apartment, and  spending his free time checking out the self help circuit just to connect  with the outside world.<br />That's until he meets Pitt. A club starts. Guys  fight. There's a machismo factor. That's what may have sold the script,  because after that the film enters the surreal and dangerous ideas surface,  ideas that, gosh, just ain't American.<br />So see this film, then see it  again. All of the acting is phenomenal, including Brad Pitt. It's one of  the few films of our generation that actually challenges the audience. If  the WTO doesn't make it to your city, see Fight Club. It's just as  subversive, but without the teargas.

B00001QGPR|4.0|The Pretty Things appear throughout David Bowie's musical catalogue, first as coquettish young gays in \\"Hunky Dory's\\" \\"Oh, You Pretty Things,\\" then again as a violent sexual object for shaking in \\"Tim Machine's\\" \\"Pretty  Thing.\\"  They're back in \\"hours'\\" best song, \\"Pretty Things Are Going To  Hell.\\"  Bowie here, in the album's only true rock song, is saying, it's all  over, now its time for something else.  Ironically, the something else he  gives us is not as good.  \\"Hours\\" is Bowie light, but even Bowie light is  worthwhile.  \\"What's Really Happening\\" is better than you might think,  considering that its lyrics were partially written by a contestant in a  contest Bowie ran on his web site.  \\"Seven\\" is fairly interesting.   \\"Thursday's Child,\\" while obscure enough to find a home amongst Bowie's  songs, is too slow and too musically derivative.  It's a terrible start to  the album.  Casual Bowie fans may be wondering if his best days are far  behind him.   1995's \\"Outside\\" suggests this is not the case.  While  \\"hours\\" is fair, \\"Outside\\" ranks amongst his best.  If you don't have it,  that album may make for a better choice than \\"hours.\\"
B00000BKDX|5.0|IRON MAIDEN is one of the greatest bands to EVER wear the metal crown!  They were always my favorite to see in concert and this collection is a testament to that fact. Their energy; their musical abilities; the lyrics;  the sense of history in their songs; their humor-I could ramble on and on  about what a fantastic bunch these guys are!  Now that they have reunited  with Mr. Dickinson the world is a slightly better place to be in at this  moment n time.
0451160916|5.0|I read &quot;The Shining&quot; about 1 1/2 years ago, so I don't remember is I wrote a review for this book... I'll write one anyway.<br />This was the first King book I ever read: I was bored one day, and my brother had it  (and had said it was good), so I picked it up and started reading it -- I  hid it under the cover in my room so my parents wouldn't know I was reading  it (I was 12, but I didn't know if they would want me reading such a  book).<br />Well, I eventually had to ask my mom if I could read it, because I  read it SO much it was too hard to keep it out of sight -- of course she  said yes.<br />Although the book had started off a little slow (and although  it was, at the time, hard to understand everything Stephen King said --  &quot;What's a PR smile&quot; I sometimes wondered), I discovered that,  unlike I had thought before, a book didn't need to be exciting THROUGHOUT  THE WHOLE BOOK to be good/well written.  Stephen King did a WONDERFUL job  explaining abou the charactes (I couldn't get enough of &quot;...officious  little prick...&quot;).  I was amazed at how creative he could be (i.e.  Danny's little friend, Tony), and at how much effort could be put into a  single 465-page book! <br />Even if you think the beginning (or should I say  the beginning 2/3 of the book) is too boring, PLEASE finish it out, because  once you do, you'll realize that it was all worth it!<br />((After &quot;The  Shining&quot;, I read 15 other Stephen King books (all incredible),  including (in order) &quot;The Dark Half&quot;*, &quot;'Salem's Lot&quot;,  &quot;It&quot;, &quot;The Stand&quot;*, &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom  Gordon&quot;, &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;*, &quot;Roadwork&quot; (Richard  Bachman), &quot;Hearts In Atlantis&quot;*, &quot;The Dark Tower I, II, and  III: The Gunslinger*, The Drawing of the Three, and The Waste Lands&quot;,  &quot;The Green Mile&quot;*, &quot;The Long Walk&quot; (Richard Bachman),  &quot;The Running Man&quot; (Richard Bachman), and  &quot;Carrie&quot;.))<br />(A * indicates one of my favorite Stpehen King  books.)
B00004LN16|4.0|AC/DC returns, building on the success of &quot;Ballbreaker,&quot; heading back towards what could be a second set of halycon days. They're not quite back to the unbelievable level they existed at from 1977 to 1984, but it's  certainly possible that they could return to those heights once more. It's  not &quot;Back in Black&quot; - but anyone who criticizes it for that  failing can only be ignorant - NOTHING will ever match &quot;Back in  Black,&quot; from this band or any other. Great productions, good riffs,  and Brian's vocals - though not as powerful as the 80-84 period - are far  improved from the previous two albums. My only major criticism must fall  upon the album's lyrics... Since Johnson stopped writing lyrics in '88, the  written side of each album has suffered greatly - but who listens to AC/DC  albums for the lyrics, anyway? &quot;SUL&quot; is an oasis in today's ocean  of mediocre &quot;rap-metal&quot; and sickening &quot;teenage pop&quot; -  if any other band had produced this album, I would've given it 6 stars.  Easily the best since &quot;Fly on the Wall.&quot;
B00000F169|1.0|I could not believe how POOR this film was (UNBELIEVABLY SO - DON'T BUY IT! ).  I can usually tolerate anything, but this was SO BAD that I  fast-forwarded through large portions of it in order to stay awake.  What a  waste .... I would have gotten more pleasure from watching  Chitty-Chitty, Bang-Bang 100 times! .........
B00000IQMT|4.0|All of the tracks are wonderful, especially &quot;Duel of TheFates&quot; The music is wonderful and displays a story in itself.Such as in &quot;Anakin's Theme&quot; the foreshadowing of his transformation into Darth Vader is hinted at by the interwoven &quot;Darth Vader Theme&quot; from the original score.  I would recomend this CD for those who enjoy instrumental music END
0684800713|5.0|Having visited Pamplona during the &quot;Running of the Bulls,&quot; this book has a little more added meaning for me.  Nevertheless, the book should be enjoyed by most everyone who reads it.  Don't buy it looking for action  or adventure, it has very little.  Knowledge of the Spanish countryside  makes the book more enjoyable, but is definitely not a requirement.   Anyway, it is a great story of Jake Barnes, an expatriate of the first  world war, who seemingly just can't catch a break.  He is injured in the  war and is unable to perform sexually because of it.  He is hopelessly in  love with Lady Brett Ashley who is a nymphomaniac, for lack of a better  term.  he seems all alone because he can never have the one he loves and he  struggles to find a meaning to all this nonsense happening around him.  In  truth he is trying to do what we all regularly do, find out what it's all  about, life I mean.  A superb novel.  Adios mis companeros!
B000025RAU|1.0|While most critics laud CHINATOWN as the best film in Polanski's career, I find it probably his worst.  Polanski once claimed that this film was inspired by Howard Hawks' 1945 classic, THE BIG SLEEP, but he obviously has made a serious mistake in his job of imitation.  In THE BIG SLEEP, the detective Humphrey Bogart is a friend of Lauren Bacall's father, and this is how he gets himself involved.  Bacall's father trusts Bogart!  But in CHINATOWN, Polanski seems to have completely forgotten the importance of such human relationship.  In the first place, the setting is all wrong.  Jack Nicholson is a nobody; Faye Dunaway is a woman with a very complicated background; John Huston is her monstrous father.  Such relationship makes Dunaway's approach to Nicholson totally unconvincing. ... Huston is a beast who has designed the most complicated and clever plot.  Witty it may seem, but is it really?  ....  The ending simply contradicts everything previously told in the film.  In other words, this film is a mistake from the beginning to the end, and to award this film an Oscar for the best screenplay was the greatest mistake on earth!  Was the Academy blind or something!
B00000JCOV|5.0|It combines low Pitched Guitars with 2 percusions. It is JustAMAZING. Slipknots singer just spazez out in surfacing so just get it.
0684801558|2.0|As a fan of Fitzgerald's writing, I was truly disappointed bythis book.  Verbose and somewhat boring early on in the text, the bookhas none of the best qualities of his better works.  His tendency to write the elegant sentence is taken too far too often in this text, having the effect of a continual stream of unnecessary adjectives normally associated with writers below his caliber.  The work also seems thrown together, with pieces of stage script and overly-sentimental poetry splashed among the pages.  I can't help but think, with respect to how unpolished the product was, that he had an idea and a deadline and the deadline won.  Better books to read by Fitzgerald are The Great Gatsby, Tender is the Night, and even the unfinished The Love of the Last Tycoon.  His collected short stories also offer enjoyable reading.  I realize I am at odds here, but I cannot recommend this book.
B00000JMQD|4.0|I first saw this film when I was 7 or 8 years old. Before I even knew about the Oz books. The scary scenes didn't necceserily give me nightmares. But I am glad that I didn't see it when I was younger. I really don't think  that this is a sequal to the MGM movie. This film was founded on Walt  Disney's original plan to make a musical film about Oz using the  Mouseketeers for the cast. But after three years (1958) the project was  dropped because of Disney's frustrations with the script and designs. Some  33 years later (1985) the project was reopened with an entirely different  plot and there aren't any songs in it at all not even a theme song. The  film was made in England and their is one rather important scene of about 4  minutes that was cut for the United States version in which the Scarecrow  decides at the coronation that he doesn't want to be King after all. I am  currently searching for a British version of the film so that I can see  that scene. At the coronation I noticed a lot of other Oz characters in the  background, including &quot;Froggie&quot;. But not &quot;Woggie&quot;,  sorry.
B00001U0GQ|4.0|This is a great movie but the DVD version is a severe disappointment. I am not so disappointed by the director's different artistic vision as I am by the poor quality of the DVD itself. If you liked the original version you  probably won't like this. <br />I suggest putting the original version on the  opposite side then the movie should be recut again to produce a technically  superior version that reflects the director's vision. And this time put in  the scene that explains where on earth they got the canoes they took to the  fort.
1570427496|1.0|The lack of substance in this book negated all &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; feelings so typical of the author's other works.  The characters were never developed enough to allow them to be believable.  I generally find that  authors make the best readers for audio books.  Unfortunately, that was not  the case with this one.  If I weren't stuck with it, I would have returned  this one after the first 10 minutes.

B00003CWPR|5.0|I am from Germany that's why I only know the unedited version of Kubrick's masterpiece, but I don't think that the American version is very different. This is Kubrick's best movie. Eyes Wide Shut is one of the most exciting  and fascinating movies I've ever seen. The visualisation is fantastic, very  stylish and cool. The performances of the actors are great, especially  Kidman's, who deserves an Oscar. It's a shame that this movie wasn't a  nominee at this years Academy Award show. The Soundtrack is wonderful and  sometimes very creepy. The movie itself is sometimes very creepy for  example the Masked Ball. This film isn't for people who don't want to think  while watching a movie, this movie is an intellectual movie. Kubrick Rules!
0780628551|3.0|Take &quot;The Devil's Advocate&quot;, turn Satan into an Alien, make it a little more boring and you have &quot;the Astronaut's wife&quot;. The film is great to look at, the cast are all great actors (though they don't all  prove it here. You get the feeling that Johnny was saving his real skills  for Sleepy Hollow). The Director proves he is Competant, the only let-down  is the Screenplay. It takes far too long to get where it's going and when  it finally makes it to the climax, it's over with in just over a minute.  Other than that it is enjoyable enough and ... Charlize Theron looks  stunning!
0486268659|5.0|Having seen the various movie versions over the years, I was pleasantly surprised at how enchanting, haunting and moving this story is. So much more exists in the story than is ever included in a film, that one finds it  that much more entertaining although the story is so well known. Easily  readable, but then that was Charles Dickens' style, I ploughed through it  in an afternoon and reached the end before I truly expected to...
0440217563|3.0|Voyager, the third book in the New World Series (or Outlander series, depending on what your preference is) is pretty enjoyable.  The first 300 pages are, in particular, quite enjoyable....I couldn't put it down.  After  that, however, it slows down, and becomes somewhat dull.  Regardless, I'm  looking forward to book number four, but didn't enjoy this one as much as  books one and two.  Still worth a read, and still more enjoyable than most  historical romance-type books.
0312932081|5.0|This book is excellent! I couldn't put it down after my sis gave it to me to read. Her 10th grade teacher gave it to the class to read, my sis read and liked so thats kind of the reason I ended up with it. When you read the  book you almost become him. You feel strong almost as if you could conquer  the world from hearing the way he thinks, works, feels and reacts to  loosing his family. Orson draws you deep into the depths of space when you  travel at light speed to hidden planets or space stations and always with a  happening along the way. I highly sudgest you read this book along with  Ender's Shadow(paralell to Ender's Game), Speaker for the Dead, and  Xenocide. I myself haven't yet read any of his books besides  these.<br />-*Jades_14*-
006017322X|4.0|I first got this book for my Literature and i got feedback from my Aunts and my mum. And they all said stuff like it was a really boring book. So i read it for myself and guess what! I actually found it GREAT! I recommend  this book for all those who love Literature and reading. It contains good  Vocabulary and this would be a great help to those who lack it. Being told  from the child's point of view, it was exciting and of course, humourous!  Read it! it's the perfect read!

B000000OYN|5.0|This was the very first Whitesnake album I ever heard.  I was stationed in Germany at the time, and Whitesnake was huge there, way before Slide It In, which many people still think was the first Whitesnake album.  The original  versions of &quot;Crying In the Rain&quot; and &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;  are great - and one of them even has a change in lyrics (I don't want to  give it away - listen for yourself).  I will never forget seeing these guys  in Nuremberg in 1984.  Great show, and this is a great album.  If you've  ever been a fan of Whitesnake, this is a must!
630575067X|4.0|All the negative reviewers need to pipe down.  After a 14 year drought, this Star Wars was just as good as the first three.  True, the actors were probably left to direct themselves, but the creatures and the special  effects were great.  We got to see the future connection between Palpatine  and young Skywalker.  Did anyone catch the fact the Skywalker was caring  and kind as a child?  We all know what he becomes later on.  This alone  will make me anticipate the next two movies to see how he becomes so  &quot;twisted and evil&quot;.  And, at the end of the movie, we got to see  young Obi-wan sporting the brown robe with the hood.   Natalie Portman was  elequent in her role as the queen.  This is an instant classic!  Buy it!
6303332609|5.0|This movie is great I first saw this movie when I was 14,when this movie first came and at first I thought this was going to be a dumb movie and when it finished I was pleased with the F/X and I thought this is one of  the real sci-fi classics and I hope that this movie will come out on DVD.
B000005JAB|5.0|Paris 1919 is an exceptional album. John Cale is an incredible song writer. The lyrics on this album are true poetry. Every song is great. The standout songs are Child's Christmas In Wales, Paris 1919 and Half Past  France. All the others are equally great.<br />Paris 1919 is one of Cale's  softest, most accesible album. It is also one of his best, possibly the  best. Fear is another great Cale album that is hard to beat, but this album  comes pretty close. I highly reccomend this album.
B000002WPI|5.0|Yeah, if your going to buy a CD in the near future, buy &quot;36 Chambers&quot; by Wu Tang. This is the greatest hip-hop album you'll ever hear.  With the tightest flows, this album is the best.  Without it, you'll  never hear how great hip-hop really is.  This is a necessity.
B00000HZTB|5.0|Lou Reed has so many incredible albums. This is one of the best. The Blue Mask has the best of both sides of Reed. His softer side is beautifully expressed by the Heroine and The Day John Kennedy Died. His harsh side rips  right through with songs like Waves of Fear and The Blue Mask. Easily one  of Reed's Best. Buy it.
B000000OF6|5.0|This album is my favourite album because in thisw album there are the most beautiful songs.Like bicycle race,killer queen,the show must go on,who wants to live forever,radio ga ga...They are really beutiful songs.I have  listened queen since  was 4.I love their songs.I think when you listen  this album you think that the songs lyrick's are splendid.You know that  killer queen has a price from it's lyrick.Another lyrick or another song  will write like killer queen,the show must go on,radio ga ga,who wants to  live forever.And  can't forget bohemian rhapsody.t is the best millenium  song.Bohemian rhapsody Freddie's another inaccessble song.You will find  your best song which you have wished from fars in radio ga ga.It's a very  beautiful song from Roger.I think it's your manner.I think when you buy  this album you will be very happy cause of this lordly songs.Think of that  when you have this cassette you will have the best millenim song and the  other beautiful songs which have got prizes.So buy this album.
051788710X|5.0|A few years ago, during a difficult phase of my life, I dreamed some BIG dreams.  Wanting some assistance with interpreting them and trying to avoid the usual dry, inaccurate and impersonal dream encyclopedias, I was drawn  to the title of this book.  I was not disappointed.  It launched me on a  profound journey that continues to unfold today.  It offers explanations  and guidance, while leaving an appreciation of the mysteries inherit in  dreaming intact.<br />Clearly and comprehensively written, useful for both the  novice and experienced dreamer, it offers a wealth of information on  various types of dreams (dreams of healing, dreams of the departed, dreams  of the future, etc.) and ways to access their meanings.  One of the most  helpful aspects of it, for me, was the ample number of dream stories from  the author's experiences and those of other people, which illuminate each  chapter.  He gives some excellent strategies, not only for interpretation  of dreams, but for how to dream more consciously and find the answers you  need.  I was so impressed with the book, I wrote to the author, and he  generously responded.  I even signed up for one of his workshops (which was  great, by the way).  Robert Moss is an accomplished storyteller, historian  and educator.   If you are a dream seeker, you will find gold here.
079074841X|5.0|I personally felt that Stanley Kubrick's vision in his concluding film was ingenius.  The manner in which he captured the jealousy and betrayal of modern society's relationships was extraordinary.  From the eerie orgy  sequence to the hilarious closing line by Nicole Kidman, this movie was  truly an epic.  But, what really made this movie so fantastic was the  question, Does true love exist, or is it merely an illustration from a  dream?
0440219078|5.0|I generally do not read entire books in one sitting. I could not put this one down. Each chapter left me wanting more. The maturing of Jonus in his understanding of his society is rivetting. I felt his sorrow as his  understanding grew that he could not return to the perfect society he once  knew. A gem of a book and a strong recommondation.
B000002UD0|5.0|Walls and Bridges is a great album. I would actually give it 4 and one half stars. It doesn't quite equal Imagine and it isn't close to Plastic Ono Band. I would still reccomend, though. The highlights of the album are  Whatever Gets You Thru The Night, What You Got, #9 Dream, Steel and Glass  and Nobody Loves You. All the other songs are slightly weak, but still  good. This is a great album. Buy It.
B000002UA0|5.0|Throw away &quot;dark side,&quot; &quot;the wall{the bore},&quot; and the other pop-elevator gibberish. Listen to PINK FLOYD for a change!  Boy did this band go downhill when Barret left. From a truly great band to a  Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, ho-hum, bunch of bores!
B000002LGA|5.0|New York is everything a Lou Reed album should be and more. Every song is great. Never before have such ugly stories put to such beautiful music. If it has been done before, it was either done by Reed or John Cale. New York  is an essential Lou Reed album. Buy It.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|I don't have much to say, The Evil Dead was the first horror movie I saw: I loved it; it scared me.  This special DVD edition is Godly.  The picture is so sharp that it is like watching a different film.  In addition to this  fact improving both the spooky reality of picture and the gore effects, if  you are a Great British viewer (or possibly from another country which  recieved the same cut of the film as us) then you will be surprised,  repulsed and probably excited to find out that there is more violence and  gore in this edition.<br />If you're a fan, you NEED this edition, though its  bonus materials are one-see features, and if you've never checked out The  Evil Dead realise you are deprived and either take the chance on this baby  or view it courtesy of someone who knows what great gore horror is  about.<br />In any case, this is a must-see for the picture sharpness alone.
B000002MUN|5.0|Wildflowers is a great album. Tom Petty is often overlooked as a great songwriter. I know his stuff is simple and easy, but it's great. Petty is a true rocker. <br />Wildflowers is an album that proves all of this. You Don't  Know How It Feels is one of my favorite songs by Petty. You Wreck Me, It's  Good To Be King, Honey Bee, Cabin Down Below, and A Higher Place are all  incredible also. Every song is great. This album is truly essential to any  fan of Tom Petty.
6304432461|3.0|die hard is an average film,it's a high explosive action movie starring bruce willis in his best performance,its about a building under hostage with german terriostes but john mclahn becomes the hero and saves the  day.the first 20 min of the movie is bloody boreing
B000002G87|5.0|Layla is an incredible album. It was one of Clapton's first album of his best decade as a solo artist; the 70s. Layla, Bell Bottom Blues, and all the others are incredible songs. Listen to this album!
6304432461|3.0|die hard is an average film,it's a high explosive action movie starring bruce willis in his best performance,its about a building under hostage with german terriostes but john mclahn becomes the hero and saves the  day.the first 20 min of the movie is bloody boreing
B000003TBP|5.0|Odelay is Beck's best album. It is also one of the best albums of the 90s. This music will appeal to anyone. That is very unique in an album. Buy it.
630575067X|4.0|I honestly don't see why everyone complains about Episode 1 so much. When it comes down to it, this is one of the finest Sci-Fi films to be released in years. The problem is that everyone wants to stand TPM next to it's big brothers, which it simply can't compete with.<br />Complaints? Sure, I've  got'em. Even with their age-old special effects, the original trio of SW  films were written and executed with pure plot in mind. Lucas himself said  that TPM was written for children, hence the relative simplicity in story  and the lack of any profanity or &quot;adult themes.&quot; I still don't  understand how it didn't earn a 'G' rating. The events revolving around Pod  Racing (which make up half the movie) and the Power Ranger-like Jedi/Sith  fight scenes are all designed to make the kiddies say &quot;Whoa  cool!&quot; Did it bother anyone else that Jar Jar recieved more character  development than Darth Maul? And was I the only person who heard the name  &quot;Senator Palpatine&quot; and said &quot;Oh gee, I wonder what part  HE'S going to play here? &quot;<br />But all things considered, when you stop  saying &quot;Hey, where's the swanky Han Solo character, and why isn't the  Sith guy breathing really deeply?&quot; and stand Episode 1 next to the  piles of Sci-Fi garbage that make it to theaters every year, things don't  look so bad. TPM towers in many ways over the last few Star Trek films and  blows away such trash as &quot;Supernova&quot;, the Alien clone,  &quot;Pitch Black,&quot; as well as other child-oriented sci-fi/fantacy  films such as Pokemon. This is all, of course, my opinion. I could be  wrong.<br />PS: Leonardo is NOT staring in Episode II. That rumor was out the  door months ago. Lucas prefers casting no-name talents over big stars in  the first place, and I don't think he wants a flood of horny teenage girls  that have never even heard the Skywalker name crowding the theaters full of  true SW fans. Comments?
B000002552|5.0|The Basement Tapes has some of the best recordings by both the Band and Bob Dylan. Every Song is incredible. The highlights of the album are Odds and Ends, Yazoo Street Scandal, Clothes Line Saga, Tears of Rage, Please,  Mrs. Henry, Ruben Remus, and This Wheel's On Fire. But it. It is essential  for fans of both The Band and Dylan.
0679746048|5.0|The sixties was a confusing enough time for anyone, but throw in the turmoils of being a young woman and you have what psychology of the times called borderline personality. Susanna Kaysen was diagnosed with this  disorder, one which doctors slapped on anyone they didn't have a category  for, and she was sent to live in a mental institution for two years. She  wasn't really crazy at all, and that's the irony of this true story: that  if you are labelled as troubled, or insane, or whatever, people will look  at you that way, especially if you are in the right environment for that  kind of behavior, even if you are perfectly normal. It's enough to make a  sane person go nuts. This book amazed me, brought me to tears, made me  laugh, made me want to punch through a wall. Since the people described by  Kaysen are all real, there is a kind of awe you feel at knowing what they  went through, and you feel as if you know them. This book is easy reading  and I would recommend it to anyone, especially someone who feels like they  sometimes live on the fringe of reality. Because we all are, at least some  of the time.
B00000253N|5.0|Blood On The Tracks is incredible. It is one Of Dylan's best albums, possibly his second or third best. It is just outstanding. Tangled Up In Blue is one of my all time favorite Dylan songs. Simple Twist Of Fate,  Idiot Wind, and Shelter From The Storm also stand out. Every song, however,  is incredible. Buy this album immediately.
057120211X|3.0|Although film scripts are always fun to read and compare to what actually got into the movie, please take this adaptation of the masterpiece Girl, Interrupted at face value (or less). The book far surpasses the movie...  you lose so many scenes that bring out the true essence of each person, who  are not &quot;characters,&quot; but real people! In the film, they are  reduced to characters. By the way, the ending in the film (Angelina backing  Winona up with a knife in the basement) is completely false and the book  ending is much better. True, the movie has its priceless moments -- my  favorite scene is in the ice cream parlor -- but please just read the book.  It is divided up into sections, some that are just 2 or 3 pages long, and  it's such easy reading.
B000002G7G|5.0|The Velvet Underground's third album is their softest album to be released. It is also one of their best. Although John Cale is a musical genius, Reed is also. This album shows that they could be incredible and  influential without Cale. This album doesn't have quite the mainstream  sound as Loaded, but it is close. Besides The Murder Mystery, all the songs  are commercially accesible. I'm not saying that is good or bad. It is just  a fact. The Murder Mystery is still a great song. Pale Blue Eyes is one of  their best ballads. Songs like What Goes On and Beginning to See The Light  show that they can really rock. And Some Kinda Love has those kinky lyrics  that are like Sister Ray and Femme Fatale. Every Song Is Incredible. VU  didn't release a bad song. Buy This album.
B0000029GA|5.0|IF YOU'RE A HIP HOP FAN, THEN YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S UP WITH THIS ALBUM.  AND IN ALL HONESTY NAS DEFINETLY FELL OFF.  IT SEEMS LIKE WHEN RAPPERS FINALY MAKE IT, THEY SELL OUT JUST TO STAY RICH.  BUT ENOUGH PROPS GOES OUT  TO THE NAS OF 94' AND EVERYONE WHO TOOK PART ON MAKING THIS ALBUM A  CLASSIC.   ONE
B000002C1X|5.0|The Wall is my favorite album by Pink Floyd. It is one of the longest, largest musical experiences I have ever had. And I've listened to it at least ten times all the way through and will more. No other band sounded  like Pink Floyd and none ever will. <br />Every song on the Wall is  incredible. I won't mention any because it would take too long. This album  is possibly one of my five favorite albums of alll time. It is truly  impressive. This type of music isn't for everyone, but it is worth trying.  Buy it.
B00001QGPS|4.0|Method Man &amp; Redman got skills.  I like most of the songs on Blackout!, but the beats on some of The songs sound similar to the other songs.  &quot;A Special Joint (Intro)&quot; talks about getting  &quot;high&quot;.  &quot;Blackout&quot; has a tight beat.  It sound like a  song that should be played in a stadium.  No, &quot;Mi Casa&quot; is not a  Spanish song.  the beat sounds similar to the next song; &quot;Y.O.U.&quot;   After the funny skit on &quot;Y.O.U.&quot; is &quot;4 Seasons&quot;.   &quot;4 Seasons&quot; features Ja Rule &amp; LL Cool J.  Certain rappers  always feel like they gotta talk about killing people, such as track 6  &quot;Cereal Killer&quot;.  &quot;Da Rockwilder&quot; is short but tight.   &quot;Tear It Off&quot; is another song on the album with a tight beat.   <br />The &quot;Where We At&quot; skit is slow but funny.  &quot;1, 2, 1,  2&quot; is alright.  I'm not feeling this one.  &quot;Maaad Crew&quot; is  kinda slow but not weak.  I think &quot;Run 4 Cover&quot; has the tightest  beat on the album.  It features Ghostface &amp; Street.  The hook on  &quot;The ?&quot; has a lil' sample from &quot;Can I Get a...&quot;.   &quot;Dat's Dat S**t&quot; is CRAZY!  &quot;Cheka&quot; is alright.  The  album has 3 extra tracks: &quot;Well All Rite Cha&quot;, &quot;Big  Dogs&quot; &amp; How High (Remix).  The &quot;How High (Remix)&quot; is  better than the original version.  This album has catchy hooks.  I would  recommend the Edited Version if you don't like listening to a lot of  cussing.  This CD is crazy!
B000001F3C|5.0|All of U2's albums are good. Their three best are, respectively, Achtung Baby, The Joshua Tree and War. War falls sort of the other two, but it is still great. Sunday Bloody Sunday, New Year's Day, and Two Hearts Beat as  One are the highlights of the album. This album is essential to fans of U2.
B00000JBCP|5.0|I stumbled across Mana for the first time a few years ago on one of those music award shows on Univision. This is the 2nd CD of theirs that I bought, and it has become my favourite. The songs are arranged well and the order  flows very smoothly. The tracks that tend to stay with me are &quot;No ha  parado de llover&quot;, &quot;Rayando el sol&quot; &amp; &quot;Oye mi  amor&quot;. I can almost see the expressions on Fher's face as he's singing  these songs - that's how expressive his voice and their music is.  Other  folks I've shared this CD with all loved it, even those who are new to Rock  en Espanol. Its a good CD to listen to when you're hanging out or when you  want to have something lively playing. I highly recommend adding it to your  collection.
B000002C1V|4.0|The Final Cut isn't Floyd's best album, but it is great. All the songs are really good, they just don't collectively equal albums like DSOTM, The Wall, and Wish You Were Here. I would still say that this album is  essential to any Pink Floyd Fan.
0679746048|5.0|I just got done reading Girl, Interupted. I loved it. Susanna is open and honest in this book, holding nothing back. I was hospitalized years ago myself, and can remember the same thoughts, feelings and going-ons. I  admire Susanna for her strenght and courage. Read it.
B000002KNU|5.0|The Talking Heads debut album is one of their best. Probably second after More Songs. Psycho Killer, New Feeling, and Pulled Up are the best songs on the album, but they are all incredible. This is an album that everyone  should own.
6305609721|3.0|Star Trek IV is my least-favorite of all the films. (OH MY GOD! Is this guy crazy? )<br />I know, I know! It was fun and original and blah, blah, blah.  Im not saying I hated it, but I just don't enjoy this type of Star  Trek story.  I think the film is very funny, light, and entertaining.  I  thoroughly enjoyed it when I first saw it.  Unfortunately, the comedy  aspects wear off in repeat viewings and you're left with a mediocre story  with no real suspense or drama. <br />There are some priceless scenes, but  many other parts of it are dull and slightly corny.  The &quot;science  fiction&quot; aspect of the previous movies has become more like  &quot;science fantasy&quot; in &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;.  <br />William  Shatner and Leonard Nimoy are fun to watch together, and the best parts of  the movie are the 15 to 20 minutes where the crew splits up into groups to  solve different problems.  It's interesting to see the co-stars off on  their own interacting without Captain Kirk leading the way.<br />Other than  those high-points, this is pretty average.  The DVD is weak as far as  extras go, which I think is the main reason for buying them.  The  behind-the-scenes featurette is off the Director's Series VHS tape (which I  own), so don't give Paramount too much credit!<br />Those demanding extras on  Star Trek DVD's can e mail them by going to:<br />homevideo@pde.paramount.com
B000002KDI|5.0|Live Rust is incredible. Neil Young is one of my all time favorite rock artists. Rust Never Sleeps is my favorite Neil Young album. This one goes hand and hand with it. It has four songs from that album and some of the  best from his othe albums to that date. Buy it and buy Rust Never Sleeps.
B00000IPAX|3.0|I was really looking forward to this CD, seeing how much I loved every song on Dude Ranch. There's just no songs that really jump out at me as really good except &quot;Adams Song&quot; and &quot;WMAA&quot;, whereas  Dude had so many classics. I hope the next CD turns back into Dude form.
B000002KBD|5.0|Street Choir is one of Van's best. Probably his second or third best. It doesn't equal Moondance, but it comes close. All the songs are great. Especially Domino, I've Been Working, Blue Money, Crazy Face and Gypsy  Queen. I would reccomend this album to any fan of music.
076783819X|5.0|This Film is absoloutly mind blowing, no pun intended. Stop reading all these reviews, you are wasting your time, time that could be spent watching one of the best made films ever, that is action filled and will leave you  on the edge of your seat right till the end, the movie?Arlington  Road.My  advice? Dont rent it,Buy It!
B000005IU1|5.0|The Stooges debut album is incredible. It is a sign of great things to come. It doesn't equal Raw Power or their best album, Fun House, but it is still incredible. 1969, I Wanna Be Your Dog and No Fun are the best songs  on the album. Also, John Cale produced the album, which is pretty cool. The  Stooges were the loudest, harshest band of their time. This album begins to  show that. Buy it.
B00002DEQQ|5.0|The Voice just completely rocks on this album, and almost all of the songs are gems -- especially the cover of the old Three Dog Night classic &quot;Mama Told Me Not to Come&quot; with the Stereophonics, &quot;You Need  Love Like I Do&quot; with Heather Small, the gorgeous &quot;Sometimes We  Cry&quot; with Van Morrison, and &quot;Lust for Life&quot; with the  Pretenders, never sounding better.  Even if this one takes a while to be  released in the United States, pick up the import.  I live in Latvia where  this CD has been sold out solid for weeks, and that ain't no surprise!
B0000025KI|5.0|The River is another of Springsteen's great albums. He is one of the greatest song writers of all time, and this album has Twenty of his great songs. This album is a Must Have for any Springsteen fan.
B00004SVIK|5.0|brilliance, ive been waiting for this for years..... it is pink floyd at their finest i bought 2 ltd editions 1 to play the hell out of and the other to appreciate in value, if you are a floyd fanatic or just  occasionaly listen to them...buy this record, even if you dont get the  limited edition, you will enjoy this albulm over and over again, ive had it  a day and alredy listened to it 5 times, roger waters, david gilmour, nick  mason and richard wright at their absolute finest hour, the guitar solos on  mother, and comfortably numb will send shivers up your spine. dont think  twice buy this albulm and buy it today
B000002J1U|5.0|Every single Zeppelin album is incredible. This one is often overlooked, and for a good reason. It is incredible, but it can't compete withe II, IV, or Houses of the Holy. It is still essential. Buy it.
0783225881|1.0|What a bunch of new age tripe.  The most superficial, &quot;feel-good&quot; nonsense I've seen since - well, I can't remember.  Added to a terrible script and across the board overacting is one of the worst cinematic depictions of baseball.  If Ray Liotta ever played a game  of ball in his life, it doesn't show.  He couldn't play tee-ball.  The rest  of the &quot;players&quot; were equally bad.  In addition to actors who  couldn't make a bad rec softball team, the attention to detail was  horrible. Ray Liotta's Joe Jackson &quot;hits&quot; righthanded, while the  real Joe hit lefthanded.  They mispronounce Eddie Cicotte's name.  I could  go on, but won't.  Simply horrible.  You want a great baseball movie, get  Bull Durham, The Natural or Eight Men Out.  You want a Lifetime TV movie,  get this.
B00000K3G8|5.0|Stop Making Sense is one of the greatest live albums of all time. The live versions of the songs are as good as the album versions, if not better. Psycho Killer, Thank You For Sending Me An Angel, Burning Down The House,  and Life During Wartime really stand out. There isn't, however, a bad song  on the entire album. Buy it.
0684843749|5.0|I came across this book when I was 14.  At that time I started bodybuilding to strengthen my back which was effective.  Some exercises do not require the aid of weights but just using my body weight was sufficient  to progressively build and consolidate muscle groups.  No matter if I  workout at the gym, at home, holiday, or on business trip the exercises are  effective.  This is definitely a book to own and take action no matter if a  beginner or have been working out for years.
B000002MFN|5.0|This is one of Madonna's greatests cd's.  One the first Madonna albumsI bought : absolutely no regrets at all !  It appeared together withthe &quot;Sex&quot;-book and &quot;Body Of Evidence&quot;. . . On this one, Madonna leaves her mind and soul open, and starts to experiment. There is a surprising collaboration &quot;Did You Do It ?&quot;. &quot;Erotica&quot; is a fantastic follow-up to the majestic &quot;Justify My Love&quot;.  If you like this track, then you should check out the remix by William Orbit.  Fantastic !  And there are the little house-pop tunes like &quot;Fever&quot; and &quot;Deeper And Deeper&quot;, and beautiful ballads like &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Bad Girl&quot; and &quot;Secret Garden&quot;.  &quot;Thief Of Hearts&quot; is also great.
0800128052|5.0|I can't remember how many times i've seen this movies... possibly over 20 times... and every time I watch it, i've cried and i've cheered.  I must say that this movies has inspired me like no other movies has.  It's an incredible feeling that I cannot explain in a few sentences.  Rudy has  touched so many people and i feel compelled to say that yes, everyone  should watch this movies because it is a movies that will last in your  memories forever.  <br />Rudy is a gift that I can only hope that everyone  will have and cherish.  It is a gift that will forever take a part of my  life and I hope yours too.  <br />Thank you Rudy for the great memories.
0783232039|5.0|Bride Of Chucky is a must see film and definatley the best in the series so far. The film is much more centred around chucky than the previous ones. Even if you dont like horror movies you should see this movie. Role on the  sequel.
6305127638|4.0|When the Enterprise went behind the Borgship they opened the door to the past and they weren't destroyed because they were sheltered on the time door so that mistake that you are pointing out is not a mistake watch the  movie again and you will see that they explain that.
0517122707|5.0|This is an excelent piece of liturature.  Ignatius' language and story line are incredible.  Ignatius is funny and keeps you wanting to read more.  I recomend this book with no reserve.
0446607274|5.0|Connelly is an excellent genre writer, and Angels Flight is among the best of the mystery genre (let alone the thrilling Harry Bosch series).  The author captures modern Los Angeles in a way I can only imagine it to be, as  vividly and with as much elan as Chandler.  He's a master of modern LA  suspense.
B00001ODHL|5.0|An AWSOME movie.  A MUST see.  Greatly done, well acted.  funny and scary.  I've seen it 5 times and I still love it!
B00003CWRX|5.0|Words cannot describe the artwork and character depth displayed in this film. This is a masterpiece of filmmaking. A lot of times you can tell a great film when it does poorly at the box office but well in the eyes of  critics. This is one of those cases. For all those folks who don't go watch  a movie at the theater to wait for video because they aren't sure that they  will like it-my advice is get it, watch it, and then think of the powerful  lessons it teaches about many facets of your own life while it is still  fresh on your mind. Yes it is still a hollywood movie and therefore candy  coated but it comes as close to the truth as any film ever dares to try.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|This movie is more creative than most movies out there.  The story is exciting and the characters are a delightful combination.  With wit, charm, and a load of laughs Ghostbusters is one of my favorites.
B000002UAU|5.0|After reading a few of the reviews of this, and other Beatle albums, it struck me how strongly people feel about their music. Everyone seems to  compare their favorite bands or albums to the Beatles, or one of their  records. The album that draws the most comparison is this one. Yes, its  that good. Not the Beatles best work, but certainly their most influencial.  All popular music after that time in some way changed or took on different  incarnations(for better and worse). &quot;Exile on Main St&quot; is  probably a very good album, but it is no way comparable to  &quot;Peppers&quot;. Indeed, the Stones, or the Beach Boys, (and Ill  include the Rasberries for &quot;LH&quot; since he seems to be the only one  who &quot;appreciates&quot; their genius. Ill bet you spend alot of time  &quot;All by Yourself&quot;)or any other groups/artist fans need be so  malicious with your reviews, if you dislike the Beatles, why do you review  aaallllll of their albums. Its old and it sounds envious. Ill agree with  those who say that &quot;Pepper&quot; doesnt have the same bite as it did  when it was originally released, but the point is, this record added a lot  of bite to pop music, and expanded the possibilites of what Rock/Pop music  could be. As for the reviewer that holds the Beatles, and in particular,  &quot;Pepper&quot;, responsible  for the Backstreet/N Sync craze, all I  have to say to that is that is really reaching. As far as packaged  material, and productions, look no further than your precious Stones last  few albums and tours. As to the music, any album with &quot;A Day in the  Life&quot; and &quot;Sgt Peppers&quot; &quot;LSD&quot; &quot;Getting  Better&quot; &quot;Shes Leaving Home&quot; is worth at least a listen, even  for the biggest Stone/B-Boys fans.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Like James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, Barry White? I'm nearly 50 and this is one of the best CD's I've heard in a long time. Wonderful driving music, ethereal melodies, sexy beat--The Sky is Broken is tops. The CD photos of  Moby mask the real gifts in this album. I think it will be timeless.
B000002LFZ|5.0|This is one of the best albums I ever heard! Stevie Nicks is one great singer, and &quot;Dreams&quot; has worked its way up to one of my favorite songs ever.
0767819594|5.0|Cruel Intentions is one of the hottest movies ever made.  Every scene is at least tangentially related to sex.  A real eye opener, there are scenes of lesbianism, homosexuality, incest (or at least between step-siblings),  inter-racial sex, and cyber-porn.  At times a descent into rather base  fantasies of revenge and seduction, it is redeemed by the fact that most of  its characters at least look their age.  Nothing is worse than a  30-year-old having to play an 18-year-old...vice versa would also be bad!
B000002LEE|5.0|Nothing's Shocking is one of the most amazing displays of musical force there is. The primal, screaming energy contained within is a revelation in the purest sense. Although it's not nearly as raging today as it was when  it was released, it still contains enough power to impress anyone.<br />The  music is incredible. Perry Farrell's manic howls provide some of the best  lyrics that can be found in alternative rock. Dave Navarro plays guitar  like a maniac, and Eric Avery's bass is what truly helps drive the band,  simple yet utterly brilliant. Stephen Perkin's drumming is incredible.  Every song on this album is good.<br />The opener, &quot;Up The Beach&quot; is  a sort of swaying, gentle track that provides a perfect introduction.  &quot;Ocean Size&quot; hits with the force of a tidal wave - play the song  LOUD. &quot;Had a Dad&quot; is melodic and groovy, and truly excellent.  &quot;Ted, Just Admit It&quot; is an epic, funky song. &quot;Standing in  the Shower . . . Thinking&quot; is a quick, hard blast of funk.  &quot;Summertime Rolls&quot; is a great song with a sort of dream-like  quality.<br />&quot;Mountain Song&quot; is simply one of the greatest things  ever recorded. The bassline is one of the best ever, and the song explodes  with a force that dwarfs most others. Perry howling &quot;coming down the  mountain . . .&quot; and &quot;cash in now, honey&quot; will send chills  down your spine. &quot;Idiots Rule&quot; rocks. &quot;Jane Says&quot; is a  classic, one of the all-time great songs. &quot;Pigs in Zen&quot; is a  brilliant, clever, insightful song, listen closely.<br />Nothing's Shocking is  simply an album you have to own.
B0000214F1|2.0|I have not yet seen the unedited version of this film but I made the mistake of renting the edited version a few years ago.  Don't do it, people!  They must have had to cut out so much footage, the plot is  completely hard to understand and all of a sudden it's all over.  However,  it was almost worth it to see Bob Guccione at the end come on screen and  say, &quot;Hello, I'm Bob Guccione.  What you have just seen is a  drastically edited version of my movie Caligula.  I do not approve of  censorship.  If you would like to order the unedited version through the US  mail, where FEDERAL laws, not LOCAL laws apply, please call...&quot;   Believe it or not this short little spiel actually inspired a lengthy  intelligent discussion amongst me and my family concerning censorship, etc.   But otherwise, stay away!
B00000IPAX|4.0|This is a good record. For one thing I catch myself staring at the cover art. I bought this CD for &quot;All the Small Things&quot;, but I found some other good songs. For one, &quot;What's My Age Again&quot; is a good  song that made me laugh. &quot;Adam's Song&quot; is another good one, but  unlike the other ones this song made me think about life after school. Just  the other night I heard &quot;Dysentary Gary&quot;, or whatever the hell it  is. So why didn't I give it 5 stars? The songs are to damn short.
6305627347|3.0|The tv show has me in stitches, but this movie absolutely repulses me. The language just isn't as funny when its allowed to flow freely, and the creative obscenities aren't funny for very long. Still, Saddam Hussein is the most hilarious effect that you'll ever see, and most of the humor is  funny, but this just isn't as good as the show. Please God, let there be no  more South Park movies. The song, &quot;Blame Canada&quot; was nominated  for best song at the Academy Awards. You can watch this movie once, but  that's it.
0786880708|5.0|Absolutely! :)  I guess I would just like to echo the various voices already singing this book's praises.  Meditation IS possible in the world we live in today--and Jon Kabat-Zinn shows us how in a very beautiful,  easily readable, yet thought-provoking manner.  I had the pleasure of  meeting both the author and his wife at a recent seminar on mindful  parenting and sense that they truly LIVE these words, though each in their  own unique way. And perhaps that's the beauty of mindfulness  meditation--for ALL of us!<br />Destined to be a classic (if not already.)   Read it.  Learn it.  Live it.  You won't regret it.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Man this is a big change for metallica.  This cd really show metallica's wide range of talent.  The best songs on this album are of wolf and man, Fuel, No Leaf Clover, Nothing Else Matters, Until it Sleeps, For whom the  bells toll, and Minus Human.  But one song that I think really sounded  better with the ochestra was for whom the bells toll that song was  amazing!   Also I loved No leaf clover.  And one thing that makes me  sick is the people that say metallica sold out.  I mean personally I like  thier new stuff better than the old and they can't get by anymore with hard  rock.  E-mail me if you would like to chat about anything metallica related  thanks.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|It was so cool!  I'm so glad that I got this CD.  My favorite song on the CD is &quot;Crash and Burn&quot;.  Whenever I'm having a bad day, I listen to this CD and instantly feel better.  The second best song is &quot;Two  Beds And A Coffee Machine&quot;.  It's really sad, but it's a beautiful  song.  I love the background music to it.  You'll know what I mean if you  hear it.  The third best song is &quot;Hold Me&quot;.  And &quot;The Lover  After Me&quot; is also really cool.  It's about a person that still has  feelings for someone even though they've gone.  &quot;I Knew I Loved  You&quot; is a really cool slow song.  And &quot;You Can Still Be  Free&quot; is a great song is most inspirational song.  All of the songs  are great.  Some make you want to cry, and others make you happy.  All in  all, this is a great CD. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Backstreet  Boys, NSync, Hanson, Jewel, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore, Celine Dion, or  Richard Marx.  Thanks for reading this long review!

B000002546|5.0|Few people have used the guitar as voice so effectively as Jeff Beck.  And few recordings in any genre have so beautifully melded guitar with instrumentation.  Although Blow By Blow has weak and dated moments, its  standout tracks are so startling that I keep referring back to it as a kind  of touch-point...to my own past, to an eternal expectation of how really  transcendant great music can be.  Three tracks have not dated, will never  date: &quot;Because We've Ended as Lovers&quot;, &quot;Scatterbrain&quot;  and &quot;Diamond Dust&quot;.  Each has a distinctive, difficult,  complicated mood.  Lovers weeps.  Scatterbrain has a manic, brilliant  energy and wonderful interplay with a lush, erotic backing string  arrangement. But my favorite Jeff Beck song will always be Diamond Dust.   Its mood is brooding, edgy, and yet elegiac.  The opening bars introduce an  uneasy melody against a counterpoint of piano.  From there the melody  twists around, punctuated by electric piano and the faint, brilliantly  arranged strings.  It builds and fades, sometimes bright, sometimes aching,  and when it ends, you feel as if you need to think a while, maybe take a  walk.  It's one of the most complicated and beautiful songs in modern music  and it amazes and hurts me that some people will die never having heard  it.<br />Jeff Beck's fusion forays aren't for everyone.  But there is no  denying his musicianship, nor his intimate virtuosity with mood and subtle  coloring.  This recording has been on my shelves for twenty-five years and,  God willing, it will be there for another fifty.
B000001EIA|5.0|For any long time KISS fan or just a lover of music, this unplugged album is great from the first track to the last. Not only do they play there classics, but hearing it acoustically brings a new sound to the songs you  grew up listening to. Going deep into the KISS vaults they pull out some  songs you wouldn't ordinarily hear played live. My personal fav A World  Without Heroes sounded incredible. With Genes voice being backed by only  acoustic guitars, it's a rock ballad at it's best. Pauls vocals on I Still  Love You prove that he is one of the most powerful singers in music today.  <br /> Every song has it's high points, but the magic hits when Ace and Peter  come on stage and join in on some songs. You can tell that the chemistry is  still there after all these years.   It was a new beginning as well as an  ending for the band. With this performance the reunion of the original four  members began, but sadly this was also Bruce Kulick and Eric Singers last  show.<br /> The last two songs Nothin'to Lose and the anthem Rock and Roll All  Nite will get your heart pumping, the energy just flows right through you.  With all six members on the stage from past to present, they prove they  still got what it takes to rock.  You wanted the best. You got the best.  The hardest working band in the world, KISS!
B000002HMH|5.0|Anyone who says that Metallica Sold out on the this Cd is wrong. Metallica is getting older and with that so will there music. If someone stopped liking Metallica fo this Cd was never a true fan. So what if it wasn't as  heavy as the other Albums, you could still get the samething out of it. It  was very hard to make a fallow up album when the last they released sold  over 10 million copies(i am talking about Black) If you are just listening  to Metallica for heaviness in it you haven't appreacted their music fully.  &quot;Bleeding Me&quot; if you ever block out the instruments and just  listen to the lyrics you will see how powerful Metallica really are. Lets  face it Metallica is Still the Best Band around. You should give them more  credit then calling them &quot;Sell outs.&quot; So what if they cut their  hair, hair does not make the band the band makes the band. In other words  they can either make or break themselfs.
6305718903|2.0|I'm sorry but this movie was very disappointing!  First of all, I've read and heard a lot about how this is ripping off the exorcist. Well, I did see some elements of the exoricist present, but nothing major. The movie was  very boring though. I could see a pathetic attempt to be scary, but it just  didn't work. Now one element that was lacking was a good soundtrack. The  Omen worked partially because of a great soundtrack. This movie could not  keep my attention because it left me bored. The music did not build  anything. Secondly, the whole point of the movie was left unanswered. It  ended with that one special message, but why did the priest possess that  girl? What was his purpose? I wonder if the writers even know! From what I  saw, I think a bunch of people recognized that movies in this genre have  done well in the past and that they would try to score off it as well.  Sorry fellas, but you failed.
B000002HMH|4.0|Even though not all the songs on this albam are heavy the cd is still good. Unlike the earlier Cds like Ride The Lightning and Master Of Puppets when every song on the cd would be a hit. This cd has only a couple of not  great songs. Don't get me wrong most of the songs are good its only about 4  of them that aren't really what Metallica sounding like back when the  relased them Cd Black. Load is still a very good Cd. If you have the means  i highly reconmend buying it.
0451191153|5.0|The Fountainhead was not inteded to entertain people.  It was intended to educate us, to show us a new point of view, and it does. Some would say the book is simply Ayn Rand stuffing her objectivism down the reader's throat,  but she has every right to, as she wrote the book.  As an audience, we must  simply try our best to see things as the characters see them. Although the  characters do seem a bit unrealistic at times, it is all to show the reader  the goal that Rand is getting at. Perhaps objectivism, like so many other  philosophies, can never exist in the real world in its true form, but  perhaps just a touch of it could make our lives better. It seems, as this  book shows us, that if we were to all put a little Howard Roark in our  lives, maybe the world would be a better place.  Even if it didn't, Howard  Roark still proves to be one of the greatest unsung heroes in fiction.
B000044U4B|5.0|This is one of many great Cds by Metallica. Fade To Black is on of my favorite songs on this Cd. Anyone who likes the songs which start off slow and then build up into excellent guritar playing would like this song. With  all Metallica songs remember to turn the volume up to 100.
B000006OAM|5.0|The wings of birds is still not as free as this album is with lyrics composed of truth and reality. Natalie Merchant defiently from the sounds of this album immersed herself into the creative process and she has reaped  in the awards. The songs, Ophelia, Life is Sweet, Kind and Generous, My  Skin, Break your Heart, Thick as Thieves, and The Living twists the  listener's ear into sensing the whole story in front and behind them.  Complex lyrics to Thick as Thieves leaves the listener feeling complete,  but confused. A nice confusion that we do not mind, for it is sweet like  her voice. We know that we can understand and we hold no ignorance to these  words. Her haunting melodies complete these songs and I say, it's a victory  for Natalie Merchant's sophmore solo album.
B000021XS0|5.0|This is definitely the greatest Dream Theater album to date, and that is a bold statement considering the standard the band has created and sustained for over a decade. The musicianship is unparalleled, the lyrics are  thought-provoking and rival those of any other concept album, and the sound  is phenomenal. James LaBrie's vocals have never been better, John Petrucci  has surpassed the talent, creativity, and diversity of his influences,  Jordan Rudess is the best keyboardist to play with the band and is a  welcome addition, and Mike Portnoy continues to pour every ounce of his  creativity, imagination, and virtuosity into his drum kit. While John Myung  demonstrates some of the greatest bass playing ever recorded, he is still  frustratingly left in the background, which is unfortunate. As my review  title suggests, the sound samples available here do not begin to do the  album justice. This masterpiece is 70-something minutes long, with a  well-told story woven throughout the intricate arrangements, amazing tempo  changes, and brilliant melodies. I repeatedly find myself sitting in my  living room, listening to this CD from the tick-tock of the hypnotist's  clock to the, well, I can't give away the ending, but to the end of the CD,  following the story intently in the CD's liner notes as it unfolds.  While each piece is incredible alone, it is best when listened to, at least the  first few times, in its entirety. Which brings me to my next point. If, when listening to this wondrous composition, you doubt the virtuosity of  these musicians, that in this electronic age such incredible ability and  timekeeping is only possible through the guise of computers and sound  effects, let me shatter such doubt. I had tickets to see Dream Theater  perform in Washington DC. As I anxiously awaited this life-fulfilling  event, my brother and I contemplated the show's set list. I told him that  it is virtually impossible to select individual pieces from this album; one  must experience the entire composition. Sure enough, the band opened the  show by flawlessly playing the entire &#34;Scenes from a Memory&#34;  album front to back. I continue to be amazed by what DT gives its fans with  each album, but I never experienced such an incredible display of  musicianship as well as appreciation for its fans as I did that night.  Finally, even if you have never heard of Dream Theater or, God forbid,  didn't find the band's previous works appealing, give this one a try. I  have a friend whose biggest influences are the Stones, the Beatles, and  Pearl Jam, and while Images and Words didn't impress him (don't ask, I  don't know) he loved it! Buy Scenes from a Memory NOW!  You won't regret  it.
B00004RFDW|5.0|Al Pacino and Rusell Crowe gave the performances of their career in the highly captivating Insider by Micheal Mann. Definate Best picture material in my mind. Based on a ture story the Insider did not fail to keep me in my seat. The drama about a tobacco insider who knows the secret of nicotine  and how addictive it can be, who was released from the company but couldn't  tell his stroy due to a confidentiality agreement that he signed with the  company. One of the best movies of 1999. A Definate Must See! <br />**Bri's  Movie Reviews can be found for Most Hollywood New Releases***
6304609825|5.0|I rate this one a 5 because of Maleficent.  She has style &amp; is my favorite Disney villian.
630416923X|4.0|The Beatles: Anthology_ suffers from an at times unsatisfying duality.  At once anthology and documentary, there are moments when the producers' need to include obscure video footage of the Beatles performing slows the narrative considerably.<br />In particular, the producers' enthusiasm for  showing lengthy excerpts of a concert--just to get across the point that  the boys weren't playing well--is frustrating.  Also, there are times where  the narrative given by interviews is actually incredibly sparse to make  room for performances that really don't merit the time.  In short,  _Anthology_ is like the subject it takes on: brilliant but at times  unabashedly self-indulgent.   The result is a vision for the project  sufficiently vague to prevent the editor from making clearer  choices.<br />Still, the work is completely absorbing.  It's impossible to see  it playing in a room and not want to sit down and watch it.  The story the  interviewees weave leaves you energized and melancholy simultaneously.   It's thrilling to see how great they were together and yet you can see the  tensions emerge and ultimately consume them.   <br />It's like looking back on  your first love and thinking about all the possibilities that might have  been.
6304500831|5.0|By far, this is my favorite Disney &amp; what does it is the music.  Some Disney films may have characters I love more with the great music, but this one does it.  Well done by the Sherman Brothers.
B00000K19E|5.0|As you have probably guessed by the title of this review, I am not a 15 year old boy.  Although there are aspects of this movies that I can certainly grasp as being quite as appealing to a teenaged kid as to me, I  am an adult and to prove it, here is a fact: I watched  &quot;Bladerunner&quot; the FIRST time it came out. &quot;The Matrix&quot;  has the same kind of sensibility.  What I am trying to say is that in both  cases the viewer must accept a complete vision of a world that has been  captured extremely stylishly by the directors. This has been sucessfully  done in both cases, in my opinion, and if you are a sci fi freak, or even  just a regular movie lover, make room for this unusally smoothly directed  and acted video in your library.  If you are female, Keanu Reeves will get  you through the few slow parts(even when he has the really  short hair),  and if you are male, you'd have to be nuts not to find Carrie-Anne Moss  appealing in her vinyl full body suit.  As a team, they are great when they  set off to rescue Laurence Fishburne.  No holds barred, a terrific scene.  Great pacing, high level of excitement.<br />So buy it. It is really  awesomely COOL, dudes!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is the one that started it all &amp; it still stands up.  Excellant music &amp; characters you'll never forget.
0780620828|3.0|I could go and say that this movie lacks in plot, and has too many special effects and I wouldn't be lying, but I loved it! Especialy when I saw it in the theatre. It was what got me interested in Spawn to begin with. Its plot  is a little different from the comic and the animated series, but like  McFarlane says in his interview, its boring to tell the same story over and  over. I think it could have been a little less sappy and Spawn should have  worn his mask more. I loved the way the cape was portrayed, that really  must have been hard to show, but i think it should have been with him more.  Without it he looks more human and normal. I LOVED Martin Sheen's acting,  and the other actors did great in bringing this book to life. A lot of  action too.
6302787068|5.0|Excellant film, the music &amp; the Genie by Robin Williams did it for me.  A favorite!
6305627347|4.0|Not a lot needs to be said about this movie. If you like the show, you'll like the movie. If you don't like the show, you won't like the movie. Simple as that. Only exception would be if you really hated songs. This  movie has a lot of them, but i think they're all pretty clever so i got no  problem with the songs.
078881172X|4.0|I did love Tinkerbell, one of my all time favorite Disney characters &amp; the music was great.  A few things could have been changed, but not much.
6305718954|3.0|I was expecting a scary movie like The Exorcist, but i was wrong. Its just about a girl who gets some wounds like Jesus did with no real twists in the plot to keep it very interesting. It wasn't horrible, but predictable. I  still enjoyed it.
6300274268|4.0|This isn't the best Disney movie.  The music was great, not the best.  Some good characters, but, still, alot better than Hunchback turned out.
B000002LQR|4.0|This is a truly one-of-a-kind album, one that deserves to be remembered as the classic it is.  Their energetic fusion of hiphop, funk, and rock n' roll has been kicking in my CD player for a good 9 years, and it's as fresh  as it ever was.  This is their first album that SUCCESSFULLY shows their  emotive and songwriting range, with songs such as the title track or  Mellowship Slinky that kick as much as anything else they've ever done, but  also with soothing ballads (Under The Bridge, Breaking The Girl) that rank  with the best.  This band, along with Faith No More and Mr Bungle, were the  first popular bands I listened to (I was in grade 2 when this came out).   Watching bands such as Korn and Incubus steal the spotlight with the same  brand of music, it says a lot for today's and yesterday's artists to know  that FNM, RHCP and Mr Bungle are the bands I still listen to the most. It's  just another case of 'often imitated, never duplicated'.   All those people  who aren't sure if they should get Californication should get this one  instead.
6305229449|4.0|Not the best Disney movie, but loved the music &amp; Mushu did it for me.  ALOT better than Hunchback!
0316286850|4.0|Not really what you would call a resource or manual...but, very pretty and nicely put together.  It's a show book, more than anything...not really a technique tool.  His talent is clear, but this isn't on the same par as say  Bobbi Brown's book.  He's a wonderful artist and his book represents that.   A nice addition to a photography/coffee table selection.
B00004R99I|4.0|I was not looking forward to this one when it came out, so I was surprised it was so good.  Excellant music!
B000000I0H|5.0|OK, here's the deal. Up until this point, much of Oldfield's work has been based off of the ideas he explored on &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;: extended rock-based work, which elaborated on the ideas in something of a  classically-inflected manner. On &quot;Incantations&quot;, the tables get  turned. This work is much more of a proper _classical_ piece (in fact, for  all practical purposes, it follows 'proper' symphonic form!) which utilizes  some rock (mainly instrumentation) elements. And musically, this work  actually fits in more with works by composers such as Philip Glass, Steve  Reich, or John Adams; it's worth noting that Oldfield, on his next album,  would even include a Philip Glass 'cover'. This is a tremendous jump  forward from the previous three albums, although Oldfield does presage what  he's doing here, to some extent, on &quot;Ommadawn&quot;. My suggestion,  therefore, would be to go and listen to &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; or  &quot;Ommadawn&quot; first, make sure you're down with some of the work of  the composers mentioned above, _then_ pick this one up...and what's up here  should sink right in. All that aside, this is perhaps one of the best works  of classical 'minimalism' (which is what it more or less belongs in),  easily on-par with the work of other 'serious' composers, and which  actually manages to extend the cellularly-based minimalist concept into  lusher, more complex territory. John Adams would later get the kudos for  doing this, but Oldfield was there some time before him with this work.  IMHO, one of the great 'missing masterpieces' of this style of  music...deserves a _lot_ more attention, but in its right context.
0788805843|4.0|Not my favorite Disney film, but I was not looking forward to this when it came out.  The wonderful music &amp; the character Phil did it for me.  The one problem....James Woods!
0783226837|5.0|This is the only movie I can can honestly say I've seen more than twice and still want to see again. When I'm looking for a movie to watch, and don't know what I want to see, I usually end up watching this one. It doesn't have much in the way of blood, guts, and gore. It tries succesfully  to be funny, and it's just plain fun. It's one of the few movies I can't  find anything bad to say about. I highly recommend it to everyone. If you  haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on a great movie.
B00001QGIQ|5.0|This is great!   One of my favorites.  Excellant music &amp; Jiminy is one of my favorites characters!
6305718954|1.0|I give ths movie a negative 50, not the 1 star I have listed. this movie did nothing more than slash the Catholic Church in every way it could. I was so mad that i had to leave the theater, something i rarely do. It claims that the Church is nothing more than brainwashing people into  thinking that the only way to heaven is through them. this movie actually  rips on all organized Christian religions, but especially Catholicism. Even  non-Catholics should be outraged at this movie for ripping on Catholics,  after-all, if a movie did nothing but rip on Blacks or Jews would we not  boycott that movie, of course, so why not with Catholics? Lets write  letters to the studio that made this and tell them we are going to boycott  their garbage from now on.
6303314015|5.0|This was a great Disney film-the other Lion King 2 video didn't live up to it.  Excellant music &amp; great characters to remember.
B00000JZIK|5.0|Stunning, dazzling, all too true! The movie is a helluva ride the first time seen and then gets better.  But on several occasions, when rooting for these guys, I stopped and reminded myself that these guys are all amoral  killers.  What make this film relevant is the Keyser Soze character who  succeeded brilliantly because he was willing to break all the rules and  bury his humanity, just as legitimate business in the 90's did, and we all  cheered and envied their success. The other relevant portrayal was the  federal agents too wrapped up in themselves and their culture to see what  was in front of their faces.

Watch the scene when Norma Desmond returns to the Paramount lot, where she encounters the Demille unit presumably  shooting &quot;Samson and Delilah.&quot; It has a nostalgic, haunting dream  like quality that captures such a moment. The film has one of the great  endings of all time, absolutely chilling. William Holden hits the right  note as the embittered, sardonic script writer. It's interesting to see a  relaxed Jack Webb, shorn of his wooden Sgt. Joe Friday demeanor, as  Holden's buddy Artie. If you want something original and fantastic, get  this film.
0064471837|5.0|When I was in 6th grade I did a book report on this book and the teacher asked how I could like a book based on death and I tried to explain that it was so much more. It is about love, adventure, and friendship; the death  world that she enters is an added twist even if it seems the basis.
0783113943|5.0|I was maybe ten when Gia died. Needless to say I had never heard of her when this movie came out. But being a huge fan of Angelina Jolie I watched it. After it was over I just sat there thinking (a sign of a very good  movie in my opinion). I had run the gamet of every emotion possible in just  two hours. I felt like I had just met someone quite amazing and they told  me their life story.  Angelina Jolie has proven herself in the past as an  amazing actress, but this film established her as a master of the craft. No  one could have come close to the power she radiates while showing us who  Gia was. I don't say &quot;plays Gia&quot; because it was definitly more  than portraying a character. She became Gia.  I hate when people categorize  this movie as &quot;lesbian/ gay film&quot;, because it generalizes a very  complex emotional human being. Gia wasn't just a lesbian, she was a model,  a friend, a daughter, and a lover.  If you want to experience the human  condition, it's joy and pain, watch Gia. It truly is a work of art. And  Angelina Jolie is an artist.
B00004S6GL|5.0|&quot;Either/or&quot; is still my favorite, but this one is right up there.  I liked &quot;xo&quot; but it took me longer to become hooked.  This one grabbed me from the very first listening.... and it just gets  better with time.  I think the &quot;over-produced&quot; argument is more  applicable to &quot;xo&quot; than to this one, but I don't have a problem  with a musician using whatever tools he chooses to express himself.  I  think his voice is more consistently strong and beautiful on this one, too.
0451191153|5.0|...because I'd read somewhere that the hero committed an act of rape. I was convinced that if I read the book, I'd end up too disgusted by the hero to continue.<br />One day, I opened the book at the middle, and started to  read the story of Gail Wynand's life. I still didn't want to read about  Howard Roark. But Wynand's story was and still is fascinating.<br />Finally,  in order to find out what happened to Gail Wynand, I had to sit down and  read the book from the start. And that's when I discovered that I liked  Howard Roark as a character. It's hard not to like someone who's faced with  virtually every setback in education and in career, and who faces it all  with the courage to endure and with an integrity that appears all the  greater for the contrast to Peter Keating. I still don't like the fact that  he raped Dominique, but I don't feel that this detracts from the plot or  the unique character of Roark. The book says something very simple to me :  be true to yourself and to your dreams, don't let anyone try to mold you  into their idea of what you should be. By the way, Ayn Rand has a great  writing style, too. I wouldn't call this the be-all end-all novel  (Dominique is too irritating) but it's pretty damn good.
B00004KD11|2.0|SHADES OF DEEP PURPLE came out in 1968, and is very much a product of its era.  While there are bits and pieces of the classic MACHINE HEAD era sound on SHADES, it is much more dated than anything else that Deep Purple has  done.  &quot;And The Address&quot; is the instrumental album opener, and  actually shows some classic Ritchie Blackmore/Jon Lord guitar &amp;  keyboard interplay reminiscent of their early 70's sound.  The album's  centerpiece is the hit &quot;Hush.&quot;  &quot;Hush&quot; again shows  flashes of their groundbreaking style (that would not fully develop for  another two years), while still retaining the flavor of late 60's Rock.  Another great song is &quot;Mandrake Root,&quot; which is another solid  Rocker, but any similarities to IN ROCK or MACHINE HEAD end there.  Songs  like &quot;One More Rainy Day,&quot; and &quot;Love Help Me&quot; are much  more typical 1960's era near-psychedelia.  The latter at least shows some  power musically, but is sabotaged by some &quot;flower-child&quot; lyrics  by Rod Evans.  In fact, the biggest problem with the album as a whole is  Evans' songwriting; his lyrics and delivery are very much a product of the  times and they give the album a much more dated sound than is true of some  of their contemporaries like Cream or Led Zeppelin.  Evans had a great  voice, but he seemed too enamored with all things &quot;peace and  love.&quot;  No surprise, then, that he was dismissed from the band less  than two years later.  SHADES OF DEEP PURPLE is by no means a  &quot;bad&quot; album, it's just a very dated one, and sounds very little  like the Deep Purple that most fans love.
6305718954|1.0|This movie has got to be the stupidest movie ever to come out of Hollywood.  Not only do I NOT like how they portrayed Christ, but the acting was bad.  And the people who say:  &quot;This makes me wonder about religion,&quot; GET OVER IT!  Nothing in this movie is remotely close to  Christ's teachings, it is just a big money grab.  Although, I am a Mormon,  not a Catholic, I have no respect for the way they portrayed Christ, whom I  personally believe in.
0671027344|4.0|I thought the book the perks of being a wallflower was a really good book. It spoke of many things that teenagers can relate to. This kid felt like an outsider and had trouble dealing with things of his past and things that  were happening in the present. This book shows how it feels to be and  outcast these feelings are unknown to some people and by reading this book  I think that people will see the people that are outsiders in their  community in a different light.
B00000JCOV|5.0|It's a cool cd, i never really got into ICP, but this is really cool.
B000000ZGO|5.0|If Isaac Hayes had retired after his Stax years, he would have ranked as one of the most important artists in soul music history. But he was just getting warmed up, tossing aside the &quot;book&quot; that he helped write,  creating this incredibly innovative and  beautiful masterpiece.  At the  time this came out, you couldn't have paid me to listen to Burt Bacharach  (sorry, Dionne) or Jimmy Webb (Glenn Campbell! ). But Mr. Hayes' unique mix  of laid-back tempo, lush string arrangements, funky rhythm section, and  smokey vocals, turned those tunes into something unforgetable. This is one  of those rare albums that showed a new path of ever-expanding  possibilities.  And, as mentioned by some of the other reviewers, it is a  damn fine make-out jam.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is not your everyday fantasy book. It blends in sci-fi and fantasy in a way that I, a sci-fi hater, thought it one of the best books that I have read. It has a creative story plot. And every single page is filled  with intrigue and detail. Although some parts might sound disgusting, this  books characters and happenings, make this a defininte must-read for any  pre-teen and older.
0964385619|5.0|This book is a great easy read and helps everyone realize they should be learning how the rich got rich, and stay rich.  Good first step into how too invest -- but this is just the beginning of a learning journey into the  financial world.  So of course the book doesn't go into exact detail how or  where to invest ... there's a lot more too learn which they teach in their  game Cashflow 101.
630575067X|5.0|This movie is the BEST. I watched it over and over and over again. The best part? The big lightsaber battle at the end.Dispite what you may have heard, Jar Jar is not that bad. He's actually kinda funny.
B000002NE4|5.0|The Boatman's Call is, in Nick Cave own words taken from his 'The Secret Life Of The Love Song', 'life lines thrown into the galaxy by a drowning man'. But never has despair and meloncholy been so beautifully and savagely  presented as Cave has done with this album. The bridge in (Are You) The One  That I've been Waiting For, where he sings 'We'll know won't we? the stars  will explode in the sky, But they don't do they? Stars have their moment  then they die,' is so sincere and passionate that it's almost too much to  bare.     It goes on, Into My Arms is one of the finest love songs ever  written, Where Do We Go Now But Nowhere?, a torcherous look at the  breakdown of a relationship - 'You come to me now with a cake that you've  made.... full of glass and bleach and my old razor blades.'Then on to the  final 3 songs on the album, where we are told that 'love is strickly for  the birds, we each get what we deserve', that we anticipate the end of a  relationship from the moment it begins, nothing lasts, everything moves  towards it's end. But by far the greatest song here is 'Far From Me', which  has to be heared to be believed - as with the whole album    This is Nick  Cave going away from his fictional Biblical landscape to reality, and  managing to deal with as well as anyone has before or since. Nick Cave gets  better with every album, since he started off as no less than excellent, it  is some achievement and The Boatmans Call is a testament to this. It will  touch you and torment you, and in a certain mood cause you to question  everyone you hold dear. Take this album to your heart, you wont regret it.
B00000JCOV|5.0|The way that all 9 band members combine the various instuments into orcestrated madness is awesome. I have never heard a better sound to music than Slipknot. The only other bands that I would ever compare to Slipknot  are Kittie, Static-X, and Coal Chamber. It is a great CD. I HIGHLY  recommend it.
B00004RHZU|5.0|this cd is GREAT! you have to buy this cd.  I just bought it because i liked &quot;there you go&quot; but all the other songs are just as good especially &quot;split personallity&quot; and &quot;hiccup&quot;.
B000002J1S|5.0|I had to write another review of this album because my first has evidently been misinterpreted by a lot of people. What I attepted to say the first time around was that although many ignorant people may find this music bombastic and pretentious, it is in actuality brilliant and one of the best compositions of the era. <br />If you are to have no other Genesis album, let it be this one. If you are to own no other album, period, let it be this one. It will take you to new heights of music appreciation and make everything you hear on the radio (including later Genesis songs, ironically) seem like pop drivel. And for those of us who consider listening to an album like watching a movie or reading a book, the Lamb is a gift from the gods.<br />This album, like most of the great Genesis albums, is not accessible upon first listen. My advice is this; do not pay any attention to the story of Rael the first time you hear it, as this will prove too frustrating--just listen to the music. Then, after about 5 listens, break out the sleeve notes if you like.
B000003BF1|5.0|Whether you think so or not, this album is incredible, andwithout doubt, a classic.  If you don't like this album, well thenthat's too bad for you, because some of us happen to love it. And don't argue about billboard charts. If thats how you're ranking a band, then the Backstreet Boys must be much more talented than the Beatles.  Now, onto the album. As I said, it's a classic, even if the numbering is wrong. Gimme Shelter is a great commentary on the hellishness and destruction of Vietnam, and is an incredible song. Love in Vain and Country Honk are fun to listen to with their country vibes. Live with me is classic Stones, raunchy and tough. Let It Bleed (ha ha), is a great song that is actually funny, too. Midnight Rambler has a hot and dark sexual energy behind its bluesy riff. It captures the sentiment of the late 60s very well, with Vietnam and the end of a tumultuous decade. You Got the Silver shows Keith Richards skill as a singer, reminding me of Bob Dylan. Monkey man is one of my favorites on the album, and You can't always get what you want is perhaps a bit overplayed and overused in commercials, but it is nonetheless a great song. What is great about this album is the powerful, hot and distressing energy (its hard to describe) that pervades the album. It is great as a commentary to the end of the sixties, and it will please almost any fan of rock'n'roll, except for maybe a couple narrow-minded Beatles freaks out there.
B000002KAT|5.0|This is probably the great work ever in popular music, marred only by the need for a 24 bit remastering of the rather tired sounding recording.  If I had only one CD it would either be this or Elvis Presly's The Sun Sessions.
B000002UAC|5.0|first, it must be stated that LH,FROM IMG wouldn't know talent if it hit him over the head! amazing how he loathes the beatles, but spends a incredible amount of time talking about them!(perhaps screaming out for  attention that was never given as a child). anyway, on to this offering-  this is classic rock and roll from start to finish, and the critics still  call this one of rocks all time best. all my loving, roll over beethoven,  it won't be long, please mr postman, money, it just never let's up! classic  early beatles!
630575067X|4.0|It's far from perfect, and can't touch the original three but it still a hell of a movie.  When I saw this film in the theatres I was so amazed that I went back a few times more.  And admittedly, it loses a bit of impact on video.  Lets not lose faith just yet, we got two more episodes left!
B00004RI87|5.0|Great album! John Garcia makes of his again!  Stupendous album, with mixture of The Cult, Buckcherry and some Kyuss. FIVE STARS!
B000002U84|5.0|I wonder how differently I would feel about Rio if I had not been a child of the 80s.  This is my favorite pop album, although I may not admit that to some people... Rio was a producer's album that was so 80s it could have  made Miami Vice feel understyled, a record that not only overachieved on  the charts, but somehow managed to outlive its contemporaries.<br />I was just  starting to switch to cassettes when this album came out, and I made sure  that my player's Auto-Reverse was put to work when this was popped in.  I  would find myself rapt in the song sequence, moving seemlessly from one  musical world to another.  Even the move from The Chauffer to Rio was an  easy one, as side 2 would flip over.  It's almost as if the songs were all  written for one another per se--there are very few albums I can say that  about.<br />I have found myself resisting learning the lyrics, so that its  replayability would remain high, and it indeed has, as I can't forsee ever  growing tired of it.  Even the songs that I didn't like so much in the  beginning (My Own Way, Lonely/Nightmare) have grown on me to the point  where I wouldn't dream of skipping a track.<br />As has been discussed, I feel  that John's bass playing is an inspired bridge between the 70s and 80s, and  helped set the stage for the rest of 80s pop bass--and yes, he was truly  one of the influencial players of his time, along with Marc King and  others.<br />An interesting note, is that when I finally replaced my worn-out  cassette with a CD, I noticed that the album had been remastered, although  it didn't say so anywhere.  I much prefer the old mix of Hold Back The Rain  to the current one, it was maybe the one song that I knew could put me out  like a light at bedtime =)
6304578458|2.0|&quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; follows in the footsteps of Quentin Tarantino's &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;.  It's about a hit man, Martin Blank (John Cusack) who returns to his hometown of Grosse Pointe for his high school reunion.  There he meets up with an ex-girlfriend (Minnie Driver)  who he ditched at the prom ten years ago and hasn't seen since.  At the  same time, a competing professional killer (played by Dan Ackroyd) has put  a hit out on Martin, because he refuses to join up with him.  So Martin's  always looking over his shoulder.  Occasionally he phones his shrink (Alan  Arkin) for advice.<br />If you haven't already guessed, &quot;Grosse Pointe  Blank&quot; is a comedy.  This is the kind of movie where people don't  connect very well, so when Martin is inevitably asked what he does and he  answers honestly, &quot;professional killer&quot;, it doesn't even register  - everyone's so self-involved.  John Cusack (who was terrific in &quot;The  Grifters&quot; - a much better film) is appealing, though, in a cool sort  of way.  It's directed by George Armitage, who did &quot;Miami Blues&quot;  a while back - a film I also liked.  And there's a hip soundtrack that  features Violent Femmes, The Clash, and The Specials among others.<br />You  might want to give it a try on video.  It'll do (barely) while we wait for  &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; to come down in price or the next  Tarantino movie to be released.
B000002AS3|3.0|The hype for this band is incredible . I always thought that great bands pushed the musical envelope back by adding new elements to the musical landscape , but Oasis add nothing . Far from being innovative , the music on this cd is derivative and oh so cliched . If their marketing ploy is to reach the lowest common denominator , they have succeeded admirably . I`m afraid the only form of music that they have created is dad rock , or should I say granddad rock .
0783229011|3.0|So there I was, checking out the new releases at the video store and I couldn't find a thing.  This particular video store has this deal where older films are only 99 cents, so I started thinking about what I've missed  over the past few years and I decided to rent the &quot;family&quot; film,  &quot;Babe&quot; from 1995.  &quot;The 'Citizen Kane' of talking pig  pictures,&quot; the cover promised.<br />&quot;Babe&quot; is the name of a  pig, a &quot;worthless little runt&quot; who, unlike his mother early on,  is not destined to become bacon, but instead lands on a farm.  The farm is  run by Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell in a quiet, understated performance).   He takes a liking to the little pig and so does his wife, albeit for  different reasons.  The farm has many animals, all of whom it seems Babe  gets to know (all the animals talk).  There's lots of sheep because it's a  sheep farm and there are a couple of dogs, the authoritarian Rex and a  female collie Fly (who becomes a sort of surrogate mother to Babe).  There  are horses and a cat with a nasty disposition.  And then there's my  favorite - an anorexic duck named Ferdinand.  Even though Fly claims the  bosses eat only stupid animals, Ferdinand is no dummy; he's figured out  what &quot;Christmas dinner&quot; means.<br />The plot has Babe working to  become a sheep dog (or &quot;sheep pig&quot;) and what with the National  Sheep Dog trials approaching, it doesn't take a genius to figure out where  the movie's headed.  But it's the small details, not the overall story that  I appreciated.  Take, for instance, the chapter titles, which are  punctuated by these tiny little musical mice.  One title features an  excerpt from &quot;Carmen&quot;, another a high-pitched rendition of  &quot;Blue Moon&quot;.  And I swear they can be heard giggling at the  title, &quot;Pork is a nice sweet meat.&quot;
0671015206|5.0|The 2 authors gives big spenders an honest look at their life and future.A definite classic.
6305169187|1.0|Anyone who cried at the end of the movie is an emotional cripple who I wish I could manipulate in some way.
0618002219|5.0|This book is a true classic book despite what people say. Anyone who could possibly hate this book even a tiny bit doesn't know how to enjoy classic and well written literature. I'm 13 and have read books by most of the  classic authors including hemingway's &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;;  George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;; Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice And Men&quot;  and &quot;The Grapes Of Wrath&quot;;Kafka's &quot;Amerika&quot;; and  Homer's &quot;Illiad&quot; and &quot;odessy&quot;. These classic books are  the greatest of our time, but J.R.R Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and  &quot;The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy&quot; are defidently better than all of  these. If a person could give anything worse than a 4 star they are  ignorant, fools that don't know the difference between &quot;The Cat In The  Hat&quot; and the great writings of J.R.R. Tolkien. Even a 4 star rating is  worse than what this book deserves. If I could, I would give this book 6  stars.      I dedicate this review to the people who would dare to insult  this piece of art by giving it a rating below 5 stars.
0684833395|5.0|I first read Catch-22 a few years ago, initially put off by the style of  this book. For example, there is no true concept of Time, as you jump  between the past and present continuously. Similarily there is very little  unity between the chapters (when you first read it), as Heller jumps  between Major Major Major's life story in between stories of Milo  Minderbinder. If you are just a conventional reader who is looking for a  fantastic or winding plot, this book is DEFINATELY not for you.<br />However,  what make Catch-22 so great is the flexibility of the novel: I can pick it  up and read any chapter I want to at any time and STILL be entertained by  the events. Each chapter is more or less self-sustaining (save the first  and the last chapters), creating an entirely different reading experience.  With light (and occassionally dark) humor, the novel remains in high  spirits and occassionally brings you abruptly back to earth into the grim  reality of war.<br />I seriously believe if you DO NOT own this novel, you  obviously have not been reading the proper literature all your life. So go  buy it now, I can almost guarantee you will not be let down.
6305627401|1.0|I consider myself to be pretty open minded when it comes to comedy, but the first 15 minutes of this film (that is all I could watch) were not funny at all.... they were rude and obnoxious. Sorry attempt at comedy.
6305176299|5.0|I found this movie very exciting. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves made this movie a movie that I would buy and watch over and over again. I really love Sandra Bullock. It didn't have a boring part in it. It had some really  great scenes in it.
B000003JBM|5.0|For awhile I thought Guru had sold out when he released this. But after listening to it for a couple weeks, I could tell he was just a person who enjoys sound of good jazz like myself. \\"Loungin\\" was the first track that I  really got into and really listen to. It really set the mood for the entire  CD until I got to the track \\"Slicker Than Most\\". An original Guru style  verse over a jazz/hip-hop track. \\"Sights in the City\\" is another one of my  favorites on this CD. JazzMaTazz II is the follow up to Guru's jazz trip  and it is even better than this one. Both are a great buy even today.<br />oNe
6304196938|5.0|One of the best of Hitchcock (although as far as his films go, Hitch probably has the best track record of any director living or dead).  This film is basically the original &quot;Fugitive&quot; and follows pretty closely the plot to his &quot;The 39 Steps&quot; from 1935 - a man is  mistaken for a CIA agent and is caught in a &quot;deadly game of cat and  mouse,&quot; as it were.  I LOVE the music and the visuals that start out  the film  - it makes me wish I had been alive to see it in a movie theater  in the 50's.  And although this film is over 2 hours long, there's no way  you can be bored - the suspense is so intense you'll be chewing your nails  the whole time (I did the first time I saw it).  Cary Grant is excellent as  always, James Mason plays one of the most sinister of Hitchcock's villains  (I would LOVE to have this guy's voice) and Eva Marie Saint looks gorgeous  and plays her part well.  I also enjoyed seeing Martin Landau in an early  role as one of James Mason's henchmen and Jessie Royce Landis (the mother  from &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;) as Grant's mother (although both were  very near the same age at the time).  And I love any film score by Bernard  Herrmann - this guy should have had a mantle covered with awards, but as  luck would have it, most of his scores went not only un-awarded but  un-nominated (as this one did).   By all means, if you don't own it, pick  it up today - and by the way, good job for FINALLY releasing it on DVD,  MGM.
B00000J2KR|5.0|I saw Stanley Kubrick's BARRY LYNDON some 25 years ago at a local theatre and, yesterday, before placing the DVD into my player, I've tried to remember scenes from the movie. And the only thing that came across my mind was the music, the Haendel suite accompanying the english soldiers while  marching against the french army.<br />No need for me to glorify once again  the sumptuous images nor Kubrick's meticulosity in the recreation of the  european XVIIIth century. Other customers have done it a lot better than I  ever could. What I would like to point out here is the extreme accuracy of  BARRY LYNDON's musical score. Just think that Stanley Kubrick, during the  first scene involving Ryan O'Neal and Marisa Berenson, around a game table,  has given us one of the first video-clips ever filmed. The images fit so  well with the Franz Schubert's trio that one is led to believe that Kubrick  wanted to illustrate here a piece of music he liked and that what we see on  the screen was inspired by Schubert's music. And not the contrary.<br />A DVD  for your library.
B000002GLV|5.0|I first heard a cut from this set over AM radio shortly after its 1972 release.  I bought it that same day.  Frankly, I don't hear a lot of jazz in these songs, even though fairly well-known jazz artists are featured on  guitar, trumpet and sax.  To me, it is simply the best vehicle ever devised  for John Mayall's brand of British blues.  Freddie Robinson on guitar cuts  to shreds anything Beck or Clapton ever did (although aficianados of the  two latter will probably think his amp is not pumping enough distortion.)   Mayall, who has never been accused of being a great vocalist, flat makes  his harmonica talk.  The audio quality of this live recording is excellent.   Finally, I nominate this set's version of &quot;Good Times Boogie,&quot;  as John Mayall's finest moment.
052594527X|4.0|I was not expecting anything as I picked up this book except a good read.  I went through it very quickly, and it never lost my interest.  I was ready for a novel set in the 1600's with details of life, not art.  I enjoyed it  very much.
B000003TAR|5.0|After the pop, classical, melodies of &quot;Nevermind&quot;, NIRVANA goes back to where it all began. &quot;In Utero&quot; brings back the punk rock , pure pre-grunge energy that can be found in NIRVANA's first recording,  &quot;Bleach&quot;. This punk energy can be seen in songs such as  &quot;Very Ape&quot;, the totally pschycodelic &quot;Milk It&quot;, the  hard-hitting blast of &quot;Rape Me&quot;, &quot;tourette's&quot; or even  in the beautifully melodic &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;. This record also  has sweet, heart touching lyrics - some of Cobain's best work is resembled  in songs like &quot;Dumb&quot;, &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;, &quot;Frances  Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle&quot;- despite the fact that most  of the lyrics make references to death, diseases and carry on a  maniac-depressive estethic. Being much less comercial than  &quot;Nevermind&quot;, this record is, consequently, much more pure, honest  and raw. The art work -showing the life cicle- is very nice. It is, in my  opinion, the most beautiful one I've ever seen. To end this review, I'd  just like to say that if you only like NIRVANA's hit songs and you never  listened to a whole album, then you probably won't like this one. But if  you're a real fan, this album is absolutely necessary for you. And,  generally speaking, this is one of the greatest albums of one of the  greatest bands of all time, so it is totally worth every pennie you pay for  it.
6305750750|5.0|People don't believe that Anakin Skywalker could be born from a pristine union with the force, and that there was absolutely no way he could save the day at the end of the film the way he did.  I mean, c'mon, that has got  to be totally unplausible, right? But what do they believe in?  Jedi,  laserswords, comical robots, Muppets and Yoda?  Makes you wonder just what  kind of people are writing movie reviews these days.  They're so quick to  accept and even defend this galaxy far, far away but they have to question  a direct allusion to Christ.  I'm just looking forward to seeing Anakin  walk on water in Episode II.  On top of that, we already know he died,  somewhat of a martyr, in vain for an evil and tyrannical emperor.  Then he  was resurrected as a harbinger of death that disenfranchised, disillusioned  and conquered the galaxy in the name of said vile &quot;father&quot;?  Plot  twist?  That could be a possibility - Anakin is born to his virgin mother  through the hand of Palpatine, who reigns as God supreme because of his  son.  Just what is Lucas trying to say?  Look out, because with these  thinly-veiled metaphors the religious folk will be picketing the next ones  until the DVD release.
6305750750|2.0|I just wanted to add to my previous review the fact that I did not buy into the hype at all about this film.  I expected something less than the original Star Wars films.  I didn't expect this piece of Saturday morning  action cartoon surgary fluff.  This movies reminds me of The Mummy:  All  action and no plot.  I enjoyed the Mummy a lot, though.  I didn't enjoy  SW:Ep1 as much since it has so many &quot;deus ex machina&quot; device  saves.  What's that, you ask?  It's where there's no way out for a  character to get out of a situation naturally.  Something unlikely has to  happen to save the character.  One or two for a movie is good.  It makes  for a good sense of suspense.  But this movie is chock full of that and  other unbelievable things.  To all of you that think that this movie is  great, I think you've bought into the new generation of wanting flashy  pictures and sounds and don't care about a real story.  Personally, I want  a story that will carry me away, like the first two SW films, the Indiana  Jones movies, The Matrix, etc.  If you want eye candy, this is a great  movie.  If you want a story, look elsewhere.  (You know, Lucas USED to be  known as the great storyteller.)  Sigh.
B00004LN16|5.0|I must say that it is quite some time since i've been waiting for this new AC/DC album and i'm not at all disapointed.In my oppinion it is one oof the best albums these ROCK GODS have produced in carrier.Sure,it's not BACK IN  BLACK and Brian doesn't have the same power in his voice but Stiff Upper  Lip remains a quality product.  The only thing i regret is that Brian  didn't come up with anything ,fact that i think can be seen.
B000002VQQ|5.0|Patti Smith is so often referred to as the godmother of punk.  I feel this title really sells her short.  She is/was without a doubt an enormous influence on the punk movement but she is/was so much more.  She is first  and foremost a poet - the pictures she paints with her prose and poetry  create indelible images.  Horses was just the first of a long line of  groundbreaking creations from this genius.  Some say it is her best - how  do you rate genius?  It is a masterpiece. Listen to \\"Land\\" and I  dare you to not be moved to tears. Try to listen to the raw emotion and  power that is wrenched from every single note and word, and not have a life  changing experience.  It is definitely an album that any self-respecting  music lover simply must own.  Her impact continues to be felt.  If only she  could find the commercial success she so deserves.   Patti, I love you.
0060977264|3.0|I found the book very much on the &quot;preachy&quot; side.  I like the idea of using story to share one's spiritual beliefs with the world; but for it to work well, the concepts need to be subtle.  <br />On the other hand,  Christians, particularly Catholics, who like to see concepts of their faith  put to story, this could be very rewarding.<br />Despite my misgivings, I do  see a beauty in the author's story-telling style.  I would like to someday  read other works of his.
6305750750|5.0|People don't believe that Anakin Skywalker could be born from a pristine union with the force, and that there was absolutely no way he could save the day at the end of the film the way he did.  I mean, c'mon, that has got  to be totally unplausible, right? But what do they believe in?  Jedi,  laserswords, comical robots, Muppets and Yoda?  Makes you wonder just what  kind of people are writing movie reviews these days.  They're so quick to  accept and even defend this galaxy far, far away but they have to question  a direct allusion to Christ.  I'm just looking forward to seeing Anakin  walk on water in Episode II.  On top of that, we already know he died,  somewhat of a martyr, in vain for an evil and tyrannical emperor.  Then he  was resurrected as a harbinger of death that disenfranchised, disillusioned  and conquered the galaxy in the name of said vile &quot;father&quot;?  Plot  twist?  That could be a possibility - Anakin is born to his virgin mother  through the hand of Palpatine, who reigns as God supreme because of his  son.  Just what is Lucas trying to say?

6305750750|1.0|The video transfer looks AWFUL! Very sub-standard. I'm very disappointed. Looks like a second generation recording. I'd wait for DVD release, or if you own a laserdisc player, bid on the Japanese LD version at eBay.com
B00000BKE1|5.0|OK, so this isn't their best album, but do they really have one, one that is above all the others?  I don't think so, it just depends on what mood your in and sometimes I'm in a Fear Of The Dark mood.  It's crazy to say that this album doesn't deserve the maiden name.  Be Quick Or Be  Dead is a perfect album opener that is fast and heavy.  The rest of the  album is really good with songs that i think are maiden classics(Afraid To  Shoot Strangers,Childhood's End, Wasting Love which is a good ballad  regardless of what people say, Judas Be My Guide real catchy you'll have it  stuck in your head for days,Weekend Warrior).  It ends with my personal  favorite maiden song, Fear Of The Dark and all the songs I didn't mention,  although not maiden classics, are certaintly not album fillers.  The only  thing I'll agree with the cynics about is Bruce's vocals.  You can kind of  tell he wasn't putting as much into it as he had in the past, I guess he  was just getting bored.  All in all, a great album.  Great cover too.  The  only cover I like better is Virtual 11.
B00004SVIK|5.0|The thing that I like best about this recording is the fact that there's so much going on around these guys, yet the performances are tight and and have a the band presence to them.  The mood created by the music is  incredible...and somehow they managed to stay in sync with each other  despite the fact they were playing along with cues, click tracks, films,  puppets, sound effects, and roadies bricking them out of sight.  The  highlights for me include &quot;In The Flesh?&quot;, which is played with  an attitude that Pink Floyd normally doesn't have, and the last two songs,  &quot;The Trial&quot; and &quot;Outside the Wall.&quot;  &quot;The  Trial&quot; totally amazed me because Roger's voice held out the whole time  and never went off-key, plus he had to sing in time with the animation  projected on the wall.  &quot;Outside the Wall&quot; is totally different  than anything else in the show, and I think the whole &quot;barbershop  quartet&quot; approach is great.  As for the rest of the album, the  instruments are loud, the performances are great, and it just rocks  overall.
B00002SWEM|5.0|&quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; is one of the best of all documentaries. It's full of great scenery in Cuba, fascinating people and incredible music. This is a movie that explores the elements of talent,  spirit and showing that how even in your 90s, you can still be alive and  hyper and bring about great music on the stage. We really get to know the  people here, and the film is elevated by the music. This is a happy movie,  an exciting movie that never bores. I come from a family of Latin  musicians, so this movie was very special to me. The Cuban music here is  pure exhilaration and passion. This shows that age never kills talent or  spirit. Incredible film, very fun too.
B00000K2SE|5.0|Hands down, this was the best sf film of 1999. Even the presence of the artless Keanu Reeves works - there are few actors who could more genuinely express Neo's confusion and sense of being out-of-place than Reeves  (perhaps b/c he isn't acting). The superb Agent Smith should have been a  shoe-in for a Supporting Actor nomination - and doubtless would have been  had this not been an sf film. Possessing a truly original plot and splendid  visuals, this film was one of the few must-see films of the year - and one  of only two I gladly paid theater prices to see multiple times on the big  screen.<br />This widescreen release on video more than does justice to the  big screen experience - though it will likely make anyone with a less than  wall-sized TV think seriously of upgrading. Those with DVD players will  doubtless only consider purchasing this movie in that format - and rightly  so - but if you're stuck, as I am, with only a VCR, get this widescreen  version! Being driven as it is by its visuals and luscious special effects,  you don't want the inevitable losses that come with conversion to  pan-and-scan, no matter what size your TV screen is.<br />To sum up, this is a  great film and the conversion to video is terrific. Buy!
B00000BKDS|5.0|This is the type of debut any band should be proud to have.  It has slower songs like Remember Tomorrow and Strange World, catchy upbeat songs like Running Free and Sanctuary, fast galloping songs like Transylvania(great  instrumental, makes me wonder why they don't do more of them)and Phantom of  the Opera(my favorite song from the D'ianno period) that would become their  trademark, and a song with the same title of the band.
B00000JPH5|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was about 4 or 5 and now i'm 16. I instantly fell in love with it. I loved all the characters. My favorite time to watch it is on stormy nights. Now that the Labyrinth has been brought out once  more, I will be buying it as soon as i can. If you love fantasy stories  with a bunch of magic and puzzle solving you will love this movie.
6304039506|2.0|Because I'm a huge fan of Vivien Leigh, I bought this movie a while ago to add to my collection.  It was somewhat slow.  Three times I watched it and ended up falling asleep.  I think I'll just read the book instead.
B00003CWPR|1.0|I and the entire row of people that saw this movie were bored out of our minds.  I actually fell asleep at one point.  The charactors were unlikeable.  The plot was unfathomable.  The &quot;point&quot; was missing.   And, the story was plain, old boring.  I agree with some of the other  reviews - rent before you buy or you might be sorry.
B000002KKD|4.0|I see &quot;Wild Planet&quot; as the B-52's masterpiece as opposed to this debut album like most people, but I still recommend it. Despite a couple of clunkers, &quot;Rock Lobster,&quot; &quot;52 Girls,&quot; &quot;Planet  Claire,&quot; &quot;Lava,&quot; and &quot;There's A Moon In The Sky&quot;  make this album worth owning. Plus, it started off what was, for a few  years, one of the weirdest and most offbeat bands in music history (at  least, for a couple of albums). I don't really see the appeal of  &quot;Dance This Mess Around&quot; though-- it's a bit grating.

B000003PJ4|5.0|The first album I ever bought with my own money was &quot;Eat To The Beat&quot;. I must have been 9 years old and I didn't take the record off the stereo for almost a year. &quot;Eat To The Beat&quot; rescued me from  Casey Kasem and Rick Springfield. I didn't know that girls could get mad  until I heard Deborah Harry rage away on &quot;The Hardest Part&quot;.  There's not alot of overt references to sex, like most songs back then had,  so my virgin mind could grasp the stories being told, for the most part:  Shayla worked in a factory and she was just a number, the hardest part had  something to do with an armed guard and Ms.Harry knew someone who liked  peanut butter and so did I, so she was COOL! I didn't know ANYone who knew  about this album, much less had it or thought it was as great as I did, so  I just assumed I was weird... Now I know I just had good taste. It's STILL  a masterpiece and worth every penny!
0767817486|5.0|First of all, I don't believe that a filmmaker should compromise their beliefs purely to avoid annoying a certain group of people. Certainly, Midnight Express does no favours to Turkey and I notice that, not  surprisingly, a lot of Turkish people are upset about this. However, most  people would agree that this kind of treatment of any prisoner, especially  who is not a hardened criminal but a misguided youth, is simply  unacceptable. And then to change the sentence after the trial... Don't get  me wrong - other countries, even the UK, have done this, but I don't  believe the accusations of racism are founded - nobody should draw back  from criticising any country just because they might be called racist;  although it is based on a true story it is not always true to that story -  the liberties which are taken are there to dramaticise events, not to  encite racism. The biggest problem comes when people try to claim that none  of this happened and that it doesn't represent the real Turkey - well, some  or even most of it did happen, and of course it doesn't represent the real  Turkey - it's simply a dramatic and extremely well made film. Of course  it's biased and there is nothing at all wrong with that - it's a film, not  a documentary, after all. The film features some great performances,  particularly from Brad Davis and John Hurt, a taut and well-written story  by Oliver Stone, and an excellent soundtrack from Giorgio Moroder, which  matches the on-screen events suitably.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I hate this film saga or trilogy, the script is poor, the acting and the directing even worse, i cant understand why intelegent people can watch such a childish and stupid film.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Ranked No.15 on the American Film Institute's 1OO Greatest Films, this is one of the best movie ever made. Though I like The Empire Strikes Back better, this is my second favorite Star Wars film though it has extremely  heavy competition from Return of the Jedi. The cast is wonderful, including  Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Alec Guinnes, whom was  nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The action is excellent such as a  laser fight through the Death Star and a spectacular space fight where  Rebel X and Y wings battle Inperial TIE Fighters and turbolasers from the  Death Star while trying to destroy the Death Star. R2-D2 and C-3PO are  great, as is Chewbacca. David Prowse plays Darth Vader and James Earl Jones  performs his voice, resulting as a great character. I suggest you rent or  buy this film.
6302043158|4.0|this movie is great in my humble opinion. i happen to be a rude girl who didnt know jack about the mod culture until i saw this movie. you dont have to be a &quot;who&quot; fan to enjoy this movie ( i myself is not one), but  if your interested at all on this subculture this movie is the one for you.  cheers!
B00000J7J4|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that is incredible from beginning to end the FIRST time you listen to it. What's amazing is that it gets even better the more you listen to it!  Da Le (the opening track) is my favorite.  Talk  about classic Santana.  I don't get what you guys (who gave this  masterpiece a bad rating) are missing here.  Go get a beer (or something)  and listen to this album again...and again and again!  Another great track  is Primavera.  If you don't speak Spanish, find someone who does and ask  them to translate the lyrics for you.  Carlos, you are definately  connecting the molecules with the light.  Congratulations on the Gram Slam  -- you deserve every one of them!
B00002MZ2C|3.0|I like this album, but very little on here is really amazing. Zach's vocals are fun, but usually somewhat incoherent and, at times, nonsensical (Then again, I hate rap with the exception of these guys). I like Brad's  loose, groovy drumming. Tim's not much of a bassist, but he does the job  well enough. Tom's guitar work is really the best part of this disc. The  extra-harmonized flanger effects on &quot;Calm Like A Bomb&quot; are  innovative and cool to listen to. A lot of his solos, while not terribly  complicated musically, are still cool because of the effects he uses.  Overall, the CD is cool, but will probably get a little dull.
B000002JBG|3.0|I bought the CD for &quot;I Believe I Can Fly&quot; and &quot;For You I Will,&quot; which are the best songs on the entire album. Many of the songs are out of place on such an album, like Coolio, Salt N' Pepa, and Jay-Z  w/Changing Faces. The subject matter in those songs is inappropriate for  the movie.
0316920045|5.0|I have never been able to say of any book that this is the best book I've ever read. I've never even been able to put together a &quot;top ten list.&quot; A couple of weeks after I had finished Infinite Jest, after the  book had had time to settle in on me, I was suprized to realize that this  was the best book I had ever read.  I can't really explain why.  People  complain about the book because it so long, but as far as I'm concerned it  could have gone on another thousand pages. Read it.
B00003OSSL|5.0|This movie was so good.  I absolutely love Harrison, and I cannot believe the reviews I've read on this movie!   How could people be so insensitive!   If you said it was boring, you didn't concentrate on the  main thing in this movie, the feelings and emotion. I was captivated by all  of it.  I don't think it had a faulty storyline at all.  I thought all of  the actors and actresses did an extraordinary job.  I think all of you  people who watched this movie and hated it, should try watching it in a  secluded room, where you can concentrate on it.  Maybe then you can fully  understand what the characters are going through, and the hurt and pain  they must be feeling, and most of all, the relief and happiness they  provide for each other.  I fully intend on watching this movie again.  Oh  yeah, and if for some reason you would like to know, I am only 13 years  old.  I don't know why I was drawn into this movie other than for the fact  that Harrison Ford was in it.  But now that I have seen it, I respect it  for much more than that only fact...<br />          Jill Snider
0307155102|3.0|When my daughter recieved this book from my mother as a gift I thought back to when I got the same book when I was growing up.  I enjoyed it then but I was a little dissapointed when the binding fell apart. Now 20 years later, I see not much about the this problem has changed.  The book is very  enjoyable. We must have looked at each of those pages hundreds of times.   She was entertained with the simple animals doing every day activities such  as bears getting dressed and elephants getting ready for bed. This was one  of our most favorite bed time books until it fell apart.
B000000WF0|3.0|The first song&quot;BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY&quot; may very well be the best song ever made, really and truly!   &quot;Sonnet&quot; and &quot;Lucky Man&quot; are OK. This album will be remembered for two things: 1.it was  their last as a band. 2.BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY. Let's face it, no one will  remember any of the other songs on this CD in 10-20 years. They will  however remember that this was the album that featured BITTERSWEET  SYMPHONY,quite possibly the greatest song you'll ever hear. Anyone who  thinks otherwise is kidding themselves. BOTTOM LINE: Fabulous song,decent  album, worth the price only cause of BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY.
B000002I53|5.0|Many would be quick to tell you that &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; is the unquestionable Coltrane masterpiece, but &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; deserves consideration.  Recorded when Coltrane was moving away from  hard-bop and closer to his own free-form compositions, this album is a  literal representation of Coltrane in the middle of his career, and the  playing shows an all-around gorgeous band exploring the beauty of these  standards.  The most impressive contribution is the bright work of pianist  McCoy Tyner.  Some view jazz albums not as a collection of songs but as one  whole suite; this is an example of an albums that flows in such a way.  The  band carefully waves in and out of the melodies without ever drifting away  from them.  Coltrane does some of his most gentle sorprano sax playing here  that is wonderfully offset by the energetic trio behind him.<br />Those of you  interested in Coltrane who don't know where to begin and are hesistant  about Coltrane's free-form albums that began with &quot;A Love  Supreme&quot; should start with this album.  A beautiful gift to all of us.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This album is too well written. The songs can make you feel good inside at times, sometimes it makes you wanna go crazy and headbang and lift weights, but if your goody goody toshoos like most of the people in Lake Oswego,  Oregon. This album will make you depressed, but you will still get hooked  and then become not depressed and then want to get the rest of his albums.
B00002MZ2C|2.0|Was i ever so digusted in my entire life as when i put my BATTLE OF LA in my cd player? NO!   This techno, softcore, sony-music label garbage left me only shaking my head and asking,&quot;What Happened?&quot;  Was this tecno  hip-hop the band I had grown to love from its conception.  Avoid buying or  listening to this cd at all costs! (except calm like a bomb, probably the  only good song on the cd)
B000001EYO|5.0|I love this soundtrack for one simple reason, I reminds me of the movie. I couldn't possibly expect a music reviewer to comprehend this soundtrack without referencing it with the movie.  It may be an eclectic blend of  music, but it captures the essence of what made The Big Lebowski not a  great movie, but a great film.
B000003TAR|5.0|this cd is that good!  it's the second best of all the nirvana albums. what a pity that the world lost this great man kurt cobain. where is the justice? he had to die(ok he comitted suicide) but britney spears lives. ok  one good advice: buy this cd, it's really worth it.
B00002MZ2C|2.0|Was i ever so digusted in my entire life as when i put my BATTLE OF LOS ANGELES in my cd player?  NO!   The techno sounding, soft core, sony-music label garbage that was on this CD was awful and incredibly disapointing for  anyone who has been with rage from the begining. Email me and I will gladly  trade my cd for pretty much anything.         teamyummyfood@hotmail.com
B000002GK1|5.0|This CD is GREAT. All of Soundgarden's work is superb. I can honestly say I like every song on this CD, not the same, but they'll all great. I really really like Room a thousand years wide. Soundgarden is very talented, they  can make a song heavy without ruining the song, that's exactly why they're  as famous as they're are. Room a thousand years wide never really got too  popular, but it's probably one of my favorites by them.. Also Rusty Cage,  Jesus Christ Pose.. all of the songs are so good. This CD and all others by  Soundgarden are a MUST BUY.
B00003OSTR|5.0|Most will agree that Cooper in Sgt. York and Cagney in Yanky Doodle Dandy contributed greatly to America's eagerness to enter World War Two. That these two movies (and Goodbye Mr. Chips) did more to get us into that war than any other films of the time can be verified by reading Desperate  Deception and Empire of Their Own.<br />The transition of a pacifist religious  peasant into a bemedaled hero is told with tremendous skill in Sgt. York.   An isolationist village and its hardworking youth become representations of  all of America and our duty to help save the world.  The fact that our  involvement in WWI brought us WWII as well as the eventual loss of most of  europe to post WWII Soviet domination of course is not in the film.  But  remembering what happened AFTER WWII should be contrasted with every  sentimental twinge evoked by Sgt. York. Glorification of war and this shade  of heroism has cost us dearly.
B000002U8G|4.0|As many other reviewers have pointed out, the main reason for buying and listening to &quot;Meddle&quot; is the 23 minute Echoes. I used to listen to Echoes almost every night with a pair of headphones, before drifting off  to sleep. I highly recommend Echoes, a good pair of headphones, quiet, with  the lights off. I must have heard it 500 times and I think I heard  something new every time I listened to it. Of course, that was 20 years ago  when I had the TIME to listen to Echoes 500 times. Suffice it to say, I  NEVER got tired of it.<br />Now, on to the information section (primarily for  those looking for live versions of Echoes). I remember seeing Pink Floyd  playing Echoes in some old and obscure movie. I specifically remember it  featured David Gilmour sitting on the ground at some dusty, deserty kind of  place. I think the film might have been called Ummagumma, but don't bet the  ranch on it. All you die-hard Pink Floyd fans, go out and find that  film!<br />The rest of the album is good as well. Unlike some other reviewers,  I liked Seamus.<br />If you like Echoes, you will probably like Atom Heart  Mother and some of their other lengthy trippy songs, i.e. Interstellar  Overdrive, Astronomy Domine, Careful With That Axe Eugene, etc. But, money  doesn't grow on trees. Try Meddle first and if you like it, you will  probably want to invest in other early PF albums too.
B00003CWL5|5.0|I read somewhere that the overwelmingly red look of American Beauty is a symbol for blood and roses. Represented in the film by the flower petals in  Lester Burnham's fantasies, and the blood spilt when the sadness that  hovers beneath bears its face. The title of American Beauty does not refer  to the pretty surfaces that hide the anguish of these people, but the  beauty of their souls when dealing with that anguish. Many reviewers have  considered the title to be ironic, it isn't.    I've heard Kevin Spacey say  that this film is about context, because taken out of context the behaviour  of these characters seem bizzare and even phsycotic, but out with in the  context of their messy lives or indeed anybody's life, it seems natural. If  I tell you that Kevin Spacey plays a character who is obsessed with the  idea of sleeping with his daughter's best friend, a daughter who constantly  anounces her hatred of her parents, a woman so obsessed with appearances  that happiness is but a memory to her, a loner who makes his living as a  drug dealer with a firm rigid father living in denial about his son and  himself, you would guess that there would be no one to like in this film.  You would be wrong. This film is magical in the way it lets identify with  these characters, care for them and worry about their outcome.    Infact  the ideas of American Beauty are nothing new. The persuit of happiness  through the abanodoning of materialistic possesions and the satisfaction of  primal, animal and natural desires was the exact same premise for Fight  Club. This could be a middle aged version of that film. The family turmoil  closely resembles Ang Lee's The Ice Storm 1998, and like that film,  American Beauty ends in tragedy. But as with all masterpieces its not the  &quot;point&quot; that counts, but how you get there. Just like the fact  that anything new you learn in life is the history you don't know, most  originality in movies is the movies you haven't seen and the novel'syou  haven't read. The fact that the film remains a masterpiece is a credit to  the execution of those ideas, not their originality.    Our hero is Lester  Burnham a man who goes quits his job, black mails his boss, and goes wild  for a year. His journey of self-discovery is not what your average citizen  would call moral, yet we still sympathise. My favourite scene in the film  is where Lester meets Ricky(Wes Bently) outside a part. Ricky sells  marijuana for a living and makes a lot of money. Lester tells him that when  he was his age he &quot;flipped burgers all summer long&quot; for very  little money. &quot;That sucks&quot; says Ricky, &quot;No actually it was  wonderful.&quot; The heart of the film is this scene, Lester's yearning for  those years where his whole life was ahead of him, when he believed he coul  do anything, when he wasn't such a &quot;loser&quot;. This purity is the  Beauty to which the title refers.   Ricky Fitts is the boy next door, a  loner who likes to film people. His father is a rigid military man. Both  Wes Bently and Chris Cooper who play father and son respectively give  monumental performance equal to Kevin Spacey's oscar winner. Their family  is a contrast to Lester's, and in its tragedy, emotional complexity and  heart break exceeds it. Ricky's catatonic mother is perhaps what Lester  would have become had he not taken charge of his life.   I have tried to  define this film, but its not a film that can be defined. It is one to be  experienced. If I tell that the sight of a paper bag blowing in the wind  will amaze you, you find it very silly indeed. Acredit then to this film  that when Ricky show us a video of a paper bag blowing in the wind, it is  indeed a breathtakingly beautiful sight.

B00004RHZU|5.0|When I first heard her hit single in January, I was instantly drawn into her sultry, soulful voice and very catchy hip-hop/R&amp;B hooks. &quot;There You Go&quot; sounded kinda like TLC's &quot;No Scrubs&quot;,  but with more edge, more bitterness. Pink is definately a chick with an  attitude. And her debut CD proves it. From the amazing opening track, the  midtempo &quot;Split Personality&quot; (she talks about her many tendancies  to act upon different personalites... very cool) to awesome R&amp;B songs  like &quot;Hell 'Wit Ya&quot; (sounds like it came from Destiny's Child)  and &quot;Hiccup. I especially liked listning to &quot;Love Is Such A Crazy  Thing.&quot; If you want some gritty pop-R&amp;B, go with Pink. With her  awesome voice and hip-hop appeal, you'll be pleased.
B0000027I6|5.0|Let's talk about division.Every Pink Floyd album up to and including &quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot; was a (group-wise) journey of discovery.Beginning with &quot;The Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;, Roger  Waters (for better or for worse) became the de-facto leader of Pink Floyd.  As the chief supplier of 'visions'(lyrics), Waters' excursions of  increasing cynicism became the vehicle of which Pink Floyd would wrap,  alternately, beautiful and (occasionally) harsh music around. Each  subsequent album became nearer to &quot;The Roger Waters Show&quot;.  &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; is arguably the last true group effort ~  although &quot;Animals&quot; is, in my estimation, the last hurrah as far  group participation. Lyrically, while &quot;WYWH&quot; was centered on past  vs. present, &quot;Animals&quot; solidified the &quot;rust&quot; and  bitterness of what Waters was leaning toward. &quot;The Wall&quot; was a  study in self-examination and self-rust.  Then, Waters' keen eye of  contempt focused on the rust of war. &quot;The Final Cut&quot; is rife with  rust: bitterness, anger and yearning through eyes filled with tears.  &quot;The Final Cut&quot; is a springboard to &quot;Amused To Death&quot;.  &quot;Amused To Death&quot; is, after a couple of somewhat mis-fire  offerings (Pros + Cons is sufficient and Radio KAOS has some good moments),  the place where &quot;TFC&quot; left off.A 72+ minute journey into the mind  of an artist still capable of producing an &quot;EPIC&quot; album. Can  David Gilmour come up with anything close to this album? I'll answer for  you.NO :-(Oh! By the way, all you F@#kers who say Waters is a shitty  vocalist ~ I understand and it's cool and all...  However, I must admit  that I LOVE ROGER WATERS' vocals.  Hell ... I love Neil Young's singing  too.  So, there!&quot;The Bravery Of Being Out Of Range&quot;, &quot;Late  Home Tonight -pt.1&quot;, &quot;Too Much Rope&quot;, &quot;Watching  TV&quot;, &quot;It's A Miracle&quot;, and &quot;Amused To Death&quot;.  Waters' vocals are pure gold t' me!BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU HAVE AN OPEN EAR  AND AN OPEN HEART. Let the rust continue...
B000002UKS|5.0|First off, their first album cannot be topped by copying, so if you haven't heard this one yet, don't expect the same great stuff that the self-titled one had.  That kind of ruins the experience at first, and the  tunes don't catch on a quick.  After that initial shock, any true Foo Fan  will be hooked.  The more musical and professional tone of this album makes  up for the loss of the rough sound they started with, especially  &quot;Everlong,&quot; which hits all those great sounding &quot;pain  chords&quot; that make a tune catch.  Also, speaking as a drummer, David  Grohl's drumming is excellent!   This album beats all his work for Nirvana  combined!  Grohl's drumming in this CD writes their old drummer  (What's-his-name Goldsmith)out of existence.  So between more musical  melodies, light-speed drumming, and Grohl's unbeatable song writing, this  album is almost as good as the original.  BUY IT!
B00000JZC4|5.0|I bought this CD after I loved Welcome to the Fold and Take a Picture - The Best Things had just started playing on my local radio station and I loved that too.  So getting this CD seemed like an okay idea.<br />I got more  out of it then I would ever imagine.  I have fallen in love people!
0140177396|4.0|After racking my brains trying to read William Faulkner, I decided to give this short, simple, touching story a try.  Steinbeck is a great author to read after Faulkner;  his easiness of style cures the headache Faulkner's  vortexes of plot development cause.  This novel, which was written to read  like a play, contains the memorable characters of George and Lennie.   Lennie's phrase, \\"Are we gonna have rabbits George?\\" has been immortalized.   This story is easy to read and enjoyable; however, one cannot help to  sympathize with the loneliness of all its characters.  I recommend this  book, but I classify it in the \\"Literature Light\\" section of the books I've  read.
B00000AFHM|5.0|Every so often, you buy a CD that is a &quot;press play, leave on&quot; CD - one that has enough enjoyability and variety to be listened to the whole way through...I found that here.  Some people have a hard time considering  music with vocals of such softness - rock; but the simple fact here is that  this is an album where most of the power comes in the lyrics - which could  stand alone as poetry, and in the subtle and clean instrumentation - which  is nothing less than perfect.  I know that it is already hard to imagine an  alnum so good through all of my flowery, fawning words, but - one listen  straight through and you too will be sold.  This album has out and out,  impossible-not-to-dance-to songs (Dirty Dream #2 and the title track),  breathy atmospheric gems (Ease Your Feet in the sea, Chickfactor, Seymour  Stein- a brilliant song) as well as grinding, undefinable, songs with no  genre or label (the amazing &quot;Simple Things,&quot; and the equally  great &quot;A Spaceboy Dream&quot;).  This is one to buy, because there  really is nothing quite like it available anywhere from anyone - and as the  band shy away from public acclaim (turned down several major-label deals to  sign with small Scottish label &quot;Jeepster&quot;) they strengthen the  unique nature of their sound which has only gotten better with each  flawlessly produced album.  Maybe not pure mosh, pyrotechnic, guitar smash  rock, and maybe not pure troubador ballads - but a great piece of arranged  music nonetheless and an entirely enjoyable addition to any collection.

B0000039QA|5.0|I myself have never liked double cd's, but you gotta give the late great B.I.G his do's because he has really shined with this disk.  He show's us why he is one of the most missed rappers of the 21st century with this  record.
B0000021RG|5.0|This is Chicago's best album, far and above their later efforts.  The talent of each musician is clearly showcased in the unique rhythms and timing that they used.  A live album shows off the capabilities of a band,  and on this album they had no equal.  The only other live album near the  stature of this one is Live at Fillmore East by the Allman Brothers Band.   Live at Carnegie Hall is only for people who have the time to relax and pay  close attention to what they hear, because there is so much to appreciate  here.  I listen to all of it at one time as I roll my 18-wheeler away, and  the miles roll past quickly with this recording.  It's the standard as far  as I am concerned; I have the original LP release, and this is still far  and away my favorite recording.  Bands today don't play this way, with the  funky rhythms and horn section.  Powerful and moving is what it is.
B000002U8U|5.0|Seger combines intelligent lyrics with great rock and this may be his best work. There are lots of hits here, including &quot;Old Time Rock 'n Roll&quot;, &quot;Still the Same&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Nights&quot;. As  much money as those songs made Seger, however, the best songs are lesser  known. &quot;Feel Like A Number&quot; is outstanding and in the car w/the  stereo blasting it's a rock and roll experience everyone should enjoy at  least once. &quot;Till It Shines&quot; is wonderful and &quot;The Famous  Final Scene&quot; may be the best song ever written about a good  relationship that is ending. Bittersweet and poignant.
0684833395|2.0|I read this book because I saw it was recommended by Kurt Vonnegut and then again by Matt Groening in a Life in Hell comic strip, so I thought it  must be pretty good.  It starts out great, but Heller's style is so  repetitive it becomes pretty boring to slog through it.  It would have been  much better if it had been edited down by about half.  My advice--read  anything by Vonnegut instead...even his worst efforts are better than this  thing.
6305750750|3.0|This is only a movie.  So, if you're looking for some hookey entertainment for 2hrs+, then this is the one for you.  But, for those who are looking for some quality film, then might I suggest buying something else.  Here are the problems: first, the widescreen set:<br />i got perhaps the most  boring bit of 35mm film (with that bad pilot with the u-shaped hair).  i  got a worthless little booklet with no real insights into the mythology of  star wars.  but, if you are purist, and you want the widescreen, then this  is the only way to get it.  i'm beginning to associate Lucasfilm with  Disney in my mind: both are a bit too money-hungry with their marketing and  merchandise.<br />and, now, more importantly, is the problem with the film  itself.  I suppose that all the criticisms against the film have been made,  and so i'll not be adding to them in great detail.  But all i have to say  is this:<br />you know there is a problem with a film when, on the one hand,  the director is so meticulous with the cg characters, but on the other hand  can't even decide if obiwan's hair should be either red or brown.<br />the  best part of the film bar none is the lightsaber duel, but why is it so  short?  it's cut together as though made for an audience affliced with  ADD.<br />i like jarjar very much, but please, please!  next time put in some  subtitles.<br />yoda is a puppet.  it's a shame because in Empire Strikes  Back, yoda felt real.  now, he's just a puppet.  woohoo... he can blink.   big deal.<br />but, it's not horrible.  it has its moments.  it's just not  brilliant.  it's main problem is that it's suffering from split  personalities.  ON the one hand, it's trying to be a throwback to the  saturday morning serial, filled with good guys and bad guys.  On the other  hand, it tries to create a more complex star wars universe by making it  more colorful.  So, you ask, what's wrong with that?  i suppose the answer  lies in teh little documentary included in the widescreen tape.  nowhere in  the documentary does one hear about the magical nature of the STORY.  all  one hears about is how great computers are.  well, i hate to sound like a  star wars freak, but that's exactly what A New HOpe was NOT ABOUT.  think  back to Luke in the trenches.  that moment when he chooses to use the force  and not to use the computer.  <br />Lucas ain't Luke in that respect.  And  Episode 1 is not like the original trilogy.  It's just average.  So, go  ahead, buy this average tape.  I don't care.  It's only a movie.  An  average one.
0964385619|2.0|There are some very interesting points raised by Mr Kiyosaki in this and  his other books. They have certainly given me a different perspective on  the subject of money. However, Mr Kiyosaki would have been very well  advised to spend some money on employing a ghost writer and/or a proper  editor. It is a matter of regret that 90% of this book is repetitive,  rambling and boring. He has a valid point when he criticises traditional  education for not properly teaching money management, but it does at least  attempt to teach people how to write properly, something Mr Kiyosaki  unfortunately cannot do. That is not meant to knock him - few people have  the ability to write a book unaided. I cannot help but think of Mr  Kiyosaki's own comments about people in the &quot;E&quot; quadrant who lose  out because they simply have to do everything themselves instead of paying  somebody else to, somebody who can do it a lot better: the characteristic  of a true &quot;B&quot;! Because of the poor writing I believe this book,  and his others, in spite of their good points, will not stand the test of  time.  Nevertheless, the 10% that is interesting makes the book worth  reading, just.
B00001NFCY|3.0|This cd is great but a few songs aren't so good but most of it is good so i just got half of the songs from my prison  cd and half from human clay and putted on one cd.(i have a cd burner) and thats da best cd u can ever  buy so i give this cd a pretty good rating
630575067X|2.0|Darth Vader built C3PO? Gimme a break! Having R2 in the flick was ok because nobody in the audiance ever really knows what R2 knows in any of the movies. But the Golden Droid C3PO doesn't have a clue in the original Star Wars- yet here he is at the beginning of it all. The little kid was  way too amazing, the &quot;Battle Droids&quot; were way too easy to take  out, and Darth Maul could have been a good villain for episode 2 had he  survived this flick. Definately the weakest movie in the series (so far).
B00000J6AG|4.0|A lot of strong musical background can be found in this CD but if you want something with more lyrics I wouldn't recommend this to you. I do enjoy listening to this CD though because the lyrics are strong and the music  behind them is different for every song.  The CD offers a variety of styles  and all are perfected by Moby.
B000031XCR|1.0|The only worthy track Celine ever recorded was the duet with Streisand and it's not here. Even so I would have put on only two stars, because &quot;Tell Him&quot; is not the best Streisand track either. But the voices  together demonstrate two things: 1)Streisand is a really talented artist  with a unique voice that can turn even the most disgusting song into  something worth listening, so good and passionate is her instrument. 2)  Celine is not as good Streisand and she will never be. Singing is something  more (much more) than vocal power. Something much more than making  screaming look as if it were singing. Celine destroys some good songs  previously recorded by other artists. Her originals, such as the Titanic  theme, sound much much better in other voices (try Sarah Brightman's  version in Italian, only then I could tell the song was really good) Her  &quot;duet&quot; with Sinatra is an awfull mistake of both Celine's manager  and Sinatra's inheritors. It's very simple: if you want to hear good  singing go straight to Streisand, Sinatra or Fitzgerald. Just jump over  this so-called diva. One other thing: I can't believe there are so many  &quot;reviewers&quot; pointing out they didn't like the album because among  other things, &quot;Celine is ugly&quot;. What's beauty has to do with  singing? Come on! Go review the album, not the look of the singer.
B00004RHZU|5.0|Perfect! Wonderful! True! The BEST! Buy PINKS ALBUM and be amazed! There SHE goes!
B0000087QO|5.0|I bought this CD about 5 years ago and I have definitely gotten my money's worth. I have many great CDs in my collection, but this one is one of my very favorites. It's a wonderful combination of rock, pop, and new wave.  There's a very good amount of friendliness and playfulness in these songs.  Deborah Harry uses her voice in a way that seems that she was full of  enthusiasm and energy. The music is powerful and strong. A lot of people  are probably only familiar with &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; from this CD,  but those who actually own the CD know that the whole disc is pretty much  perfect. This disc is very fun to listen to, and I know that I will never  get tired of it. I am very, very glad to have this one in my collection.
6305003882|5.0|Starring Leonardo DeCaprio this is a great flim, loved it. About some teens with a drug problem can  Jim pull himself out of his addiction and help save his life with the help of a friend? Parts were funny like in the begining when that dude pukes on the guy. It was a good movie and i  recomend it to every one.
B000006NUW|5.0|Wow! You really get your money's worth with this! Four CDs, over five hours long, and over 100 songs! And not just any songs, either. These are the great Motwon songs! If you like Motown then you know what I am talking  about. The songs are all arranged in chronological order, and it is very  interesting to hear the progression from the rawness and powerful intensity  of the first disc all the way through to the smooth soulness of the last  disc. Of course that's just a generalization, because both of those styles  appear on all four discs. Nevertheless, there was a very clear change  throughout the time period that this music was made. But one thing that is  consistent thoughout all four discs is the excellent, high quality of the  music. The performances are excellent. Yes, there are a few songs that I  don't like, but I guess that that is to be expected in a set of over 100  songs. Despite this, the vast majority of the songs are excellent. And the  sound quality on every song is superb. Even the very early ones sound clean  and clear. This set also comes with a very interesting booklet with lots of  interesting information about the songs and performers. And I bought the  whole thing for under $50. What a wonderful bargain!
6305291489|4.0|First, for the person from the UK who asked what &quot;the 101&quot; is: it is a reference to a US highway, US101, that runs North-South the length of the state of California. The Golden Gate Bridge, in San Francisco, is  part of US highway 101. But there is something fun here to notice: In  Southern California, where Disney Studios and Disneyland are located,  people refer to the numbered highways as &quot;the XYZ&quot; such as  &quot;I took THE 101 to get here&quot; or &quot;the traffic is heavy on THE  405&quot;. In Northern California, where Napa Valley is located, and the  film is SET, people refer to the numbered highways just as &quot;XYZ&quot;,  as in &quot;I took 101 to get here&quot; or &quot;the traffic is heavy on  880&quot;. So, whenever we see a movie which is supposed to be SET in San  Francisco, but people call highways &quot;THE XYZ&quot; we know the writers  of the film live near Los Angeles, not San Francisco!<br />As to the movie  itself, we really liked it - the young acrtress was adorable! However, we  both kept on thinking that the parents came off as really evil: splitting  their kids up, and never letting them get to know each other - we just  cannot imagine people so nasty to do this! Remember, in the movie, the  parents NEVER wanted the kids to meet - it was all an accident, so think  about that! They were selfish people, who NEVER intended their daughters to  even KNOW about each other, or to meet their other parent - just because  the parents were UNCOMFORTABLE with the idea of having to visit each other!  What do you think about people like that? Or how about the grandfather, or  the nanny, who knew about it? How nice is it for them to keep such a  secret?
0790701251|5.0|This is my favorite Kubrick film to watch because it is his most &quot;extreme&quot;-in language, violence, and subject matter. What makes this movie so much better than all other war movies is the fact that it doesn't concentrate on one facet of war, such as a battle, man or mission.  It focuses on the complete process of the dehumanization of men in war.  From drilling it into their heads in basic training, to  &quot;pacifist&quot; Joker wasting the sniper and thus completing the  process. Kubrick really seems to capture the essence of men in the Vietnam  War. Commanders only intent on creating killing machines, soldiers simply  killing for amusement, and no one thinking of the consequences for anyone.  I've read a lot of criticism of the second half of this movie-the battle  scenes-for being boring(compared to the first half) and unrealistic. I feel  I must point out that, after the savagely brutal first half, the revelation  of the meaning of life would have probably been a letdown. As for it being  unrealistic, Vietnam is not just one big jungle, and war is not simply made  up of planes flying overhead and bombs being dropped. These scenes, I feel,  capture the isolation,sense of terror, and ever changing personal  moralities brought on from being in a constanly deteriorating situation. I  hope that those of you who didn't like the second half will go back and  rewatch it. It is certainly worth the extra effort, for it is what makes  this film a classic.
B000001OAA|5.0|This record is a trip.  With all it's grinding guitar hooks and polished electronic effects it sounds like a grungy-goth daydream.  Behind all the sonic show-offery are extremly catchy, very well written songs that are  dark and a lot of fun at the same time.  Take all this into consideration  and you've still only scratched the surface of the excellence that is this  record.  Shirley Manson's beautiful vocals (probably the best voice of  anyone in pop music today) slinking around playfully potent lyrics  (&quot;Hey boy take a look at me/ Let me dirty up your mind/I'll strip away  your hard veneer/And see what I can find&quot;)will get under your skin.   Satisfaction guarenteed?   This record will change your definition of  satisfaction.
6304645635|5.0|This video (which runs for 160 mins) follows rather closely to the classic novel by Anne Bronte (except for the ending - nevertheless, it will still please you).<br />The production is lavish, the costumes beautiful and very  correct to the period of time. The cast very capably brought to life the  characters of the suffering Helen Graham, the scoundrel Arthur Huntington  and the love-struck Gilbert Markham.<br />Tara Fitzgerald appeared a little  miscast, owing to her often unnecessarly harsh displays of emotions and an  unsuitable gruffy voice. But because she played the role of Helen Graham  (who's an exceedingly likable heroine), I grew to ignore all that and found  myself rooting for Helen to find all the happiness she deserves.<br />I simply  love Toby Stephens whom I think, is just perfect as Gilbert, the handsome,  young gentleman farmer who sees the goodness in Helen and seeks to protect  her from the hypocrisy and prejudice shown by his unkind relatives and  neighbours.<br />The cinematography is lush and breathtaking. It's obvious  that this is a well-planned production with no expense spared.<br />I have  only 1 minor complaint - that the romantic scenes involving Helen and  Gilbert weren't made more passionate (the way it should be). Instead, we  see more displays of love and affection between Helen and Lord Huntington  (during their courtship days and early marriage). And to what purpose do  they serve? - Since we know just what a brute Huntington turns out to be  later!<br />If you love this video, please pick up the book (ie. if you  haven't already) - the book fleshes out the thoughts, emotions and agonies  of the love-lorn Gilbert much more effectively than could be captured on  film.<br />Nevertheless, I love this video. It's great to have in one's  collection for repeated viewings.
B00004RHZU|5.0|Pink's first single &quot;There you Go&quot;, has been compared to sound like Destiny's Child and TLC. But, you have to look past that. If you do, you will be very happy. With her first album &quot;Can't Take Me  Home&quot;, Pink surely proves that she is a very talented young lady. her  vocals are incredible. Her album is the type that you can put it on and you  don't have to skip any songs; which is a very rare happening. So, go get  Pink's album. You definately won't be disappointed. Long-live Pink!
0790729342|5.0|I saw this flick in the theater way back when. I've seen it several times since, and the action sequences remain fresh and exciting, even exhilarating. For that reason, it makes an excellent addition to my DVD  collection. The plot is essentially a variation on a Western:  Man-with-no-name type (albeit in this case he has a name) earns redemption  through an act of selflessness and courage. The chase scene, which occupies  the bulk of the picture, has never been topped. It will keep you on the  edge of your seat. And there's even a bit of a twist at the end . . .

0767819179|5.0|This is my new favorite movie. When i started watching it i was like,&quot;this is going to be boring&quot;, but my love for barbara kept me glued to the chair. I am not an emotional person and this movie made me  cry. A lot of times women feel like they have to look a certain way to  please a guy and this movie shows that you do! (thanks guys you've made the  world that way for us). I thought this movie was extremely sad especially  when she left Greg but then my face hurt from smiling so much at the end.  This is a must see for anyone who likes romantic comedies and is a sap for  a typical love story!

0060931671|3.0|It is very likely that to get the most out of THE CRYING OF LOT 49 one should read it through more than once or twice.  This is true of many of the best novels, but Pynchon's 1965 hit would have to be more compelling on  the first read to warrant further examination.  There's a lot going on in  this short novel, but not much to care about, despite the mystery of the  \\"Tristero,\\" a band of secret and ancient European marauders that exist to  destroy private postal routes (do you think they had anything to do with  that UPS strike a couple of years back?).  Our heroine is Oedipa Maas, but  she betrays no indication of swollen feet or patricidal tendencies.  She  and her ancient royal namesake do, however, share the same flaw of HAVING  to know the truth, however much damage it does to them.  Oedipa at least  gets to keep her eyes, for all the good they do her.  See--just keep  peeling back the layers and there might be something grand to this book  after all.<br />Oedipa is launched on the Tristero mystero by the last will  and testament of her ex-boyfriend (Pierce Inverarity--dust off your old  Latin primers) which names her co-executrix.  This requires a trip to \\"San  Narciso\\"--cute, especially when one of the first things she does there is  break a looking glass.  And we're off and flying around the room like the  aerosol can that shatters the mirror.  Pynchon likes to have fun with  character names, too (I kept picturing Oedipa's husband Mucho Maas as  Roberto Duran--not fair to the author as Sugar Ray Leonard must still have  been in high school when this book was written): Dr. Hilarius, Genghis  Cohen, Mike Fallopian, all pretty rich.  So we know we're dealing with  something on a different plane, or, considering the amount of LSD and Jack  Daniels in the book, a different trip.<br />I'm all for stylized prose, and  Pynchon is certainly no slouch at turning a phrase--but the overall effect  seems more obfuscatory than revealing of much insight into human natureor  the early-sixties California lifestyle.  His characters are acid-paper  cut-outs and the plot left me not as interested as I wanted to be by the  end.  The parts of THE CRYING OF LOT 49 are greater than the whole, but  perhaps that's the point.

B00001NFCY|4.0|This is a band I've struggled with a little. I felt their previous work was a little too simplistic for my taste. This CD is in my opinion a great leap forward. &quot;Higher&quot;, for example is both a good radio hit and  a timeless rock classic, superb. Most of the CD flows through heavy melodic  songs that grow and suprise the listener. It is a fun CD. It is well  recorded and arranged. The only real loser here is &quot;Say I&quot;, a  very annoying song. I think the future is bright for Creed, as long as  &quot;Higher&quot; is the standard for writting and not &quot;Say I&quot;,  please.
079073804X|5.0|The Exorcist is BY FAR the most horrifying movie ever made. Yes, there have been some very scary movies made in the past 26 years but NONE can even come close to the pure horror of the Exorcist. A &quot;thinking  person's&quot; horror flick. Minimal special effects and very convincing  acting by Linda Blair. This is not a movie to see at night, alone, with the  lights out. This movie will stick with you for many years to come.
6305265488|5.0|This movie is so good that I just had to comment on it.  Barrymore plays a Cinderella character who overcomes many trials to finally marry the man of her dreams.<br />I am a big Barrymore fan and have seen most of her movies, but this is the best one yet.  If you are not a Barrymore fan you just  might end up becoming one after viewing this film.  She brings the  character of Danielle to life and really makes you feel for her.  The  chemistry between Danielle and the Crown Prince is outstanding.<br />All the  other characters are wonderful and add to the overall quality of the film.   This is one movie that the whole family should watch together.
6305807086|5.0|BEING JOHN MALKOVICH is the most delieriously original, funny, and just plain weird movie in...forever. It's hillarious, unpredictable, with a flwless script, brilliant acting, and fantastic direction. BEING JOHN  MALKOVICH stands as the most original movie out of the year in a year when  movies were more daring then they had been in years.
B00003CX7K|5.0|Could it be that there is an animated movie better than Toy Story?...Yes! Toy Story 2.  It is brilliant, the animation is excellent and the script even funnier than the first movie.  All the old crew are aboard as well as  some excellent new additions.  Plus those cute little aliens get a slightly  bigger part and probably provide the funniest moment of the movie.  If you  think you are too old for this type of movie you are wrong, the humour is  there for everybody and believe me you will laugh.  As soon as this movie  is available BUY IT!
B000005ITX|5.0|I was introduced to this album at thirteen by junior high buddy Bill Loftin, who was somewhat more musically advanced than I. We would sit for hours transfixed by a sound that was different from anything else then  being played. &quot;Alone Again Or&quot; was the hook, but &quot;Forever  Changes&quot; grew on me until it became firmly implanted in my mind as one  of the best albums ever recorded. Now we all can think of albums that we  liked when young that we can no longer stand and wonder how we ever did.  This album, despite what some critics say, is one that stands the test of  time. The song-writing duo of Arthur Lee and Bryan MacLean are at the peak  of their collaborative genius here. Sure, some of the song titles are  outrageous and some of the lyrics seem to have been written merely to  rhyme; i.e. &quot;All the snot is caked against my pants, it has turned  into crystal. There's a bluebird sitting on a branch, I guess I'll take my  pistol...&quot; But interspersed with all the seeming nonsense are many  serious and cryptic lyrics which give the listener pause. Arthur Lee was  &quot;punk&quot; before punk was ever thought of and the music much more  agreeable.  My favorite cuts are the title song, The Red Telephone, Live  and Let Live, You Set the Scene, ...Between Clark and Hilldale (a GREAT  song musically), and Old Man. Bryan Maclean once said in an interview that  the old man in the song was fictitious. Maybe so, but entirely believable.  A lucky kid indeed is one whose life is enriched and horizons expanded by a  worldly man such as Maclean wrote about. I don't agree with those who say  this album didn't age well. In my estimation, &quot;Forever Changes&quot;  continues to stand out from its contemporaries as a masterpiece of  1960s  underground music.
B00000J2L7|3.0|A great Stanley Kubrick movie which balances comedy (laughing in the face of death) and nail-biting thriller.<br />All of the actors do an excellent job and brilliantly play their parts straight (you gotta love the scenes with George C. Scott freaking out -- especially his scene with &quot;THE GIANT  BOARD!&quot;).<br />Kubrick did an excellent job of taking the fear of nuclear  disaster and mocking it. This is one of his best and most fully realized  films, and one can't help but await the day that a special edition DVD with  deleted scenes is released.
B00000IPAX|3.0|Man i really dislike those MTV jerks...just a bunch of &quot;Blink fans&quot; jumpin on the bandwagon. They'll like anything if it's on MTV's Trl or whatever. i hate to admit it but most of the ppl who bought Enema of the States 3 million copies are these people. They aren't true punk fans  like some of us. I just hope that Blink exposes who these losers are  somehow. If anyone has loved and supported Blink since Buddha or Cheshire  Cat and even Dude Ranch you'll know what i mean...Oh yea, as for the cd,  well it's a pretty good cd. it's slowed down a bit though thats why it's  not my favorite but i still reccomend you buy it.
0345423496|3.0|After reading the 2010 and 2061 just so I can finally figure out the whole story behind the monolith, I finally get to read 3001.  It is true what you hear about the book it is not exactly up to Par with 2001 or 2010.  It is a  very interesting story and takes the word Fiction in Science Fiction to a  whole new level, at times I feel that ACC view of the future 1000 years  into the future to be almost simple.  We find the year 3001 technology not  that far ahead of the technology in 2061.  If the advancements made in  technology during the later half of the 20th century, then I am sure that  even if it slows down that we should be much farther ahead of what ACC has  us at in 3001.  This really isn't a big deal, other then the fact that 2001  and 2010 were drastically much further advanced then we are currently at,  so therefore that alternate reality must have a drastic decline in  intelligence in the last 9 centuries.
0783241542|1.0|This movie was good. I liked it very much. It was about some kids who wanted to, you know, do it, because if you don't do it then you're not cool. There were lots of scenes in it that would be extremely amusing  to  third graders. That's very funny. A guy tries to do a pie. That's also  funny. But this movie is also about wholesome values and the youthful  spirit that causes kids to waste their money on pathetic trash made by  people who have the same kind of respect for them that a crack pimp feels  for a ten dollar ho. That's also very funny.
6305750750|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet....like most fans i'd heard this was a comedown from the last 3 but thats rubbish....this film is superb.Neeson and Portman stand out. Widescreen is essential...
6304118392|5.0|In an age where films are carbon copies of the last box office hit there are few films that come from Hollywood that try to say anything. This film doesn't talk to you: it punches you in the face. I have always liked Oliver Stone because revisites different themes at a different angle in subsequest  films. He did JFK and then he did Nixon, he did Salvador then he did  Natural Born Killers. This is his most daring film. Hollywood makes many  violent films, but this one is a little unnerving: a bound hostage is  raped, a man's head is decapitated, 50 innocent people are killed (not to  mention countless prison guards who are tortured in ovens and washing  machines). The forementioned scenes were, unfortunatley, all cut from  Warner Bros. version, whiche is a shame since so many people will not see  the power of Oliver Stone's original vision. It is for this reason that I  recommend the Director's Cut to even those have seen the original. See this  film.
B000003TAW|5.0|the only disappointing thing about this album is that it is only 10 tracks long...but as in pinkerton, this is somewhat of a =w= tradition...i got my copy for a measly $15 australian and cherish it as one of my favourite pop  records ever...rivers has a voice that all teens and popsters alike can  relate to-it can be sweet, funny and aggressive all at the same time...the  soft-loud dynamic ala pixies is used to maximum effect in weezer and  ballads can so easily become supercharged rock outs...note the wacky soloes  eg buddy holly...get this, get pinkerton and the singles, esp. the good  life...trust me you'll love this, and you'll wait for =w= next release as  eagerly as me (it has been &gt; 4 years since their last album...slack  little geeks...live long and prosper...
0790729725|5.0|Martin Scorsese is arguably the greatest American film director of the last twenty years. I have a hard time picking his best film: is it his depiction of the disturbed Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, Jack La Matta's  rise to triumph and his fall from fame in Raging Bull or his picture of the  Mafia between 1955 and 1985. This film is riveting. The actors all work  great together (although I would have liked to have seen Robert Deniro a  bit more!). As Roger Ebert said the film sweeps you through the film to the  end where evrything just crashes and falls down. And, as Scorsese  confirmed, the music is used very well to reflect the changing time  periods. Roger Ebert was right to pick this film as one of the best of the  decade.
6300247120|5.0|Breaking Away breaks from standard American films. The movie is well-written and the plot moves forward at a comfortable pace.  All of the charcters struggle to live normal American (even Midwestern) lives, and they find out that normal is of their own conception.  Dave, a young man,  is intelligent and resillient, yet, he struggles to know himself.  The  theme of bicycling works well as a vehicle (a horrific pun) to carry Dave  out of the stereotype of just another &quot;cutter&quot; or  &quot;townie.&quot;<br />This movie is well-acted and moves from scene to  scene flawlessly.  A great American movie!  Timeless!
B000031WD9|1.0|I like to see films that are shocking, insightful,  new, genuinly funny or beautiful. This film is neither. I have seen both the R-rated version and the Unrated version (the fact that the latter was rated NC-17 is further  proof of the MPAA's ineptitude) and both are tiresome. This being  Hollywood, even the &quot;nerds&quot; are &quot;hot&quot;. There are no  imperfect people in this world. The film tries be offensive and gross you  out; and then at the end the producers try add some morality into the film.  If your going to make a film about bad-taste - have the balls to go all the  way. If you are looking for gross-out comedy, try picking up a film by John  Waters or Peter Jackson.
B000002KCC|5.0|Look no farther, this is as good as it gets in the great long career of Neil Young.  The deaths of guitarist Danny Whitten and roadie Bruce Barry moved Young to write the single greastest statement against drug use you'll  ever hear.  I say this because the record is musically as powerful as  anything he's done and it is never, ever preachy.  Young and Crazy Horse  sound burned out, but that only adds to the raw authenticity.  If you only  own one Young CD, this should be the one.
B000000XB9|5.0|The fact that this music was very popular in the Vietnam War is not surprising. These guys are the best ever! They spoke to generations back then and they still do today. I strongly suggest that you buy this CD!
B000002KDG|5.0|With this album, Neil Young alone among his classic rock peers made peace with and embraced the punk movement that had looked down on them so disdainfully.  &quot;This is the story of Johnny Rotten,&quot; he sings at  one point.  Indeed, but the album also includes two great songs  &quot;Powderfinger&quot; and &quot;Pocahontas,&quot; that explore the dark  side of American History.  It starts out accoustic and then plugs in for  some great guitar jams halfway in.  An absolute classic.
0767819594|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVE MOVIES. IT'S SOOOOOO GOOD! RYAN PHILLIPPE'S ACTING WAS REALLY GOOD AND HE LOOKED DELICIOUS!(WON'T GO INTO THAT!) REESE WITHERSPOON WAS REALLY GOOD AND LOOKED BEAUTIFUL, SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR'S ACTING WAS AMAZING, SELMA BLAIR WAS REALLY FUNNY AND THE SOUNDTRACK IS ACE! LET ME GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE THOUGH, DO NOT, I REPEAT NOT WATCH THIS WITH  YOUR PARENTS(IF YOU'RE UNDER AGE) AND GO RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE! BUT IT'S  BETTER IN ENGLAND BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE TO BE 15 TO WATCH IT!
B000002LMK|5.0|Ragged Glory is Neil Young's best album since &quot;Rust Never Sleeps,&quot; and not coincidentially the most rockin'.  That a bunch of forty-ish hippies who should have followed Young's advice and burned out  long ago could produce a guitar dominated album of such intensity is simply  astonishing.  Most surprisingly, tucked amid the walls of guitar fury are  some of the prettiest melodies Young has ever written.  Standout tracks  include &quot;Over and Over,&quot; &quot;Country Home,&quot; and &quot;Days  That Used to Be&quot;  An absolute classic.
B00004S6GL|3.0|Though I enjoyed Elliot Smith's latest, I do feel that this album cannot touch Either/Or, which I feel was his most brilliant.   The more I listen to this latest release, the more it grows on me.   I feel this album rates  the same as XO, thought the sounds are very different.   Any of his fans  will enjoy it, though how much they enjoy it will vary
B000002KCI|4.0|Young and Crazy Horse have done so many fine albums that this one sometimes gets overlooked.  Most fans know &quot;Cortez the Killer,&quot; but check out &quot;Barstool Blues&quot; (wonderfully redone on the live  &quot;Year of the Horse&quot;), &quot;Don't Cry No Tears&quot; and  &quot;Pardon My Heart.&quot;  The sound alternates between soft and hard.  A strong effort that is among the better Young albums.
B00000AFWW|5.0|This album is great! I bought it after hearing &quot;Malibu&quot;. It's quite differnt from &quot;Live Through This&quot;. All the songs on this album are great, so if you like any song you've heard on the radio,  &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, &quot;Malibu&quot;, or &quot;Awful&quot;, for  example, you will love the album. One of my favourite songs are  &quot;Northern Star&quot; (not to be mixed up with Mel C's song with the  same title). This is one of favourite albums! Buy it!
6302424739|5.0|This is a very well made film!  It has such a nice story and makes you think. This is my favorite Anne Bancroft film! She gives a very honest performance.  Hopkins is just as good, and fans of Silence of the Lambs  won't believe what a nice guy Hopkins can play!
B00000F1D3|4.0|I am a fan of Cher and have heard most of her songs (Have anybody heard all, including all her covers in the 60's and 70's?). This album is very not typical for Cher. There is none of her Geffen-era or &quot;It's a man's  world&quot;-sound left. This is a disco album. If you like disco music,  dance music, buy the album. If you like Cher, you might like it too,  because of her voice and some of the songs are very good, I can't deny  that. But I can not give it 5 points like most of her other albums. Buy it  if you like the songs you've heard on the radio. But I don't like the cover  of &quot;We All Sleep Alone&quot;
6305428298|5.0|This is one great film.  I was amazed after the first time I watched it! This is by far Michael Caine's best film.  Jane Horrocks as LV was incredible!  This film was very entertaining and had a good message.  Films like this don't come along often enough.  Why the Academy Awards did not  nominate this film, I just don't know. Caine won the Golden Globe Award for  this performance and rightly so! See this!
B00000DGUY|5.0|This album contains all of Dire Straits big hits. I don't think there's any song I don't like on this album. The last song of the album is a live versin o &quot;Local Hero&quot;. That song is just fantastic! And track 15,  &quot;Your Latest Trick&quot;, also live, is great too. It sounds lika a TV  theme, like &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;.  If you like any song you've heard by  Dire Straits, you'll love this album!
B000003S0P|5.0|This recording, for me, puts it all together before Fripp decided to retire the name of King Crimson for 6 yrs. Last night,I sat down with a few younger co workers who are mostly in their early 20's (I'm 43) who listen  to the likes of Metallica. By the time Starless was halfway through, they  sat there speechless. When i told them they were listening to something  that was recorded before they were born, they were amazed, and glad to know  that it was still available. This is by far, the heaviest recording they  did, but to call it heavy metal is hardly an accurate description. These  guys really knew how to lull the listener in and bash him over the head at  just the right moment. Another great thing about this record is that it  calls back to their earlier releases with the inclusion of both Mc Donald  and Collins on saxes, as well as Mark Charig on cornet, who did such great  work on the title track of Islands. Starless remains in my mind as their  greatest piece ever, with they way it opens with a errie, haunting melody,  and then slowly builds into one of the most effective, repetitive guitar  solos ever put on tape. Just when you think it's reached it's peak, off it  goes into another direction of wild Jazz, and then thundering back to the  original melody. I hope that Fripp and company decide to include this  masterpiece in their live shows next time around.
B00001NFCY|5.0|This CD is so awesome. I like all of the songs except for Inside Us All. My favorite tracks are What If, Beautiful, Wrong Way, Never Die, and Higher. If you are a fan of heavy rock with positive and thoughtful lyrics  you should really like this band. I also recommend My Own Prison and  any  Metallica(didn't sellout) and Pantera albums.
B000003S0F|4.0|I became a fan of this band in my early teens. I loved the first album and still do to a certain extent. The second one, after many years comes off a sounding like out takes of the first, till you get to Cat Food. Then along  came Lizard, with it's flawless production and very little guitar. People  tend to love or hate Lizard as is the case with Islands. When I first heard  it at the age of 14, it confounded me and I put it away for a while.  Repeated listenings have revealed that while it may not be their greatest  work, it certainly is one of their most original sounding recordings. The  Sailor's is spellbinding. As for those who tend to gripe about their  lyrical content, you seem to miss the point that in most prog-rock, the  lyrics don't matter much. It's much more about fusing different styles into  rock and making it work. It's really kind of tough to diss a band that has  NEVER really strived for pop success. This album, for me shows the band at  a crossroads. It creates a kind of springboard into the next phase which  produced 3 top notch albums. Lark's Tongues In Aspic, Starless And Bible  Black, and finally, Red. Islands will always remain on my playlist, as does  most of the King crimson catalog. The sax and guitar solos on The Sailor's  Tale, along with the stunning coronet solo on the title track, are worth  the price of admission alone.
B0000029PC|5.0|without a doubt this is one of the best complete recordings of schumanns symphonies i have ever heard and the sound quality is superb these are well worth the money
B000003TAW|5.0|Like the title said. This is one of the best cds ever produced in my opinion. They have their own style that is rock but not heavy. Just satisfying. That is the best word i can describe it with.<br /> Their songs are all catchy but not &quot;annoying&quot; catchy. They have lots of good  guitar intros and solos which i like. <br />I bought this cd in elementary  school and still listen to it and i am a junior now. It so good that when  you listen to it, you dont even have to skip around because all of their  songs are good. You can just listen strait through. I think all cds should  be like this. However there is always that one song you skip when listening  to a cd. Not in this on though. They have another cd that isnt as good.  Some people would disagree with me, but i stand by my opinion. The original  is the best. Buy it. You wont regret it.
B000002H97|5.0|Korn, Limp Bizkit, Blink 182, Nsync, Kid Rock, METALLICA....  Those names sound familiar with almost everyone, right?  But Metallica, unlike the others, was never popular comercially  until this album.  Until then, they  were known only as trash metalists focused on world domination, and they  rarely had any help from radios or MTV.  Some say it's good, othgers hate  it.  As far as I see it, what really matters is that they never lose the  rage, power, and individuality that separated them from everyone else back  in the 80's.   Anyway, about this album.  Notice that songs like the  Unforgiven and even Enter Sandman hint at what was to come with Load and  Reload, their softer and less aggressive than their preceding hits; Fight  fire w/ Fire, Battery, One, etc.  However there's also songs like Holier  than Thou that keep the rage of their 80's music.  Then there's songs like  Sad but True that have all the depth and power of their old stuff.  All in  all, this is still a CD that must be owned by every  Metallica fan.
630575067X|5.0|Like millions of other fans of Star Wars I was angry at the reviews its had because peoples expectations were too high if your going to see it go in with an open mind. Everyone has a go at Jar Jar Binks for being so  anoying but he dosen't play a massive part in the film. The lightsaber  fight at the end is brilliant its very fast. I can't wait for Episode II  and III to come out- I will be first in line for those.
B000001ESF|5.0|The genuis writing of Neil Peart was finally seen with the release of this album, as were the composing ability of Geddy and Alex.  No album has ever come close the reaching the scope of this album, from anybody.  The story  of 2112 is absoulty one of the most powerful yet close to home, story's  ever put forth in Rock.  The Remastered version should be a must get for  anybody that has ever listened to this album.  It contains the original  dialoge and lyrics, not released with the album since the original album in  1976.  To those who want the whole story of this album, this a MUST GET!
B00003Q438|5.0|As a film, The Abyss a great big, emotional roller-coaster ride, somewhere between an action film and an epic, exploring the heights and depths of archetypal, primal fears, human frailty, compassion, trust and, yes, love.  On top of this engrossing story is one of the most ambitious filming  projects ever, shooting forty percent of the movie underwater, in a 7.5  million gallon nuclear containment structure. As the supporting materials  in the DVD set make clear, this film was an ordeal for all involved, and it  seems many sensed they were involved in something unique. It seems to me  that the DVD reflects the desire of someone who was deeply involved in the  project to convey exactly what a white whale of a quest this &quot;son of  a-byss&quot; was. <br />Beyond well-done, beyond 'full of special features,'  the two-DVD set is an encyclopedic archive of this film and its making;  even The Matrix DVD is skimpy by comparison. First of all, the DVD does  what the Blade Runner Director's Cut DVD should have done but failed to:  offer the viewer both the theatrical version and the expanded special  edition. This was an excellent decision because while several of the scenes  only in the special edition add greatly to the character development and  story, the expanded &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;-esque ending  is even more of a non sequitur than the too-abbreviated theatrical ending.  But that's just the beginning. The DVD includes: two documentaries,  totaling 1'10&quot;, on the films making; the twenty minute special effects  reel submitted to the Academy for Oscar consideration; numerous other  production video clips; several hundred (maybe over a thousand) images,  from effects stills to shots of many of the individuals who invested a lot  of themselves making this film; the complete script; Cameron's sixty-page  original story concept; and the complete set of storyboards for the film  (another 700+ images).<br />This DVD set is so voluminous that it clearly  exists more than just to entertain the user. I think someone meant to  produce and exhibit a monument to an astounding production.  That person  has succeeded. My hat is off, both to those who made this film and those  who brought the ordeal behind the ordeal to light by producing this  unparalleled DVD set.
6303014100|5.0|This movie was great!      It made me want to know more and more about the Civil War( I'm 13).   Some people may find it boring, but I think it was cool.   You really should watch it
B000002C1X|5.0|I'm only 16 and I know this album is amazing- every song is great.  Not only is the music the best, but meaning is great.  It goes beyond music, into poetry and symbolic meaning.  You don't get that from too many albums.   It sold 23million+, and its a double album.  Here's my Pink Floyd  order:<br />1.Dark Side of the Moon (tied) 1.The Wall 2. Wish You Were Here 3.  Animals 4. Division Bell<br />The Wall is one of the best albums of all time-  if not the best, and any real rock fan should own this album.
B00000DC4A|5.0|This is the best album of Adams' career. He finally subdues his usual cheesiness in favor of some songs with substance. Tunes like &quot;How Do You Feel Tonight&quot; and &quot;Cmon Cmon Cmon&quot; are beautifully  crafted songs, that impress with their subtle nature, while songs like  &quot;Cloud #9&quot; and &quot;Before the Night is Over&quot; are a  throwback to the classic Adams' sound. Overall, the album is just extremely  solid and a great listen.
B000001Y42|5.0|This is straight up metal that's rapped over. No guest rappers, no singing (not any good singing anyways), just music to mosh by. &quot;Faith&quot; may be their breakthrough hit, but it's &quot;Counterfeit&quot; that really  deserved the hype. Listen to the lyrics carefully, it's about a poseur who  tries to act 'down'. Fred Durst is wailing at him like, get your own  culture. Now that Limp Bizkit is a household name, guess what everyone has  dubbed Fred Durst as? Yes, he may be his own worst enemy, but this isn't  MTV, this is about music not image. Now that it is about image, they get  flak, maybe unfairly too. Songs like &quot;Stuck&quot;, &quot;Nobody Loves  Me&quot; and &quot;Stalemate&quot; show a very hungry band that can rock  better than most, and they do it with ease as well. &quot;Leech&quot; shows  a band attempting thrash, they do it nicely too. In the end, the hunger in  the band proves why they are were they are now. Their songs may be slower  now, and all over (ugh) MTV, but it shows why their aggro women bashing  (not that that's a good thing) rap/metal make them the most copied band in  America. Nevermind what I just said, it's Anthrax and Rage Against The  Machine everybody is ripping off, then they turn it politically incorrect.  Still, this is a strong debut by a band that is everywhere, they may never  be legends like Nirvana or Nine Inch Nails, but at least it's fun, and in  the end that's what matters.
B00000JG41|5.0|I purchased the self-titled debut when it first came out.  I wasn't ready.  I took it out of my tape player and allowed it to grow dusty in my bins.  In it's place, I put in whatever Rock band of the moment I was into. You  guys got me though.  I've been a huge fan of Faith No More's jazzy, easy  listening tunes.  I was frustrated with FNM's breakup, and I was trying to  find some way to continue to hear the brilliance of Mike Patton.  After  reading all that had been said on this board, I not only plugged the  self-titled tape back into my tape player, but I went out and bought  California...WOW!   Upon first listen, Air-Conditioned Nightmare blew me  away, and the more I listened to it the more I got into the other songs.   All the compliments have been listed below, if you're even slightly  intrigued, but let me say one thing...if you're more interested in art than  simple songs, Mr. Bungle's California is the album you've been searching  for all along...I cannot believe this album hasn't gone multi-platnium.  I  don't know who this incriminates; Warner Bros?  The people who would rather  hear the Backstreet Boys or Mariah Carey or Britney Spears?  Or possibly  Mr. Bungle themselves for maintaining such a low profile?  I have no  idea...But my confusion stems from the incredible quality found on this  album!
0690043961|5.0|We read this book after Brown Bear and Polar Bear and about the same time as Hungry Caterpillar.  While my 2 1/2 year old son, Brian, loves all of  his Eric Carle books, he's particularly taken with this mixed-up chameleon.   From the first page, there are already new concepts to grasp, such as  seeing the chameleon turn &quot;brownish&quot; after it moved onto a  &quot;brown&quot; tree, &quot;reddish&quot; on a &quot;red&quot; flower,  and &quot;yellowish&quot; on the &quot;yellow&quot; sand.  That's just Page  1.  Subsequently, Brian would then read out loud, how &quot;I wish I could  be HANDSOME like a flamingo,&quot;...&quot;smart like a  fox&quot;,...&quot;funny like a seal&quot; at which point he'll go  &quot;hahahahaha&quot;.  He's only had the book for 3 weeks and he's  already &quot;reading&quot; almost the whole book by himself.  The story  has a moral to it too, about how the chameleon, after wishing to be all the  things it wasn't, ended up so mixed-up that it finally wished &quot;I could  be myself.&quot;  We have great fun reading about the chameleon together,  as we do about the other Eric Carle characters: hungry caterpillar, brown  bear, polar bear, and little cloud.
6305750750|5.0|Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace was not only the most anticipated movie of perhaps all time, but it was also the best. The charactors were fantastic, the special effects were unbelievable, and the plot was  excellent. The CG charactors like Jar Jar, Watto, and Boss Nass were so  real that they blended in perfectly. Personally, I'm sick of hearing all  the bad reviews about this movie. Why can't we sit back and just watch an  excellent film?
B00003CWMI|5.0|I had no idea that this would be such a heavy hitting movie. I laughed and I cried. I would recommend this movie to people of all ages, all colors, religions, etc. It teaches that we are all one. Major kudos Mr. Williams.  You've done it again. You may joke around, but you really wallup a heavy  punch. Thanks for the lesson in humanity.  JMHO //(*_*)\\
6300216047|5.0|Quite possibly the campiest film ever made.  It's great, especially the beginning.  The movie is just great.  It's funny, the acting is funny, Jane Fonda is great; Anita Pallenberg is great.  A must see.  SEE IT!
B00001U0GQ|5.0|i enjoyed Mann's reworking of the elements.  I saw his main purpose to strengthen the snubbed brit beau character. the full effect is a much more powerful sacrificial death scene at the huron hands and more noble.  it  also redeems him fully for lying to cora's father at the fort.<br />the fort  battle scenes have been lengthened and creates an epic stage for the story  to unfold.<br />also, russell means' wonderful speech at the end is left to  play out.  <br />having both versions, i appreciate them as different and  strong films.  Mann has def. reasons for the changes and they can be seen  as none are gratuitous or determental to the film. i love the original cut  because that is the one i saw on the big screen.  i also love the dvd cut.   also, a testament to the power of editing and a testament to one of  america's greatest directors.<br />the dvd is worth a look and def. worth  buying if you are a fan of this movie or director.
0679759328|2.0|This is yet another excercise in semi-autobiographical snoring by an otherwise capable writer.<br />Why do they DO this? Yeah, yeah, the writer's life is a lonely one, full of self-doubt, sackcloth and ashes.<br />Our hero,  Edith, is in a self-imposed exile at some stuffy old hotel, doing penance  for an errant love affair. She takes long walks, broods, takes more long  walks, broods some more. Meanwhile, the only diversion for the hapless  reader is a collection of societal parasites killing time at the same  hotel.<br />Give this one a wide berth.
B0000035E7|5.0|&quot;BLEACH&quot; is a classic. If you are a Nirvana fan then i seriously suggest that you buy this album. This is definately their most raw album &amp; in my opinion can only be bettered by &quot;In UTERO&quot;. Kurt has  a way of making simple songs sound so raw, emotional &amp; non-repetitive.  This is the kind of music you can never get bored of.
B000002U82|5.0|Okay, I'm not sure how it was done, but if any band could do it, it had to be Pink Floyd.  For the six or seven of you who don't know, Pink Floys not only made an album with great songs + hypnotic tunes, but a soundtrack, as  well.  Try starting this CD on the third roar of the MGM logo in THE WIZARD  OF OZ.  You'll be surprized, and I guarantee that you'll have a whole new  appreciation for this album.
B000002LUB|5.0|Dehumanizer is an excellent release. Dio and the other men from Black Sabbath never sounded better. Basically, this is what you want to hear. While Computer God and TV Crime are the most noteable songs, you can listen  to the whole thing straight through. Dim the lights- this album might scare  you...
0553573411|5.0|Hobb has created a stunning sequel to her fantasic book &quot;Assassin's Apprentice&quot; that immerses the reader even further into the world of Fitz and the Fate of the Six Duchies. I found that this was my favorite (if I must pick) of the three books. The action is fantasic, new twists are  added, along with more romance, but not enough to ruin the book. This is a  must read-but only after the first!
B000002H6C|5.0|is the best I have ever hear from metalica since the black album, but I still like better &quot;Metallica&quot;
6300274268|5.0|SHAME ON YOU, HOW DARE YOU GIVE THIS MOVIE LESS THAN 3 STARS. This is one of Walt Disney's greatest movies he has done. WHY ARE YOU CRITICIZING IT? The voice acting was incredible that it blew me away. It also had excellent picture quality. My favorite part of it is the flowers singing &quot;Golden  Afternoon&quot;. That part was very cool. HERE IS MY ADVICE, IF YOU DON'T  HAVE THIS MOVIE, BUY IT TODAY!
B00004SVID|5.0|&quot;The WALL&quot; has successfully passed the test of time extremely well. I'll never forget the first time I heard the original studio album. I was thoroughly blown away. When I heard that a &quot;Live&quot; version was  being prepared for release, I was a bit skeptical as to why. There was  already a studio version, a film version, and the Roger Waters version both  on C.D. and video. So you can imagine my surprise when I popped this disc  into my player.... it was like hearing it for the first time.... again!  That sence of discovery and excitement one gets that first time was there  in all it's glory. I actually like THIS virsion best of all. The energy  that comes from a &quot;LIVE&quot; performance gives the entire work a  quality not found on the other versions. The sound quality is spectacular,  and the two booklets are a real bonus. Not only do you get some wonderful  shots from the concert, but each one of the band members, as well as the  key people behind the production; share some insight into this mammoth  piece of &quot;Rock Theater&quot;. The band is in top fourm, and actually  extend many of the songs with some jammin' Pink Floyd style. This disc is a  must for anyone who loves the band, and may change a few minds (myself  included) who may think a &quot;LIVE&quot; recording of this opus could  possibly add anything new. This MAY be the most important brick IN the  WALL.
B00004SVIK|5.0|The Wall has finally been released live!My only question is ,why the delay?The Floyd sound fantastic.Its a must have for any true Floyd fan. The highs are without question,Mother,Run like hell,and of course the  Trial.Live these songs have so much energy.It is great also to hear Waters  and Gilmour trade vocal leads on Comfortably Numb and Run Like Hell.Like I  said... Finally!
B00002Z88D|5.0|Metallica is the best heavy metal/hard rock band, and this album shows it very well. The orchestra works better with the classic songs, like for &quot;whom the bell tolls&quot;, &quot;master of puppets&quot;, &quot;the  thing that should not be&quot; and &quot;one&quot;, works pretty good with  some recent songs, such as &quot;devils dance&quot; and the fabulous  &quot;The outlaw torn&quot; (in my opinion their best song ever), and not  so well with other recent songs (&quot;fuel&quot; and the memory  remains&quot;). However, if you are not a real fan, if you dont have all  of their cds(or at least dont know all their songs), you will probably  think that this is a weird album, due to the orchestra arrangements. To  finish, Id like to remind listeners of just how great are the new songs,  specially &quot;No leaf clover&quot;, and what a pitty it is that some  songs like &quot;where the wild things are&quot;, &quot;FiXXXer&quot; and  &quot;blackened&quot; were not included.
B00004RHZU|5.0|I just don't like this cd...I love it! The whole cd has songs for everyone. Pink did a great job mixing the genres of hip-hop, altrenative, pop, r&amp;b, and jazz into her cd. I bought this cd yesterday after only  knowing of one great song (There u Go) and fell completely in love with the  rest of it. Buy this cd you won't be disappointed.
B00000IQW5|5.0|A very warm and mystical movie.  Mr. Spielberg has made a film that will tug at the hearts of those who just want to cozy up and share a tear or two with someone special.
0440219078|4.0|This is a really deep, interesting, and strange book about a society that has never experianced love, hate, or even color! This book moving, and I strongly recommend it. It will make you think!
6303187064|5.0|Many people say the Crow is a film where style pushes out the substance and I suppose I can see how they would think that. But I have to disagree. Yes the Crow is a very visual film but once you get past that you find a  lot more than you first thought.     Alex Proyas, a fairly unknown director  at this point, has done an amazing job of transfering James O'barrs comic  creation from page to screen. He has created a comic book world that is  full of beautiful and disturbing imagery. The film is practically black and  white so when a colour does break through it makes a big impact. He directs  the action and the romance with equal precision.He knows how much of each  to give you and when to give you it. HE does an excellent with his  actors.He gives them quite a lot of space to work in but doesn't let them  drift too far into caricatures. Which brings us onto the performances.This  was to be Brandon Lees big break.Unfortunately it was not to be but his  performance as the tragically undead Eric leaves us in no doubt that he  would have been a welcome asset to the ranks of Hollywood stardom. His is a  part that could have been done very badly but Lee shows just the right  amount of sadness and vulnerability to go with the rage and hatred his  character is suffering. It is a surprisingly powerful performance for  someone who spent most of his previous films beating people up and giving a  clever line afterwards. Thats not to say there isn't plenty of action in  the Crow. Action is plentiful and expertly executed by Lee but Proyas  doesn'tlet it draw away from the storyline. The supporting cast all give  memorable performances,especially Micheal Wincott as the head bad guy and  Rochelle Davis as Eric young friend. They all help add to the overall  feeling of the film.    What is a very important aspect of this film is the  music. The score and the soundtrack are both perfect and set the mood and  atmosphere brilliantly. The music is just as important as anything else inthe film. The standout tracks being The Cure's 'Burn' and The Nine inch  Nails 'Dead souls'.    There is no getting away from the fact that this is  an action film but it is an action film with a soul. The Crow has a lot  more feeling and passion than most of the so-called romantic films we get  these days.You feel the tragedy of the situation. Love and hate play just  as big a part as the violence. In fact without one of these factors the  film would not work.    The Crow is a fantastic film and a fitting tribute  to Brandon Lee's talents.
B000002LGQ|4.0|Me compr este lbum despus de empezar a interesarme por la carrera de  Madonna y descubrir leyendo crticas y pginas web  la verdadera devocin  que la gente guarda en general hacia Like A pRAYER. Yo ya conoca algo del  material porque tena The Inmaculate Colection como versiones diferentes de  Like a Prayer, Express Yourself y Cheris. La cancin Like A Prayer me  encantaba pero tena entendido que la versin del lbum era 1000 veces  mejor que la del grandes xitos (de un aire ms discotequero). so quiz me  llevo a comprar el disco finalmente. Express Yourself tambin me gustaba  pero tambin descubr que la versin original es mucho mejor. Cheris no me  haca mucha gracia y me pareca cursi. Despus de oirla en el disco sigue  sin emocionarme pero una vez ms la primera versin es la mejor. El disco  en general me parece muy bueno, muco ms maduro que otros trabajos de  Madonna en los 80,  aunque me parece que algunos sonidos son a veces un  poco pueriles y desfasados. Trata muchos temas: el amor, las relaciones  sentimentales, la familia (en varios temas), las peleas callejeras..... El  tema de Prince es bastante bueno y creativo, no entiendo porque la gente  detesta esta cancin. Promise to try es una muy bonita balada bastante bien  interpretada. Oh Father al principio no me entusiasmaba y ya la conoca  desde Something To Remember y ahora me gusta bastante....Spanish Eyes es  pegadiza y me gusta pero siendo espaol no me identifico con el estilo  musical: creo que tiene el estilo que los estado unidenses creen que los  espaoles tenemos y no es as....Me gusta Act Of Contricction porque  despus de toda la seriedad del lbum y del rollo religioso, etc...Madonna  le quita hierro con este chiste. Su voz suena bastante mejor que en otros  trabajos de esa poca pero no canta como en Ray Of Light o Evita: En  resumen, es un disco bastante bueno, artstico y creativo dentro del pop,  pero no es la perfeccin musical: Su obra maestra es para m Ray Of Light.
B00004RFFM|3.0|fast forward through the first half hour.i fell asleep through that.but it got really,really better.see this if you liked jaws, or lake placid
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Yup.  Rage Against The Machine won't compromise that's for sure.  There's no way this band will ever &quot;sell out&quot; (although I've never really seen a band sell out in my opinion).  They're a really hands-on band, they  do all their own instruments, no sequencers, no computer sound effects, and  they don't forget the fans.  Their hardcore leftist doctrine is a little  heavy handed, but accurate.  This is the kind of music that makes you want  to start screaming the lyrics outside of the Capitol Building.  Thanks for  listening to my rantings.
B000002OVJ|5.0|Live At Leeds is the best example of the Who live. All the songs are great and sound really good. The best song on the album is Magic Bus. A necesity for any fan of the Who.
B00000K19E|1.0|This was a horrible movie.  It wasn't exciting until the last 30 minutes and even then I didn't jump off my seat.  Most of the things I didn't even get.  Making a trilogy out of the Matrix is a horrible idea.
B000002UA0|4.0|Piper is a great album. Pink Floyd, however have so many other great albums that are better. I personally like the Roger Waters Pink Floyd. But this stuff is still great. The best songs are Lucifer Sam, Take Up Thy  Stethoscope and Walk, and Interstellar Overdrive. Although not Floyd's  best, it is still essential to any fan.
B000001E7L|5.0|This is the first Cranberries CD I bought, and now I own all of them.  Like a lot of people, I bought the CD for the song &quot;Zombie&quot;.  I was younger then, and though the song is a great one, as I've matured I've  found the rest of the CD to be more inspiring as a whole than as a single  song on its own.  The title track and &quot;Empty&quot; figure among my  favorites now.  I definitely recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of  Irish music, or alternative, or anyone who is just looking for a good  listen.  You can't find much to compare to Delores' incredible voice.
B000002G85|5.0|Eric Clapton's debut album as a solo artist is one of his best albums ever. It has the hits that are great, such as After Midnight, Blues Power, and Let It Rain. It also great lesser known songs, no fillers. Some of  these are Bad Boy, Lonesome and a Long Way From Home, and Lovin' You Lovin'  Me. All the songs are great. This album is what Clapton is all about. Buy  It.
B00000J7J4|5.0|this album is great. so much effort and talent went in to this production,and it shows. it is the best santana yet. clear and complex, buy it and leave it in the player.
B000002KOG|3.0|Neil Young's debut album falls short of most of his albums to come. However, it does give you a fair idea that Young had alot of good things ahead. And of course he did. I would recommend Neil Young as essential  listening to any fan.
B000001Y42|5.0|I just got this cd on the 21 of April and I love it. In my specifications this is much better than Significan Other. Its more metal and just better. I'm a big Bizkit fan and this is by far one of the best cds I have ever baught. If you don't already own this then what are you wating for?  ... go get it!
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's gets alot of credit and is called one of the greatest albums of all time. It is. And it isn't even the Beatles best (Rubber Soul.) Every song on the album is great, as usual on a Beatles album. Everyone should  own this album.
0446525537|5.0|This is a story of a teenager who finds himself.  It can be related to anyone who has ever grown up.  It brings a wide range of emotions and tells how the power of prayer can heal all.  A faith in God is a wonderful healer  and He guides us in His chosen path for each of us.  This book brings out  how the unexpected can turn into something wonderful.  The book made me  laugh, it made me ponder, cry and rejoice.  It is a touching book and makes  you realize that love can be found by all in all sorts of ways...
B0000024ZT|5.0|Greetings From Asbury Park is a very strong debut album. It isn't as good as Wild and Born To Run, but few albums are. Blinded By The Light, Growin' Up, and Spirit in The Night are the best songs on the album, but all are  great. Essential to any fan of The Boss.
6305127638|5.0|Frakes's directing is impeccable. The actors's acting is beautiful. The special effects are mindblowing. The storyline is awesome. It's all full of humor and action.  I really love these quotes &quot;Assimiliate this&quot;,  &quot;You are astronauts on a star trek&quot;, &quot;For an android, it is  an eternity&quot; and &quot;resistance is futile&quot; Also, the movie  delves into Cochrane's history. I never liked Cochrane in TOS episode  &quot;Metamorphosis but after watching this movie, I made him my favorite  Star Trek character. Borg queen seducing Data is sensational. <br />There are  no flaws i can find in this movie except lots of inaccuracies such as if  the Borg can survive in outer space, then why do the Borg waste energy  producing oxyegen atmospheres in borg cubes for it is irrelevant (You'll  check it in TNG episodes); Borg shouldn't be stopped by lack of access to  computer; and by the time Enterprise-E reaches Earth from Romulan space,  the Borg has already assimiliated Earth but who cares about these  inaccuracies as long as the movie is still great?
B000002KIE|4.0|Never Mind The Bollocks is overrated, in my opinion. It is not one of the greatest albums of all time. It isn't even my favorite punk album. However, it is still very good. Songs like Anarchy in The UK, God Save The Queen,  and Pretty Vacant are punk classics and essential to any punk fan. Although  this album isn't the best, it is still good, and very essential and every  punk fan should own a copy. If you don't, I don't think you are a true fan  of punk. But that's just my opinion.
630242335X|5.0|The plot is captivating. The script is great. The special effects are awesome. It became my favorite ST movie. <br />I loved the idea of introducing Klingon enthusiasm for Shakespeare into this movie.  Christopher Plummer  makes a great villain. In my opinion, Chang is the greatest ST villains.  Chang being a bald, eyepatched, Machiavellian, Shakespearean Klingon  general is not only great but also unique.
B000002KAT|5.0|Astral Weeks is Truly an incredible album. Either this album or Moondance is his best. Every song on this album is beautiful. Especially Sweet Thing and Slim Slow Rider. Buy this album. You won't be disapointed
0743200799|4.0|Most of the books written about the early days of the space race and the dramatic race to the moon focus on the astronauts and their feelings upon being part of the program, with their autobiographies, and biographies written by Apollo historians, such as Andrew Chaikin's &quot;Man on the  Moon.  However, this book by flight director Gene Kranz offers a new  perspective on the missions, as he explains how the dramatic events in the  void of space were handeled by mission control in Houston-Alan Shepard's  Freedom 7 flight, John Glenn's Friendship 7 flight, the first lunar orbit  on Apollo 8, the first lunar landing on Apollo 11, and the &quot;successful  failure&quot; of Apollo 13.  The story of these missions have been told  many times, yes, but not in the eyes of a man in mission control.  The book  is not high literature, as the sentences are short and choppy, but that is  not likely to concern a space buff reading this book.  Overall, this book  is a unique and new perspective on the early days of the space program.
B000001IQH|5.0|Rancid's And Out Come The Wolves is the best punk album since London Calling. I Highly recommend this album to any punk fan.
6305750750|4.0|This widescreen version of Star Wars episode 1 is not too bad,considering there was no DVD release at the time of its release. My beefs are that is is available only in this extra cost version. ... (The ONLY way to see a star Wars movie on TV) The film strip,book,and feautrette is not bad,but I would have preffered a WS Movie eonly tape piced the same as the pan/scan. Thankfully there is a DVD,but it's still important to have a widescreen VHS tape.
B000002UA2|3.0|This cd is worth getting strictly for &quot;Free Four&quot; but the rest is average at best. There is a reason Floyd did not include this in their box set. I am a huge fan of Floyd, but this cd is just not up to their  usual standards considering it is sandwiched between Meddle &amp; Dark Side  Of The Moon.
B00000K19E|3.0|Ok it had good effects but in a couple of years they will be obsolete the scene when the helicopter crashes with the building if it happened for real if wouldn't look like a circle of water so that was not well done and also the scene when the lobby is full of fire that fire looks like water I must  admit that it did had some great action scenes but a soso script and keanu  reeves can't act but the agent and Mr. Fishburne saved the movie still  blade runner is better
B000002OX7|4.0|Arguably one of the best Rock albums of the seventies - if not all time - &quot;Who's Next&quot; is  essential to own for every self-respecting music fan.  In its original 9 song form the album is without a flaw, taking the  listener from the synthesized prog-rock leanings of opener &quot;Baba O'  Riley&quot; to a seasoned rocker such as the closing classic &quot;Won't  Get Fooled Again&quot; - all neatly stitched together with what probably  was Keith Moon's overall best recorded performance.  And, as a result, the  band as a whole rises to the occasion and was never before nor has ever  since been quite this good.  All the while, versatility is definitely the  word here.  &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;, simply put, must be one of the  very best songs of its kind ever written; a pop ballad which never gets  whimsy or over sentimental.  Similarily, &quot;The Song Is Over&quot; and  &quot;Getting in Tune&quot; deliver the goods and quite a bit more, with  only &quot;Pure And Easy&quot;, initially so oddly omitted from what  would've been an unrivaled trilogy of pure-pop excellence.  That oversight,  however, is corrected here by adding the original version  of  &quot;P&amp;E&quot; as one of the extra tracks on this excellently  remastered version of the album.  That said, not all of the other extras   quite live up to the high standard of so much of the other material on the  disc, and hence my mere 4 star verdict.  A cover of Marvin Gaye's  &quot;Baby Don't You Do It&quot; was never one of his better moments and,  unsurprisingly, doesn't even equal The Who's other early Motown covers a la  &quot;Heatwave&quot;, inspite of Moon's always thunderous performance.   &quot;Water&quot; is just an overglorified B-side if you ask me, and  although &quot;Naked Eye&quot; fares slightly better, an unnecessary  almost-same-as-the-original extra version of &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;  is, well, unnecessary.  &quot;Too Much Of Anything&quot; and &quot;I Don't  Even Know Myself&quot; are a delight, though, and absolutely - along with  the aforementioned &quot;Pure And Easy&quot; - justify the addition of  these bonus tracks although a slightly more selective caution could have  been shown.  Still, 12-13 great tracks out of 16 ain't a bad buy - far from  it.  Yes, as someone said here earlier, this indeed is 'Who's best'...and  darn it, that was going to be MY review summation!
0790729628|5.0|I don't know what was so great about The Matrix in a couple of years it would be forgotten but Blade Runner will still be among the best I wonder how the special effects used on the movie haven't been used again I think that someone from the future came with a time machine and brought this  movie which he made in a little room and travelled back in time to the year  1982. This is probably the best sci-fi movie ever great story, great  acting, great effects, so that gives us that this movie is simply great I  think of it better than Star Wars they should make the sequel and they  should re-release it in theatres I'm sure it would make a couple of  millions maybe people will finally understand it and maybe it could gross  more than Titanic and Star Wars together because wow this movie is THE  MOVIE!
B00003A9QI|5.0|To describe this CD-<br />A quiet walk in a lush meadow or pasture on a clear,golden afternoon with a gentle breeze lulling-on Autumn.
B00000G3PA|4.0|This is a good action movie yes a little dumb but has great effects, great action scenes don't think only enjoy this is a fun movie that was made for the general public. For one of the reviews down maybe they needed the  gattling gun for protection against any aliens or something.
630575067X|4.0|For those who thought this will be the worst episode of Star Wars, don't be so cynical. Although there is hardly any fighting and the characters are a little plain...ITS ONLY THE FIRST EPISODE! Why didn't Qui Gon Jin  disappear? What will happen between the senators of Malistar(?), Alderan  and Naboo? What happens to Anakins mum? Why is Yoda so important and wise?  What happened to the orginal Sith Lords? <br />Remember, THINGS ARE ONLY GOING  TO GET BETTER!
B00000JCB2|4.0|This album is very good to listenning!  I will got it for my birthday!  I give to this 4 stars. Buy it and I never listen a disc too better of Limp Bizkit, The significant other
0792151712|4.0|This has to go down in history as the biggest movie of last millenium.  At the time of its release, and even to this day, it was the most expensive, biggest grossing movie of all time.  On top of that, it tied the record for  most academy award wins.  Now this should guarantee that EVERYBODY should  have been blown away by it.  And I must admit that I enjoyed the normally  barf-worthy romance of the story, even though there were some idiotic  scenes (the spitting? ).  Of course, the romance isn't REALLY what the  movie is about.  It was just meant to develop a classically tragic  storyline, just showing how impactful the event really was.  Without the  first half, the second half could not have worked, because without it, the  audience wouldn't care about a sinking boat.  The visual effects are eye  popping, and the direction is magnificent.  At 194 minutes long, you'd  think it runs way too long - it doesn't.  When all is said and done, it's a  great way to kill three hours of time.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll  hurl, you'll forget about it in three months.
1570427496|5.0|DUED....THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD BOOK. I NORMALYY DONT LIKE TO READ BUT THIS BOOK WAS SUCH A HEART-WARMING STORY. I READ THIS IN TWO NIGHTS,  HE MADE THE BOOK A GOOD BOOK FROM THE START  AND I THINK IT IS THE WAY HE WROTE THE BOOK THAT  MADE NOT WANT TO PUT THE BOOK DOWN, IT JUST GOT BETTER AND  BETTER AND IT FELT LIKE THE THINGS THAT WERE GOING ON REALLY WERE IT WAS SO  REAL. TALK ABOUT AN AWESOME BOOK. I AM SO GLAD I READ IT.DUED I WOULD SAY  READ IT.

B00000JPH5|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen.  It shows the limits we use our imagination and how much we can learn.  I would watch this movie over and over again.

B000002KYK|5.0|For quite a while we have looked for this album.  Compared to the 1994 re-release of the soundtrack this album is wonderful!  I have loved this music since I was 3 sitting in the car with my mom.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This CD will touch your soul.  Moby will inspire you, move you, sadden  you, take you to utopia.  Listen to sample #4, you'll see what I mean.
6300181456|5.0|The only thing wrong with this somewhat &quot;unique&quot; cinematic masterpiece is that it has not received the critical appreciation and acclaim it deserves. Flawless casting, a swinging soundtrack and dazzling  dance routines combine to make this a truly unforgettable experience which  will change your humdrum  existence into something undeniably magical and  musical.
6304030959|5.0|This is a film I enjoyed even though it made me recall some of the conflicts I had with MY father as I was growing up.  I feel this is a good movie for saturday nights; a bit scarry but lots of fun.  I'm not sure young kids would trust their board games again, but aside from that, I  think it is fun for the whole family.  Williams and the others of the cast  are excellent and don't over play their roles.  I certainly enjoyed it in  the theater and continue to enjoy it as a video.
0446525537|1.0|After reading both Message in a Bottle and The Notebook, and loving them both, I couldn't wait for Nicholas Sparks' next book.  This one seemed to be written by a seventh-grader in its content and characters.  It was too predictable and goody-goody to keep me interested.  Although I always read  a book in its entirety, even if I don't like it, this was one book I would  have put down after a couple of chapters, but since I bought it I needed to  try to get my money's worth.  After reading two-thirds of the book,  something finally happened but not anything substantial.  All the clues  that something will happen, what a tease! Try again, Nicholas, and don't  rush the next one.
6300214435|2.0|After Raiders... I found this episode dark and sinister with little to redeem it.  The actors struck me as very one dimensional and not all that entertaining, even Ford.  The special effects were well done as one would  expect from a film of this type.  I do not find myself wanting to run out  and see this again on video, unlike the other Indiana Jones films.  I'm not  sure what Mr. Lucas was aiming for with this film but he missed me.
B00003CWRX|5.0|60 Minutes' famous journalistic lense is turned back on itself in one of the most exciting dramatic films of 1999.  Aside from the great performances by nearly all concerned, the story is - from start to finish -  riveting.  <br />At its core, it's the battle of one ordinary man's battle  between losing everything he holds dear, family and reputation, and what he  knows to be the right thing - exposing the tobacco industry's efforts to  chemically engineer cigarettes to be more addictive.  Along the way, watch  as 60 Minutes exec. producer Don Hewitt is seen caving to corporate  pressure to cut the story to shreds because the corporate division is  concerned the segment may lead to a lawsuit that will jeopardize an  unannounced sale of the network to Westinghouse and the resulting big  bonuses and salaries to corporate executives and a sleazy lawyer (is there  any other kind?) delisciously played by Gina Gershon. <br />Russell Crowe, Al  Pacino and Christopher Plummer hold nothing back in their performances.   For anyone who's ever been curious about how a news organization works (or  stumbles occasionally), this film provides the insight.  The DVD is a  wonderful transfer, also.
0060920084|2.0|After spending most of my life seeing the rest of the world, I just completed a spectacular 11-month drive on the two-lane roads of America.  Although I agree there are plenty of warts, such as fast-food restaurants  in embarrassing numbers, I chalked those up to &quot;progress&quot; in a  country that is otherwise truly magnificent, and I'll never stop being  grateful that it's mine.  Am just glad I didn't depend on Bryson's opinion  before the trip, or I'd never have realized the dream of a lifetime!  His  writing style is clever and witty - too bad America-bashing is how he  employs it.
0688062334|5.0|THis is one of my favorite books!  This is one of Dianna Wynne Jones' best.  I mean it.  The characters are hilariously funny.  I love Sophie and Howl.  Howl's tantrums, and the way he is so not like an ordinary wizard.  Sophie is definitely not a failure.  She is great! Calcifer is loveable.   With his blue hair, and Howl's coal lump of a heart.  This book was just  amazing.  I've read it four times, and the characters and plot never bore  me!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I can trulely say this is the best cd I've ever listened to. I thought the first album was good but then she came and blew me away with the second. Fiona has such a georgous voice and she puts so much emotion and spirt into  her songs that its just.....breathetaking
B00000I0XW|1.0|i did not enjoy this collection of andrew lloyd weber songs.  frankly i do not enjoy sarah brightman at all and her voice lacks training and clarity.  buy a cd with a person with talent.
B000003TA4|4.0|nirvana is one of the best bands.this album has almost all of their best songs and the other songs are good to.this is for every true rock, and a must  have for every nirvana fan
B00001QEE7|5.0|I loved this movie when I was nine and it first came out, and I love it now even though I'm almost twenty.  The animation is beautiful, such as the opening tour of the sea to the lilting tune of &quot;Fathoms Below&quot;  and the tour of the kingdom, and the score is undisputably wonderful and  memorable.  There are some classic movie moments here; seeing the waves  crash up around Ariel as she sings the reprise of &quot;Part of Your  World&quot; still gives me chills up and down my spine, and &quot;Under the  Sea&quot; and &quot;Kiss the Girl&quot; are great scenes too.  Some people  have expressed concern about the supposedly sexist plot.  I suppose if you  insist on looking at every male/female role in the movie as a symbol then  you could complain about this, but in my opinion these characters have  enough personality to rise above standing as simple symbols, so there isn't  anything to worry about. (The same is not true, I think for Pocohontas --  in that movie the political correctness was so stifling that the characters  were boring and you were never really allowed to feel any emotions about  them.)  Anyways, like I said, the score is great, and if you buy the movie  you may as well buy the CD as well because you're going to want to sing the  songs even when you're away from the TV.  This is the first of the brief  but great period of collaboration between Howard Ashman and Alan Menken.   Together they also did &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;,  &quot;Aladdin&quot;, and &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; which all come  highly recommended.  They deserve most of the credit for Disney's animation  renaissance of the early '90s, which, I think is unfortunately long over by  now.  (The pop-modernistic music of &quot;Tarzan&quot; does not appeal to  me in the least, and I think it will quickly become outdated, unlike this  timeless score.)  In conclusion, GET this movie -- it's worth your money.
B000002H2H|4.0|Ride the Lighting is the second best album of Metallica's career, and musically it is leaps and bounds over Kill 'Em All.  The most well-written song has to be Fade to Black, which was their first of many &quot;acoutic  to effortless overdrive&quot; epics. All in all, Lightning is a classic,  but again, is not the best Metallica album ever - though it's damn close.
B00000K19E|4.0|This film blew my mind. My first impression was an overly-hyped special-effects ridden, money-driven movie. What I got was an awesome tour-de-force of special effects action and one of the most engaging fighting sequences of all time. The writing is not the greatest, I agree,  but it seems fitting at times for the film. I also thought that Lawrence  Fishburne as Morpheus was a perfect cast (and they were going to cast Val  Kilmer.) Carrie Ann Moss was awesome in her role along with whoever the  actor was who played the head Agent. Overly-violent at times it still has  some scenes that will stick with you for a long-time. The Matrix is one of  those movies that'll have you questioning your reality at film's end. The  Matrix is a gripping thriller with awe-inspiring special effects that is  sure to become a cult classic and will be enjoyed for years to come.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best heavy metal album ever released by any band.  Every song is intelligently written with lyrics that fit the songs perfectly.  Even on &quot;Orion,&quot; one of the greatest instrumental rock songs ever, the harmonized guitars seem to have  a voice - a harmony that very few bands have ever been able to accomplish.   Nearly every song is around 7 or 8 minutes long, but it never becomes  boring or uninteresting.  What sets this album apart from other Metallica  albums and other great albums is that it has an epic, special sound.  Only  one word can describe the perfectly structured compositions and well  thought out lyrics : Perfect.
B000002UVZ|5.0|This is the best album in REM's pre-Out-of-Time era.  The guitar riffs, driving rhythms and distinquishable lyrics are energized with an indie flare and anti-80's pop muster.  However, to celebrate LRP as only a party  album denies its graceful pleasures.  While the cracking-whip-force of  &quot;Begin the Begin&quot; and &quot;These Days&quot; establishes the mood  of the album, it's tracks three and four that start bringing in the reigns.   By the time &quot;The Flowers of Guatemala&quot; begins, you've relaxed  into the quiet gleeful state the album tends to elicit.  But &quot;I  Believe&quot; should sublty ignite the REM fan.  It indeed is the climax of  the album.  And it's also classical REM: introverted, vigilant optimism,  i.e. Stipe's trademark mirthy malaise.  By the time the album ends with  &quot;Superman&quot;, you'll be ready for track one again.  If you like pop  music with a mind, order this album today!
B000002H6C|4.0|This album has the most over-complicated song structures and anti-political lyrics I have ever heard.  The songs are all extremely fast, and the pace never lets up - if it weren't for this fact, the album would  become boring.  There is some great material on this album (One,  Blackened), but  the production values are terrible.  The guitars sound  like a flock of bees humming along and I would swear that Lars only used  kettle drums.  The great songs are over-shadowed by this - a huge  disappointment.  After this release, Metallica became a less angry band and  slowed things down a lot; this was Metallica's last thrash hurrah, making  it worth having.  Not their best, but it's in their top 3.
B000002UAX|3.0|I was there when this came out - I believe almost to the day another band named the Rolling Stones released an album called Beggars Banquet, which cut this one to pieces then and now, when judged in its entirety. Let's get rational about this stuff; some of it is quite catchy; some of it is  unlistentable (do people wake up thinking &quot;I have to hear 'why don't  we do it in the road' before I have breakfast&quot;?  The Beatles made some pretty good music  on this album, but they made better elsewhere. It had its rabid fans back  then, and, reading some of the reviews below, they seem to be still around,  rationalizing the garbage half (or so) of this record that should never  have been released. Rather than reflecting the group's trying to  &quot;expand their range&quot; by experimenting with all different kinds of  styles, it was more a harbringer of the coming bloat of double albums by  other sixties/early seventies commercially successful bands, released with  the idea that &quot;if we create it, it must be good&quot;. I don't expect  many complimentary comments on this review from the Beatles fanatics, but  for you younger folks who have not been immersed in this stuff for thirty  years, believe me, there are wheel barrows of 60s albums that should go to  the desert island with you before this one. If you must take a Beatles  album with you, I'd suggest Sgt. Pepper's.
0451160916|5.0|...This book blows that way out of the water!  This book ROCKED!  It was extremely slow for the first 3 chapters (which I have tried to read about 10 times since I first got this book two years ago), so I skipped them and  went for chapter 4.  I started this on April 19th, somewhere in the middle  of the day, and I finished it on the night of April 21st.  The suspense was  killing me!  For being Stephen King's third full-length book ever written,  I have to say that this was more fast and furious than his later ones or  his Richard Bachman novels.  Some novels tend to take a long, long time to  introduce each character, so when the strange events and phenomena begin,  we can more easily notice the changes in them.  This book takes a while to  introduce them, but it has the strange phenomena running parallel to this  so we see clearly that strange things are happening, and at the same time,  we get to know more about the characters.  And what introductions to the  characters, as well: Wendy, cracking up over how the Overlook Hotel is  eating away at the family's sanity as well as their relationships and  friendships; Jack, an ex-alcoholic, now deeply feeling the need to hit the  bottle again as he falls apart from the strange occurences in the Overlook;  Danny, who has this strange power, is slowly cracking up over the strange  phenomena that is communicating through him and to him; and finally, the  Overlook itself... Well, I guess I should not give away too much about  this.  Instead of writing all this, I could have summed it up with these 11  words: scary, suspensful, action-packed, surprising, haunting, spooky, and  well-introduced.  Oh, well.  In even simpler terms, I say, read it.   ...redrum...  ...Redrum... ...REDRUM... ...REDRUM-REDRUM...  ...REDRUMREDRUMREDRUMREDRUM!
630575067X|3.0|I would have to say that this is not Lucas's best film ever produced. The voice overs in the movie are very cheesy, sounds like something from a 50's film. Overall visual special effects are great as always. The plot line  seems a bit hard to grasp at first, but overall easy to understand. Jar Jar  binks as im sure you might have heard is a bit annoying, but does however  add a little humor to the movie, definitely a chick charactor (no offense).  <br />I am definitely looking forward to Episode II and I hope Lucas puts a  bit more of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; feeling back into it.
1560689986|4.0|&quot;The Life of Brian&quot; is one of the most brillant comedies ever created (I would list &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; a close second).  The Pythons' best work by far.  While the movie presents clever satire of religious fanaticism, it much stronger in satirizing political fanaticism  and hypocrisy: and the two themes never meet in this movie. The People's  Front of Judea wants Brian because he hates the Romans &quot;a lot,&quot;  NOT because they believe he is the Messiah.  Still they are the ones who  show up at the crucifixion.  The parallel plot strains stress the often  random nature of life events.  In the end, it's the political satire that  puts this movie ahead of its peers.  To understand the genius of the  political satire, I suggest that you join an underground political  movement, and then watch the movie again with fresh eyes.
B000002N9L|4.0|I don't care if this is supposed to be a bunch of &quot;throwaways&quot;. I don't care if some don't dig it. All I know is this album rocks with a vengeance, and proves that even a bunch of supposed &quot;throwaways&quot;  from Prince are better than most other &quot;artists&quot; finished  product! The title cut, I Like It There, Zannalee, and I Rock Therefore I  Am are all faves, but the overall quality is consistent.  If you like  Prince, really like Prince, and know where he's coming from  musically/stylistically, U won't be disappointed with this rekkid.
B00002DEIX|3.0|One of the great strengths of Joshua Redman is his insatiable appetite for seeking new directions. For a player with such a short career his albums show a remarkable diversity and originality, something that is due in large  part to Redman's skills as a composer. On Beyond Redman once takes a new  route, consisting of original compositions only. The album has a kind of  inward looking, pensive mood. But whilst his other albums succeeded in  presenting a clear direction and concept, on this one the band seems to  struggle with the material that seems to be too stubborn to get things  going. The tunes and the solos lack the supreme combination of  sophistication and soul that Redman is so famous for. Redman and his band  are of course playing too solid to disappoint any serious jazz fan, but  those that really want to get to know this brilliant saxophonist should  start with Wish, Live at the Village Vanguard or Freedom in the Groove. Or  wait a while:  his urge in developing himself will definitely bring us an  album that will match his earlier work.
B00003CX6P|4.0|I recommend The Talented Mr. Ripley to those Matt Damon fans all over the world. Matt does a wonderful job as Mr. Ripley making him as evil and mischevious as he was in the novel. Matt bring Mr. Ripley to life as soon as the first brudal muder is commited. This movie is definatly one of the  best thrillers ever. The story is great, but gets a little confusing at  times. Pay attention and keep focus, and you will enjoy it as much as I  did.
B000002KON|5.0|I've struggled long and hard to decide which Kinks album would qualify as my favorite. There are quite a few to choose from. There's the lovely quietude of 'Village Green' and 'Something Else' and there's the  strangeness of 'Percy,' the transition of 'Face to Face' and the last good  gasp of 'Lola'<br />But Arthur crushes them all in its giant maw...<br />From the  first song, where you hear Dave whooping with joy in the background to the  last defeated rave-up, this album is pure greatness and it should be  requisite law that every house should have it. <br />What makes this album  their best, other than it being a concept album (and we all know that  concept albums make the best albums), is that it is a album of 20 songs,  most of them songs within songs. It's rare for an album to cover so much  terrain and still come in under an hour. <br />Besides which, this is the  Kinks at their shining hour of greatness, all their successes and defeats  behind them and nothing as good as this in their future. Ray's writing is  more genius than its ever been before. The Kinks' playing has never been so  tight and together. <br />Plus it has 'Shangri-La.' Which is possibly one of  the 10 best songs ever written...<br />So share with the Kinks the joy of  conquering the muscial frontier and weld your CD player shut as soon as you  put &quot;Arthur&quot; in it....
6305627401|5.0|South Park Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is more a musical then a comedy. The songs are awesome and are definitly some of the funniest songs and phrases ever. Eric Cartman will make you practicly pee your pants when the movie is over. Kenny McKormic will do his usual act, that is die, but this movie he  dies over and over again. Stan and Kyle help out with a few crude, but  hilarious jokes along the way. Then their is Sadam and Satan; which is one  of the funniest parts in the movie. Then their is the zapper. Whenever  Cartman uses a bad word he gets electrocuted by a shock wave. This movie  rocks!
B00003CWRX|5.0|This is a great movie starring russell crowe and al pacino. It was well worthy of it's oscar nomination for best picture. The movie builds with tension as the it moves along. The DVD has some great features and great  picture quality. The movie is over 2 hours but as with any great film time  is not an issue. This is well worth the money to buy.
055321263X|5.0|Having read the novel several times, I now return to it mostly to reread Mr. Fairlie's account of the events he witnessed. It's an invariably uplifting experience. His common sense and beautiful hypochondria dwarf  even Count Fosco, the arch villain of the novel. For those who haven't yet  read the book, its intricate plot and other colorful personages no doubt  will also be of interest. A true masterpiece.
B00003CWN2|5.0|This film was stunning, sad, beautiful, inspirational. HilarySwank plays Brandon Teena, or Teena Brandon. She is woman with asexual identity crisis. When she is uncovered as a girl, her white trash friends decide to teach her a little lesson. I watched this film and at the end I was bawling my eyes out. The film was so sad, touching and poignat, that I couldn't stand it. I don't know why it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture because it could have won. Hilary Swank one Best Actress and she DEFINITLY deserved it. She was so excellent that I thought she deserved the Oscar from the first 5 minutes. Chloe Sevigny plays Lana, the woman who Brandon befriends and falls in love with. Sevigny was excellent in her role as second heroine. The acting in the film is nothing short of spectacular.  This film touched me so much! I'm not afraid to admit that I DID cry. I couldn't believe that such a wonderful film could be made. And I didn't believe that these events actually took plave only 7 years ago.
B00003W8NO|5.0|This movie is the best movie in the world! the animation is perfect, the characters are hysterical, and the plot is superb! if you don't have this movie i am wondering why not because you have to get it. it is perfect for old people, little kids, and teenagers like me. go buy toy story today!
630512762X|5.0|I have always liked the movies of John Woo (Hard Target, Broken Arrow) because of the good shot action scenes and the beautifull and spectaculair slow-motion action scenes.  Face/Off has that too, and even much better!   This movie has the most spectaculair scenes I have ever seen! Plus the  fabulous performances of john Travolta and Nicolas Cage, the very good  score of John Powell and a very original story. <br />All that makes this one  of the best action movies ever made that everyone who likes a good story  and a lot of great action, or just a good movie, should see.
B000002B30|4.0|I'm not a huge Springsteen fan, but I do like his music, so I decided to purchase this one CD with a lot of his greatest songs on it. I wasn't disappointed. Some of the best songs on there include &quot;Born to  Run&quot;, &quot;Glory Days&quot;, &quot;Murder Incorporated&quot;,  &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;, and  &quot;Badlands&quot;, but there really isn't any terrible songs. If you're  a big Springsteen fan, this CD may not satisfy your wants, but if you maybe  just enjoy listening to him from time to time or are a beginner as a fan of  his, this CD is a worthy buy. Also, within the cover of the CD, Bruce  himself gives a little background story and opinion on each song, fun to  read.
068484267X|5.0|Absorbing and engrossing pretty much the whole way through, Frank McCourt's much-lauded memoir of his miserable Irish childhood is just as good, whether being humorous or sad, as everyone says.  Yes, it moves very well between laughter and tears, between giggle-worthy childhood exploits  and other more sobering experiences, and hardly ever fails to lose the  reader's interest.  It is easy to visualize his relatives and friends, even  if the descriptions of them are kind of sparse.  It is pretty amazing that  he can remember so clearly events that happened when he was three onward.   (The cynics would say he made some up, but I'm not really a cynic)  Both  moving and funny, endearing and not really forgettable.
039472903X|5.0|This book brings science to advertising.  How many words should you use?  Where should pictures be placed due to eye movement?  Should pictures have captions.  Lots, on the top and yes are Ogilvy's answers.  Great book.
067088278X|5.0|I decided that I would look up my favourite childhood book today. I didn't know if they had it in amazon I was so surprized when I found it and the cover brought back so many memories I almost cried.  I am 18 years old and  whenever I go to the library I look for this book  ( I still sign it out)I  really recommend this book to anyone, adults and children. I absolutly had  to give the book five stars!
6303073107|5.0|The description provided above says so much.  But, in today's world with the emphasis on business, interpersonal relationships and differences in opinion, PERCEPTION is everything. Four people tell about the same event in  different ways. Each way is convincing. One begins to say &quot;that's what  happened&quot; and then the circle opens.  This can be watched in a group  or at a party and great discussion will result, maybe with some Saki to  mellow the differences. <br />There is an actor who walks into the scene at  the beginning, wanders around and seems to set the stage for the four  stories.  After they are told, the pouring rain, which has kept the  listeners around stops.  The actor picks up life in a way that offers  redemption for all.  One can focus on the opening or closing and build a  story.<br />This is great for movie buffs, those starting with their first  subtitled movie and also anyone concerned with interpersonal relationships.  Marketers would especially gain from this.<br />The challenge is to get a  vision that all can agree on. Rashomon does not achieve this goal yet all  can agree something happened. What? The question is part of the  universality and greatness of Rashomon.  Buy it and guard it. agree  take  all.
0792151712|1.0|WHEN DEALING WITH A MOVIE LIKE THIS, YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC.  I MEAN, COME ON, YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT ROSE LOOKED SEVENTEEN?  YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE JACK WAS THE HERO?

AND  DO YOU HONESTLY THINK A SEVENTEEN (SUPPOSEDLY) YEAR OLD GIRL WOULD WANT TO  COMMIT SUICIDE AFTER HAVING ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD?  NO WAY!  THIS FILM  WAS JUST TOOOO UNREALISTIC.  IT DIDN'T CUT IT!  THIS IS A FILM WITH MANY,  MANY FLAWS WHICH UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE EVEN CLOSELY CONSIDERED  TO BE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!  I MEAN, THE DISASTROUS SINKING OF A SHIP  THAT KILLED OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH A CHEAP AND FAKE  LOVE STORY. <br />*AND DON'T THINK I DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE, CAUSE I DO.  I  JUST DON'T BELIEVE IN A LOVE THAT NEVER WAS.    <br />=)
0783241569|4.0|I thought this video was very good. Set in a typical, British atmosphere, this video details the life of a world-famous actress and a book-salesman. A very interesting video with my favourite character being Spike. He's  weird and funny. Quite a good content and It's altogether an Average sortof  video.
B000034CCH|5.0|There is not a dull note or wasted beat on this masterpiece from 1966. This is a direct replication of the original album. It swings from the first track AQUARIAN MOON and never lets up climaxing in one of my all-time  favourite tracks THE OMEN, which is a nod towards free music. Six out of  seven tracks are by the leader, and major jazz master Mr Hutcherson, and  one by the renowned Mr Hancock - MAIDEN VOYAGE which rivals its twin on the  album of the same name, one of the most famous single tracks in all modern  jazz. Along with this track, there is a waltz BOUQUET with an amazing solo  by Mr Hutcherson, a Spanish flavoured number, ROJO, a ballad WHEN YOU ARE  NEAR, which provide a beautifully balanced programme of music. After many,  many listenings over 30 years I am still touched by the feeling and  inventiveness of this beautiful music. Compare it to THROB to see how  lightweight THROB is (Mr Jarrett and Mr Burton). I believe BOUQUET and THE  OMEN can sit quite comfortably alongside other masterpieces in the music,  such as John Lewis' DJANGO, or Mr Hubbard's RED CLAY. It's one of my  &quot;can't live without this music&quot; discs. It's also got one of the  sexiest and best designed covers ever by Reid Miles.
B00003CXAY|5.0|I first saw this movie in Political Science class in college.  The title of the class was &quot;Human Ecology and Global Transformation.&quot;  We discussed higher level societal issues and read some books by Starhawk,  Saul D. Alinsky, and others.  The class where the professor showed the  movie was the only one we were required to attend to pass the class.  He  started the movie promptly at the start of class, and let it run straight  through without discussion or interruption.  I was a few minutes late (as  always), but was RIVETED.  What an incredible movie.  I've sinced showed it  to most of my friends, in turn, and while they were restless at the start  of the movie, they eventually quieted down, and let the message sink in.   It has been described as a &quot;visual montage&quot;.  A perfect blend of  imagery in music and video together vocalizing a powerful impression.
B000002U82|2.0|If anyone ever told you Dark Side of the Moon was Floyd's best album they indeed were left in the Dark.  DSOTM is not nearly as durable as The Wall.  The Wall both tells a story and presents a theme.  DSOTM is merely a  collection of songs, which receives too much recognition.  With the  exception of Breathe, Time, and Us and Them, DSOTM is anything BUT a  concept album.
057120211X|4.0|When viewing the film, Girl, Interrupted, one of the main thoughts that I found rushing through my conciousness was: &quot;I have to write these words down!&quot; The film is captivating and poetic and full of beautiful  prose about living and loving. The screenplay is equally poetic, but not in  exactly the same manner as the film. Two monologues which can be heard in  the film are not in the book- version and, while this is disappointing at  first, it is interesting to read the writer (James Mangold's) original  thoughts and ideas about this passionate piece.Also a major plus of picking  up the screenplay is the ten pages of director commentary, featuring a very  in- depth interview with Mangold which offers information about the  motivtions behind the dialogue, shooting, acting and casting of the movie.  The storyboards and black and white pictures at the back of the book are  fun additions, but nothing spectacular. Basically, the book is a must for  fans of the film, but don't expect an exact transcript of the movie,  because that's not what this one is!
B0000029AP|5.0|This is, quite possibly, the greatest album ever released. What would rock be today without Sweet Emotion and Walk This Way? Not only those, but the title track, Adam's Apple, and hell, the entire album are absolute masterly  tracks. This is Aerosmith's magnum opus (and that's saying something,  considering that this is the band that gave us Rocks and Pump). Some of Joe  Perry's finest ever guitar work is here, especially on the solos to Walk  This Way and No More No More, and of course Steven Tyler proves that he is  the greatest vocalist in the history of rock music. How could you not like  this album?
1573226521|4.0|Kind of a cool book.  I was well entertained by it.  I liked the Daffy Duck character.  Thought he was kind of a neat piece of magic-realism or something.  There were a lot of good laughs in here, nothing whacky, just real cooool.  I also had a good time reading this because I related to  Richard so well.  I thought and felt almost exactly like him.  I kind of  got to laugh at myself reading this.  This book has a problem though.   Problem: nothing really happens.  At least, nothing happened that would  really interest a non-traveler.  I kept on thinking there was going to be a  big Vietnam-style shoot out climax.  It seemed to be being built up to, but  then it turned out it was just another decent-into-savagery jig.  The  message worked, but it wasn't profound enough for this to be a message  book.  It's cool alright, but by the end, you wonder if  the 300something  pages was really worth it.
B00004SVIK|5.0|Although i agree with the person above that said that would rather want new stuff (i know this is a fan)  But this has hit my heart where it needed to be hit for YEARS.. im only 27 and missed both The Wall and Momentary  Laps of Reson (was sick on that one darnit :( was only what around 6 on the  wall heheh) Finaly i get to hear it live with AWSOME SOUND GUALITY!  (yes  there is buzz in some parts but come on this is from tapes 20 years ago! )   All i can ask for at this time is new music and theater and a DVD so i can  see the wall being built and then torn down with all the members!    Please?  hehehhe
0783241569|3.0|I found the story a little unbelievable, but, nonetheless, entertaining.  Of the performances, I found Hugh Grant's the most noteworthy.
0783235666|4.0|Lowell Peterson is correct about the DVD transfer; the brightness makes the stunning matte work look cheesy. Plus the film is much moodier with a dark print. I guess Universal is afraid people with dim TV sets would think  the print was too dark? <br />However, the sync issue is probably there on the  original print. Much of the dialog was badly looped in post production.  Everything else looked in sync. <br />-dB
B000023VR6|4.0|This is a great comeback album for Dr. Dre, but it isn't as good as the classic Chronic album! But the best songs on here are The Watcher, Still DRE, XXplosive, What's The Difference, and Forgot About Dre! If you liked  the Chronic, you should like this too! Buy it!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is a movie that deserves far more credit than it received at original theatrical release.  It is an addicting story that adds to itself as it goes.  It is a movie about the consequences of coasting through life and the meaning that can be gained through experience.  In this film the  unnamed protagonist gets his only meaning for life through a world that is  special and unique to himself.  As he goes through his life, he meets two  very interesting characters, Tyler and Marla.  These two change and add to  his life in the most profound ways.  The clincher at the end of this film  ties these three together beautifully.  The narrator in this film provides  the absolute paragon of existenialism.  You can feel the chemistry in the  interaction between Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter.   The background score supplied by the Dust Brothers adds the perfect final  touch to this movie experience.  Fight Club is a movie that should be  viewed with an open mind.  It is a wonderful film that will make you think  and reexamine your life.
B00000K19E|4.0|This is one of the best Science Fiction videos I have seen.  The effects are stunning, but not overdone (in most cases).  Perhaps the best effect in the movie is how they managed to mask all of Reeves' poor acting...he  actually is bearable in this film!  The story line is straightforward, and  is blisfully absent of the 42 plot twists that most movies these days seem  to feel are necessary.   The only complaint I have about the movie is the  over-the-top violence.  I am not squeamish by any means, but a couple of  sceenes in the movie left me wondering, 'WHY?'   The DVD has the added  'follow the white rabbit' feature which allows you to see how a certain  effect was done while in the movie.  When you see the white rabbit, click  it, or press ENTER on your remote to see how the effect was  produced...wonderful!
6304056958|5.0|I can't give this film high enough praise - the three things that make a film great to me are character actors, eccentric characters, and good dialogue, and this film has all three.  One of the things I don't understand - Norma Shearer was getting Oscar Nominations like crazy all  through the 30's for films that weren't NEARLY this good (Romeo and Juliet,  A Free Soul, Marie Antoinette) and yet the Academy passed her up on this  one (most of her nominations were given to her out of sympathy - her hubby  Irving Thalberg, who had died in 1937, was EXTREMELY well-liked in  Hollywood).  Shearer and Joan Crawford both are excellent in this film (the  scene they have in the dressing room together is pure electricity), and  Rosalind Russell's Sylvia Fowler is just spectacular . . man oh man, WHY  DIDN'T THIS WOMAN EVER WIN AN OSCAR!  (There is no such thing as a  &quot;bad Rosalind Russell movie.&quot;) By rights Roz should have made the  AFI list of top female actresses, I guess they think, who needs personality  when you have Marilyn Monroe . . . But the acting all around is first rate  - Mary Boland is spectacular as the Countess de Lave, Phyllis Povah plays  Edith Potter, the role she originated on Broadway, to perfection, Marjorie  Main plays what might be called a precursor to her  &quot;Ma Kettle&quot;  character of the '50's, the gorgeous Paulette Goddard is outstanding, not  to mention Joan Fontaine, Lucile Watson, Virginia Wiedler, Hedda Hopper as  a gossip columnist, and a little-known actress named Florence Nash who is a  HOOT in the party scenes as Nancy, the &quot;old maid&quot; of the group  who is reminiscent of Dorothy Parker . . One more thing, if you like this  one, see &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; with Rosalind Russell and Coral Browne  (Amazon used to have it for sale, but as of now it's on moratorium -  hopefully they'll re-release it) - but if you've never seen this comedy, by  all means, treat yourself to it today.
B000003AEB|5.0|If you liked Dr. Dre's &quot;The Chronic&quot;, then you'll LOVE this! This is Snoop's best album ever! The best songs are Gin &amp; Juice, Lodi Dodi, Serial Killa, What's My Name, and Ain't No Fun! Every single rap fan  in the world needs The Chronic AND this in their collection!
6305090564|4.0|I love monster movies and I loved this movie from the moment I saw it. DEEP RISING benefits from an excellent Jerry Goldsmith score and a really icky (albeit obvious CGI) monster designed by the legendary Rob Bottin (the creator of John Carpenter's THE THING). Also the humor actually works for a change and did not irritate or distract me with mood destroying kamp komedy. Sommers also nicely satirizes the cliched sequel set-up ending. Its just a dumb fun monster movie, the best mega-budget piece of schlock Roger Corman never made.
B00000J6AG|5.0|I didn't think I would like this cd before I bought it. I am not a big techno fan.  But the reviews for this cd were so highly in praise of it, I thought I would give it a chance.<br />It is amazing.  My favorite songs are  Porcelain and Why does my heart feel so bad?  But, I don't think there are  really any bad songs on here.  (I personally don't like BodyRock, but that  doesn't make it a bad song.)<br />After listening to this cd, I definitely  want to look for more work by Moby.
B000002C1W|4.0|I was not going to buy this album because I am mostly interested in Pink Floyd with the classic line-up:  Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Richard Wright, and Nick Mason.  This album was made by what might be called Pink Floyd  III.  Pink Floyd I was led by Syd Barrett, who lost his mind and was kicked  out after one album.  Pink Floyd II was that of Waters and Gilmour -- one  of the greatest hard-rock bands of all time -- and was torn asunder, as the  story goes, during the making of \\"The Wall\\" as Waters and Gilmour  feuded, and Wright was addicted to drugs and was officially kicked out of  the band (though kept on as a contract player).  Pink Floyd III is led by  Gilmour, still has Mason as a member, and still keeps Wright on as a  contract performer (Wright is not in the photos displayed in the liner  notes and his name is in small print; apparently Gilmour still did not  trust him after \\"The Wall\\" experience).  Pink Floyd III also had  to win a lawsuit brought by Waters in order to use the Pink Floyd name  (Waters gets a share of the money Pink Floyd III makes and credit for the  flying pig that Pink Floyd III features in their concerts).    Anyway, I  went ahead and bought his album.    And it really packed a punch.  I did not  realize how much great material was on this album.  And I believe that most  people who buy this album will have the same reaction:  Hey!  I remember  this song!  It used to be on the radio all the time!      Songs like  \\"Learning to Fly\\", \\"The Dogs of War\\", \\"One  Slip\\" (especially this one!), and \\"On the Turning Away\\" --  there!  I've named four songs out of ten on this album that will be  familiar to anyone who listened to the radio circa 1987.    And yes, even  without the Waters, this album is still unmistakeably Pink Floyd, with the  Gilmour guitar, Wright keyboards (I don't know what happened after this  album, but I hope Gilmour let Wright back into the group officially), and  Mason drums.
B000001ES4|5.0|This is the best of all 3 of their CD's.  If you like what you hear from the music clips, I promise you'll love the entire CD.  Close your eyes as you listen and drift off to Ireland.  Great for lowering the blood pressure  and relieving stress.
B00002E233|4.0|Finally there is a killer shark movie that is every bit as thrilling as JAWS was/is. I saw this movie on opening night and loved loved loved it. Sure the sharks are better developed than the people and the movie is, in and of itself, a retelling of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, it still rocks. The effects are outstanding and the sharks have a reason for not behaving like real sharks, they are ENHANCED. I also heartily recommend reading William R. Dantz's novel HUNGER, which this movie very suspiciously resembles in the concept department (genetically engineered mako sharks hunting people in packs). Thinks Renny, I now forgive you for CLIFFHANGER.
B000002UJQ|5.0|There is talk of this album having a deep message.  who gives a damn!   The truth is this is the most beautiful music you will ever hear.  I can lay down and listen to this music and forget who I am for an hour and then  realize I have a whole lifetime left before I can feel a piece of heaven  again.  I encourage everyone to experience this too by listening to this  album.
B000002J1L|3.0|I like &quot;Nursery Cryme,&quot; but ... I'm a huge Genesisfan, but even I must admit this album is somewhat dated and stiff inspots, and the sound is less than dynamic. Still, buy it and judge for yourself; it's certainly worth your time. Note that &quot;Musical Box&quot; and &quot;Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot; are much improved on the CD &quot;Genesis Live.&quot; END
1577311523|5.0|This book was recommended to me by an intuitive - I cannot thank her enough.  There are many self-help books out there that churn out the same messages in differently packaged ways (I should know, I've read so many of  them!).  But there are only three books I have read that have struck the  very core of me, the part of me deep down that has known the truth all  along, but needed help in waking up to it.  Paulo Coelho's 'The Alchemist'  was the first, Neale Donald Walsh's 'Coversations with God' trilogy the  second, and Eckhart Tolle's 'The Power of Now' the third.  Having read this  book, what previously seemed so elusive now actually feels within my reach  - call it awakening, elightenment - I call it Being Me.

0316920045|1.0|Look, I enjoy experimental fiction.  When authors trust their readers enough to challenge them, I cheer.  I do not, however, enjoy books that break promises, and like it or not that's exactly what Infinite Jest  does.<br />Unlike other unconventional novels, such as the works of the  oft-mentioned Thomas Pynchon, this one seems to prefer nasty tricks to  genuine communication - it implies it's going to tell a complete if  complicated story and doesn't deliver.  That's the sort of thing  well-educated showoffs do.  It's one thing to subvert expectations, quite  another to waste someone's time.  Infinite Jest is nothing more than a  shaggy-dog story.<br />Consider this: At the beginning of this book we meet a  gifted young tennis player at an admissions interview for a prestigious  college.  Something is seriously wrong with him - his handlers desperately  try to keep him quiet, but it's no use, he tries to speak for himself and  babbles insanely.  Cut to Chapter 2, one year earlier, and this same young  man functions beautifully, quite in his right mind.  Clearly, the novel  intends to explain what happened to him, right?  Well, close to a thousand  pages later we not only don't know what happened to him, we don't even have  him in the narrative anymore.  That's worse than a mistake, it's a  cheat.<br />Don't get me wrong, David Foster Wallace has plenty of great ideas  and a skillful way with the language, but it doesn't add up to anything -  that's the frustration.  For instance, in addition to the young tennis  star, we meet dozens of other brilliantly-conceived characters and learn  the fates of exactly none of them.  The settings are elegantly detailed,  from a tennis high school full of secret passages to the train-station  restroom home of a dying junkie, and none of them have any impact on any  character from the first page to the last.  The time period described, a  few years into the world's future, includes several intriguing postulations  from our current society, all of them dead ends.  There's a cult for ugly  people, a cross-dressing federal agent, a group of terrorists in  wheelchairs, a lost movie that captures the minds of all who view it, and  couple hundred more ingenious devices, not one of which changes a damn  thing.  Wallace's famous footnotes are more engaging than his story.<br />In  all fairness, this author probably set himself an impossible task; he has  tried, like many another writer, to encompass an entire world in his pages.  Unlike others, he doesn't know when to shut up.  Infinite Jest reads as  though he wrote until he got bored, then stopped and foisted the results  off on the world.  If he couldn't finish what he started, the least he  could do is keep it to himself.<br />Some have said that those who don't like  Infinite Jest should stick to pulp romances, but the issue is not  comprehensibility; it's the covenant with the reader, which says that a  book should deliver what it promises.  Infinite Jest, I repeat, doesn't do  that.  I'm delighted that so many have gotten so much pleasure out of this  doorstop of a book - at least all those trees died for some useful purpose  - but that doesn't excuse David Foster Wallace, who by the evidence of this  work seems to believe that mere cleverness is enough to produce good  writing.  He's wrong.<br />Benshlomo says, Don't make promises you can't  keep.society, all of them dead ends.

B00003W8NM|5.0|The film that is &quot;Fight Club&quot; carries itself from the start to the final climax.  Based on the excellent novel by Chuck P., &quot;Fight Club&quot; eximplifies the teachings of Tyler Durden(Pitt)towards his  predecessors and most importantly, the nameless protagonist played  brilliantly by Edward Norton.  The fact that this film touches on fighting  as a source of redefining the male self and one's personal masculinity is  just the tip of the iceberg.  This film goes deep into the soul and  questions the very thought of who you are and why you are here.  Do you  have a choice in anything?  Maybe.  I won't tell. David Fincher's work as a  director keeps snowballing as one of the top in the business right now.   Money doesn't define the director, the film does.  Fincher captures the  very essence that the novelist brought to the reader of the book.  The  darkness, realness, and bloodiness that the savoring novel did and found  with twists and turns throughout.   The players, Pitt, Norton, and  Bonham-Carter took the characters to the level that was needed as well as  the supporting roles which are all essential in the plot's form.  Backed  with the awe inspiring soundtrack by the Dust Brothers, the feel of the  film and sound swept the viewer in and didn't let go until the point was  made and visualized consciously.   This film got a lot of slack from  critical minds alike but I don't think they got the main point.  The  violence is hard at times to stomach, but the viewer has to look deeper and  find the message that this film ultimately portrays.   One of the best  films of 1999, &quot;Fight Club&quot; is one tough cinematic pleasure.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I never was much of a fan of the rock/rap fusion. But I have changed my mind completely because of Limp Bizkit. This band is fresh off the grill with some major instrumental power and a great voice backing it up. I would  categorize Limp Bizkit and their crushing sophomore offering 'Significant  Other' a true rock classic. Why I say rock? Well, being a huge guitar fan  (Steve Vai, Liquid Tension), and also loving every single string Korn pulls  out of their 7-strings, Limp's Wes Borland is a really vivid performer  whose quick execution of riffs on this album is extraordinary.  'Re-arranged' is a very powerful piece as the melody really moves the  listener. 'Nookie' is an aggresive song for those times when you want to  let off a little steam and yell at the wall for 5 minutes. The different  musical atmospheres Limp explores are truly a sound to behold. My favorite  effort though is 'Don't go off wandering' where the band explores that  disturbing little place in our minds, that scarry hole. It's one of those  aggresive/crying songs which cause chaos in your head. In other words, Limp  Bizkit has pulled off a truly incredible album which is worth checking out.  A 5 star classic!
B00002DE2L|5.0|Anne-Sophie Mutter has raised my love for Classical music to a new level. Her passion and intensity in Four Seasons has captured me. I simply cannot stop listening to the CD.  Mutter is known as a very passionate performer  and on this CD she comes through with flying colors. I would also say that  she is drawing in a new audience with her casual dress and innovative CD  covers. It is not very often that I call my friends and tell them they must  buy a particular CD. With this one I did. I can't wait for her next  release.
6305342776|5.0|Oh, my. . . this is bad.  The writing is terrible, the effects are dated (but not bad) and the direction is just plain icky (same guy who did Gomer Pyle).  You MUST see this movie to believe it.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Very good movie. The scenes are shot very well, with brilliant color, and it is very lifelike. Russell Crowe gives a great performance, even though he doesn't act exactly like Dr. Wigand did. The story is very compelling  and interesting, which was hard to do since I have kept up to date with it.  I guess I am biased because I was a student of his for 3 of the 3 1/2 years  he was there, but it was still a very good movie. Anyway, it is a great  mostly-true story that is well written, well directed, and just plain good.  I would recommend it for everyone, even smokers.
0790740443|4.0|A very promising idea is not fully realized in Soldier. It opens exceptionaly and is looking extremely promising, but then Kurt Russel lands on the trash planet and he starts becoming more human, which takes far too long. Russels charactor Todd speaks less than his Snake Plissken charactor  and he is pretty uninteresting. But then in the Last Half-hour Action takes  over and there is a full-on violent on-slaught which makes you forget all  the films flaws. Acting is credible and the set designs are great. Paul  Anderson has proved with Soldier and Event Horizen that he knows what he is  doing when it comes to Sci-Fi. All around.. It's no classic, but the last  half hour is reason enough to buy it.  Plus.. It has Kurt Russel.

B000002UY5|4.0|For me, this is the kind of album which makes the selection features of CD technology worth having.  I only have two favorite songs on this album at this time.  When I bought it, &quot;No Rain&quot; was the only one that I  ever wanted to hear.  Then someone who knew about my interest in the  therapeutic use of music suggested that I listen to the song  &quot;Change&quot; on this album, and I already owned it.  I don't care  about how much other people might dislike the other songs on this album.   Any group that could get together to play the song &quot;Change&quot; is  begging for forgiveness for all the songs that they have done that other  people didn't like.  No one has to listen to these songs to see how sorry  they are, but there are times when I would recommend it.

Some of the tracks were good, granted, but Incesticide does NOT live up to Nirvana's best. But despite all that, it's fair...I'd still recommend the CD, but don't expect something like In  Utero, or even Bleach.

It's one tragic scene after the other, yet I found myself constantly laughing out loud because of his humorous outlook on life. (I cried a few times as well). When I feel sorry for myself, I think about what his life was like in Ireland, and it puts me in my place.  His life was truly an adventure worth reading--I simply did not want it to  end--I can't wait to read \\"T'is!\\"

B00003CWN3|3.0|While Mr. Stanley Nemeth's review is certainly articulate and I agree with him about the moral emptiness of &quot;American Beauty&quot; I found &quot;Boy's Don't Cry&quot;  to be a fascinating story which was motivated by a real event and was brilliant in performance and script.It might be  &quot;knocking at an already open door,&quot; as Mr. Nemeth states, but we  do not enter this door without fresh horror at the kind of ignorance and  brutality that lies inside that darkened room.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Yes, this was the best film of last year, but to really apprectiate it you must understand it.  The film is about the society we live in, the society that tells us to spend our money until we are happy, to gain as much as possible to be succesful.  It is also about how society has certain guidelines for the sexes, ex. men shouldn't cry or show their feelings in a  public setting. Fight Club is about men who see these  aspects of society  and choose to not buy into the false ideas of it.  They decide to start  fight clubs were they will be able to fight eachother in order to feel that  they are &quot;real&quot;.  They do this because in a fight you are the  focus of the attention and you are in control of your life. There are no  bosses telling you what to do, you make the descisions. The men in this  movie want to feel they have worth, that they have a power that can't be  taken away. Unfortunetly, as the movie shows, violence is not the answer to  freeing yourself from negative surroundings.  I don't see how people can  say this movie encourages violence. Look at what happens to Bob and the  blonde haired man among others. And if these images weren't  enough the ending shows that the actions that take place were done by  someone totally insane, a person unable to deal with what was around him.  Do these events sound like they encourage violence?  Fight Club shows the  horrible physical and mental damage that can occur when people try to do  good, but focus their anger and energy in the wrong place.  What may have  thrown people off is the dark humor placed throughout the movie. People  didn't realize that certain scenes could be dark and funny while others  could just be dark and violent without the humor, showing the chaos that  results from the descions made. Fight Club is a very fun interesting movie  that is nowhere near as violent as people make it out to be. There is  actually very little fighting in the entire movie. Do yourself a favor,  check it out, and you will see what an amazing movie it is.

B000002C1W|2.0|Roger Waters has astutely said that this album is a \\"pretty good imitation\\" of Pink Floyd. Though the guy has shown himself to be a total egomaniac over the years, I have to admit he's right, especially after comparing the entire Floyd catalog, starting at album one, with \\"A Momentary Lapse...\\". This album tries and largely fails to capture those drawn out, brooding instrumentals that were so unique in the Floyd repetoire. In fact, the back half of this album is so excruciatingly boring, you begin to wonder if the talented [[ASIN:B000ELJBAK David Gilmour]] and his slew of cohorts were resting on their laurels and just cranking this one out for the almighty dollar. I can't fault Gilmour for the first two songs -- those stand up well. But the hopeful anthem, \\"On the Turning Away,\\" as well as \\"Dogs of War,\\" are pretty much garbage when compared to past Floyd work and Gilmour's formidable solo albums. As I said (and Waters before me), this is a cheap imitation of a formerly great four-piece band. Buy old Floyd or Gilmour's two solo albums instead.
B000031WD9|4.0|OK so I think to myself, &quot;I need a dumb movie that will make me laugh a lot.&quot; If you are thinking the same thing, this is it. You don't have to think at all, just sit down and prepare to laugh.
B000002JNG|4.0|With a name like Robert Plant, you can afford to hire the best musicians for your solo albums. Plant recruited them for \\"Manic Nirvana,\\" big hair and all (check out their pics in the CD sleeve). Doug Boyle plays a mean guitar with a flaunting style that would make Jimmy Page proud. As for Plant, his voice is strong and this album has a vibrant, modern feel that gives it a leg up, in some respects, when compared to certain Led Zeppelin albums (see [[ASIN:B000002J01 Led Zeppelin 1]] and [[ASIN:B000002J03 Led Zeppelin II]]).<br /><br />If you like larger-than-life Zeppelin riffs, they're featured on \\"Manic Nirvana.\\" \\"Hurting Kind,\\" \\"Big Love,\\" \\"She Said,\\" Nirvana\\" and \\"Tie Dye on the Highway\\" (perhaps the album's highlight, guitar-wise). \\"Big Love\\" even contains a Def Leppard-like \\"Hey!\\" parts in the chorus to give the song a bit of a 1980s flavor. \\"Hurting Kind,\\" with its made-for-air-guitar riff and gosh-we-luv-hot-girls lyrics, has a definte Zeppelin and '80s vibe as well.<br /><br />One gets the sense that Plant was having fun during this time period, writing arena-rock music, catchy choruses and, in some instances, frivolous lyrics. The more interesting tunes on this CD might be the toned-down ones such as \\"I Cried,\\" \\"Your Ma Said You Cried...,\\" \\"Anniversary\\" and especially \\"Liars Dance,\\" a beautiful song with some angular acoustic guitar and affecting lyrics. The following tune, \\"Watching You,\\" though much different, is as equally impressive. Tribal drums, tuned-down guitars, a prominent synth sound and desperately sung lyrics by Plant make \\"Watching You\\" the perfect song to close out the CD.<br /><br />\\"Manic Nirvana\\" isn't the most important album that Robert Plant has been involved with in his career, but it does have some very good moments. Interestingly, this CD sits at the outer fringes of the '80s metal music frenzy that preceded it, and there's a tinge of that era within it. However, Plant was astute enough to look in both a forward and backward musical direction, and was therefore able to offer a fresh coat of paint to some rough-edged '70's riffage, mixed with a newer-sounding, more layered production that was actually frowned upon by 1991 due to another musical nirvana.erefore able to offer a fresh coat of paint to some rough-edged '70's riffage, mixed with a newer-sounding, more layered production that was actually frowned upon by 1991 due to another musical nirvana.
6305076626|5.0|I've been seeing this every New Years Eve for quite some time, and only recently have I fully understood it. It's self-parody, and I like it a lot. Whenever Frank-n-furter shrieks at Rocky, I think its so funny. Tim Curry is very promising, he has a lot of charisma. Eddie is brilliant too, and  Columbia shines in the floor show. The Time-Warp is sort of over-played,  but still great. <br />I can't imagine how some of you didn't like this. I  realize its a really pathetic and cheap attempt at a movie, but when life  gives you lemons, make lemonade. And this movie did.
B00000JJQK|5.0|I won't say anything about the album, except, like many others, I consider it to be one of the finest pop recordings.  I want to focus on the sound of the stereo remix (starting on track 15).  I was at first skeptical about  the remix, because they usually don't improve the recording.  I also  wondered how you could improve Pet Sounds at all.  Well, simply put, I was  BLOWN AWAY by the sound of this remix!  Mark Linnett has done a masterful  job bringing out the musical wonder of this album. On each track, I feel  like I can stand up and walk around each instrumental track.  The sound is  very pure, with no hint of the inherent distortion of the original  recording's mono mixdown.  It gives a life and air to the recording that I  never would have imagined.  Those of you listening on a true hi-fi rig will  really appreciate this recording.  I have no reason to ever listen to the  mono mix again - that's how impressed I am with this CD!  It has been  playing constantly in my machine since I brought it home.  I know it sounds  like a cliche, but hearing this remix IS like hearing Pet Sounds for the  very first time. Enjoy!
B000002KET|5.0|Before having this album, i knew Black Sabbath as an excellent hard rock band that put most of the roots of the heavy metal genre. I had heard some classics like &quot;war pigs&quot;, &quot;paranoid&quot; and &quot;iron  man&quot; and i liked them pretty much. But then i decided to buy this  record, my first Sabbath one. And it didnt let me down. If you like  progressive  rock, classic rock, hard rock, then you must buy this album  because it is a magnificent piece of real art. It is powerful, sensitive,  the lyrics are intelligent, poetic (something i discovered to be common in  Black Sabbaths Ozzy era, the &quot;Master of reality&quot; also show great  lyrics), and the music is fascinating. The compositions are a well done mix  of hard-rock power chords with progressive and pop melodies, that its  interpreted by the main three instruments frame with the help of keyboards  and flutes.  Finally, the album is enriched with the participation of Rick  Wakeman on keyboards.
B000002546|5.0|This album is the best rock instrumental album period. It's also one of the great all-time albums. There are only so many albums where every song is solid (Sgt. Pepper, Led Zep II, Nevermind) and this is one of them. It's  the pinnacle of rock instrumental music, using a basic  guitar/bass/elec.piano/drums format that creates something greater than the  sum of the parts. It's in wonderful stereo with stellar production by the  great George Martin, and is an interesting ride when listened to from edge  to label. My favorites are: &quot;AIR Blower&quot;,  &quot;Scatterbrain&quot;, and &quot;Freeway Jam&quot;. Definitely a triumph  of substance over style!
0380973464|4.0|Stephenson does a great job in Crytonomicon as in his preceding works, with his trademark prose.  The intricate detail and the humor are all there, together with references to areas such as mathematics and Tolkein  which some readers may find unfamiliar.<br />A rollerblading girl is present  as usual, even if she makes only a token appearance at the airport.<br />The  book is a great read with numerous humorous gems such as the dinner party  and the adventures in the Philippines' jungle.<br />Crytonomicon will make you  laugh out loud and is very difficult to put down.<br />In as much that I  enjoyed reading it, as I did &quot;Snow Crash&quot;,  &quot;Zodiac&quot;  and &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;, however, I believe that the book suffers  in one aspect.<br />The book displays a plot convergence not unlike the graph  of Waterhouse's Ndecrypts vs Mental clarity - which I felt was markedly  similar to  &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;.<br />Things fell together in the last  few chapters at a rate that was astounding.  This would be very  disappointing if the book was just some run-of-the-mill novel, but the  great reading is not just the plot, but the descriptions, the characters,  the digressions and the peripheral events.<br />Strongly recommended.
B000002BPS|5.0|WHat does it matter what the critics think? My friends and I listened to this and it is EASILY the best. I mean, the other 4 are really good but every song on this album is great! Buy this one!
B00000JCOV|5.0|Okay, well first of all I gotta say that this is one of thebest CD's  I got! Most of it is pretty hard, but it's all reallygood. I can't say that there are any bad songs on it, but if you don't like the screaming effect, this really isn't a good CD for ya. This is  one of those CD's you can listen to when your [angry], cuz it fits the  mood. But over all it's the tightest CD and you gotta get it! But if  you do get the new release with Putirty on it!
0892818875|5.0|Gabriel Mojay's magnificent book is divided into 3 parts. The first reviews aromatheraphy basics and then succinctly connects this therapy with Yin/Yang of traditional chinese medicine, the 5-element theory and astrology. The second part reviews 40 individual essential oils with  emphasis on the their energies and psychotherapy properties. The third part  concentrates on the individual oils and blends and includes accupressure  points to treat different unbalanced mental states such as &quot;anger and  frustration&quot;, &quot;poor concentration and memory&quot; and an  excellent and very detailed entry on depression including restoring balance  by the 5-element theory. The book is concise, superbly layed-out with many  pictures, illustrations and charts. I find myself consulting it with great  frequency. It should be in the library of every holistic aromatologist.
0375703764|4.0|This book is really a lot of fun, but it is certainly not for someone who expects something like Stephen King.  I bought this book and started reading it before I heard all of the &quot;hype&quot;.  It took me about  three pages and all I could think of was Infinite Jest (and not Stephen  King).  The book pokes fun at academia and its tendency to overanalyze ad  nauseum.  He's got two interesting stories intertwined, but frankly it took  me a while to get into the story of the house, while Johnny Truant's story  I found interesting from the get go.  I would recommend this book to  someone who enjoys David Foster Wallace and who is not afraid to read  footnotes.  I completely disagree with some of the reviewers here who  recommend skipping the footnotes.  Frankly, they don't get it, and you  won't either if you skip them.  If you like Stephen King and want a scary  novel, wait for his next book.
B00000348D|5.0|A fantastic, landmark album that should make the heads of all Kenny G fans explode violently over their stereo speakers.  As a tip for neophytes, during the more chaotic sections, try listening to just one of the two  quartets featured on the album at a given time, tuning out the other one.   Then switch to the other quartet.  Repeat several times, then finally put  the two quartets together and it should all start to make a certain degree  of sense, if only for a brief moment until your brain can no longer keep  the various musical lines together anymore and you are forced to start all  over again.  My favourite parts of the album are without a doubt the two  trance-like bass duets, which sound almost far-eastern.  Despite having  listened to this album at least a dozen times, I still jump out of my seat  when the reed and horn players violently intrude into the temporary calm  created by the bassists.
B000002J1H|5.0|From the time I heard Close To The Edge, I was a changed person.  But Going For The One ranks right there with it as one of the best albums by any group.  Some don't like the title track that much, but to me it's  driving rhythm is almost as entrancing in it's own way as Awaken.  Steve  Howes' steel guitar cuts through your mind and is a perfect accompianment  to the chant-like chorus.  Turn Of The Century is simply the most beautiful  and artistic &quot;love&quot; song I've ever heard, and Parallels is an  uplifting anthem for the human potential.  Wonderous Stories is a whimsical  journey into fantasy, and one of their best short songs.    Then comes  Awaken.  Nearly every reviewer has heaped the highest praise upon this  epic--and for good reason.  I would gladly pay full price for this cd even  if Awaken were the only song on it!  I will not try to describe this  song--if you've not heard it then stop right now and buy the cd.  Only by  listening can you understand what we've all tried to say about Awaken.  I  think it's a personal experience that everyone must have.
B0000021RD|1.0|Ditto my review of Chicago Transit Authority.<br />&quot;Colour My World&quot; and &quot;25 Or 6 to 4&quot; are the only two cuts on this CD that aren't painful to listen to.  Well, OK, maybe &quot;Where Do We Go  From Here&quot; as well.  <br />Thankfully, Chicago found where to go--as far  away from this material as possible!
B00003BDXG|5.0|This film really does keep getting better and better. I keep finding new lines that make me laugh, new images that shock me. It is one hell of a rollar coaster ride. Natural Born Killers and Fear and loathing in Las  Vegas are definately THE most hallucinatory Films of the 90's, possable  ever. Woody and Julliette are Brilliant, Mickey and Mallory are the roles  of a lifetime. The entire cast are exceptional. Tommy Lee Jones makes his  Two-Face role look Subtle and Robert Downey Jr has never been better.  Oliver Stone's flashy Directing style was ecential to the film, in any  other hands it would probably not have worked. Stand out scenes consist of  the Mallory sitcom, (Rodney Dangerfield hasn't been that funny in years)  and the prison escape. Love it or loathe it, Natural born Killers is a  force to be reconed with. <br />P.S The Directors Cut Is the Best Directors  Cut ever Released. Absolutely full of added stuff.
B0000021RB|1.0|Let me preface my review by saying I am a huge Chicago fan.  I saw their Christmas concert and wanted to wave my candle and help some young lovely body-surf the audience.  I had a few of their albums and didn't think I  could go wrong with their first two.  I was wrong!<br />This CD is pretentious  and self-indulgent.  Titles like &quot;Poem&quot;, &quot;Free Form  Guitar&quot; (hey, look, I can play, let me show you), and  &quot;Prologue&quot; should have tipped me off.  &quot;Does Anybody Really  Know What Time It Is?&quot; is the only cut on the CD that is indicative of  things to come.  Thankfully they didn't play any of the rest of this  hodge-podge in their set.<br />Skip this one, children!
B000002KL3|4.0|Alright, When you hear Van Halen you think VH1, 1984, and 5150 (even though it's not Dave, it's a trademark album).  Well guess what, this might be their best album.  It's definitly their most consistantly heavy album  (only Could This Be Magic   is mellow), it also contains some of the  coolest EVH riffs and hooks ever.  The intro to Everbody Wants Some has  more cool guitar work than most rock albums combined.  Then there's the  blistering  Loss of Control and Romeo Delight, the goof ball Take Your  Whiskey Home, and the hard rock love song In Simple Rhyme.  Fools, the  instrumental Tora Tora and And the Cradle Will Rock fill out the album in  fine fashion.  It's heavy, dark and funny all in one.  This album just  rocks from front to back and puts most other Van Halen stuff (even though  it's all outstanding) to shame.
B00003CWRX|5.0|I can't get this film or its subject out of my mind. Maybe it's because as a health care worker I see the devastating effects of tobacco every day in my patients. The pain and suffering it causes make Dr. Wigand's cause noble  and worth the price he paid to bring tobacco companies out in the open. I  know that some of the facts have been Hollywoodized for the film but that  doesn't diminish its power,. If you have ever doubted the power of Big  Tobacco this film will convince you otherwise. It is the only product that  when used as directed kills people. Splendid work by Mr. Crowe, who should  have won this year's Oscar. Should be required viewing for anyone who  treats smokers.

B000001Y2U|5.0|Marilyn Manson is a name that encapsules a lot to say. Manson is a very strenge person, he just love doing things to disturbe people with weak minds. Face it, if you have a strong mind you can really say something meaningful about Manson, nevermind whether you love him or hate him.  Anticrhist Superstar IS NOT an album for everyone, if you love to listen yo  really hard sounds and disturbing / violent / thoughtful lyrics, then this  is a CD for you. It's one of my fav CDs from the 90s. Sometimes it can be  really sad, sometimes really nerve breaking and angry. But you can't  say it's got no importance.

0425152251|4.0|Sophie's World by far was benefitial, especially for someone who was begining an interest in philosophy.  It puts 3000 years of western philosophy into the perspective of an adolescent quite successfully.  The  odd story line is essentially the only thing that destinguishes the novel  from a text book.  Unfortunately, that story line is rather weak and the  conclusion is awful.  However, it is definitely worth reading.   The end.

B00000JL86|5.0|Don Bluth is my hero, seeing American Tail in 1986 when I was barely four and and seeing a beautifully animated character who I could relate to (Feivel). Now I look back over the years, and realize that he can do  anything. When he makes a movie, its never an &quot;Attempt&quot;, but  always a masterpiece. I realize it was hard to depart from his beloved  cels, because he is an old-fashioned animator, who is essentially a kid at  heart. He has to be. <br />In Anastasia, Bluth brings to life the story of the  legendary Romanov Princess. I found the tale to be funny, but most of all,  gripping. My favorite part was when the ghosts danced out of their  paintings and danced with Anya in &quot;Once Upon a December&quot;. I found  myself, watching alone whispering &quot;My God...&quot; because it was the  most incredible thing I have ever seen him do...well...one of them at  least... ; ) Bottom line, if it says &quot;Don Bluth, Gary Goldman, John  Pomeroy&quot; on it...no matter what it is...Whether it be Pebble and the  Penguin or Titan AE...American Tail or Anastasia...you are in for a treat.
0440234743|1.0|&quot;The Testament&quot; was my first - and LAST - John Grisham novel.  I read it because I had heard from so many others what a wonderful writer Grisham was.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  I was not in any way inspired or uplifted by this book which has been, in many cases, classified  as &quot;spiritual&quot;.  It was full of unrealistic, stereotypical  characters, with none of which I could relate or sympathize in the least.   The only humorous parts of the book were those in which the misplaced  modifiers gave the sentence a meaning far from that which I suspect was  intended.  In my own personal opinion, taking a book, of which the first  two-thirds consist of vile people uttering obsenities every other breath,  and adding a &quot;reformation&quot;, a preacher, and a missionary in the  end does not make for a spiritual novel.  This book may have been enjoyable  to others, but it definitely was not my style.
0812523334|5.0|I thought this book was great.  It is one of the most influential books I have every read.  I love all of Louisa May Alcott's books because they have good morals and lessons in them.  I also would like to say to the ealier  reviewer who thougth this book was &quot;Extremely Fictional&quot; because  of how perfect the family is, this book is based on a real family and the  character Jo is based on Louisa herself.  Families really can be that  happy.  I would highly reccomend this book and any of Louisa May Alcott's  books
0553213342|5.0|I have read all of Jane Austen's novels at least once, and&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is, at the moment, my favorite,because it was the last one I read.  Jane Austen is - and always willbe - my absolute favorite writer.  I love the way she can take just an average person and reveal the hero or heroine inside.<br />This is just what she does with Elinor and Marianne Dashwood.  The central theme of this novel is not the love between a boy and a girl; it is about the love between two sisters and how they come to a better understanding of each other when they are forced to endure similar situations and handle them in completely different manners.<br />When each sister, through dissimilar circumstances, discovers that the happiness she had believed she would find in marriage is not to be, it at first appears that Elinor is rather cold and heartless - more worried about propriety than feelings - and that Marianne is more in touch with her emotions and would rather express her grief than take into account how her display will affect those who love her...<br />As for the relationship between the sisters, at the beginning, Marianne seems to pity Elinor for her lack of esteem for art and poetry, and she believes that Edward is not worthy of her.  Elinor, while seeing the youthful faults of her sister, always keeps a sense of humour and does everything out of love for her and the rest of the family.  In the middle, Marianne believes that no one has ever suffered as she, and continues to pity Elinor for her inadequacies...<br />This is a wonderful and deeply moving novel that should be read more than once to be thoroughly understood and appreciated.
B000000WA4|5.0|I know that that's a very controversial statement but that'swhat i think: this is the best album of all time, and let me explainto you why I think that way. A while back, about a year ago, my father passed away and it was a very hard time for me, and the only album I listened to was this album, and it helped me deal with my emotions so much and I am very grateful to the Smashing Pumpkins for making this music that can help you deal with your emotions so much. Every single song on this album is breath-taking, sweeping, and genius. Another great thing about this album is that it has a wide range of music type, form a full piano song to the Metallica-influenced Zero. Here's what I think of every song:<br />&quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; is a great piano song, it's very soothing. &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; has a great sound with great lyrics. &quot;Jellybelly&quot; is a great song to just rock out to. &quot;Zero&quot; is a song with great guitar riffs and great lyrics, one of the best songs on the album. &quot;Here Is No Why&quot; is a song that has a great song with a great title, don't you think? &quot;Bullet With Butterfly Wings&quot; is a great song with a great guitar arrangement.  &quot;To Forgive&quot; has great lyrics and it's very soothing. &quot;F*.. You (An Ode to No One) is a very good upbeat song. &quot;Love&quot; is very interesting because of the razor sounding guitars! &quot;Cupid de Locke&quot; is a very interesting song that you could get married to.  &quot;Galapogos&quot; has a great climax to it. &quot;Muzzle&quot; is a very fun song to listen to and to play on guitar. &quot;Porcelina of the Vast Oceans&quot; is just plain great. &quot;Take Me Down&quot; is a song with wonderful lyrics. &quot;Where the Boys Fear to Tread&quot; has great guitar riffs. &quot;Bodies&quot; is a song that you can just jump around to. &quot;Thirty-Three&quot; is one of the best songs ever! &quot;In the Arms of Sleep&quot; has a great sound to it. &quot;1979&quot; is a song that you can just lay down on the couch and think of what Billy's saying.  &quot;Tales of the Scorched Earth&quot; is a great rocking song. Then &quot;Thru the Eyes of Ruby' which is, to me, the greatest song I've ever heard, I love it!  &quot;Stumbeline&quot; has great lyrics.  &quot;X.Y.U&quot; is another great rocking song. &quot;We Only Come Out At Night&quot; has a great sound to it too. &quot;Beautiful&quot; is a very soothing song. &quot;Lily (My One and Only)&quot; is another soothing song.  &quot;By Starlight&quot; has great lyrics. And &quot;Farewell and Goodnight&quot; is a great song to end the album with. They're all great, you should definitely go out and get this album today!  END
0345409671|5.0|I was somewhat hesitant to read this after the slightly disappointing 'Tale of the Body Thief' but when I picked it up, I could scarce put it down until I had devoured it. A marvellous book with all we've come to expect from Rice's masterful storytelling. Some of the content may offend  the more sensitive of you (especially where religious beliefs are strongly  held, particularly Christianity) but the whole thing is handled so well  that you would have to be a real prude to find fault.<br />Nevertheless, some  of you may. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and think it a highly original  tale that you will most certainly enjoy.
B000002KIE|5.0|....An essential, historical document, to be sure. To really appreciate what the pistols were about, you would have to have been around, suffering the God-awful music that was being offered by popular artists and media back then.  In this context, \\"Bollocks\\" is the right term. People  just didn't put their feelings into words, or write about what was real  then. Tame by today's standards, it was positively threatening at the time.   And unlike most popular artists then and now, there really wasn't a weak  track on the record.   Sadly, this album does not really represent the true  sound of the Pistols, though. By the band's own admission this release was  over-produced and worked on far to long by record company engineers. (The  lead guitar alone was layered in something like 8 seperate tracks!)   To  hear the true Pistols, seek out the early demos, or listen to the original  Lydon tracks on \\"Swindle\\" Much more energetic, raw, and  representative.  Still, \\"Bollocks\\" is about all there was, and  is, from the band that changed my mind about \\"Rock and Roll\\"- not  to mention an entire generation of music.   Still sends chills down my  spine - something today's \\"alternative\\" music (alternative to  what?) has never done.
6303961665|2.0|'The Greatest Story Ever Told' is told wwaayy too slow and in a very conventional, uninteresting manner. It's not Stevens' fault but Hollywood's, although the neverending parade of movie stars -that gets tiresome and somewhat funny after a short while- was the director's idea. Haendel's 'Messiah' doesn't help either: it's been done and sounds much too corny!<br />Wonderful actor as he is, Max Von Sydow plays Jesus as a pious blue-eyed waspy bore (Jesus was semitic)! Sure, he's not to blame either: any movie about Christ sets out an impossible task to acomplish, and no actor, no matter how intense, can fulfill that role. If on top of that you put a lot of regulations on how to deal with religious contents, the results will hardly please anyone (anyone outside the weepy, syrupy, preachy self-righteous crowd, that is).<br />For an equally conventional but much fresher, human and inspiring view, try Franco Zeffirelli's 'Jesus of Nazareth', also with an all-star cast that truly acts. Much, much better!<br />Me, I prefer the controversial movies on this subject ('The Gospel According To St. Matthew', 'Jesus of Montreal', 'Life of Brian', 'The Last Temptation of Christ', 'The Ruling Class', etc.). After all, what's the point of seeing a movie of this sort, if not for some food-for-thought? But -hey- that's just me and my tastes! By no means I recommend those pictures if you're wanting to assist your kids on Sunday school. Try the Zeffirelli version first!<br />P.S.: Donald Pleasance does a great Evil! (now that's an unfamiliar role for him!)
B0000027RL|5.0|Nothing is original in rock anymore! I lamented in the early 90's.  The I heard ten. Pure elation! Finally, originality perfectly balanced with in your face rock. Ten years later, I still listen to Pearl Jam's debut album  with reverence.  Hands down, one of the best and most influential rock  albums of all time.
B000009QPE|5.0|Slayer kills, face it kids, Korn Limp Bisquik Static-X, that is NOT metal, it is whinny rap noise, SLAYER IS METAL. Reign In Blood is Slayer at its fastest and most brutal, with their hard hitting lyrics and guitars, you  cant go wrong. Dont watch MTV, buy Slayer discs instead, KORN SUCKS
0060987464|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. THERE WAS A LOT OF STUFF IN THE BOOK THAT I NEVER KNEW ABOUT MANSON. FOR EXAMPLE THE FACT THAT HE ALMOST DIED A COUPLE OF TIMES FROM DRUG OVERDOSES. I ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHO IS A FAN OF MANSON,OR WHO DOESN'T LIKE MANSON TO READ THE BOOK. IF YOU LIKE  MANSON YOU WILL LOVE THE BOOK. IF YOU ARE AGAINST MANSON, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND  WHY HE IS THE WAY HE IS.
B0000060NH|5.0|this one surprised me. i did not expect this cd to be this excellent. no one ever talks about it. but if anyone out there is a fan of marvin gaye, this one is a must have. the first trouble man theme got me going then the  next song and the next. i hope someday this album gets the respect it  dserves.
0385495315|5.0|I recommend this book if you are interested in cryptography.  I recommended even more strongly if you are not very interested in cryptography. Why?  Because it is the first book I have read to make the subject really open to someone not eager to work at the subject.  The  author's explanations of the development of cryptography over the centuries  was strong, and his technical explanations of subjects like the German WWII  Enigma machine, the decipherment of Linear B, and public key cryptography  are absolutely outstanding.   Everything that the author tried to explain,  he did explain, in terms that almost anyone can understand.  In fact, he  made the difficulty and the work involved in good cryptography apparent,  while at the same time making it relatively easy to understand the  technology and thinking behind some of the great achievements in that  field.
B00000IQBM|4.0|I read the Shinning when I was 11, and that's how old I am now. The movie had some very scary parts (and of course &quot;REDRUM&quot;) but the book was better. I say read the book if you're one of those people who only read the book or see the movie. I did both. Read &quot;The Shinning&quot; or see  the movie!1
B000002UVZ|5.0|this was the first recording i ever bought by rem and to me it will always be there best every song on here is brilliant it is classic rem i truely recommend it. you won,t be sorry.
B000005QH3|4.0|To correct those who were mistaken the Challenger was a 426 HEMI with a hemi crashbox 4spd with a pistol grip shifter. Now on to the movie. This movie more or less is a easy rider in a car.The driver has given up on societal norms and finds peace the only way he can, behind the wheel. I  myself have enjoyed watching this movie over and over again. The only part  I didn't like was the destruction of a muscle car like the Challenger. For  those of you that live for the thrill of the chase there is none better  than this movie and Bullit.
B000002C1V|5.0|To me this is the most moving and emotional Pink Floyd album ever. <br />Roger Waters took this part 2 of The Wall far beyond the scope of any Pink Floyd album ever released. This album is not even comparable to The  Dark Side Of The Moon.  The lyrical content is not so abstract.  To many  this album speaks more truth than any book or publication.  <br />This  magnificent album should not even be compared to other Pink Floyd albums.   This is a Roger Waters solo project with David playing guitar and Nick  playing drums.  <br />This WWII tribute would be liked by anybody personally  touch by the war, like Roger was!
B00000IPAX|5.0|Many people have referred to Blink as &quot;sell-outs&quot; because of this albums success. Look at the definition of a &quot;sell-out&quot; and you will see Korn listed first thing, but no Blink. While it isn't their  best album (Dude Ranch was), it still is the same old Blink. I say buy it,  and you will see that the songs played on MTV are their worst songs because  they are the only ones tuned down enough for tv. This is NOT an album for  12 year olds!
B000001IPL|5.0|smash is one of the offsprings coolest cds. it has gotta get away, self esteem, genocide, smash, it'll be a long time, not the one........these are just my favs. hell i have yet to hear a bad offspring song. well......killboy powerhead(on this cd)is not very punk, it leans more  toward metal, and isnt even their song. other than that, this cd kicks....  so buy it!  also ignition, s/t ,and ixnay on the hombre are really cool.  americana has some really popy and annoying songs on it, so i would  recomend anything by the offspring. peace. later
B000021XS0|5.0|I have been into Dream Theater since 1992's Images and Words album and to be honest I dont think that these boys can keep getting better. Every album they bring out is better than the previous album. I would like to say to  anyone who hasnt heard D.T. before, they cannot be pigeonholed into any one  category, one minute they are thrash metal the next minute classic piano  ballad and this is the same song. This album is in my opinion the greatest  album of all time, you can not review it song by song because it is a  concept album and if you were to pick out any one song and play it you  would not have a clue what the song was about. Suffice to say the album  lasts 75 minutes but seems more like 40. Most albums have 2 really good  songs 6 or 7 average songs and 1 or 2 duffers. This album contains 7  fantastic and 5 great songs. The nearest comparison I could draw would be  Take Pink Floyd's The Wall, Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime and Elton  John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and throw them in a mixer and add the best  musicians you can think of and you have this album. BUY IT !
B00004SYWZ|5.0|This is a masterpiece no one should miss! Fantastic songs, perfectly sung by Morten &quot;agelvoice&quot; Harket.  My favorite songs on the album are &quot;Minor Earth/ Major Sky&quot; and &quot;Thought that it was you&quot;
B000002UAR|5.0|Bar none this is the crown jewel of an incredible catalog of genius musical literature! I've listened to all of them and couldn't name a favorite except for this one!Me, an island and one album, this is it. It  covers so many styles , emotions and topics you cannot be unhappy.  McCartney at his pop best( and bass line best) Lennon is the God of all  things psychedelic, Harrison tells the Gov't. where to stick it ,( and  matches his collegues song for song for the first time and Ringo  sings the  best party, drinking, happy song of all time,(not to mention his most  creative drumming ever! I  f you have $13 dollars and need to spend it ,  you won't waste a cent. I have listened and been inspired by this album  more than  any other, EVER!
B000021Y74|4.0|I mean, it's bloody amazing--there is absolutely NOTHING to this film, yet it somehow manages to be utterly compelling.  Almost the entire film consists of Lola, um, running.  Indeed, the few less-frenetic scenes really  do little more than get in the way.  But for the most part it's pure  action, and it works.  And this from someone who, as a rule, finds action  films insufferably tedious.  The direction is indeed to be commended for so  rarely letting up.  The soundtrack's perfectly done also--and this from  someone who, as a rule, violently dislikes industrial techno.  I get the  impression that if anything had been done even slightly wrong, the entire  film would have fallen apart--but nothing IS, really.  As I said, it really  doesn't have a helluva lot of substance, but it sure is a rush to watch.
B000006NPY|5.0|My title says it all, this was the best album of 1998. Dark, moody, mesmerizing and thoughtful all shaped up with a gothic twist. I agree with one of the other reviewers when they said &quot;Adore&quot; and  &quot;Machina&quot; are two sides of the same coin. &quot;Adore&quot; is a  lot more softer than their previous efforts or anything they'll probably  ever do. The Bauhaus influence is heavy, but not to the point of riping  them off. Lots of well placed gothic tinged effects (just like  &quot;Machina&quot;) that show off a side I'm praying they stick with. The  best songs are &quot;Ava Adore&quot;, &quot;Perfect&quot;,  &quot;Tear&quot;, &quot;Crestfallen&quot;, &quot;Apples &amp;  Oranges&quot;, &quot;Annie-Dog&quot; and &quot;Shame&quot;. All these songs  are beautiful but lyrically, they're perfect. I can say, without a doubt,  that this is Billy Corgan's best lyrical album so far. It's very personal  and touching. The only song that really makes use of guitars is &quot;Ava  Adore&quot;, the rest of the songs are a lot more slower, or when they use  guitars they are placed in a very delicate way, like &quot;Tear&quot;. From  the techno-ish &quot;Apples &amp; Oranges&quot; to the piano ballad of  &quot;Crestfallen&quot;, you really can't go wrong with this.This is the  sort of album you go to your room with, put it on, and just relax to.  Putting on your headphones and savoring it's brilliance is another way to  go, not standing on a chair and doing the air-guitar thing to, like their  earlier albums. I can see why older Pumpkin fans didn't really like this,  it's really different, less rock, more goth. It's the same reason I didn't  like &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, this is a completely different band. You  also have to undestand why I love this so much, my two favorite genres are  alternative and gothic music. So having an amazing alternative band making  an amazing goth-influenced record is what drew me to it. This and  &quot;Machina&quot; are my two favorites, check them both out to get a  surreal experience.
B000002KJL|5.0|The &quot;Dire Straits&quot; debut is my favorite musical recording ever. As a guitarist who considers Mark Knopfler my #1 influence, much of my own (limited) ability has been acquired playing along with this (relatively)  simple recording. Every song is at once accessible, interesting, and  engaging. I consider his finger-picking to be incredibly smooth and clean,  expressing a tremendous emotional range through variations in technique and  volume. Though (in my opinion) Mr. Knopfler's skill in playing (and  probably his songwriting) has developed through the years beyond the merit  of any single cut presented on the &quot;Dire Straits&quot; debut, perhaps  peaking (to date) with the wonderful &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;, his/the  band's first release will always be very special to me. After 22 years I  never grow tired of it. I was therefore moved by the glowing reviews of  others, nearly every respondent expressing sentiments that approach my own  feelings about this magical recording.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|Everyone says that Smash is &quot;sooooo much better&quot; but this one is a lot better. Beleive me because I got Americana first and then Smash because everyone said it was good. Everyone who reads this, get  Americana!
B00001R3GI|5.0|My experience with Exile was typical of many. Not many of the songs thrilled me at first (Rocks Off, Sweet Virginia, Happy being exceptions) and I thought this was another case of an average album being lauded as a  classic, ie Sgt. Pepper. However with repeated listening this evolved into  one of my top 5 Stones recordings, one of my top 10 of all time. My theory  on the appeal of Exile is this:  It is the Stones most honest and intimate  record. Jagger leaves his ironic poses and masks behind, and in my opinion  this creates his most soulful and heartfelt vocals. At times he  seems  angry, confused, desparate, sad, sentimental, and through the entire  record, human. The music perfectly supports and accentuates these moods,  every band member and supporting player in fine form (the horns in Rocks  Off are unbelievable). By 1971-72, the good vibes of the 60's were long  gone. Even though the Stones fleeted only briefly with the hippy dippy,  peace and love scene (I think Satanic Majesties was more a commercial than  artistic decision), they did seem to revel in the in the fun and excesses  of the times. I guess by this point things just weren't as fun and exciting  as before, and the jaded nature that really began with Sticky Fingers shows  itself in full force. The Stones were pushing 30 (which was old back then),  struggling with substance abuses, and like the rest of the rock world,  seemed to be at a loss as what to do next. It had yet to be established  that a rock band could continue on indefineitly so the future was uncertain  if not bleak. This is why the murkiness of the recording and difficulty in  understanding many of Jagger's lyrics works so well. It mirrors the context  in which Exile was recorded. I don't list Exile as my favorite Stones  recording because that depends on my mood. But when I want to feel like I  am listening to the &quot;real&quot; Stones, the Stones I can relate to,  this is what I put on.
B00000DMJF|4.0|Good album, some great stuff (Back in the U.S.S.R., Martha My Dear, Dear Prudence, etc.), and some completely wasted trite material (&quot;Why don't we do it in the road,&quot; etc.).<br />They should've let George Martin trim  this baby down. It's one thing to make an album, another thing to have all  your cute studio goof-off sessions recorded for the public.<br />The Beatles  get serious later on Abby Road, a much, much better album, which could be  their best. The top group of all time stumbles a bit on this one, but still  worthy of a purchase.<br />As for the morons on this board -- such as the guy  who said the Beatles were the Backstreet Boys of the 60's -- could you guys  please get real. Buy the BBC sessions, Pepper, Abbey Road and LISTEN. Read  some perspectives and quotes from other artists who were influenced by the  Beatles. Stupid statements like Beatles fans are like people who eat fast  food without questioning it -- that's completely dumb. Whether they like  the Beatles or not, give them their due.<br />I don't like Jimi Hendrix, but  I'm completely aware that he is awesome and I'll give him his due. Beatle  bashers on this board please get a clue in life.<br />As for The White Album,  it still puzzles me. I just think it needed some trimming down.

B000002KCV|4.0|When Neil Young decides to go mellow, he goes all the way.  He's been criticized for this, but when he does it right, it is very misically rewarding.  &quot;Harvest&quot; staked out this musical territory, and  &quot;Comes a Time,&quot; though not as popular, is a better album.  Highlights include &quot;Look Out For My Love,&quot; &quot;Human  Highway&quot; and the classic 70s ballad &quot;Lotta Love.&quot;  If you're  looking for heaps of guitar feedback, look elsewhere in the Young catalog.  However, if your tastes run to the lighter side of Young, this album is a  must buy.
B000020617|1.0|I bought this album in good faith after buying the other two FF cd's years ago. It opens with &quot;Stacked Actors&quot;, an extremely cool song, but from there, it's just a bunch of duplicating 80's Fleetwood Mac-esqe pop.  The truth? One song cannot save an album, and apparently, even Dave Grohl  can't save this one. And to the guy who said &quot;Down with Nirvana&quot;  or whatever, without Nirvana, we could still be listening to boring sludge  like There is Nothing Left to Lose.
B000002MZ9|2.0|Perhaps the most hotly anticipated rock pairing of the 1990s, &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; wallows in the mediocrity of most supergroups (including, I might add; Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young).  As a huge Young fan, it pains  me to say that this is the weakest of his 1990s recordings, the decade  which overall featured his revival as a major artist.  One wishes that  Pearl Jam had served as more than just a backing band for the record.  Maybe they could have contributed some better songs as Neil was not up to  his usual fine standards as a songwriter.
B00004SVID|5.0|I Recently Purchased this cd and it is great. All my favourite song and then some. This is a great item for any Floyd Lover.
0425170349|5.0|Tom Clancy gives so much detail in the story that you almost believe you are there. You can practically hear the gunshots, the orders, the helicopter overhead, etc. Tom Clancy puts you there and allows you to almost perfectly understand the life of a secret anti-terrorist group and  the life of terrorists.
6305627401|1.0|I think this movie had to much swearing. I'm geusing that about 50% of the words they say are swears. I used to like Them but I don't know why. I don't even know why I saw this stupid movie. The boy who smoked ciggaretts  said really bad things  about god. The first time I saw it, I thought that  it was funny, but now I realize that it is the biggest piece of gargage in  the world. So if you're into to toilet humor, you could buy it, but if  you're accualy a decent person, don't
0064407667|5.0|I thik this book was incrediblly good.  At parts It may have seemed a bit sad but usually right after it's happy again.  There are 4 characters which no one could not forget.  I was impressed by how the author displayed the characters feelings.  While you read you could really feel what was going  on.
6303589162|5.0|Brian De Palma's Body Double is an underrated gem of a suspense/thriller.  Released in the early 1980's, it was bashed for being too derivative of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window and Vertigo, plus being too sleazy at the  same time.  But in all honesty, I feel these aspects actually worked  together to make a truly tight, suspense-filled, edge of your seat  thriller.<br />Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is an actor who thinks he has it all  until he discovers he's been fired from his current work and his girlfriend  Carol (Barbara Crampton in a 5 second cameo) is sleeping with another man.   While looking for work, he encounters a guy named Sam Buchard (Gregg  Henry), another actor looking for work.  Sam, noticing how unhappy Jake is,  offers him the chance to sit a house that belongs to a friend of his.  Jake  gladly agrees for he has no home to go to.  After the first night in this  new home (it's actually a cool one too) he peeks through the telescope by  the window and sees the neighbor (Deborah Shelton) doing an erotic  striptease and masturbation dance.  This continuous observation leads  Scully to the world of pornography and a porn star named Holly Body  (Melanie Griffith), who may hold the answer to a crime he witnessed.<br />It  was late around midnight when I watched this film and I was feeling a bit  sleepy but Body Double kept me wide awake and in suspense for all of its 2  hour running time.  Honestly, I never expected this movie to be that good.   Primarily, the most important aspect is if the movie delivers suspense, and  that it does.  Extremely well, too, might I add.  Brian De Palma can be  thanked for this.  Who can forget the tunnel scene, the venture into the  mall, the crime Scully witnesses, and the really creepy climax.  Brian De  Palma is truly one of the modern masters of suspense and should direct more  films like this.   What makes the suspense work is mainly because of the  fact that Wasson is alone in his investigation.  It creates a strongforeboding atmosphere.  The great musical score doesn't hurt either.   Another asset are also some surprising and unpredictable plot twists that  occur.  I was surprised I didn't have it figured out toward a certain point  despite some good clues (and the fact that Wasson's character figures out  part of the mystery with the same amount of hints and clues as the viewer  has).  Watching the movie again is also fun just to re-examine the twists  and see how they worked out.<br />Yes, the film does have a countless amount  of nudity in it but it's actually vital to the movie.  After all, how would  Wasson's character witness the crime if he didn't have the proper  motivation to peep on his neighbor.  It's an interesting look at voyeurism  and how it affects a person.  Yes, some moments are a bit sleazy such as  when Wasson is watching the X-rated channel.  But I can cut that part some  slack since it is actually quite humorous and it also leads to another plot  twist.<br />Speaking of humor, that's another element that surprised me.  I  never expected it, but Body Double does have its humorous moments that  lighten up the tone a bit.  Some of its subtle while other parts are  actually quite hilarious (especially if you watch it with a friend),  especially De Palma's portrayal of X-rated films.  Don't think that the  humor hurts because it by no means meanders the suspense.  It just makes  the film more entertaining. <br />Acting wise, Body Double is quite good.   Craig Wasson is terrific as the everyday guy who gets caught up in some  events beyond his control.  Melanie Griffith is also fine as Holly Body  though her character wasn't quite developed well enough.  Deborah Shelton  is okay as the neighbor Wasson constanly peeps on.  She actually develops  into a likeable character despite the fact that you know what her fate is  early on in the film.  Look for Dennis Franz as an independent horror film  director.<br />In the erotic thriller genre, Body Double certainlyranks at  the top.  It feels genuinely suspenseful and it never manipulates the  viewer like so many other films of the genre do.  And as a sidenote, watch  the movie at midnight for the full effect, just like I did.  It'll make the  scenes at night with the Indian a whole lot creepier.
6305750750|5.0|just a few more things...  Girls, you will find this movie breathtaking, if of course you are as sane as I.  U will find it breathtaking because of Ewan McGregor, the cute actor who plays  Obi-Wan in Ep I.  The lightsaber  duals were fantastic! <br />BYE BYE
0790729628|3.0|This is one of my favorite movies, but I expected more from this dvd. There is almost nothing as far as special features go, and I prefer the original version. The directors cut lacks harrison ford's narration, which  really helped to set the mood in the original. Still, few movies are as  unique and visually satisfying.
6305750750|5.0|A maximum of 5 stars...  You gotta be kiddin me.  I would rate this as 99999 repeated%.  In othe rwords, the best possible anything.  From diverse plot to the surprise ending to even the wonderful (and cute) actors, this  movie beats all that is possible.  Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson make  stnning performances, as well as Ray Park and Natalie Portman.  All the  other actors did great too.  I won't give away the surprise ending, but it  had me in tears.  I also liked the surprise identity thing too, although I  knew from the moment the chage occured that something was amiss.  Anyways,  this movie is what caused me to meet my future husband... Obi-Wan!   Thnx  bunches Ewan and Lucas!  and everyone else too! <br />From Obi-Wan's  faithful wife,<br />Aur Revoir
B00000J7RZ|5.0|Jennifer Lopezs cd is very good because she has given us a lot of variation, It's not that serious is a good song so dynamic, the album fuses  both R'n B and Latin music so it is very good, also there is a lot of  songs on this album unlike other artists. i guarantee this cd to anybody  who like Puff Daddy and latin arists.
0767802659|1.0|This movie barely resembled the story told by Heinlein.  It twisted the politics of the story into the worst sort of propoganda.  It undermined all the relevant technical details (using hand-held nuclear weapons without any  sort of personal protection? Wow...).  I saw this movie expecting some  modifications in an effort to make a good movie and &quot;update&quot; it.  What I saw was Verhoeven's personal agenda projected into what should have  been a really great story.<br />So many important details of the story were  changed that it undermined most of the emotional impact of Rico and why he  did the things he did.  In the book I found myself liking and identifying  with Rico.  In the movie I found myself frequently wanting to slap him and  tell him to stop being stupid.<br />Don't waste your money.  Give it a miss.  Read the original book and check out any of the really great Sci-Fi films  that are out there.<br />Interestingly, I've discovered an animated series for  children also based on the book.  Production values are clearly lower than  this movie and yet the series manages to be at once more entertaining and  truer to the original story.
6305165912|5.0|Just rent this film once and you will want to buy it forever.Simply put the best performances ever by Jeff Briges and John Goodman and nonstop comic dialouge makes for simply one of the funniest movies around.
B00003CWPR|5.0|The people who gave this one or two stars don't know the first thing about cinema. They should stick to Batman.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|This is my favorite cd.  It has many different feelings from sad (Two Beds and a Cofee Machine) to outgoing (Chained to You).  It is a must have.  The only thing I didn't like was that some of the last songs are slightly  boring. But I still love it!
B000000OTU|5.0|This is the first Aerosmith CD I got. All these songs are awesome. If I could add one song to this album it would be &quot;Walk This Way&quot; but oh well. But anyway, all these songs are great, especially Janie's Got a  Gun, Crazy, and Cryin'. This is a great CD, that all Aerosmith fans should  have.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Critics are falling all over themselves to praise this album.  But for some reason, many long-time Elliott fans have many less than kind things to say about Figure 8.  I consider myself a relatively long time fan of  Elliott (I have all five of his albums), and I think I understand why many  feel that this album is below par (although I steadfastly disagree with  them as you'll realize by the end of this review).  The first time I heard  Figure 8, I thought it was great, but a great album for Elliott would, for  me, be on the bottom of a list of exemplary albums that he has previously  released.  I loved the production though, and I knew if I gave it a chance  I would love it equally as much if not more so than his other albums.  I  think this production that drew me closer to it, repelled many Elliott  fans.  People who adore Roman Candle and the s/t (of which I am one) may  think this is &quot;overproduced&quot; and as a result, not as passionate.   I am here to tell you why that is not true and why, track by track this may  be Elliott's finest album to date.<br />1. Son of Sam - Fabulous, the piano  gets me going every time (boy can Elliott play that thing).  The melody is  great (as usual) and have you ever enjoyed hearing about a serial killer so  much?<br />2. Somebody That I Used to Know - Very early Elliott, and the one  that people who don't like this album generally name this track as their  favorite.  Terrific, Elliott and a guitar and a great vertical melody.   <br />3.  Junk Bond Trader - OK, it took me a while to get into this one, I  don't know why, it's a great track.  I love the keyboard at the intro, and  the bells throughout the track.  Very Elliott lyrics (even though I don't  know them all yet).  I love the guitar as well.<br />4. Everything Reminds Me  of Her - very Passionate song with passionate vocals, great shimmering  guitar work.  Terrific lyrics.  You can almost see the sun on the steeple.   Beautiful.<br />5. Everything Means Nothing ToMe - Perhaps my favorite on the  album, perhaps my favorite Elliott song period.  Imagine Brian Wilson  during Surf's Up, and there's the opening melody.  Absolutely gorgeous  piano and vivid, heart-breaking words.  I cannot say enough good things  about this song to do it justice so I will move on.<br />6. L.A. - Perhaps the  first Elliott song ever that can be described as &quot;fun&quot;.  This  song has lots of musical ideas in it.  Very very catchy, great harmonies,  great words.  Another one of my favorites.  And he saves it all with  &quot;last night I was about to throw it all away.&quot;<br />7. In the Lost  and Found (Honkey Bach) - another candidate for favorite track on the  album.  Very McCartney-esqu piano lick, with soaring harmonies.   Mind-numbing (in a great way) bridge.  Makes you want to repeat it, but you  want to go on to the next tracks even worse.<br />8. Stupidity Tries - OK, so  I had heard the live version of this about a million times before getting  it on Figure 8, but it still rocks.  Great chromatic melody, great lyrics,  and I love the changes in dynamics. Fab.<br />9. Easy Way Out - Possibly the  most gorgeous melody on figure 8.  Soaring melody, absolutely biting  lyrics, and a great arrangement with an instument I can't quite  identify.<br />10. Wouldn't Mama Be Proud - Another one that took me a while  to get into.  But well worth the wait, fan-freakin'-tastic harmonies.   Great lyrics.  The instrumental reminds me a little of With a Little Luck  (in a good way).<br />11. Color Bars - Great, great, great, fabulous piano,  great words, and strig section that really adds.<br />12. Happiness - Have to  admit, that I'm still getting into this one.  I think it's because I had  heard it a couple times before the album came out (broke my own rule) and  that kind of ruined it for me.  Still, I know it's a great song, I sure  thought so before Figure 8 came out.<br />13. Pretty Mary K - another  contender for favorite.  Probably the bestharmonies on the album.  Great  production.  I love the lyrics too.  Great track.<br />14.  I Better Be Quiet  Now - Great Melody, I just like this one a ton.  A song you can really  relate to.<br />15. Can't Make a Sound - Reminds me a little of Oh Well Okay,  turned into a mini pop symphony.  Love it.  Another one of the best.  Great  semi - album closer.  Takes the place of Everybody Cares Everybody  Understands (which I also love).<br />16. Bye - I can't even listen to this  track without feeling a little uneasy.  I mean that in a good way.  I  really wish I could play piano that well.  Fabulous way to end an album.   <br />Well, there you have it.  My very long winded review of Figure 8.  I  leave the album in a sense of awe (that may just be my fascination with  &quot;bye&quot; but I don't think so).  Please, please check this album out  if you haven't already.  If you have it and have already taken it off your  rotation list, please put it back on and give it another chance.  It is al  miraculous album, truly Elliott is a work of art in progress and I hope he  continues to be that way.  If he does, every album he every puts out will  be well worth owning.
B000002BE9|5.0|I've had this CD for a couple years now, and it's still one of my all time favorite CD's. Fiona has one of the best voices in the music industry. Every song on here is wonderful. The song &quot;Never is a Promise&quot;  brought tears to my eyes (yes, I know that sounds very corny, but true)  when I first heard it. Every song is unique in it's own way. Fiona is quite  an indvidual and her music is amazing, there's just no other way to put it!
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknots cd is the best.Their secret song&quot;Eyore&quot; is pretty  good.In my point of view surfacing and spit it out are the best  songs.Sid(the dj) does an awsome job in spit it out. the only song I heard  about was Wait and Bleed before I got this cd but now I like all of the  songs expect 742617000027.Corey taylor does  exellent singing.The slipknot  home video is great, the best part in it is the spit it out video that is  based on the horror movie The Shinning.Its good and now i know why itwas  banded for MTV.But like i said  the cd is great buy it .
0783241569|1.0|i really waa excited about seeing a romantic comedy and it was just a disapointment. the story was kinda dragged out until near the end and then eveything became so sudden and happened in the last 15-20 minutes of the  movie. the &quot;budding&quot; romance between Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant  to me was not real...it just didn't seem touching.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This cd is awesome if you only like one song just buy it and listen to it .I can bet you that when your done you like more then one song.Other artists that are good are Korn,System of a down,powerman 5000,and some of you might like Marilyn Manson.He's pretty good.But Slipknot is the best
B00000JWVO|5.0|This was a great movie for anyone...the whole family will love it.  I saw this with my father and some family friends and loved it.  Elaine Paige was great singing 'Memories'...it made me cry it was so sweet and realistic.  This is a 5 star and if you haven't seen it you should.
B00001IVOR|5.0|This is the best Hip-Hop album ever made, period. The Wu got it going on. Let me clarify a couple terms for you. Hip-Hop is East coast (where I'm from) and Rap is West coast. Hip-Hop concentrates more on lyrical expertise  combined with good background instrumentals. Rap, on the other hand,  concentrates more on good [foreground] instrumentals and, yes, slower  lyrics and rhyming. Now, both forms to me are excellent. BUT, I lean more  toward my native lyrical style, Hip-Hop, which was invented in my  birthplace, NYC, in the streets of The Bronx, whereas I am from Queens. Of  course, we all know that the Wu-Tang Clan is from the streets (actually,  the projects and the streets) of Staten Island, which is a less famous and  much less populated borough of NYC.      'Wu-Tang Forever' was virtually  created with a certain style: lyrics,instrumentals, and overall feel, that  was intended to make it the best Hip-Hop album of all time. Just listen to  this supreme Hip-Hop album and you'll see what I mean. It's totally  mindblowing! You'll bump your head to this one (that is, if you like Rap  and Hip-Hop music) and the double album will enrapture and encapture you  from beginning to end OF BOTH ALBUMS. This is a MUST-HAVE for any Hip-Hop  fan. Wu-Tang Forever and NYC Forever!
0812548094|5.0|this book is the perfect sequel to Wizard`s First Rule. And if W.F.R. was an exelent book, you can imagine how S.O.T. will be. I am a big fan of terry goodkind`s novels, and read w.f.r. by coincidence, now thanks to that  accident I discovered some great novels. I respect the decision of those  who say that these novels are too violent, all I have to tell them is  `great novels as these are not for everyone. I also like the saga wheel of  Time and Tolkien`s novels. Terry rules.
B000002UV9|5.0|This is one of Queensryche's best and most instrumental albums to date. Almost all the songs on this great album revolve around urban themes. A great example of this is the lyrics for &quot;Jet City Woman&quot;,  &quot;Empire&quot;, and &quot;Della Brown&quot;. Very urban and city  like.....sounds and lyrics. The guitars and instrumentals on this album are  some of the most varied on any Queensryche album to date. One more thing, I  truly believe that if you don't like any of Queensryche's albums after  'Operation: Mindcrime', you're not a real, true, Queensryche fan. Now,  please everybody, understand what Queensryche is trying to say to the  masses about what life is all about (as in &quot;Anybody Listening?&quot;)  and LISTEN AND UNDERSTAND!
0380796090|5.0|A lot of people are comparing this book to Bridget Jones and I don't really see the similarity except for the fact that some part of it takes place in London (a very SMALL part).  I loved the first Bridget Jones, thought the second was OK, but this book easily tops both.  Although, in my  opinion, they are NOT similar.<br />I am an avid reader and average a book a  week.  This is one of my favorite books of all time and I read it all in  one sitting.  The storyline was interesting, the writing captivating, funny  and fresh.  Although it is easy to get frustrated with the main character,  it is easy to sympathize with her.<br />This is NOT another of the many  &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; copycats out there.  This tale is truly unique!
B000021XR5|4.0|offering a peek into the minds of STP, &quot;No.4&quot; assures us that at least they're still together and alive!  Being a STP fan, from WAY back, I found this album less than entertaining...don't get me wrong, it has some  great songs on it like &quot;Down&quot; and &quot;Sour Girl&quot; - but  they seem too manufactured... always priding themselves as being the  outsiders of the incrowd, STP has settled.  They haven't gone anywhere with  this album.  Musically, they stopped their progression at &quot;Tiny  Music...&quot;  and this album is just another stunted example of how  caffeine will kill ya...I love this band, but this album is not up to THEIR  standards.  According to marketing and pop music, they're right on.  It's a  good album, just not a good STP album...if that makes sense.
B000002NBY|5.0|I have had this cd for about 4 years, and it is still my favorite, and most listened to of all.  This is a must buy for anyone who likes &quot;real&quot; music.  I wish i could give it more than 5 stars.
0783225792|5.0|This has got to be the best gangster film yet. DeNiro and Pesci are both awesome!
630575067X|1.0|The VHS is OKAY (saw it on the monitor at my local video store).  It suffers the usual drawbacks of a VHS tape (occasional video signal distortions etc.) I refuse to purchase this video because by doing so it  just prolongs the DVD release of the Phantom Menace and for that matter the  original trilogy.  George... how much money can you possibly make for a  single film? Star Wars (on video), Star Wars Wide Screen Edition, Star Wars  (on Laser disc), Star Wars the special edition, ALL the sequels and in all  formats.  Plus you WILL I'm sure release eventually Star Wars on DVD as a  tv format release, wide screen release, special edition (tv format) special  edition wide screen etc. etc. etc. Give us a break.  Thought of making  another film OTHER than Star Wars?  On second thought...don't.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I first heard this on Roswell( of course) and I thought  it was pretty good.  One of my friends got the cd.  I heard it, and fell in love with it.  You don't get the full song on the intro to Roswell, but it is really  great.  I was totally blown away.  I love all the songs and I listen to the  cd all the time.  I can't wait for another realease!
B00000J7J4|5.0|on my opinion that's the best cd of the year!  i hear it 24 hours a day and i never get tired of it. great music by a great artist!
0694009792|5.0|I am six years old and I love Goodnight Moon - it's my favoritebook! My cousin's birthday is soon and he's turning one - I'm gettinghim this!  I think this book is good for anybody who loves MargaretWise Brown's books.  The bunny is cute and I have the doll that goes with the book. So enjoy Goodnight Moon if you ever buy this book. Your kids will enjoy it!
156895557X|5.0|I loved this book! It really made me think about what was important in my life and about how many of life's lessons I've learned and have yet to learn. I enjoyed this book so much, I have purchased the audio cassettes  for my father who is 50 years old living in a nursing home, struggling to  overcome the effects of a severe head injury. I hope it is as inspiring to  him and other resident of the nursing home as it was to me.
B000002J1M|5.0|This is the one that really got them on the map, and got Peter on the  cover of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wearing a fox's head.  That says a lot,  really; much early Genesis is like a bizarre fantasy world, and that is a  big part of its allure.  You're supposed to sit back and let the music move  you...I love the review of the &quot;music fan from L.A.&quot; who  introduced his nephew and his little friends to this album--there is  something wonderfully magical and fun about early Gabriel-era Genesis that  kids should love, and adults too.<br />Besides all the mystical stuff, there  are also some pretty damn good songs here!  The first chords of  &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; were their trademark in the early days,  and they'd always open the show with it...a powerful piece of music that  never ceases to send chills down my spine.<br />&quot;Time Table&quot; serves  the purpose of a &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; really...to settle things  down a bit.  It's pretty average, but quite listenable.  &quot;Get 'Em Out  By Friday&quot; is a fun song that tells the story of a family being kicked  out of their home by some big real estate developer (okay, it doesn't sound  fun, but trust me)...&quot;Can-utility&quot; ends the first side...another  underrated piece that has its moments.<br />And before we brush right past  &quot;Horizons&quot; to get to &quot;Supper's Ready,&quot; let me just say  that the former is a beautiful acustic song.  The latter is the cornerstone  of not only this album, but of early Genesis as a whole.  I can't even  describe it, really...you just have to hear it for yourself, but sufficed  to say, it is a progressive rock masterpiece.  The best part for me is  passing from the dark and forboding (and excellent) &quot;Apocolypse&quot;  into the hope and optimism of &quot;As Sure as Eggs is Eggs.&quot;   &quot;Foxtrot&quot; and &quot;Nursury Cryme&quot; are classic albums,  surpassed only by &quot;Selling England,&quot; &quot;The Lamb,&quot; and&quot;Trick of the Tail.&quot;
B000021XS0|5.0|If there are STILL people out there who think awards shows are real/genuine/respectable then do yourself a favour, be brave and buy this album, and change that (mis)conception. The fact that 'Scenes' won no  awards is not surprising, most of us are used to it...in a perfect world  Dream Theater would have walked off with every award catagorically  possible. <br />The album is in one word brilliant. Note : for something to be  brilliant, it does not need to be original, only exceptional yet still true  and honest to the artist, and in the same measure original doesn't mean  brilliant.<br />The fact that Dream Theater can make an album like this, an  album that no other artists can come close to, is by understatement,  commendable. <br />The negative reviews sadden me, not because I think they  are being unfair, but because I feel they are missing out. I wish you could  experience this in the same way that I do...with profound delight.
B000002J1L|5.0|This is the first Genesis album with the &quot;classic&quot; lineup, which include newcomers Steve Hackett on guitar and Phil Collins on drums.  The addition of these two great musicians makes the album far better than both  its predecessors, and marks the beginning of the golden era of Genesis  which lasts through 1977; five more LP's and two live albums.<br />Not  everything here is essential, which is really why Cryme deserves 4 1/2  stars instead of 5, but there's enough excellent material here to satisfy  any fan.  &quot;The Musical Box&quot; is an astonishing piece of music, the  drama of which the band perhaps never quite topped.  It begins with 12  string guitars delicately accompanying Peter on vocals, and eventually  builds and builds to a fantastic climax...and then is followed by the soft  and subtle &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; with a then mousey-voiced Phil on  vocals.  &quot;Giant Hogweed&quot; is a rocking song with some wordy vocals  that also builds to quite a climax--probably the loudest the band ever  got.<br />The second side isn't quite as consistent...&quot;Seven Stones&quot;  is a solemn song which includes one of Tony's first recorded uses of the  mellotron...&quot;Harold the Barrel&quot; is laughable, forgettable fun,  and &quot;Harlequin&quot; is a rather fruity ballad.  Nursury Cryme ends  with a bang, however, in the form of &quot;Fountain of Salmacis,&quot; a  very wonderful and underrated Genesis song that tells some obscure story of  mythological figures (you know these Prog guys), but manages to be rather  moving at times.  Really only &quot;Selling Enland,&quot; &quot;The  Lamb,&quot; and &quot;Trick of the Tail&quot; are better than Nursury  Cryme, and &quot;Foxtrot&quot; is just as good.
6305169187|2.0|I wasn't able to suspend my disbelief during this movie. Nor did I care about the characters. Impressive special effects. That was the only thing that impressed me about this movie. They should have let the asteroid  destroy the earth and put us all out of our misery if this is the type of  film we are left to watch.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|THis CD features &quot;Feelin' So Good&quot; FEATURING BIG PUN and FAT JOE. It Is Not The Radio Edit, It Is the full version.
0440234743|5.0|This book is a MUST for a movie! A &quot;thriller&quot; till the end.  Kept my interest on every page.  Loved the detailed explaination of the travels through the jungle; Loved the compassion for those who give their  lives to serve their God; loved the compassion for the children who are  reared by a self sustaining, &quot;greed-for-money-and power&quot; man who  puts self first and forgets his family. (That is the criminal part of the  book.) Loved the determination we saw in the lead character to give up his  vices and become a survivor, and that he did.  Loved the passionate ending  where he recognized a Godly person who sent a spirit to him who recognized  the goodness in a once broken man. Only a God loving person sees the  goodness in others beneath their dispair, regardless of religious beliefs.  Beautifully written, held my interest throughout, read it in 3 days,  couldn't put it down. It can truly become a new testament for those who  allow themselves to read between the lines and recognize their past  failures, without it becoming a &quot;preached-to&quot; lesson.  For those  who feel they have been &quot;preached-to&quot; really didn't read the book  to it's fullest. A great quick and enjoyable read.
B000002UBU|1.0|I first listened to &quot;Vincent&quot; on a bus in Van Gogh territory in the Netherlands in April '00. I liked the song, especially the lyrics, and the voice wasn't half bad. I came back home and bought the album, played  it, found the voice not quite as fetching, the other songs pedestrian. I  still like &quot;Vincent&quot; but would NOT recommend this album.
6305263248|5.0|Unlike some of the other people that reviewed this movie, I found that it does a great job creating a sort of &quot;Chinese Box&quot; to make for a great mysterious movie.  Yes, there IS a good plot and many underscores  that leave the viewer guessing right up to the very end.  DeNiro uses  simple strategies with his technologies to give a sort of 60s James Bond  feel.  This movie takes &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; a step further by  giving you a more involved plot that isn't obvious.  This is an intelligent  movie, not the muck that action movies have been taking to in the 90s.  A  definite must see...
B000023VR6|5.0|DR. Dre has now proven what many already knew; that is that he is the undisputed king of rap.  He created gangster rap, and transformed all of rap with the original chronic.  Whats more, he is an outstanding producer.   Now to the album.  The Chronic 2001 is better than the masterpiece  &quot;Chronic&quot;.  With songs like &quot;the watcher&quot;, &quot;still  dre&quot; &quot;whats the difference between you and me&quot;, and  &quot;forgot about dre&quot;, it is hard to top.  Also, he adresses some  older issues like his beef with easy e, and his relationship with snoop  dogg.  Overall, an almost perfect album, and a must have.
B000001U3K|4.0|after looking at the track listing i thought this album was Lou Reed's greatest hits.. . it might as well be. every song is gold, but what else would you expect when bowie and lou reed get together
B000002WAD|2.0|&quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; is one of the best light-pop dance singles of the 1980s. &quot;Together Forever&quot; musically is OK, but the lyrics are incredibly trite, even by the admittedly low standards for this  type of music. The rest of this album is not even worth mentioning. Astley  has an above-average voice, but he can't salvage the weak material he's  saddled with here. Get the singles off of Napster or tape them off the  radio and ignore the rest of this.
B000001FY9|5.0|I'm not the biggest Reggae fan in the world.  The only reggae CD's I own is this one and a couple other of Marleys (Kaya, &amp; Rastaman, which mysteriously has NO songs on this compilation).  But all I can say is that  every song on this collection is spectacular.  The version of No Woman, No  Cry is very intense, just to name one of the highlights.  If you can only  own one reggae CD, then this is definitely the one!
B0000046KM|5.0|Simply put, the best jazz vocalist recording of the last 20 years.  I've purchased numerous copies to give to people whose musical and aesthetic sensibilities I trust.  If depression comes from the inability to find in  nature beauty commensurate with that in the human psyche, this album is  guaranteed to administer a cure.  The choice of songs, the re-visioning of  each song, the piano accompaniments of Horn herself, the trumpet work of  Wynton Marsalis (who filled in at the last minute after Miles' untimely  death), the transcendent arrangements of Johnny Mandel, and the sublime  readings of Ms. Horn cannot account for this &quot;miracle&quot; of a  recording whose meaning is far greater than the sum of the parts.  Not  since late Bill Evans have I heard anything this beautiful on record.  It  fact, it would be hard to leave it off of any list of five best jazz  recordings ever.
630575067X|5.0|If you like action and adventure you will love this movie!  Jar-jar- Binks is real funny but not very smart. I think you like this movie alot
6305076626|3.0|I love the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I loved it before I knew that it played in midnight theaters, I loved it as a movie before I loved it as an experience.  I bought the regular edition on video as soon as I could, and  when I found out about the &quot;special edition&quot; I pounced on  it.<br />Unfortunately, it's not a very &quot;special&quot; edition at all.   The original ending with Superheroes is a treat, but it's AFTER the closing  credits in a seperate section.  Why not put it where it was originally, so  you don't have to watch the end of the movie, fast forward, and watch the  end of the movie again?  Boneheaded move on 20th Century's part.<br />The  other deleted scene, &quot;Once in Awhile,&quot; was deleted for obvious  reasons.  It's a great song, but there's only about 5 seconds of new  footage, and the rest is a montage of scenes from the rest of the movie.   If you've got any of the Rocky Horror CDs, you've already heard the song,  so it's no big thrill to have not-quite-matching visuals with it. <br />If you  don't already own any video edition of Rocky Horror, this one's as good as  any.  But for a die-hard fan looking for a &quot;special edition,&quot;  this just doesn't cut it.
0671042858|5.0|I think King did an amazing job describing the scare of being lost in the woods. This book totally drew me in from the first chapter.  I could not put this book down. It captivated me and made me keep reading just to see if the girl survived. His descriptive details and feelings of a nine year  old lost in the woods was outstanding. I love King's books and this one  just added to his spark that he possess when he writes. He is truly a  masterpiece writer. Thanks for writing such a real and intense novel.
B000002H6C|5.0|The has got to be one of the greatest cds ever. This is like the only cd I listen strait through. Every song rocks expecially Blackened, Justice, One, TO live is to die, and eye of the beholder. Now everyone always complains  about how the production is bad. The only problem is hearing  the vocals  but otherwise it's fine<br />P.S Ever notcie how the slow song is #4  Sanitarium, One, Fade to Black. And the song the album is named after is  number 2. Lightning, Puppets, justice
6303201962|5.0|Considered the best Star Trek film to date.  The film is a virtual Horatio Hornblower in outer space.  Wrath Of Khan is a gripping adventure reminisent of a 1957 WWII film &quot;The Enemy Below.&quot;  Ricardo  Montalban is superb at Khan Noonan Singh, genetically modified super madman  from the late 20th century.  Awoken on a sleeper ship in the 23rd century  by Capt Kirk and crew, only to be exiled on unstable planet.  Khan seeks  revenge on Kirk in the worst way, as he hijacks a Federation starship as  well as a device that could literally destroy the galaxy.    The best line  in the film:<br />Admiral James T. Kirk: Khan, you bloodsucker! You're gonna  have to do your own dirty work now, do you hear me? Do you? Khan: Kirk!  You're still alive, old friend! Admiral James T. Kirk: Still, &quot;old  friend!&quot; You've managed to kill everyone else but like a poor  marksman, you keep missing the target. Khan: Perhaps I no longer need to  try, Admiral. [beams the Genesis device away] Admiral James T. Kirk:  Khan... Khan, you've got Genesis, but you don't have me. You were going to  kill me, Khan. You're gonna have to come down here. You're gonna have to  come down here. Khan: I've done far worse than kill you, Admiral. I've hurt  you. And I wish to go on hurting you. I shall leave you as you left me, as  you left her: marooned for all eternity in the center of a dead planet,  buried alive. Buried alive. Kirk: KHAAANNNN! KHAAANNNN!<br />Wrath Of Khan  also stars Kristie Alley (of Cheers, and Veronica's Closet).  It was  Krisitie's 1st roll on the big screen, playing Lt. Saavik, Spock's  protegee.   Great acting by Montalban and terrific over-acting by Shatner.    Star Trek II is a tour de force.  A must have for the Trekkie and sci-fi  collector.
0783235968|5.0|This truly is one of the best movies of all time.  Why?<br />Because it brought in a whole new perspective on baseball,<br />with a lot of care, blended in a story that touches us all---<br />whether we ever picked up a glove or \\"had a catch\\" in our life.<br />That is the story of a man who drew away from his father, further and further, and never had a chance to reconcile before dad died.  In this movie, he gets another chance, and in our lives, each of us, we all get another chance to start again, and remember, and follow our dreams.<br />My wife Chris and I live in the farthest north city in the U.S. ---Barrow, Alaska, and virtually every summer we travel over 3000 miles to go to Dyersville, Iowa, to the great town it is---and also out to the field.  We meet people from all over the world, who keep coming, way after the movie has come and gone.  We all talk about baseball, and our dads, and sometimes how great the corn looks all around the outfield.<br />Give this movie a try, if you've missed it all these years.  Relax with some loved ones, and maybe your old baseball or softball glove, and check it out together.<br />I'll bet you won't be disappointed. In fact, as some reviewers have noted, it may change your life.\\"<br />Go the distance!!!!!!!!!!<br />Earl
B00000253N|5.0|Often in conversation, people will ask: &quot;If you could take one album to a deserted island, which would you pick?&quot;  I pause for about 2 seconds before replying: &quot;Blood on the Tracks.&quot;  This was the  first Dylan album I ever owned and it remains not only my favorite Dylan  album, but my favorite album, period.<br />&quot;Blood&quot; is like a  journey.  From the minute you hear the opening guitar of &quot;Tangled up  in Blue&quot; to the wonder years feeling you get from &quot;Buckets of  Rain,&quot; Dylan has you hooked.  There is not one weak, or out of place  song on this disc.  The journey takes us from the heartwrenching  &quot;Idiot Wind,&quot; perhaps one of the most brutally honest Dylan songs  ever written, to the touching &quot;If you see her say hello,&quot; and  doesn't let us catch our breath until it's over.  My personal favorite:  &quot;You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go.&quot;  The words and the  melody are so simple, but they get me right in the heart every time I hear  the song.<br />When people ask me what the best Dylan &quot;starter  album&quot; is, I always give them a copy of Blood on the Tracks.  If you  don't love this cd, chances are you're never going to love Dylan.  He's  never sounded better and he's never written more honest music.  Great  albums have come before and after, but never have they sounded quite like  this.
B000001FTQ|5.0|I understand how people don't like the fact that &quot;Wide Awake in America&quot; is only four songs. I personally think it is well worth it, if just to get the most impassioned live version of &quot;Bad&quot;  available (all live versions of &quot;Bad&quot; are better than the  studio). I swear I stop breathing every time I hear the song.
0684872153|1.0|After just having finished McCourt's novel, I'm wondering - quite baffled - at what the fuss is about.  This book is neither interesting, engaging, or well-developed.  None of the characters gain sympathy or have any redeeming qualities.  Worst of all, the ending leaves you wondering why you  spent time reading the first 458 pages, since there is no closure (or even  a suggestion thereof) as to the fate of the characters.  I realize there is  a sequel, but a memoir should offer some sort of clincher to the story,  otherwise, the meaning is lost.<br />Also, when by some miracle the author  touches upon an interesting memory, he wraps it up within two or three  paragraphs, leaving you to re-read the paragraphs in order to escape the  onslaught of drivel to come.  It reads like a series of  snapshots.<br />Instead, _Angela's Ashes_ reads like a laundry list of deaths  by consumption and breakfasts of fried bread and tea.  Repeated  descriptions of chamber pots, lavatories, and oozing orifices made me feel  so ill that I had to gag up my own lunch. I only forced myself to finish it  because I paid enough for the paperback.  All in all, I'm disappointed and  stunned that anyone could hail this piece of garbage a classic.  Not I.  Save your money - _Angela's Ashes_ seems to be written with a stilted hand  that is anxious to follow in the path of traditional Irish tales of filth  and poverty.<br />Sadly, it doesn't even live up to the worst of the lot.
B000002A3T|5.0|I will be brief.  This beautifully presented musical statement deals with the topic of &quot;separation&quot; - separation from society; from people we want to love and who want to love us, but can't; from nature; from our  selves; and ultimately from our dreams and aspirations.  It is as heart  rending as it is alluring.  Those who know the difference between loss and  alienation will probably find this among their favorite pieces.  Please  remember to let the work play from start to finish without interuption at  fairly high volume to receive the full effect.  Discover it for yourself.
B00000JPH5|5.0|I've been watching this movie since I was ten years old, forcing my dad to spend hundreds of dollars renting it, until buying two copies this past Christmas.<br />_Labyrinth_ is pure magic: the puppets are unreal, quirky,  and hilarious.  Hoggle and Ludo bring tears to my eyes, Ambrocious makes me  laugh out loud, and the Goblin King scares me.  Of course, Sarah was and is  my hero of adventures.  It is so easy to get involved in this film, to  suspend your disbelief, and start to imagine life beyond the Goblin City,  fate ticking away to the hands of a thirteen-hour clock.<br />This is what a  film should do, transport us from the mundane in to such colours and planes  of the human spirit.  This is definitely a movie I will pass on to my  future children.<br />Yes, I'm rambling, but it's harder than nails to  describe this movie in a paragraph or two.  I feel giddy just thinking  about it.  Watch it once and you'll never &quot;turn back&quot; ;)<br />Also  recommended: Anne of Green Gables and The Princess Bride.
B00003CWN3|2.0|First, find a depressing, controversial topic.  Add in a boring, overly-dramatic script.  Throw in a cast of completely unlikable characters devoid of any redeeming qualities.  Mix thoroughly and add a tragic end and  you have a favorite of movie critics everywhere.  Unfortunately, you also  have a long, boring movie that will thrill film school students and  deep-thinkers, but will leave those who watch movies for entertainment with  nothing more than two wasted hours.<br />This film is not all bad.  The  performances by the cast are excellent.  Hilary Swank does a fantastic job  as Brandon Teena, and clearly deserved the Oscar.  The supporting cast also  does admirable work.  But, that work is portraying characters that viewers  cannot connect or relate to in any way.  The story of Brandon Teena is  worth telling, but it is best told by a documentary, not by a movie meant  to entertain.<br />If you like movies with a serious, important message and  very little entertainment value, see this movie.  If you watch movies for  entertainment, avoid this movie at all costs.  Despite the fine  performances, when I finished this DVD, I wanted my two hours back.  It is  a depressing, long, boring movie that only a critic could love.
B000007OY0|5.0|I have seen this movie innumerous times..it is fascinating. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman provide for the perfect contrast. It is a movie about perseverance, tenacity, dedication and true and unwavering friendship. A  beautiful story! I cheered each time I saw it...
B000005ALP|5.0|Words cannot describe how incredible this album is, but I'll try.  First of all, this is easily one of my favorite 10 albums of all time.  I can't get the songs out of my head... the music is so catchy, AND the lyrics are  so intelligent and piercing!  E experiments with a few different styles  here, from harder stuff like Mental to funk like Guest List, to more  depressing slow stuff like Manchild.  My favorites are Not Ready Yet,  Flower, Guest List, Your Lucky Day in Hell, and Manchild.  However, it's  ALL great stuff.  The only low points for me are Mental and Spunky, but  that's only because they're not INCREDIBLE like the rest of the songs...  they're still very good by normal standards though!  My only warning would  be that this album is VERY depressing... by the time the last notes of  Manchild (a real downer of a song, but an appropriate last track) have  faded, I'm often in tears.   But it's so worth it!  Buy this  album!
B000026258|5.0|This is the one!  One of ten or so pieces that changed my life (in the way of listening and influences, along with &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, &quot;Take Five,&quot; Webern en masse, and &quot;Don't Eat the Yellow  Snow&quot; (seriously!)).  I even had the pleasure of meeting Steve Reich a  few years ago after a concert, asking him to autograph my copy of this  disc, and thanking him for writing this (he greatly appreciated it).  How  this piece changed my life was that it got me listening to music in yet  another way (hitting me similarly like Stravinsky, Brubeck, Webern, and  Zappa, amongst a host of others).  I came across this piece (via LP) almost  nine years ago (as of this writing), and I can say without exaggeration  that I have been listening to this at least once a week since then.  What  is it about this piece that often sends me into such a passionate frenzy?   To be honest I really cannot say, perhaps it was the timing, a setting, I  cannot tell.  What I do know though is that this is still by far the best  recording of &quot;18&quot; that I have heard (not to take away from the  other two that have followed; they are just as marvelous) and it still  sounds fresh to my ears as it did then and will still many weeks from now  (as of this reading).
B00003CWPR|5.0|I know alot of people didn't like this film when they first saw it, I didn't eather.  But when the DVD came out i rented it just to give it another chance.  The first time through i found it odd, overly ridden with  sex and sluggish pacing made a bad movie.  But the second time around it  was a whole different experience.  It made a hell of alot more sense and  was at times haunting to watch.  If you are one of the people who didn't  like it the first time through see it again I'm sure you'll like it much  more.  You may find a respect for the filming and the story that you may  not have had, I know i did.  Just watching Kubrick's steady-cam work is  breath taking.  I do have to say that Kidman did a pour job in this film,  her drunk and high scenes were a little more than comical to watch.  I've  always loved Kubrick's work and the first time i saw this film i was  dissapointed that this was how he left the world but the second time  through it has become one of my alltime favorite films ( and I have seen  alot).  I encourage people to take another look at this film it may change  your mind.  Sadly though the DVD left in the CG figures in the orgy scene  and stand out due to a pour mat job but that is the only down side to the  film.
015626224X|5.0|What happens when you are living in a foreign city and your money runs out? It seems obvious that George Orwell the writer and George Orwell the down-and-out are two different people. After all, one had considerably more resources than the other, including a somewhat wider knowledge of society  than your average clochard. However, regardless of whether it was for the  sake of a writer's experience, George Orwell did survive the gruelling  experience of working near the bottom of the Parisian hotel/restaurant  trade as a plongeur. Most of us would have caught the first train home with  funds stolen or otherwise procured in a jiffy. <br />Naturally, working down  in the airless depths of a hotel meant meeting many odd bods that were  otherwise out of Orwell's orbit and this is part of the delight of this  excursion into the subterranean world of the servant classes. The book was  written in the 30s, at a time when European society was about to undergo  the transformations caused by its second bloodletting in three decades.  Orwell takes us back to a period when men sweated freely at their work, in  almost impossible conditions, and considered themselves to be among those  who were better off! It makes one wonder today that road gangs (the workers  were called \\"navvies\\" in Britain) used to do all the work by hand, which is  now done by enormous machines with a little group of workers standing  around looking, waiting to tidy up. Backbreaking work is a thing of the  past for most of us, but it lingers on in the memory of our grandfathers  and comes to life in Orwell's fine text about a forgotten lifestyle of  yesteryear.  <br />His further excursion into the shelters for the homeless in  England is also of interest. There was a way of life, of people always on  the move, occasionally finding seasonal work, (represented by the hobo in  America and the swaggy in Australia), which was well known to many people  but was, even then, coming to an end. Interesting portraits ofan age from  a writer who led a far from sheltered life himself.
B00000IO4J|3.0|this movie was kind of scary but mostly science fiction.good for fans of both of those kind of movies
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad has changed the way that I have looked at my personal spending habits and how I will invest in the future.  I especially likes how the book does not shove a product down your throat but stresses that educating yourself is your number one asset.  My wife and I were in the  process of planning to add on to our house but after reading the book we  decided against and determined we don't need more room to clutter.  Since  reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad,  I have met with my broker and have been  studing real estate investments ( which is a strong interest of mine).  I  highly recommend this book and his second book &quot; The Cashflow  Quadrant&quot; to anyone who wants to get a boost to a successful future.
6302649943|4.0|this movie wasnt too scary,but i still loved it.it has to be one of stephen king's best movie.most movies that are 3 hours long just have too many boring parts.this one didnt have any boring scenes
0312853238|5.0|I rate this book on a scale of one to ten a 1,000!  It is my second faveorite book in the world because of all the action.  You should buy it and or read it.  I liked it because it keeps you reading with its action packed suspense.  I liked it because it is science fiction.  Also, it is  very interesting.  The basic plot is a kid that goes to a battle school and  becomes the stongest general ever at the age of 11.
B0000026J6|5.0|I'm not going to go thru this whole album. All I can really say is this man has to be one of the greatest songwriters of all time (another being Elvis Costello). He has a voice that was not meant for singing but that's  what makes it great. i'd take this man's voice over any other singers out  there. you will not be disappointed if you purchase this album. songs like  &quot;first we take Manhattan&quot; and &quot;tower of song&quot;...WHO  ELSE COULD WRITE SUCH GREAT LYRICS/POETRY ? he is truly a genius and this  album is just spectacular. enjoy. and personally in reply to everyone's  comments, i think &quot;jazz police&quot; is a fun song where Leonard just  wanted to 'let his hair down'.
B00000JTB2|5.0|This album cannot lack in the collection of people fond of blues, or of good music in general. It captures an exciting and hot concert between two great artists that are unfortunately dead, but this work represents the  best epitaph for them. The quality of the recording is very good and A.  King and S.R. Vaughn are supported by a first- class band. Also the  excerpts of conversations reported in the CD are very amusing. I love all  the songs of this album but my preferred ones are \\"Stormy Monday\\", \\"Pride  and Joy\\" (the sole track sung by Vaughan). and \\"Ask Me No Questions\\".
6305657947|2.0|I don't quite understand the rave reviews this film received.  It certainly doesn't work as real drama (granted it's not intended as such), as the plot elements are far too ludicrous.  Anyone with some knowledge of  art and the art world will be in danger of losing their eyeballs in the  back of their heads - from rolling them so much.  And as escapist fantasy -  the plot twists and gimmicks are rather predictable, and when they are not  predictable it's only because of the astounding ludicrousness.  Frankly,  for escapist fun the unabashedly over-the-top Bond flicks are much  better.<br />Maybe good for a rental - I certainly don't recommend buying it.
6305363668|5.0|To tell you the truth , i had never heard of this movie till i saw it for the first time a couple of days back(18 years after its release! ). I was gripped by the movie as soon as it started and was completely satisfied at  the time it ended. This could be one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever  seen . <br />After seeing the movie, I have done some reading about it and i  gather that the director's cut has excluded the explanatory narrative and  the happy ending of the original and added the unicorn scene into it . Each  of these alterations seem to have been done for the good . I did not think  any explanation was required although the story is not immideately obvious  but then thats what intellegent viewing is all about . The director leaves  clues along the movie which the viewer needs to pick up . <br />The unicorn  scene is the highlight of the movie. Only for a few seconds, the scene  holds the key to the identity of the the hero. <br />I strongly recommend this  film to all lovers of the futuristic noir genre .
6305524866|4.0|This movie features memorable comic vignettes and great insights into relationships, love and fear of commitment. The mumbling Hugh Grant delivers an effortlessly charming performance, he is rapidly becoming the  British Cary Grant. Also extremely good supporting cast. Unfortunately  Andie MacDowell doesn't add enough life to her important character and  makes 'Carrie' almost lifeless and dull, which is the exact opposite of  Kristin Scott Thomas performance which is quiet but right on the money. The  whole movie is ultimately entertaining, fun and very funny at times. The  ending is out of place and doesn't seem as smart as the rest of the film.  From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!
B000001ED1|5.0|Christmas time is a time when gifts fly like birds, and no one knows what to get anyone. There's the inevitable question of &quot;what do you want for Christmas&quot;, always catching you when you're off gaurd. It came  through, as one evening in the car, my aunt asked the questioned. At a loss  of ideas, I said &quot;Ya know that song Dr. Evil and mini-me sing in  AP2?&quot; Singing the chorus line, she remembered, and no one in the car  knew who the artist was. Christmas came, and flurries of gifts fell. I got  into some hot water with my parents, at the family get-together, and slunk  away upstairs, deciding to try the CD.<br />Wow<br />The album had me intrigued  and I thought about how great it was. Ofcourse, many other gifts were  flashier than the CD with 12 old men on the back. It got more and more  plays, until my love for it bloomed like a flower, and I played it all  thetime. The tracks are all deep and meaningful, and comfort you. Whenever  I wanna hear something good, guess what CD goes in?<br />Many CDs I have are  played all the time, then fall. This CD, is the strongest, longest-lasing  of them all.<br />There is no doubt in my mind of what your next but should  be.
B000002AP1|3.0|It's doubtful there were any women on the remastering crew. That's our loss -- they might have tempered Iggy's over-amped testosterone level. I can't listen to it at more than 2 or 3 volume (not what Iggy intended, I'm  sure). But the most painful thing - more painful than the distortion - is  the finality of the ruination of a masterpiece. This is it folks. A great  opportunity was lost.
B00000K19E|4.0|I love the visual effect in this movie
B00003CXDV|5.0|HILARIOUS is the word to describe this affectionate and fun-poking spoof of all those old cheesy sci-fi shows like the early STAR TREK(especially), BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and so on. This movie succeeds with geek sci-fi where  MYSTERY MEN failed with its lame spoof of comic strip heroes. Tim Allen,  Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman(he's funny with his deadpan and miserable  manner as he was in DOGMA) et al play the cast of a sci-fi series(of the  film's title) who are reduced to appearing at Trekkie-geek conventions  where kids nit-pick at technical errors in the series and dress up like  their favourite characters(the Klingons in the toilet scene is a real  hoot). So what happens when a group of real aliens who think their TV  exploits will help them win an interstellar war want them to play their  roles for real? Watch and I guarantee you'lll laugh yourself silly! This  movie is obsessively intent with never letting a laugh get away. Often  similar to, but much better than, Mel Brooks's SPACEBALLS, which was made  some time back.
0964385619|4.0|In college I studied biology and psychology.  I have no background in business and/or investing.  I have developed an incurable interest in learning about this facet of life though.  I found this book very  enjoyable.  Although what the author has to offer the reader is not rocket  science...deep down I think we all know everything that he has to say  BUT...the book is a fabulous summary.  It provides easy and entertaining  reading.  It serves well as a &quot;pep rally&quot; to get yourself in line  for a beginning in investments.  Although I am sure I will never be the  multimillionaire that the author is, it is refreshing to be reminded that  we all have the potential and being ready for an opportunity is what makes  the difference.  Live within your means and invest a little bit at a time.
6304259093|4.0|Good screenplay, great cinematography. Yes, The Crow was a good movie, yes, a sequel won't be as good, but City of Angels does a great job. Those who complain about the similarity (face paint, crow symbols) have missed  something-THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THE SAME THEME AS THE CROW. Tying the  first movie into the second one via Sarah was an interesting idea. Although  it loses some momentum at the very end, it is still enjoyable. If you want  to complain about a travesty of The Crow, see The Crow:Stairway to Heaven.  After watching that, you won't complain about this one.
6305171769|3.0|I have never been a huge fan of the HALLOWEEN-Saga. Part 1 absolutely sucks and does not deserve to be called a classic. Part 2 is brutal, but also very boring. Part 3 does not belong in that series anyway, but Part 4  is quite OK. Parts 5 and 6 are totally disappointing, and it is a shame  that HALLOWEEN 6 happened to be the very last movie to star the great actor  Donald Pleasence. Part 7 HALLOWEEN H20 is watchable, but only because Steve  Miner was the director. Miner did a great job by making FRIDAY THE 13TH  Parts 2 and 3. At the end of HALLOWEEN H20 we get to see a decapitated  Michael Myers. I hope that this is the end of Michael and HALLOWEEN. I  think the Jason-flicks are ten times more entertaining than the  HALLOWEEN-movies, while Pinhead from HELLRAISER is ten times more scary  than Michael Myers. Dear horror movie fans, if You want to see an  atmospheric and dark slasher movie, than go and rent FRIDAY THE 13TH Part 4  - THE FINAL CHAPTER. That is a real cool and creepy film.
6305784116|5.0|I'm so glad that Disney made this film.  I much prefer the more innocent Disney movies of the past.  Movies like Lady and the Tramp and The Aristocats are truly fun, wholesome entertainment.  Don't get me started on  the new Disney films which are way too interested in pushing hit pop songs  and attracting adults with more action, violence, and suggestive dialogue.   I know things can't stay the same so I'm glad we have this film from a more  innocent era.  I particularly like the fact that the pacing is relaxed and  the villain is not very scary.  I'm always looking for what I call  &quot;calm&quot; movies and videos for my 2 and a half year old.  I don't  want him seeing frightening or fast-paced images.  Lady and the Tramp and  Emmet Otter's Jug Band Christmas are other great shows for young viewers.   Unlike the sterile environment of the Teletubbies, these movies are full of  wonderful images and interesting music.  I find the backdrop drawings  extremely interesting and stylized.  I also like the setting of the film  (France) as opposed to the mainly exotic locations lately of Disney films.
0780622553|5.0|Firstly - this is not similar to The Matrix. The Matrix is similar to Dark City, something that most people seem to forget. The film itself is brilliant with a story that will blow you away. Just don' t miss it. Or  miss it and run to the nearest cinema to watch it in 20 years time, when it  will be considered a classic.
0671042858|5.0|I loved this book!  An easy and fast read.  I really felt for this poor little girl lost in the woods and also lost in the depths of her own mind.  Highly recommended book!

B000023VR6|5.0|he really rocks even my parents like him is it just me or dose everybody think he rules
B00000FZQ8|5.0|Is it just me or sci fi movies were better when there were less special effects resources? A strong plot moves with a nice pace that unfolds as you watch, making you think about the possibility of a world without nature.  Beautifully photographed, the movie retains that 70's Sci Fi quality (2001,  Star Wars:ANH) in it's production design and effects. Great perfomance by  Bruce Dern completes the scene to make Silent Running a true Sci Fi  Classic.
B00003CXDV|5.0|I was having a really down day when some of my friends suggested they take me to some movie called Galaxy Quest. In less then two hours I walked out cheerful, laughing and transformed.<br />This is the type of movie that is a  real pick me up. Within minutes you are laughing out loud (especially if  you have even vague familiarity to Star Trek.) The concept of out of work  science fiction series actors being mistaken by aliens as the real McCoy is  brilliant. Tim Allen and Alan Rickman pull off this farce brilliantly. Even  crazed Star Trek fans are portrayed lovingly.<br />This is a must own Movie, I  have preordered the DVD
B000001FV9|4.0|I have to respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer's low opinion of the live side of this album.  Although the Fillmore West recording is pretty low-fi, the two extended pieces are among my favorite Steve Winwood  keyboard workouts and are best heard on a hot summer night.  This is the  closest Winwood came in Traffic to his blues work in the Spencer Davis  Group.  The studio pieces are all old favorites, although they feel like  outtakes from the first two albums.  This album is cobbled together, but it  presents two appealing aspects of Traffic.
B000007T1M|5.0|I usually can't stand &quot;Rap-metal&quot;, i prefer stuff like Death and Iced Earth, but when my friend loaned me a copy of this, my opinion was changed a little. Unlike your typical rap metal band, they actually have  something to say, and some cool riffs to back that up with. Its not  extraordinarily technical or anything, but its cool anyway. The best tracks  are War, Suite Pee, Sugar, and P.L.U.C.K.
6305807086|5.0|This movie rules!  It has everything...<br />A director. (Spike Jonze) A cast. (A lot of people) A crew. (Even more people) A background. (Inside John Malkovich)<br />It has good comedy, and ideas.<br />Just the idea of going  inside somebody and looking through them is awesome! <br />Get this movie!
B000000XCH|5.0|30 years ago, when this album came out, it was all over FM radio.  Every cut was analyzed and then some, proving what a true classic this is.  No matter how many anthologies and greatest hits albums of CCR's on the  market, THIS IS THE ONE album to own.  Just put it on, sit back with your  favorite beverage and enjoy it over &amp; over again.  Highly recommended  for fans of truly great rock &amp; roll.
B00000FBRE|5.0|I thought that this cd was one of the best cd's i have ever heard! I especially love &quot;gun in your hand&quot; that is like my favorite song. I think that Lagwagon is a very good punk rock band who makes great music  and all of their cd's are good but i this one is by far the best!
0679746048|4.0|&quot;Girl.....&quot; was good, although I must say the movie was 10 times better. Susanna analyzes herself a bit too much in the book.  I guess seeing the movie first was a mistake!   I expected the book to be the  same.  Some of the parts were similar but others made no sense.  I  especially was messed up because the movie was filmed where I live in Pa.   It was hard to imagine our State Hospital as her hospital in Mass.  All in  all, it was a good book.  Just read this BEFORE watching the movie!
B000002UCQ|5.0|The many reviews already say it all. Almost every track belongs in a &quot;best of&quot; collection. &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;What Is Life&quot; were great radio hits all those years ago. However, it's the  other music on the album that sets the deeper and darker tone. The mood is  serious and introspective. &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is a song that  you never want to end. The lyrics and arrangements pull you inward.  &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot; is also hypnotic (actually the whole album is).  The pain in the lyrics is equally present in the music and voice. &quot;I'd  Have You Anytime&quot;, &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;, and &quot;Beware Of  Darkness&quot; haven't lost any of their significance thirty years later.  Some of these tracks made their way on &quot;The Conert For Bangla  Desh&quot; album, which was his other &quot;great&quot; album and  contribution to the early 70's. &quot;Beware Of Darkness&quot; is probably  the best cut on that live album. Lennon's &quot;Platic Ono Band&quot; and  &quot;Imagine&quot; albums are the other great post-Beatle albums.  &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; catches the pain of the Beatles' break-up  better than any other solo effort. McCartney's &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot;  speaks of the confusion and pain but is limited to this one single, which I  think was McCartney's best and most honest post-Beatle release. &quot;All  Things Must Pass&quot; and &quot;The Concert For Bangla Desh&quot; are two  of rock n' roll's great efforts. Honest, poignant, relevant, and great  music!
B00001ZUGJ|5.0|The Matrix is one of the most brilliant, mind-blowing, heart-stopping sci-fi movies of all time.  The special effects, sound, and action sequences are so spectacular that they move you and absorb you all at once.   The four Oscars this movie won for special effects, sound editing, and  other technical achievements were well deserved. This movie will take your  breath away and stimulate the facets of your mind to twist in ways you've  never imagined. What happens when Neo takes the red pill and tumbles down  the rabbit hole? Watch this film and you won't be disappointed.
1572522232|5.0|How can you hate this movie? It's without a doubt one of my favorite movies. If you don't like this movie then you must be too dense because it's just so much fun. No, it's not exactly scary, but not all movies have  to be scary to be good. The style that the director uses is so cool. All  the colors and the wierd camera angles. Plus the music is awsome! It's not  the least bit boring and it keeps you guessing until the end. Joan Bennet  is really creepy in this movie! Jessica Harper is also fantastic.
0446364495|2.0|Watch The Movie instead. I must say though that I really appreciated this book when I was younger and more starry-eyed. I love the premise, though I feel the writing could have been more lush and poetic.<br />The movie is more heartbreaking.
B00004S361|5.0|This album is unbelivable. I got it two weeks ago and cannot stop listening to it. Stevie Wonder never ceases to amaze me with his talent.
B00000JHAU|5.0|The spotty &quot;Boy with the Arab Strap&quot; was a major letdown mainly because the excellence of this, its predecessor, set such a high standard for this band. If you haven't heard Belle &amp; Sebastian, be warned that  if fey, heavily Scottish singing isn't your cup of tea, it'll turn you off  the way Morrissey's voice made a lot of people dislike the Smiths even if  they enjoyed the music. This album has B&amp;S' most incisive, funny  lyrics, pastoral arrangements (the Vince Guaraldi-esque &quot;Seeing Other  People&quot; is a particular standout), and sharpest songwriting. The only  clunker in the bunch, in my opinion, is the wheezy &quot;The Boy Done Wrong  Again.&quot; One of the best British indie releases of the past few years.
0784011206|5.0|I got this DVD as a buy one, get one free offer from Artisan, and my expectations were pretty low.  I was pleasantly surprised to find such great menus and features on it.  For instance, the scene selections menu  contains not only full motion video, but also sound from specific scenes!   I have never scene this before on a DVD, not even a Criterion DVD.  I loved  the menu transitions with the flying bowie knife.  The DVD is also  jam-packed with all the extras you would normally find on Criterion or  the  New Line Platinum series.  I enjoyed the commentary by the author of the  book and was fascinated at the differences between the film and the book.   I believe that this is one of the most underrated DVD's out there and it  has quickly become one of my favorites in my collection.
B00000J7J4|2.0|Honestly, I always admired Carlos Santana's work. He is a talented musician who can really play guitar well and for that alone I'll give him an extra star. Although he always features some vocals on his albums they  usually blended well with the music and like the music itself they retained  their latin flavor. Not to mention his instrumental tunes were always  infected with such deep sensuality and mystery.<br />However on this album,  Carlos must have reached into a hat and randomly picked out several pop  artists from each style of music to feature on this album. The last people  I would have ever wanted to hear on a cd like this are Dave Mathews, Rob  Thomas and Lauryn Hill. And I'm sorry but Santana needs to stay away from  Wyclef about as much as Sting needs to stay away from Puff Daddy! Rap and  Santana just don't mix, and neither does trendy &quot;college&quot; bands  and Santana either. <br />Album of the year and a bag full of Grammies doesn't  mean anything in my book. They'll give a grammy to anyone radio programmers  chose to play that year. <br />Santana's music has lost all of its sensuality  and atmosphere with this album and for true sensual latin influenced music  I'd much more reccommend music by B-Tribe instead which sound like a cross  between the OLD Santana instrumental works, Gypsy Kings and early  Enigma.<br />If there's one thing I cant' stand it's sell-outs, but for the  money I guess almost anyone will do it.
B000002O96|2.0|This '60s blues summit was a chaotic disappointment. It's interesting as blues history more than as blues music (the female chorus is particularly annoying). Look for some prime Muddy and Wolf instead.
B00004SVIK|5.0|I have been a Floyd extremist for years, and trust me- this is a must-have for any Floyd fan. The booklets included are very helpful in giving you a better idea of what the concert was actually like.  I kick myself for never  seeing Floyd live, but having this cd makes it a little better.
630575067X|3.0|I was 5 years old when &quot;A New Hope&quot; was premiered, and I (of course) was completely swept away by the fantasy of George Lucas's far-off galaxy. I was too young to be a discriminating viewer. Today, I can see the  original trilogy's shortcomings, and they're similar to the flaws of  &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; (dumb dialogue, less-than-rounded-out  characters). The difference was that from 1977-1983, I didn't notice or  care, and this nostalgic filter through which I watch the original trilogy  is what insulates it from critcism. No such filter exists for &quot;Phantom  Menace,&quot; and an older, more jaded person is likely to carp on its  shortcomings, especially after all the hype and anticipation. Here are the  weaknesses of &quot;Phantom Menace,&quot; as I see them: 1. Jake Lloyd; 2.  Jar Jar Binks; 3. stiff delivery of dialogue (that's the director's fault);  4. Anakin yelling, &quot;Yippee!&quot; (what kid says that?); 5. the lack  of an assertive yet funny character (like Han Solo). But the biggest reason  I even care about these things is because I'm too old and jaded now to  appreciate &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; for what it is (beneath the glittery,  sci-fi exterior, an old-fashioned Western movie), and be able to view it a  sense of childlike wonder and awe. I guess that's my problem. I still look  forward to Episodes II and III though, believe you me.
B00003CWPR|1.0|How could anyone make a boring movie involving murder and sex? Well, Stanley Kubrick has! This film trudges along at such a slow pace that even the most devote film enthusiast will be fighting to stay awake. At 2 1/2  hours, the film is vastly overlong and this is evident from the first scene  that involves a party that never seems to end. The acting is okay although  Nicole Kidman's character is annoying. Fortunately, her scenes are minimal.  Photography and set decoration is excellent with rich saturated colors and  impressive houses and decor. This is the film's only redeeming quality. The  whole feel of the film can be summarized by Nicole Kidman's final line.  Stanley Kubrick has made some of our most memorable films and it is sad  that this had to be his swan song. And how wasteful that the actors  involved in took so much time out of their lives. Truly one of the worst  films I have seen in a while.
0767802519|5.0|Definitely one of the best movies ever! The director did a great job at making you feel what Leon (the hitman) and Mathilda (little girl who Leon is protecting) are feeling.  Lots of action and suspense while still  showing the relationship between Leon and Mathilda.  I recommend that you  see this movie sometime  in your life!  You won't regret it!
B000000W74|3.0|There's nice stuff here, but most of these songs are retreads of numbers he's done much better on superior albums much earlier in his career. DO NOT MAKE ANY HOOKER RELEASED AFTER 1980 YOUR FIRST PURCHASE (or second, or  third, or fourth, or fifth, or..) Earlier Hooker is much, much better.  Trust me.
0671027344|5.0|I have never cried as hard as i did when i read this book. What charlie goes through, the things he sees and the things he feels, it all paralleled my life on so many levels. I openly wept for the first time ever from a book and it felt so good. For once, an author has gotten it right. Everything inside of me was written here.<br />Charlie goes through so much.  He really changes, metamorphosises and takes everyone he touches with him.  This book has a magic about it that i will always be grateful for. After i  read it, i gave a copy to all my closest friends and hoped they'd  understand me better for having read it. So many of them hadn't understood  my emotions until they read it. The way chbosky writes it, you can feel the  characters breathing. This book has changed my life.
B000002KCC|5.0|I am a huge Neil Young fan and this album, along with UNPLUGGED, is my favorite.  Every song is wonderful.  You should definitely buy it...NOW.
6300215741|5.0|What a fantastic movie! Very suspenseful and beginning-to-end thrill and excitement throughout. Stars 2 of the world's most famous actors for the silver screen; the legendary Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. I honestly think  this is Princess Grace's best film, and never was she more beautiful and  stunning. They both should have won Oscar's for this movie. Now, this film  met all of Hitchcock's usual standards, and, in my opinion, was just as  good as the other 1959 Masterpiece, North By Northwest, which you will  absolutely LOVE if you loved this one. Trust me, this movie is well worth  buying on tape; however, it does air on T.V. often, so catch it then. I  Love Grace Kelly!
B000002J1S|5.0|Yes, this is as absolutely as rich a piece of rock music as one could imagine -- in part because it is so lacking in the flaws that afflict other such &quot;epics.&quot;  Nearly every song is lovingly worked.  Nearly  every song explores a deep groove in Gabriel's disturbing existential  vision.  Maybe a few songs could not stand on their own, but listen to this  album all the way through (it's not hard) and you will feel fingers  tightening on your throat, caressing more and more of your face, until the  end expels you back into the real world sweating and breathless.  By the  way, I saw the tour...
B000001EAQ|3.0|&quot;Pop&quot; beats out &quot;Zooropo&quot; by a nose as worst U2 album, but it's still not bad. &quot;Discotheque&quot; is something they never should have tried, &quot;Miami&quot; and &quot;The Playboy Mansion&quot;  aren't very good. Still, there are about four really fine songs here. When  U2 goes for songs over &quot;cool&quot; style they're still quite good.
B00000J6AG|5.0|How often do u find an intelligent and articulate artist who mixes spirituality and electronic music successfully. Not often, but here's MOBY whose artistry brings you a range of music influences from electronic to  gospel to trip-hop all rolled into one excellent CD! All these being done  without the preachiness!  Check out his catalog of oh-so-excellent CDs.  NOT JUST THIS ONE!
B00000JCB2|5.0|WUZ UP HOMMIES!  This track by Limp Bizkut is off the hook! Fred Durst be phat,yo! Theres some killer cuts on here.  I get off on CRANKIN this tape when I be jettin in my lo rider, pickin up chickens, yo!   Make sure you  check out KORN, and KID ROCKtoo. They be tha BOMB!
B000005JA8|5.0|All I can say is that this totally demented Captain Beefheart is a genious! While others unsucessfully try to sculpt &quot;perfect&quot; masterpieces Beefheart farts masterpieces out without a second thought.  Chances are if you play this album for someone they'll either laugh in your  face or run like hell, but there's so much soul and depth. The voice  talents of Beefheart is true to all great blues traditions, just listen to  &quot;The Dust Blows Forward and the Dust Blows Back&quot;, &quot;China  Pig&quot;, or &quot;Well&quot; you might mistake it for some  pre-rock  blues great. Other songs like &quot;Moonlight On Vermont&quot; are chaotic  and streaming. This music will transdend you.
0812589041|5.0|The story is interesting from the start.  The way Card makes you feel sorry for the kid. But when the IF Captain shows up the story grips you to the end.  Card make the BattleSchool so real you feel like you can feel the  sloping of the floors yourself.  I strongly recomend anyone going out and  buying this book and the rest of the series.
B000001G53|5.0|One of the most successful Karajan's recordings, with a superb cast who really devote themselves into the depth and drama of this sublime and at times enigmatic music. I have to say that after hearing this recording,  Wagner's music can be really beautiful and even with a spirital quality to  it. THh Good Friday music is a real beauty and the dark and dramatic Act II  is brought out with utmost power. thanks to stunning singing by Vejovic. A  must for all Wagnerians and perhaps adventurous opera fans.
0393317552|4.0|As I read it, this book argues that modern imbalances of power between human societies can ultimately be traced to accidents of geography which determined the possibilities for the development of plant and animal  domestication, state societies, and culturally stimulating inter-societal  contacts such as long-distance trade.  <br />Whatever one thinks of that  overall thesis, the book does offer much to the reader, both general and  specialist, in the way of revelations of unexpected facts.  The author  integrates much of the latest work on genetics, agricultural history,  cultural anthropology, linguistics, archaeology, and other fields and  introduces them to the general reader as well as to the over-specialized  academic.  <br />The thesis functions well as far as it can go.  The danger is  that, in accepting the book's thesis, the uncritical reader might simply  replace &quot;racialist&quot; or &quot;culturalist&quot; explanations for  the disparate &quot;fates of human societies&quot; with an excessively  &quot;geographical determinist&quot; one.  <br />I find convincing overall  Diamond's arguments as to why human societies in different continents  (&quot;Eurasia[plus North Africa],&quot; &quot;[Sub-Saharan] Africa,&quot;  &quot;New Guinea,&quot; &quot;Australia,&quot; and &quot;North/South  America) developed differently.  He is right to stress the link between the  environmental preconditions for the development of human societies, as well  as to highlight that epidemic pathogens are as integral to the package of  &quot;civilization&quot; as writing, bureaucracy, or high technology and  that they are part of the &quot;advantage&quot; which ensured the victory  of Eurasian over American, Australian, and certain Oceanic peoples (the  last ultimately products of Eurasia and yet through isolation losing the  advantages of that heritage).<br />However, the thesis can only go so far,  particularly when we consider the imbalances of power between the  &quot;Eurasian&quot; societies themselves, which ordinarily command more of  the attention of the general reader than the deposition of an Inca emperor  or, unfortunately, the dispossession of contemporary Amazonian  tribespeople.<br />After spending more than a whole chapter on enumerating the  geographical advantages enjoyed by China, Diamond comes up against the  problem of China's current subordination to the West.  On the one hand,  China seems to embody in miniature the geographical virtues of Eurasia as a  whole -- a variety of highly productive areas with easy access to each  other.  On the other hand, by facilitating early and sustained political  unification, this particular geography appears, to Diamond as to the  geographical determinists from whom he inherits the argument, to have  precluded the inter-state competition which promoted technological  innovation in Western Europe, whose geography prevents easy unification.   <br />If we consider more closely the &quot;conundrum&quot; of why China did  not discover Europe when it had treasure fleets of gargantuan junks  reaching as far as East Africa in the 15th century, we see that  geographical determinism loses its explanatory power at this level of  analysis.  <br />Diamond, like many Westerners, assumes that &quot;voyages of  discovery&quot; are self-evident goods in themselves which will be embarked  upon if only the machinations of bureaucracies do not stifle them.   Or  perhaps that a regional multi-state system will in itself encourage such  ventures.  <br />These both miss the point about European expansionism.  Here  the question is not of opportunity (and preconditions) but of motive.   <br />The Chinese and other non-Western European Eurasian peoples had no  compelling desire to discover the farthest ends of Europe (and needless to  say, therefore availed themselves of no chance of stumbling into the  Americas), because, among &quot;civilized&quot; areas, Western Europe was  marginal to the world economy which was centered in the manufacturing and  agricultural powerhouses of China and India and the spiceries of Indonesia.   <br />The next less marginal area consisted of the Islamic heartlands of the  Middle East (though still far more advanced than Western Europe) which had  long reached out towards the wealth of those eastern lands through both  conquest, trade, and missionizing in a way which partly foreshadows later  European behavior.  European expansionism can only be understood in the  wider context of the evolving world system and not in terms of its internal  dynamics, much less its &quot;unique characteristics.&quot; (If we want to  talk about the last, we can posit that Western Europe's uniquely combative  and competitive stance towards a neighboring -- and fraternal --   civilization, that of Islam, was also a motivating factor in the former's  expansionism).<br />The above is not meant to detract from my generally  positive appraisal of the book, only to point out the limits beyond which  its thesis can no longer be profitably applied.  <br />It is unfortunate that  Diamond did not take on the IQ-counting, neo-racialists head on, only  shooting out provocative statements like &quot;Individual Stone-Age Papuans  are smarter on average than individual Internet-Age Americans.&quot;  I  personally do not see anything implausible about such a contention.  After  all, a person who has no calculator at hand when he solves mathematical  problems is likely to be better able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide  on his own than someone who always has recourse to such a  brain-supplementing, brain-substituting device.  A population which has  never invented eyeglasses will likely have on average better native  eyesight than one in which everyone uses eyeglasses and where natural  selection can no longer penalize shortsightedness.  <br />These examples just  remind us that such things as &quot;intelligence&quot; are as much  culturally determined as they are biologically.  If a non-modernized Papuan  with his particular cultural background made up an intelligence test and  administered it to an American, it is likely that the American would not do  as well on it as a fellow Papuan.  If the &quot;Jews&quot; as a group are  &quot;smarter&quot; than other populations, than that is less a sign of  inherent genetic superiority than on millennial processes of social (and  not strictly natural) selection for the particularly narrow economic niche  into which most societies have  ghettoized the Jews.  <br />Though it falls  short of explaining everything in the last 13,000 years, &quot;Guns, Germs,  and Steel&quot; does provide us a useful long-term, global perspective from  which to reconsider our most pressing questions of inter-societal and  intra-societal imbalances of power.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I was skeptical when I got this CD, but was very happy about it afterwards. I loved every song on this CD; my personal favorite is Dysentary Gary. I recommend Enema of the State to everyone. Their songs are  all very good, and don't have any phoney garbage. A good rock band that's  not too dark, blink-182 is a favorite of mine.
0812589041|5.0|Having a good grasp on SF books I have to say this is the best book I have ever read. The book starts off with a little kid being picked on.  This child is the basis for the book.  Aliens called buggers have attacked twice  almost killing the entire human race. Children particpate in mock battles  to see who can save humankind.  The book is absolutly gripping all the way  through. I strongly recomend buying this book at your local book store.
B00000JMQC|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when i saw probably 5 or 6. I'm now 20, and I still love this movie! It's a nice contrast from the original too: the once stable Dorothy now sees a therapist for her obsession with Oz, the once  beautiful Emerald City is now in ruins, and there are new friends and  villians too. This movie keeps you wondering what is going to happen next,  and where Dorothy is going to end up. Fairuza Balk, in her debut, does a  great job playing her. People who loved her work in The Craft will love  seeing her in this film!
B00000ILDE|5.0|As an owner of the &quot;original&quot; VHS version, I was a little hesitent to buy the 10th Anniversary Edition DVD - but I'm glad I bought it!<br />First off, the extra footage is actually good and really makes the  movie better in most cases! This isn't cheesy, grainy stuff like at the end  of Austin Powers - the scenes really help build the story - things like  seeing the colonists alive and interacting, showing how the colony was  infected, and going into why Ripley attached to Newt so much, really helped  make the movie that much better.<br />The other benefit of the DVD is the  magnificent color! Many dramatic scenes are cast in a red or orange glow  (ie: heat-lamps, red-alerts, etc..) and the clarity and sharpness is  absolutely amazing.<br />And how can I forget the &quot;still-shots&quot;? The  disc has behind the scenes still-shots of the models used, sketches, etc...  It's actually quite facinating to see how they created the colony, the  ships, etc..
B0000042H4|5.0|This recording of the RING brings this incredible work to life through a realistic and true reading of the score mixed with a  tremendous amount of musicianship. <br />The solists are stunning, and the choral work in  Gotterdammerung is superb. Solti works so well with this orchestra, and  this is my favorite recording of this incredible and vast work. I have  listened many, many times. One never tires through repeated listenings.  What an orchestra! What a conductor! What a soloists! A brilliant and  stunning recording!

B00004SVID|5.0|Terrific!  The Wall heard the way it should be... Don't get me wrong I won't be throwing my studio version out anytime soon but to hear the ENTIRE Wall soundtrack with both Roger and Dave is incredibly fresh. Will be in  the top 10 very soon.. Not bad for 20 year old songs..
0061020710|4.0|Pratchett is a wonderful writer.  He develops characters that are heros despite themselves.  Rincewind is downright human in nature and not the least afraid to show it. I loved the line, &quot;I've faced DEATH many  times, or rather HE has seen the back of my head as I ran the other  way.&quot;  So refreshing to see a bumbling, fumbling accidental hero!  I  loved it, am hooked and I don't regret it!  Oh, and who will ever look at  someone draging their luggage along behind the same way again?
B00003CXDV|5.0|This has to be the best parody of Star Trek (and all the other 60/70's space shows) ever. I am a big Star Trek fan and can see the funny side having been to many ST Cons. It not only has a good poke at the shows but  also the fanz. It has a great cast, a comedy routine to rival Abbot &amp;  Costello and unlike a lot of other spoofs has its own sub plot as well. It  is a must see for all Star Trek and Sci Fi fans alike.
B000002LRX|5.0|This album is one of my all time faves.  How good is this thing?  Fnm couldn't even top it or come close to it again.  This record is definately not for the narrow minded listener.  This is for the people who like a good  challenge and like to have their ears stretched a little bit.  Believe me,  if you're patient with this record you won't be able to put it down.  It's  almost as addictive as angel dust but with twice the kick.
0385486804|4.0|If you can ignore the fluff, this is an interesting examination of a young man with &quot;issues.&quot; Krakauer's writing is too flowery, the information on himself is gratuitous (I didn't even read the chapter he wrote about &quot;his&quot; experience) but the book is a quick read. I  found the story about the rich brat fascinating. When you come down to it,  he either had deep self-hatred or he had something to hide or both. There  is nothing wrong with questioning authority (in this case, social mores,  American society and materialism) but when done in a self-rightous way, it  comes off as arrogant. Yes, there are personalities out there that want to  conquer and test limits- bungee jumpers, Everest climbers, avalanche  skiiers- but Chris was a downright egotistical misanthrope on the brink of  being a recluse. I find that fascinating.
0440234743|4.0|I am shocked at the impotence of this drama tingling novel.My life was spent watching Johns Books go from hero to zero.I wish I could change some of the chars around.Slow read.Nice Plot.Give a four because Im old  fashioned.5 is the lowest on my scale , therefore 4 is pretty low.Give this  book a chance , John might tame your tiger.
B000002J1S|5.0|I first got this &quot;album&quot; while in high school.  It ended up being my favorite album ever..and twenty plus years later it still is my favorite album.  Awesome in everyway, musically, lyrically, production  wise.....Even after all this time I am still left emotionally drained after  each listen.  Just buy it and see for yourself.  You won't be  disappointed!
B000002BFZ|3.0|Being the big p.j. fan I am it hurts me to say this but this album is very sub par for their standards.  Ten, Vs., and Vitalogy all had one nesscessary ingrediant important to a p.j. record and that ingrediant  is:angst.  The same angst that made &quot;Animal&quot;, &quot;Not for  you&quot;, and &quot;The long road&quot; p.j. classics.  Other than  &quot;Red mosquito&quot; this album is forgettable.  Now I understand that  they wanted to switch gears with this album and I find that admirable but  it says a lot that they pretty much went back to their old ways on  &quot;Yield&quot;.  It tells me that they didn't care much for their new  &quot;direction&quot; either.  By the way the 3 stars are for effort only.

B000009QPE|5.0|this is the only album i like by slayer. its amazing how i like none of the others but this one is so badass. this is one of the first underground metal cd's i ever heard and even after going on to listen to death metal  and grindcore, this is still one of my all time favorites. i'll never get  tired of this one. its speed and musical skill still blows my mind. i love  the frantic solos and the mind-blowing speed of the drumming. i even like  the few high-pitched screams coming from tom araya (the only hint that this  cd is from the 80's). i say that &quot;raining blood&quot; is one of the  greatest songs ever. even if you dont know slayer you probably know that  one part of this song with the un-forgetable drums and guitar riff. the  only other band ive heard that can play a good version of this song is  &quot;vader&quot; and they play the whole song, not just that one part.  also, &quot;monstrosity&quot; does a wicked version of &quot;angel of  death&quot; another one of the best songs of all time. fans of speed mixed  with technical skill and awesome solos will need to hear this!
B00000761W|4.0|along with Coverdale, Ian Paice, John Lord (half Deep Purple line up), British Guitar great men Bernie Marsden, Mickey Moody is the best Line up in the 80s rock n roll history. The songs are excellent slow blues Metal!  buy this one people!
0375707972|2.0|I object in principle to books of fiction that use the holocaust as a background or as a means of furthering a plot. Go somewhere else to find the motifs of fictionalized drama, and leave those things which are sacred and still painfult to thousands, alone. It is a very rare writer who can touch that theme without cheapening or trivializing it, and this is not one of them.<br />The theme of the book (love between and older, experienced woman, and an adolescent boy) is a cliche, and the book is riddled with one improbable event after another, making for a distracting and tedious reading. The characters in the book do not become alive, and in part this is due to an improper anchoring of the point of view. An omniscient writer is bad enough, but an omniscient protagonist is intolerable.<br />Are there no redeeming values here? Of course there are. The story is sweet and sentimental and, from reading some of the more of 500 reviews posted here, it has obviously been very pleasing to many people. In my view \\"The Reader\\" should have been rewritten a few times more until it condensed itself into an acceptable short story.
B000000OYN|3.0|WHITE SNAKE is cool, but this album is not the best bunch,..Slide it in and Ready and willing are much better. I love the old versions of Crying in the rain and Here I go agagin. Slow blues Metal !
B00004SVID|5.0|I anxiously awaited the release date of this cd so I could sample if I wanted it or not. Tower records had almost the whole cd samples on their web site, but the samples made me think it was very similar to the original  recording with little variation. Then the local newspaper gave it great  reviews (a rarity). So I read other amazon reviews and decided to try it.   I was blown away!  The songs are better than the original... except  Comfortably Numb, which is better served on Pulse,  which actually improves  on the original studio version. The best is Another Brick in the Wall Pt2  which has an extended guitar solo. Also the new songs are quite cool.   Notice the lyrics to What shall we do now? are printed on the original wall  lyrics sheet, but the song is absent.  How cool to have it included here.  The last few bricks, the second &quot;new&quot; song is like an  instrumental summary of the theme of the album with some cool guitar work.  I opted for the cheap version rather than the book version, and after  hearing the cds wish I had spent the extra money for the book. If the book  is anything like that of Pulse, it would be worth the extra cash.  Not to  say the 2 booklets in the version I got aren't cool.  But they tease of  what the book might be like. Anyway...if you are skeptical, give it a  try... you might be very pleasantly surprised.
B000000OMP|5.0|this one might be a good ballad power metal album with some bluesy elements. I love the Whitesnale early line up with Jon Lord, Ian paice, Coverdale, Mickey Moody, Marsden etc... it is a half Deep Purple line up.  You love DP and you will love Whitesnake too
0451196716|4.0|This book is not what you expect.  The story, on the surface, is about a race where death is the ultimate motivation.  However, there is more too this story than that.  The story is a metaphor for life.  It will make you question why you go on living each day.  A great story.
006016848X|4.0|Although since it came out in the early '90s it has achieved almost cult status, the book had never recommended itself to me.  But I usually get  stuck in reading jags, and sex has been the topic lately.  This was one of  the more obvious books to take up under the circumstances, and I must say,  I wish I'd read it earlier.  I certainly found myself and some of my  relationships among the pages.  I found the information very helpful in  clearing up some of the causes of failed romances in the past.  (I wish I  could say I will learn from my mistakes but only time will tell).  It was  helpful also to learn that I am not especially unique in my state of  confusion over or in my awkward efforts toward life and love.
B00000J2KX|3.0|Well...the first time i saw it, I fell asleep. That's how scary it is. there are some scary scenes in it, like the two girls who suddenly appers in the hallway, and some of the scenes with JN. I mean, the actors are  truly amazing ( that's why the movie get's three stars) But the movie  really should have been more like the book.  I think the 1997 version is  better.
B000000OPQ|5.0|Well, back in high school I had the tape.  I used to listen to it on the way to cross-country meets to get psyched up.  There's just not a bad tune on this album. &quot;Only The Young&quot; is the greatest song Journey ever  recorded.  It was also the last one they recorded with the line-up from the  Frontiers album.  I also consider it the best song on this album.  But all  of them are worth a listen.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|Since her hit single If you had my Love... I have been desperate for her album. Jen is a very talented singer and actress. Her album has a great mixture of songs; love, party/dance, hip-hop ect. I really think she will  be at the top of the charts one day.
B00004SVID|5.0|I bought this CD the other day and not to my surprise it really, really rocked. This Band, or Orchestra, can really put a show together. They have been around along time and their music lives on and on.  My son who is  going to be 13 this summer loves Pink Floyd and has all their CD'S. If you  heard this before UNlive then listen to it LIVE. It's the best.
B000002IZ4|1.0|When will the radio stop playing this album?
0790744295|4.0|Old, but so magic, especially the first story. The music is also very well made. Try the fog, same style, you'll like it too!
B0000028RR|5.0|This is easily the best Rage cd.  I had the other 2 first but this one is even better, which I thought impossible.  Bombtrack, Killing in the Name Of, Know Your Enemy, and all the others are just addictive to listening to.   Not one bad track.  Its too good.  You won't be disappointed.
B00003CX7K|5.0|Hysterical!   A total laugh.  A fantastic movie for people of all ages.  I saw it with an 11 year old, 6 year old and 30 year old.  Introducing new characters.  Heartwarming story of how Woody is trying to decide between a  toy museum in Tokyo and Andy's room.  Wonderful.
B000002P5R|5.0|Jimi was heading into a funkier direction to widen his audience and was very successful in this venture. It makes you think what type of music Jimi Hendrix would make if he were still alive. Ezy Rider, Angel, Freedom, and  Dolly Dagger are my favorites on this album.
B00000J7J4|4.0|This CD has everthing from blues, to Rap, to Rock. It's great for everyone and has a song for every mood. I really like Maria, Maria, and Smooth.
078322687X|5.0|That is probably one of the best lines of the movie.  This '80s classic is not your typical teenage movie (e.g. Sex, Drugs, &amp; Rock Music) as it shows teenagers discussing their problems (Fitting in with their peers,  parental problems, etc).  It's a film that will stand the test of time  because it's different from other films of it's genre. Great performances  by Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson.
B00004IA0D|5.0|Blink 182 are my illigitimate fathers!
B00003Q438|5.0|The Abyss : Special Edition is simply amazing. And thats before you even start watching the movie itself. It has one of the coolest main menus on any dvd that i have ever seen, all done in 3D. It has to be seen to be  appreciated. There are so many added features. You really get a good  insight on how the whole movie was made and what all the people involved  creating it went through. Then there was the movie itself. With all the  added scences (28 minutes worth) I thought it made the movie much better  than its original theatrical release. I was never really a huge fan of the  Abyss, but since i bought this DVD i am now. This is what DVD is all about.
0060977493|5.0|Arundhati Roy managed to weave a haunting gossamer web. Exquisitely and painfully beautiful, she brought me into broken hearts and made me comprehend how they came to be that way.
B00004RHZU|5.0|she is one of those girls you dont want to mess with but she is very  talented at the same time.  she has a beautiful voice with a high quality  singing technique. i love her CD because it's wondreful to listen to and  enspiring to all woman of the world  this is not a CD for the faint  hearted!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002URV|5.0|I have had this CD for just over 10 years now and the fact that I still take it out and play it a few times a months speaks for itself. If I think back to the other CD's I bought around the same time, I guarantee I am not  still listening to any of them or have since 1990. Enigma's (Michael Cretu)  breakthrough CD is a masterful blend of complex chants, vocals, sounds,  synthesizers and beats layered together to perfection.  This music is Great  for relaxation, driving or working to. You can listen to this CD hundreds  of times and not get sick of it. Still Enigma 1 is his best work to date,  but the others are worth a listen especially Enigma 3 and the latest  release &quot;The Screen Behind the Mirror&quot; which are just a notch  below.
B0000062S0|2.0|I'll pretend that the pioneering rock band Led Zeppelin, the group that bludgeoned American Blues music with a sledgehammer, never existed. Walking Into Clarksdale is presented by two old guys named Jimmy Page and Robert  Plant, and two young guys named Charlie Jones and Michael Lee. Jimmy  screams the lyrics in a high-pitched whine that's dreadfully irritating.  The lyrics are nonsensical mythological babbling about \\"dancing upon the  sea' (Shining In The Light), \\"ruling the stars and the sun\\" (Most High),  and \\"seeing my footsteps through eternity\\" (When The World Was Young).   Pretentious and comical.<br />The compositions either wander aimlessly (Blue  Train, Heart In Your Hand, When I Was A Child), or fall victim to  self-indulgent overproduction (Please Read The Letter, Burning Up, House Of  Love). Michael is a competent drummer, but his spartan playing is no match  for Jimmy's melodramatic singing or Robert's flamboyant guitar technique.  Perhaps the songs would have a stronger rhythm if Charlie's bass was more  pronounced: it's buried so deep in the production, that he may as well have  not shown for the recording sessions. I wasn't expecting Led Zeppelin XI,  but I'm very disappointed that Walking Into Clarksdale fails to stand on  its own merits.
B000002AV5|5.0|While anticipating Sade's next release, this album has been more than enough to hold me over until it  comes out. Most greatest hits compilations do not even have half of my favorite tracks from the artist on them, but  this one is an exception. This is also one of the few collections that I  can listen to from beginning to end without skipping any tracks. My  favorites are The Sweetest Taboo, Kiss Of Life, Cherish The Day, No  Ordinary Love, Love Is Stronger Than Pride, and Your Love Is King.
B00000DCHI|4.0|The good songs are on here...great buy.
B000001EAQ|4.0|After its marcketing prior to release, U2 fans thought that the band had gone from rock to pop. Who bought the record, and many did, found out that it just wasn´t true. There are one or two pop tunes but underneath the  lights and glitter, you will find a genuine rock album. Some great songs  written from the heart. For those greater fans you will notice a sense of  religious self doubt. Or is it just my impression?<br />They still have what  it takes. Not as great as Joshua Tree of Achtung Baby but sure points in  the right direction.
B000005RW4|5.0|This is the album that introduced me to Neil Young.  I bought it purely because I love Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson, who appear on several tracks.  Previously, I had a preconceived view that Neil Young was loud and  noisy!  I still prefer his accoustic stuff, but at least I learned the  errors of my ways.  This album holds its own in any category, i.e. country  or rock, and comes highly recommended.
0394716787|5.0|I am not saying that you have to believe everything that is contained in this book.  Some people might find certain things too frightening to believe however historically accurate an account might be, and Poe has been  charged with a number of hoaxes which presented literature in a magazine  that had pretenses of reporting on actual events.  My normal method of  study is with a concordance, so that I can see how an author uses  particular terms, and I would have no idea where to look to see if Poe ever  used the word &quot;horsefeathers.&quot;  Nevertheless, in the field of  thought which is most interesting to me, best summarized as ways of being  deadly, Poe is the American intellectual figure who towers above all the  rest.  Hardly anyone else should even dare to recite a line from an  outstanding poem, &quot;Ulalume~A Ballad&quot; which simply says, &quot;Our  talk had been serious and sober.&quot;  Poetic science begins with the  ability to find that line in this book.
B000002GVO|5.0|This album is the best by a band that is one of the top bands in rock history, and the single Hotel California would be enough to gain 5 stars in my book. Life in the Fast Lane and New Kid in Town are also great songs,  representing the peak of this great band's career.
B000002BE9|5.0|There is a certain toughness in this much honesty, which can be difficult to succumb to at times when this seems dreary, but I would like to pick &quot;Never is a Promise&quot; as a great song for expressing something.   This might be a better pick if I had no idea where this is coming from.  I  think Fiona Apple was born for history, whether she knows anything about  history or not.  She certainly seems to know something.
B000002U82|5.0|Nothing I say will do justice to this masterpiece.
B00003CWN3|5.0|All of the actors in this movie were incredible. Highly recommended.
6303418287|5.0|I saw this again for the third time last week, and it still hasn't lost any of its charm.  I'm glad to see a movie that actually remains faithful to the book.  As a fellow reviewer wrote, \\"Frankenstein\\" is a tragedy, not a horror novel/movie.  Though it can go a bit over the top at  times, the performances by Branagh and Helena Bonham Carter are exquisite,  and De Niro's monster is suprisingly moving.  Especially if you are a fan  of the book, or of superb acting, don't miss this movie.
6305750750|3.0|i have been eagerly anticipating the release of the dvd since i saw it in the theater. but now as we all know the dvd won't be out until whenever so i decided to get the tape. whatever you do don't buy the pan-n-scan  version. the awful job they did on this dvd-worthy movie is second only to  the re-release pan-n-scan version of ghostbusters (shudder). the only  options you should even consider are to either 1)buy the overpriced  widescreen movie/box-o-junk or 2)borrow/rent a widescreen version. 5 stars  for actual movie, 4 stars for the widescreen VHS, zero for pan-n-scan VHS.  (5+4+0)/3 = 3 stars
B000002U82|5.0|Listening to Dark Side of the Moon is like eating chocolate for 45 minutes straight.  I would have to say it is one of, if not THE best rock album ever recorded.  Pink Floyd wonderfullly uses the element of timing, and  waiting perfectly.  They know exactly when to come in, for how long, and  how to end it.  The whole album is like a complete work, not a bunch of  different songs, so, therefore there are no 'bad' songs.  It all fits  perfectly building up to the finale: Brain Damage/Eclipse.  I have never  heard Pink Floyd before, I picked up this album, and I was an instant fan.   I was obsessed, I now have to buy every single album and know everything  about them.  ANYONE, with the exception of people with really bad taste  (i.e. anyone that likes any of these sellout punk/rock bands) can cherish  this album.  I am 14 and I think this is a little bit of heaven--right next  to Miles Davis's Kind Of Blue.  THIS ALBUM IS A MUST FOR ANYONE!  ANYONE!
6302256615|5.0|This movie was very entertaining, very action-packed and with Keanu in it, it could be 120 minutes of him smiling at the camera and I'd give it five stars !
B000002G23|5.0|How many bands have left a legacy of their work which holds up so amazingly well for so long?  To this day, it is impossible to name another band which sounds anything like The Police, and this box set lays it all  out there -- and leaves you breathless in its vast and impressive wake.  From the early attempts at punk (silly though endearing attempts, given  that the punk dynamic is based on the ability to NOT play well -- The  Police were always top notch musicians) to the last new wave stylings of  the Synchronicity sessions, MESSAGE IN A BOX is a lasting record of perhaps  the most orignial sounding band ever.  If you are not a fan, you will be --  if you already are, come on in, the water's fine.
B000002H72|5.0|The first real great Pixies album, &quot;Doolittle&quot; used small bits of freeform poetry and loud, abrasive guitar to show that they were changing rock into avant-garde music for the better. No more was rock music  just a 'sound' anymore, but the calls of another dimension or a dearanged  work of art. Don't think of Black as a psychotic killer with the mind of an  artist, though. He is very misunderstood, and he is just telling his side  of life. Although that is expressed better in the future Pixies albums, and  especially with Frank Black's solo carreer, &quot;Doolittle&quot; is still  a worthy patriarch of &quot;Black Art&quot;. If you are a true Frank Black,  you will acknowledge that his pre-transformation as Black Francis was as  necessary as was David Bowie's transformation into Ziggy Stardust or The  Thin White Duke. &quot;Monkey Gone To Heaven&quot; is the best song, it  might be a testament for the end of the world or the troubles ahead. Some  of the songs feature that mixture of nonchalantly played bass and guitar,  while the rest are nicely produced. &quot;Gouge Away&quot; is also a great  song. Get this if you are a Frank Black fan in any way, shape, or form.
B000001Y5X|4.0|If you think KoRn has something to say, you never really listened to Marilyn Manson's debut. Instead of bashing him for not making another Beautiful People kind of riff, go to your nearest cd store and buy this  thing. Manson doesn't hate women, or cops, or children, he simply describes  the world as it really is and was when he was a kid. This CD has a really  bashing sound to it and the lyrics are like targeting a bullet to  light-minded persons. Portrait is just what the title suggests and it's one  of the best hard rock albums made in the 90s. While KoRn and other  i-just-hate-everything-cause-its-fashionable losers are enjoying their  ADIDAS and NIKE outfits, Manson attacks for the sake of intelligence.
B000003TA4|5.0|With the release of Bleach Nirvana started a musical revolution, which was largely ignored until Smells Like Teen Spririt rocketed up the charts in 1991.<br />Nevermind was to prove the band's defining momement. Smells Like  Teen Spirit sets the standard which the rest of the album follows. From the  heavy grunge of Territorial Pissing to the slow, almost dirge-like  Something in the Way, Kurt Cobain's fantastic lyrics and the band's awesome  musical prowess shine through.<br />This is, arguably, the greatest album of  all time and which everyone should have heard.<br />The album's true greatness  is illustrated by the fact tthat neither before nor since has the grunge  scene captivated so many people and that this scene died with Kurt Cobain  in 1994.<br />Believe the hype.
B000002HAF|5.0|With your feet on the air andyour head on the ground, try to listen to PIXIES and not like it. God, this is a great album,it was my first Pixies album and soon it grew all inside my nerves. Then i bought Doolittle and i  knew i was standing right in front of a major name in rock history. This is  a band that never pretended to be mean, disturbing, or stylish, but they  did. They are tue prototype of the ideal rock band, the kidn of thing that  you dream when you play on your garage or your bedroom. This album will hit  you the same way it hit Kurt Cobain and most of the musicians in these  days. Something like this is hard to rise again.
0790729709|5.0|&quot;The Bodyguard&quot; is my favorite movie. I've seen it already about 50 times and I can't really get enough of it. Whitney's acting is incredible! And her voice! I've become a fan of HER after this movie. I  also like Kevin Costner very much. He's a good actor. Whitney and Kevin are  the best duett onscreen, they should do one more film together.  The  Bodyguard is the best movie of all times and it still makes me cry!
B00000AFGM|4.0|Manson got out of his Antichrist Superstar mood and now attacks today's emptyness from two different and opposed views. Omega is a glam rock all star that loves being stupid and knows it. The Alien is an entity that  feels sad about earthlings being so naive and stupid,he's watching us from  above, and analyzing our ways with sarcasm and absolutely no hope. Listen  to this CD, it's really well produced, and the topics are very intriguing.  I love Manson for his outbursts on today's questioning. Anyway the best  parts of it are Great Big White World, Dope Show, Last Night on Earth,  Speed of Pain, Dissasociative, Coma White and User Friendly. Mechanical  Animals is a new kind of concept album from one of the most notorious rock  bands out there.
B000007RYQ|1.0|At first, I was quite pleased when a friend gave me what I thought was a Mahler CD. Until I listened to it, that is.  <br />I could not fathom why the instruments were so horribly out of tune, sliding and screeching their way  around the notes and rhythms. I was aghast, then hysterical with laughter.   I kept the CD to play for friends, who were either too pained or nauseated  to listen. Some joined in my derisive laughter, asking to hear it again and  again, as one would repeatedly watch his favorite episode of the Three  Stooges.<br />Mahler's 5th Symphony and &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot; are very  dear to me, having performed these works.  &quot;Kindertotenlieder&quot;  are a study in expressivity and the depths of grief.  Caine has made a  silly, stupid mockery of these profound works.  Equally ridiculous, the  packaging and liner notes of the CD insinuate that of a classical work.   Again, the pretension is absurd and laughable.
0312853238|5.0|&quot;Ender's Game&quot; blew me away.  Mainly it was the characters that astounded me.  Their very human feelings, their deep layers of emotion and many doubts, made them real people instead of a group of imagined characters sprung out of the head of the author. Once I started  &quot;Ender's Game&quot; I could not put it down.  I savored every word,  loved every minute spent with my nose in it.  This book is a true  masterpiece.

B000002C25|3.0|It's not as good as the super-duper excellent sounds you would expect from Oasis, which makes it seem all the worse, even though it is infact good.<br />All of the songs are drawn out, and seem to have one chorus too  many tagged on at the end of them. It's a little annoying, but it shouldn't  stop Oasis fans from enjoying this one.<br />These were tough times for Oasis  (according to VH1's Behind The Music), so you can't blame them for at least  trying to make one epic of a record.<br />My favorites include &quot;Stand By  Me&quot;, &quot;The Girl In The Dirty Shirt&quot;, and &quot;Don't Go  Away&quot;. Multiply those by four and you've got yourself another  &quot;What's The Story Morning Glory&quot; on your hands.
B000002H6C|5.0|If you like the sound of the late-80's heavy metal at its best, then you will love this album...my favorite Metallica album ever! However, if you prefer the new sound that Metallica has evolved to for the 90's audience  (which is most people) then you would probably like the self-titled Black  Album better. This album is great and features Metallica at their  loudest.One, Blackened, And Justice For All are all really good tracks.
B00000K2SD|5.0|I think this definitely is the best movie I've ever seen. It's plot line is perfect and with the graphics and action added it makes this one of the greatest movies of all time.
0446525537|5.0|This is the first book that I wanted to finish and didn't have to. I finished it in two days!. I was so into the story that I couldn't put it down. The characters seem so real and their situations are just the same. I loved it. This was my first Nicholas Sparks book and it made a good  impression on me that he is a good writer. This would be a great gift. This  book is the best story about  falling in love with the girl that was not  very popular and not liked. I highly recommened it.

0671042858|1.0|I've been a Stephen King fan for years, but this one takes the cake.  It was a boring  and predictable story.  This book would be good for pre-teens who are interested in beginning to read science fiction.  A horror book it is NOT.  I barely stayed awake to read the end which I had already figured  out in chapter one!  The only good thing about this book is it was SHORT.
B00003W8NM|5.0|&quot;Fight Club&quot; is the best picture of the year.  No, I'm not surprised that it was spurned at the Oscars. Most films of this nature never receive immediate praise, but become classics nonetheless. David  Fincher is quickly becoming one of the best directors we have. It is great  to see that someone's not afraid to take risks in film-making.  Also,  Edward Norton is fantastic; I love his acting.  He's real, interesting, and  fun to watch.  This film does have an odd twist, which I'll admit, is tough  to swallow, but if you show patience (and an open mind) &quot;Fight  Club&quot; will certainly pay off.
B000002KGT|5.0|The songwriting skills on this album are superb!  This is right now the 3rd best selling album of all time, and it truly deserves all the sales it gets plus more..Stevie Nicks, the most talented and finest souding female  singer/songwriter of all time, she gives Fleetwood Mac such classics to  this album as the #1 song Dreams, Gold Dust Woman, and I Don't Want to  Know.. The Christine McVie and Lindsey Buckingham songs are also  superb..especially Christine's haunting &quot;Songbird&quot;. Most people  have a copy of Rumours, it won a grammy for album of the year in 78 and  needs a grammy for album of the year every year! No matter what anyone  tells you, most reviews are good however, this is definatly one album you  cannot afford not to buy! Buy all the Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks  albums, but most of all buy this one!
6305657947|4.0|...still, quite an enjoyable picture, and definitely one of the best films to come out of Hollywood last year.  And...here's the biggest shocker of all...it's among the rarest of breeds, a remake that is actually BETTER  than its predecessor, and still respectful of said predecessor (see Faye  Dunaway's well-placed cameo as Thomas Crown's psychiatrist as proof of this  respect).<br />Everything clicks in this film: the acting is first-rate, from  Pierce Brosnan and the ever-hot Rene Russo on down to Denis Leary (who  turns in perhaps the best performance of the film as a good cop - a  definite break from his more typical roles).<br />The music is also superb -  Bill Conti, often maligned for his contributions to the Rocky series as  well as the atypically disco-influenced Bond score in For Your Eyes Only,  turns in an amazing set of compositions that go very well with what we see  on screen.  (Sadly, though, the soundtrack album leaves out many of these  compositions...another story for another time).<br />But perhaps the ultimate  success of The Thomas Crown Affair can be attributed to John McTiernan, the  genius behind Die Hard and The Hunt For Red October.  McTiernan gives us a  visually resplendent picture on all levels - the scenery, the quality of  the picture, and the framing (if you'll forgive the pun) of certain scenes,  especially the museum scenes where Thomas Crown both steals and puts back  the priceless works of art - which makes The Thomas Crown Affair a  particular pleasure to watch on DVD (this was one of my very first DVD  acquisitions, and...at least among my burgeoning collection...it is far and  away the DVD that takes best advantage of the new technology's enhanced  capabilities).<br />This is very enjoyable fare that is difficult not to  enjoy, even with skeptics of Hollywood - namely myself - included...and it  is most definitely light years better than the contemporaneous look-alike  (but not made-alike) &quot;Entrapment&quot;.  Highly recommended!ommended!
0064471837|5.0|I love this book so much! It has a plot the you dive in to and can keep you going long in to the night (when you should be sleeping, hehe).  this is my very favorite book and I tell all my friends to read it.
B0000021RB|5.0|It is usually uncommon when a successful band's first album is their best, but in Chicago's case, it is.  Even though it was slammed by critics, I think it is safe to assume that people have had second thoughts about it.   It truly is a rocking album, with songs such as &quot;Poem 58&quot; and  &quot;Southern California Purples&quot; (as well as &quot;I'm A Man&quot;)  that showcase Terry Kath's gifted yet underrated skill as a guitarist.   Most of the music has a Jimi Hendrix sound with horns thrown in.  And of  course, you really can't forget &quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It  Is&quot; and &quot;Beginnings&quot;, perhaps two of the greatest pieces of  music this band has performed.  The album surprisingly stands up pretty  well with other classic rock albums of its time.  <br />As for the reviewer  below who feels Chicago was meant to be a cheesy power ballad band of the  80's, it's a shame this person obviously isn't a fan of rock &amp; roll.   This is a great album and should not be overlooked.
0312853238|5.0|If you like reading for fun, this is a book for you! I am not sure about depth, meaning or style, but one thing is clear enough: Ender's Game has it all: great character's development, a fantastic adventure background and  convincing action.
B000005GX7|5.0|This truly is the pinnacle of Joe Henderson's performing career--and what better setting than a live trio to showcase him. Ron and Al are equally miraculous and share the spotlight deservingly. This music has really  touched me emotionally and I have seldom heard such an awe-inspiring group  like this.
B0000399WI|5.0|I saw this late last night and, as normally happens with a good book, am still savoring the sheer, sweeping beauty of this wonderful movie.<br />Some things that stay in the mind are the patience of &quot;All things come to  those who write&quot; Andy in making his escape, the lovely voice of Morgan  Freeman, and the amazing shot of the Pacific at the very end.
B000020617|3.0|I was real excited when this album came out.  I really loved the first release and I thought this album was really going to put others to shame.  When I got it, I was really disappionted.  The only good songs were the  first four.  The rest of it is a collection of extremely slow, boring   songs.  I really loved their last album but this one was a letdown.  So, if  you're looking for an album that rocks, don't buy this one.  If you really  want to get a cool Foo Fighters album, get The Colour and the Shape.
B000000WJZ|5.0|If you're looking for rock in its highest element, this is your album.  The Pumpkins show that they're not just the bunch of whiny punks people say they are: Siamese Dream shows their love of the music. They are the only  talented rock group left.
B000002KHB|5.0|First of all folks. MACHINE HEAD is not the only lp ever released by Deep Purple. Part of a flexible series of connecting links in a chain of music from one of the most gifted groups of monster musicians in the history of  the world! Man! That was a mouth full,but I just had to say it.:-) After  MarkI took Garage band sounds to a new level. And IN ROCK made the  announcement to the world.&quot;A new commitment to excellence is now  expected from us all&quot; FIREBALL kept the pace going. The first time you  heard HIGHWAY STAR on the radio. Didn't it make you feel like you were  doing 110 on the autobahn? MAYBE I'M A LEO is probably the weakest song on  MACHINE HEAD. But it's not a 2nd rate song at all.Just a measurement of how  strong the rest of this cd is! PICTURES OF HOME and NEVER BEFORE are only  found on MACHINE HEAD and make it worth the price you would pay for MACHINE  HEAD! LAZY&amp;SPACE TRUCKIN' are the true work horses of any Purple  concert. Just listen to MADE IN JAPAN!(like you havent already?) Jon Lord  has proven time after time,he can do more and put in more power,with one  chord or note. Then all those Tinker Bell fairy keyboard players put  together! Then there is that song Joe&amp;Jane Public has made synonymous  with the Deep Purple name. Thats right?  SMOKE ON THE WATER. Not since  SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE or IN-A-GOTTA-DA-VIDA or WHOLE LOTTA LOVE has a basic  riff grabed ahold of the whole world. Proving one more time that as complex  this place gets.Bringing it back to basics is what makes the Rock&amp;Roll  world go round&amp;round.Just can't imagine life without Deep Purples  MACHINE HEAD. If they did only put out one cd,this would be it! But  then,WHO DO WE THINK WE ARE?
B000001Y5J|5.0|So, it's only 6 real songs... only 5 even by Trent and NIN... oh well. Those five songs smoke anything on any of their other albums by far... the music has much more feeling, much more raw energy, and by far much more  meaning than almost anything else the group has done. Everything else falls  flat in comparison. If you like NIN and don't have this CD (what's wrong  with you? ) get up and get it now!
B000002W9Q|5.0|Above all, (I've Had) The Time Of My Life is probably the best song ever made. (In my opinion.) This was the theme of our junior/senior prom and after that night, I went straight out and bought the album. The song really  means a lot to me since I graduate next year. A girl I've had a crush on  this year is leaving and I plan to play this for her after graduation. I  also plan to play it after my graduation. It just seems right, doesn't it?  Get down and boogie and have the time of YOUR life today!
B000002N3J|5.0|I must say I was quite impressed with this album. I got this album as a gift, and I'm thankful I received it. Every song on the album is wonderful, she catches the essence of her voice beautifully. I wasn't too thrilled  with &quot;crazy for you&quot; or &quot;rain&quot;, but the rest of the cd  makes up for it. She has songs for every type of mood, from &quot;nobody  can bring me down&quot; to bad breakups. Definately worth checking out.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is a masterpiece worth buying at any price.  A beautiful and enjoyable album which can be compared to the greats, such as the Beatles Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and so on.  It is not  only the greatest album by Pink Floyd (tying with The Wall) but in my  opinion, the greatest album of all time.  I guarentee you will enjoy such  songs as &quot;Breath,&quot; &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Brain Damage.&quot;   I can't listen to it enough.  Dave Gilmour's guitar play is at its peak  and Roger Water's lyrics are fantastic and complexing.  Buy this album (and  buy The Wall while you're at it) and enjoy.
B000000OXH|5.0|Along with TOTO, ASIA is one of my favorites Groups in the AOR gene.<br />Well, ALPHA is my favorite ASIA album. You got to check all the HOWE and DOWNES work there, the performance is just awesome!  (e.g. Eye to  eye, Don't cry, Midnight sun, Never in a Million years). I bought this  album in the very 1983 (when I was only a 13 y.o. kid), and I say so: I  STILL LOVE IT !
B00000AFWW|5.0|i agree with &quot;unscathed&quot; that this will stand the test of time.i have never played a record so much in my life and i think i still havent experienced half of it!its completely transcendent to some place and some  time youve experienced especially if youve loved and lost.i hope the next  one is this good.courtney love may be a trainwreck but this record is  flawless!you MUST OWN this! oh here's a great line from celebrity skin:  &quot;in your endless summer night i'll be on your other side, when you're  beautiful and dying, all the world that you've denied&quot; i own two  celebrity skin cds and will be replacing them throughout my life i can tell   i've only given two records a perfect score (this and led zeppelin's 3  under my former name) so let the record show that
0440224764|3.0|Decent Grisham tale of Patrick Lanigan, the law partner who faked his own death and stole $90 million from his firm.  As in any Grisham novel, he creates firm characters and a great story.  This one gets a bit wordy, but overall, it's not bad.
B000001ESF|5.0|This was the first Rush album I'd ever bought.  It was definitely a good pick, considering all the rave reviews I had heard about Rush.  I had once listened to the album a few years before actually buying it.  I couldn't  believe how good they sounded, which grabbed me instantly and drove me to  purchasing 2112.  Anyone who doesn't own this album has to at least listen  to a few of the songs on it.  Train to Bangkok is good, as is most of the  Overture part of the album.... definitely a collector's item for anyone who  is a Rush fan.
B000000OSW|3.0|Not Gabriel's best - a mix of some fun songs (Steam, Digging in the Dirt, Kiss That Frog) and some weaker world-beat music.  Definitely a step down from So.
B000001EUP|4.0|This is by far the best Matthias Jabs album with Scorpions. ITs a shame that an authentic German rock band, with strong musicians and intelligent lyrics, turned to the &quot;I LOVE YOU&quot; lyrics since &quot;BIG CITY  NIGHTS&quot;. Its a shame...
B000000OPU|4.0|When Peter Gabriel went a little more mainstream, the results were huge. So was his biggest hit ever, and indicates a mix of Gabriel's art rock/world music crossed with 80's pop.  Standout songs include Big Time,  Don't Give Up, That Voice Again, Red Rain, and of course, Sledgehammer.
B000001EUR|4.0|Theres a lot of different material in this CD. I think this was the last worthwhile album by Scorpions, before they completely sold out to make commercial music. &quot;CROSSFIRE&quot; is a forgotten master-piece.
6305205620|5.0|i went to a metallica concert 6 yeras a go, by  now it was the best show i have ever been. but.... this DVD is even better, YES even better then the real show, the best 5.1 Dolby digital sound i have ever heared (especially  &quot;ONE&quot;). multy angel video, just unbelievable ! <br />PURCHASE,  PURCHASE, PURCHASE ! <br />i hope pink floyd will follow them and release a  DVD concert !
0671042858|5.0|I had wanted this book since it came out. I wasn't a big King fan, but liked the plot of the story, so my mother got me the book on tape. I LOVED it. It was a great book. I felt myself putting myself in the main  character's shoes. I loved it. It was a great book!
059035342X|5.0|I just finished Harry Potter and the Sorcerers' Stone and I can't wait to get the others!  The writing was so good, I couldn't put it down.  J K Rowling is a superb writer... such great expression in her charactors, it made me laugh out loud on several occassions.  These are destined to become classics!  I must have them all.  I am 38 and I am now a BIG Harry fan!
B000024Z5N|4.0|Established Focus in the eyes of the world. This mainly instrumental album opens with the eccentric hit &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, the tracks thereafter are more subdued, even romantic yet almost melancholic. The final track  &quot;Eruption&quot;, however, threads together several eclectic pieces  into an extended, dynamic and compelling work (23mins). The album is  definitely in the progressive realm. An amalgam of european folk, classical  &amp; medieval music with a smattering of jazz. The talents of Jan Akkerman  (guitar) and Thijs Van Leer (keyboards, flute &amp; vocal gymnastics) are  truly unique.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|I personally didn't like the cd.  I like mostly pop music but also some hard rock and latin.  In the CD it seems like she is trying to be someone who has done this for years and knows a ton but Jennifer admit it you don't  know what you are doing.  I f you are thinking of buying this Cd, don't, it  will be a big dissapointment.
B000002LCX|5.0|Most of the Smiths fans I've met tend to disagree with me, but I rank this album as equal with the Queen is Dead.  From the opening, haunting lyrics of &quot;A Rush and a Push...,&quot; all the way through to the end, this  is a masterpiece!  &quot;Paint a Vulgar Picture&quot; is a classic track --  one of the very best ever from the Smiths/Morrissey.
0446777013|5.0|This book was wonderfully interesting. Sugar Blues opened a pandoras box on the topic of sugar.  It looked at sugar in relation to its philosophy and causes of disease and illness.  It takes you through many centuaries of  sugar consumption, from the years of troubled souls and bewitchment up  until the modern problems of our world such as hyperactivity and  schizophrenia. This book is a must for any parent, naturopath, nutritionst  or health care practioner. Other nooks I have found relevant to this is Get  the sugar Out : 501 Simple Ways to Cut the Sugar in Any Diet by Ann Louise  Gittleman, as after reading, sugar blues, it suggests many ways to avoid  the ailing sugar blues.
B000002L7J|5.0|I bought this lp in 1986 (yes, I have the CD today).  I heard an ad on KROQ for an upcoming LA concert - music sounded great in the short radio blip, so I went out to buy my first Smiths album.  Little did I know what I  was getting myself into....  Sixty seconds into &quot;The Headmaster  Ritual,&quot; I was hooked, and soon became a most devoted fan.  What a  fantastic, brilliant song &quot;The Headmaster Ritual&quot; is!   An  excellent album all the way through, though not #1 on a ranking of Smiths  albums.  One never forgets their first Smiths experience, so this one will  always have a special place in my collection.
6305594252|3.0|It has been buried for thousand of years maybe this movie should have been buried longer. Obviously we know that this duo of director and  producer prize possesion is Independence Day wich is far more entertaining good  specal effects but  it's fails to be only mediocre,good cast alot of option  icluding the specal edition wich dosen't make much of a diffrence your best  bet is to get ID4 on DVD when it comes out in June.
B000001FYL|5.0|BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT!  SONGS LIKE &quot;SANTA FE&quot;, AND &quot;MIRICLE&quot; SHOW BON JOVI'S FINEST WORKS!   I LOVE IT!
B000002TQB|5.0|&quot;Blur&quot; (the one with Song 2 on it) gets 3, &quot;13&quot; gets 4 just because of the awesome singles &quot;Tender&quot; and &quot;Coffee and TV&quot;, but before they went all art-rock and slow on us, they put some  damn great rock music, and this album captures it all perfectly. Where else  can you find 16 great songs crammed into 53 minutes? Oasis sucks compared  to these guys---&quot;Parklife&quot; is timeless.
0780624890|5.0|Awesome Movie! :) I would give it 10 Stars if I could.
6300216209|5.0|Few movies have ever made me cry; this is one of those movies.  &quot;Love Story&quot; wonderfully combines humor with heart-felt drama.  Sure, Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw were not the best actors, but their chemistry makes  up for lack of acting prowess.  This movie conveys genuine emotion without  becoming overly sappy. A must see for the hopeless romantics :o)
B00000JCOV|3.0|I first heard Wait and Bleed on the Scream 3 soundtrack, and loved it.  I thought it was an excellent song, and I was eager to hear more from this band.  I got the CD, and listened to it.  How disappointing!  I mean it  does deserve its 3 stars that I gave it, but really.  The only thing the  singer does is SCREAM!   That kinda stuff is ok, but that is not talent.   Not by any stretch of the imagination.  I would really like to hear more  songs like Wait and Bleed.  Phenomenal song.....
6304698526|5.0|this is a great film it hase alot of car chasesinit and gunfights
B00003OSU4|4.0|I purchased this DVD with a bit of trepidation, unsure of whether my image of what could be with the DVD format and what this disk might use would match.  From a musical standpoint, this is an outstanding addition to the  collection.  Theloneus Monk, in particular, stands out.<br />From a movie  standpoint, it's o.k. I was fascinated the first time I watched it for  about a half an hour.  After that, the crowd scenes and the boat races do  not add as much to the musical landscape.  And while it is interesting  movie-making that there is no real narration, letting the sounds come from  the artists, the crowd, and an occassional clip, some explanation of who we  are seeing or what is going on might be helpful, if only for future  reference. Perhaps the only downside to the DVD is that it provides a  complete playlist for the festival which reads as a roster of jazz greats,  with performances by Ray Charles and Chuck Berry thrown in.  Yet the movie  only plays a portion of those and I am left to wonder why so many great  artists were left out of the final version--the production notes indicate  the musicians signed on out of curiosity and does not mention any  hold-outs, yet many are forgotten.  While this is good, that additional  knowledge makes me long for something more, where Miles Davis and others  were included in the feature.   Still, this is a remarkable musical piece  with decent eye candy, making it much more worth the purchase price that  the numerous movies that will only be watched once and then forgotten.
0783239955|1.0|I had heard that this was hilarious, and I knew it was French. I was operating then under the delusional belief that French films must by nature be better than American films. I don't know, maybe that's true, but if so,  this one was a fluke.<br />This movie is juvenile and idiotic. It is  predictible, trite, simplistic, and (worst of all) unfunny. It is more  worthy of American television than French film. I was startled by how bad  it was. What a waste of time.
B000002MG1|5.0|This is a sober and sensative examination of our own mortality. Very impressive. It should be on everyone's CD rack.
B00000K0DT|5.0|The Usual Suspects is the kind of film that you get what you put into it.It is a movie that you watch and then determine your own thoughts about it but it definately a movie that director Bryan Singer didn't want you to  think you could  figure out quickly.It is well respected be cause of the  fact that it is a complex film and will , make you think.The Director spent  time on beleving in this story and the charachter development.<br />   A drug  deal goes wrong on a large boat and many people die somehow the drugs also  seem to  missing , the main suspect seems to be Dan Keaton played by  (Gabriel Byrne)who devises a plan for this drug deal to go down the polices  only witness is a lymping man whom was part of Keaton's crew  played  perfectly by (Kevin Spacey) who won an , Academy Award for his performance  he tells about how his crew thwarted the police and took plans  and  information from a welthy lawyer named kobayashe.<br />    He also mentions a  name that many people fear a name that even the mention of it would be  terrible the police push this man to see weither this Kiser Sose is just a  sheild or a ploy to cover up who to blame once you see the suprise ending  youll wonder weither you didn't think of the ending sooner but when you  watch it again if you watch closely you will see that all of the peices  start to fit.<br />    This movie has the original theatrical trailer and a  great and worth watching commentary by Bryan Singer good options and an  incredible movie that  you will want to watch over and over its a fair bet  you won't get tired of watching it.
6305807086|5.0|Wow! To begin, I've always enjoyed John Malkovich's talent as an actor, but to be fair he is very nearly outshined by John Cusack and Catherine Keener.<br />Imagine for a moment that you find a strange door somewhere, and  once you enter, you become John Malkovich, and see his world through his  eyes. Then after 15 minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of  the New Jersey Turnpike. Throughout this odd sojourn into J.M.'s mind and  body is an odd love triangle between Cusack, Keener, and Cusack's wife,  played by Cameron Diaz.<br />The greed and avarice that becomes apparent in  all three of these characters is intense, as John Malkovich becomes simply  a means to an end, much to his own dismay.<br />Buy, rent, borrow a copy of  this film. You will not be disappointed.
B00001QEE8|5.0|Walt's last project, and perhaps the finest animated script ever.  Who could critisize the snappy Louie Prima, warm voice of Harris as Baloo the bear, or the unusual animation plot of a boy being fostered into manhood by  a variety of morally(and immorally) oriented male animals.  Although shot  fairly flat compared to the more modern animations and films, the  characteristic acting animation will never fail to enthral any viewer.  The  DVD isn't bad, but VHS will do in a pinch.  Get it, especially if you have  never seen it!
B000023X9W|4.0|The full page adds in all the music press magazines proclaim &quot;a new harvest for the world&quot;, intimating a further installment of the  Harvest(72) and Harvest Moon (92)saga. After several plays,I find Silver  and Gold more of a progression of the 1978 album Comes a Time.  This is  Neil Young in a mellow,warm and reflective mood. The songs show a man at  ease with what he's got, and what he's had and done. Surrounding himself  with the &quot;feel good&quot; subjects such as &quot;Daddy went  walkin&quot;, &quot;Buffalo Springfield Again&quot; and the love that is  better than &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; . Calling on the services of old  faithfulls like Ben Keith, Spooner Oldham, Linda Rondstadt and Emmylou  Harris and others ,he just gives the impression of a man at peace with his  lot and celebrating along with old friends. If this is your first sampling  of the softer accoustic Neil Young , then I would try Harvest Moon, but if  you've already been down that road and want to venture on I'm sure you will  not be dissappointed with &quot;Silver and Gold&quot;.
B0000027I6|4.0|If you do not own this record yet and you have doubts about buying it because you read some bad reviews, dont worry, by the moment that you listen to &quot;watching t.v.&quot;, you will start crying i guarantee

630562285X|1.0|1 star because it's better than listening to a droning jet engine for 3 hours. The story is dumb, there is no chemistry between the two stars, and the story is real dumb. Did I say the story is dumb? Jones is a  thief/insurance investigator who is hired/forced to capture the old master,  played by Connery, except she falls in love, a la The Thomas Crowne Affair,  with the bad guy and they run off into the sunset together. Except there  doesn't appear to be any real motivation for the two thieves to work  together and we never see any affection develop between the two. I guess  we're just suppossed to assume that 2 good-looking people must naturally  love each other. Insomniacs will enjoy the interminable \\"teaching Zeta  how to crawl in-and-around a ridiculous amount of crossed laser beams\\"  scene.
6302491940|5.0|This is one of the finest heist films ever committed to celluloid. This is one of the finest ensemble performances assembled. This is, without question, one of the finest films of its genre. <br />Michael Caine is, as  always, smooth and calculating and funny in his subtle, English way. The  heist and the set up to the heist are handled brilliantly. I am a longtime  fan of all heist films and this has to be, alongside &quot;The Taking of  Pelham 1-2-3&quot;, the best. From Caine's dead associate talking to him  from beyond the grave on reels of black and white film...outlining the  whole heist....to the flawless execution of the plan, the pure excitement  of the chase scene (The BEST CAR CHASE SCENE EVER)and the twists and turns  and even the theme song....everything is pure magnificence. <br />Oh man. Get  this movie. Love this movie. Cherish this movie and then watch it again and  again. <br />Never before have you seen the things you'll see in this movie.  NEVER. <br />I fear that any review I give will be more convoluted and  uninforming than actually watching this movie. So that is what you must do.  I guarantee you will be grinning from ear to ear and dancing that happy  dance you dance when you discover a film as good as this one....<br />thank  your lucky stars...
B00003CXAA|5.0|Michaelangelo Antonioni's &quot;Blow up&quot; is about a photographer not  being able to understand wheather a murder had occured or not. Coppola's  film is about the same, only here he is a surveilance guy, but in both  films (as in De-Palma's &quot;Blow Out&quot;, a stated take off on  &quot;Blow Up&quot;) the philosophical question rises: &quot;Can we count  on our senses to help us grasp what's real and what's not?&quot;. And out  of all three mentioned pictures, Coppola's does it best.
0451169514|5.0|It ranks as one of my three favorite books. The characters are heartwrenching and the clear look at human nature is almost mystical in its clarity. This book is super scary. Pennywise is really really creepy.  Unforgettable.
6305358613|4.0|By now, everyone is cognizant of the fact that this movie is not historically accurate.  However, since this movie is clearly intended as a character study and not a documentary, the &quot;dramatic license&quot;  taken by director Shekhar Kapur is not as heinous as the purists would lead  you to believe.  Most of the critics of this film seem to think that this  lack of historical accuracy will deter people from learning more about  Elizabeth I.  However, I believe that the complete opposite is true.  In  fact, I think that any high school or even college professor teaching  Elizabethean History should use this movie as a springboard for discussion  about the monarch and her era.  <br />     For those who are not as concerned  about attention to historical detail, this movie is a must-see because of  Cate Blanchett's riveting performance . . .count me among the reviewers who  think she was robbed of the Academy award.  In addition, the cinematography  and art direction are splendid.  All in all, a movie worth adding to your  collection.
034538072X|5.0|Definitive proof that the British monarchy has always had too much money and too little sense. I loved all the details of daily life and cuisine. As for the length, I wish it was longer. These ladies deserve every word written about lives  spent mostly in the shadow of a greedy monomaniac
B000001GLK|5.0|This recording is the top recording I have ever heard.  With the possible exception of Murry Perehia, I have never heard such poetic expression.  I have heard four other sets of the concertos played and this is still my  favorite.
6302054982|5.0|OH MY GOD! This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! Way better than the Godfather, since it didn't romanticize the mafia. Goodfellas shows what mobsters really are: viscious thugs who don't give a damn about anyone  but themselves. Anyone who won't watch this movie is missing out.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I know everyone has heard it, and I will say it again:  American Beauty is incredible.  Very rarely does a movie take a simple concept and create a vast and complex array of characters and their emotions.  The acting,  cinematography, script and direction are all breathtaking.  This movie  touches on a world where few can take you:  into the simplistic beauty of  everything around you.  This film has actually changed the way I look at  things, and has made me notice things I never have before.  Kevin Spacey's  performance shows his incredible range of emotional states, and all of them  are convincing.  The chemistry between Thora Birch and Wes Bently is  thorough and flows nicely, creating some charming and moving scenes.   American Beauty is an American classic.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is the finest album ever created, bar none.  Anyone that has the audacity to tell you that this isn't one of the classic albums of all time is an egotistical know-it-all who thinks that insulting it somehow makes  their opinions more important.  Music doesn't get any better than this.
B00000BKE0|2.0|When this album came out it hammered the final nails into the coffin of the NWOBHM. It simply could not stand up to the massive albums coming out at the time from American bands like Slayer and Megadeth. After releasing  two albums with a decidedly bloated euro-metal sound (keyboards and guitar  synth), this album meant to hail a return to Maiden's denim and leather  days of yore. But without the wailing emo solos of Adrian Smith, and the  addition of Janick Gers (who is a great guitar player in his own right, but  couldn't manage to break out of blazing through boring bluesy runs) Maiden  churned out a bland slab of vinyl. As much as I loved Maiden in the day,  they failed their American audience at a crucial point when speed metal was  all too happy to step in and take the heavy metal crown.
0375420525|4.0|Although this is not a conventional horror story by any means it did give me the willies in several places. I found it tough sledding at first but then gradually the thing started taking me over and the characters assumed palpability in my mind. Almost the best thing (and certainly the scariest) in the book is the very end (spoiler). House of Leaves is also quite good on the way photographers think.<br />Among the more noteworthy features of this book is its bizarre, inventive typography. As the characters get lost in geometry, the reader is forced to turn the book upside down and sideways and flip backwards and forwards and a host of other things beside. It's almost stupidly literal, but the odd thing is that it works, or at least it did for me. I finished the book with the sense of waking up from a dream -- a pleasurably creepy one.
B0000024SD|5.0|It's possibly the greatest album title in all of rock history: Bringing It All Back Home. It's gotta be close, at least - think about all the wonderful connotations it carries along with it, the sense of return,  recapturing of roots, integration of musical forms, etc. And the album  deserves a title that grandiose, even if there are at least three songs on  here that ain't that great (the nondescript rockers \\"Outlaw  Blues\\" and \\"On The Road Again\\" and the groaner \\"Gates  Of Eden\\").     Christ, though, other than those? EVERYTHING IS  MARVELOUS. I fully mean it when I say that you could (and should) make a  greatest hits collection out of this album alone. \\"Subterranean  Homesick Blues\\" is THE original white rock/rap fusion, and it was as  revolutionary as any song could be: free association in lyrics was  completely alien to rock until the first few seconds of \\"Johnny's in  the basement mixing up the medicine.\\" And while the  \\"electricity\\" is subdued in the sense that there aren't that many  rave-ups (but I sure count the protest broadside of \\"Maggie's  Farm\\" and the gut-busting \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream,\\" which  is literally the funniest he EVER got on record), it's alive in the sense  that the other songs are *vibrant.* \\"She Belongs To Me\\" features  one of the few memorable MELODIES Dylan wrote coupled with really sublime  lyrics, and \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" is almost as good.    And here's a paradox to chew on: Dylan may have used a guitar made out of something other than wood for the first time on Bringing It All Back Home, but it's on second half of this album where he created the best acoustic songs of  his career.      All of the acoustic songs are timeless - all except for \\"Gates Of Eden.\\" I'm going to stand on this one: that song is a  lyrical embarrassment. Now I'll allow quite a lot of lyrical idiosyncrasy from Mr. Zimmerman, as I feel he's earned the latitude, (Did I hear a \\"cowboy mouth\\" in \\"Sad-Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands?\\") but the verses of this oneare really ugly: \\"Motorcycle black madonna two-wheeled gypsy rides?\\" Come on, if Jon Anderson threw that one out  at us on The Yes Album we'd crucify him for it.  It's like he picked random images out of a hat and threw 'em together, hoping the \\"Gates Of Eden\\" motif would mask the fact that they didn't have any coherence. The tune is certainly pleasant, but the lyrics are a no-go(\\"grey flannel dwarves?\\"), especially when they're surrounded with alternately either some of the most incisive or most poetic  lyrics Dylan ever wrote.     Going for the incisive is the utterly flooring  \\"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding).\\" Words cannot describe this  track's quietly throbbing motive force, chiefly because to do so would  require me to quote all the words. Suffice to say it's a fount of brilliant  catch-phrases and criticisms of American culture (\\"He not busy being  born is busy dying,\\" \\"Money doesn't talk it swears,\\" both of  which have made it into the popular lexicon) lashed onto one of the most  driving acoustic guitar riffs I've heard. And for the poetic side, there's  \\"Mr. Tambourine Man,\\" of course, and my personal favorite (one of  my all-time Dylan favs), \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue.\\" Wow.  I've seen people describe this as a nasty kissoff to his critics but I  don't get that at all. Instead, what I hear is stately dignity, from the first taut strum of his guitar to the lyrical harmonica solo, and those unforgettable lyrics...there's such a sad azure tone to the whole  song, a certain majesty. The perfect ending to a timeless album of revolutions.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I don't normally review music, but I liked this cd so much that I had to.  It is very rare that you come across an album without a weak track on it, but that is what Blink 182 have given us with Enema of the State.  It's a  great album which will have you jumping all over the room, it offers a  mixture of tunes, which range from almost melancholy (Adams Song) to out  right hyperactive (All the Small Things).  The classic Blink humour is  still present and as for &quot;sell outs&quot; isn't that just a term that  seems to be used when a band become successful, by spotty people who only  think music is cool if no one else has heard of it?  <br />If you like the  work of Green Day and Offspring (before they went cheesy)or are just simply  a fan of rock then I am certain that you will love this album.  BUY IT!   BUY IT!  BUY IT!
B000002OYB|4.0|When I first saw this album and saw the words &quot;Songs by Jim Steinman&quot; missing from it, my first thought was, &quot;uh-oh&quot;!  But with the help of two Steinman songs (Original Sin and Alone in the  Dark) and three Dianne Warren songs (I'd Lie For You, Not A Dry Eye in The  House, and If This is The Last Kiss), it has a great deal of talent  supporting it.<br />One reviewer commented that Diane Warren is no Jim  Steinman, which is true, but she is still very talented.  Meat Loaf does  need Steinman, but he does have some life without him!<br />The best songs are  of course the 5 songs by Steinman and Warren I listed above, two of which  appeared on his Very Best Of&quot; album in 1998.  Sammy Haggar's  &quot;Amnesty is Granted&quot; is far from great, but is interesting.  This  album reminds me much of Meat's 1984 album, &quot;Bad Attitude, which is  his only other good album that is not entirely the creation of  Steinman.<br />These two works prove that over the years Meatloaf has grown as  an artist and has perhaps even learned from Steinman!  ALL IN ALL, A GOOD  SOLID ALBUM THAT IS A MUST FOR ALL MEATLOAF, STEINMAN, AND WARREN FANS. One  thing overlooked on about this album is the successful teamwork of Steinman  and Warren, even though it is indirect since neither produces it.<br />I would  like to see Jim Steinman and Dianne Warren work together on a future  Meatloaf album with more titles written by each and produced by Steinman.
0790739909|4.0|The boy-meets-girl formula can only take a film so far as it has been shot in every conceivable combination.  I would have chosen someone different than Meg Ryan for the lead female, if only for a bit larger thrust to  suspend belief in reality.  Cage did a fine job of restraint, not  overwhelming the poignant lines.  This story captured my imagination with  the scene where Dr. Rice is eating the pear, and Seth replies that he  doesn't know how it tastes to her...<br />I would recommend this video to  those in need of a dose of the fairytale to ward of the burdens of reality  for two hours.
B00000IPAX|1.0|This is one of the most insipid collections of nauseating pop ditties I can think of.  Listen to the lyrics of &quot;All The Small Things&quot; and it becomes clear that they are emulating the boy groups, since the subject  matter is something boy groups sing about all the time.  When they aren't  trying to attract swooning teenyboppers, they display scatological and  sexual fixations, which once again shows a lack of intelligence - but what  did you expect, it's Blink 182.  Several attempts at humor are made  throughout the album, which would have left an impact if the lines were  actually funny and weren't merely a ploy to get noticed.  All of the songs  on the album sound very much alike, with the exception of &quot;Adam's  Song&quot;, an improvement over the rest of their material which focuses on  what goes through the mind of a suicidal teenager.  Other than that, and  unless you are buying the album to be &quot;cool and accepted&quot; by your  Carson Daly-loving peers, I definitely wouldn't recommend this album, and  would instead suggest Bad Religion and Pennywise for those looking for true  punk.
0684872153|5.0|I remember it was only a few months ago that I was chatting online in an AOL book chat (Bookaccino at TBR) when everyone was constantly raving about this book. I felt left out of the conversations since I did not read the book. Now, I understand what everyone was raving about. Angela's Ashes  touches the hearts of us all with the tales of his father's alcoholism and  how his family struggled to survive. Who could not to relate to the story  of a little boy trying to grow up and be a man? While reading this story I  didn't know whether to laugh or cry.<br /> My favorite part of the book is  when Frankie hears his first bit of Shakespeare; \\"I do believe, induced by  potent circumstances, that thou art my enemy.\\" It made me think of the  first time I saw a real Shakespearean production of A Midsummer's Night  Dream. I was awestruck by the beauty and majesty of the Shakespearean  language. \\"It's like having jewels in my mouth when I say the words,\\"  McCourt writes. When reading this passage I was smiling thinking, \\"Wow,  that's right!\\"<br />While it is almost impossible to completely relate with a  character in a book, it is equally impossible not to know somewhat what the  character must be going through. I find that Frank's story is very  emotional. Yet McCourt does not blame anyone in his memoir. In a way, he  just seems to say, &quot;Sure life was hard but life is life. What do you  expect?&quot; It is this attitude perhaps that makes the memoir more  enjoyable to me. Whereas some writers might directly or indirectly use  their memoirs to blame their problems on others, McCourt just tells his  story.
B00000JCOV|5.0|With 3 drummers, how can you possibly go wrong!  Well, you can, pretty easily, but Slipknot managed to use each of them in such a way that they compliment the entire band to the fullest. I personally love a big band,  especially one with lots of drumer (being a drummer myself). The fast paced  music really gets your blood pumping. Their music is repetitious, but is  also excellent. In all the repetition of rock and metal music these days,  its nice to actually see a band where it sounds good. An excellent cd. If  you like KoRn, you're gonna love Slipknot.
0679746048|5.0|Girl, Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen was an excellent memoir. I found it to be easy to read and understand. I finished it in two days. The speaker in this memoir is an easy character to relate to. The memoir is a short, hilarious portrayal of an institutionalized teenager as an adult looking  back on her two years at the hospital. While committed at the hospital she  still experiences some of the same things \\"normal\\" teenagers go through.  The memoir also includes copies of her actual records from the hospital.<br />  The whole idea that anyone could easily be classified as \\"crazy\\" -  from someone standing with you to wait for the bus to even the ice cream  man -- was interesting to me. I found this memoir to be very insightful. It  is interesting how a vast majority of teenagers go through a mental illness  at some point in their lives. Kaysen makes the point that people tend to  delude themselves into believing that they are normal and that no one in  their families can possibly be crazy. It made me actually wonder what could  really be classified as \\"normal\\" anyway?<br />  I found the fact that  Kaysen tried to kill herself to destroy a certain aspect of her character  interesting. Everyone had parts of their personalities that they'd rather  not have. Kaysen chose a drastic was of dealing with it whereas I  personally try to hide it. They are both self-destructive behaviors but who  is to judge what is right or wrong? It is natural to try to battle with  your \\"darker side.\\"
0140067477|5.0|I've read this book at least 10 times and each time I've had to buy it again. I lend out my copy to people and never see it again. It is the best book I've ever read and it helps me to focus myself. I already possesed some of the principles of Tao in my life when I first read the book several  years ago, I just never knew the name of it and I'd studied Taoism before.  Hoff combines Pooh and his world with Taoism in ways that make me wonder  why I couldn't have seen it myself! When I want other people to read the  book,and they are skeptical of the impact it has, I let them read the  Foreword and tell them that it will brighten their day...the actual book  will change their life. And after they read both, they wholeheartedly agree  and refuse to return my copy! Buy this book and read it and you'll wonder  why it took you so long to find it. I recommend it without reservation.
0783241569|5.0|The movie Notting Hill is a wonderful romantic movie. Julia Roberts is perfect at her role (she should be, seeing as she's playing another actress!) The screenwriters have really brought alive the true sense of  being an actress in this great movie. If you're in to romantic comedies at  all, this is the one to see!
6305807086|5.0|When I first sat down to watch this movie, I was curious and anxious. When the movie started, I was a bit skeptical- just a bit. But I have to say that before I saw the movie, I knew I'd come out loving it and that's  exactly what happened. The movie is odd but at the same time it's so  ingenious. All the characters were really great; the story ended up to be  touching and I still laugh at the monkey's past and how he was able to  break out of his fear of it. The movie was so good, I was afraid people  would not appreciate it just because it's not like the big film productions  of today and just because of it's simply odd plot. Some people turned their  noses up when I told them how much I had enjoyed it but I'm glad to see so  many other people have enjoyed it as well. You have to go in with an open  mind- if you don't then you'll HATE this movie. I highly appreciated this  movie. It was great.
0790738074|5.0|The movie version of The Music Man is quite a gem.  It stars the flawless performance of Robert Preston as Harold Hill and features the beautiful singing and intelligent acting of Shirley Jones.  One of the reasons that  this movie is quite a favorite of mine is because it is so faithful to the  script.  Many of the movie versions of the Broadway musical classics have  paled or have suffered in translation to the screen.   The movie version of  The Music Man is quite close to the original and contains a gem of a song  called &quot;Being in Love&quot;, which replaced the stage version's  &quot;My White Knight&quot;  (both songs are first rate).  The soundtrack  is also nicely done, even though &quot;It's You&quot; (sung by the Buffalo  Bills) seems to be missing.    The Music Man is a must for any movie  musical collection.
0380804557|5.0|I'm probably one of the rare few who believe that Stardust isbetter than Neverwhere.  Nevertheless, I think Stardust is a much moretightly woven story than Neverwhere.  Every so often, Gaiman returnsto the same interesting and multi-dimensional characters that he introduced at the start of the story.  It's not just a band of heroes against some villains.  There was Madame Semele, the bird-woman-slave, the Lilim, the sons of the Lord of Stormhold, etc. and they're all important characters that are not just villain or hero.  Because of this, I was endeared to the characters and found the story to be more engaging.  The plot twists and folds upon itself wonderfully unlike Neverwhere which is just a linear plot, with one adventure after another.  Finally, the ending of Stardust is unbelievably superior to the ending of Neverwhere.  .....<br />Some complain that Stardust is boring, slow-paced, and childish in its style.  But looking at the character development and plot of Stardust, I found that there was much to appreciate.  The language and style that Gaiman used was perfect for the story because the setting is Faerie, a fantasy land. In the Underground, one can be dark and suspenseful and gothic.  In other epic fantasies with wizards and dragons, one can be grand and majestic.  But not in Faerie.<br />All in all, Stardust was a wonderfully written story that really touched me.
B000002KD9|5.0|This is the album that really put Neil Young on the map as a solo artist.  Simply put, there is not a bad moment on the record.  Classic songs abound including the achingly beautiful title track and the overtly political  &quot;Southern Man.&quot;  Young's sound here is generally closer to his  folkie side.  The production is so good that even today it sounds as though  it has just been released.  The quintessential Neil Young album.
157492589X|5.0|Playing the Texas Ranger turned cattleman, Gus McRae, this is unquestionably Robert Duval's greatest acting achievement. Had this adaptation of Larry McMurtry's award-winning novel been made for the Big  Screen rather than television, it would have garnered very major Academy  Award for that year. It's also every bit as good as the book, if not  better.<br />In my opinion, this is the finest vision of the mythical American  West ever put on film. It has everything: flawed good guys, horrific bad  guys, Indian fights, shootouts, the hooker with a Heart of Gold, rustlers,  a danger-filled cattle drive, hangings, lost loves, loyalty of friendship,  cowardice, bravery, tragedy, drama, humor. The cynic will say that the film  is simply a compilation of clich&eacute;s. However, everything is tied together so  wonderfully by Duval and a magnificent supporting cast, spectacular  cinematography, authentic period costuming, and a soundtrack to knock your  socks off, that it's hard to object even if you realize your emotions are  being shamelessly manipulated.<br />I've plugged the video tape of this epic  into the VCR more times than I can count. If you've never seen it, rent it  this weekend, have a box of Kleenex handy, and indulge your senses.

0375501851|5.0|This is a first class debut novel, which has made the news due to the huge advance, which the author received - a six-figure number. So, the question seems to be: is White Teeth worth all that money? The answer has to be YES.<br />White Teeth is a brilliant novel, superbly confident in its execution.  It starts off in 1975, the year of the author's birth, with the attempted  suicide of Archibald Jones. Anyone who was born in 1970s Britain cannot  fail but identify with the characters and events in this book. If you can  recall the VW badge craze, then this is the book for you. However, this is  not just a novel for the younger generation, for there is at least one  extended family in White Teeth, each member of which is brought vividly to  life. There's Archibald Jones and Samed Iqbal, who first meet in a British  tank in 1945, and who then meet up again thirty years later to start the  families featured within White Teeth. There's the brilliant and comic  portrayal of the aged Hortense Bowden, an avid Jehovah's Witness, who keeps  waiting for the end of the world.<br />Zadie Smith's novel has been described  as Dickensenian, but I think there's a touch of Thackeray in there too. The  author mocks her characters, and parodies them, but she also has a lot of  compassion for them. No one, in the world of White Teeth, is beyond  redemption. Zadie Smith's characters are truly vibrant. Take Samed Iqbal  and his troubles with 'slapping the salami'. As a reader, you begin to  wonder how Zadie Smith has such insight into the male mind and universe,  because it rings so true.<br />For anyone embarking on a Cultural Studies  course, this novel is a must. Throw away your textbooks with their dry  statistics! One of White Teeth's main themes is the mix of cultures in  North London, from the Bengali Iqbals, to the archetypal Englishman Archie  Jones, to the half-Jamaican Bowdens, and a slight smattering of the Irish.  The novel maps these characters as they try to live out their years in a  world which is losing religion and tradition. Samed kidnaps one of his sons  to be brought up as a proper Bengali back home, while his other son,  Millat, flirts with girls and joins the fundamentalist Keepers of the  Eternal and Victorious Islamic Nation (KEVIN - they've got an acronym  problem).<br />History and fate are intermingled in this novel. Hortense  Bowden's apocalyptic vision of the future is indivisibly linked to the  aftershocks of her birth. Samed can't stop boring people with tales of his  illustrious ancestor, the rebellious Mangal Pande. Irie Jones seeks to  visit her family's home of Jamaica. And Joyce Chalfen sees genius in each  Chalfen portrait, whilst Joshua Chalfen literally joins up with FATE.  Archie Jones, who leaves most decisions to the flick of a coin, also finds  that History has a nasty shock in store for him. However, the future's  present here also, with Marcus Chalfen's work on genetics forming a pivotal  part of the plot.<br />Like BBC TV's 'Our Friends in the North', White Teeth  is divided up amongst a handful of years relevant to the characters. So,  you can wallow in nostalgia as you see the Berlin Wall fall down once more,  relive of the turmoil of that October 1987 storm, and remind yourself of  the Bradford protest against The Satanic Verses. Salman Rushdie's review of  White Teeth is the only bit of marketing on the front cover, and indeed,  Zadie Smith has been compared favourably with Rushdie.<br />There are quite a  few pop culture allusions scattered throughout the novel, but I doubt that  these will date, as they tend to be of the immortal kind (references to  'Taxi Driver', and 'Goodfellas'). The plot of another gangster movie,  'Miller's Crossing', seems to reflect Archie Jones' dilemma. But please  don't point any tedious accusations of theft in Zadie Smith's direction.  She has her own, extremely witty, voice as a writer, and White Teeth comes  very much from her perspective. It seems that Zadie Smithhas been writing  this novel for a very long time: witness the similarity of the characters  and story in `Mrs. Begum's Son and the Private Tutor', a story short she  wrote for the Cambridge May Anthologies in 1997.<br />There are only a few  jarring notes. Smith has a tendency to write aesthetic words such as  'monstropolous', when there's really no need to do it, other than maybe  showing off. Having said that, you try looking up `monstropolous' in any  online dictionary, and you'll have drawn a blank. But if you look up  references to the word on the net, then it points all the way to Zora Neale  Hurston's `Their Eyes were Watching God'. Hurston's writing was  rediscovered and promoted by Alice Walker in the 70s, and this tome is  credited by many for being the first novel in which Southern U.S. Blacks  are portrayed as being independent from White society. Once you consider  the provenance of `monstropolous', there can be no possible objection to  Zadie Smith's prose. What had once seemed intrusive, now has a power all  its own. If a single word could tell a story, then `monstropolous' is it.  My first impression was wrong. There are no discordant notes. The music is  sublime.e Smith has been writing  this novel for a very long time: witness the similarity of the characters  and story in `Mrs. Begum's Son and the Private Tutor', a story short she  wrote for the Cambridge May Anthologies in 1997. <br />There are only a few  jarring notes.

B0000028P8|5.0|Starting with the MTV Unplugged EP critics started being kinder to Carey's releases.  A strange phenomenon, perhaps, but this EP did tap into many good things in Carey's artistic makeup that she would eventually lose over  subsequent years.<br />First, her gospel influence.  With backup singers (most  notable being duet partner Trey Lorenz) who match her vocal prowess note  for note, Carey manages to evoke much more of a communal spirit on this EP  than on other albums, where hers is often the only voice heard on a song.   Second, spontaneity.  Carey's studio albums (especially since Music Box)  are so crammed with studio polish that it's good to hear her in a live  setting for once, intimate and relaxed instead of overblown and bombastic.   Finally, the song selection and arrangements.  This EP is like many others  in the Unplugged series in reducing certain formulas to basics and thus  enhancing an artist's sound through elegant simplicity.  Piano and live  drums, live backup singers and bass...a nicely spare accompaniment to  Carey's singing, which is more facile and expressive here than on any other  release.<br />And the song selection is nice, with beautifully voiced Jackson  5 cover &quot;I'll Be There&quot; being the flagship hit.  The Carole King  collaboration &quot;If It's Over&quot; sounds perfectly at home in this  small setting, and this EP/unplugged version of &quot;Make It Happen&quot;  beats the studio version on Emotions by a mile, sounding joyful and  spontaneous instead of asthmatic and timid as on the original.  And then  &quot;Can't Let Go&quot; acquires a closeness that eludes the original and  makes the song sound more emotional, like sitting in the living room of the  broken-hearted one listening to her sobbing.  The lyrics may remain the  high-school ramblings that Carey never outgrew, but the feeling is vastly  more authentic.<br />An essential addition to a Carey collection because,  looking over her entire catalogue, it's the only time she took a step back  and discovered something wonderful in minimalism and spontaneity.  After  this and 1993's Music Box, it's all calculated reinventions.
B000002568|5.0|Absolutely the most stunning solo debut in jazz history.  Heavyweight assistance in the form of some of the best of the seventies fusion giants, the technical and emotional mastery of Jaco, the aggressive yet melodic  style that's a bit more balls-out than earlier work with Metheny.  But  there's clearly reason for the confidence, even arrogance with which this  man infused his lighting fast arpeggios (and on a FRETless bass? )  It's a  must have for any fan of not just the bass, not just jazz, but music.   There's something for everyone on it.
B00003CWN3|5.0|Boys Don't Cry garnered excellent reviews across the board, so it was with incredibly high expectations that I walked into the theatre.  As it turns out, I think I held this film to much higher standards than usual and found  some problematic areas.<br />That said, I still find Boys Don't Cry to be a  powerful, touching, and harrowing story of misunderstanding, ignorance, and  love, with one of the most powerfully Quixotic characters to have graced  the screen in ages.  Hilary Swank and director Kimberly Peirce chose the  right approach by exploring thoroughly the joy Brandon experiences at  his/her own transformation, making the tragedy at the end a moving  experience.  Dramatically the film sometimes gets too heavy-handed and it  is the light-fingered moments (Chloe Sevigny's Lana lying in bed with  girlfriends thinking back to her first seduction by Brandon; Lana and  Brandon sharing the excitement of moving away; Brandon watching Lana sing  karaoke) that really shine.<br />The film does show off technically, with a  flashy editing style, unsubtle use of music and, again, moments that are  almost delirious in their heavy-handed presentation of events and  characters.  However, Boys Don't Cry still manages to stand on its own  thanks to the utter sincerity of the performances, total sympathy with its  characters, and thematic depth.

B0000028VT|4.0|In retrospect Music Box was the beginning of Mariah Carey's slide towards market-tailored material, the loss of the artistic soul that she was beginning to show, the end result being her overvocalized, soulless hits  from 1995 on.<br />But Music Box still contains strong moments.  Opening track  &quot;Dreamlover&quot; was a massive hit, a semi-interesting dance groove,  melodically unmemorable, but far less offensive or cutesy than  &quot;Fantasy&quot; or &quot;Honey&quot;.  And Carey still excelled at  ballads:  The R&amp;B track &quot;Never Forget You&quot; sounds great, and  her cover of Nilsson's &quot;Without You&quot; almost comes close to the  original.  The Ham/Evans song is so catchy that it's hard to miss, and even  if Carey's rendition lacks the quiet elegance of Nilsson's delivery, it  does provide a suitable opportunity for Carey to cut loose her voice.  And  &quot;Hero&quot; is the most unselfconsciously anthemic song in the Carey  catalogue, not in a bad way, and even if it's schmaltzy and obvious, it's  still ear candy.<br />But other songs fare far less well.  &quot;Music  Box&quot; is positively anemic and lyrically incredibly inept; &quot;All  I've Ever Wanted&quot; is a shameless ripoff of the retch-inducing Whitney  Houston megahit &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, right down to those  senseless yowls that emote nothing but aim to shatter eardrums and glasses  alike.  And it manages to sound even worse than Houston's song.  And  &quot;Anytime You Need a Friend&quot; is sleep-inducing feel-good material,  along the lines of &quot;Make It Happen&quot; from Emotions.<br />If you can,  find the Japanese import version of Music Box.  My second copy of this  album (I was a very big fan in the early '90s) has two very good Carey  ballads as bonus tracks, which appeared as B-sides to the first two singles  from Music Box, &quot;Dreamlover&quot; and &quot;Hero&quot;.  &quot;Do You  Think of Me&quot; is a breathy, very sexy ballad, almost carnal in itsevocation of desire; and &quot;Everything Fades Away&quot; invites back  those sorely missed gospel vocals -- though the lyrics are pretty plain,  the sonic punch of the track is great, and the melodies sure and catchy.   That package I'd bought also contained a mini photo booklet and nicer  packaging than the normal editions.
0790729393|3.0|I caught &quot;Sleepers&quot; on TV a few weeks ago finally after wondering how good it was.  It was directed by Barry Levinson and had a great cast that included Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, and Kevin Bacon:  all of which are favorites of mine.  As good as their performances are  though they really do not have much screen time.  In fact, no one really  does since the film deals with flashbacks and present day material.  It's  about a group of kids in Hell's Kitchen that pull a prank that turns out to  be deadly and are sent to reform school where they are abused by sadistic  guards (Kevin Bacon's darkest performance).  Two of the kids find him years  later and murder him and then the other two fix thet trial.  Robert DeNiro  gives a really good performance as a priest who is very close to the kids.   It's a really dark film though and it seems to drag at parts.  The begining  seemed to open up like all the New York gangster films open up with  childhood flashbacks that are starting to all be the same.  It basically  has the same opening as &quot;Bronx Tale&quot; or &quot;GoodFellas&quot;  yet it is much longer.  Though Levinson's directing is top notch as are the  performances.  It was a very bold film esp. for Kevin Bacon who gave a  pretty evil performance.  It's very interesting too once it gets rolling I  just wish it happend sooner than it did.
B00000K19E|5.0|There's not much left to say about this movie that hasn't already been said, so I'll just say what I love so much about this movie, specifically the DVD.<br />1)The sound!   The sound effects in this movie absolutely raise  the bar for any action or sci-fi movie from here on out.  My personal  favorite is the shell casings, in EVERY scene they are absolutely crystal  clear and really bring home the impact of the different gun  battles.<br />2)The effects!  Similar to the sound, there will be a new genre  of special effects spawning from what they came up with for this movie  (there's already evidence of this out there, anyone see the preview for the  new IMAX Michael Jordan movie?).<br />On the whole the story is great, with  some minor flaws in the logic behind the matrix that I  won't bother with  because this movie absolutely ROCKS.<br />Go out and buy a worthy surround  sound setup, *get this DVD* and turn it up loud enough to bother the  neighbors...  'nuff said.
B00000DG1R|5.0|Before I bought this CD, I had &quot;Decade&quot; and when I saw that they had another one out, I bought it and sold the other. I like this one better than &quot;Decade&quot; because &quot;New Moon On Monday&quot; was on this  CD as well as &quot;Electric Barbarella(sic?)&quot;, which I had only heard  on Jay Leno.<br />But there is a little flaw, and that is the fact that the  intro to &quot;Rio&quot; was cut. Other than that, the rest of the CD is  okay. I know that some other songs were cut, but I don't notice the  difference.<br />All the songs bring back memories of when I heard them when  they were hits, especially &quot;Hungry Like...&quot;, and  &quot;Notorious&quot;.
B000031WD9|5.0|I pre-ordered the unrated version of this movie because I have not laughed as hard as I did at this movie very often and I wanted to see what they had to cut out.  I was let down as far as extra scenes (no, there's no more  Nadia than in the original), there's not much more and I personally don't  think they should have cut the extra scenes anyhow.  <br />What's great about  having this on DVD is that you can just sit down and watch a couple of the  best scenes.  I mean, this is not a movie that will loose a lot if you  don't watch it all the way through.  It'll be great for parties and  whenever you want to laugh your head off.  You need to be a teenager at  heart, because the comedy is squarely aimed at the coming of age group, but  the beauty of this movie is that people like me that have moved on can  still relate.<br />Run out and get this if in your face, juvenile comedy  amusues you as much as it does me.

B00001U0E1|4.0|This is a great compromise movie, a chick flick that a guy can love.  I found this to be a very funny story, with one of the best Shakespeare's that has ever or will ever play the part.  I really enjoyed all of the  cast, especially Ben Affleck, who didn't show up much, but was a great  small part of what made this a fun movie.  I still don't know about the  Oscar thing for the Queen, she looked good, but that's makeup and costume,  not acting.<br />If you need a movie that will appeal to anyone, here it is.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Forget the water. After seeing \\"Jaws,\\" you'll be afraid to go in the shower! At the ripe old age of 26, Steven Spielberg managed to redefine the economics of Hollywood forever (ushering the era of the Summer Blockbuster) AND create an all-time classic at the same time. Even without \\"E.T.,\\" the Indiana Jones movies, \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" this film alone would make Spielberg's resume significantly better than that of 95% of Hollywood directors (I checked my figures of course).    A quiet New England summer town is terrorized by an enormous Great White Shark whose appetite for human flesh seems to know no limits. The new police chief (Roy Scheider), bending to pressure from the Mayor and City Council, fails to close the beaches even though he knows there is a shark out there. As a result of his negligence, a little boy is killed. Racked with guilt, he becomes obsessed with killing the shark and immerses himself in the study of the animals, aided by an icthyologist from the mainland (Richard Dreyfuss) who comes to provide expert advice.    When a smaller shark is caught and mistakenly believed to be the aggressor, the Mayor orders the beaches to stay open for the 4th of July weekend, with predictably disastrous results. The cop and the scientist must then team up with a salty local fisherman (Robert Shaw) to go hunt and kill the shark, which results in an exhilirating battle of will, wits and guts.    The three leads all deliver unforgettable performances, but the real star of the show is Spielberg, who deftly plays on the fears of the audience to create a thriller worthy of Hitchcock (yes, I realize how original it is to bring this up when talking about this movie). Cranking up the suspense by more than a few notches is the classic, inspired soundtrack by John Williams.    Even the fact that the long-awaited appearance of the shark turns out to be something of a letdown does not detract from the overall effectiveness of the film. Spielberg manages to create an atmosphere so tense that the mere sight of the ocean is almost enough to make you jump out of your seat. Having seen it only on video, I can only imagine how chilling it must have been to watch this film in a movie theater. Not only does Spielberg trim away all the pedestrian melodrama from the novel, but the last act of the film, in which the three men hunt the shark (or is it the other way around?), once it kicks into overdrive, never lets up.    The subsequent appearance of \\"Star Wars\\" often makes people forget that the Blockbuster mentality was actually an aftermath of the success of \\"Jaws.\\" It's just as well, because this is a true classic, regardless of the bastardizing effect its box office had on Hollywood films. Spielberg has said that although he hated making the film, he loved planning the film, implying that the mere thought of scaring the bejesus out of the audience was an immensely enjoyable experience for him. Well, it shows, and for that we should all be grateful.
B00000JGHM|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater, I love this movie on DVD and I will continue to love this movie for all time.  Great story, great writing, great cast (make that AMAZING cast), one of the best shootouts ever done in  all of movie history and an intensity few movies can match.<br />The only  negative that I can think of, as far as the DVD goes, is that there is no  multi-angle for the shootout.  I've been waiting to try the multi-angle on  my player since the day I read about it in the manual and I thought that  this movie might be the one.  With the complexity of the shootout, I was  sure that they could manage a multi-angle section for me, but alas  no.<br />Other than that one complaint, this is a phenomenal DVD, with amazing  picture and the sound rivals that of The Matrix.<br />This one is going to  see some serious play time at my house.
0783226004|5.0|Other movies that have tried (and failed) to cover hacking/conspiracy theories have one fatal flaw.  Instead of trying to be entertaining, as movies should be; they take their cues from the mainstream media and try to  scare the audience to death with images of cival liberties being taken away  as fast as some on screen hacker can type into a not-so-secure government  database.  <br />Sneakers on the other hand shows us what the government(and  people pretending to be the government) is capable of through the eyes of  very entertaining yet somewhat believable characters in the industry.  From  a phone phreak to an ex cia man, their group covers the gambit in skills  and personalities.  Redford leads an allstar cast as a good looking social  engineer who talks his way past security in lieu of hacking.  Dan Akroyd  gives a performance unparalelled except maybe for his character in Gross  Pointe Blank.<br />So if you are in the mood for something completely  different from the Net, Conspiracy theory, and Masterminds, then this is  the movie for you.<br />Loved it, seen it uncountable times, just upgraded to  DVD version.

B00000J7JO|5.0|This is one of the few CDs I own that I can listen through the whole thing.  The lyrics, even though they sometimes don't make sense, are meaningful and Anthony's voice is really cool sounding.  The guitars are great sounding and the bass is, well, bass.  It's deep.  I like every song  on this CD, but my favorite is &quot;Get On Top.&quot; This CD is well  worth it.
B000002BBY|5.0|The second coming of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones apparently have already come and conquered.

As little brother  Liam belts out these tunes, even giving his older brother, Noel, a turn in  &quot;Don't Look Back in Anger&quot;, I have to realize that I have listen  to this album one too many times.

6305265666|4.0|600 people have said it well before me, so I won't go into details. This is a very charming movie that sometimes brought a smile to my face, and sometimes a tear to me eye. Well worth watching.<br />The DVD is nothing  special. The subtitles are thankfully below the movie (and I think would be  visible even on a wide screen TV, with the movie's aspect ratio of 2.35:1).  I listened to it on a mono TV, so can't comment about the surround quality.  There are no special features apart from the trailer. The root menu is  nice. It has some animation and has music playing, which already starts  drawing you into the mood of the movie. At least, it did for me.

6305078181|3.0|Frank Langella stars as the doomed Count and does a good job.  Dracula leaves his homeland and begins to terrorize a new community.  He falls for his real estate agent's love Mina.  It is up to Mr. Harker and his comrades  including Dr. Van Helsing to stop him, both from stealing away Mina, and  from spreading his vampiric plague to the world. <br />This version of Dracula  (much like Coppola's), is more of a dark romance than a horror film.  <br />With no features whatsoever it's hard to justify purchasing this DVD.   It is however, the only release of Langella's Dracula on the market on DVD  and I don't see a newer release coming soon.  The film's picture and sound  are fine, so for just the film it is a good purchase.
B000023X9W|5.0|The Rolling Stone review gives it 4.5 stars.  If you are not inclined yet to impulse buy this CD, read the review and then buy it.  I was lucky enough to be in Europe last week for its early release there.  Four days of  listening and it just keeps getting better.
630575067X|4.0|I saw A new Hope when I was six. It was my birthday and the hype of the movie was beginning a massive stride.  I HAD to see it.  My dad wanted to see something else but it was my birthday and he said ANY movie.  I was  enraptured beyond repair.<br />That being said let us look at how people are  most likely perceiving this movie. Can ANYTHING that was as revolutionary  and awe inspiring REPEAT that feat? No. People come to expect too much out  of it. Can anything affect you with the sense of wonder it did when you saw  it when you were 5-15? No. We are so much more impressionable when we are  younger and the wonder that A New Hope presented then was electrifying. All  of this being said I tried to go into the viewing of Episode One with as  little expectation as possible.  I came away with some sense of wonder.  I  wanted to see it immediately again. This one was also subtler in its  approach to the force and the political intrigues surrounding the  characters of the story.  It was not so insular as the previously released  movies. I, like many others thought Jar Jar was atrocious.  I understand  the marketing ploy but man!   He had somewhere in the vicinity of 60  minutes of screen time.  GADS!  Isn't this about ANAKIN?  For the record  the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is the presence of Jar Jar. I  cannot go too much into why I think this movie deserved more credit than it  got by `fans' without spoiling it for the 4 people who have not seen it. I  think that people had very unrealistic expectations from this movie. It was  a great film on its own right and had more depth, story wise, than A New  Hope. A New Hope was plot formula `A'. Peasant boy becomes king. Think  about it.

0812580346|5.0|This book was excellent!  I don't normally buy sci-fi. I am strictly a sword and sorcery type of girl. But this book was given to me by a well meaning friend and I wasn't disappointed. The science lost me once and a while, but really the story line kept me interested. I would suggest this  book to anyone sci-fi lover or not. I think that the author took some huge  leaps with the science, but over all I think that was to be expected with  this tpye of story. I enjoied the characters as well. Again I say that this  was a book well worth reading.
B00000J7J4|3.0|I've loved Carlos Santana since I learned to play guitar by copying his licks on Abraxas 30 years ago.  He was great then and he's great now but after all the changes in his career, the horns, becoming Devadip, etc., and  now he's doing the same idioms and licks as on the best Abraxas cuts.  So  what's new?  What's new is that he's assembled a terrific group of artists  and writers to create this work, but Carlos himself is merely being his  old, great self.  I guess it's to his credit that he's still doing it.   After all, how many players on the Woodstock album are even still alive?
B00002Z88D|5.0|At first I thought this concept was a joke while browsing at my local Best Buy, (a group like Metallica playing with the San Fransisco Symphony Orchestra?), though it did sound like a cool idea. After I heard &quot;No  Leaf Clover&quot; on my local radio station (KROQ), I knew I had to get  this CD. It's got all (or most of) of Metallica's best songs, like  &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, The Call of Ktulu (one of my all time  favorite instrumentals), The Memory Remains, the only song that it didnt  include, that I think they should've was &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;,  but other than that, I think anyone who's curious about this CD should try  it - you'll like it.
B00000I924|2.0|I love Jeff Beck's music, and he has been influential to me in the 35 years I've played rock.  But this album is just a collection of noodling, nothing more.  I've listened to it several times trying to read between the  lines but now put it away for good.  Turn it all the way up and play it at  a party, but this sounds like someone hid a microphone in his practice room  on a rainy day when he'd really rather have been playing soccer outside.
0517122707|5.0|I loved the book! After reading what everyone else commented on, no one really talked about how Ignatius Reilly was the true way we all should live our lives.  We have forgotten the true vision of the American dream, we need to come back to our senses.  The American dream isn't about  materialistic wealth (look at Ignatius).  But he had one thing many of us  don't embrace, self-satisfaction.  We are caught up in a world of fast  cars, beautiful people, and lots of money.  We need to remind ourselves  that we need to be content with ourselves before anything else.  In my  opinion, Ignatius is beautiful in his own mysterious ways.  JDK
630349255X|5.0|The stark contrast between the professional film critic review and the consumers worshipful praise may tell you that this experience is unbound by convention but breaks no conventions , is political in the eye of some  without a single political comment, immense in scope but at the  infintesimal center of each heart that beats. I have been to but a few of  the regions of this film and feel I have been to the unknown places by the  sights ,music and enviormentals that transports the omnicient eye of my  soul. A critic sees only a travelogue. An American will see how much  resolution their machines will render while watching the 1 1/2 hour film. A  human being will be released from the shackles of time.
B00003CWL5|3.0|I am not sure about this film--I had the same feeling about 'Eyes Wide Shut'--a film with so much hype should have induced a 'love it' or 'hate it' reaction. One of the ways to judge a film is if the images or visual  and narrative metaphors resonate over time. In the end EWS faded and I  decided that Kubrik got stuck in the 70s.<br />I suspect that American Beauty  will also fade, but I am now fascinated by the notion of mainstream  subversion of American icons. This is the usual territory of alternative  cinema or animation (Southpark and the Simpsons), both of which are more  subtle and persuasive than AB.<br />As an Australian I wonder what this film  says about American Culture (we Aussies love to hate (hate to love?)  America): is it a sign of a maturing culture or a decaying one? Is America  coming to terms with its demons or is the 'serpent eating its tail'. Is it  healthy to expose your shadow to the 'neon glare' of Hollywood or have you  just run out of ideas?   I certainly was not bored by this movie but I  suspect that its significance will be judged in time not because it was  technically brilliant (although it was technically good), not because it  had great acting (although many of the performances were excellent) or not  because the images will stay with us (although many were well crafted), but  more because of what is says about the time.<br />For all its blackness  American Beauty still seems a sanitised version of Solondz's 'Happiness' or  Kaye's 'American History X'. But I guess the 'jury's still out'. I'll have  to let it percolate, I'll have to listen to the perspective of others, I'll  have to let time pass on this one. <br />If you can't immediately love a  movie, maybe being undecided is a worthy second for a filmmaker.

What you must love about BIGGIe is that he not only makes stories that you can visualize but ones that you can't help but quote and bop to.  &quot;BIG POPPA&quot; and &quot;JUICY&quot; are great club bangers of yesteryear.  This album is constantly in my cd player, and I've had it for four years now !  I'm still not sick of it, I doubt i ever will be. <br /> His lyrical skills were just amazing to listen to and still are.  The man can take any genre and mould lyrics and chants that you can't get out of your head, even if you don't like him.  A true legend.  I can rhyme nearly ever song on this album, the only one that i don't like, if any, is RESPECT.  That reggae part is annoying and doesn't relate to any other part of the album. This album is a must have if your a fan of hip hop, hip hop, not any stupid bs beliefs in what coast a rapper is from.  That belief is totally ignorant and rude.  If the bloodshed of the two greatest rappers ever isn't enough for you to realize that, then the hell with you, you're not a fan of hiphop, you're a fan of ignorance. <br /> Nobody but Tupac can match his vivid descriptions of growing up in such harsh, violent, and depressing enviornments.  &quot;Remember back in the days, when niggas had ways, gazelle shades, and comb braides. Picture deli's, ladies with the high top jellies, shootin skelli..., turn your pages to 1993, niggas is getting smoked G, believe me !&quot; A great intro into a sad song.  <br /> Here's another classic from the album; a quote from everyday struggle: &quot;You don't know about the stress filled days, babyon the way, mad bills to pay, that's why you drink tanqueray and reminisce, and wish, that you weren't livin so devilish.&quot; My absolute fave on this album is &quot;GIMME THE LOOT&quot; which is one of the most rage filled hardcore, thug anthems you'll ever hear.  &quot;MOM duke's ain't givin me S*it, so for the bread and butter i leave N**Gas in the gutter!&quot; <br /> In conclusion, if you really want to become an expert on hip hop, and know one the greatest mc's that ever rocked the mic, check this one out, his other albums don't come as close as this one.  This is truly a carefully crafted piece of work, he was the shining legend of Bad boy records, which as you can see, only makes money off him. Nevertheless, RIP B.I.G, he was truly one of two greats in hip hop. Crap pumped out in mass volumes don't have nearly as close the quality as one of his two albums, or the slew that TUPAC SHAKUr released. We will never forget you Chris, thanks for the memories.<br />A true Fan, <br /> Rajah DOLEMITE

Picture deli's, ladies with the high top  jellies, shootin skelli, mother f**kers we're all friendly, turn your pages  to 1993, niggas is getting smoked G, believe me !&quot; A great intro into  a sad song.  <br />         Here's another classic from the album; a quote  from everyday struggle: &quot;You don't know about the stress filled days,  baby on the way, mad bills to pay, that's why you drink tanqueray and  reminisce, and wish, that you weren't livin so devilish.&quot; My absolute  fave on this album is &quot;GIMME THE LOOT&quot; which is one of the most  rage filled hardcore, thug anthems you'll ever hear.  &quot;MOM duke's  ain't givin me S*it, so for the bread and butter i leave N**Gas in the  gutter!&quot; <br />         In conclusion, if you really want to become an  expert on hip hop, and know one the greatest mc's that ever rocked the mic,  check this one out, his other albums don't come as close as this one.  This  is truly a carefully crafted piece of work, he was the shining legend of  Bad boy records, which as you can see, only makes money off him.   Nevertheless, RIP B.I.G, he was truly one of two greats in hip hop.  Crap  pumped out in mass volumes don't have nearly as close the quality as one of  his two albums, or the slew that TUPAC SHAKUr released. We will never  forget you Chris, thanks for the memories.<br />A true Fan, <br />            Rajah DOLEMITE
0060920386|5.0|I am a management consultant who works with companies that are interested in improving stock price, and I know many of the more humble people portrayed in BARBARIANS AT THE GATE.<br />I would like to put this book into perspective for you. 20 years ago our firm did a survey of CEOs and found  that 99 percent felt that trying to improve stock price was unethical and  immoral, and involved doing manipulative things.<br />After the takeover wars  of the 1980s, most CEOs believed that improving stock price was an  important task and could be done in an ethical way. There is nothing more  disruptive to a company than to go through a hostile takeover, whether the  bid succeeds or not. Raw greed and lust for power hold sway at such times,  and many people will pay the price for having attracted the sharks into  their swimming pool.<br />Prior to the RJR Nabisco purchase by KKR, many  large companies felt safe because of their size. They were suffering from  &quot;stalled&quot; thinking, because it was widely believed that a deal of  this sort could not be financed with debt at the time the takeover  occurred. That was wrong:  For a price, the money is always there.<br />For  those who have not been in these bruising ego battles, what you will not  realize is that these contests are a lot like those you will remember from  grade school on the playground when the teachers were not around. Bullying,  threats, and naked power carry the day in a lot of situations.  But because  this is about ego, a lot of mistakes are made. RJR Nabisco continued to  strain under mountains of debt for years, even after lots of refinancings  because of the LBO.<br />KKR's track record looks a lot different now than it  did before buying RJR Nabisco. A lot of the fever behind the LBO's is gone,  for now. Bring back a bear market for a few years, and this whole phenomena  will recur. Some smart lawyer will find a way around the defenses that so  many rely on for now. The only ultimate defense against the circling sharks  is to have a high-priced multiple stock. That is the only timeless lesson  for companies.<br />If you are wondering how accurate this book is, it is  more right than wrong. The authors did, however, miss some of the most  intriguing ironies of the situation. Perhaps someday, someone with inside  knowledge will write the sequel or unveil the whole, delicious irony. That  should be a great story that will outsell GONE WITH THE WIND.<br />With the  benefit of this context, I do recommend you read the book.  You'll find it  stranger than fiction in many ways, and very exciting to watch.  The  authors have captured the emotion of the moment very well.  It's a whale of  a story.against the circling sharks  is to have a high-priced multiple stock.

B00002DEIX|5.0|Beg, borrow, steal pennies from small children if you need to to buy this one: two tracks into my first listen and I knew it was a keeper. A few highlights: the (all too brief) counterpoint between Redman and pianist  Aaron Goldberg in Belonging will remind you of the now distant  compositional love affair between Brubeck and Paul Desmond; beautiful  progressions in Neverend recall Redman's collaboration with McCoy Tyner in  Prelude and Sonata; how to describe the ballad, Balance, except that I'm  wearing out the repeat button on my remote and the laser light in my CD  replaying it.
B0000074B6|5.0|This album is a major link between the worlds of historic blues and mainstream rock'n'roll. It's blues with a rock tinge, rather like early Rolling Stones could be considered rock with a blues influence. Taj Mahal  mines the historic blues-song archives and the arrangements are tight,  driving, and above all, danceable as hell (keep in mind that the blues  aren't just some depressed guy sitting around crying into his guitar --  they are party music, and that function is as important as personal  expression). Taj has some incredibly skilled musicians in his bands, and  they support him with lively, almost fiery playing that complements the  effort that Taj puts forth very well.<br />This album introduced me to the  blues in 1968 and I have researched, played, sung, and loved the blues ever  since. I still have the vinyl disk, worn and crackly. To have the music as  clear and fresh as it is here is a godsend.<br />It's a lot of fun to get into  the background of such music, hear its roots, and later hear (and  understand) its offspring. But the best thing about this album -- it's just  plain fun to hear.

B000002UWE|5.0|A lot of the music from the 1980's has lost it's power and magic, simply because we live in the year 2000 now. But the music from the band Talk Talk has survived. To me songs like &quot;Such a shame&quot;, &quot;It's my  life&quot; and &quot;Living in another world&quot; seem stronger than ever.  Only a very few pop- and rockbands (Pink Floyd, Yello and Talk Talk) are  able to create this kind of music: beautiful, imaginative and dreamy music,  music that seems timeless, just like classical music from Mozart and  Vivaldi. Just listen to those synth-violins, while Mark Hollis sings the  chorus in &quot;Such a shame&quot;, and listen to the slow, dreamy  synthesizer-solo in that song! I don't know about you, but it surely makes  ME dream away! And so does the organ in &quot;Living in another  world&quot;! Some persons claim, that Hollis can't sing, but I think, he is  perfect. His singing is emotional; sometimes he growls and mutters like a  bear or he he cries out in anger and dispair. At other times his voice is  soft and kind. His singing is in fact the very heart of Talk Talk's music.  The music of Talk Talk is very original. I prefer the songs from their  first 3 albums, because they are so melodic, so beatiful. I miss a few  songs, that aren't on this compilation (for example &quot;Have you heard  the news?&quot; and &quot;Time it's time&quot;). But I think, it's a good  compilation anyhow.  Talk Talk don't exist as a band anylonger. Mark Hollis  has gone solo and nowadays he makes very quiet, jazzy music, which seems  incredibly boring to me. Apparently he no longer wants to make that kind of  music that made Talk Talk so unique. Well, SUCH A SHAME!
B00000AFGM|5.0|This CD is nothing short of incredible, and it is totally different from Antichrist Superstar. I'm not going to say that this is better than Antichrist Superstar, but I'm not saying that Antichrist Superstar is  better than it either. It's kind of hard to compare the two at all since  Mr. Manson has changed up his music style so much in this one. All the  songs on this CD have more melody and are less hate-filled. As a matter of  fact the only song that even comes close to resembling a song from ACSS is  &quot;Rock is Dead&quot; which seems to combine both of the styles of ACSS  and MA. Another thing... for you religious types out there who dislike  Manson for his Christian bashing, you should get this CD. It is very  harmonious and shows a completely different side of Marilyn.
B000023X9W|5.0|Neil Young 's new album is a masterpiece.Albums like &quot;harvest&quot; or &quot;freedom&quot; are just in the same spirrit.On &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; you hear Neil's friends like on steel guitar Ben Keith or on  drums Jim Keltner.The songs on this album are simple and great.Just real  instruments and no computers,that's why some fans love Young's music.There  are some moments on this album which shows that Neil Young longs to the  past .Listen to the song &quot;Buffalo Springfield again&quot; and you will  hear what i mean.When you listen to this album you 'll find beautiful music  with great lyrics.

THERE ARE A LOT OF SONGZ ON HERE BUT THA PROBLEM IS THEY ALL SOUND THA SAME AND THEY AINT EVEN PUNK THEY SOUND LIKE ALTRENATIVE OR SOMETHING. THIS CD'S GOT  MORE SONGS THAN ANY OTHER CD I OWN BUT I STILL CANT FIND 1 SONG I LIKE ON  IT. IF U PPL THINK U CAN HANDLE TRU HARDCORE PUNK THEN CHECK OUT OLD KORN  AND LIMP BIZKIT P.O.D. OR STAIND.
0792151720|3.0|If you're a Titanic-ophile like me, you loved the historical detail and accuracy of this movie in the theaters.  Unfortunately, most of those scenes (most notably the radio room and bridge scenes) were cut out of the  home version and we're left with the dreadful dialog and poor acting of the  two main characters who represent two of the most self-absorbed and immoral  people movie audiences have ever had the misfortune of being subjected to,  not to mention the foul-mouthed crew in the contemporary scenes.  The  movie's imagery loses a great deal of it's impact on the small screen,  though it's still a marvelous trip to the Titanic itself.  It's just a  shame we're forced to go aboard with Jack and Rose.

6304383827|5.0|Emma is a great movie.  Gwyneth Paltrow delivers an outstanding performance as the perpetually misguided but delightful Emma, and Jeremy Northam is excellent as the wise and kind Mr. Knightley.  The dialogue is  funny, and the scenery and costumes are beautiful.  It was surprisingly  faithful to the book, and it shouldn't disappoint avid fans of the book.   It's absolutely wonderful.  I rented over the weekend and watched it four  times!
B00000K31Q|5.0|&quot;Why should I live up to other people's expectations instead of my own?&quot; Those are the words of Kat Stratford, the center of a good movie that means far more than comedy. This movie is a gem, and the DVD well  accomodates it. This movie has the perfect blend of comedy and emotion  under the rule of Shakespeare, minus the fancy language. This movie  simplifies Shakespeare majorly for makeup-wearing, boy-crazy, hair-dyeing,  N'Sync-loving 90's teens, but doesn't stray far, for people who obsess over  every Monday detail. And it's all combined with plenty of laughs, a  star-studded cast, excellent moral values, dramatic elements for the  drama-loving, romance for the romance-loving, and an excellent soundtrack.  And the bloopers at the end top the cherry on the sundae. So this movie is  for every movie goer, no matter what age. And the DVD is of excellent  shape, too. The picture quality is in top shape, the trailer is included,  and I don't have Dolby Digital surround sound, so I wouldn't know what you  mean by bad sound. But I can promise you if you're a simpleton, this DVD  will work wonders for you. But it's funny, this DVD was processed like any  other Buena Vista DVD that has OK sound, so I don't see why people say the  sound on this DVD is bad, but it's great if you just have a TV and DVD  player. <br />So in other words, you've GOT to get this DVD. No matter WHAT  your movie taste is, and whatever your age is, you WILL love this movie. If  you're a teen, you'll love it. If you're an adult, you'll love it. If you  love comedy, you'll love it. If you love great music and great stars,  you'll love it.  And if you're crazy about drama or romance, you'll love it  too. And this DVD couldn't be more simple, so this DVD is perfectly suited  for the handyman. So get this DVD! The money's well spent! Trust me on  that!

B000002N25|5.0|frankly speaking i'm a fan of his music style, great guitaring, relaxed vocal. now he add versatility with those. the songs in this album have a bit folkish flavour. you'll get country, you'll get rock and some great  ballads. use of  instruments are too good and that makes it a truely  satisfying album to listen.
0783222734|2.0|This is a typical Spielberg garbage: empty characters, a cast of bad actors, the full emphasis on special effects and not the history. Blergh!
0451169514|5.0|What is IT? IT is your worst nightmare.  IT is all your fears, and horrors come to life.  I read this book in about 6 hours, I never put it down.  Derry, the town were IT took place, was the town of 7 children, the only people who could kill IT.  IT's most common face(it could be anyone as long as you had an imagination) was Pennywise/Bob Gray.  Stephen King definetely  made this a very long book, but it says everything it should, no more, no  less.  IT has it's catchy lines such as:<br />- We all float down here!  -  You'll DIE if you try!  -Aww....what's wrong you wanna it don't ya? DONT YA  WANNA IT!  - Oh yes georgie...they float, theyyyy float, and when you're  down here with me..YOU'LL FLOAT TOO!  These are all quotes from Pennywise  the Clown(the best evil villain Yet!).  And they can be VERY FUNNY in the  movie.  The actor's voice was perfect for this role.<br /> IT can make you  frightened for those who have imaginations.  This book has some gruesome  parts and some sexual parts(Patrick Hockstetter and Henry Bowers  chapter...eeww).  I think the creators of the film IT, definetely portrayed  the book very well.  However, they left out some good parts and the ending  was one of the cheesiest things I ever saw(Don't Worry this doesn't ruin  the WHOLE book and I am not giving away anything here), they did not  portray Stephen  King's ending at ALL. I recommend this book for people  with IMAGINATIONS, or else it won't be half as good.  I have to say this is  Stephen King's finest.<br />Danny Ferraro, Age 13
0783227272|2.0|This director is so arrogant, that it makes me furious. THis is clear in this movie, that just doesnt take off anytime. The depth of character is much less than &quot;SCHINDLERS LIST&quot;, and it is obvious for anyone  who watched this movie that Spielberg was aiming for a lot of OSCARS! H,  h, h! He didnt get it, because the plot is weak.
B000002GF8|5.0|OK, so maybe this was the biggest commercial success The Police had; purist or not, there's no denying the sheer musical and intellectual brilliance of this album.  Sting does get kind of pedantic and preachy  here, but this former teacher  displayed these tendencies on every Police  album.  (A friend and I, both fourteen at the time, agreed that the album  was so &quot;mentally exhausting&quot; that it wasn't the type of work you  could listen to over and over again without a break.  But how many other  artists in 1983 challenged any of their fans, mentally or otherwise?)  &quot;Mother&quot; is a bit odd, but hey, maybe it was Andy Summers' way of  rebelling against Sting's dominance of the band at that time.   &quot;Synchronicity II&quot; and &quot;O My God&quot;, to name just two,  still retain their luster 17 years later.  All in all, this was one hell of  a way to go out!
079073804X|5.0|This is the only movie I ever saw that really scared me. But, WOW, did it ever scare me! It makes you feel you are actually faced with real evil. The Special Edition DVD showed something that hadn't been included in the  movie, the &quot;spider walk.&quot; This scene gave me goose bumps. After  all these years, I never would have thought anything could chill me to such  an extent. If you like to experience fear in the safety of your chair, this  is for you!
0671042858|3.0|In the past week I have read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and Hearts in Atlantis. They are very different. Both are very worthwhile. This book sucks you in and won't let you go. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is very fast paced and I love the message. The last few paragraphs are outstanding.  A recommendable book-even if you aren't a Sox fan.
B000007NYS|3.0|the true test of ms. williams genius is the fact that so many artists have found her songs strong enough to cover.  But the most compelling aspect of her songs is the fact that when she sings them herself, the resulting  product is absolutely sublime.  I love mary chapin-carpenter, but  'passionate kisses', sung in ms.williams voice, is truly a work of art.   'side of the road', with its beautiful violin chorus, is almost too much to  describe in words.  Let me try.  You been in love recently, real love?   this tells it all.  Worthy of literary criticism, worthy of a slot on the  soundtrack of your life.  if your lucky enough to get the live version, a  little longer and slower, you can consider yourself a lucky person.   reminds me of dylan, really.  take your divas and your wanna be's, this  womans voice speaks in the language of the soul.
0312243022|4.0|This is a work of creative genius in which leitmotifs of Virginia Woolf's works weave their melody in a new composition that helps the reader understand what Woolf was driving at--how we are haunted by our past and its turning points and moments of great promise, the books we read, how  others may see us represented in fiction and how we respond to that, to  yearning for what we can't have or what we threw away in a moment.  Sexuality has been inverted from the heterosexual world Woolf lived in  where to be gay was exciting and romantic, to the world of 90's New York  where homosexuality itself has slipped into conventionality and bourgeois  manners, but the problems are still the same: &quot;There's so little love  in the world,&quot; one of the gay characters realizes ultimately.<br />What  keeps the work from being great is the fact that it's perhaps a little too  clever for its own good, and its hard to get around the contrivance to  actually care about these self-absorbed characters.  Only the character of  Virginia Woolf as Cunningham depicts her seems fully human and not just  artifice.<br />Still the book is very thought-provoking and makes a wonderful  focus for a book group discussion.  Although it is relatively short and  easy to read, it is packed with provocative ideas and a few surprises.
B00003CX59|5.0|This movie was visually immaculate.  The scenery and actors blended perfectly that you could ignore Ricci's less than average performance.  The story was well depicted and Depp did a good job breathing life into a  rather two dimensional character (from the book).  Would have loved to have  seen more of Walken/The horseman, but got just enough to want more.
6304981635|4.0|This entertaining mix of James Bond espionage and great kung-fu staged by the martial arts master Bruce Lee. While the ridiculous dubbing, plot and Bruce Lee's acting are campy, the fight sequences are the real star in this  movie. Great action sequences and martial arts. Spectacular Martial Arts  and a star vehicle for Bruce Lee. A landmark inside its genre; Kung-Fu  movies and a great action movie, but not much else. Extras: watch for then  stuntman Jackie Chan in the lab fight, he's the one that got his neck  broken by Bruce Lee. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!
0385484518|5.0|Many people go through life simply surviving.  Morrie teaches that life is to be treasured and thrived.  By learning how to die, he shows everyone else how to live a deep, fulfilling, rich, meaningful life.  I'm a student in High School and I've already learned the conditioning of society to put  people on their monotonous treadmill of life.  With help from Morrie, I'm  continually learning how to love every second of life.  You can't put a  price on living a fulfilling life.  It's priceless yet it's given to you  through Morrie's experience with learning how to die.  Take his experience  and learn how to live.  It's the best book you'll ever read.
B00000JXV7|3.0|This film is badly written and badly directed. Sandra Bullock overacts and just seems to be having fun instead of acting. Ben Affleck seems to be aware that he made a career mistake and it shows. Absolutely no chemistry  between the two leads, and an unsatisfying ending, but taking into  consideration the lack of chemistry maybe it is appropriate. OK movie but  lots of flaws. Nice 'weather' imagery and some funny moments. Ultimately  entertaining if not a bit too long. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a  5!
B00003CX5A|4.0|Very, very good film indeed. The story opens up immediately and it has 'got' you till the end. The scenes are all very dark and misty and that adds to a good atmosphere throughout the whole film. It certainly has got  some scary moments in it, but I think this film wasn't made to scare you.  It's more like a 'thriller-James Bond'  In some of the scenes, Johnny Depp  is acting so dumb, you'll have to laugh about it and you'll lose some of  the tense. BUT, despite that, a very good film you must see.
B00000JWVO|5.0|I brought this video in September of last year and have already worn out the 'Rum Tum Tugger' and 'Mr Mistofollees'! Every actor fitted his and her parts perfectly. It is evident that certain actors outshone the rest, for  me the one actor that stood out was John Partridge. With his energetic and  agile dancing he pulled the veiwer into his character, he has one of the  best male voices I've ever heard, and I've heard quite a few talented  people! But as he seems to be commented on frequently, i will also comment  on those other actors that i believe aren't recognised enough. Geoff  Garrant, although dubbed, gave a wonderful performance as Skimbleshanks. I  also though Phyliddia Crowley Smith as Victoria was wonderful, I hold my  breath every time she does that amazing leg thing! This was a star cast. I  was appalled at the dubbing, most notably in 'Gumbie Cat' but I still love  this video. If you want to hear more of John Partridge sing then go buy  'The New Starlight Express' i promise you won't be disappointed!
B000031WD8|2.0|Absolutely NOT what I expected. This film is really cheap. I must admit there are some really funny parts, but the story is only about sex.  I know that this is the theme, but wouldn't it be nice just to have a little story  surrounding it?  If you are drunk I think you will find this film  absolutely fantastic. But I wasn't, and still I had to puke. The end is SO  discustingly moralistic, telling that life is not just about sex.....  Really made me sick.
0812932293|4.0|This book provides insight into why some people rise above the crowd to succeed. Richard Branson's voracious appetite for life is on display here. Great financial success here was not the result of a great intellect, but great charisma, curiosity, and drive. Branson's creed is keep it simple,  and it's not what you know, but who you know: contacts, networking. Branson  makes much of how busy he is, but I don't believe he's that much busier  than any professional person, where 12-16 hour workdays are the norm. His  rewards (and risks) have just been much greater than the average guys.  Despite the apparent youthful greed that got him arrested for tax evasion,  and that almost got him to sue John Lennon for breach of contract after the  death of Lennon's unborn child, Branson comes across as deserving as anyone  of his financial success. He's aware &quot;success&quot; is an illusion,  and is willing to lose it all, his family, his wealth, in an agnostic  balloon crash. The balooning extracts in the book were the most exciting,  though the financial juggling to keep the various Virgins afloat as  overdrafts were about to be withdrawn was entertaining reading. Hooray for  Branson's wealth and interesting life, but Virgin Cola like Coca Cola  doesn't do much for the vast mass of humanity out here in the third world.  Who know's why some do so well, and  those in the third world, even if they  are ambitous, suffer.  Not a boring read. Branson is refreshingly  forthright.
6305428220|3.0|I think the Faculty is an average film. It's not very scary but it certainly has a  strange atmosphere around it. The teachers are having strange looks on their faces and later on you don't know who is 'good' and  who is 'bad'. The end of the film is a bit exaggerated, with this huge  monster which I will not describe... If you want to see an entertaining  movie, you can watch this film. I must say, the special effects are quite  good and the film is not bad, but it could have been better with a more  complete storyline.

B00003CWL6|5.0|It seems to me that all of the negative reviews of this film have taken the movie too literaly. There  are so many aspects of the film that a viewer can  love: the story, cinematography, performances, music, etc.  &quot;American Beauty&quot; reserves its meaning for each person that views  it. See this movie and find its meaning for yourself, but don't deny the  beauty of wonderful elements that compose this masterpiece. If you can't  find one thing that is phenominal in this film then you are missing film at  its best
B00000B9N3|5.0|Any disc that features Uri Caine, Erik Friedlander, Mark Feldman, and Drew Gress is guaranteed to be adventurous and exciting, but this release sees the whole even greater than its parts.  Wagner is given a whole new spin by  the ensemble. This may be the catalyst for other jazzers to take more  chances with the western classical canon.  We can only hope that future  attempts at such crossovers yield such gorgeous results.  HIGHLY  recommended to Classical and jazz fans alike.
0784011206|5.0|Everything about this is brilliant. From Goldsmith's rousing score to Stallone's perfect performance. Yes, you heard me. Stallone does act in this movie. I feel so sorry for Rambo. People are real nasty to him. Especially the deputy with the moustache. He was a real jerk. The scene in which Rambo finally explodes in the jail cell is way cool. The music that goes with this scene is SO intense.<br /><br />The Pacific Northwest scenery is also very beautiful and atmospheric. The sound design seems to be crafted so that dialogue sound natural like it would in a mountain forest or in dead cold environments where the air cannot carry sound so well.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sounds brilliant. I highly recommend that you buy this and the soundtrack. This is a proper movie by the way. I know that the character of Rambo became a 'little' exaggerated and silly in the sequels but do not let that alter your opinion of this movie.
0380973464|4.0|If you are even vaguely interested in Cryptography, it's history and present day use, this book will suit you well. I found the book to be an extremely fast and easy read, despite its \\"War and Peace\\" appearance. Though not quite a classic, it is the best travel or beach book I have yet  to read. Its plot will keep you interested and the characters are both  believable and genuine. Again, this book will keep your mind involved and  remind you why you read fiction in the first place; it's all about telling  a good story. And this is one of them!
6305090564|2.0|I have this DVD and the last time I watched it was well over a year ago. Every set looks the same as the last and it's just so dull. It should have been gorier and milked it's hardly original concept for all it's worth. The  dialogue simply stinks too. Jerry Goldsmith's music is below par also which  is strange for him. All you get on this non-anamorphic DVD is a trailer.  Watch out for Sommers' next movie &quot;The Mummy&quot; it's also garbage.  Some nice effects though.

0964385619|1.0|I bought this book based on the glowing reviews it received here at Amazon[.com] and have found it disappointing. As one reader mentioned, the book reads like an advertisement for the author's other products. His tone is that of a used car salesman who keeps repeating the same points over and over in the hope the reader might be persuaded by bombardment rather than fact. The examples he gives are all personal anecdotes which are quaint but not convincing. There are no secrets , and the common sense tips given are in the main cliché. <br />Don't be fooled by the other reviews, methinks they are not all what they appear. Look how many of them, like the book, advertise other products by Kiyosaki.<br />The book has given me the motivation to study further into stocks and trading, but this book will not serve as a reference in my future financial plans. Don't be fooled, don't buy the book.<br />Also check out the voting on reviews of this book - look at how many unhelpful votes the lower star reviews get. I haven't seen that happen on any other book. Is there some manipulation going on here?
B000002LPD|5.0|My favorite Van Halen album.That's because the greatets guitarist of all time stretched his muscles in it.Heck,he's the greatest musician of all time.No one even compares to Eddie Van Halen when it comes to guitars and   music.Not Hendrix,not Clapton,not Page,not even Beethoven.He outdoes them  all,very easily.Call me obsessed or whatever you want to call me ,but it's  the truth.<br />Pros:<br />*Sammy Hagar.<br />*Alex Van Halen.<br />*Michael  Anthony.<br />*Eddie Van Halen.<br />*Simply,it's Van Halen.<br />*Features one of  the band's greatest songs,Poundcake.This song is a musical wonder.It  reached perfection.Everything in it is  perfect:guitars,bass,drums,vocals,solos,and everything imaginable.Eddie Van  Halen's solo here(with Michael's bass and Alex' drums on the background) is  the single most beautiful thing I have ever heard in  my entire life.I lose  the feeling of the outer world  when I hear that song,especially when I get  to that part.<br />*Features some other great songs,like &quot;Man on a  Mission&quot;,&quot;Judgement Day&quot;(just listen to Eddie's solo and you  will be blown away! Michael ROCKED in it too!),&quot;Spanked&quot;(with  some red-hot solos as well),and other gems.<br />Cons:<br />Nothing.<br />Bottom  line:buy this masterpiece and listen to some real music.If you love  pure,undefiled,unadulterated art,you have &quot;Poundcake&quot;.If you're  kinda' sentimental,there's &quot;316&quot;.If you love fast rock songs with  smokin' solos,there's &quot;Judgement Day&quot;.Want a light,fun,simple yet  artful song?Try &quot;Runaround&quot;.How about a song chockfull of bass  and guitars that woukld leave you astonished?Give &quot;Spanked&quot; a  try.You want a musical epic with everyhting you like?Try &quot;In 'N'  Out&quot;.And trust me,those are just a few.Just wait till you get to  &quot;Man on Mission&quot;,&quot;Pleasure Dome&quot;(drum mania!),and the  rest of tracks.
0553288105|4.0|One thing I always have to remind myself when it comes to reading Asimov is that even though I've seen some of his ideas and concepts before in other author's works, that Asimov was in many ways a pioneer in the field at the time he wrote.   The Gods Themselves is no exception to that rule.   Yes, there are elements in this novel that others have done but none of  them really as well as Asimov.  There are others here who have explained  the premise of this novel far better than I could and without giving away  little nuggets of information that could, quite possibly ruin the  narrative.  Needless to say, Asimov does well with the science and  consequences of the situation. What is lacking in the novel are characters  of much depth and interest.  Many of the players are one-dimensional and  rarely break out of that mold.  Asimov has shown he can write memorable and  entertaining characters who have some depth (Bailey and R. Daneel Olivaw  are two that spring to mind). However, here Asimov seems to fall too much  in love with the science of what he is trying to explain rather than having  interesting characters in the mix.  Which takes away from an otherwise  flawless novel.  <br />Certainly this book is recommended.  It's just not my  favorite Asimov.

6304779607|3.0|I remember when Cobra first came out there were posters for it all over the place. I was mesmerized by the simplicity and suggestive nature of them. Stallone, against a red background, chewing a match, with his custom-made pistol tucked under his belt. I'd never seen anyone chew a matchstick before, I'd never seen a laser-targeting machine gun, and the idea of a cop associating himself with an animal was intriguing.<br /><br />In 1988 I rented the VHS tape from the local store. It was one of those old, massive, clamshell cases with the old Warner logo on the side. That night, at the age of 7, I was left alone for a few hours and the movie was merely to keep me amused and out of trouble. It didn't so much amuse me as it did terrify me. For any action-junkie kid born in the 80s the words 'Night Slasher' will be forever carved into your consciousness. This guy, to me, at that age, was the ultimate villain, and pushed the movie out of the action genre and into horror. I developed a fear of strange men driving around in unassuming vans, which I still have. Brian Thompson (who was only 26 at the time) is utterly bone-chilling in the role. You might recognize in a less terrifying role as the punk who challenges the naked T-800 with 'Nice night for a walk, eh?' in the first Terminator.<br /><br />Marion Cobretti (Stallone in another bigger-than-life role) is part of the 'zombie squad', a group of LAPD cops who are the absolute bottom line and will do the jobs that no one else wants. The movie opens with some random psycho holding hostages in a supermarket. 'Call the Cobra' the normal, useless cops say. Cobra arrives in his muscle car and calmly enters the store, sipping some free beer and taunting the psycho before obliterating him, much to the distaste of the wimpy, bleeding-heart liberal media circus who have invaded the scene.<br /><br />Cobra believes that the supermarket psycho is part of a bigger gang, an axe-clanking cult in which members from every facet of society gather in a sewer to clank axes over their heads. Their leader is the Night Slasher, a man who's head is 95% cheekbone and 5% staring, staring, staring eyes. He believes in creating a New World, not the Aldous Huxley kind but the kind which can be achieved, somehow, by murdering random blondes. His latest target is Ingrid (Brigitte Nielsen in a so very not Oscar-winning role), a model who towers over Cobra by a full 4 inches, but she needs his protection and he needs to keep her alive as a witness. Not taking too kindly to having people being able to identify him the Night Slasher rounds up all of his fellow psychos and unleashes World War 3 on California, thus creating thousands more witness in the process, but logic is not this film's strong point.<br /><br />After finding success with Rocky and Rambo, Stallone was clearing trying to create his own spin on Dirty Harry here (the Dirty Harry villain Scorpio even features here as an unhelpful Detective constantly berating Cobra). There is a strong right-wing theme of fighting fire with fire, and that with psychos as utterly demented as the Night Slasher you need someone just as unsympathetic and daring on the right side of the law to combat him. It's so far-fetched, and filled with dozens of logical and physical impossibilities that it makes Commando look like a freakin' documentary. But while Commando was cheerful, upbeat and self-aware, Cobra is deadly, deadly serious and believes itself to be making a serious point of how close society can come to complete anarchy if the Police were not there to keep the psychos off the streets.<br /><br />This would be a fine message for an action picture, but there is a air of sleaziness to the production that spoils it. Many scenes are set in oppressive environments such as parking lots or concrete underpasses which give it a cold, alienating feel more like early James Glickenhaus or Joseph Zito films.<br />Cobra is also produced by the notorious Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus,and directed, mostly, like a pop music video by George Pan Cosmatos. There are lots of quick cuts and fish-eye lens shots. Cosmatos overdoes it with these gimmicks in a few scenes. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. If there was a little more elegance to the production then perhaps the critics might not have been so merciless and it might have aged a bit better too. I realize that this not a Kenneth Branagh film, but it's still too mainstream to be outright exploitation and too sleazy to deliver the conservative message it so desperately wants us to believe in.<br /><br />These days few movies are as straight-up and to-the-point as Cobra. The one-man army theme was the 80s zeitgeist. Before John McClane came along and made the vulnerable hero fashionable audiences preferred the bulletproof, genuine, straight-up tough guy. Cobra has endured a lasting cult following thanks to its undeniable 80s mentality. A film like this would be very, very quickly forgotten in modern times. If you want 87 minutes of entertainment it works, if you want to look beneath the surface at a possibly deeper message, Cobra almost, just barely has one.<br /><br />It's insane to think that this film is basically Stallone's Beverly Hills Cop. When he was attached to star as Axel Foley he wanted to make the film more action-orientated. Paramount didn't want to spend so much money on the project so he left, and took his ideas with him. Those ideas were turned into Cobra, despite an onscreen credit for 'Based on the novel Fair Game, by Paula Gosling', a novel it bears little resemblance to, which was later turned into its own movie in 1995 (starring Steven Berkoff as the villain, who was also the villain in Beverly Hills Cop and Rambo 2) which is absolutely nothing like Beverly Hills Cop or Cobra. And on top of all that a poster for Cobra can be seen in Beverly Hills Cop 2, which stars Brigitte Nielsen.<br /><br />Try getting your head around that.<br /><br />The Blu Ray presents the film in a reasonable 1.78:1 1080p transfer. There aren't many high-key shots in the film to take full advantage of HD, but it's certainly a considerably upgrade from the shoddy DVD. The sound is in DTS HD-MA and there are a tiny amount of extras. A shame, as I'd really like to hear what Stallone thinks of this film these days.e Pan Cosmatos.

B00004SVID|1.0|I'm not giving The Wall one star, but I'm giving this release one star.  The Wall is one the best albums in music history, but we've heard many The Walls: The original one (1979), a movie, different versions by different members from Pink floyd for more than 30 years.  It's enough people.  We cannot look at Pink Floyd through The Wall only and after 30 years.  Will  they try to come up with something new close to level of The Wall?  Is it  not more productive if they give a real effort for a new album instead of  reissuing The Wall?  Will you be giving them 5 stars for any version of The  wall? Do you suggest (by giving 5 stars) that Pink floyd should continue to  re- release The Wall for another 30 years?  Get real, we do not need this  one.  Do not get me wrong.  Pink floyd is my favorite band.  A band which  came up with many great albums is certainly capable of producing some new  nice music.  I'm sorry, this release is to deceive their fans.

B000003TBP|5.0|&quot;Mellow Gold&quot; is the favorite of my Beck collection, but &quot;Odelay&quot; is a good one, as well. None of the songs are alike, and feature the biggest mix of musical genres ever clogged into one song,  thanks to a tape sampler which includes samples of his favorite artists.  Beck is a good songwriter, but he is better represented in &quot;Mellow  Gold&quot; and &quot;One Foot In The Grave&quot;. None of the songs keep  the same sound for long, constantly changing chords, samples, and  instruments. I'm not a fan of rap music at all, but &quot;Derelict&quot;  and &quot;Novacane&quot; are still pretty good. &quot;Jack-Ass&quot;,  &quot;Devil's Haircut&quot;, &quot;The New Pollution&quot;,  &quot;Readymade&quot;,&quot;Sissyneck&quot;, and &quot;Ramshackle&quot; are  my favorite songs. The only song which is completely unnecessary is  &quot;High 5&quot;, which is pure rap rubbish. (No Offense). All else is  good. Who else could come up with lyrics that talk about devils &amp;  discount orgies, androids hooked on novcacane, pagans &amp; horse's asses,  drifters writing their wills on three-dollar bills, brothers pissing in  cups then getting killed, and laid-back behind-the-wheel loneliness?
B00000DLV1|5.0|The success of a live album depends on how much the artist gets involved in its own songs and how expressive he or she is. In the hands of a good artist a live album can be more rewarding than the studio version, although  they come few and far between. Portishead live in NYC  is one of those life  affirming exceptions.  By the time you listen to &quot;over&quot; the  quality of her voice is no longer the matter, you can actually FEEL that  she is not faking it. Portishead live become the  sound of pain, pleasure  in pain, longing, desire, loss, and love. Like vintage Nina Simone, Beth's  emotions are on top of the songs and not the opposite because she  intuitively knows that artists like lovers,  can't have a greater triumph  than making the listener feel what they feel. Live in this case means alive  and real. If the amazing singing wasn't enough, the strings are wonderfully  used adding tension in a no-nonsense fashion to the already well crafted  songs. The scratching, the guitar scrapping, and the programming make it an  amazingly mind expanding experience too, a lot more powerful than the  studio versions of the songs. Portishead had everything before recording  this album, the good songs, the good musicians and the right ideas, they  just went a step beyond and excelled themselves. Buy this record now.

6302800420|4.0|This film is a requirement for a course I am currently teaching at a local  university.  The course, titled Interpersonal Communication, deals with  relationships with regard to communication and role models.  In the film  &quot;Tootsie&quot; the audience is given an excellent example of gender  attitudes and responsibilities in society.  We can clearly see the  &quot;feminine&quot; side to Michael; we are exposed to the  &quot;masculine&quot; side of Dorothy.  Or is Michael really  &quot;Dorothy&quot;?  Is there something to learn about each of our own  personal/private self?  This film is a wonderful example of those  expectations we have about the opposite sex.  Besides, it's also quite  funny.  So, why is it out of print?
B000023X9W|4.0|This album has been postponed for a long time and now when it finally arrives I was first a bit dissapointed. I thought the songs wasnt that strong. A few days flew by and I listened to the album several times a day and now I must say that the record is very nice. There are very strong and  beautiful songs on the album(such as Razor love and Great divide). Neil  Young has definetely not grown old... he has grown wiser! This album is  said to be the third record in the trilogy with Harvest and Harvest gold. I  actually dont think that this is just a Harvest3 record, I think it has  different types of melodies. This is an excellent recording that any true  musiclover will appreciate. It may take a while to grasp the songs full  potential, but when you reach there it is sure worth it.
B0000004V2|5.0|There are some albums that defy words and defines Generations, Oasis Definetly maybe, The Beatles White album, Primal Screams Screamadelica, Nirvanas Nevermind this album is better than any of them. From the opening  bassline of I Wanna be adored, to the white boy funk of Fools Gold, this  album lifts you up and places you on a peak so high, you can see the whole  of the world. Writen by four guys from Manchester, this is an album that  sounds like none that have gone before and although it is getting on for 12  years old, it still sounds as fresh as the day it was made, fusing reggae  and dub beats, psychodlia, sixties rock, house music, this is an  incrediable album, all the tracks are standouts, but, I wanna be adored,  Waterfall, Song (for my sugar spun sister) and Made of stone distill the  essence of this album, beautiful and love lorn but with a hard jagged edge.  This is the sound of a band playing there finest ever concert, nobody is in  control, no body is trying to out play anybody else, this is the sound of a  band playing in total harmony, the players are'nt the star of this album,  the music is. The band only made one album after this, the shambolic Second  comming, but on this album, they have no peers, taking music to places it  has never been before and can only ever hope to go again.<br />Of the four  members, only singer Ian Brown has managed to capture the swagger, the  style and the mystercisum of this album, the solo work of guitarist John  Squire captures the sound of the Second coming, which is unfortunately a  huge dissapointement.   If you own this album, you'll know what I,m talking  about, if you don't, why not? Everybody should own this album it is the  finest album ever made.
0060926317|5.0|My husband and I both read the book several years ago and liked it.  However since the &quot;death&quot; of our precious child 5 weeks ago, we recently listened to the audio tape of this book and truly connected with  it in a very deep and spiritual way.  In many ways our journey of grief  paralells Marlo's experience in the outback.  We are learning to  communicate in a whole new way with each other and our daughter.  We have  literally been &quot;taken hostage&quot; into a whole new land, one that at  times feels hostile and depriving, but in reality is teaching us a whole  new way of being and living life.  I would highly recommend this book for  anyone in a &quot;grieving&quot; state of being.
B000002HMH|3.0|Pros:<br />*In my humble opinion,I think that the punishing &quot;King Nothing&quot; is the best song here.Extremely powerful.It alone makes this album good,but not great,since the new style isn't as good as,say,the black  album's.<br />*A lot of songs to choose from(14!)<br />Cons:<br />*Not the best  Metallica album.Doesn't get close to the black album,or Reload.<br />Bottom  line:Not the best start if you're a non-Metallica fan,but a terrific choice  for Metallica fans,for the astonishingly powerful &quot;King Nothing&quot;.

0060926317|4.0|This book was loaned to me by a good friend, and once past the first few pages I couldn't put it down. It is easy to read and makes the reader feel like a privileged addition to the tribe of &quot;real people&quot; trekking  across Australia on a &quot;walkabout&quot; with the author. The story is  filled with home truths about prejudice, and ignorance regarding the  aborigines without assigning blame. It reveals a different culture, a  different way to live, one which is frowned on by the  &quot;civilised&quot;, yet they live in complete harmony with nature, and  each other. The book has many highlights, of interest to me were the  profound objective teachings of the aborigines concerning society, and  their philosophy regarding all life. A remarkable journey-a delightful  tale.
6303148352|4.0|Pros:<br />*Amazing Effects.<br />*Good direction.<br />*Creepy!<br />*Bright and simple.<br />*The T-Rex is awesome.<br />Cons:<br />*Jeff Goldblum<br />Bottom line:Entertaining.
B00000J2KR|1.0|One of my favorite films, however the transfer to dvd is the worst I've ever seen. It is obvious this dvd was rushed out without any remastering. You don't have to be a pro to see all the defects. If you want a great  story and backdrop watch it, but beware of spending your money on something  that is not even vhs quality
B0000399WC|5.0|I've seen Papillon three or four times now, and every time I watch it, it improves. Surely this is Steve's best acting performance. The second scene in the prison cell is surely one that has been mimicked time and time again  in films over the years. Such an impression the film had on me that I have  backed a racehorse four times with the name Papillon in the last few years.  Readers in the UK will know that Papillon won the grand national this year,  no one knows how Steve never won the oscar for his performance.
B0000025HG|5.0|I like the concept, the album cover and all the love ballads included. The song &quot;Wet&quot; has some of her best word play: playful, poetic and intelligent. At the point where her voice soars you can't help but get  goose bumps. I originally purchased the album for &quot;Niagra&quot; and  &quot;Kiss Me In Rain&quot; (two of her best performances with inviting  lyrics). I wish she would do more Carole Bayer Sager material after hearing  &quot;Niagra&quot;. But to my surprise the two songs that really caught my  attention were &quot;On Rainy Afternoons&quot; and &quot;After The  Rain&quot;. &quot;On Rainy Afternoons&quot; has become my favorite  Streisand song. The lyrics, the voice, the arrangements entangle me into a  painful and wonderful past romance. I find no escape when I'm listening to  this piece. &quot;After The Rain&quot; offers a wonderful counterbalance to  the previous song: once again romance has wings and wonderment. These are  two of the Bergman's best efforts. &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; is a  nice ballad but the other five are truly five of Streisand's very best.  &quot;Splish Splash&quot;, &quot;I Ain't Gonna Cry Tonight&quot; and  &quot;No More Tears&quot; should have been on a different collection. This  would have been a perfect album had she only included love ballads. Still,  I give this album five stars because of the incredible love ballads.
B00004SVID|5.0|I`m in a bit of a rush right now, so I`ll make this short. I expected this to be good but not as good as the studio recorded version. Well, what do you know, it turned out better!   It retains most of the synchronisation as  displayed in the studio recording and for the most part does not sound very  different, but it has more energy, a lot more energy!   My particular  favorite parts are the ones preceding both the &quot;IN THE FLESH&quot;  songs, and ofcourse the slightly better solo here for comfortably numb.  Even the RUN LIKE HELL additions are great!   Definitely get this one, and  try to get the boxed set if you can.
B00004SVID|5.0|This is definately one that will hype you up, make you desperately need to see them in concert if you dont feel the need already. Just got it tonite &amp; need to go to my car where the better stereo is!  One to crank up!   This live version of Run Like Hell will give you chills.  Great sound  quality, awesome effects. Just buy it!
B000000OAH|5.0|It has been argued over the last 20 years as to which Queen album was the best.  It's likely to be argued over the next 20 years as well.  But one point most Queen fans can agree on is this; JAZZ is ONE of their best.  From  the classic pomp of \\"Bicycle Race,\\" to the tongue-in-cheek Rock  of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls,\\" To the crushing METAL of \\"Let Me  Entertain You\\" and \\"Dead On Time,\\" JAZZ covers all of the  Queen bases.  In fact, Queen was particularly adept at writing and  recording some excellent Heavy Metal songs, and \\"LMEY\\" and  \\"DOT\\" actually sound a bit (just a bit!) like Iron Maiden.  But  JAZZ is NOT a Metal album by any stretch of the imagination, it is pure  Queen.  With Rock And Roll as a launching point, this rocket flies all over  Rock-related territory; from the beautiful ballad \\"Jealousy,\\" to  the straight-ahead Rock of \\"If You Can't Beat Them,\\" to the Queen  dixieland of \\"Dreamer's Ball,\\" to the Funk of \\"Fun It,\\"  JAZZ is all over the place.  But what is amazing is how it all works  together with a cohesivenes that only Queen could achieve with an album  filled with so many different musical styles.  Then again, that is the mark  of a great Queen album.  Recommended very highly along with A NIGHT AT THE  OPERA, SHEER HEART ATTACK, and INNUENDO.
B00004SVIK|5.0|Here I thought this was going to be a double CD in one of those cheap 2 CD jewel cases. And I thought the price was a little extreme! Man was I wrong!  I recieved my copy today and was very impressed.The music is  fantastic and the packaging unbelievable.This is money well spent!
B00000JCB2|1.0|Its pretty sad to see when rock is starting to turninto. Pop-rock and rac(rock/rap) flood the airways all the time. Thiscd is another product of it. Look at the cover, it looks like sum retard spittin into a mike... KoRn only jacked themsleves up wen they met these losers. I wish Kurt Cobain would come back and help stray us back into what rock used to really be and not this trash. Same with eric wright(Eazy e)to wut rap used to be. Its not the same without these 2 legends of 2 genres of music.
B000000OR9|5.0|If you want to hear the real talent behind the best selling Whitesnake album from 1987....look no further.  This CD is incredible.  The guitar playing is fantastic....John Sykes shows that not only is he a talented  guitarist but a very good vocalist as well.  Tony Franklin has this  incredible fat, one of a kind bass sound that is just a pleasure to listen  to.  Carmen Appice does a fantastic job on drums.  This has to rate as one  of the best rock CD's from a three piece band of all time.<br />If this CD was  from Whitesnake, you would have heard this on the Radio non stop, it would  have sold 10 million copies easy.  For some of us, its a secret, but crown  jewel in our CD collections.  By far, this is one of the best Hard Rock  CD's of the 80's.  I would buy this CD over and over again.  Get out your  credit card and buy this now!
B00000DLUV|5.0|After seeing the One Night Only concert on PBS, I knew I had to have this album.  It is amazing how good the brothers sound, personally I think they sound better here, than on any other recording I've ever heard.  The album  is basically a greatest hits compilation, recorded live.  There are no  misses here, every song is a winner.  This album is a 24 song showcase, so  the higher cd price is justified.  I would have been willing to pay even  more for this wonderful collection of songs.  On a personal note, if you  have never heard the song &quot;words&quot;, you have to listen to it.  It  is one of my favorite songs of all time!
B0000009UX|5.0|The most beautiful album i have ever heard. The masterpeice? campaig was wrong, there is no question about it this album is a masterpeice. inspired and exquisite. get it. no matter the price
0893860220|5.0|I first read this book over ten years ago when I was 18 and struggling to get a grip. It lead me on a personal journey from which &quot;I&quot; never returned.
B000000W6F|4.0|Well, I just bought this album, and it is great. I love listening to it. The only problem is that I bought it 9 years after it was released. I've heard lots of their song through radio play. I decided to buy Machina,  because I really liked &quot;Stand inside your love&quot; That was a pretty  good album, but it has about 5 songs that just aren't listenable. Gish  shows a band when they were just about the music. It's just straight up  rock, with no strings attached. All of the songs are good, except for maybe  one. However, the only song that i really love here is &quot;Snail&quot;.  The others are just a good listen. If you liked their mainstream hits like  &quot;Today&quot;, you would end up wondering why you never heard this on  the radio. The rest of the songs are solid rockers, with some nice softies,  but nothing that would be heard on the radio. If you can appreciate pure  phsychadelic rock that wouldn't really make it to the mainstream, you  should like this. If you only like SP's big hits, well, you should try  downloading some songs before buying it.
0679416781|4.0|Patience is an attribute, essential for those interested in reading The English Patient. This  piece of literature is difficult to follow; However, it is well worth the endeavor. Pictures are drawn by the prolific words of the author, Michael Ondaatje. The English Patient is a portrayal of life  during and after World War II, through the eyes of four unique individuals.   This motley quartet consists of a young, Canadian nurse; a relatively  young Sikh, serving the British as a sapper (a mine-disarmer); a middle age  `thief by nature, turned spy by the war'; and a charred patient. During  their time together, congregated in a deserted Italian villa, their stories  unravel, revealing past circumstances, existing emotions, and unfolding  ambitions. Enfolded in the plot of this fictional narrative, are several  fine points of relevancy, pertaining to war.  Ondaatje intertwined  pertinent pieces of information, which served as substantial grounds from  which the setting was contrived.  In numerous cases, the author succeeded  in evoking an empathetic point of view from the reader. The tactics are  convincing, and the theme is not devoted to a complete genial complexion.   The English Patient is one I will have to read again, in favor of my  understanding.
0375501851|5.0|Salman Rushdie claims on the jacket of the british edition of White teeth that this novel &quot;has bite&quot;. Indeed it has, and it ought to worry him. For even if Zadie Smith's book is made on a recipe similar to  Rushdie's multicultural stew, her version of today's po-mo society is  definitely more tasty than what &quot;the sha of blah&quot; offered with  his overdone &quot;The Ground at Her Feeth&quot;. The plot is too elusive  to relate here, but that doesn't matter since it is the genuinly funny and  streetsmart voice of Zadie Smith that captures the reader. The Bookerjudges  can call off the search for a winner, White teeth is this year's novel, no  doubt about it. Trivia: Note the many allusions to movies such as My  Beautiful Laundrette, Goodfellas and The Godfather.
B0000009SF|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out (having kept up with Zappa releases since &quot;We're Only In It For The Money&quot;) and found it to be extremely rewarding from a musical perspective. Not being big on  listening to lyrics, this album grabbed me right away (don't worry though,  I love the song &quot;Calvin&quot;) and kept getting better all the way  through. The last three selections (originally Side 2) are like a suite,  and are so compelling that I can still listen to them repeatedly. With the  one vocal exception, this is definitive instrumental Zappa (without the  orchestra).
B00000IPAX|4.0|Blink-182 is definitely one of the better punk bands out there. I love the song What's my Age again, but I almost hate All the Small things. I think it wasn't that good and got too much publicity. They are probably my second  favorite band( behind the all-mighty Green Day ).
6305750750|5.0|George Lucas returns to his Star Wars galaxy, and craetes Episode I: The Phantom Menace.This film goes back 45 years before A New Hope, back to the days of the Old Republic and Jedi Knights. Obi Wan Kenobi is a Jedi  apprentie, and Darth Vader is a 9 year old boy who is believed to be a the  Chosen One. You must see it, and once you do, Episodes II and III will be  on your &quot;want to see&quot; list!
6301969251|3.0|This movie will bring tears to your eyes. Maybe even in the opening credits as the musical score is quite beautiful and angelic. The film appears  authentic in it's sets and dialog and Mr. Von Sydow's performance  as Jesus and Mr. Heston's performance as John the Baptist are epic.  Although it skips many significant events in the life of Jesus, it is  inspirational and quite beautiful. I wouldn't say it is a must see but you  will be better for it.
6302054982|5.0|Martin Scorcese, one of the most talented directors of his generation, delivered what many believe to be the finest gangster movie of all time.  Good Fellas, produced by Irwin Winkler, grossed $48 million and followed  the troubled life of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) from the 1950s to the 1980s.   As an Irish-Italian American affected by the rough immigrant-gangster  society in which he is raised, Hill begins to favor the celebrity lifestyle  lived by the well-respected and powerful gangsters.  The film, which took  place in New York City, won numerous Academy Award nominations.  Joe Pesci,  who played the enraged Tommy Devito, walked away with the award for best  supporting actor.  Robert DeNiro added another astonishing performance to  his marvelous acting career by playing the respected, but hostile Jimmy  Conway.    Based on Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguy, Scorcese's film  depicts the extremely dangerous, yet materialistically rewarding lifestyle  of gangsters.   He uses Hill to portray the typical, New York kid, born to  hard-working immigrant parents and demonstrates Hill as someone who simply  dreams to live the life of a wealthy, important, and well-respected  individual.  Scorcese also introduces the viewers to the deranged DeVito,  whose idea of being a gangster is more extreme than that of Hill's, as he  uses his power to become a sick, murdering maniac.  The director carries  out his agenda by portraying the somewhat chaste Hill and the psychopath  DeVito as close friends who eventually lose all that they had worked for.   Scorcese chose to punish Hill by taking away all of his materialistic  gains, which Hill has dishonestly obtained, and to smite DeVito in the  similar vengeful manner that DeVito had become accustomed to inflicting on  others.    Scorcese clearly depicts the growing wave of immigration as  he follows the lifestyles of the mighty and powerful Mafia crew in NYC.   The film describes the importance of such power in the gangsters'  lifestyles.  They receive the utmost respect from everybody, including the  politicians and wealthy business owners, and most disturbingly, destroy  anyone in their path.  The objective of gaining wealth, too, appealed to  many gangsters, as they believed that it was more rewarding to acquire  riches through stealing than through working the ordinary jobs available in  NYC.  Ethnicity played a vital role in the movie as well, as the film  represents the major differences between the different immigration groups.   The importance of being a true Italian, for example, was vital when it came  to the rules of &quot;being made,&quot; a promotion within the Mafia world.  Furthermore, Karen Hill (Loraine Bracco) and her Jewish friend proclaimed  their discomfort of dating both DeVito and Hill because both gangsters came  from non-Jewish origins.    The film, which many believe to be the  finest mob movie ever, feeds the viewer with adequate information about the  lives of gangsters. Good Fellas is surely disturbing at times, as the  violence quotient runs high; however, because the film is based on reality,  the viewer will walk away with a new perspective on gangsters and mafiosi  lifestyles.  The film also teaches the audience about the flow of  immigration and the tremendous impact it had on America then and even now.  Good Fellas displays the inability of the Italians to Americanize and,  instead,6 exhibits the affect that the Italians had over the American  society.   The viewers can detect that by bringing together the different  traditions and values, the immigrants shaped what we call the United States  today.  The film in all aspects is notably unequivocal and will continue to  progress in fame.
B000002N2P|5.0|This was the last Green Day album I bought and I love it. My favorite song is Brain Stew. I'm dissapointed that this song never got the attention it deserved. The guitar and bass in it rule! Just don't go thinking this is  better than the almighty dookie.
B00003CXCT|5.0|George Lucas is pure genious. The Star Wars saga is the most excellent piece of film I have ever seen. While a sci-fi movie, everything looks real, right down to the creatures on Tatooine, Hoth, Endor,and other  planets. The special effects are astounding, and the storyline is superb.   The story is about a boy named Luke skywalker,whom meets the old Jedi  Knight Obi Wan Kenobi, and is off to join the Rebellipn against the wicked  Galactic Empire. Mark Hamill,Carrie Fisher,Harrison Ford, Anthony  Daniels,Kenny Baker, Alec Guiness, and anybody that had something to do  with this film did great. I truly enjoyed this film, and encourage  everybody to see it.
B00000JCB2|5.0|For who is not sure whether to buy this cd or not: it is great! more than great!

0767802519|5.0|This film by Luc Besson is truly one of my favorites.  It is a story about a hitman, Leon (Jean Reno), who became an unwilling guardian to his neighbor, Mathilda (Natalie Portman), whose family was murdered by a group  of corrupt DEA agents led by Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman).<br />At first,  Leon was reluctant to take care of Mathilda because most of his life he was  alone.  When he decided to look after her, he taught her on how to become a  &quot;cleaner&quot;, while Mathilda helped him on some household chores.   She even taught him how to read (Leon is illiterate).<br />As time went on,  the two grew closer to one another.  Mathilda saw in him someone who she  can depend on while Leon saw in her a family he never had.  We can see this  in the movie when Leon told Mathilda that she gave him a taste for life.   He is now responsible for her and he will do anything to protect her.<br />I  have seen most of the films which stars Jean Reno and Natalie Portman  (Ronin, La Femme Nikita, French Kiss, Mission Impossible, Godzilla,  Beautiful Girls, Everyone Says I Love You, Mars Attacks, Heat, Episode I  The Phantom Menace, Anywhere But Here).  This film is definitely their  best.  I hope the two of them would make a movie together again, they make  a great team.

B000002B35|4.0|The version of Pulse I bought shortly after its release in 1995 has &quot;One of These Days&quot; following &quot;Another Brick&quot;. Many versions of Pulse now available omit &quot;One of These Days&quot; at the  end of the first disc. This is unfortunate since the effects-laden extended  bass solo in the middle is amazing. It's one of the few moments in which  recent live Floyd (sans Waters) outshines the studio version. The little  blinking light doesn't exactly make up for the absence. I originally bought  Pulse on cassette (don't know what I was thinking), which may explain the  inconsistancy. At any rate, other nitpicky collecters of live Floyd should  be aware of this.

0385486804|5.0|I read _Into the Wild_ before _Into Thin Air_, as a random pickup in the San Francisco airport.  It consumed me through the entire flight and regretfully was over when we landed.  It seems that some reviewers have  focused on how little sympathy they have for McCandless, the &quot;poor  little rich kid&quot; who died in the wilderness alone.  It's interesting  that the same people enjoyed Into Thin Air, which could be called a story  about a whole group of &quot;poor little REALLY rich kids.&quot;  This  isn't the way either book grabbed me.<br />Into the Wild was a fascinating  story about that mysterious quality in some people that drives them to be  as alone as possible-- away from people, away from family, away from  civilization.  We are shown with several examples (not just McCandless)  that this quality drives these people to sacrifice their belongings, their  comfort, even their personal safety in pursuit of complete solitude.  As we  see in the beginning of the book (don't worry, I'm not giving anything  away!), this compulsion often ends in death, alone and isolated.  There is  a real tragic element to the way Krakauer asks &quot;Why do they do this?   What is missing for them in life?  What are they searching  for?&quot;<br />Part of what makes the book so interesting is that Krakauer  identifies with these people, and candidly admits to having a streak of the  loner-adventurer in him.  His story and those of many other interesting,  mysterious wanderers are interwoven with the main story about McCandless.   Krakauer's personal identification with the story brings you that much  closer to the mystery, even if you've never felt the compulsion to walk out  on civilized life and leave everyone and everything behind you (how many  people haven't felt that way at some point?).<br />Comparing this book to Into  Thin Air seems inevitable considering that book's success.  I would say  Into the Wild is just as engaging, but much more personal.  It is just as  tragic but the source of the tragedy is the mysterious human character, not  really the battle against the forces of nature.  To me, Into the Wild was  powerfully interesting on a personal level, where Into Thin Air was  engaging as an adventure/disaster story.<br />I highly recommend this book.   Don't shortchange yourself on Krakauer by stopping with Into Thin Air.   Into the Wild is some of his best work!
6305127689|4.0|&quot;Top Gun&quot; is the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of movies.  When it's in the air, it's awesome, but when it's on the ground, it's pretty bad.  Because you can skip the ground scenes quite conveniently on DVD, I give  the movie on DVD 4 stars.<br />Why are the ground scenes so bad?  Tom Cruise  and Kelly McGillis have near zero chemistry, so it's almost painful  watching the formulaic antagonistic sparks between them mutate into  passion.  It happens only because the script dictates that it happen.<br />But  when the movie gets into the air, wow!  Flying scenes are often difficult  to film, because the viewer can lose perspective too easily.  Director Tony  Scott does a masterful job of always letting the viewer orient himself or  herself, so that you understand when planes are climbing or diving.<br />One  of the really startling things you can do is to watch the X-wing scenes in  &quot;Star Wars&quot; and then watch the flying scenes in &quot;Top  Gun.&quot;  You'd swear that our F-14s could wipe out squadron after  squadron of X-wings.<br />In summary, &quot;Top Gun&quot; is a must-have for  the DVD aficianado.  It's one of the movies (along with &quot;The  Matrix&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; that I use when my wife  and I have guests over and I'm in &quot;demonstration mode.&quot;
B000000H6D|2.0|I'm one of the few, the proud...a person whose into a lot of gothic, depressing music who didn't really care for this album at all. Rather than sounding dark and moody, as I hoped, it sounded like seem deep-voiced guy  who breathes too much inbetween each verse aping what he assumed depressing  and dark music should sound like. <br />I'm not saying that these guys have no  talent or that their songs aren't compelling (Black No. 1 and Christian  Woman *are* arranged pretty well), but, to me, this is like daytime soap  operas.There's all the things that should evoke feeling in me (death in the  family, somber moods, and seperation) but its presented in a way that makes  it all so melodramatic to be sapped dry of emotional content. For people  out there searching for real emotional content in their music, I suggest  they give bands like Joy Division or The Chills a good listen. The first  four or five tracks of this album are good, the rest needs tossed.
0425152251|1.0|An attempt to make philosophy entertaining for the general public is a nice idea but the story contained in this work is weak.  I kept reading only to finsh the book and found the end most disappointing. Read a philosophy text it might take just as much effort to read, but you'll find  it more rewarding.
0345404475|5.0|If you are coming to &quot;Do Androids Dream...&quot; by way of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, the film (loosely) based on the book, be warned: the two are similar only in their most basic plot outlines.  As is typical of Dick in his prolific middle period (roughly 1962-1970), there is a lot  going on in this novel.  The main theme, dehumanization, is amplified by  each character and situation, but Dick creates a rich environment that is  equally compelling as the way that theme is explored.  <br />In short, Rick  Deckard's job is to kill renegade androids, a job he finds taking its toll  on him.  Sadly, he's not the only one who is feeling dehumanized: witness  the existence of the Penfield Mood Organ (one of Dick's most touching  inventions), through which one can alter one's state of consciousness by  dialing the appropriate setting (such as &quot;the desire to watch  television, no matter what's on&quot;); witness the cult around Wilbur  Mercer, a vague messianic figure whose (literally) uphill struggle and  persecution an individual can share by grasping the handles of a little  black &quot;empathy box&quot;; witness Buster Friendly, a television  personality bent on exposing Mercerism as a sham; and, lastly, witness the  popularity of artificial animals (such as the electric sheep of the title)  in a post-apocalyptic world where most real animals are either dead or  sterile from radiation.<br />That Dick manages all of these sharply drawn  ideas (and more, as well as a number of interesting characters) while still  keeping the plot moving swiftly and ruminating on the nature of humanity is  a tribute to his brilliance.  &quot;Do Androids Dream...&quot; is not a  perfect book -- there are a few loose ends at novel's close -- but it is a  rich and rewarding one that retains its impact as the years pass.  As a  summation of several of Dick's ideas, it may also be the ideal introduction  to this author's work.<br />Jason Kruppa
B000002H33|5.0|THIS is one of the finest albums every produced, not just in the genre of thrash metal. Metallica rocked with their first two albums, but this is the album that I listen to most out of all of them. There is not a single dull  moment on this masterpiece of puppetry. All the songs are played with  lightning fast precision, and glorious heavy metal power. And yet, 1) The  songs clock in mostly between 5-12 minutes long, and 2) Amidst the mayhem  of wailing guitars and pounding drums is the sound of melody and  classically influenced arrangments and composition. This is largely in part  to bassist Cliff Burton, the most classically trained member of the band.  Sadly this would be his final album, but if he had to give a final farewell  before his sudden and unfortunate death, this album screams with a power  that engraves into the listeners' minds, &quot;Cliff was here!&quot;<br />-&quot;Battery&quot;: great acoustic intro leading into a maniacal  barage of Hetfield's harsh vocals and Ulrich's pounding drums that  literally batter their way through your ears.<br />-&quot;Master of  Puppets&quot;: a classic in the truest sense of the word. Like  &quot;Battery,&quot; this song is fast, hard, and it beckons with energy  the question of who is truly the puppet and who is the  puppeteer.<br />-&quot;The Thing that Should Not Be&quot;: again, a great  acoustic intro that leads into a hardcore thrash rhythm.<br />-&quot;Welcome  Home (Sanitarium)&quot;: the lyrics are the real gem here, telling the  story of a mental patient from inside the patient's mind. The music is  great, but the lyrics can haunt you if you're not  careful.<br />-&quot;Disposable Heroes&quot;: while I may like their later  song &quot;One&quot; better in terms of the lyrical device of the soldier's  point of view, I still give this one credit since it came first, and let's  face it...everything on this album kicks serious arse, including this  one.<br />-&quot;Leper Messiah&quot;: I could say again that this song is  fierce in its brutal greatness, but I've been saying that about every other  song, so...let's just say this is still yet another great song on this  great album.<br />-&quot;Orion&quot;: great instrumental, with a militaristic  march that echoes the gradeur of Wagner, but without being oppressive. This  is something for the Metal Militia to use as a warcry.<br />-&quot;Damage  Inc.&quot;: the intro to this song is absolutely incredible. It is my  favorite part of the song, and thus that makes it my favorite song on the  album. As a closer...it is amazing, and it has to be one of the best songs  Metallica ever recorded.<br />Top-notch production, speed-licks only Hammett  and Hetfield could dish out to give Eddie Van Halen a run for his money,  and let's face it...like I said, it is a sad, but glorious and powerful  farewell to Cliff Burton. He left us too soon. Behold his legacy! DANCE  PUPPETS!  DANCE!
0767819543|5.0|This movie was an incredibly delightful watch, that truly spoke to the viewer with FEELING. If you are a love-only sci-fi/action/suspense/thriller type, then this is definitely not for you. it contains none of that poop.  it is one of the best less publicized movies. i really could put it up  there with Life is Beautiful.
B00003OSTQ|4.0|Network is a delecious satire about the world of television . It is one of those films that remains wonderful, edgy and enjoyable after repeated viewings. What was made in 1976 as an exaggeration, is more or less an  expose by today's standards, until the final quarter of the film at  least.<br />   There is an abundance of superb acting in Network, Peter Finch  in a vibrant Oscar winning performance as Howard Beal &quot;the apocalyptic  prophet of the airways&quot;, Faye Dunaway in another oscar winning turn as  the soulless vice president, Robert Duvall as the driven upcoming suit. But  my favourite performance in the film is William Holden as Max Bracket. It  is an understated, slowburning charactrisation of a veteran news man who  despite having lived throught many years of programming is still shocked by  the exploitation of his mad friend Howard Beal. His final speech to Dunaway  is one of the most superbly executed and written scenes I've ever seen.<br />   The flaw in Network, and its a major one, is the drastic shift in tone in  its final quarter. What has been a satire with a heart for 90 minutes turns  into an all out farce. It remains funny and acute, but our sympathy for the  characters has gone. Its as if the great director Sidney Lumet and writer  Paddy Chayefsky were having too much fun, and let it effect their  judgement. Therefore the closing minutes of the film which are good on  their own terms, seem seperate from the rest of the film.<br />  Many film  fans insist that it was Rocky's popularity that brought it the 1976 best  picture oscar over Network. I don't agree, Rocky is a beautiful and  flawless one of a kind fable, and very much deserved its award. Network  however remains a terrific film, and as many reviewers pointed out, more  relevant today then it was when it came out.
0201633612|5.0|Composing an object model can be very cumbersome. Different approaches let to different results, bound to undesired limits. The use of design patterns has two benefits. One: A less strict view, taking into account other basic  forms and two: a flying start when discussing interaction and interfaces.  The authors of this book discuss 23 different design patterns which are at  a generic level and cover a very complete process. In stead of start to  view the processes from scratch, a good understanding of the design  patterns help to recognize structure in the object models. Although I  didnot catch all the patterns (might be because the examples are to low  level for me, to close to operating system like behavior) this book helped  me in defining objects and looking in a more structural way to the  different processes.
B000002MTU|4.0|I have to agree with some of the critics -- Clapton does an excellent job and his technical skills shine in this album, but the vocals do seem a bit forced.  However, this was the first blues album I ever owned, and I was  hooked on blues from the first time I ever played it, years ago.  I still  listen to it regularly.  The primary virtues of this album are (a) better  insight into Eric Clapton himself, and (b) an ideal introduction to the  glory of blues music for those who haven't been exposed to it before.  Like  I said, I now own a collection of blues music by &quot;authentic&quot;  blues masters, but I still enjoy listening to Cradle.  You won't be  disappointed.  His guitar work rocks.
0812523334|5.0|&quot;Little Women&quot; is my favorite book of all time.  I love all of Louisa May Alcott's books dearly, and I seem to keep coming back to this one.  Who cannot laugh with the Alcott sisters when Jo burns Meg's hair off?  Who cannot shed at least a few tears when sweet, gentle Beth dies?   Whose heart cannot be ripped apart in agony when Jo rejects Laurie's  declaration of love for her?  This book is a masterpiece.  It's a role  model - an encourager.  To the person who said that the Marches were the  &quot;perfect&quot; family - I dearly hope to have a family as good as they  when I grow up.  I feel like the Marches are my family!  Read the book.   You won't regret it, I promise you.
6304698623|5.0|If you are familiar with the classic children's novel of the same title, you may find this film adaptation to be lacking. But, when you watch the movie on its own, it is an absolutely lovely and charming film that is  appropriate for any age. I originally skipped this movie in the theatres  because it was billed as a &quot;children's film&quot; and I'm sorry I  missed it on the big screen. <br />Some other reviewers have remarked upon  some problems with the acting. With the exception of some caricatures in  characterization with the adult roles, I didn't have any problems with that  aspect of the production. Liesel Matthews does a bang up job in the lead as  Sara Crewe and I hope she has a long and successful career.<br />As far as  extras are concerned, there aren't a lot on this DVD. There's no commentary  track but you do get both a pan &amp; scan and a widescreen version. There  are both French and Spanish soundtracks and captioning as well as three  theatrical trailers and some production notes. This is a very well produced  disc for the price and a good value.
B000002TQV|5.0|I am not going to pretend to be some music guru who knows all about how music &quot;should&quot; sound.  I do know, however, that this CD is Radiohead's best.  It has all you can handle from loud, hard  beats to  serene melodies.  Anyone who'd say this CD is sub-par needs a crack to the  skull (or just doesn't know good music when she/he hears it).  This is a  must buy for any CD collector; you won't be disappointed, I promise.  If  you check this one out I would definitely recommend the other two Radiohead  releases Pablo Honey and Ok Computer.
B00003CXCK|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS NOT A HISTORY LESSON.<br />But then again, the greatest history is not taught, but felt, to coin a cliche.<br />The screenwriters of this film may have taken license with Schindler and Goeth and the myriad other  figures.  So what?   Should we watch Holocaust movies for character  studies?  NO.<br />We can like the characters, but the heart of this  beautiful, beautiful film is its power to convey how it was to live in that  time and place.<br />If Schindler was not corrupt but ultimately redeemed in  the exact way as in the film...  I do not care.  He represents a flawed  decency unlike many characters possess in films.  He is real, even if he is  not the real Oskar Schindler.<br />If Goeth was not such a monster...  Oh  well.  The character, portrayed wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes, represented  evil in its purest.  Watching this film made me despise such hate more than  years of Hitler demonizing could--it made me realize that there is such  evil.<br />This film was not a character film.  It was not an Academy Award  film shoe-in.  And if Spielberg did win, it was because the Academy finally  realized his talent--but only when they couldn't refuse it.  This film  couldn't lose because it was the best picture of the year(and many others,  I'd say).<br />Watch this film and feel.  Don't think until it and your  reaction to it are over.
0141301066|5.0|Matilda is a story which any child would like. If you have seen the movie you will know thta it is the story about how this brainy child saves her teacher from getting caught up in a dead end. This is nothing like the movie though for one reason. It is miles better. It captures the imagination and everyone can look like what you want htem to look like.  This book gives you a better indication of how Miss Trunchball really  looks. This is a great book from Roald Dahl. But most of his books are.  This is good because it keeps the excitement going and lets imaginations  run wild.
B00003CWPR|1.0|DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! This movie is rated incorrectly.  There should be a better warning of it lewd content.  Beware, this is a horribly written/directed movie which belongs among the ranks of B-Playboy flicks  for the sexually frustrated, devoutly immoral persons.
B0000057C5|5.0|sehnsucht is the 1st rammstein cd i purchased. i loved it immediately even though the only song i was familiar with was du hast. this cd is more techno/pop than herzeleid but it still drips with the dark ominous mood  that is rammstein. forget all the other metal bands this is the new  yardstick by which they all should be measured !
0453008097|5.0|Howards End is one of my favourite novels. I find myself applying it's quiet little lessons to my life rather often and have gotten to know it's wonderfully winding structure of a story quite intimately. What amazes me is that I am even more fond of the novel since having heard it read by Emma  Thompson on a rather long road trip.<br />There were several others sharing a  car, some of whom freely admit that they might never have picked up the  book or seen the film had it not been for the book-to-tape adaption of this  novel. We actually listened to it twice and all agreed the the wonderful  story was made even more wonderful and lively by Emma Thompson's wonderful  way of reading and her witty of portrayal each character.<br />If you've  grown tired of this story, Forster or literature in general, I highly  recommend a road trip with these tapes!
B000003RCY|5.0|this cd is even better than sehnsucht. this is german metal without a peer. heavy, loud, menancing, you will be swept up in it's dark, angry, menacing vocals and throbbing riffs. rammstein is down right scary and so  compelling that i listen to nothing else.
B000001EPB|4.0|The CD was great. I was really disappointed though.  One of the greatest pieces in the show wasn't on it. The first fiddle section wasn't included in the soundtrack. Almost like a battle of the violists, those two girls  were so amazing and the music itself was awesome. If I could change the CD  at all, the only thing I would do would be to add another track! Otherwise,  I wouldnt change a thing.
B000023X9W|5.0|You have to spin this CD at the end of the day when you have forty minutes to relax.  On the whole, these songs are beautiful and gentle, with Ben Keith's steel guitar softly singing behind Neil.  It's also a true album --  after listening to it, you'll feel like the songs have melted together.   The best tracks -- if I can even choose -- are &quot;Distant Camera,&quot;  the title track, and &quot;Good to See You&quot;.  &quot;Buffalo  Springfield Again&quot; (a song that's better than you'd expect from the  name) has a great little acoustic riff, too.  Don't expect this album to  floor you, but it's so simple and beautiful that I find it impossible to  resist.  More solid than Harvest, in my opinion.
B0000057C5|1.0|this band sorrowly is a part of german culture, this is a fact, but I think it is really bad stuff, in ideas and forms. the lyrics are really very stupid, some kind of esoteric-neuheidnisch-neofashistic.  dont buy  anything of rammstein, I do not want to understand why they are so popular  in u.s., you cant be so less intellectual
630575067X|5.0|Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace<br />After all the hype and the crazily varied reviews, the real question is whether The Phantom Menace is up there amongst its' three predecessors as one of the best films of all  time or a pale imitation of its relations. The answer: neither. Phantom  Menace isn't up to standards of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back or  Return of the Jedi. A millions details irritate and niggle. The acting is  sometimes flat, Jar Jar is irritating and incomprehensible and the plot  adheres to tightly to the conventions of the past films. At one point the  same sequence of events is repeated twice (there is indeed always a bigger  fish) and the force has now been revealed to be a bunch of tiny parasites  who give birth to the chosen one - it kind of loses its mistique doesn't  it! I also feel that the promotional material (and there was a lot of it!)  ruined much of the films' appeal. For example, in the film, Darth Maul only  reveals his two bladed lightsaber at the end of the film, but due to all  the promotion we all knew about it already. So does this all mean that it  was a bad film? Far from it. Although a slight disappointment for a Star  Wars film, in its own right it's bloody excellent. Each of the weaker  performances are matched by great turns from Natalie Portman and Ian  McDiarmid, and, though I could have done without Jar Jar, Anakin's owner,  the other computer animated character in the film, looks and acts  brilliantly and sits next to Palpatine as the best character in the movie.  The lightsaber battles are incredible, and Darth Maul is amazing to watch.  The computer effects, far from detracting from the story, are brilliant to  watch and effective within the plot. The huge council chamber is  particularly notable for being mindblowingly awe-inspiring.  John Barry's  score is powerful and memorable, cleverly both touching on the Star Wars  theme and going in new directions at the same time. The film works best  when the viewer is familiar with the originals, both because of the nods to  events in the future, and because of the sheer sense of excitement when the  Star Wars prolouge scrolls up the screen. So it seems fair to say that this  is not the unfaultable work of art that the other three Star Wars' were,  but it is still one of the best fims I have ever seen. Can't wait for  Episode 2. Hint: watch to the very end of the credits to hear a little  referral of what is to come.<br />9 out of 10.
6300215954|5.0|A fine combination of action, romance, comedy and the battle of the sexes.  Wonderfully scored by Henry Mancini and with the Mancini touch, capturing every mood and lifting the action and suspense.
B000002U8A|4.0|&quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; is in close tie with Duran Duran's first LP in being my favourite effort from the band; I just can't decide which one I like better. There are only two songs on this album I really  don't like(&quot;I Take the Dice&quot; and &quot;Cracks in the  Pavement&quot;).  Both songs sound too corny. But this LP is sort of a  mixture of different types of songs. &quot;Reflex&quot;, &quot;Union of the  Snake&quot;, and &quot;Seventh Stranger&quot; are awesome..being three of  Duran Duran's best songs. &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot;, &quot;Of Crimes  and Passion, and &quot;Shadows on Your Side&quot; come across as a little  overproduced...but I still love them and never want to skip them over when  listening to the cd.  I recommend this album for old and new-comer Duran  fans.
B00001OH7P|5.0|From the conclusion of the first song, when Bowie staggers out of hearing, screaming &quot;Five Years&quot;, to the end, when he does likewise screaming &quot;You're wonderful&quot;, a tremendous amount of energy is  expended on the listener to great effect. I have no idea what it must have  been to see Bowie perform these songs live, but if their recorded versions  are diluted versions of the stage-show, then that really must have been  something.<br />I have to be honest that I do not entirely understand the  story of this album, but I am content to live out the rest of my life  enjoying the music and the occasional snippets of lyrics that make sense -  most famously, stuff like &quot;making love with his ego&quot; on the title  track, or &quot;time takes a cigarette and puts it in your mouth&quot;.  Bowie has a real ear for dark yet pleasing lyrics, and part of his musical  genius is when he puts in some musically weaker songs like Hang on to  Yourself because they make sense within the lyrical context of the album.<br />I'm sure some people like that song - I find it a bit annoying - but  more important than my or their opinions on that individual track, this  album really works as a whole (whatever I understand by its overall  meaning! - I understand the beginning and end...but am a bit hazy in the  middle), and to take any song out would reduce the quality of the package.  That is what I call musical genius, and this is the product of one such  artist.<br />I am only familiar with Bowie's 70's stuff, and this is  certainly the most important album he did. I find some of his other music  more interesting, such as Cygnet Committee on Space Oddity...but this is  the album I always return to, because it does lead you from a beginning to  an end with a lot of vigour, some excellent melodies (Star Man, Lady  Stardust), and not a little sense of humour.<br />And the album sleeve is  great for some of the absolutely mad photos...
0201485672|5.0|After reading this book I'm a changed programmer.  I have always thought good code was important, but never had a very good way of insuring that my code was well written and tested.

B00000DQT7|5.0|I don't know about greatest album ever...but this album has a strong sense of timelessness about it which neatly transports it out of musical debates. I mean, these guys are just enjoying themselves so much, how can you not  have fun listening along?<br />That's fairly naive, and I can tell you one  thing - the music is most certainly not. There is a lot of very  sophisticated stuff going on here, and some thrilling tunes. Each member of  the Band played about three or four instruments, and between them they  create such a sense of craftsmanship...yet you still want to sing along to  such brilliant tunes as Across the Great Divide or especially the Night  They Drove Old Dixie Down - my favourite, a mournful song which still  retains that sense of fun which runs throughout the album.<br />However much  you like the album as a whole, there are songs here for everyone, from Rag  Mama Rag, which you will struggle to resist jumping up and bopping along  with, to the last - King Harvest, another &quot;heavy&quot; track. The  vocal range of these guys, and their perfectly pitched harmonies are  awe-inspiring...<br />and the best adjective I can think of is feel-good.  &quot;If everyone had more feel-good albums...&quot; - I'm sure you can  complete the sentence. Well, this is a great place to start.
6304698526|4.0|This has the greatest chase scene ever.  I like the fact that it is a realistic movie.
0792153367|5.0|I Absolutely LOVED this movie! The Main Charecter Holly Golightly is so sweet and caring and sooooo complex! I have seen the movie a over and over and I still can't figure her out. She is never one dimensional. She always  has depth and is never perdictable. She the moment you see her on the  screen you fall in love with her. She is warm and open and never fake! She  has sooo much Charisma! I just can't say enough about this movie and about  Holly. You will just have to see it your self!
B000002LR3|4.0|Screamadelica is the album that set the pace for quality blends of hardcore rock and basement dance in the years to come.  It hasn't dated at all, in fact, it sounds more relevant now than it did upon release.  A  drug-influenced album (obviously) that rarely falters and is surprisingly  coherent in its madness, taking chances with a variety of styles.

0871137380|5.0|I'm reading this book right now and I love it, and its not the typical book for me to read either.  I got an autographed copy of the book from my school's bookstore (makes sense since I do go to a military school).  I was  invited to the Military Writer's Symposium that my school does every year  and I meet Mark Bowden.  He has encouraged me to write and do what I love  to do.  He's a super nice guy and his book is great.  Hope that you read it  an enjoy it.

0515127485|1.0|Having enjoyed Mr.Harris's imaginative and finely-observed &quot;Fatherland&quot; I came to this present work with high expectations (indeed I reserved it for light holiday reading in a remote part of Thailand). It was a major disappointment to find that this new novel is  turgid and contrived. It doesn't help that it is burdened with a principal  character (one hesitates to say &quot;hero&quot;) who is that most  hackneyed clich&eacute; of the modern thriller, in print or on celluloid, the  dishevelled and hard-drinking womaniser. The writer's familiarity with  modern Moscow is milked for every incidental detail possible and the  linkages back to late Stalinist time are laboured to say the least. By the  hundredth page I gave up in sheer boredom, totally uninterested in the  further plot development or in the outcome. Can this be the same novel I  read such rave reviews of? Thank Heavens I had other reading material with  me on my holiday!
B000001Y2U|4.0|Marilyn Manson unleashes an industrial playground with Antichrist Superstar, an aural sensory overload that writhes in its doom and gloom.

B000007T1M|5.0|I was turned onto System of A Down by another person, and he has turned me into a monster.  When I first heard the song &quot;Sugar&quot; I was kinda turned off by the wacky singing by singer Serj, but after many other  listens it wears on you, and you have to keep listening.<br />This is some of  the hardest sounding rock I've heard in a while.  All I can say is, if you  remotely like bands such as Tool, Korn, or even Rage Against the Machine,  you will LOVE System of A Down's self titled debut.  Get it while it's  still hot.
B000002KO1|5.0|The Pretender's first LP is one of the single greatest debut albums ever.  Chrissie Hynde snarls when she wants to and doesn't feel the need to paint herself into a struggling female, instead a strong human.  The Pretenders  don't paint within the lines, instead coloring their first album with a  range of influences from ballsy punk (&quot;Precious&quot;) to vampy  R&amp;B (&quot;Brass In Pocket&quot;).  Few albums make punk rock this  accessible and immediately appealing.  One of the greatest of all time and  a massive entry in the rock and roll history books. Best tracks:  &quot;Precious,&quot; &quot;Kid,&quot; &quot;Stop Your Sobbing,&quot;  &quot;Brass In Pocket&quot; Rating: 10/10
B000002UVZ|5.0|R.E.M.'s career divides neatly into two phases (so far) - the I.R.S. years, when they were college radio darlings, and the Warner Bros. years when they became a household name. &quot;Life's Rich Pageant&quot; is  arguably their best work of the I.R.S. phase. Harder-edged than  &quot;Murmur&quot; and &quot;Reckoning&quot;, the songs have a new clarity,  in part due to the up-front treatment on Michael Stipe's vocals. From the  opening guitar of &quot;Begin the Begin&quot; this is the sound of a band  reaching their peak. (I should say one of their peaks, but this album  captures them at their hard-rocking best.) For all the ferocity of songs  like &quot;Just a Touch&quot; there are some lovely quieter moments as well  - &quot;The Flowers of Guatemala&quot;, &quot;Swan Swan H&quot; in  particular. &quot;Underneath the Bunker&quot; reveals a side of the band  often overlooked - their sense of humor (fully realized on &quot;Dead  Letter Office&quot;). <br />Of all the R.E.M. albums I own, &quot;Life's Rich  Pageant&quot; is the one that spends the most time on the CD changer and it  still sounds great.
B00000AFWW|5.0|Celebrity Skin, perhaps the finest album to come out of the latter nineties and undoubtedly Hole's biggest and best to date, is a rarity in that it combines a plethora of moods and threads them together with  luminous sonic-splendored arrangements and unabashed honesty.  Hole's  combination of up-in-flames guitar riffs and subtle sweet hooks are the  backdrop to Courtney Love's scathing and bare vocals...  Few artists can  darken the light the way Hole can, as evidenced in &quot;Boys On the  Radio,&quot; a shining poppy rock cut that would first seem a blissful  anthem but further analysis indicates a complicated and tragic love story  of desperation and loneliness.  The brilliant and oft-haunting songs come  together to reinvent the quintessential California love/hate story, this  time humanizing it through honest confession and ironic obsession in a way  only Hole could execute. Best tracks: &quot;Malibu,&quot; &quot;Playing  Your Song,&quot; &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; Rating: 10/10
0679720200|5.0|This book is certainly one of the most powerful of the last century. It is a product of a philosophical movement which is sweeping in its scope and depth. This book is interesting in literary terms, but probably should not be studied without some knowledge about the existentialism of Camus and  Sartre. Highly recommended...
B00000AFGM|3.0|Mechanical Animals is Marilyn Manson's reckless abandonment of industrial grind for stadium-friendly glam.  Strangely enough, Marilyn (the person) fits the role of post-Bowie androgyny like a glove and he belts out  apocalyptic attacks on human shallowness.  The production is muddled and  the songwriting is uneven, but it's an interesting piece of melodrama for  the new millennium.

0553573403|5.0|I bought this book when there was a bit of a drought of good fantasy novels on the market, or at least there seemed to be. Martin sets an excellent scene in this first of the series and then proceed's to leave me wondering if i ever read a better Science Fiction novel. I have read very  good novels in the past where the story is split by the concurrent goings  on of several characters only to feel that i want to skip a chapter to move  to the more exciting goings on of another character. This was not the case  with this one. I eagerly await his second. Tell truth i already read it,  and am eagerly awaiting the third :_)
B000001FSP|4.0|Most popular music is meant to be entertaining. You can enjoy it while pedaling a stationary bicycle, play it in the background during a friendly barbecue, or perhaps pick a few tunes for a wedding reception. Broken  English is not entertaining, and I wouldn't recommend it for any of the  these situations.<br />Marianne Faithfull chooses to exorcise her demons on  Broken English. Her voice is one of raw conviction: anguished and wasted.  Heavy on the synthesizer and Euro-dance tempo, the music is deceptively  comforting. The lyrics, on the other hand, are vindictive and desperate.  The album opens with the menacing bass lines of `Broken English': an angry  anti-war cry. The light acoustic guitars and romantic melodies of `Witches  Song' hide the anguish of isolation. Depression and drugs are the center of  the loathsome `Guilt.' Again, on `The Ballad Of Lucy Jordan,' the light  staccato synthesizer notes and tender melody conceal this composition's  fatal conclusion. The severe guitar crashes on `Working Class Hero' are as  potent as Marianne's condemnation of Puritan ethics. The closing song `Why  D'Ya Do It' is a vulgar throwaway - the pornographic descriptions reek of  junior high school sex humor. Broken English is a crude and disturbing saga  by a lady precariously balanced on the edge of a straight razor. Play this  with the lights on.

B000007OY0|5.0|Not much to say about a film so good. Frank Darabont is an absolute genius and the film itself is a masterpiece. The actors are in the film 100%. Everything is in place, it's part of this great composition. The music is  great. Ok... the story's not so genuine, but beside this it's an absolute  classic for everyone, (Except for those who don't watch hard movies)
B00004STPT|5.0|This soundtrack is incredible.  It is highly epic with a lot of build up and releases in the music.  I have no idea if the film supports this, but the music definatly tells a story on its own.  I highly recommend it!
B00004RFDW|5.0|The film is amazing, that's for sure. Some people say it's too long and stuff but I think that's stupid. It has to be long. Nothing is out of action. And what about Russel Crowe?  He showed the best performance in  the year cheek by jowl with Denzel Washington. Anyone upbraiding this film  is wrong.
B000002JEV|4.0|I have long been an advocate of &quot;Song Remains The Same&quot;,  Zeppelin's other live album.  It's polished to the point of calculated versions of stadium filling Zeppelin was, and still is one of my favorite  albums of all time.<br />So upon first listening to this immense collection of  almost bootleg quality live early recordings,  I was kinda put off.  But  after a few times listening,  I began to weed out all the filler that this  150+ minute set contains.  And what was left was actually quite  powerful.<br />In contrast to the &quot;tired but proud&quot; performances on  &quot;Song Remains&quot;,  BBC boasts several firewalled and shakey  performances of pre-superstardom Zeppelin.<br />You keep waiting for all the  wheels to come falling off,  but they never do.  This is pure energy.  They  are months away from all the money and fame, and what you hear is the  hunger.  <br />So while, &quot;Song Remains the Same&quot; will always have  the nostalgia value to me,  I have to recommend this one over it.  It's the  &quot;real&quot; Zeppelin.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Very widely considered to be the best of all four Alien films, Aliens is one of the few sequels to actually top the original.  For sci-fi action, suspense, and special effects (not to mention what is quite possibly the  best alien creature ever created--the queen), this film hovers near the  very top of the science fiction list of greats.  Even those with four other  copies of the film on the shelf (like me) will find the DVD a  must-buy-at-any-cost:  restored footage, interview, photo galleries, and  some other bells and whistles make this one of the most detailed DVDs I  have seen for any movie.  Better yet, buy the Alien Legacy set.  But if you  only buy one, you just found it!
0790739909|5.0|&quot;City of Angels&quot; is not really about angels nor is it a conventional love story.  Rather, it is a film of colors, archetypes, symbols and dreams.  It is a meticulously constructed filmplay on healing the soul, finding wholeness and spirituality within, accepting what you may not like about yourself, and integrating parts of yourself you may have hidden or put on hold for a while (especially while building a career).  <br />Much symbolism in the film comes from mythology and early Christianity (particularly Gnosticism).  Folks who have gone through analysis -- particularly Jungian -- probably see many of the symbols and archetypes immediately.  Religious studies professors may be intrigued or intellectually chagrined by the allusions to Gnosticism.  But even those of us with such backgrounds will need to see the movie several times before all the images bubble to the surface of consciousness! <br />The film is heavily laden with symbolism.  It drips with it.  For me, discovering all the layers turned into a puzzle requiring Jungian-type amplification (digging into the meaning of everything). I am not, however, going to give hints to discovering the &quot;secret knowledge&quot; hidden in the film.  One must experience it oneself (a basic Gnostic belief, I have learned).<br />The good news -- after deconstructing this film beyond reason, I still love it.  I love the music (especially the chanting of &quot;Angelus&quot; as Seth &quot;falls&quot;).  The archetypes, symbols and hidden meanings do not detract from the story.  The story remains is a thing in itself-- a unity.  The hidden content does not change the meanings either, but rather allows the viewer a (separate) deeper understanding of human relationships and the healing of the soul.<br />I recommend this film to psychology and religious studies professors, who could challenge students to find the Gnostic Christian, mythological and Jungian content. <br />By the way, a deeply Christian viewer need not fear watching the film because of the Gnostic symbolism.  The screenwriter(s) clearly place their interpretation of Gnosticism within monotheism and Godliness.  There is no evil (no Satan)-- only the shadow figure which all humans carry within.  <br /> Maggie is not the reason Seth has &quot;fallen.&quot; Both Seth and Maggie are incomplete human beings. They fall in love -- a very magical, profound love -- as mirror images of hidden parts of themselves.  At the end, we see that Maggie integrates Seth-ness into herself, and Seth integrates Maggie-ness into himself.  And, not to spoil your own journey of discovery, I will leave it at that.<br />This is a very profound film.  Unfortunately it was beyond the critics and everyone else who knights and awards great films.
6303542352|5.0|Francis Urquhart (commonly referred to by his initials) seeps into the pores and is impossible to remove, even after repeated handwashings.  The exquisitely written script propels one into the murky realms of moral  ambiguity--whose side are you on, anyway?
B000002U82|5.0|I'm 16, and I had never heard a Pink Floyd song, with theexception of &quot;Money&quot;, before purchasing this album. It was aleap of faith, that purchase, not knowing quite what I was getting into. However, I found one of the greatest albums I have ever heard, with beautiful instrumentation and often profound lyrics. But the flow of the album is what really sets it apart. It seems like one long, unfolding journey rather than simply a collection of songs. Each song runs into the next in a very subtle way, so you end up listening to the entire album without even realizing it. Highly recommended!
0780629450|3.0|Although it may seem stingy to rate this film at only 3 stars given the amount of work that went into it, it has a number of problems, the length of it being number 1.  Hamlet is very seldom run in its entire length, and  Branagh has, here, graphically demonstrated why....By the time the last  sword fight arrives, the audience doesn't care anymore who wins!       Although it was good to see the Freudian view of Hamlet and Gertrude  abandoned, Julie Christie is such a boring Gertrude that it's a wonder  Claudius wanted her enough to cross the road much less commit murder.   Winslet has none of the fire to her madness that Bonham-Carter exhibited in  the Zefarelli version, and Branagh's Hamlet is never more correct than when  he says, &quot;what an ass am I&quot;...He's mean spirited, brooding, and  utterly uninspiring...unlike Gibson, he has no intention of winning this  battle, he is only out for revenge before his doom.  What a bore.      And  one more thing...where does Branagh get off claiming that Hamlet was 30?   That is so ridiculous!   If Hamlet were of legal age, he would have  inherited the throne upon his father's death.  Hamlet is traditionally  viewed as underage, although mature actors always play him because of the  intricasy of the part.
0373834454|3.0|I'm new to Heyer's work -- but understand her legendary position in the world of romantic fiction. I did not enjoy this book as much as the two recent rereleases (&quot;Frederica&quot; and &quot;The Nonesuch&quot;). For  one thing, other than a show of pluck at the start of the book, the heroine  comes off as a  self-absorbed, ninny. She spends most of the book gambling,  overspending, and running with a bad crowd. In fact, it is impossible to  see what the Earl of Rule -- an interesting hero -sees in this girl. Heyer  spends little time developing the relationship between the two and much too  time on the slapstick antics of Horry's brother and drunken friends. One  never really understands the motivation of the villan in the novel and  understands even less why the Earl has a trust in Horry which she never  seems to earn. The end of the book has a brief excerpt from the next novel  to be released, &quot;Cousin Kate.&quot; I suggest waiting until then.
