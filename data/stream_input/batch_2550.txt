0783240287|4.0|I haven't watched it yet, but looking forwrd to as I know Robert Torti who plays Potifer. I know the music as well and I know I will enjoy listening/watching it.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The set is an excellent combo. Should have bought it when it first came out. Always loved the movie and now my grandkids can sing and enjoy it, too.
B004H83IG4|5.0|I just received this movie.  I have viewed it before.  But because it is such a good story, I had to have it in my library.
0307277887|3.0|I watched 6 seasons before getting this book, and I was kind of dissappointed by it.  It may not have been the case if I read the book first, but I think the personalities of the characters are all quite a bit different from the show.  I figured I'd try it, but I think I'm going to stick with the show.
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|The acting was very good and I enjoyed watching this movie.  Recommend for anyone who enjoys a story with twists and turns.
B007NVJ7NU|2.0|Who was disappointed in this movie. I just couldn't get into things even though I understood what they were attempting to do with the story. Mildly interesting camera work and visuals I guess, but the whole movie left me more bored than questioning anything at the end. It could be one of those movies you have to see two or three times and catch yourself in just the right frame of mind to get blown away by it. I doubt I'll bother with a second viewing. I typically like a wide range of films and film types, but have to add this one alongside Brazil as one of the &#34;Movies that are acclaimed for reasons I'll never understand&#34; pile.
193700788X|4.0|I know there have been a lot of people disappointed with this final Sookie book, but I'm not one of them. There have been plenty of reviews already discussing the various plot points, etc. so I won't rehash them here. Suffice to say I really enjoyed the book & will miss Sookie & her world! Thanks, Charlaine.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you are not an American Horror Story fan you must not have seen any of the series. Season one or two. Amazing characters and performances by Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy and others along with terrific writing makes this one of the best new shows to come along in years. It's a blend of horror, drama, dark comedy at times and is a show that isn't afraid to not take itself seriously all the time. If you spot any cheese, it's delicious cheese. In the perfect slice. Just a dash of camp maybe? Overall the stories connect to bring the series together, yet the episodes tend to have a theme or stand on their own story to tell also. You don't have to watch season one to pick up this season as they are not connected. But it is refreshing for fans of the show that the actors are reappearing in upcoming seasons re-written into new roles.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book and do not fault the author for taking the story past three books.  I loved everything about Entwined including that Ava has finally learned to trust and that she and Gideon are moving into a mature adult relationship considering they have not been surrounded by the best adult role models.  There are so many things that can happen because there are so many villains and potential villains that I'm finally starting to realize these books will make great TV.  I just hope the series lands on HBO or Showtime so the adult situations can be more accurately portrayed.  Finally, shame on the haters who rated this book before reading based on a price point that according to published reports the author did not control.  Shame on the haters who are jealous the author got a TV deal for her work.  Well done Sylvia Day, I look forward to book 4 AND 5.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good graphics, decent story, still don't think it was worth the five dollar price tag for it, but not much to be done about it now.
B00969PR18|2.0|App needs updates and revision. Can't map a trip with multiple stops. Can't seem to get it to print out a map to paper. Wish I had my money back. I submitted comments on this before but never heard a thing back from anyone.

B000NQRE1E|5.0|My mom loves Titanic and has the VHS, DVD, HDDVD, and now this Blu-Ray edition. Finally completed her collection. She rates this 5 stars and that says a lot coming from a Titanic fanatic that isn't easy to please!<br /><br />Would definitely recommend to a friend.

B003RV43X4|4.0|I love this Greek myth..definitely produced for guys though.  Lots of fighting and violence. Great special effects and great actors!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I just watched this famous film for the first time in my life and I LOVED IT! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS!<br /><br />In this 1944 film we meet the financially comfortable Smith family, which lives in the good city of St. Louis, Missouri. The year is 1904, and all city talks only about World's Fair which will open towards the end of the year. The head of family, Alonzo Smith (Leon Ames), is a very busy lawyer. His wife, Anna Smith (Mary Astor) watches over the five children: one son, Lon Jr (who soon goes to college) and daughters Rose, Esther, Agnes and \\"Tootie\\".<br /><br />The daughters are the focus of the film. Rose (Lucille Bremer) is the oldest of all children and all family worries that in her middle 20s she is not yet married. Esther (Judy Garland) is barely 18 and she is desperately in love with their neighbour, a rather handsome but shy young man. Tomboyish and cat loving Agnes (Joan Carroll) is in her early teens. And last but not least there is \\"Tootie\\" (Margaret O'Brien), a delicious chatterbox aged seven, afraid of nothing, always looking for more mischief and trouble - and having a VERY special relationship with her dolls...)))<br /><br />Finally, there is also the ancient and wise, but still cheerful and young at heart Grandpa Smith (Henry Davenport) and the aging maid Katie (Marjorie Main), who is actually more like an extra family member.<br /><br />This film is a delicious story, merry, happy, heart warming and with excellent songs. All actors gave the maximum of what they could give and the director and scenarist did also an amazing job. At the end of the film, all is well in the best of the worlds - and it is good to see this kind of movie from time to time...<br /><br />Judy Garland shines in this film brighter than she ever did, so full of wit and joy of life she is. Small wonder that the director of the film, Vincente Minelli, ultimately fell in love with her -they were married one year later and Liza Minelli was born as the result in 1946...<br /><br />But all great as she is in this film, even Judy Garland was OUTSTAGED by 7 years old Margaret O'Brien, who plays \\"Tootie\\" - she actually got an Oscar for this role, an Academy Juvenile Award, the same prize Judy Garland got five years earlier for \\"Wizard of Oz\\". Rarely was an award so much deserved... Sadly it was also the only Oscar this wonderful film obtained, even if it was desservedly nominated four times.<br /><br />Bottom line, I absolutely loved this film and I will keep it preciously for future viewing. Enjoy!born as the result in 1946...<br /><br />But all great as she is in this film, even Judy Garland was OUTSTAGED by 7 years old Margaret O'Brien, who plays \\"Tootie\\" - she actually got an Oscar for this role, an Academy Juvenile Award, the same prize Judy Garland got five years earlier for \\"Wizard of Oz\\".

0385349947|5.0|If you're a woman in the working world this book is a must read. It is targeted for women of all ages and raises our awareness of the role we are playing in our own lives. Sheryl's ideas go far beyond leaning into ones career but rather leaning into who you are as an individual and what you can offer for the future. I appreciate her balance of documented research combined with her own personal experience. I promise, once you start reading you will not be able to put it down. I plan to recommend this to all of my clients.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I thought it was a bad enough dealing with the moved release date but dragging on this series with a weak ending is extremely disappointing for this accomplished author.  I absolutely loved book one, liked book two and thought three was a just ok with an ending that was the weakest of the150+<br /> books in this genre I have read.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I was kind of worried after the last two Sookie books were kind of disappointing that this last book might be a bust. Honestly I really enjoyed the book!! I hate to see the series end but it went out with a bang and was a happy ending for everyone of the main characters! Can't wait to read some of Charlaine Harris' other novels!
B00881VLCE|2.0|It's an ok app not as nice looking as others. Doesn't always work and freezes a lot. The HD ones are better.
B0089OBLDO|5.0|I bought this solely to use a wired PS3 controller on my Xbox 360 for fighting games, and it works perfect. No problems, all I did was plug it in and it worked. Need both a wired Xbox 360 controller and a wired PS3 controller for it to work.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I'm a young guy with a taste for electronic music. My mom is not. I was listening to LS one day and thought this could actually bridge the gap between music I would listen to and music my mom would listen to. I got it for her as a gift and she loves it. I don't think she would appreciate me driving her around while listening to Feed Me or Skrillex or Rusko or Knife Party or Porter Robinson or Nero in the car now, but you get the point.<br /><br />Likewise, to parents: this is good music that is well-composed, cool and has no swear words. Consider it for any children who like electronic music or play the violin.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have been counting down the days for the release. I loved the book but with Sylvia I don't think I could ever hate any of her work. The only thing I didn't like about the book was how it ended.  Other then that I thought it was a awesome book could not put it down.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Hours of viewing ahead. I love Star Trek, Just great for the long winter nights and when you just need some Captain Kirk.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very fun!  I just wish they would leave facebook out of it.  But, it is addicting and a good time wasting game.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I have to agree with the three other writers above me about this series so far. Martin has closing issues. I won't read any more in this series unless he can weave a coherent integrated plot that ties the characters together. Very disappointed.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|This was the movie that had sparked my newly revived interest in the classics. It is also the first movie that I watched with a very dear friend of mine who is sadly no longer with me.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|it didn't guess my character even after 80 guesses in the end I had to tell it what my answer was. not worth it. it wasn't even close to the category I was thinking of.  I wouldn't waste time downloading it if I had known all of this sooner.

B00BGIC4I6|1.0|This has funny parts but overall is whiny and stressful. Didn't even finish watching it. Most of the funny scenes are seen on the trailer.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Like the other reviews I have waited a long time for the third book of this trilogy to come out only to be so mad and upset by the ending.  There was NO ENDING!  What the heck.  I spent the whole day reading this stupid book waiting for this big Happy Ending and rooting for Gideon and Eva that never CAME.  I just only found out this morning that there are another two books to this whole saga.  I'm in agreement with the others that have reviewed this book in that it is a ploy for the author to make more money off of us.  I was irritated that the focus is on other characters such as Corrine and how Gideon kept going to her to help solve her issues and, what is with Brett.  I can't stand him but he keeps coming back into the picture and trying to make more problems with Eva, and; I'm also guessing she will eventually fall for before all is said and done.  Eva's main focus should be to Gideon, as he is supposedly the one that loves her and can't live without her.  Not to mention, that Eva is constantly stating though out the whole book how much she LOVES Gideon.  Now I'm guessing that the author is going to be focusing more on other characters before this story is ever wrapped up.  I'm really debating whether I'm going to be investing any more money into this farce.  Such a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT on many LEVELS.  I guess the best I can offer is read at your OWN RISK, as I can foresee that you will be as mad as me and to think you wasted $10. :(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting fun and has amazing graphics.....<br />I love playing it  I always tell myself just one more game but thats not how it usually goes for me ;)<br />This is one of my favorite games and I would reccomend this ti anyone and everyone who like ti have a fun and non depressing game to play
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this third installment.  There love story is just amazing and how there relationship just keeps getting stronger and stronger. I sooooooooooo loved all these books....Keep up the good work,,,
B009ME47H2|5.0|This is a very helpful app. Its not confusing or hard to use, but you cant change the way your voice sounds :( but its easy and free.
B003B02O7I|5.0|I say this with every Grisham book I read, but this one was a top favorite!!  I loved almost all the flawed, but striving, characters, except maybe the obvious spoiled rotten few that are sickeningly obvious.  I haven't laughed this much in a Grisham book, and pulled for the underdog at the same time, as I did with #TheTestament? You'll enjoy this read!!
1846556007|5.0|This author was recommended by a Dutch friend and the book was quite entertaining.  It started kind of slow, but finished in a gripping and creative way.

B00425S1H8|5.0|I bought one of these for use at work with some older equipment and after installing the driver that came with the device and following the installation instructions. I was up and operational. I quickly turned around and purchased a 2nd adapter to use with another piece of equipment. I have both of these adapter working on the same laptop running to devices. I had trouble at first but went to the manufacturer's website and was able to get help through the forum within about 24hrs. Very helpful and great customer support. Something you don't see very much these days.<br /><br />If you have to buy an adapter like this I more than highly recommend this one.!!!
B0071MDA2U|4.0|The story told in then and now provides a thrilling story of escape and survival. And the ending sets the stage for the finale.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Like others here, I have read many negative reviews by \\"critics\\" on many different websites. Also like other people, while everyone has a opinion I prefer to give it a listen myself before making comment.<br /><br />Yer, it's certainly not Rust in Peace but why would you expect it to be ? Just listen to Megadeth's live set on The Big Four DVD and you will see that all through their career they have experimented with various elements of hard rock/heavy metal so why some critics are surprise this is not a pure thrash album has me puzzled.<br /><br />I still enjoy this album - if you are expecting thrash metal from beginning to end then yes, you will be disappointed however to me it is still a solid hard rock album, and their are certainly some thrash elements in it.<br /><br />If you are a Megadeth fan, it is likely you will buy this album with or without any reviewers approval but personally, and as a long time Megadeth fan I do enjoy this album.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was challenging and fun. I love puzzles and this was a great one. Can't wait for th  next one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game for all ages from 4 years old to even 40. This games is one of the best mobile device games ever.
B003G4W49C|2.0|having spent so many years hearing about the book and now a movie coming out, I finally decided to read it.  I'm glad that I did in that I know the story.  However, it wasn't as enjoyable of a read as I'd expected.  The writing as a whole is bland and predictable.  There are a ton of inconsistencies that just seem like unimportant, half-formed intentions that just weren't needed but were not corrected.  The whole thing reads like a children's or YA novel.  Despite its very slow and boring first half, the last quarter of the book does pick up a little.  Whether the ending is worth it or not though is up to you.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Was kinda disappointing. Drug on forever to not even have an ending!!! At 9.99$ a book kinda stinks Sylvia Day :(
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|just need to order the real thing, instead of the free one.  Its worth it because me and the kids have a ball playing it
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft and I got pocket edition so I can play it anywhere.But I am having one problem I am stuck with 0.6.1 but it says in the description 0.7.0 and I can't update it!
B0000VCZKW|4.0|It's a good story, a comedy but with adventure and the overcoming of a bad situation by a young girl.  I imagine that girls ages 8-12 might especially enjoy it.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Love the series-ending a surprise. Did not see it coming<br />There had better be  sequel-don't want to wait a year
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I bought this, I read this and my brain died a little that day. Cliche doesn't even come close!\\"The One\\" \\"The Sword of Destiny\\"? My brain shrinks just writing about the story. The most excitement from this book was my game of guess the next part of the plot. Characters were as shallow as carpet; \\"I was scared, but brave and must fight to win the girl...\\" Things would happen that bordered on stupid and didn't follow logistic or sequential laws. I will not be reading further into the series, instead search for a more inspiring and riviting read; and in the meantime will subject my brain to something less damaging - like smoking crack!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great show.  Good actors, good plots, and lots of high minded ideas about life.  Granny is fantastic!  But I have to say after the season 3 finally Julian Fellows owes all of us something to make us feel good again.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Did not think I would like this but as usual Christoph Waltz is amazing. He is so understatedly smart, A 10.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|An interesting look at pregnancy and how it is experienced differently by different people. There are some surprisingly really sweet moments, and you care about each couple in very contrasting ways it seems. In the end, you will be pleased that everyone turns out to be amazingly human and lovable.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie is one of the best films I have seen in years. It covers a full range of emotions in a wonderfully entertaining movie. I give it a thumbs up.,
193700788X|3.0|I am a huge fan of Charlaine Harris.  I have read all her series and consider her Sookie Stackhouse novels her crowning glory!  I bring the Sookie books out twice a year and read them all over again.  I never get tired of them and derive so much pleasure from them.  I also watch Trueblood on HBO every season, even though it is nothing like the books.  I was in shock when I read that Dead Ever After is the last of the Sookie novels.  I know that 14 years is a long time to be writing about the same character and that Charlaine wants to move on to bigger and better things.  But I can't help feeling that she didn't give Sookie the proper send off.  It feels like her heart was not in it while she was writing it and had already said her goodbyes to Sookie and just wanted to get rid of the character in the easiest way possible. Sam for Sookie?  How lame is that?  After Eric, she should be with Alcide or Quinn or even a Fairy would have been great.  Why can't she be pregnant with Eric's child?  After all, didn't her grandfather bless her and her land?  She is part fairy after all and it is definitely possible. This is the one book of Sookie Stackhouse I only read once.  I am a very disappointed fan.  Sookie deserved better.<br /><br />Millicent Graham
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Very disappointed....everything from the first two,books was still left unanswered....and then it still didn't end. Was so excited because the first two books were great but this one left the series down....
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Can't wait for the next book!! Totally bummed I've finished reading already & of course it ends with u wanting more!
B00847KFDS|4.0|As a long time John Fogerty fan there are some of my favorite songs included, from his days a leader of CCR and his solo material over all I thought this album was done with respect for his material.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|this was an awesome book, but it ended too abruptly. which I feel was done deliberately in order to produce a fourth book. I just hope it is not another six months before the next book comes out
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Ever since I was a kid I've loved listening to The Beach Boys. After reading reviews of others who had bought the live 50th Anniversary Album , I decided not to buy it unless they came out with one that basically had ALL the songs that were on the set list. I was not disappointed in this album. As a long time Beach Boy fan it was great to hear those songs by pretty much the original Beach Boys (of course Carl and Dennis were missing) there is a nice tribute to both of them.<br /><br />All I can say is 50 years and the Beach Boys still sound good.

B008SOS63S|5.0|Love every track.  Joe B is this generation's Stevie Ray Vaughn and he has more variation in licks and electronic wizardry.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Great graphics, and animation. Once you get into the game, they make it to where you can't get anywhere unless you buy pearls.
0452289963|1.0|Couldn't agree more with all the one star reviews.  Maybe you need this watered down low-intellect stuff but recommend reading Thich Nhat Hanh for the real thing.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|First off we got lied to about the release date by many months! Then we were told it was a trilogy now it's to be 5 book series! I agree with a lot of the other reviews the story is all over the place. Eva is a tramp not worthy of Gideon and Cary doesn't seem to see how his life has turned around for the better. Cary and Eva deserve each other! I will never waste another penny of my hard earned money on another Sylvia Day book!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Pros: -No solar panel, so you do not need to be under a light<br />-Easy to use<br />-Simple<br />-Useful<br /><br />Cons: None that I can think of.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|It does not work and tried to get me to go the the developers website. I seems suspiciously like a virus.
159448385X|5.0|Another excellent book by this author.  This book was a depiction of a city under the ravages of war and how two families survived with death and destruction around them.  The brutal attacks of a husband were unbelievable but probably endured in a country where women were treated like dirt.  I liked the characters of the two young girls who grew up to be women.  This was a very readable book and I liked it very much.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Who didn't like this movie growing up? My children often wonder what types of movies we grew up with so I purchased a fe and this being one of them. Cute and Funny.

B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|It's an amazing game and amazing graphics with smooth controls the only down side is that there is no offline part to the game it's all online but it's an amazing game.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|The idea was excellent, but the actual game play is awful. There is just nothing to the game. It does not deliver on the promise.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I love these characters and wanted to see a glimpse to where they were going.  I loved the important event between Eva and Gideon!  However, so much was not resolved and is going to written in another book.  I feel the author was not as loyal to her fans as she should have been.  This was advertised as a trilogy and should have been written this way.  The way it stands now another book is a must for those of us that want an satisfying ending!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Lovely looking game, very simple concept but hair-ripping on some levels, just what I needed to waste loads of time...
B008D30K7E|1.0|I just could not enjoy this book, I didn't like Allan or any of the other characters, I could not picture them, I waded through mud to reach my goal of 33% before giving up and was relieved when I got there. Having said that half of my bookclubbers loved it and gave it 5 stars. I feel as though I was missing the point or I must have no sense of humour.
1401235425|5.0|I was hesitant about the New 52 event, but this book was fantastic. I tried to save parts of it and pace myself, but read it in one sitting. The Court of Owls are a different, intriguing, risky set of villains, but Snyder pulls them off wonderfully. I cannot wait to read part 2 since part 1 was of such high quality, both in the story and in the artwork.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The story delivers but there are too many hanging concepts  and undeveloped plots makes for an underdeveloped  story without follow thru or closure
1781162646|5.0|Fantastic summer read!  Mr. King at his best.  Great characters and plot.  A fun summer read.  If you like fine fiction, I promise that you will not be disappointed.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have both iPhone and kindle versions of this game and I enjoy playing it. While the kindle version is not as up to date as the iPhone version it's still a great game!  Very cute graphics!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was a gift and my boys were thrilled.  They read book  and then watched a movie and so on.
B000TEPJOY|5.0|Outstanding players playing outstandingly on outstanding compositions.  I am not always that taken with Miles Davis, but here he is the bomb.  If you like the music of this era, you must have it!
B008K9SG9K|3.0|a few good songs, but don't expect any of the non radio ones to be very good, waste of money
B009NY43NY|3.0|I can only say sometimes as readers we wish for a different out come for the characters we invest in. I love CH....and I will continue to read her books. However, Sookie deserved a better outcome.
B007DIQC90|3.0|a few good songs, but don't expect any of the non radio ones to be very good, waste of money
B000HEWEE4|3.0|this is quite a stretch for  one's imagination.. good story and favorite actor and actress.. the dog adds a welcome touch as well.. but the story is almost too complicated and incredible to watch...
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I love Gideon and Eva, but the fact that we have to wait for yet another book in this so called \\"trilogy\\" is frustrating. I was a little peeved at how Eva acted with Brett. If Gideon is her world why is she even giving Brett the time of day, especially after what happened. There were so many things left hanging it just felt like the story was being dragged out with no real ending anywhere.
B008CRC506|5.0|good tv.. but better as DVD... a change from usual weekly TV action and shoot 'em ups.. more complex story and characters.. setting was great fun... music also a welcome change.. season two also a good bet for watching...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Everybody should read Hopeless, it's just amazing! I had no idea I was going to be reading about high school kids, but Sky and Holder were just so mature and handled the very scary and intense issues so well, I was surprised. It is very romantic, but the sex scenes are not graphic. Colleen Hoover is a master story-teller and this book is one of the best of the year! You won't be sorry and you'll think about it for days!
B003NTSBUG|4.0|Leonardo really works this part and makes it come alive. You seriously will be guessing throughout the movie and even the end will leave you thinking. A wonderful evening movie.
B0034G4P94|5.0|loved the movie from start to finish total entertainment  and the fight scenes were excellent<br />excellent plot and great action
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This is an absolutely fun movie that has some twists and turns to keep you interested. The action is great and the acting is superb.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|top item first time i viewed tom cruise as an adult actor top entertainment, very exciting plot keep the viewer interested throughout the entire  movie
034553154X|1.0|It did not meet expectations. The drawings are vague and very poorly done. I would return it if it wasn't a pain to do so.
0691152640|2.0|So Stephen Colbert and Thomas Herndon  indicate that 2 countries and one continent were left out of the data. The that makes this a flawed and biased report.<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-AUKNZL0bM
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|By far the best looking Predator to date. The visuals are amazing and I believe that Robert Rodriguez, the driving force behind this release, does not hold back on this stellar production. A worthy item to add to anyone's blu-ray collection.
B00BMBA2CC|5.0|This is a very danceable c.d. It takes me back to the NuWave days of the 80's. How did I get this very danceable gem. It; has me clapping my hands,doing dances. Singing. Wow, the 80's must be coming back. It's not on the charts in America. Well, this is my own personal  c.d. charts. This is type of music, my 8-year old daughter; likes to dance, to. CHARLIXCX; haven't heard of her till Amazon. It was in recommended. I can tell that; Prince and Andre' Cymore; have a lot to do with this artist. It's has that sound and production. She must of studied; Prince and Andre Cymore. Even the vocals; are like WOW. Them; drum machines,keys,bass,percussion,handclaps. Like I'm back in the 80's dance club. I'm a fan for life. Are there any remixes and mixtapes of CHARLIXCX. Amazon; should get them. I want them in my collections. And I do mean collections. Get this c.d., I want to move to London, if the music is like this. Can't stop dancing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|The most entertaining, time consuming game you'll ever love. The graphic are a solid improvement from the first Angry Birds. And being that this is the Rio version its even better for kids than the first Angry birds.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i think this is a great game for senior citizens.  The speed and dexterity are great for honing out brains.
B005ZUR724|4.0|It's actually really addicting. The camera can be frustrating at times, but that's it. Definitely worth the money. The graphics are decent
193700788X|5.0|I loved these book, but am disappointed this is the last Sookie Stackhouse novel.  Charlaine Harris is an awesome writer.
B00CFQMVLS|1.0|Pretty  much what the critics have already said.  The sets are neat, the action is good (though a lot of it is vehicles & helicopters shooting at things, not nearly as much on a smaller / more intimate scale).<br /><br />But the dialog is awful.  The lines feel like B-movie stuff.  The subplot of McClane & his son is predictable, but completely bad.<br /><br />The one liners are campy as well.  It feels like a lot of them were improvised and unnecessary.  You could probably make a drinking game out of it.<br /><br />I loved all the other movies, some more than others.  But this one was dishearteningly bad.  They're making another; that's actually kind depressing now.
B00821OX98|5.0|I had seen this advertised before it started and wanted to watch it but have so many other things set on the DVR that I didn't have room. So glad that Amazon was offering it to Prime members for FREE! Great Quality video also!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This author does something I can't. Write. I loved the first two books. But the 3rd is disappointing. No need to get into detail. The other reviews say it all. Dragging it out. We were so to speak lead to believe this would be the end and its not. Don't think ill purchase the other two when they are available. Ill just read the reviews and save my money since this 10.00 was seriously overpriced. She should be ashamed. Done.
B008476HBM|1.0|I HATE IT!!!!!!!! I just skipped to the 100% to write a review. It was sooooooo boring !!!!!!! Not interesting at all. I have been at 6% since JANUARY AND IT IS NOW JUNE. You should never read this EVER. You can die if you do. It does not deserve a half star.
0865478007|5.0|Thank you for taking the time to reveal the inefficiencies of the drug companies. You are a talented and thoughtful writer! This book should be read by anyone interested in learing, period!
B00CVCIZI4|5.0|I've been listening to Leprous since Tall Poppy Syndrome came into the radio station I worked at. With each album they've put out, they've changed their style enough that it feels completely unlike the previous albums. And this album feels very different from its predecessors. I have a hard time describing other bands that sound like these guys, but I'll say in some ways, it makes me think of the Opeth album Damnation. This album seems a little bit slower, and maybe not quite as heavy as the previous two, but it is still fantastic.
0865479186|5.0|Actually read this book after Bad Pharma. Once again, learned many things expressed throughout the book. Of the hundreds of books I have had the privelege to read, BEN IS IN MY TOP 5. What an amazing talent!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Hated the fact that I had to wait an extra couple months for the ebook, but otherwise it was a pretty good closure.  There were a number of things that were &#34;quickly resolved&#34; that warranted better story as well as some plot elements that randomly showed up seemingly without a good lead-in (like Fain).  Overall it was still worth my money!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|So absolutely disappointed!!! I adored the first two books and was so looking forward to this one. Bummed when the release date got pushed back but still was super excited. I feel Sylvia is drawing it out for the money but you know what you won't get mine!! I'm done! There's no need to keep the story going when it could of easily been finished up with this book.<br /><br />I love Eva and was so excited to see her get her happy ending...ummm ya that didn't happen. And throwing Brett in the mix when you know Eva is in love with Gideon was just a space filler to me. Wasting any time on  Megumi in this story was just pointless to me. Please tell me why I should care about her?!?! The suspense of knowing what's going on with her is not gonna kill me. Carey was one of my favorite characters in the first two books but in Entertwined with You he really just bugs!! Sylvia why are you all of the sudden making him so unlikable?<br /><br />I'm done with this series, seriously want my money and the time I wasted on this pointless book back!  Not sure that I'll continue to read any of Sylvia's book because I'm so disappointed and don't want to get caught up in another waste of time series.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Superb performance!! Highly recommended !!!, fast proccesor...stable, currently running FreeBSD 9.1 x86 64 bits as home server, no issues, simply awesome cpu!
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I loved this book!  It was fast paced and kept my attention.  In fact it was difficult putting it down!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The constant delays in releasing this final installment were irritating. To end the third book with a &#34;To Be Continued...&#34;like a bad 1980s melodrama was inexcusable.<br /><br />Ms. Day has lost a loyal reader not only for the Crossfire series but for any other future offerings. Fool me once, shame on you.  I'm smart enough not to be fooled twice.<br /><br />I hope your trips to the bank are worth it.
B00BN3ECTS|3.0|Nicolas Sparks is the master of pulling at your heartstrings and giving you ooey gooey reach for the tissue moments and he delivers again here. This an okay movie, interesting ride but pretty much what you expect from Sparks. Pacing hurt this movie some too. There were moments- like when they were building the connections between the characters that felt rushed and other moments that seemed to drag. No real surprises, the mystery was pretty predictable- even my husband unraveled and called the ending right down to \\"the twist\\" but if you like Sparks and having your emotions toyed with- you'll like this movie. I have to be in the mood for a Sparks book or film. Tonight I was and got what I expected.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|Wow, a cover of one of my favorite thin lizzy songs, co-written by one of my favorite guitarists, John Sykes. Gotta get this now!
B00C81AVNU|5.0|... book a trip to The Great White Way to see the musical live. Harvey Fierstein, Cyndi Lauper, and Jerry Mitchell knocked the ball out of the park. They deserve the 13 Tony Nominations they garnered for it!
B0064UPU4G|4.0|Overall, this is a really good album. Knew some of their songs but did not know the album had such great material.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This game is amazing! I managed to stump it a couple of times, but it guessed &quot;The Scream&quot; painting by Evard Munch! Played it more than thirty times with no problems. No spyware, no lag, no making my device crash. This is a spontaneous review from an unpaid consumer, and I think this game is a brilliant example of the use of flow-charts and algorhythms.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I bought this album after purchasing the &#34;Get Lucky&#34; single. I was instantly hooked and after going through their catalog, I was made into a fan. Once this album became available I had to get it! At first, I wasn't really digging it that much because I was comparing it to what I had been listening from their other albums but once I decided to give it a chance and really listen to it with a clear mind, I started to appreciate the album for the great material. Has a new '70's and '80's sound that seems to be new. It truly is a really good album.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is one of the best books of this series.  The book maintained the perfect balance between the love story and the rest of the plot.  It kept me on the edge of my seat from the moment I started reading.  I am planning to read this book many times.
0316044695|4.0|I ordered this book for my grown son and he loves it. He informed me that he really enjoyed reading it.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|The suits that they have are cool. You have lots of them. It's a awesome game that  iron man fan would want to play. There is action that happens throughout you ' 're run . It is like temple run .
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I've never been a big SNL fan, mostly because it's past my bedtime, but when Bossypants was offered for 99 cent for the Kindle, I couldn't pass it up.<br /><br />This book is hilarious! It's a perfect blend of funny shorts, one-liners, background info on Tina, how she got started, feminism, and the inside scoop on SNL. I'm also from Philadelphia, a working mother, and the same age as the author so I may have identified more than some readers.<br /><br />I hated to see the book end. I hope she writes more and I'll definitely be watching 30 Rock after reading this.
B00992CF6W|1.0|My iPhone updated the game but my kindle hasent y is that hu hu Amazon or managing y Is that plz update it in at least then 18 he plz .
B0098460O4|5.0|This duo is superb.  Love the CD and play it over and over.<br />I look forward to their next one.
1476734941|5.0|Saw Michael Mosley's PBS program and bought the book.  My wife and I have been on the Fastdiet program for over a month and have seen some impressive results.  My body fat has dropped over 1% (I am fairly active and don't need to lose weight) and my wife has lost 3 lbs.  More impressive is that my wife likes the program.  I am looking forward to my next doctor visit to see if my cholesterol has changed.
B00012QM8G|5.0|It's a longer movie than I'm used to...but very interesting and I learned a little more about history of WWII...and a true story! I've watched it twice.
6305546789|5.0|This is a really good and classic horror movie, my son's favorite horror movie. And I also thought that Michael Myers did a really good job in it, and also, Jon Carpenter really knows how to make classics like Halloween.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors.  This book was very exciting and kept up my interest.  If you like mystery, this will suit you very well.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I saw the trailer and it clicked with something inside me.<br /><br />I didn't bother reading any reviews ahead of time and dove right into the movie. I loved it!<br /><br />Logan Lerman is great. By the end it started to remind me of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's early movie choices (i.e. Brick & The Lookout) and how I loved this quiet, quirky character.<br /><br />Emma Watson, didn't have a lot of \\"acting\\" opportunity in this movie (not her fault) and it could have nearly been any young woman actress in the role, but I felt her charisma kept me believing and liking her in the movie.<br /><br />Not being that familiar with Ezra Miller, I looked him up on IMDB and one of his first movie credits is playing a character listed as \\"Big Bully\\". Interesting to see how he is on the other side of things in more ways than one in this movie. Since his character is loud and then has these subtle sorrowful moments, he really shined in the movie and was a good opposite side of the spectrum from Logan's character of Charlie.<br /><br />The story is basically one school year's worth of story then part of the following year. The time transition clues in the movie were in most cases subtle, but well shot and directed.<br /><br />The music and the emotion & mood were perfectly directed in this movie.<br /><br />As an aspiring writer who normally reads/writes fantasy & sci-fi I would normally not read this kind of story. After seeing the movie I'm going out to get the book, it was that enjoyable and allowed me to relate on many levels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game cause you get to challenge yourself to beat your own score and try to get yourself better everytime you play.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Great fun for the younger grandchild, he can enjoy it while the older one plays<br />a different game.  Realistic and a great learning tool.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Pretty good read the other books and please buy survival craft it is so much fun download from the community
B005LAIISA|4.0|This was a gift and they really like the movie it was very funny and I had a great time watching it to. It was as funny as all the other ones. Very funny movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game, and i love it even more on here. Bingo Blitz is such an adicting game. thank you for an amazing game
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the trilogy! Easy read! The book lets you imagine life in a different way! Some on....join the fantasy - you'll like it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Alright I have this game on my iPhone and today there was a update for version 7.0 and I was wondering how we get it on here??
B005HED11Y|5.0|But quite honestly - good. Some of the new images really enhance this wonderful classic. The only drawback is that you can see where Spock's makeup wasn't applied evenly. I guess it's ok, he's only half Vulcan.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This thing really wakes you up! I tried choosing the most annoying ringtone and 2 hard questions to wake up my brain! Yeah it even woke up my mom!!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I hate to admit it, but I have to agree with everyone on here. There were supposed to be 3 books total. So we all bought the last and final book (so we thought) to finally see how Eva and Gideon's story ends... It doesn't... 5 books serioulsy?? What more can a couple go through.  I kept reading the book thinking. \\"The next page something has to happen\\" and yet, it never did. I felt the book was long and drawn out and nothing happend. I spent $10 for... nothing. I think that the author and the publisher should have been up front with the public BEFORE this book was released. I was so let down when I got to the last page and it said the story isn't over... HUH? What else can you write about? I really lost interest in the characters and the book. The publishers should have scrapped this book and made her write the 3rd and LAST book!<br />I do feel that its all for greed is why there is going to be 5 books now?? I don't think I care to know how Eva and Gideon's story end if I have to read about everyone else's issues and problems.  SO not worth the wait. Thanks for nothing I guess?? Farewell Eva and Gideon I don't care to know you any longer.
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|Excellent acing by all performers, especially by Juliane Hough.  Good directing. The overall production quality of the film is very good.
0767802624|5.0|All these years later and still a funny movie.  One of my favorites movies.  I recommend it to everyone who likes comedies.
B00AJLHULW|5.0|great production value.  The musicianship is simply astounding!  First time purchasing Robben Ford. Heard 'Birdsnest' on Sirius' BBKings Bluesville.  Simply awesome
B00280LYIC|4.0|My granddaughter downloaded this book for me  because she likes this series.  Good choice!  Will read more of them soon.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Far from the best in the series, but overall a satisfying finale. It ties up all the loose ends a casual fan could ask for. I definitely do not want to damn with faint praise; it was overall a satisfying read, and it could have been SO much worse. Recommended for Sookie fans.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Touching, fun, heartwarming story. Loved the movie. I rent movies from Amazon on a fairly frequent basis and I'm usually always pleased.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I purchased Angry Birds Space for Android a year ago and it has run fine on several devices. I just purchased a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" and find that I have to pay $2.99 for a \\"Kindle Tablet Edition\\"--no reason given. Same for Angry Birds Star Wars, Airport Mania, and I don't know how many other apps. Someone has decided to extract additional money from me and any other purchasers of Kindle Fire HD, and I don't know if it's Amazon or Rovio. I do know that I feel like I've been had.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the book and I can't wait for the next one...I just hope it doesn't take to long to come out..
142314189X|4.0|I enjoyed this book series; I listened to the audio CD, and while the narrator has a voice that I find semi-annoying (and my sisters can't stand), he does an excellent job with his dramatization of the characters.<br /><br />The story is entertaining and good for say 10+ year old children. I think it is clever and, having never had much knowledge of Greek mythology, I found this an interesting introduction to basic Greek mythology.<br /><br />While children will definitely enjoy these books and some college students with an interest in juvenile fiction will enjoy it; adults will (most likely) not find this story as entertaining as the younger children. However, if parents are looking for a story that they can listen to (or read together) with their children, this would be one of them.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|We put the picture's name on everything!<br /><br />What's left to say - if you haven't seen it...buy it now.  Still waiting for Spaceballs 2 - The Search for More Money...
1781162646|5.0|I loved \\"Joyland.\\" I loved that it is out in paperback, with a super cover painting by Glen Orbik, looking like the pulp fiction I grew up reading.<br /><br />This coming-of-age story about Devin Jones is one of King's best. He always seems to do better when the number of words allowed to tell the story is kept to a minimum. He is one of the best short-story writers out there and \\"Joyland\\" (at under 300 pages) is not much longer than a novella.  Concise, precise wording telling Devin's story with a minimum of fuss and bother - just lyrical prose that took me back to 1973 and a slower, albeit not necessarily, safer time.<br /><br />Intricate, well-drawn characters fill this book with life. The plot line, with its carny folk, ghostly presences, and murder mystery starts out well, gathers steam, and ends perfectly.<br /><br />If I had to compare it (in my mind and opinion) to other King favorites of mine, the others would be the short story \\"The Body\\"; [[ASIN:0671042858 The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon]]; and [[ASIN:0307743659 The Shining]]. To me, the best of all three of these examples of King's fiction are in \\"Joyland.\\"<br /><br />Excuse me - I'm going to go read it again. I want to savor the book more this time around rather than rushing through it.
B00ADLCC9I|1.0|Man this thing is a peace,flimsy construction,but actually performs ok,however I bought this to game on that's why this thing is special for starters the buttons are to high and hard to reach 2nd the joysticks are TRASH their unresponsive and rough (like their full of sand) I was lucky enough to be standing next to a brick wall and a trash can so I took advantage of the situation and rid the world of suffering with this wretched pos...I mean think about it archos sounds a lot like atrocity to me and it is...what a shame,well off with u now and never ever think of buying this unbelievable waste of money... Good day
B009FZHYKU|3.0|That is what my husband says about this.  The drama seems to be self-inflicted and people have no reason for much of what they do.
B0087GYY92|2.0|Good author, clever idea and it didn't work for me.<br />It takes the joke about red shirted security guards in sci-if always getting killed in episodes and introduces us to a starship where reality and fiction blends rather too much. The first half of the book is the story of The Intrepid where crews members die too easily and eventually realise it may be the script that is to blame. The second half is a number of codas giving us different perspectives on the story and for me I had lost interest by then to be honest.<br />The trouble is, much of this has been done before, and better. So this adds very little and is not as clever as it thinks it is. Shame as Scalzi is a good writer but he is off target with this one.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Sure the singing is nice, but Hugh is no Colm Wilkinson.  I did see some things in here that weren't clear in the stage or previous movie.  But, for a good movie get the previous edition starring Liam Neeson.  There is passion in that that seems to be missing in this musical one.  Here, I just wanted the singing to be done and to get to the next scene.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|You'll not want to put it down. The pages seem to turn themselves. Once you start clear your schedule. Many surprises await you.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Nothing spectacular about this movie except the upside-down plain.  Yes, I do like that there is a character change in the end, though it is slight and comes out fo the blue.
0563214546|2.0|Whilst there is some excellent advice in this book, I was disappointed with few recipes provided.  I expected more and it just didn't flow well.  Wish I didn't buy it now.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|A perfect addition to the Quell series. New tasks add  interest. Love the illumination feature. Still figuring out some items such as Jailbreak.  Interesting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its has a strong variety of fun logic games. My favorite is Tornado Hockey. Also the games that you complete you receive bonus coins so that you may buy other gamea! !!!!!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I have always felt that another movie, at the least, was in store for fans of the books Thomas Harris wrote around the character Hannibal Lector. In Hannibal Rising, we learned of his beginnings. The book and movie end with his being in training to become a doctor. In Red Dragon, we get to see the end part of Hannibal's collaboration with FBI agent Will. I hoped that another book between those two books/movies would explore that time when Hannibal was a practicing psychiatrist.<br />I love that this is the time frame chosen to explore Hannibal by way of a tv series! I will be sad the day/year/episode the series has to end because the next book/movie-The Silence of the Lambs picks up where that part of Hannibal's life as a psychiatrist ends.<br />The actors in this series are all above board, believable, but I wish that Jack Crawford's part had been better chosen. Lawrence Fishburn is an awesome actor; but just like I cannot see anyone else but Jodie Foster as Agent Clarice Staring, I cannot see anyone else as Jack. I like the actor who plays Hannibal in his time of being a practicing physician. He is younger, so the physical differences are accepted for me. I wish they could have gotten the same actor who played Jack Crawford in Silence of the Lambs.<br />I hope to continue to be a fan of Hannibal-I have left out so many other aspects of the show that I love. I cannot wait to see more!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|A gripping story, one that will keep you hooked on every word.  The characters are so compelling that you want them to succeed in whatever they have to do to keep themselves and others as safe. They fight against people who would destroy others just because they are different. They don't want anyone who is a different race  think they are better the superior beings.  This is a great story, uplifting even that the characters overcome a horrific past to make a life together. ENJOY
B00CW665VI|5.0|Love this book and it was so much fun having it told from the male POV. Drew is awesome and I love that he stops the story to talk directly to you GENIUS....... What a great love story and its nice to see the man have to bust his a** to get the lady for a change.<br />Be prepared to have people stare at you if your reading this in a public place because you will bust out laughing, especially when a 4 year old starts talking at a dinner table, I couldn't get my laughing under control I lost it. Fun Fun Story.&#34;
B0000AFQS0|5.0|While reading Pete Townshend's bio, he referenced this movie.  I don't know why I never saw it as I am a big fan.  It is incredible and I highly recommend it.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|For the average person way to confusing! As for time and place moving from past, present and future! One thing consistent - The birth mark!!!
B00BR9XBIG|5.0|No delusion's here. Richard is the premiere source for the knowledge, our past present,and potential future. I read him knowing that I only have to check his facts once! LOL!!!!
B002QE3CTY|3.0|I read through the Maze Runner trilogy and was always hoping for it to get better. The setting was well described and unique, but the characters could have been better developed. For example, the main character Thomas, was (no spoiler) the so called \\"chosen one\\". However, in each book there was nothing very strongly unique about him. Neither him, the author, or the other characters made him say a genius, or reckless, or powerful, etc. He, at the most, was grudgingly adaptive.  If Thomas and other main characters were better expressed, the plot and driving force behind the character's doings would have benefited as well.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I can't get the new update ps if I knew how to it would be different story. Tell me if you know
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Everybody dies. Seriously. Omg. I'm going to run to the bank now and put money in my bank account so I can read the next one...
0062059963|4.0|In a land with a caste system that keeps people stationary and desperate to survive, what better way to calm tensions than have a Selection: a contest for girls of all castes to compete for their chance to win the heart of the Prince. In Kiera Cass's sequel The Elite, the competition has gotten stiffer and the world has gotten more dangerous.<br /><br />America isn't sure what to do anymore. She was finally admitting her feelings for Maxon before Aspen arrived at the palace as one of the guards. Seeing Aspen changed everything. All those feelings she had thought she left behind came rushing forward and she struggled with the conflicting feelings building up inside her. Meanwhile, the competition was down to only a handful of girls, and with America liked some of them, there were others she downright despised, like Celeste. Celeste knew how to push American's buttons, but more importantly, she wanted America to remember her place in the world: as a Five. As the lowest caste girl left in the competition, she wasn't the country's popular choice, but she seemed to be Maxon's.<br /><br />Then something happened. When one of America's dearest friends among the selection is caught with a guard, punished severely, and banished to live life as an Eight, the lowest caste, America can't imagine how Maxon could stand by and allow a young girl to be treated like that. She begins to see the true nature of the monarchy and everything it entails. Where America once thought she could change the country from the top, now she has begun to realize there might not be any chance to change anything. The people with control might have such a dangerous and all-powerful grip on the country that a girl like America doesn't have a chance. Especially as rebels from their own country continue to break into the palace in an effort to destroy the Selection and wars across oceans threaten their very existence.<br /><br />One thing I wanted more of in The Selection was world-building. I can't say I got as much as I wanted from this sequel, but I definitely got some more background than the little amount in the first book gave me. We learned a lot about the creation of the new monarchy from generations ago and how the caste system was created, but we still don't know much about the different kinds of rebels and what they were up to. Since this books is a dystopia, it seems strange we would be able to get through two whole books without real answers about the world the story is set in. Still, I focused more on the relationships between the girls, America and Maxon, America and Aspen, and the rest of the cast. And that kept me happy throughout the book.<br /><br />And usually I despise love triangles, but this one doesn't bother me, mostly because I still really, really like Maxon and don't have much interest in Aspen. You see a lot more of Aspen in this story, and you are supposed to question Maxon's position and choices in a few places, but I still really liked Maxon. Only once did I want to slap him around a little bit, but if you consider all the mixed signals America sent him and her lack of real interest in the competition, I am not sure you can completely blame the guy for trying to find a back-up plan to the princess problem. I think if things were different and he just pined after American with all her indecisiveness and wavering nonsense, he would be completely unrealistic! In fact, had I been Maxon, I would have given up on her LONG before he actually started to.<br /><br />I started reading this story during the busiest time of our school year, the bitter end. It meant I fought to find time to read, and the book took me an unusual 7-8 days to finish. Usually this destroys a book for me, but The Elite still held my attention even with the gaps in my chances to read it. I think that is a sign of a pretty good story, and I am really looking forward to the next one. I just hope we get the full story behind the world they live in because it has the potential to be incredibly interesting!al to be incredibly interesting!
B008JJM88Q|4.0|It is a fun game! My entire family enjoyed trying to stump it. I gave it 4 stars, not 5 (my original impression playing it by myself), because when I was trying to impress my family with it, the pictures didn't show up with the answers. More importantly, Akinator wasn't very smart asking the same questions we had already answered. It took many more guesses for him to come up with an answer. I had done a couple customizations and they didn't show up properly as well. I wanted to show off to my daughter and husband that Akinator would guess their names with their pictures. However, each time I played by myself (before and after trying to impress), no problems. Annoying to say the least.<br /><br />As far as the multiple claims it's dangerous to install... I've scanned my entire device with 2 different anti-virus programs and they both show this app is safe and my system is secure. Not true with all FAOTDs. One recent app (Fruit ninja) had trojans in it. Sadly, I uninstalled that.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The book itself was good but not what I was expecting<br />I wanted more but glad to hear there will two more to this series because we can no longer call it a trilogy
B00992CF6W|4.0|on my ipod minecraft got an update with buckets milk cake spawn eggs a lots of other cool things but there isn't an update for kindle version but overall good game
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Download and play you just can't stop playing. Fun for the whole family doesn't matter if you're old or young keeps getting more challenging.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finished this book two days after buying it! The excitement and suspense swallowed me up! Surprise ending: Peeta and Katniss  win the games together! Collins sure knows how to write an exciting story. Thrilling and creative. Only comment: Why did Rue have to die so early? She should have lived longer.<br /> Anyways, the hunger games captivated me. Can't wait to read catching fire!
B002ZG9968|5.0|Thought this was a cute story line and it had some really funny moments in it.  Like both main actors in this movie so it was a 'win-win'.
B001F4UHFI|5.0|Nicholas Cage did a great job on this movie. Goos suspense and drama. Watch it and you will not regret it
0451232852|5.0|This is another great book written by Ken Follett. Goes through several generation of families  in both England and Europe.
0425263924|1.0|I was ready to order the 3rd book in the Crossfire \\"trilogy,\\" but decided to do something I don't ordinarily do -- read the reviews. I have been very surprised and disappointed to read that the vast majority of readers are extremely disappointed that this book was NOT the last in the trilogy and that Gideon and Eva's story has been watered down with sub-plots now thrown in. As a result, I have decided that I want to read the book (disappointed though I will probably be) BUT I will not pay $9.99 for a book that has disappointed so many loyal fans. Shame on Sylvia Day for bowing to the almighty dollar.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|My 6 yr old loves this game! I wouldn't have a clue what to do but my son just picked it up and started to have fun! He say's it's &#34;sooooo cool!&#34;

B000002JSH|4.0|Who couldn't like Bad Company and Paul Rodges? This brings back a lot of good memories and the vocals, writing and music are above the rest.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing book, heavy on the heart, but it's so worth it. I recommend it to anyone and everyone. Great job.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|This is the reason I read. For books like this. Though Eleanor & Park didn't leave me with any particularly pertinent life lessons, it was plain and simple, a truly adorable account of first love. And after having just finished a series of somewhat blah reads, this is exactly the kind of book I was hoping for.<br /><br />Rowell expertly captures the voice and sentiment that permeates high school life. From the so-called cool kids to the outcasts, you really get a feel of what life was like at Eleanor and Park's school. Everybody has their strengths, and everybody sure as hell has their insecurities. And above all, I loved how the relationship between Eleanor & Park progresses. The stages described in the development from complete strangers (with a twinge of animosity) to toleration to friendship and then beyond are all absurdly true to life.<br /><br />Because Rowell wrote her characters with such accuracy, the book evoked a really strong sense of nostalgia. Again, it wasn't anything too deep, but definitely an enjoyable read.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I really really really like this app because i am able to understand it.  The way it shows the weather is great.
B00BUT5IAC|5.0|(Second paragraph will discuss the physical vinyl)<br />I pre-ordered the vinyl version of this a couple weeks before it came out, I did not get it until today, 8 days later, I have been waiting to listen to this album until I got the vinyl, trying to hold myself over by repeating \\"Stone\\" many many times. I cannot say enough good things about the new tracks, I am a huge fan of AiC with Layne Staley and will always miss that, but I have beautiful music they made together that I will enjoy for the rest of my life, I am just happy AiC is still going and continuing to produce great music, doing something different, while keeping their signature sound. I admit they DO sound way different but when I first heard the single on the radio I immediately knew it was them, that \\"something special\\" is still there. If you are an AiC fan I recommend getting this album, if you are a new fan and like the single \\"Stone\\" I recommend it completely, you wont be disappointed.<br /><br />I wanted to review the vinyl separately because it's hard to sift through all the reviews to find the quality of the product, especially when you are spending a pretty penny on it you may not want to blind buy like I did. Let me start off by saying, the vinyls are beautiful the picture discs just look great! Its a double LP, vinyl has a good weight to it and feels like great quality. From the pictures on AiC website I assumed it came in a clear plastic cover that had some structure to it, however, (the only major disappointment of the whole purchase)the sleeve IS actually clear plastic, heavy weight plastic, but flimsy, I have never bought a picture disc before but I am assuming it's the same stuff they are usually packed in, but with so many negative reviews on that packaging I figured record companies would try something a little different. There is no support in the sleeve whatsoever it comes with a flimsy piece of paper with the songs written on the back of it, i might cut a piece of cardboard to slidebehind the paper just to support it for now, until I can get my hands on picture disc sleeves of some sort. Okay, so enough about the disappointing packaging, I am no audiophile as long as something is not crazy out of wack it does not bother me. There is some surface noise, which I have heard is common with picture discs, the only time i hear it is right after the needle drop, and as soon as the last song is done, otherwise I don't hear it at all. The music sounded great to me, heavy, clear, and like it should. I cannot compare the sound to the mp3 or cd version as I haven;t listened to either yet, but I can say that I happy with the purchase, and I'm happy to add this to my AiC collection, a MUST buy for and AiC fan, treat yourself :)
B007BFSYMS|3.0|I don't even use it. It does what it states but for me is kind of useless. I was just giving it a test drive. If you want something like this, then this product would be good for you.
055358894X|4.0|Superb story about a gang of grifters in a fantasy setting. The characters, storyline and pacing is good. Keep the stories coming...
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|Bukowski and his words represent lower class poverty stricken winos and hookers. He writes the truth and his writing is an easy read. Plain words from the world that he knew. And despite it all, he finds beauty in his world an conveys it to his readers without the need to use big English words and deep metaphors. Who needs all that when someone like Buk could just tell a story. Damn good stories most people can relate to. Yet we are taught to study Shakespeare, Robert Lewis Stevenson...crap that bores and is simply unreadable:)
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Can't wait for Season Five to  come out on Amazon Prime, love the Sci Fi shows wish they had more
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter says this is brilliant, she loves playing it. She nags (pun intended!) me to play it all the time, she likes feeding<br /> her horse and giving her treats.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have this on my phone, my Kindle, and my desktop. I can take notes from just about anywhere and save them to the same file. It's awesome. You're supposed to use this as a bulletin board and save all kinds of media to it, but I use it for text only: lists and notes and reminders and nothing else.<br /><br />What kind of jeans does my girlfriend wear- are they the ones here that are on sale? Lemme check Evernote. My doctor said to record my headaches? I'll use Evernote to record them and to tell him in his office. What was the name of that band I heard on the radio? Oh, I saved it to Evernote.<br /><br />It has replaced that little spiral notebook I had but could never find.
1439102813|5.0|My grandfather was diagnosed with dementia a couple of years ago but just recently moved to the same town as me.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I just finished Entwined last night!  Yes, it left me hanging, but in a good way.  Ms. Day starts off where Reflected left off.  Eva and Gideon's love is stronger and yet always tested.  But their strong bond and love will never break them apart.  You get to learn more about why Gideon did what he did to protect Eva.  The passions is so intense with them that it pours out of the book, it's so hot!!!!!  I really cannot wait for Ms. Day's 4th book.  I love her style of writing.  A must read.  Hopefully we won't have to wait to long for the next one lol.
0425269205|5.0|This book came super fast, excellent customer service.  And it is, hands down, the most beautiful special edition I have ever received.  Anyone that is a Charlaine Harris fan, and a Sookie Stackhouse fan should consider buying this wonderful final book.<br />The art work is beautiful and wimsical.  Excellent purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm waiting for the update you get buckets lava and water and spawning. eggs for cow sheep pig and chicken!!!!!!!! awesome I'm going to make lava falls. and a farm

B0068FZ1C8|5.0|I saw this movie with a bunch of friends when it was a first released, we're all the same age as the character so we all thought it was fun. Watching it now as an adult, I love the film, there are so many good messages throughout the entire feature.<br /><br />Jamie Bell does a stand out performance & this is the role that changed his career, he did a fantastic job & was recognized for it, which he truly deserved!<br /><br />The DVD: Works great, the menu is straight forward & easy to use.<br /><br />Overall: I highly recommend this to everyone, it's fun, sweet, entertaining & has a great soundtrack.
0307476073|1.0|Maybe it's my fault.  Maybe I was hoping to read something inspirational that  could help get more women to try spending a little time in the wilderness.  I was hoping that she would come to learn what I have learned; that the atoms that we are made of go back to the beginning of time, and that we share our origins with all other creatures, and that we come to discover this when we immerse ourselves in the wonders of the wild.  I wanted her to discover the feeling of accomplishment a person feels when she can carry her whole world on her back, when she can ford a stream or climb a hill or make a fire and listen to the impromptu choir that is birdsong.<br />Instead, what she does is, she spends years whining about the death of her mother.  She deserts the man who married her by cutting of all affection for him, sponges off her friends who take care of what few possessions she has, begs money from others while moaning and groaning about how sad she is.  It never occurs to her to offer solace the the others in her mother's life who were sad to lose her; no, she just resents the whole world for not comforting her.  And through the whole book, she never does one nice thing for anybody else.  In the end, she doesn't even acknowledge the gifts her mother gave her throughout her life.  She doesn't even make peace with her mother's death, she simply becomes numb to it.  She learns little if anything, and I feel kinda sad when I think about years from now, when and what she will impart to her own children.<br />If you're looking for adventure this is not it.  And if you're looking for inspiration, you won't get it from this self-indulgent, thoughtless crybaby.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|The plot is interesting, the animation is good and the characters are worth, really good voice overs, really good story, and it has really cool characters!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Having used FB for years it is nice to have an app to do the important things. New feeds, status updates, and pictures
B00BUVPIRS|4.0|Load times and frame rates are lousy on my wimpy tablet (Trio Stealth Pro) but that's not Dev's fault. Nice open-world play with fun character development. Could really use some sort of Alchemy system? (It might have one but I haven't even gained the ability to cast spells yet)....<br /><br />Overall, well worth the $6.99 I paid...
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|This movie will enable them to revisit all of the old story lines. It is a beginning for a new generation of fans.

B008EZVNO0|1.0|the worst van morrison cd to date...threw it away half way through..it was a pure waste of money..thank you. awful
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I got this today and headed straight for the Extended Cut.  Right of the bat, a graininess seems to show.  The backgrounds are hazy (airport signs/Obama's picture/etc).  There seems to be static even in the close ups of just faces.  It's a little annoying.  Some scenes are crystal clear and perfect, but then you get more graininess a scene or two later.  It's really odd for a Blu-ray of a movie this new to look like this.  (Sometimes older movies look grainy when converted, but that's because of their age. - Newer movies, like say The Last Stand, look flawless.)  I figured it might just be the movie itself, so I popped in the DVD too.  It actually looks better!  The graininess is less apparent. I didn't watch the whole movie again, but I flipped around a bit. I even compared the scene of John and his daughter from the Theatrical Cut. There is sort of a staticiness around her cheaks that is less so on the DVD.  Did I just get a bad Blu-ray disc or is the DVD superior?  I should note that I watched both of these on the same TV and on the same Blu-ray player.  What's the deal?<br /><br />I may return this tomorrow, and see if another copy is the same way.  If I do, I'll post in comments.<br /><br />I'd appreciate other comments, because most of the reviews focus on the movie and not the Blu-ray/DVD.
B006UG909U|2.0|I simply get over how badly recorded and produced this entire album is. It sounds like it was recorded in someone's garage using $20 microphones into low budget gear. The whole album sounds like it has a brick-wall low pass filter around 6Khz, the tracks are mostly a train-wreck of a mix with no definition and are all monophonic for the most part. I would really like to enjoy this release, but can't get over how bad the entire thing sounds.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|Was a little disappointed with this movie.  It was good, just not what I expected.  I don't think I would have purchased this movie if I had done more research on what it was about.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|love this movie recommend it good to watch when nothing is on tv good to travel with to use it on dvd players
0425263924|1.0|Sylvia what happened. I knew this was not going to be the end bt I'm pretty disappointed in the turns the story took. Eva....I was rooting for her on RIY but this time around she seems childish, insecure, nymphomaniac and super needy. It seems like the relationship didn't grow at all they just sexed their was through.<br />Gideon, WTF just more secrets on top of more secrets. And these desperate women always swarming, lurking in the shadows. Still doing things behind Eva's back like she's a damn child....well she does act like one often.<br />Don't think I'll read the next Book. I thin this story has met its demise. PLease end this drama marathon because its plain boring.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|recommend this have watched it like it veery much some times can get this on tv was good to watch
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Death spares no one, but some live with death hovering relentlessly over them until their last breath. The reality of the side effects of illness and impending death are honestly, hilariously and bluntly expressed by Hazel and Augustus. Their experience will change your view of your own fragile state, have you ponder your own beliefs of an afterlife and of how you're living as you slowly, daily die.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|movie is great have to like scary movies I think there funny at times some people may not think that, some parts not funny but good dvd

B004P8JPS6|5.0|Answers all questions as to how Reacher evolved and his military career ended. Tom Cruise is NOT Jack Reacher by any stretch of the imagination. Haven't seen the movie and don't intend to. I liken Cruise to Mary Poppins, just a spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This was one of the most anticipated books in the series and it was well worth the wait.  Given past references I was not sure that I could like the character of Kaleb.  But Ms. Singh managed to make me a big fan of this spectacular character and his leading lady.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next instalment in this series.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|Bon Jovi does it again. Very good CD. Love the hit as well as many of the others. He is awesome as usual.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved it! Kept me up at night playing it. Challenging but not so hard it was frustrating. Wish it didn't end so quickly (more levels)

B00BEXB18M|1.0|This album was one that I was looking forward to.  With the disappointment from 13 still bothering me, Super Collider was supposed to be something to reinstate my love of Megadeth.  I have been a fan of Megadeth since I was young and have never missed a show.  Unfortunately, the last few performances have been dry and boring.  Little did I know that the lack of energy on stage will continue in the studio.  Again I wanted to love this album like so many of the past albums (yes even Risk) but the name was awful.  It sounded like something a child would call a demolition derby car.  Fine.  I'll wait to judge the rest of it.  Purchased the CD.  Listened.  Maybe I heard it wrong.  Listened again.  Perhaps I missed something.  Listened one last time.  Oh boy was i bored and tired.  This album is a utter disaster.  Only one song was worth listening to.  Kingmaker open the album well.  Not anything to be excited about like Holy Wars or even Blackmail the Universe.  It just opens it.  Afterwards the album sounds like background noise that one can easily tone out unless they are trying not to.  The first time I listened to the album I found myself relistening to know whether or not I truly listened to it.  The lyrics were boring with little thought.  Beyonce or any other generic \\"musician\\" could have written these for Mr. Mustaine.  At one point, Megadeth offered lyrics that explained what we all could relate to as American citizens; discontent for something we love because we know what America can be.  But the lyrics rarely spark any imagination (due to the lack of effort put into them) and do not move the listener forward.  Dancing in the rain was an awful illustration to move the idea forward that we are living in a Rousseauistic America.  Mr. Mustaine perhaps feels betrayed because libertarian politics can not exist in the sea of bureaucracy that America is drowning herself in.  Dancing in the rain was probably my least favorite song due to its terrible music and awful, uneducated lyrics.  The Blackest Crow was a very close second most hated song.  Although anyone studying the evolution of music can be able to link folk music from the turn of the century to blues, then to jazz, then to metal (remember Gar Samuelson was a jazz musician before choosing to play in Megadeth) using a banjo and neo-blues themes (heavy bass drumming and slower tempos) was not a good idea.  Those two songs were by far the worst.  Honestly I wouldn't recommend this album.  I wish Megadeth well even though since the return of Mr. Ellefson has lead to poor bass riffs again and removal of Mr. LoMenzo and albums like 13 and this trash seem to be what to expect.  However, due to how important Megadeth is to me personally, I will probably purchase the next album.  Hopefully, the betrayal will not be felt again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|when r u putting out the new update 4 kindle? maybe y'all will fix the problems that came with the iphone update b4 u put kindles out
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is a very fun game to keep kids entertained.... I like this game its very fun and keeps me entertained. On long car rides and trips. I think kids will enjoy it maybe even adults...
B00BEXB18M|3.0|I feel positive about most of the tracks here.  Super Collider and Burn! are pretty weak, but the rest of them aren't so bad.  Every time I have listened through this album I have enjoyed it, if only moderately.  This strongly differs from 13, where I thought most of the album was very weak.<br /><br />The production is a little better than 13, but I am sure many will not like the modern sound.<br /><br />There are a few good Megadeth trading solo moments on here, like those on Off The Edge and Don't Turn Your Back.<br /><br />Blackest Crow and Dance In The Rain are the most inspired tracks on here.<br /><br />TSHF, UA, and Endgame are great in my book.  13 was pretty bad, but I think that Super Collider is a step up from 13.<br /><br />The 1 star reviews and the 5 star reviews are full of it.  This album is not fantastic, but it is also not garbage.  Believe it or not, there is a middle ground: Mediocre.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I think they should graduate and then get married. And live happily ever after and have kids and Macon should find  a way to get Ridley her powers back
B007N5YIUS|5.0|i chose this rating because my great-grandson loves itl  He is 5 years old, and his brother is 3 years old and is learning to play it too.  It keeps them occupied and they are learning to use the computer, kindle, and phone. Win, win, win.
B000HL09MG|3.0|I really like Nicole Kidman....Tom Cruise not so much.  This was definitely not up to the quality I expected from those 2 big name stars.  Very slow, and somewhat predictable...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's probably the funest game that I will probably ever have on my kindle fire I love this game it is fun fun fun!!!!!!!! :) :) :)
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I get  to the mune then it says you need 563 mb or somshing<br /><br />Help me out I t looks asome
B00A8307BG|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this latest release from Robin Trower. As a very long time RT fan, I think he shines best during live shows but I will never overlook a new studio release. On the positive, I am so happy to see he is still doing what he loves. This album offers the trademark Robin Trower honey-toned \\"fat strat\\" mosaic sound we all love.  All of his signature licks, chirps, tweets, crunches, scrapes, and diminished runs are there.<br /><br />The issue I have is there is nothing really exciting here. RT chose to rearrange and cover mostly famous blues songs duplicated a thousand times by other rock guitar players young and old. RT offers some humility in the liner notes by admitting it difficult to surpass the originals so his rearrangements were merely an attempt to offer something new in appreciation of these great songs.  Fair enough, but I don't think it works completely.<br /><br />Worse still is RTs choice to take the vocal reigns on all songs. While not as disturbing as the first time I heard Satch put out an album with his vocals, RT should have rethought this strategy on a whole album given his very limited vocal range. He isn't bad within the small pocket he finds comfort.  However, half of a great blues cover is the vocal. For the life of me I will never understand why so many people think they can sing blues. It is MUCH more difficult to pull off then most people think.<br /><br />All that said, I do find this album entertaining. Now through multiple listens I find it to be a most enjoyable listen -especially while styling on the porch, sipping on a glass of well-crafted, very old Scotch. The low-key feel and lack of tempo differentiation on most tunes allows one to drift off in thought and just relax. Only a couple of originals here and I think those are the real highlights. Sheltered Moon is wonderful, old-school RT.<br /><br />Bottom line: classic Robin Trower guitar style and a relaxing feel --3.5 stars
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm writing this to get 3 gems. the game is all right. you kinds do the same stuff over and over again. overall okay app
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game, now I'm just waiting for the update that already came out for ios, but this really is a great game
B00B2166BS|5.0|This charges the N10 5 times faster than the stock cable. It finally solves the problem of battery not charging fast enough to keep up with consumption, and the problem of N10 not being fully charged even after plugging in for a full night.
0425263924|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"Entwined with you\\".  The characters have more depth.  The relationship with Gideon and Eva is finally working out where they have learned to have trust in each other.  They talk more and volunteer more information to each other (less secrets) which is how a relationship should be.  They are there supporting each other , and I enjoy that Gideon continues to show how in love he is with Eva.  He is always there for her and taking care of everything he could with her.  Eva is his world and he shows it (more than love) is what he meant by saying that what he feels is not the right word of just \\"love\\". He takes so much and gives up so much for her.  Eva is stronger than before, and he stands by Gideon.  I believe the author did a good job now showing how their relationship is growing and you cannot do this over night and hurry things up in the real world.  Although certain scenes I was so confused In the second book \\"reflected in you\\" there were so many questions that was more difficult to see the answer (the fight in the office with the blood, certain things said with so many fans asking questions on this) but this was to hint at the trust issues.  In this book, they have learned to trust and not constantly being jealous as they both know in their hearts that they belong to each other.  But Gideon still has his side of the story that needs to be explained about his past.  This book shows the security of their relationship and will probably lead to tackling and solving Gideon's past to help him heal with Eva by his side!  I am enjoying watching their relationship grow on the inside as well as on the outside.  They constantly do not have a break with Exes but they get through it together.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Received the DVD as scheduled. High quality product at a great price. It was a beautiful film. I loved it.
086547897X|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for a budding animator, and so far, the feedback is extremely positive!  This is an excellent resource for anyone interested in animation, novice as well as experienced professional.<br /><br />Will update with more feedback as I receive it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game and I Love how interactive it is. My daughter likes to play with me too. She likes to see how real the horses seem
B00CXG8Z1K|4.0|First of all, I totally disagree with the first reviewer that this album is horrible.  To the contrary, 'Inspiration' is wonderful. If you're a fan of the Nat King Cole classics, you will love this album.  George's vocals are at their best.  When George started doing more singing (Breezin' and forward), he was compared with Nat Cole who began as a piano player but went on to become a legendary vocalist.  I in no way imply that George is in Nat Cole's league, but it's great to see him and his 'inspiration' come together so beautifully.
B00B4804OE|5.0|I consider this as more of a spinoff instead of part of the story. The race at the beginning was one of the best one I've ever seen in any FF movie.  Cast is solid, considering all of the unknowns in this movie at the time.<br /><br />Curious if they will attempt to tie this film in with FF7 or leave it to stand on its own. If they don't, at least give it its own sequel.
B00095NX9G|5.0|This video(s) is great and challenging like you wouldn't believe. I have been dancing for seven years, and it gave me a whole new challenge, yet it's easy enough for a beginner to start dancing with. Really fun, and Rachel is easy to follow along with, and the choreography is exciting to learn. Worth every penny!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I am trying to understand why people are disliking this book and I cant figure it out. it seems a lot of people are upset about 4-5 book!! I actually enjoyed this book, it wasn't rushed ( obviously, it took her a year to freaking write it) and I love how their relationship progressed. I can see the 4th book and then I see cary getting his own spin off. only thing that got me pissed is that it costs $10!! ebooks should not be that much but I guess that's what happens when your series is a hit. am hoping next book will be their HEA, cant see a 5th book about Gideon and eva
B008JJM88Q|2.0|I got this app for my Kindle Fire HD for my 8year old and I to play. It's a fun app and we had a lot of fun trying to find a character it did not know. After about a day my kindle would freeze and would take along time to do anything. The game would also get hung up and we would have to start over. Long story short...I uninstalled it from my Kindle and off the cloud, I also went to setting and deleted cookies and such to make sure everything would be deleted. My Kindle was back to normal. I then was curious to see if in fact the app made my Kindle run so poorly or was it because I had not deleted cookies, and  cache and such in a long time? I reinstalled it and sure enough same problems. SO I deleted it again and my kindle is working as it should.  I will not install this app again! I'm surprised that Amazon allows apps that are clearly harmful for Kindles and a security risk.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have always loved the movie Rio and now I am glad that they combinded Angry Birds and Rio together and made it a really fun game to play and to keep kids entertained. Thank you Amazon for having this in the app store :)
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|It's really a shame this author chose greed over substance.  I preferred Bared to you over 50 Shades and recommended it to many of my fellow readers.  When I began reading reviews and found this is not the final book in this \\"Trilogy\\" and that there will be two more to come, I had to make the decision not to finish this series.  $50.00 is just too much for me.  I hope Sylvia Day reads her reviews and understands the mistake she has made as I am sure she has just lost a lot of fans.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I love, love, love this prenatal workout video!  I was an active person before getting pregnant (mostly mountain biking, some jogging or gym), and the first time I tried this video, it kicked my butt!  My legs were wobbly and I was sore the next day, and this was just the first trimester.  I continued doing the video a couple times a week because it moves fast, has good instruction, and was fun.  I always felt stronger and looser (especially my back and neck!) after doing it.  It got easier as I got stronger, and by the end of my pregnancy, I almost felt more full-body strength than before I was pregnant!  Erin is reasonable and understanding about pregnancy issues (tummy gets in the way, always have to pee, etc.), but has a positive and motivational attitude.  The 40 minutes flew by every time I did this routine since the intervals for each exercise are short and it keeps the pace moving.  I liked that I also felt I got a decent cardio workout (more than yoga, but still in the ~140 bpm max recommended during pregnancy).  Now that my baby is born, I've transitioned to the postnatal video (more like rehab, starting very simple and slow with various levels of progression), and I am regaining my core strength, flexibility, and balance again.  THANKS ERIN!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy to learn and responsive. I'd you enjoy solitude you will like this one. You can customize it and play different levels of difficulty with one, two,three or four suits.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Other than a few creepy references to Ashtoreth, thought this was an incredible game.  Graphics were beautiful and puzzles were challenging but not ridiculous.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game for the kindle it is minecraft on the go I just updated it v0_70 Alfa and I just built a city
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I love my Retina and never thought I'd have to use a wire again...after all everybody has wifi, right? Except that we moved (very unexpectedly for my husband's job) to the Florida Keys and our wifi connection is sloooooooow because everything down here is at least 10 years behind the rest of society. Heck, our wired connection is sloooooooooow too but it seems to be the only way I can upload 60MB files, which I need to do frequently for my work. So I use this adapter and it lets me do my job from the Florida Keys, which doesn't suck.
B0058YPL66|5.0|The villains seem to have deeper character development, but that could just be my bias. Great and addictive show, though!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly has become one of the stars in the nerd pantheon...it's one of those rites of passage that everyone seems to have watched.  But Firefly is more than that.  Over a decade later, Firefly remains simply a good show.  The brief series stands the test of time because it relies on characters, relationships, and good writing rather than flashy effects or grand action sequences.  Firefly remains worthy of its fandom because its characters and its themes still resonate, and that's something work acknowledging and watching just one more time.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We like  english movies.  This series has been very good since season one. The end of season 3 was sudden.
0425252868|5.0|The amazing story of the December 1943 encounter in the skies over Germany between a Luftwaffe fighter pilot and the pilot and crew of a shot to pieces B-17 is one that almost defies belief.  Fortunately the authors of this book have produced a gem that, like many great books, is almost impossible to put down.<br /><br />The authors tell the reader of the lives of Franz Stigler and Charlie Brown before and after their wartime encounter.  That telling is filled with wonderfully vivid descriptive narrative.  An interesting tactic is used throughout the book of frequently mentioning by first names only Stigler and his comrades along with Brown and his bomber crewmates.  This method gave me a sense of knowing these men as ordinary people first and members of their armed forces second.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Another great addition to our Disney collection! My husband received this movie for his birthday from a family member but we wanted it in the combo back so he returned it and we ordered this one. So happy that we did!
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|My Grandaughters and I love this!  It is an absolutely cute movie<br />which contains some valuable information concerning issues which would be<br />important to children.
0547391005|5.0|My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves George, and so do I.  These stories are the perfect length for bed time, and my kid seems to follow along with them and loves the cute illustrations.<br /><br />Sometimes classics are still winners!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is very entertaining. I enjoy playing it and love the World Tour. Maybe the next destination could be London? (Hint, hint, hint!)
0394806220|5.0|My kiddo loves to make the noises in this book as I read it, and I enjoy the game myself. lots of fun.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I love this musical.  It moves me everytime I have seen it in the theatre, cinema, and now at home.  I couldn't pass up the ability to own it on Blu Ray, DVD, digital copy, and in the cloud.
B00BF11STU|5.0|The movie is a good movie and I thought it was pretty spot on with events.  I Would watch again.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Very good read, love all the twists and turns, very suspenseful.  Have trouble putting the book down.  Will read more Reacher books.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This was my favorite series.<br />Was. Way back when I thought it was a trilogy.<br />Completely lost my interest.<br />Really, really not worth my anticipation and $10. Really.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|This is a very fun movie, that explores responsibility and choices (and their consequences, both good and bad), while keeping the tone rather light-hearted.  I found the interaction of the various characters and their somewhat stereotypical, but loveable, idiosyncracies to be very enjoyable!  And seeing the effect of the growing friendships was also great to watch.  Not my favorite movie ever, and a tad bit predictable at point, but a fun and clean movie that is enjoyable whether you believe in the tooth faerie or not.
B0090KZDSK|1.0|I have never not completed a series once I've started it but I will not purchase any further books in the Crossfire series on principle! Entwined with You was a huge disappointment and reeks of money grabbing laziness on behalf of Ms Day and her publishers. The ending was a crime against writing and is almost grounds for complaining to a consumer rights commission. It came out of nowhere and left me feeling like the author just got bored with the book and randomly decided to stop. The book prior to this is made up of Gideon and Eva saying I love you for approximately 70 percent of the pages. There is very little in the way of plot, instead we are inundated with repetitive sex scenes and pointless dialogue. The fact that there are a further 2 books planned astounds me and points further to where Sylvia Day's priorities lie. I'm sorry to say artistic integrity was sacrificed for the chance to squeeze more money out of loyal fans. I'm saddened as I truly believed this series on the basis of the first 2 books, deserved a good conclusion. I've read most of what Sylvia Day has written (usually in one sitting, such has been the quality of her work) but I feel she has truly let herself down with this one and lost a loyal fan
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this movie!!! Being able to watch it on the Kindle Fire HD was really helpful at her doctor's appointment!!!
8866137634|5.0|Those times when you cannot use your laptop or phone to write a note but are committed to technology, this fills that niche.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was looking forward to this book and it was boring . I really do not know if I will buy the next book. I really love the first two books and really love eva  and Gideon together .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like the hover boards because you you just get to ride around. I can't wait until I have all the characters.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an app that let's you use your brain without having to read instructions on how to play (like having to figure out a strategy game). My 7 year old loves it, and I like the harder levels. Good game. Mindless but smart at the same time. If you like puzzles or organizing, you will probably like this game.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I thought it would be a lot more funny.  I was a little disappointed.  I saw the clips and thought it was really going to be funny.  It turns out the clips were the only funny parts.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Best 3d animal and dinosaur game ever it's just that I wish they could make it easier to get peanuts.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie.  I wasn't disappointed.  I feel the acting could have been a bit better, but on a whole it was a good movie.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest.  I go to it on my Kindle, on my phone and on my computer whenever I am looking for the perfect recipe, book ideas, anything that I need at home and on the go.  It is a must that I never knew I needed until I became a member.

B0068THAGY|5.0|This is an excellent story I just happened upon.  A group of school boys are making a film to submit in to an amateur film festival when they witness a horrific train-truck crash.  This leads to the unraveling of a multi-faceted political suspense thriller with a superb plot, excellent and realistic characters.  The story is too good to reveal too many more details.  This has all the attention to detail and expert use of technology and effects we expect from Abrams and Spielberg!  Watch this film!
B000JQUHLM|3.0|I loved the Disney movie as a child, great, fun, read. Took me back to being a kid spending hours in the library on a rainy Saturday.

B001P06GX4|4.0|Blokus is a fun quick filler board game for children and adults.  In the most simple explanation, you are trying to place all of your pieces (which are of various shapes) on the board.  The only problem is so are your other three opponents.  Each of your own piece can only touch another corner of your own color.  So careful planning and strategy is required to try and accomplish the task.  Each player starts off on a corner, as you play, the planned placements change because what you saw was an opening, is no longer there when it's your turn again.  The game is best played by four players.  With three players, we play with each player taking a turn for the non-player color.  You can also block off a part of the board and play two players, aka Blokus Dou.  In fact, I recommend it this way for two players.  It's better than each player picking two colors to play the big board.<br /><br />Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.
B008JFUMHE|5.0|My mom and I went to see this today.  I have been sick all day.  But, I still really liked this movie.  This movie has things happen in a really interesting way that will make you want to watch it again.  The way they did the stuff they did was so cool.  Also, this movie did not really have to many things going on.  I mean, there were complex things happening, but it moved at a pace that was easy to follow and understand.  You see the characters as I individuals, then later on as a group.  They have a point to their actions.  Though they are not sure really of why it is.  Hen ending will surprise you.  Great cast, great acting, really fun story, memorable movie that I will pre order.  It very much reminded me of something from e 80s.  Very well done.  Heck it out if you get a chance.  I I Lyon hope you enjoy it as much as my mom and I did.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Nothing special about this game. You do not get enough coins to really make it fun. There are better coin games
B008JJM88Q|1.0|I played 5 times. It took 26 -  43 guesses for each character. It also kept asking duplicating questions and / or obviously bad questions.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|If you love Uno you will love this game. It also learned a lot of the rules I did not know. Now I am kicking butt in regular on online UNO
B00422LESO|4.0|I got so many caught up in the storyline that I read the whole book in a day! I really liked Jane and how we never really knew what was real in Austenland. That made the ending even more delightful. Fun and quick read.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This is a very fun game!  The art, colors,  everything is very well crafted! I enjoy a lot playing! One of the puzzle game!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I didn't know what this game was until my friend told me about it. I started playing and was immediately hooked. Your just walking around and the out of nowhere your dead. So much fun definitely worth the dollar. BUY IT NOW!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I loved this book as I did the other two, however I think writer, publisher, whomever is getting greedy, $10 per book is ridiculous.  I absolutely love Gideon & Eva and how in love they are with each other.  Great job Sylvia Day, but take a minute and rethink your price, your fans love your books, but to think it was a trilogy like FSOG and the price also, but then to find out its more than 3 books not to mention a whole lot more expensive is not getting you rave reviews.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I have really enjoyed this series. Jeaniene Frost has created a world of interesting characters and fun, sexy story lines. And who doesn't enjoy a kickass heroine like Kat & a sexy vampire like Bones who loves his woman!
B00BF123WG|5.0|Learning about some the facts in the movie were an eye opener..I'm going back to definitely buy the blueray!...Sometimes you have to be willing to make the hard choices and thie movie showed that clearly..
B002RVCD6O|4.0|Kept my interest throughout the film. Enjoyed the character development and teenage interest in the opposite sex! Remembered that awkward age.
B007712XAU|3.0|The set was enclosed in plastic. I assume it had never been open. The disc that skipped had about 5 shows on it. I was disappointed with that
B008Y79HE6|1.0|This sums up the entire movie: When actors and directors are oblivious to how the human body works (ears, in this case), they have no business being in the business. In one simple scene, an injured asian guy says, \\"godzira\\" and the actor opposite immediately says, \\"Did you hear that? He said Godzilla!\\" No, moron, he said \\"GodZIRA\\" -- we all heard him! But you and your director aren't working with the common sense of phonics; no, you read the script and were too stoooooopid to notice... as was the writer as well.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|BTY and RIY were amazing ... Waiting 8 months for this was a real disappointment.  This third book was suppose to be about Gideon revealing his secrets ... Instead we get sex scene after sex scene, no plot and 10 different threads to be undone in the next 2 books.  I feel this was just to make money ... At $10 an ebook that would be $20 times nearly 80,000 likes on FB or a potential $1.6 million in sales.  I am so done with this rip off.  That is a shame as the wonderful love story Gideon and Eva had in the first two books was simply \\"lost\\" with this third book in the quest for profits.
B002YDTPHA|3.0|You already know what's gonna happen, maybe not in which order so that adds a little bit extra to the wondering mind but other then that it's ok. Was not a fan of this one or 5, especially 5, they tried way too hard. This final destination is a ok movie if your bored.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I usually don't write a review, however, this little app I use on a daily basis. It's very pleasing to the eye and provides a lot of information about what I am capable of doing with the amount of battery I have remaining, for example video chat,playing games,taking pictures,voip etc. It also tells me how long for a complete charge via plug or usb. If your going to use any battery apps this one is the best I've used by far.

B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The story is a sad one with intermittent attempts at some humour, but this rarely works. The child abuse is heartbreaking and one can understand how a child's soul could be destroyed in such circumstances, and his,and her,  destiny. However even though the story plot is sound and redeeming, the writing style did not appeal to me.
1895565375|5.0|People who have made negative, often weird, comments about this book must be very young or were never loved, or perhaps abused, by their parents.  THIS BOOK IS NOT WEIRD OR ABOUT ABUSE.  This book is about the purest form of love anyone can experience, the total love of a parent for the child, and how that love grows and matures and becomes reciprocal, from a child to a parent.  When my son was young, I used to love to watch him sleeping, I was totally amazed at what a blessing it was to have been given something so precious and how much I cherished my child.  You cannot understand this wonderful love unless or until you experience it yourself.  What brought tears to my eyes, is at the end of the story, when the mommy was old, the roles flip, and the son rocked his mother and sang the same song of love to her.  There is nothing like this kind of total love in the world, except that felt between parent and child.  It is a total love -- free from any negative motives -- just straight out love and trust for another human-being.  If you never had the opportunity to experience this kind of love, I recommend it to anyone.  It makes the soul sing for joy!!!  Beautiful Book!

B000VK7KVQ|5.0|My brother got me to watch this movie and then I ordered it for my kindle fire.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was utterly fantastic.  Great movie.
0061950726|4.0|I'll be honest, I didn't want to read this book. It sounded so depressing. Orphaned children shipped to the Midwest for free labor? Ugh. Heartbreaking!  But as I gained momentum in my reading, I realized that the train is just a starting point. A metaphor for where life takes you. Sometimes you are  merely at the mercy of the route., hopeful for a compassionate conductor.<br /><br />While the subject matter is indeed bleak, the main character's perseverance and hope overpower even the worst conditions.  Dorothy focuses on her future, even after Mr.Grotes' &#34;violation.&#34; When she finds she will be staying with Miss Larsen temporarily, her &#34;heart is swelling with joy.  Miss Larsen is taking me home with her! I can't believe my good fortune.&#34;  Instead of focusing on the tragedies of her recent past, she focuses on the present and considers herself lucky.<br /><br />Christina Baker Kline challenges the duality of name and identity.  While names are a major expression of identity for most, names are more fluid for others.  The main character accepts her imposed name changes and these names come to mark sections of her life. She begins as Niamh, the little Irish immigrant girl; older sister to her siblings and (temporarily) to Carmine.  Her name is changed to Dorothy at an attempt to Americanize and acclimate her. As Dorothy she works in the small sewing sweatshop and then survives the squalid Grotes. By taking the name of a deceased daughter at the request of her &#34;adoptive parents,&#34; Vivian slides into place as a smart,  hard-working businesswoman at the family's general store.  She keeps this name for the rest of her life, except for her short time with  Hans, when they were once again Dutchy and Niamh.  The name changes symbolized the lack of true identity allowed to Niamh.<br /><br />The dual storyline was well applied and the similarities between Molly and Niamh are sadly accurate.  The tragedy of unwanted children lives on even though the orphan trains do not.  The intention of the agencies in regards to these children is to place them into any family, some far from worthy.  We are all too familiar with the statistics and tragic outcomes of many cases.  We also know of the success stories; what we hope will happen to orphaned children or those in foster care.  What we rarely see or hear about are the ones who barely made it.  Foster children at the mercy of a system are appreciative of simple necessities. Food, clothes, and safety are constant struggles in both of these characters' lives, but education weighs the heaviest.  Dorothy wants to attend school but is told she will not.  Later she walks miles to attend school merely as an escape from what waits at home.  Molly may not be doing great in school but her love of books as consequences that change the lives of both the women.<br /><br />I always applaud a novel that celebrates education and great teachers, but I absolutely loved Dorothy's teacher, Miss Larsen. The author did a wonderful job creating her. An underlying comparison came through the story to me with Miss Larsen.  The juxtaposition of her violet scarf and pink skirt against the greasy grey scenery of the Grotes paralleled the transition from black and white to color in &#34;The Wizard of Oz.&#34; Both Miss Larsen and Glinda, the Good Witch, send their Dorothys down the right paths to safety.  The Dorothys both wake up safe in bed with someone to care for them.  The dream is over.  The fever has broken.<br /><br />The two women's education brings them success.  They each had one person that changed their life in regards to receiving that education. Miss Larsen saved Dorothy by getting her placed with the Nielsons.  Vivian saved Molly by honestly understanding Molly's struggles and assisting her with her portage assignment.<br /><br />Christina Baker Kline took a dark social experiment and turned it into a complex examination of place and identity.  What I initially approached with skepticismis now a new favorite book that I am recommending to anyone who will listen.is now a new favorite book that I am recommending to anyone who will listen.
1572816112|5.0|I adore these cards.. They are sort of creepy and weird, but intriguing and unlike any cards I've ever seen before. I did not really use them for reading as of yet, I just really like to hold them and get sucked in to the dark images. I do have a friend who has also purchased these cards and she gets really deep and accurate readings from them... worth the money...
0061122416|5.0|This is a very intriguing, enlightening and inspirational book. It's a road map to figuring out your purpose in life.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book lacked in many different ways.  First I didn't feel Eva and Gideons need for each other as much in this book as I did in the first two.  The author tried to tell the reader through words from them like \\" I need you Eva\\", but I didn't really feel the raw emotion or the need or angst like I had previously.  Secondly, it lacked in depth of the storyline.  I felt like I was just going through the days of Gideon and Eva's life and nothing really captivated me.  If there is going to be more to the story I expected  a few more twists and turns to keep me on my toes wanting more.  But this book didn't do that.  I was disappointed.  I really thought more would happen in this book.  I enjoy these characters and it makes me sad that this book did not really do them justice.  I hope the author steps it up in the next book because this one was a bit of a disappointment as sad as that is to say.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|ok I really enjoyed the first two books.., this one its really sweet how gideon is towards her and showing how much he needs her, but thats it, nothing happend!!! I really did not enjoyed this book, hopefully 4th would be better!!

I was channel surfing one night and came across Kat Edmonson and Norah Jones doing a show on PBS. Norah had already performed and Kat Edmonson was signing. OMG it was wonderful. I ordered Norah's CD because I had missed her performance. I am happy with the CD, and expect any Norah Jones fan will love it also..

However, don't not try The Greatest Journey.  The vocals are like listening to a symphony.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|what happened to my book??? where is my book??? i so looked forward to the release of this book,it was on my mind like you wouldn't believe. did not get what i was waiting for:( i read other reviews and saw a lot of people are upset about extending the series,they wouldn't be so upset if the book was great.i thought the first two books were great,i felt everything they experienced together; when i can feel, you've got me! this book,i felt nothing. the love scenes read great,but no feeling, at least not from me.<br />i thought waaaaay too much time on other peoples story,peoples,plural. ex: mark and stephens,isn't megumi just the receptionist?,a little less time spent on corrine, just a little tired carey, what was the purpose of the parents sleeping together? i know all of this can be explained in the other books,but they really hold no interest for me. my interest was and is gideon and eva not all of the distractions around them. i don't think they had one peaceful moment in this book that seems to be evolving from a really hot,erotic love story to maybe a mystery? a who helped alibi gideon and why? not interested,not in that as a main focus for another book. gideon's and eva's story is still there,just get back to them,not some stupid sex tape, did they really need something else to add to the pile.( man ,this pile is pretty big) for no appearant reason.<br />i really don't want to say ms.day is milking it for the money, i want to be more positive in my life, and it is just a book. not my first bad book,i'm sure , not my last. i want the story back. the way it was in the first two books. i don't care how long you make the series as long as i feel they way i felt when i read the first two books. i don't need all the other distractions, i need more gideon and eva not distracted by anyone, getting to know each other,dealing with their chilhood trauma's that has shaped their lives and relationships,making the adjustments in their lives for each other,resigning yourself to fact that their has been a murder committed on behalf of this relationship ,justified or not,and how you deal with that, the relationships they have with their parents,which i find so much more interesting than all of the building up of characters outside if the family unit. i want more gideon and eva, a lot more gideon and eva, they're to bogged down with other stuff,i want pay $9.99 for the other stuff.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Love this show!!! I found it by mistake, once started watching it couldnt stop. If you enjoyed Glee, you will diffently want to watch this.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I started reading this book months before i got married. Stopped reading it for a while and thought it would be better if i started from the beginning, was amazed on how much has stayed with me even during those months i stopped reading it. It helps me understand what love really is an  knowing what is my love language is will help me an  my husband avoid going through what a lot of marriages go through these days. I definitely recommend this book!
B006O7XOOW|4.0|My son recieved this toy when he was 6 months old. He was a little young for it at first, but now at 10 months old he has been enjoying it for a couple of months. He loves the balls but also loves to pull up on it and spin the wheel that makes the \\"volcano\\" action spill the balls out over the edge. This toy has never fallen over when he pulls up on it either. I've read negative reviews saying it's not sturdy and that the balls spill out onto the floor and don't fall down the edges like it's designed to. We've never had those problems. Biggest complaint is that the final step in assembly is to screw the legs on and it was not easy. For that reason I took a star off.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game is really fun and addictive. But it is a little over board after playing a couple rounds my eyes start to hurt. I like the original version better.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am a huge fan of this series, or I guess I should say I WAS a huge fan of this series. After waiting a very very long time for this installment, which i THOUGHT was the last in the series, I'm left feeling incredibly disappointed. It would have made perfect sense to wrap everything up in this book, however, the stories just keep going on and on - one tangent after another with more and more (unnecessary) characters introduced. Eva and Gideon are some of my favorite characters in this genre--there should have been more focus on them instead of so many tangents in so many directions. Absolutely NOTHING was wrapped up by the end of this book, and the reader isn't even really left with a cliffhanger. Instead we're just left with a ton of open ended story lines. The book just abruptly ends--like the author had to fill a quota of number of words or something, got to that point and just stopped and said the story will continue in the next book. Total garbage. If you haven't already started this series, DON'T. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time or money.
B000IOM1YG|5.0|This was my introduction to Alan Parsons, it was so long ago, I can't remember the exact year, late 70's maybe?  after this one, I got Irobot, which is another good one.  It's only my opinion, but I think Pyramid is the best album he did.  and i'm showing my age, because I just said \\"album\\".
0425263924|1.0|I've read hundreds of romance books - some good, some not so much.  I have never been so irritated that I felt a review was necessary.  Before Entwined, I thought Sylvia Day had Shayla Black, J.R. Ward or Olivia Cunning writing quality potential, but now feel she has the Beth Kery rip-off strategy going on. As readers, we purchased Bared as the 1st book in a trilogy.  I agreed to spend $30 to read Gideon and Eva's story.  I would have NEVER agreed to pay $50. I completely disagree with Sylvia's recent statements that there was too much of Gideon's story left to tell to wrap it up in one book.  WHAT IS LEFT TO TELL? We know what happened to him. We know he has unresolved coping issues, family issues, co-dependency issues with Eva, control issues, anger issues and is worried about being found guilty for murder. I just wrapped all that up in 1 sentence, but she can't do it in a whole book? At this point, she's turned Gideon into a \\"sally\\", Eva into a spoiled brat, Cary into a bigger mess than he was before, Monica into a gold-digger (even less likeable than before), Gideon's mother into a \\"B\\" and Megumi, Mark, Steven, Corrine, Lacey, Christopher, Ireland and Martin are nothing but add-ins with no charachteristics that readers can latch on to. And it's no love triangle when the idea of Eva thinking about Brett after everything Gideon has done for her makes the readers lose tolerance for Eva. Although Gideon and Eva get married, the way that portion was written, you have about 2 seconds to enjoy it and then it's over. No romance before, none during and none after. There's a ton of sex, which is fine by me unless it's used to replace the actual story (a/k/a filler). The end was abrupt with no cliff hanger and no reason to care what happens next. I'm angry that I spent another $10 and got no ending; I'm irritated that we had to wait so long; and I'm mad that I will never know the ending because I refuse to spend another $20 just to pad Sylvia's pocketbook a little more. Completely unprofessional.

B000009MF7|5.0|This disc, compiled from recordings made in 1994 and 1996 and with two orchestras in two venues, nevertheless delivers a remarkably consistent level of inspiration, playing and supportive recording qualities. The slightly warmer ambiance of the London recording given to the Left Hand concerto makes sense compared to the cooler world of the G major concerto and Valses from Cleveland.<br /><br />The glue that binds the music making is, of course, the superb pianism of Zimerman who seems ideally tuned to the fastidious world of Ravel on the one hand coupled with Boulez's dispassionate style of music making on the other. If that seems too analytical for musical satisfaction, then the total result in practice is a set of performances that can be compared with the finest available from the last 50 years and not to its ultimate disadvantage. The G major concerto as played by Michelangeli has been a yardstick by which all others have been compared since it was first issued. Most subsequent performances have yielded to such a comparison but in this case Zimerman is able to rise successfully to the challenge aided by more modern recording. His performance of the Left Hand concerto is equally fine so for those looking for a coupling of the two concertos, this makes a strong case for consideration.<br /><br />The Valses are treated to a coolly dispassionate performance by the Cleveland orchestra under the very watchful eye of Boulez. This suits the nature of the set very well and their inclusion on the disc acts as a suitable interlude between the two concertos.<br /><br />In conclusion I would suggest that this disc deserves very serious consideration as a potential purchase especially from those interested in the two concertos. The Valses simply enhance that attraction.

1572816112|5.0|These cards are very nice and get straight to the point. When I want a quick and honest answer, I can count on these cards. The artworks is beautiful and sometimes comical which is what initially drew me to this deck. It comes with a little white book so it the images are still pretty open to interpretation. The quality feels pretty nice too. They are a pretty thick stock, and the images are printed with pretty nice detail. I am pleased that it came with a box to put the cards in. I highly recommend these!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I've been excited for this album to drop since they first announced it. I was little reluctant to order it off of Amazon because I had ordered some other CDs from them and they came with broken cases, but this album arrived to me very soon and is in perfect condition! I love this album so much.<br /><br />The Album itself is great. Hands down my third favorite QOTSA album. It may not be as heavy as &#34;Songs For the Deaf&#34; but it's definitely one of their best albums. This is one of those albums that one can put on and just be transported into a whole different world. That world is ominous and yet beautiful. It's more than an album, it's something to be experienced. My favorite tracks are &#34;The Vampyre of Time and Memory&#34;, &#34;If I Had a Tail&#34;, &#34;Kalopsia&#34;, &#34;Fairweather Friends&#34;, and &#34;I Appear Missing&#34;.

1451695195|5.0|What a relief it was to read \\"Proof of Heaven\\" - to know that we put so much effort into this narcissistic, materialistic world when in fact as Eben so beautifully writes, this world is like living in a small closet compared to the world beyond.  Thank you Dr. Alexander for making it your assignment to share your experience with those of us stuck in this world.  I can only hope that our focus turns us back to using our consciousness to move us closer to God and all that is available to us.

B000Q6GUTI|4.0|I liked the movie and the acting was great, the language was not bad.  The only thing I didn't<br />like was the political overtones.  It was a little bloody too.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I wanted a happier ending. It seems like a filler. When's the final book. We waited a long time for the third. I'm glad they married but how many sub plot can you out into the book that was suppose to complete the triolgy.<br />I feel like Eva when Gideon disappears.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It took a bit for this continuing story to pick up steam, though I enjoyed the \\"surprise\\" event on the island. The ending was flat. Just no sizzle at all. And with all that nonstop sex, why does Eva need all those trips to the gym?  Not sure I'll care what happens in Eva and Giddion's future.

B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Maybe it was just me but this book gave me whiplash. It was just all over the place- the characters, the settings. It just wasn't my kinda book but I'm sure someone else could love it because the writing itself isn't bad. I personally think that with a little more time it could've been better refined to be a great book

B00475AYJQ|5.0|I love this series maybe too much.  ive actually bought this book and the first in hardback and kindle editions.<br /> ill buy it again if it makes #3 come faster!  Kvothe is a great character not just because he wins EVERYWHERE but<br /> because he is also flawed, and sometimes an idiot.  you cant get that kind of characterization from a lot of fantasy<br /> these days, and the time PR puts into these books really makes them shine.  the sequel will be so long in coming i may<br />not even hear about it on account of how ill be in the nursing home though... 8)

B001SZ2Y4G|5.0|This has long been a favorite of mine. Great performances from all the actors. Paul Newman was fantastic as the cigar chomping evil business man! The film is a nod to the film makers from Hollywood's golden age. Lots of fast dialogue and a great story about a small town boy trying to make it in the big city. It seems like an old film but has a modern Coen brothers edge. If you like the Coens you will likely enjoy this one immensely!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I just finished reading the book.  This is not like the first two in the series.  It was boring and drawn out.  The ending was anti-climactic.  I don't think it's worth waiting for 4th and 5th book.  Disappointed on the quality of the plot.<br /><br />BTW, the characters are horrendous.  Spoiler's coming up: Corrine's infant..that's probably Gideon's and still alive.  Eva's stupid.  Gideon slept with Corrine.  Also, Gideon most likely set up Nathan's killer, too.  And yes Eva, is stupid.  As a woman, I'm insulted on how she behaves and choses to remain friends with Brett who she's sexually attracted to.  The author adds more people in the mix...but really who cares about them.  Yes folks, the book is lame.<br /><br />Toss this book in the trash...you won't miss a thing!
1401201911|4.0|I never bothered that much with the Superman story as it was so dull and predictable.  This version offers a fresh new insight and angle on it.  What is most enjoyable to me is that it reinvents the entire DC comics universe. Batman is also recast as a Russian which works quite well. The alternate view of casting Luthor as a not that different yet not quite a bad guy is brilliant.  This is highly enjoyable and well written and accessible to even the most casual fan like me!

B004JN1D2I|2.0|(SPOILER)<br /><br />I have read the first three books of this series. And I have now totally lost interest in it. Mr. Martin created a very interesting world and interesting culture(s). My main criticism of this series is twofold:<br /><br />1. The story is all over the map with far too many points of view. This series needed a good editor who would have had the guts to tell Mr. Martin, \\"enough already, tighten it up\\".<br /><br />2. In my opinion there is nothing wrong with killing off a couple of major characters. It adds emotional resonance to the story. But let the reader get the idea in his/her head that all or nearly all major characters are going to bite the bullet then said readers are going to distant themselves from the characters. They are going to cease to care about and take interest in what is happening to those characters.<br /><br />Those were my two main criticisms of the series. As to the violence in the series...well a medieval type culture probably is going to be very violent. But we the readers are not living in a medieval culture. With all the violence, the series is just plain depressing. I don't need to read a series to get depressed, I can do that just fine on my own.<br /><br />I will continue to recommend other books by Mr. Martin because I do believe that he is a good writer. This series will probably become his tour de force. That saddens me a bit because this is not my favorite example of his work.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Really love the layout of the screen. Easy to find information on my Kindle. Enjoy the British perspective on our news, too. :)
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I LOVED the Gideon and Eva story from the start. I had finished FSoG and wanted something with less scandal, when I came across Gideon and Eva. Hooked doesn't even begin to describe what I was. No book compared to their angst and love. That being said, I disliked book three like none other. You spend every other page with them in bed and the storyline going no where. I enjoyed the fact that Eva was growing in her relationship but she quickly slipped back into her previous behavior. I'm extremely disappointed that this book is being dragged into two more books and our beloved characters are falling to the side :(
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I finished the book a couple of days ago, and needed a while to decide what I felt about it. With nearly 2,200 reviews already posted, it's unlikely that anyone will ever read this, but I often write reviews just to help myself sort out my thoughts regarding a book. While reading, I couldn't put the Kindle down each night until it practically fell out of my hands as I fell asleep. Few books that I read these days have such a hold on me. Though you know that she obviously survived the ordeal of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail alone, there are many suspenseful moments where you wonder whether she will escape unscathed and unharmed.<br /><br />Cheryl's life was a train-wreck after the untimely death of her mother, the disintegration of her family and divorce from her husband, her sex addiction and dabbling in heroin use. She was on a path to self destruction at the age of 26, when she lit on the idea of walking ~1,000 miles of the PCT. Though she prepared to a certain extent by buying trail books, researching and acquiring backpacking equipment, packing and mailing replenishment boxes to various milestones along the trail, she was spectacularly foolish and unprepared in general. She did not break in the boots; she did not fully load the backpack and weigh it before packing; she did not try out her equipment (brought the wrong kind of fuel for the stove); she did not step one foot on a trail or hike even one night to determine whether she could actually do this... Certainly, if she had a living mother this would never have happened !<br /><br />Nevertheless, due to fool's luck or sheer grit and determination, she hoisted the backpack and trudged through 1,100 miles of extreme weather and trail conditions. She occasionally got lost and ran out of water, at one point lost her boots and walked in duct-taped sandals for several days, encountered menacing strangers, lacerated her feet and lost 6 toenails in the process, came face to face with bears and rattlesnakes, and constantly ran out of money due to poor planning. She wrote \\"nothing bad could happen to me, I thought. The worst thing already had.\\" (the loss of her mother)<br /><br />She made friends along the way, met trail angels, acquired the nickname \\"Hapless Hiker\\", and experienced PCT trail magic - \\"the unexpected and sweet happenings that stand out in stark relief to the challenges of the trail\\", such as spectacular sunsets and coming face to face with a big-eyed doe who approached Cheryl. And, of course, she came to terms with the bad things in her life and found healing, and she learned to \\"trust entirely in the kindness of strangers\\" (otherwise there would be no book !)<br /><br />Though the format of the book seems a bit formulaic at times, the prose, sometimes graphic detail and absolutely brutal honesty regarding her past transgressions and weaknesses rescues this from being just another \\"I survived against great odds\\" tale.antly ran out of money due to poor planning.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I've waited for this book and was looking so forward to see where the story of Gideon and Eva was going but it didn't quite do it for me. I liked the book but I was disappointed too. It's hot & Steamy like all of the others, however it still leaves you wanting their story and waiting for book 4??? I will admit, I want more of Cary story. The first & Second book in this series gave more to the plot than this one. I think it was heading in the right direction, but with all the sex scenes it never reached the story that I was waiting for. I think this would have been better as a short story or tease to the story everyone was hoping for. Looking forward to the rest of Gideon & Eva story but I hope the next book doesn't leave us with more waiting of a HEA.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book was definitely better than the movie, I suggest seeing the movie before reading so you're not disappointed at the movie for not being as good as the book. Definitely a book I'd read more than once, it was worth taking two days out of my life to read, if it was possible to give this book more stars I would.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|First off I love Silvia Day's writing and her books, however I have to be harsh on this one. This was supposed to be a trilogy but seeing that the first two did so well the author and her pillaging publisher decided to milk the cow for all its worth and stretch book #3 to add 2 more. Something that I despise.<br /><br />This book feels like a postcard of an original painting, makes you money but its not worth anything as an art piece.<br /><br />It's all about the money in this stretched bubblegum storyline. Greed is awful and ruined the whole experience of this series. I will not be surprised if in 2 years this expands to 10 more books.<br /><br />....it could have been great, I love the characters, but it was the biggest disappointment of one of the most anticipated series this year

B0067EKYS6|3.0|To date there have been a number of movie adaptations of Gatsby, the 1974 version starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, being my favourite; so when I heard Gatsby was about to get the Baz Luhrmann treatment, I wasn't quite sure what to think. See, like the decidedly mixed reviews on this film, I share similar feelings about Luhrmann's movies in general. While I adored his modernised interpretation of Romeo + Juliet, I could barely make it through Moulin Rouge. Seeing Gatsby was a gamble for me because while there's no doublt Luhrmann has a monopoly on contemporary flare and visual excess, he also has a tendency to skim the surface, missing much of the underlying detail. So what was the end result?<br /><br />His Gatsby fell somewhere in between the two.<br /><br />It's hard to know where to start because my thoughts on this movie are all over the place. Though I did enjoy the theatrical experience in a visual sense, emotionally it was incredibly unfulfilling. Not exactly what you expect or want from an adaptation of one of the most hailed novels, like, ever. So yeah. But honestly, was I surprised by this? Not really. It ended up being exactly what I thought it might be: visually striking but lacking in depth and character. It all boils down to way too much focus placed on the aesthetic parts and not enough on the \\"meat and potatoes\\" of the film. Sure, there are brief sparks of something special, but overall, it lacked a lot of the heart and soul that comes from the original source material.<br /><br />Luhrmann's Gatsby is imposing, in-your-face and brash which works both for and against it. This forwardness has a tendency to highlight the obvious making it lack the subtlety that makes earlier versions of the movie so much more effective. For instance, you're beaten in the face with the symbolism of the green light so much so that it feels like you're being insulted. Look Baz, the green light is important, I know, but we're not all that dense, okay? There's something to be said for leaving an air of mystery, of which this movie did none of. However, that being said, I do think he excels in creating striking cinematography which keeps you riveted to the screen. He makes you not want to look away because his world stands out from all the rest. The opulence of this movie matches the excess of the Roaring 20's to near perfection and it sets the stage well while enhancing the mood. I also really liked Luhrmann's use of contemporary music when contrasted against the vintage-inspired glitz and glamour. I know this isn't something that will please everyone, but it worked for me. It's Luhrmann's trademark and he does it well.<br /><br />That being said, good visuals aren't enough to carry a movie. I think my biggest issue was the lack of personality. Don't get me wrong, the setting had plenty of it but where it mattered, it had little to none. There was very little natural chemistry between Leo DiCaprio's Gatsby and Carey Mulligan's Daisy. They were solid individually, but not when they were together. I mean, this is the key relationship in the movie and it didn't feel real. And if I'm being real here, I wasn't vibing on Leo's take of Gatsby at all. He was too disingenuous and self-serving for my liking. If you ask me, Robert Redford pretty much has the monopoly on the multi-faceted character. He was self conscious and refined in all the right places. Leo's angry, angsty Gatsby was fitting only in bits and pieces. What I did enjoy, though, was Mulligan's Daisy. She brings a stronger, more defiant side to Daisy's otherwise flighty, dainty damsel-in-distress act. It's a refreshing twist on the character, for sure.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed (and not in a good way) was how the story was told. More often than not, Nick Carraway's (Tobey Maguire) narrative was mistimed and misplaced, frequently jarring me out of the story. It made every second of the 2hr 23min running time seem that much longer. So that on top of the characters notfeeling true to the characters in the book, it was hard to foster a connection to anyone of them --- and in a story that ends so tragically, you want to, no, need to be moved. I, on the other hand, couldn't care less. Baz Luhrmann's Gatsby, unfortunately, was a swing and a miss It's not that the movie is terrible, it's actually pretty enjoyable if you can take it at face value. It's got jazz in all the right places, if you know what I mean. I just happen to like prior versions better, that's all.<br /><br />And on a side note: I still think Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of Romeo + Juliet was the pinnacle of his directing career so he's definitely got that going for him because that movie is AMAZING.<br /><br />Food for Thought: While Baz Luhrmann's signature flare worked in tandem with the rich excessiveness of the decade, his version of The Great Gatsby missed the mark in just about every other way. There were strong performances by each of the characters individually but when together, they lacked chemistry. I found caring more about the way the film looked than I did any of its characters which defeats the purpose of translating such a deep and meaningful story to the screen. This movie is all about face value in a world where there's so much more beneath the surface.feeling true to the characters in the book, it was hard to foster a connection to anyone of them --- and in a story that ends so tragically, you want to, no, need to be moved.

B000VSYDRM|1.0|Interesting movie but the ending was just plain weird.  One scene prior to the end is very bizarre and pornographic.  I was interested in the outcome of the character until the nudity.  I can't give details as it would give away the ending but it was over the top and the rating should be X on this one.
0393343405|3.0|One has to scratch one's head a bit and concentrate to come up with positive things to say about this book. Greenblatt has chosen an absorbing subject: the causes behind the disarray and cracks in the religious orthodoxy of 15th and 16th century Europe. What, in other words, lay behind the intellectual ferment of the Italian Renaissance. He (or his assistants) have unearthed much valuable material on the subject.<br /><br /> Regrettably, that material is overwhelmed by the book's  disagreeable aspects. Not least among these is its patronizing and priggish tone, making it feel as if the author is addressing his Harvard undergraduates. More serious are the strident atheistic polemics. Greenblatt, who sounds at times like Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens, makes little effort to disguise his anticlerical rants as historical analysis.<br /><br /> Then there is his story's hero, Poggio Bracciolini, the otherwise obscure Vatican bureaucrat and scribe, whose fame is based on his retrieval from rural monasteries of ancient texts, most prominently Lucretius's poem On the Nature of Things.<br /><br /> The author's thesis is that the circulation of Lucretius's Epicurean poem with its celebration of earthly pleasures and denial of an afterlife enhanced the skepticism of literate Italians  toward religious orthodoxy. Along with other revived classical works featuring materialist pagan themes, Greenblatt argues, it undermined Christian traditions and ultimately led to secular modernity. Greenblatt refers to this turn of events as \\"the swerve\\".<br /><br /> But rather than a \\"swerve\\" Greenblatt's contention seems more like a stretch. Poggio and other educated elite of the period were already obsessed with the lost glories of the classical period. They surrounded themselves with ancient sculptures and fragments of monuments. More importantly, Poggio and his friends went in search of lost classical works in libraries near and far.<br /><br /> The \\"Swerve\\" thus puts the cart before the horse. The preoccupation with things ancient preceded and encouraged the circulation of Lucretius's poem, not the reverse. Such influence as Lucretius may have had was only one element among the many intertwined cultural, political and economic currents that together formed the Italian Renaissance.<br /><br /> A minor but irritating feature of \\"The Swerve\\" is its citation of events which, while influencing the narrative, remain  unexplored. There is, for example, the period when three different individuals claimed the papacy. The entire church hierarchy, including of course Poggio, was dramatically affected, but Greenblatt provides no background on the causes of the schism. Similarly, there are multiple references to the Council of Trent, but a reader unfamiliar with the intricacies of that historic event is left ignorant of its import without engaging in his own research.<br /><br /> In short, we have here a work that delves into a fascinating period of history with disappointing results. It confuses the reader by steering him in a mistaken direction. Rather than \\"The Swerve\\" the book might more accurately have been entitled \\"The Stretch\\".
1781162646|5.0|Devin Jones, a college student from the University of New Hampshire, gets a summer job on the North Carolina coast at a \\"B-List\\" amusement park called Joyland.  This book was published by Hard Case Crime which specializes in pulp fiction stylized novels that many of us cut our literary teeth on back in the `50s.<br /><br />Now, close your eyes and get a feel for what a writer of King's caliber can do with the premise of a young wholesome college kid dropped into the edgy setting of a Theme Park; Carnie folk; a murder in the Horror House ride; A ghost and serial killer; A young wheelchair bound boy; Heartbreak; and the wonderful beachside setting of the Carolinas.<br /><br />The cast of characters pull Devin, and the reader, along as the plot unfolds.  Lane Hardy runs the Carolina Spin, a huge Ferris Wheel, and gives a lot of fatherly advice.  We have a Fortune Teller who may actually know a thing or two.  Devin lives in a rooming house on the beach owned by Mrs. Shoplaw who also has insight into the goings on at Joyland.  Also residing in the boarding house are Erin who is a Hollywood Girl photographer (see the great cover art) and his new buddy Tom.<br /><br />The day-to-day work-a-day world and jargon of the characters in this small time carnival atmosphere is so interesting that the reader soon feels like an insider.  Central to the plot is the mystery of a murder that is eerie and disturbing but keeps the novel moving along.<br /><br />If I need to find a fault to round out my appraisal it would only be that the main character is telling this tale from 40-years after the fact so the reader knows that nothing fatal of life or limb transpired back when he was coming of age in Joyland.<br /><br />I am a fan of Stephen King but this is only my second Hard Case Crime book and I found both excellent.  In fact, after finishing this one I went on line and bought a couple more.  Great writing, great premise.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have never written a review, but feel compelled to do so to mitigate all the one star reviews from people WHO DID NOT EVEN READ THE BOOK. This book was great. Very reminiscent of the first one. I loved the development of Gideon and Eva's relationship. I enjoyed and appreciated the side stories of Megumi, Cary, her mother, and Corinne. Some people reportedly hated this character development. It did not distract from the book at all. There was a lot of sex in this book, but geesh, no more so than the other two. Isn't that part of the reason we read these books?? Personally, I could not be more thrilled that there will be two more books. I love to read, I love to read about Gideon and Eva, I love that I will have two more opportunities to do so. As for the BIG cliffhanger that everyone is moaning about; it ends in a very similar fashion to the first book. I was not left disappointed at all. Can't wait for the next one.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|A little to technical for my taste but the story held my interest. Not really like the TV character, but a fun read.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a fantastic white noise app.  Multiple rain, wind,  waves, thunder, and various other relaxing sounds can all be mixed and matched to lull you to sleep.  I have used this app on many nights to help me doze off.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Works well in the following configuration(s)<br />Iphone 4s with Otterbox - no need to remove case for the following:<br /><br />Sony Dream Machine clock Radio<br />iLuv clock radio<br />Generic iphone speaker dock<br /><br />Purchased additional units for wife's office radio, etc after using originally purchased item for 2+ years with no issues
B000T433L0|4.0|This is just not an 'ordinary' movie.  For that alone it has some merit, but if you have a desire to see different perspectives on things, this is worth a watch.  It is excellently made.
B001XUIBNO|3.0|It is a very well made film but the #1 reason I watch a movie is for the story, and I just didn't enjoy it much.  I know this is because of the way it ended but I have liked other movies without the typical happy ending.  I also must admit the acting and directing were great.
B00785P2QC|5.0|The only thing I have against the game is that my son loves it so much is that he's always borrowing my kindle fire when I want it. LOL
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really liked the story and it was fun to play I liked that you could do an alternate puzzle instead of the hidden objects if you wanted to
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It is the best game you have to get this app. it has animals that are very nice to you. and they can be you're pets. but not the wild ones that you find.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|love the challenge :) it is always. so much fun to do, this is one of my favorite games. it is super fun
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I LOVE the books! Gideon and Eva are amazing characters and I just want to continue reading forever! Hurry up with the next book I am going to go insane waiting!
B008JF8O9M|2.0|Very few printers supported, I couldn't fine one that worked with my Brother.  Never could get it to print, it might be ok if you have one of the models listed.
B004APVI1G|1.0|This was a very hokey video. It was a very strange story. As we watched it, we felt it was trying too hard. It had some nice 3D and visual effects, but not enough to make it worth buying, or watching again.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I'm now a huge fan of how Michael Lewis writes. Really Looking forward to reading the rest of his books.
B004XZ99LO|2.0|I bought this because it was a cheap option to try out my 3D Blu-ray player, but didn't like it. We soon lost interest. It did have some cool 3D effects, but not enough to make it worth the cost.
B0082JYEEO|5.0|I bought this album because it was the deluxe version which included &#34;Call Them Brothers&#34;<br />Regina has never disappointed me and I'll always remain faithful!!!!
B009X2CRMK|5.0|I lake Kate Mortons books, because they have interesting plots. The storin in this one is specially complicated and keep you in suspense right to the last chapter.The story has so many levels and it moves effortlesly between past and presen. Keeps you on toes right to the end.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very well done, makes you think a little, which is good. I like the graphics and also the story. Waiting for upgrades!
B004H4XI5O|3.0|but it is interesting and shows you how those geniuses with amazing memories aren't so different from you or I. it does teach you some basic memory skills too.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I heard amazing things about this book before I read it. I also heard that the ending was weird, and that a lot of people didn't like it. I wouldn't let anyone tell me why they didn't like the ending, and I'm not going to tell you guys either. I don't do spoilers! After reading it though, I completely agreed that the story was good, but the ending fell a little flat for me. That's not saying I didn't like it...it was just such a shock, and something that you don't usually see in books. For this reason, I respect Gillian Flynn for stepping way out of the box. KUDOS girl! The whole book was a definite mind-you know what.<br /><br />i thought that \\"Gone Girl\\" took a little while for the story to pick up, but once it did...everything fell into place and made complete sense. It started out 'slow' for a reason. And then you realize it really wasn't slow at all.<br /><br />I would recommend \\"Gone Girl\\" by Gillian Flynn to Mystery and Thriller fans. People who like a good story that will blow their mind will definitely enjoy this book. If you are looking for something with lots of twists and turns, finger pointing with whodunits, just to get more twists and turns, and a whole lot of \\"What the...?!\\" --- then check this book out. Gillian Flynn knows how to write a mystery and keep you on the edge of your seat with lots of suspense...turning the pages as quick as you can finish them, and not wanting to put the book down. She knows how to write a story so good, that whether or not you liked it, you'll be talking about it. It will stay with you after reading it, and you'll want to run and tell someone about it. Tell them how much you loved it, hated it, were shocked by it, or whatever! But you're going to want to talk about it!<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars!<br /><br />Happy Reading!<br />Brianna Lee Book Reviews
B000RO9VJK|5.0|the moral of the story is if you want to be an entrepreneur, spend more time working &#34;on&#34; your business not &#34;in&#34; your business. Recommended reading for any person looking to start their own business
1118109791|4.0|I decided that it was time for me to pursue my MBA and I wanted to be prepared for the GMAT as much and as quickly as possible.  I did all the research and this book is the study guide that was developed by the test makers, so my decision was already made.  The book was cheaper on Amazon and I would get it quicker too, so that was a no brainer.  I am almost done studying this whole book and I am setting up my test date towards the end of July 2013.  It's a must buy for those wanting or needing to take the GMAT.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|The book has been reviewed to death by lovers and haters. I felt it was good and interesting but fell short of the 4HWW and the 4HB
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I use the sweeper all the time now. The handle could be a bit stronger but if you don't abuse it it will be fine. Goes a long time before needing a charge. We have cats and it picks up cat hair off the carpets even...Keep up the good work.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Gripping, twists and turns, keep your attention.  Love being able to watch commercial free and before you can buy the discs.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Great Movie!  like the collectors custom case/sleeve.<br />The dude abides.  You out of your element Donny.  The rug really pulled the room together.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is a great way to pass the time.  Not too hard, not too easy.  Reminds me of the old school motocross game. Love it.
B00A7W29BE|1.0|I love the idea of using my Kindle Fire as a scanner, especially when I'm doing research in the library, but I wish to heck someone would explain to me where the switch and how to turn it on!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Awesome  amazing cool fun super great spectacular fantastic. Best  ancient  love  itfunnnnnnnnnnn. N.  itNnnmmmmmmnamaziiiingcoolstupidgrearesrt it. Graduate. Fun handsome. Exciting strong
B008JJM88Q|1.0|its on the free list and has so many addons and it is not even free its two dollars and all its good for is breaking your tablet
B004DLPXAO|1.0|It would not show up on my tablet and Amazon would not let me try to install it a second time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love this game!! Keeps you entertained!! I wish there were more mystery boxes..and you are able to get more flamingos as you go through the game. need more keys too but I still love the game it's addicting!!!!!!
B00005N5S5|5.0|Termintor was the movie that put Arnold Schwarzenegger to super stardom. This movie also propelled Linda Hamilton's (Beauty and the Beast tv series) career as well as Michael Biehn's (Tombstone, The Rock and The Abyss) career. Also a little know actor Bill Paxton (Tombstone,Aliens) This movie is one of the best sci-fi apocalyptic movies of all time. Not only that, one of the best movie lines ever said and parodied....&#34;I'll be back!&#34;
B008JJM88Q|5.0|this game looks like alot of fun to me! I would give it a 5 star! from, The Random Person. thanks
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|EXELLENT PRETY GOOD MOVIE , EVERY THING GOT SUBTANCE FROM THE VERY BEGIING TO THE , AND ALSO SEEM TO HAVE A SECOND PART, DOES'IT
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|It's not a bad game for being free. Though the first level is mindless. It looks to be a pleasant diversion if you need something to do
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Awesome way to kill time in a motel room when waiting for something more onteresinteresting to happen.  The reactions odlf the pudding blobs when you mess up are priceless.
0425252868|5.0|This is one of those books that you just can't put down. Better yet, its a TRUE STORY. The book begins telling the story of the German pilot, his childhood continuing through his early start in flying, the bases he was stationed at then into the War. Next the book introduces the American pilot, Charlie Brown, his early life briefly and his start into his flying career and his introduction into the War. The description of Charlie's flight crew members is wonderful and you can actually picture them from the authors description along with what their bomber was truly like, the air bases they flew from etc. You can feel their anxiety and fear and courage each member has through the excellent writing. This is one of those books that puts you right into the pilots seat, the waist gunners area and even in the ball turret with these guys. You really feel for these guys, you're worried for these guys, you hope they just get back to their base safe. I won't go into anymore details as to not spoil anything for anyone who has not yet read this wonderful book. What I can say though is, is, this book really needs to be made into a movie. This is a TRUE STORY WHICH NEEDS TO BE TOLD ON THE BIG SCREEN! These guys are the true heroes of one of the greatest generations. There are too many movies depicting absolute untrue and ridiculous story lines and here, already written out is this miraculous story of War AND Compassion with the compassion being shown from none other than a German officer. If that isn't enough, these 2 men then meet each other years and years after the war and embrace like long lost brothers talking and remembering when, a long time ago, they were sworn enemies to each other fighting for their respective countries. This storyline rates right up there with Band of Brothers, The Pacific and Saving Private Ryan. Please make this into a movie as it so truly deserves to be.
0425263991|5.0|This book continues the theme of Singh's characters' facing dark parts of their pasts and overcoming them. There were no great misunderstandings- a trap I feel too many authors use to create conflict between the HEA and Hero. Still, the conflict was undeniable, tragic, and believable in its resolution. The twin stories of the psy/changeling conflict blend beautifully with the conflicts between the two main characters. There are enough glimpses of previous characters to leave you satisfied in their reminders but also curious to see how they will continue to grow. The prose in this book was also well balanced with the suspenseful action. There was never too much time spent on poetic descriptions of the scenery that you lost your place or wanted to rush forward to get back to the plot. The sex scenes felt well built up in both passion and steaminess. And thereiss a good deal of the powerplay between the HEA and Hero to add some kink to some of the scenes that readers of Nalini's more gentle characters in previous books may not have expected the author capable of constructing. This is a book I am sure I will read over and over again. I will admit, after the high of Kiss of snow and, for me, the let down of Tangle of Need, I was glad to see Nalini back in stride. This book is all that we have been waiting for from this character. LOVED IT
B005HSL626|2.0|I was playing fruit ninja and chose to play arcade. The screen says ready set go. I try slashing at the fruit but can't. In classic mode it does the same thing. Zen mode is fine at times. When I deleted the app and then reinstalled it. It still did that thing.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Although wordy in parts, I enjoyed the last of this trilogy.  The character development and the twists in the story made it interesting and captivating.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Recommend to EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!amazing!!!!!!!!!love it!!!!!!! Best book I have ever read. I am so obsessed with this series!!read it!! Worth the $
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I'm really liking this game. It's awesome.  I hope that maybe in the near future, there will be a part 2.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Sooo disappointed. Why not finish this series instead of dragging it out. I am a fan and have read the other books in this series I need closure darn it and Entwined does not provide it.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I will admit that I had little interest in reading this book prior to the movie trailers and I went in knowing that the book would be vastly different.<br /><br />Personally, I had no issues with the format, where the story, as it were, is being told through a series of personal narratives.  This is a great format for people with little time to read and/or short attention spans.  The problem here is that each narrative sounds much like the others.  Brooks fails to give his characters their own voices and instead creates entirely one dimensional and seemly apathetic survivors who's only show of emotion is through profanity, with few exceptions.<br /><br />You feel nothing for these characters as you read.  I felt no fear, no sadness, no shock. Given that the intention of the narratives, as stated in the beginning, is to give a human face to the war, rather than just facts and figures, Brooks epically failed.<br /><br />Others have said this before, but it is true that you can remove ten of these narratives and the book would not suffer.<br /><br />I have to wonder if Brooks is even capable of character development at all.  You can give a person depth within a few pages; there are short stories enough to prove this point.this also seems completely off the mark.  Also, why can we not just blow the zombies into little bitty zombie pieces?  Why is this so complicated when you have a slow moving hoard?<br /><br />The celebrity narrative was just ridiculous.  Do I believe the wealthy would use that wealth to survive?  Of course!  The idiocy of their need to be on some reality show during the Great Panic?  Who is even cares at that point?  That whole scene was like a joke.<br /><br />Speaking of television, the news seems to stick around for a long time into the Panic.  I think Walking Dead had it right at the CDC when the doctor said that people left their posts to be with their families or make a run.  You think news anchors are going to stick it out for long?<br /><br />One narrative has a woman stating that her father began collecting gas when the Panic began.  How long was he collecting?  One day?  Living in NY after Sandy I can tell you how quickly gas will disappear due to fear.  Brooks did not have that reference, but if you read and watch enough on survival it's pretty standard to say you have three days until the country falls into chaos.<br /><br />In the Ukraine, just...what was that nonsense?  Let's poison everyone and see who reanimates to know who is infected.  If you're going to kill everyone anyway, just drop a bomb on them and blow them to pieces.  Less chance of reanimation.<br /><br />The reeducation.  I can say that yes, people would need to be trained with more practical skills than brokering deals.  I'll assume the author meant to be ironic in having a man, who is essentially organizing and brokering deals, narrate a scene where he laughs at all those former desk jockeys.  He mentions a class where a former house keeper is training her former boss.  In what?  What was her skill that was so necessary for survival?  They needed a class on house keeping?<br /><br />I am sure people will disagree with me, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amazing amazing !! I couldn't put it down I can't wait to read more from this author!! You will love iy
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is so fun!It deserves my 5 star rating!It keeps me busy for hours!This app isn't one of lousy cheap apps!
0425263924|1.0|I waited for months for this book! I dealt with a change in the release date and waited anxiously for this book to be released. I cannot believe that, after all that, I wish I'd never purchased it let alone spent hours reading it when I could have been reading something good! WTH?????? This series could have been over in book 2!  I actually thought this book was going to be from Gideon's perspective and that we'd get more answers about what happened to him and made him into the man he became.  Instead, I found myself hating Eva. I've been ranting about her selfish, bratty, horrible behavior toward Gideon to my boyfriend and he's never even read the series. The man KILLED FOR HER and she still couldn't believe he loved her, couldn't trust that he would do anything for her. REALLY???!!!!! Her character just became so tiring that I actually wanted him to just break up with her and save himself the headaches she kept causing. And what was up with her reaction to Brett??? She kept saying how Gideon was the only man for her, how only he could make her feel so much but she still felt some chemistry and sexual attraction to Brett???? Uh, he didn't care about you the first time around and he certainly wouldn't kill for you so that should be a no brainer!! I have no desire to read a 4th or a 5th book for that matter. All the new questions Sylvia Day created, 1) the Russian Mob, 2) Megumi (????do I care??), 3) Dr, Lucas's sister, 4) a sex tape 5) wicked mother-in-law, 6) Cary and his love triangle/baby, 7) Corinne........, none of it works, especially when this was supposed to be a trilogy. Like her Eve of Destruction series, it's too much of nothing masquerading as a decent series when it has nothing to offer except a lot of frustration!  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|After waiting so long for the book to FINALLY be released, I was majorly disappointed in the quality of the story.  The first two books were so much better and had more 'meat' in the storylines. It's as though they decided to make this a 'series' and Ms. Day had to make this book 'filler' to stretch it out.  The first half of the book dragged. Gideon/Eva sex is extremely hot, but, after a while, I was questioning when the story was going to pick up. When it finally did, it seemed to be throw-away material. The way Nathan's murder was 'solved.' Really?! That's it? A new potential love triangle was introduced and then...nothing.  All of this could have been fleshed out a little more. I returned the book.
1451626088|5.0|Great read, and it will always be a favorite since it was written by Philippa Gregory, my favorite author.  Once you begin reading, you cannot put the book down.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I bought this book at the start of my lunch and then couldn't put it down, until I had to drag myself off to a meeting. Reading your story and seeing elements of myself in it, and then seeing what I can do with my life is giving me hope and helping me get back on track. Thank you so very much for writing this.
B001AGXEAG|4.0|I bought this movie because I loved it growing up. It even includes two cartoons from the series too. Love it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I love love the &#34;Crossfire&#34; how ever this book was all over the place... Hope next book closes the chapter on Gideon and Eva!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|This David Baldacci thriller should open the eyes of the reader to the possibility of those in high places in government administrations deserting the values of freedom for financial gain. Trailers very likely can come from those who control the workings of the resources of this or any other agencies. Look out America, this could be happening as you read this very note.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Found myself speed reading to get through it; too repetitive and vague.  Did not enjoy it at all.  I have read several books about heaven and near death experiences and this was not near the quality.  Do not recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a really good game for kids that play it on computers that means they can play it on the go. Take the opinion from the kids. People this is a awesome game. It's worth the money.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I like most all songs on this album, which a rarity, especially these days.  Good mix of songs wont leaving you feeling like you are hearing more of the same..
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very fun to play. Whatever you do, do NOT use hints. The game is too short for short cuts. You'll regret it. About an hour or two of game time but definitely worth it. You've already probably spent at least $5.00 today on junk food or even worse. Spend a couple of bucks so games like this continue to made. There aren't many people out there making games that actually make you think. Thanks for the much needed two hour escape from my life.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Same thing with this tomcat as is with the other one. It's really cute and I like it but I have to talk rather loud to get it to respond to me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|its a good game and its like u can build ur own city and its a good game..i love it and u should play it too hcfffffff f f f f x f  ddf f f f d
B007BT0RKG|5.0|All you can ask for from a free product. The maps didn't take too much space on the device and were very clear to read when using it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have been waiting for the new update, and its come out for everyone on Apple... But when is is going to come out for the Amazon Appstore!!!!!
B008RJFRTK|4.0|Having pins and places of interest is nice, but considering that this is the only difference and the place of interest search isn't that great I may suggest sticking with the free version.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Never heard of these guys until they opened for The Who Quadrophenia Tour.  Just like The Who, they are a guitar, bass, drums and singer but full of soul. The singer is a combination of Wilson Pickett, James Brown and Otis Redding.  We were blown away, they are fantastic live.  We were not disappointed with the CD.  It opens with &#34;Blues Hand Me Down&#34; just like on the tour.  They go from pounding kick ass driving blues to sweet and mellow.  Get this, you won't be disappointed!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Great movie and fantastic visual effects. Watched this on 3D. DVD quality was excellent. The movie itself was entertaining and worth watching multilple times
B008ASGP3U|3.0|Ian Rankin's Edinburgh detective inspector John Rebus is a soulmate of LA's Harry Bosch, Michael Connelly's serial cop. Similar life style (except Rebus listens to rock when Bosch is into jazz), similar work ethic, similar family troubles, similar lack of political skills, which is damaging to their careers. Both are retired, both regret it, both have returned to cold case jobs. Rebus as a 'civilian', with a full reinstatement pending and subject to evaluations... Well, well, we know that means nothing good with a blockhead like Rebus.<br /><br />His former prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Siobhan has become a DI now. She works a missing girl case, and Rebus thinks there may be a connection to 3 old cases of missing women, all along a road leading north, with years between the cases. Are the cases connected or is this a fata morgana? Plenty of opportunity to behave unwisely.<br />Internal Affairs is still after him, suspecting him of collaboration with the underworld. His old underworld foe is trying to befriend him, which looks like a trap. The new missing person case might not really be part of a serial killer's track, but an underworld extortion thing...<br />Rebus gets entangled.<br /><br />When Bosch and Rebus retired, I had sort of retired from reading cop novels. The genre doesn't have unlimited possibilities. When Bosch came back ('Drop'), it wasn't great. Rebus' return is also not the greatest cop novel ever, but it manages to hold my attention.<br />Not a small part of the interest is the man's coping with new technologies, like the ubiquitous CCTV, and the social  media. Combine this with the key question in any such investigation: where do we invest our resources, which hunch do we follow? ... And you get an interesting case, but don't expect much uplifting wisdom. This is a bleak world.<br />And you get a thoroughly unsatisfactory ending. A main piece of the puzzle just gets ignored at the end. Also, Rebus plays a radically immoral and improbable stunt to arrive at a solution. For the last 30 pages, I reduce my rating to 3 stars.n. For the last 30 pages, I reduce my rating to 3 stars.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This app is so cool it's much better than the original mine craft. I play it all the time. It's safe for younger kids too. But it may be challenging for the little ones.
B00847KFDS|3.0|I'm spoiled by the excellence of CCR originals so (by comparison) the remakes pale by many shades. The new tracks are good, especially Mystic Highway. The rest is a celebration of CCR legacy but ho hum in the long run.
B00CFQMVLS|2.0|This is definitely the worst Die Hard series. Bruce Willis makes terrible comments throughout the movie and his overall performance is below average. The action is over the top-so unrealistic... It is shame that they made this movie... I really enjoyed the previous Die Hard series, but this one is just plain terrible. Don't waste your money and save yourself the time...
B00013M6NK|5.0|I needed a second battery for my Nikon Coolpix P520. I have had enough bad experiences with &#34; knock off&#34; batteries. I couldn't ask for a better battery, especially with all of the traveling and photo shooting I do.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Wish I was a tenth as creative as ol mate Kurt. Phenomenal read.<br />Full of gallowy humour and random off hand characters. Def an all time favourite.

B0002EXH40|4.0|I think this is megadeths best effort to date. Still keeping their metal edge while branching out and making more melodic songs. Which I think really works on this album. Still heavier than load or reload by Metallica, and I think far better songs. Songs that will still rock your face, and have a ton of hooks all at the same time. I think megadeth out did their self on this one. Still my fave out of the mega catolog!
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Hard core Eagle fans will love it.  Newbies to Classic Rock will trash their silly rap and learn what music really is.
B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt is one of the first albums I bought on cd. Popped it in my old disc man and was blow away. Dirt is one of those albums where you can listen to from front to back then listen to again. I think it is their best album. Starts off with heavy but catchy \\"them bones\\" keeps you looked in to the roller coaster ride till the song \\"would\\" at the end. One of my favorite albums of all time by any artists.
0802473156|5.0|This is great advice.  Maybe if I had this perspective during my first marriage, it would have been my only marriage.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|One of favorite metal bands right now if not my favorite band. After they came out it seem like every metal band after them wanted to sound like them. They keep coming out with fresh and new sounding albums without sounding stale but still keeping their sound and edge. Getting back their original singer Jesse which I think sounds better than ever. I did love Howard jones too thought. Their music is heavier than anything out there but then they'll have a melodic chorus that will just pull you I'm again and again. One of the best metal releases in a long time this band is always candy to my ears.
0425263924|5.0|Wow - I'm quite surprised at the backlash of Entwined with You and Sylvia Day.  It was announced months ago that Eva and Gideon's story would revolve into a quintet and that the books are being made into a series (on HBO or similar viewing channel).  EWY was long awaited for sure but was worth the wait.  Because Eva finally grew a set, she's being bashed as bipolar. Obviously the plot twists are clues to upcoming events.  The love story continues and I can honestly say I can't wait for next installment!<br /><br />If you are Crossfire fan, read the positive reviews as well.  If I had listened to all negative reviews when purchasing books, I would have missed out on a lot of great entertainment.  In the end we all have an opinion and I'm just glad I didn't let the negativity influence me.
B005C5A6C0|5.0|I love the blackening I thought it was the best metal album I have heard in years. Machine head just filled a void left by Metallica and pantera. So when I heard they were releasing their follow up to the metal masterpiece the blackening I was pretty excited. Pretty amazing epic album it's self it's own album and I think that's great. Machine head don't try to out do their self on this one but I think it's the next step in their metal evolution.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Smash had just enough of a comical and dramatic touch. I watched the whole season in one evening. Fantastic. Can't wait to watch the next season!
B00000099Y|5.0|I was blow away when I first heard this album in 96. Such a original band and album. Taking a huge step from undertow to this album. Going into a more progressive stye of rock, some songs clocking in at over fifteen minutes. It's one of those albums you can listen straight throught. Combining hard rock and metal on this one, and I can hear traces of influences from pink Floyd wall era on some songs. A must have in any rock or metal collection!
0316067598|5.0|This book is not just for men! I am a woman and couldn't put this book down for a minute. This book makes me proud to be an American and know that there are men and women out there willing to lay down their life for our country.  Such an amazing, yet tragic story.
B000002H97|5.0|I know alot of hardcore Metallica fans don't like this album. Alot of them say justice was the last good Metallica album. But I think Metallica was trying new things on this album and I think that's good for a band it probably gets boring doing the same thing. Stool keeping their sound and edge but making a brand of metal and rock anyone will like even your grandma! I thinks one of my favorites of the Metallica catolog. It's not master of puppets but its still a landmark epic album!
B003K16P3M|4.0|I love fantasy books more than most people, so I have rather high standards when it comes to the books I read. And the more I read them, the more repetitive the stories become. But every so often, one finds a story that brings in an interesting cast of characters, an engaging, well-told story, and quite a few surprising twists that leave one thinking. This is one such book, which is why I'm surprised I've never heard of it before.<br />I won't bother writing a synopsis here, as you can take a look for yourself, but the main character, Katsa, is one of the coolest & strongest girls I've encountered in a book since Daenerys from Game of Thrones. And though it's not told in the first-person perspective, the story certainly is centered on her, giving us the chance to see her interesting world through her eyes. Which is quite a refreshing change of pace, let me tell you.
B0000029DD|5.0|I'm a big metal head, so I usually don't like albums like this. But you can't denied Jeff's talent. Coming off like a mixture of led zeppelin and bands like the smiths and a little bit of the cure. Just the  first song \\" mojo pin\\" just crabs you and keeps building till it explodes into a ball of emotion. A little bit of everything on the grace album. To sad that Jeff passed so soon it's such a tragedy. We are in dire need of singer song writers like this in this day and age.
B00BSWMITK|3.0|i love joe ,but when you have as much material as he has its hard to sound fresh ! but great guitar
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I'm sure everyone has seen this movie, and seen the amazing performances by the cast. I just wish all other comic book movies would take this same path. I love most of the marvel movies but sometimes they take more of a cartoonie and humor route that sort of cheats their films. That why I love the dark knight so much it just goes for the jugular I'm the beginning and dosent let up till the end. It seems like they made this movie to blow people away by how awesome it is. I don't know how their going to top this when they reboot the franchise.
B005DESVPO|2.0|i thought for the $ it was a steal . there are a few songs that are on his black and blu cd . i lover the black and blu cd , but this was weak at best !
159562015X|4.0|A good managerial tool...you must compare your findings against and or with your fellow co-workers. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Like the title of my review says, the game needs to be longer. I was a little disappointed when I reached the end.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|And I'm a girlie, but this was really girlie.  It was ok, I wouldn't likely watch it again.  The premise of the story had me asking myself - how can they afford to live with no real jobs...  The scenery was great where ever it was filmed, I enjoyed that.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This is brilliant for gaming especially when there is a shoulder problem and cannot move your arm properly.<br />Easy to use and different coloured buttons are really cool.<br />Looks great and very stylish.<br />Would certainly recommend for avid gamers.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|I really had no idea what the premise of the movie was when I started to watch.  It's definitely a lazy afternoon, sit back and enjoy type movie.  Not the usual type that I would pick, but I have to say that it was thoroughly enjoyable.  I watched the scantest of reviews on this one and thought it was worth a try.<br />I was pleasantly surprised.  It's funny, it surprisingly has twists and turns that I never anticipated.  I would recommend this for anyone that just wants a very fun, light-hearted escape for a few hours.  It's is well worth it.
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|I am such a big fan of Lil Wayne, this CD was just great, if you are a fan of rap music. if not then this cd is not for you.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever, I am glad I spent the extra $ to get the platinum edition. :)
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|JT is back loved it. He is just a great singer his music. Waiting for his next album hope it won't be as long as it took for this one to get released.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|You are rewarded an toy epic face and a portal gun real one not a replica of one and a 5 stars got it every one  and I am 9 years old so don't make fun of what I say<br />Ok and I am awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004FK24ZA|3.0|Ordered the movie. It was not in English. Has subtitles. Hard to watch. Took away enjoyment factor for us. Disappointment.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Only thing they could improve is make acorns a bit easier come by!  The further u get in game the less motivated you become to continue!
B00486070K|5.0|The ethernet port on my iMac went out and rather than replacing the logic board ($$$) I purchased this. Works perfectly. Very Happy.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Stunning visuals.  Love how the educational piece is interwoven in to the game!  Makes it great for all ages.  Plenty of motivation to keep playing throughout the game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the romance between Eva and Gideon. This book was very good. Sylvia please don't take to long with pt 4. I need to now what is gonna happen next.
B009CGR416|5.0|This movie mimics the world inside my head somewhat. Set up like life in a video game and with music to boot. Just done well.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Who doesn't love &#34;Forrest Gump&#34;???? LOL My son looked for it and had us look for it out in town for quite a while....no luck:-(  Finally, just ordered it here! He's happy:-) Thanks and God bless.
0984999302|5.0|It`s a great book for startup business owners when they facing everyday decision.<br /><br />Lean startup no doubt is a cure in modern days for the waste of resource due to the waterfall developing process. It is a guideline which let startup owners knowing where their business are and how to iterate their hypothesis.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Anyone who has joined Pinterest knows that you can get lost in it for hooooouuurs!!!! It's got so much cool information in it, though.I love it. Just wish that I had all the time in the world to investigate everything! LOL Thanks and God bless.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|One of the best kindle rpgs I have ever experienced in my life!!!!<br />I have not seen a better rpg than this go for kindle fire!!<br />Gameloft did a wonderful job making this, monsters are not to hard to defeat. I encourage you all to download this. I enjoyed it and so will you!
B00881VLCE|3.0|Not really my cup of tea; more into brain teasers and word games:-) I believe I deleted it. Thanks and God bless.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|I used akinator on the browser and I liked it, it amazed me, and when I saw this app I didn't read the description or any reviews because I thought I knew what I was getting. After pressing download I read some reviews and I realized all the bad things about this app. When the download completed I tried to delete it bt nothing happened. I'm continuously pressing delete and its not working.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I have been using Cosair H-70. Temp was around 28-32...<br />I do not to use liquide cooler anymore. Because, I read article about leackage of the cooler.<br />I just shocked after I replaced the cooler. CPU Temp is same as H70. Even Case Temp is lower than before...<br />I am really happy with this product.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|I ordered 1 dvd life of pi I received 1 dvd you double charged me..first you charged me 26.90 for the pliers and the 1 dvd...then you charged me again 12.99 for the dvd life of pi...I have contacted you a number of time and with no response from amazon and I am requesting that you do something about it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it, can't wait till the next one!!!!! I love way he loves her so much he can't live without her.
044024630X|4.0|Kept my interest all through the book.  I did not want to put it down.  Exciting, riveting, story was believable
B002N44XSG|5.0|This is a great book for kids or anyone looking for short entertaining stories. I've read all of the Percy Jackson books and this book much like the others doesn't disappoint.
0515153656|4.0|Kept my interest all through the book.  I did not want to put it down.  Exciting, riveting, story was believable.
B008J34466|4.0|Love Pink, love her songs but unfortunately didn't pay attention and bought the<br />explicit version would have prefered the cleaned up version.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game.It was just what I've been looking for a challenging game that makes you think.I enjoyed the graphics as well and I had no problems with glitches or download or anything on my kindle fire hd. I would have given it five stars if it were a little longer, but overall I'd give it 4.5stars.I look forward to more games like this from fireproof games, I can't wait. It definitely took me a little longer by not using hints like another reviewer suggested. A few times it had me stumped but when I finally figured out what it was that I hadn't tried I was like &#34;duh why didn't I try that before?&#34; But it only added to my enjoyment and I didn't find anything that was impossible to get. Thank you for finally making a challenging game that will keep adults on their toes and coming back for more.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|Great music did not realize this was and explicit version would have bought the cleaned up<br />version .  I would recommend this only to adults I do not play it when my grandchildren<br />are around.  Suprisingly all the songs are good some are great.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|this app is SO fun and SO addicting! i LOVE the little pudding monsters monsters!!! definitely consider buying this game!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|We love this series, and we look forward to Season 2. The storyline and characters are great and engaging. A fun ride through history. Give me more! KPR
1475143389|5.0|This is short and sweet-I would not say the book is for newbie's. I think there are much better beginners programs out there (bodybuilding.com) is one source. I will say anyone wanting good solid information on how to change this is an outstanding book (sold on Audible.com too). If you don't like want you see in the mirror, than put this book in front of your eyes. All the best on building a body you proud of.
0060392584|5.0|A wonderful look into the early life of Marilyn Manson. I greatly enjoyed it, and highly recommend for any fan of his! :)
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This is a masterpiece of deluded thinking.  Psych majors want to figure out what is wrong with them should watch this movie.<br /><br />Dad is OCD and superstitious, making juju to help the Philadelphia Eagles win.  Apparently the defective gene has passed from father to son, as Dad is banned from Eagles' stadium for some sort of unnamed violence.  In the same way the son has a restraining order against, well, everyone, including his wife.<br /><br />Mom tries to follow what she believes a proper wife should do, but it's futile.  She's overwhelmed by trying to fulfill her wifely duties while bailing out her son who has been in a mental institution for 8 months.  Turns out he's bipolar.  She copes as best as she can.  She's probably the only sane one in the movie.<br /><br />The son's deluded thinking is that he can make amends with his ex-wife and they will be all cozy again.  Ain't gonna happen.<br /><br />He meets a young widow whose impossible dream is to win a dance contest.<br /><br />Love happens.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great for devotions and to carry on a device.  I would recommend it to anyone!  And it's free!
0345494768|5.0|An excellent telling on how one of the most influential movies was made. The pictures are beautiful. Recommend it for a Stars Wars or just a movie history fan!
0380807343|5.0|Neil Gaiman never fails to disappoint!  This book is better than the movie in a lot of ways.  If you've seen the movie I suggest you read the book as well.
B008BIZBIY|4.0|This is a good drive. The only thing is I hate installing Nero software! It takes almost 12 hours to install!  OMG!  I did it in 6 hours the first time and had to do it again for another computer but it failed so I had to install it again. I would recommend NOT to install Nero as it just takes to long. removed one star for that, it's not the drives fault, the drive is fine.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Great show, it was just getting good with the stories. An s show that was postive. And not a show about police or game shows/realatied shows..jusy to many these days.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It can not be beat is Stevie the only one add Skydoseminecraft or Herobrine that is when you will have better things
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I didn't think it was possible to love Gideon more than I already do, but I was certainly wrong!!! It felt like I waited FOREVER for this book to come out but once I read it, I realized that it was worth the wait! I loved watching Gideon and Eva find their way back to each other. It warmed my heart to see Gideon doing his very best to open up and share things with her. He's truly a beautiful sole (broken) but beautiful at the same time.<br /><br />I will say however, that I can see what all the negative reviews are about. I completely believe that some of the \\"filler\\" stories could have been cut out, all the little loose ends could have been tied up and the book could have then been wrapped up in a pretty \\"Trilogy\\" bow. Why there's going to be another book, possibly 2 seems a little stretched to me but then again you won't see me complaining as I continue to read Gideon and Eva's story. I don't think Syliva is stretching it out for the $$$, I believe she's got more to share with us and I'm more than okay with that.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I read these books because my kids talked about them all the time.  I'm really really glad thy dis. Wonderful series. Good job.  Great read for all ages!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I love this book!  It is written in the first person and gives a wonderful insight in to the world of the patient who is experiencing Alzheimer's-related symptoms.  It helped me to be more patient with my father, as his symptoms progressed.  Many thanks to the author: Lisa Genova!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a really fun way to enjoy game time with family and friends in other parts of our world as well as local family and friends.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this book.  It was very detailed and vivid also the facts that are printed are backed up by sources.  This book not only took you back in time with important historical points in our countries future but did so while entertaining me.  I wish there was a part two with more presidents I would surely purchase it.
B004W1GD4A|5.0|You won't be wasting your time watching this one...also a fan of Call the Midwife and Downton Abbey. I tried watching the first series from the 70's but it is rather difficult to watch after this spectacular quality!
B00068TJM6|5.0|I am very happy with this watch. I had the gold one of theese for over twenty years adn thought a silver or stainless steel model would be nice as an everyday model. I am very happy with this watch.
1591396190|5.0|Awesome book on how to think different and establish a new market approach in the market you are in.<br />This can even be done in saturated markets with commodity goods.<br />Very interesting for anyone who sells products and services.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|The last stand is a movie where the leader of a drug cartel busts out of a courthouse and speeds to the Mexican border, where the only thing in his path is a sheriff (Arnold) and his inexperienced staff.<br /><br />The movie starts out pretty slow and the cast of characters are a bit out there, but this movie is reminiscent of an 80's Arnold action flick.  It is not the best action film out there and the action at times is a bit over the top but the action does pick up in the second half and at least keeps you occupied for the duration.  The action is a bit over the top and you have to suspend your belief in reality at times but if you like the 80's style action movies, then this will be for you.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|This was purchased as a granddaughter yard toy and made a big hit.  My daughter posted a picture of granddaughter in it on Facebook and received lots of positive comments.  Less expensive than the other one we looked at, it is also simpler to set-up WITH AN AIR COMPRESSOR.  Very pleased.  The toys included were also well received, and I think we will enjoy this even more as the summer progresses.  [Does need to be dumped after every day it is used and refilled with fresh water for the next use.  Definitely not something you want to do in drought area.]
B008AK8FHM|4.0|If you have lost someone or just have an interest in the afterlife, this was a good read.  I found the medical insight to be the most different thing compared to other books written about N.D.E's. Each person will come away with a different opinion based on his or her beliefs. I found it to be reassuring.
B00CATSONE|4.0|i never even knew about nikola tesla.  now i have total admiration for the man. i think everyone should read this.
0679809015|5.0|My six month old went out shopping with his aunt and came home with this book.  I can't tell you why, but he has been obsessed with it ever since.  He is a very active little boy and won't sit still to read any book but this one.  Its his pre-nap, time to calm down, go to book; he will actually dig it out of his toys and bring it to me.  We read it every day, and he is always very interested.  Now that he's a little older (9 months) he likes to open the flaps and turn the pages by himself.  He loves the puppy dog in the dog house!  Its starting to look a little worn around the edges, but its pretty durable overall.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. This game would teach you how to have a house. I would want people to use this game.
1780721676|5.0|Highly recommend, easy to read, well written, carry it around with me.  You will like it.  Buy it now folks
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I use this for work and program the buttons for common uses for Excel and so on. I love that I can customize this with everything i normally do on my keyboard with out having to stretch my fingers for copy and pasting 400 time. the weight and size are perfect for my hand and would recommend this product to anyone. the only drawback is it is not cordless.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great book in the Samurai or Old West tradition.  It's smooth and clear.  It is what it is.  Good guys and really BAD guys.  And the good guys always win.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|It was an entertaining action movie that was worth the rental.  It was good quality streaming from Amazon Prime through the Xbox
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|this was a gift for a family member, but they loved it and have some of his music already so it will get played alot
1443410675|5.0|I would say it's kind of a Message of Hope for dummies...really easy to read and understand, with example that you can actually see yourself in..! If you know you need to change your way in life...but don't know where or how to start...THAT is the book for you!!
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|guess I expected something different , was into more of the old timberlake from bake a few years, but its doable
B009NY43NY|4.0|Another great Skokie stack house novel. So sad that this is the end though glad that things tied up the way I expected!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This game is crazy. It has guessed my thoughts every time. It's just to good. This game is awesome. Highly recommended.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|the grow your kingdom part is so similar to farmville,  so it was quite easy for me to learn. the only thing bad I see is with all the little people moving around your kingdom it gets visually cluttered after a while. other than that its great for being a free game!
0062059963|5.0|The Elite was even better than The Selection. It took me a while to get into it because I was just annoyed that there was a second book. I mean don't get me wrong, I loved both of these books, but I really think she could of easily made it one big book instead of three. But The Elite was really good, and if you read The Selection you should continue. There was a little more action, more dresses, more of the annoying Aspen, and A LOT MORE Maxon (which is a wonderful thing). It was a great sequel and I can't wait for the next one.<br /><br />America! Will you make up your mind! Seriously! She is so annoying. It is obvious that Maxon loves her, and she is pushing him away. Ahhh!!! America, Stop it! Maxon is so sweet. Also Aspen...he needs to go! That's all I'm going to say about that. Maxon got better in this book. He grew up more and defended himself and I love him even more. There is a party and more of America's family which I love.There is a lot more action. The rebellions are better. Celeste is even more evil. And can I just say I hate Maxon's dad! ahh! Go away will you.<br /><br />Okay, that review is not a great reflection of The Elite. The Elite was really good, and I cannot wait for The One.-http://readerwithvoice.blogspot.com/
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Quell Memento is a treat for both the eyes and ears. If you love puzzles but hate timers, this game is perfect for you. The relaxed feel of the game allows you to think things through without feeling pressured to hurry. A true delight!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|TO START WITH IT IS WAY TOO HARD TO CONTROL THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HUNGRY SHARK USING THE TOUCH OR TILLET CONTROLS
B0035WTE2U|3.0|One, or two songs, were in the movie.<br />I understand the premises, behind the CD, but it could have been done better.
B003M6FGTE|4.0|I find that the longer this program is on the air the more I enjoy it.  I really like the fact that most of the songs relate to the story line.
B001EN71HC|5.0|I love the Austin Powers movies.  I enjoyed all of the special features on the BD version because i had had them on VHS before.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Been playing this for sometime using the ad supported version on Google Play and so was a tish bit concerned that getting this HD version from Amazon would require me to restart the game from the beginning.<br /><br />Nope - quote the opposite in fact. The moment I fired it up it asked me if I wanted to load up the game progress from the other version and I was away!<br /><br />Most excellent. Puddings advance! The world is yours!
030014332X|5.0|I, as a history major, really enjoyed this book because I learned so much that I did not already know.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Love Il Divo - Amazon makes it so easy to shop.  Everything is written concise.  I can listen to selections from the CD before making the purchase.  Never an option in a storefront.
B0057O6IDW|2.0|I didn't care for this movie.  I thought it would have been better than what it was.  I could have done better.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Honestly, this whole series (but especially Old Man's War) competes with Terry Pratchett's Watch series for top honors in my personal collection.  Old Man's War starts out so innocuously and mysteriously, and then dives right in to a creative take on retirement.  The story was good enough that an unbeliever at work read it, and then bought The Ghost Brigades and Last Colony.<br /><br />This may SEEM like typical military fiction based on the cover and other descriptions, but it's really not.  I find that genre to be so dry and dull most of the time, whereas this story is engaging and personal.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of sci-fi.
B0051CSI0G|4.0|It was not as good as my expectations but it was a decent movie to watch.  I would have rather rented it.
B00BVVA138|5.0|I wasn't upset when Howard took over for Jesse, and I'm not upset with the reversal.  I'd advise any KSE and Times of Grace fans to pick this one up and give it a listen.  There are some really awesome tracks on here, and a couple of just so-so tracks.  And once again, the live tracks are excellent.
B005J4TLQG|5.0|I did not know what to expect from this movie but it far exceeded my expectations and I recommend this to anyone looking for a good laugh
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I'm looping this song all day on my phone. it's so catchy and upbeat. I love the bass beat. i sing every time the radio plays it.
B008X8RSTM|1.0|I thought this was too confusing and too hard to use.It didn't give enough options.I don't recommend this map system
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I love the weather channel but for some reason this app does not work here.  I will keep it in case I move in the future.
B005GRF2UK|5.0|For certain pieces of work it takes time for me to love them. One for me was Pride and Prejudice, when I first read it, it was my least favorite of Jane Austin's novels-- and after re-reading it (along with all her other works) it is now my favorite. Jane Eyre also grew on me over the years. As I aged I gained an appreciation for the emotion and depth of the story, all the turns and pitfalls, the love for the characters. And who doesn't love a happy ending?<br /><br />So as I've perused through the many different film adaptations I've always felt something wanting. They never really captured the raw emotion of the book as well as the 2011 Focus Feature's version I watched tonight. I loved the way the story transitioned and the actors who played the parts. Of course seeing Judi Dench in any movie also tells you it's worth your time lol.<br /><br />This is the first film adaptation of the book I'm buying (rented it this weekend)-- gotta love amazon deals!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|From the first book, through all of the lives, across continents, this has been an adventure I never want to end. I have loved and cried, laughed and been enraged.  Many of my hopes and dreams for some of these people come true. I identified, in my own mind, the connection and secrets of certain characters. I have never been disappointed.  I just hope this adventure continues.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A very interesting approach to writing about the Hitler years.  Initially I had difficulty getting into it but then I couldn't put it down.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|This is a ripoff by Disney and is nothing but pure greed,I always watch the move the first time in 3D On my set and then later on I rewatch it again in 2D because no one like wearing the 3D glasses all the time So i will just rent and not buy again untill they stat to put all the discs togeather again.
B009GX69RK|5.0|I just love this show. It reminds me of the quick, quirky humor of &#34;Scrubs&#34;. Just a smart show with funny, engaging characters.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is an enjoyable app with many different levels. I have found some levels great for just passing the time and other levels that offer a real challenge. Fun for all ages and skill levels. I highly recommend it.
B007FIY3VW|2.0|Works spotty. And it will not sign in to Dropbox cloud, Google drive will work. Hope they fix this, will keep trying occasionally.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|WHILE OFTEN ABRASIVE, ECCENTRIC, AND OVERALL DIFFICULT TO ABIDE,  Steve Jobs had a vision which was simple and pure.  His methods often angered the people that he hired, but he also got them to surpass even their own vision and capabilities. His impact on the computer world is astounding; his impact on the communicating world is breathless; his impact on how the everyday human in society is often unknown and unappreciated - - but still HUGE.  Steve wasn't sure if there is a GOD and or an afterlife, but if HE does exist and there is an afterlife, then I feel certain that GOD is quite pleased with all facets of Steve Jobs.  It is a &#34;Good Read&#34;, and I am glad that my wife got me to read it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is addicting and very enjoyable.  I noticed that the characters' clothes never seem to change in 7 years, otherwise very realistic!
B003PVPXOE|5.0|Gloria Swanson is excellent as Norma Desmond.....loved this movie for many years and wanted a needed a copy for myself.
B004927I50|5.0|This is a great cd. I love listening to it and I was highly recommend it to people of all ages.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I reluctantly downloaded this app as the FAotD, but I was convinced that it wouldn't do anything for me. Much to my delight and surprise, the combination of thunder and faucet is just the thing I need to drift to sleep in under ten minutes. It seems to be easy on the battery, especially with the timer function that will shut the app down automatically. LOVE this app.
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|This cd is absolutely one of the best CDs ive ever heard. I would recommend it to anyone any age.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Good book. Read it when the movie came out. Heard many good things about the book and I was not disappointed.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|My first run I complete in about 3.5 hours. Love matching the tiles with the RPG-esque style. Keeps you playing while you upgrade your weapons, armor, shield, etc. I would definitely pay $1 for this game although I got it for free as the free app of the day on the Amazon App Store. If you like games like Puzzle Quest, Zoobattle, Bejeweled, check this title out! You can't go wrong.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I very much enjoyed watching Hunger Games through Amazon but I'm glad I read the book first. Otherwise I couldn't have followed it as well, especially at the beginning. It's a great \\"escape from reality
B00992CF6W|5.0|My brother downloaded this and I'm a girl so I thought that I wouldn't like it... boy I was wrong this is the best app ever buy it know.... go.. right know
1444723537|5.0|I love Stephen King & his alter ego Richard Bachman so this collection was great. Unfortunately, when I followed the link from Yahoo to Amazon I was told this book contained the story \\"Rage\\" (which is out of print and next to impossible to find). The book cover even looked different. I don't know whose fault it was, mine, Yahoo's or Amazon's but I didn't exactly get what I wanted. Given that I have read all these stories, have many of them in single books, and have the same collection on kindle and only bought the book for \\"Rage\\" I was disappointed to say the least. That said, this book is still amazing even without \\"Rage\\" 5 stars!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just the best. I love how it is on world tore it gives the game an raven better game I guess. I love it I love it I love it, you get so good I never get off it. I hope it goes to Eygipt.
0761169253|5.0|I think a lot of artist are filled with self-doubt. This book was really helpful on putting things in perspective. It's a quick and easy read, doesn't bog you down and every page hits the nail on the head.
1469220725|5.0|Looking forward to book 4&5  your writing is amazing and Gideon is perfection I know you will not disappoint in the other books
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I can see why people were frustrated with the book. I had low expectations when I started because of the many unsatisfactory reviews. However, I am glad I read it and I actually liked the book.<br />The last 2 books we saw Gideon and Eva's sex life but not much of a relationship. This book focused more on the building of that relationship. It was nice to see Eva staying with Gideon even when she was jealous or afraid after one of Gideon's nightmares. She matured a lot in this book.<br />The issue with Gideon's nightmares and the fact that they still can't sleep together still needs to be resolved and the 4th book hopefully will give them the whole HEA package. I can't imagine what the author is going for with Book 5.<br />Overall, it was a good read and I enjoyed the surprise towards the end (not saying)and made me smile.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is truly one of those \\"just one more go\\" type of games. Its 4.20am and im sat up in bed playing it while my partner is snoring besides me lol expect dark circles under your eyes with this game! Brilliant
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I enjoyed Cut The Rope and new zeptolab  has created another classic! Love the animation and puzzle innovative design!<br /><br />It's kind of like the game color the Blob
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Dungeon hunter four is a great game. Very good controls. Great graphics and story. Finally a game that puts a HD tablet into use.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|This is a decent mahjong game. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to play the game. Good game. A+++++++++++++
B008KMHFJY|4.0|Thouroughly enjoyed this book us girls always like a bad boy with a good heart underneath definetly worth a read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you have creative and survival in it and mobs that kill you some times.IT IS THE COOLEST GAME EVER!<br />GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It wasnt what I expected..IT WAS SO MUCH BETTER! i was on the edge of my seat. theres no doubt about it of how much they love each other. I mean lets be real they had to still act like they was not an item for the press. Gideon did what he haf to do and so did eva. Eva didnt sleep or lead Brett on same with Gideon and that aweful lady who tried everything to get bck with him.they showed how much they grew to trust each other yes there wad a litle of jealousy but who doesnt get jealous and yes you mite find someone who ur noy sleeping with attractive bt that doesnt mean you lobe the person ur with any less..duh I loved how the story is written I love that they become stronger for on another .the story shows that no mattrr what love will always be there and have a stronger bound than anything else  .everyone has their own opinions and wow the book blew me away honeslty I can't wait til the fourth one comes out I just hope it doesnt take a full year!! G&E is such an amazing, STRONG and COURAGEOUS couple omg and the cute little ceremony!! Deanna needs to hurry up and go away..lol I gotta hand it to Sylvia Day you sure do know how to keep us wanting more!! I'm not sure wat all to say without being a spoiler but I LOVE THE BOOK!!!!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I was happy to receive my items in time for Father's Day. My husband will love a new movie to watch.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I'm a tough audience and was thoroughly surprised at how good this record is.  I think the Rolling Stone reviewer described it best: \\"Somewhere in the orbit between Pink Floyd and Earth, Wind, and Fire.\\"
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I downloaded this app thinking it would be really fun. I loved it for about a month then it just got boring. Don't believe me waste your time and see for yourself.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Quirky anthropomorphic pudding people puzzle play on tabletop. Works well on S3. Not something I would buy (paid for Wordfeud and Ticket to Ride, for example), but this free app of the day is a fun, brief diversion and adds to my feeling that ZeptoLab makes games skillfully.
B00C49H3WI|5.0|Superb. Enough said. For a first time show, the acting is great with an amazing storyline.<br /><br />Pros:<br />.Characters<br />.Dialogue<br />.Story<br />.Setting<br />.Clone personalities<br />.lots of possibilities (story and character-wise)<br /><br />Cons:<br />.\\"cheesy\\" (it's good and ok at times)<br />.the main storyline can only go so far.<br /><br />EVERY episode is better than the next. It's a fast paced show for those who like action thrillers, yet slows and highlights certain scenes that help the audience connect with the plot and the characters.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is a bittersweet ending to the trilogy. The action is continuous and keeps you guessing. The characters draw you in for the most part, although some seem a bit shallow and contrived. I recommend the whole series and you must start at the begging to truly catch the fire.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this game although my freind got an update on itouch why hasn't it updated on here?i have it on xbox and pc i love love love it!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I wanted so badly to enjoy this movie. I was hoping they'd maintain the pattern of great one - lousy one - great one. The attempt to \\"reunite\\" John with his son came in the form of celebrating killing and destruction. The choices the characters made were ludicrous beyond any fathoming, much different than action film destruction suspension of disbelief.<br />The worst part was being asked to make the same agreement as in the fourth movie, to accept McClain as a serious action hero versus a dumb guy caught in bad situation hero. The best DH films were humorous; this was like being asked to watch James Bond in a romantic comedy or a John Wayne character in a Moulin Rouge style film. What a waste of resources this film was. I am saddened to say I hope they stop here....
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Fun game. I especially like the fact that you can use the bonus stars to pick the extra bonus action for yourself.
B002LE8D2K|5.0|I have a Dell Inspiron 560 that came with 4GB RAM and wanted to max it out to 8GB of quality gaming-level RAM. It was a nightmare wading through Dell's tech support to finally get all the info I needed to select the correct Corsair memory that I could easily afford, so I wanted to write this review for all Inspiron 560 owners: this is the RAM you need! You will need a bigger power supply to run this, especially if you intend to get a video card. I bought the Corsair CX500 500W power supply with this, and couldn't be happier with the results! (See my review of the CX500 for install tip you'll need to know).
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This was a very funny movie that the whole family is able to sit together and enjoy. Adult humor is disguised enough to allow our young children to watch too.
B008MM9630|5.0|so far I am enjoying this game .The graphics. are cute . The quest are fine so far.so far so good.
B004UPANAI|5.0|Totally kick ass X-men movie with one of the all time most famous characters, Wolverine. Good to get the story of how he came about.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|I am on the phone with you guys now for over one hour and still did not get the problem fixed. You guys say that I can have the eBay app on my kindle, but Amazon does not support it, what crap is that. You lure people in with all the apps and then I can not  use them to there full potential. and just know the guy says he can't fix the problem but will transfer the problem to some other people who will send me an email some time next week or even later. Great Customer support. All I want is to get Notifications for my eBay app. But I guess that's to much to ask. If they can not fix the problem, I will return this kindle fire, very disappointed right now
B00004UEDQ|5.0|Funny, and real life as I worked in a Detox unit and many treatment facilities, this stuff actually happens in treatment. Kid love this film!
B002VECMAE|5.0|Just get it and see for yourself how wonderful a film can be... Based on the true story of what our military actually does - if you liked MASH. you'll love this!
B001HVZO9S|5.0|Retured this movie, and was disapointed that our system could not show it due to blueray, hope to get one that is not!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I could not put this book down!  Great summer light reading. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|You can love this movie for the beautiful photography, the poignant plot, the masterful acting, the depth of the characters, the soundtrack that became a classic. I myself loved it for all of the above: it is one of the best movies I have watched in a long time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game that is fun for my family. it a clean game. I forgave to worry what my kids may be exposed to while playing
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|A great story and I enjoyed the continued angst of Eva and Gideon. However, there is too long a lag time between books and I feel manipulated. These books were marketed as a trilogy. I don't care how many more there are just get them out sooner. And don't lie about how the story will progress.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One never knows how a follow up season will be, but there is no question.  This series is around to stay.
1616550414|5.0|The book was absolutely perfect. It was better than I imagined. I definitely will recommend to all of my family and friends! I would purchase from this seller again.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another Amazing story! I love Gideon and Eva, what a dynamic couple. Their love is all passion and raw emotion, I can't get enough!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Definitely not as good as the first two. The story line had no substance to it. A definite waste of money. Rent it from your local library if you want to read it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I do not ride roller coasters, but I was on one with this story.  I understood the father's point of view and the mother's and felt empathy for both.  I was constantly in a 'did he or did he not' do it mode.  And the ending.........well, I definitely did not see that coming!  I recommend this book.  My first read of the author, William Landay.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|A little difficult to hold and read in bed. The edges cut into you hand.<br />Have never used the stand-up feature.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A delightful story, well crafted and paced. The  characters are interesting and the setting delightful.  I love the language and this version is complete and lovely!
0920236162|5.0|I teach a unit on Fairy Tales and love stories with a twist, along with a better lesson! My students, girls and boys, loved this book.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Awesome. Gave to a friend as a birthday gift. They loved it. Even if you don't care for the 4th movie it's awesome.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This CD has all the best of his older music. I love having them all on one CD.  It gets me moving
0194325385|5.0|I teach adult learners in an ESL setting. This book has helped my students many times. The book's condition was excellent and the price was great.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|That will get you moving.  It was a great movie too..  And I loved both.  Would like to see the movie again
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|i BOUGHT A NEW KINDLE FIRE BUT IMMEDIATELY LOST THE CABLE. RATHER THAN WASTE TIME LOOKING FOR IT, I JUST ORDERED A NEW ONE. IT'S IN PERFECT CONDITION, THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT AND IT ARRIVED QUICKLY. GOOD PURCHASE
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The continuation of Eva and Gideon's love story made this reader very happy. I enjoy Sylvia's writing and most especially this series. I read to escape and relax. I did both with this book. If you liked the first two, you will definitely enjoy this one too. Not sure why anyone wants to complain about EWY not being the final book or that there was too much sex...this made me lol. I got what I expected and thoroughly enjoyed it. Looking forward to the next two!
B005KDDUVS|5.0|I really cannot emphasize enough how wonderful this book is. If you speak Spanish, by all means, get the version in Spanish. I haven't read the English translation, and while I'm sure it's wonderful, I'm glad I waited until my Spanish was at a level to where I was able to read the original. One of my professors during my semester abroad in Spain recommended this book highly to me years ago and when I finally sent the sample chapter to my Kindle a few months ago, I was hooked from the first line. \\"Todav&iacute;a recuerdo aquel amanecer en que mi padre me llev&oacute; por primera vez a visitar el Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados.\\" (I still remember that morning in which my father took me for the first time to visit the Cemetery of Forgotten Books)<br /><br />The wonderful thing about La sombra del viento is that not only does the plot keep you on the edge of your seat, and not only do the characters come alive, and not only is it beautifully written, but there are some amazing lines in the book that are just so insightful, and when I finished, as the main character says of the titular book in the first few pages of the novel, \\"No quer&iacute;a perder el hechizo de la historia ni todav&iacute;a decir adi&oacute;s a sus personajes.\\" (I didn't want to lose the enchantment of the story, or say goodbye to its characters yet.)<br /><br />This is easily the best book I've ever read in Spanish, and probably one of the top five best books I've ever read period. I can't wait to read the sequel.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Cute game with nice graphics and designs. Puzzles make you think and stimulate the brain. Great way to gave fun while developing the mind.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|You only get 15 minutes to play  and the  game is just a remake of Minecraft  the graphics are not the best but you could  still get use to it
1936608898|4.0|Their comments about &#34;engineered food&#34; caused me to think about why  potato chips etc and  why other engineered foods taste so darn good.  I have started avoiding milk products (not entirely though because I LOVE the taste of milk) and use more coconut based items (coconut based ice cream, coconut milk, coconut water).  I have found that my arthritis has improved significantly since I've avoided drinking as much milk as I used to.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If I have to wait another 8 months for her books I will never read anything else from this author. I screamed out loud....when I got to the last page!!! It was a great book just like the others in this series....I love the relationship between Ava and Guideon....
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|First impression:  This version strays too far from the look-and-feel of Quell and Quell Reflect.  I don't like the new menus as much.  I think the glowy hi-tech tiles are completely out-of-character from the previous versions.  I am TIRED of the sad, romantic piano piece that gets recycled here on level 2 (with all due respect for the composer, it needs new music). I find the man's voice distracting, and just too loud.  Also, having to dust off images so I can progress loses its appeal REAL fast.<br /><br />I loved the first two versions of the game, and will continue with this one because I've gone through the others twice, and there's nothing like Quell...but I don't like it as much.  So far...<br /><br />UPDATE:  (After progressing to Level 4)  Okay, so it's growing on me.  Like the two Quells before it, it's highly addictive, for me anyway.  Although the look-and-feel has changed, as usual, the designers at Fallen Tree Games have produced a product that is remarkable in its detail and consistency.  I have also changed my mind about the new menus.  Although they are slightly more complex, that just reflects the game itself.  They are intuitive & easy to follow. I wouldn't have it any other way.<br /><br />Other than THAT, the previous criticisms still apply.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very good game that I can play with my son. I also like to access the game on my phone.
B003EYVXTG|3.0|I bought this because of Jennifer Lawrence.... the producers should thank me for the purchase..... The story takes a LONG time to get to the point, and is a tad boring movie all the way through.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I really enjoyed this game, even with the simplicity of it. You play someone that wakes up in a dungeon that must slay monsters and level up weapons, skills, and armor to win the game. It is pretty satisfying the first play through to 10000000 points, though after that there is no motivation to keep playing as you have now won the game. If you play over, I suppose trying to improve how fast you got through the game or the amount of times you go through the &#34;Bejeweled&#34; style puzzle (which is the way you fight monsters) would be the main motivation for replay. Overall, it was fun the first time through but it really doesn't have staying power.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really liked this book.  I read all of the bad reviews and decided I would just check the book out at the library, but i received a gift card and changed my mind.  I am glad I did.  People who are moaning about the end should see that there is no way possible Sylvia Day could have ended the book any other way, unless she wanted to end the series for some reason.  I am looking forward to the next adventure of Eva and Gideon.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Love this album! I can't stop listening to it! JT is probably one of my favorite artists of all time.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This has to keep going,it can't possibly end  like this! The book is fabulous though and I can't wait to see what's coming up! I live this series
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is so helpful in letting you<br />know what's going on with the weather<br />You can ad  more than one location I have 4 and its so helpful.
B00992CF6W|3.0|i love the game but i wish the creators would make it availble to ALL!!!! devices like mine and the wonderful nexus 7 that my best friend has plz make it available to all devices... and give the pe breeding between animals and hurricanes
0762434279|2.0|Remember Rich Dad Poor Dad from youth. Thought time to introduce to my teen children but mini book is not the way to do it. My mistake ie thought full size book not 2'x2' abbreviated version
B00BEXB18M|5.0|excelent album!! i really enjoy more than 20 times listening this album and i really dont understand why some people give bad reviews..i think the metallica fans still think about rivality...please..understand metallica fans..MEGADETH ALWAYS IS GOING TO BE BETTER THAN METALLICA!!! ENJOY SUPERCOLLIDER! GREAT ALBUM I think the media and some paid journalists want to discredit this album ... possibly because dave politically is against many things about the current U.S. government .. want to hurt album sales .. but I hope people realize it's a good album and buy it!!
B007REV4T8|4.0|anther good movie in the bond film ear that never ends. James is back and with so many twists you may need to take notes.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Okay, let me start with cons: at first pictures showed when he guessed... then they stopped. Also the text isn't and never has been in the speech bubble for me. The pros: he can't be beat! Goku from dragonball z. Jason Brody from fat cry 3. Quasimodo. Princess kitana from mortal combat. Doesn't matter... he guessed it.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|just the right balance of action and suspense. overall a very nice movie to sit down and watch. I wanted to be a superhero all over again.
B000GG4XJM|4.0|Bruce calls for a whiskey drinking sound and he gets it.  He said that he watched his drinking in a television interview but its obvious on this DVD that he needs to do more than watch it.  There is a good time here for sure but I prefer the Sessions Band Live in Dublin DVD.  Also check out the Sessions Band show in St. Luke's on youtube. Great vibe.
B004GNFSO0|5.0|This is such a good read. Apparently there is some controversy about whether or not it is all true but it is an amazing story and I could not put it down.
B0028RXXFC|3.0|Lots of fighting, very graphic, lots of blood, there is nudity.  Not the best, it is ok. I would not purchase it again.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I really like this album, usually when you buy an album you will get maybe 3 songs that you like but with this cd I like mostly all the songs.
B003PIUC02|4.0|Lots of fighting, very graphic, there is nudity.  Did keep my interest. You can get into the story after you start watching it. You will need all the series or you will lose the plot.
B000009MF7|5.0|I am a shameless classical music snob/recording hoarder.  The second movement of the Concerto in G is one of the most beloved works of the twentieth century and deservedly so.  When I am shopping for recordings I am listening to hear the composer's intent, not the performer's (orchestra included).  There are rare exceptions to this (notably Glenn Gould) yet I immediately exclude the show performers (Bang-Bang, Juga Wang, Ageritch) and find myself attracted to the thinkers (Uchida, Pollini).  This recording is perfect - I would not change a thing.<br /><br />The recording itself is beautiful and spacious - clear and warm.  The orchestra is translucent when needed and forward when appropriate.  The 2nd movement is a masterpiece - so lonely, haunting.  The english horn chair is warm (not thin) - and lucked out with a reed.<br /><br />This trumps all recordings of the work - do not miss it.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|Lots of fighting, very graphic, there is nudity.  Did keep my interest. You can get into the story after you start watching it. You will need all the series or you will lose the plot.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|There's good reason to believe some of the more glowing reviews of this game are fake. The game is incredibly slow going unless you want to fork over extra cash to speed up arbitrary wait times. After you reach level 10 prices for goods and services become astronomical and you're practically forced to spend real money to see any progress at all. The biggest sin of all though is that the game is ultimately boring. A positive is that they have the likenesses of many of the actors from the films. It's too bad the game which serves as a non canonical sequel to the first two films turns these characters into absurd caricatures of their celluloid counterparts. All of them dole out nonsense business advice whilst sending you on expensive arbitrary busy work missions for little to no in game pay. Almost none of the dinos from the movies btw.
B001DWNUCO|2.0|Quality was not good.  It is labeled  blu ray but not high def., very grainy and nor clear at all. Lots of nudity.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I love this game! It has great graphics and fun levels with many challenging puzzles. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time-waster.
B004HW7JMY|4.0|Lots of fighting, very graphic, there is nudity.  Did keep my interest. You can get into the story after you start watching it. You will need all the series or you will lose the plot.
B000I8ES2A|4.0|The movie illustrates claims some scientists are making--we live in a hologram!  I love the way the story lead us with the many twists and turns.  If one wonders who we are, s/he will be bewildered after viewing this movie.<br /><br />P.H.
B0053ZAPDE|5.0|Ordered 2 pair, they arrived on time, everything included,  are comfortable, and seem to be made well. Would order these if I need more glasses.
B00C2IFMO2|5.0|Gave this as mother's day gift. Looong book but fasinating if you are history buff. Mom is really enjoyng. 2 thumbs up!!!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I knew it was adapted from a book into a movie, and I never read the book. I thoroughly enjoyed the twist and turns of this story. Just make sure you pay attention so you don't get confused. Same actors over six different time periods.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My son made me get this game. It starts out real easy and then gets more challenging. A real brain teaser.
B009AMANH4|3.0|I am a stringent political follower. This movie has a lot of politics in it. I believe this is the only reason I can give it a four star review. For people who do not like politics, this movie will be absolutely horrible. Very slow dialogue sequences and a lot of scenes meant for you to think. There is even a good fifteen minutes of \\"yay\\" or \\"nay\\". There is pretty good acting, so I understand the acclaim received for it. Good political movie, but please do not watch this movie if you are tired or drowsy.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Great way to kill time. not very challenging.I bought this to get GUI coins for another game. Otherwise I probably would not have tried it.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Ok the update came out on my phone great but the 7.0 update isn't on my kindle fire tablet help if some one got the update
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't tell you how much I love this book, it was well written and I can't wait to read more of Eva and Gideon story. This is they have grown together and have come together has a couple. There is a lot of different other things going on in book, I just wish they could catch a break with everything and have there happy ending. I just don't want yo wait 6 months to find out. I didn't like the ending it really wasn't a good ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Who is the new update on Kindle Fire? Reply A.S.P I heard it a cool update so reply A S P
B00C1BTWV4|5.0|What an awesome movie.  It was ground breaking at the time it was filmed.  It is still a great movie 20 years later.

193700788X|5.0|It's hard to say goodbye to Sookie, but I must say that I felt the ending of her story was appropriate.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. If you like card trading games you will love this. The graphics are great on my kindle fire hd. Definitely my favorite game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this author. Great book, amazing story plot.... be prepared to be engulfed in the story plot. Highly recommended reading the Eva and Gideon cross series.
B000VDDWE2|4.0|Those who love disaster movies will enjoy this flick, since it's about special effects and natural selection in action.  The subplots of the story are a little hoaky (we could have done without Dennis Quaid's wife staying behind with that cancer patient, and possibly the girl who got that infected cut), but in general it's a good time.  In times of disaster one has to stop living normally and survive on instincts left over from caveman times.  Although hard to imagine in this day and age, there are still a few hunter-gatherers in the world (such as the homeless man who joins the stranded in the New York library) who know how to survive when modern people seem to have forgotten it.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid plays a climatologist who has proposed that something odd is happening.  After a few shelves in Antartica have broken off due to global warming, he proposes that the Earth's climate is about to undergo a drastic change.  Lo and behold, a few days later, while his son Jake Gyllanhaul is in New York City for an academic challenge tournament, it starts to rain out of control.  While the streets are flooded, a motley crew of people retreat to a public library as a tital wave hits and they are stranded (with millions of others in the northern hemisphere) as a cold snap moves in.  Those who tried to get out to escape how deep the snow was going to get freeze to death, and those who found shelter are forced to wait for some kind of rescue.<br /><br />In a political twist, many find a reverse immigration takes place when suddenly people from the northern hemisphere are crossing the boarders into the southern hemisphere (aka third world countries) to escape the devistation of the north.  In Washington the lobbiests refuse to believe that this strange weather condition is going to cause such a problem until it's too late.  Then the President falls down and the skeptical Vice President is forced into leadership with the new conditions.  And here we are, forced to see a new world without so much as a chance to catch our breath.  A parallel to what we are facing today in the US and Europe as western / American dominance in the world is declining and we are creating a brave new world again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is fun creative and a good game that anyone can easily learn thanks for the fun guys. Keep it up!!:)
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Dexter just keeps getting better! I'm always surprised that they can still come up with more good plots and twists.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|My 4 year old cant get enough. It was easy for him to navigate and play. Games like this keep him occupied for hours.
B0063GORYU|5.0|My wife loves the game.  She told me that she was addicted.  It was easy to learn because it was designed with assistance during the early levels.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game it,s so cool. i just love to find the things hiding all over the room and finding the key s then going to the next room. SO AWESOME
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I love how Memento builds on the first two games.  Things are similar but enough different to keep your interest.  Music is great as always.  Finding the jewels is harder than I thought it would be.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think it is awesome... but I wish you would have buckets of water so you can make a pool. Anyway it's awesome because it has 2 games.LOVE IT!!!!!!!!
B00C5XBAOA|1.0|The age on this product is 3+, but it would really be better for a slightly older child.  My daughter is 2 1/2, but plays with MANY toys aged 3+ with no problems, but not these toys.  The heads pop off REALLY easy - my daughter popped one off within 30 seconds of getting this toy.  They are big enough to not be a choking hazard, but she has not popped the heads off any of her other dolls.  Also, because these are made to go with the sounds castle, they have to be able to make the castle do the sounds.  The problem is, they decided to do this by putting tiny feet on all the dolls except Miranda with colors on the bottom.  I am assuming this differentiates between what sounds should be made, but the tiny feet on large headed dolls make it nearly impossible to get them to stand.  And they don't even sit well due to the rubber \\"skirts\\" on the dolls (King Roland and Prince James have rubber tails on their coats, and Sophia and Amber have rubber ruffles at the top of their skirts).  Miranda doesn't bend at all due to her skirt (but she is easy to stand up for the same reason).  Overall, I wish these had an older age range to reflect these issues.  I thought about giving this 2 stars, but decided to do 3 because we did decide to keep them (mostly because my daughter LOVES Princess Sophia and would be upset if we took them away from her).<br /><br />UPDATE:  We have had this set for all of three days. The heads falling off has gotten so bad that we are considering hot glueing the heads on.  My mom picked up Amber and her head popped off for no reason!  If the trash man hadn't already hauled the box away, we would be returning this.  There are just too many issues.  I was so excited for Sophia toys as my daughter lover her, but I am just so disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Ok so it's like it is a puzzle but you have to fill in all the squares. Trust me it's awesome.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|This novel is both well-written and vastly entertaining. It keeps the reader interested, though does lag at times for many pages. A great fantasy read, especially for those who enjoy fiction but not typical fantasy and science-fiction.
0399165274|4.0|Forsyth got it right - again.  A strong anti-terror story set in the present with Col. Kit Carson as the hero.  Forsyth's basic idea seems borrowed and expanded from earlier unconnected terror killings and now our Boston murderers.  We are seeing (and Carson sees) unconnected individuals taken in by a well spoken, hate preaching imam who gets people to do targeted killings from which they may/will die.  Simply written with a nice background on Carson, followed by aclear logical step-by-step approach to problem solving leading to success.  Carson operates in the deep black.<br /><br />One of those murdered is a senator.  Carson's dad, a retired General in a Virginia Beach retirement community died in the hospital.  The job becomes personal revenge.  Who is this imam?  He must be stopped.  Carson uses all the tools and favors he can pull on this job.  Additionally, Mossad and its agents, both field and deep cover work with Carson - nearly world-wide and then deep into Somalia to make the kill.<br /><br />This novel twists and turns in true Forsyth style.  It is complex but very easy to follow - and enjoyable.  I hope any reader of this review excuses the lack of story plot details.  Don't want to mess up your fun.  The base outline and framework is enough enticement.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000002UVX|5.0|sounds even better after all these years. jimi and buddy really work well together. shold of done much more. great live
B004UID2LC|1.0|Was great for watching latest YouTube videos; however, now there is HUGE ad on top of video (in landscape mode) that interferes with the videos I am trying to view. HUGE FAIL!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|absolutely love these hidden object adventure games.  This game is one of my favorites...great graphics and good storyline...looking forward to many more of these games
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have loved this series from the very beginning. So much humor, good sex and intrigue. And of course there was Eric, who was a completely cardboard character in this final book and hardly heard from at all. It just felt like the author just wanted the series over and now it is. Very sad.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm not sure why there are so many angry people when it comes to this book. How can you possibly be mad about more Gideon? If possible, I love him more now than I did before. Thanks Sylvia! Xoxo This book was as fab as one and two. Can't wait for books four and five. :)
B002BBJ52U|4.0|Try's to show the many cultural conundrums and hyposcrisy of a generation lost in relationships and not knowing which way is up.  I feel for the characters and there struggles to find happiness at all cost and those who due to the price they are willing to pay for there happiness guanrantee they will not find it.  The ending is cute and warms the heart a bit.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After all the wait and release delay drama&#34; the storyline was weak, incomplete and just dull.  Not interested in waiting another 6 months or more to find the unorganized thoughts.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved the first two books in this series and even re-read them in anticipation of the new release. Although I still love the characters, it just felt like a lot of plot was rehashed from the first two books with little teases about things to come. I hope Ms. Day comes through in the next volume with a better plot and something more substantial than laying groundwork for the fourth installment. I'm sure I'll read the next, but I'm not looking forward to it nearly as much as I anticipated the arrival of Entwined.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I felt like some of the books were a bit long to get through. This one held your attention from start to finish.  I was extremely sad to hear about Robert Jordan.  He would have been proud of this last book in the series.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This was never released to our Midwest theater.  It was promoted in previews but I never saw it in the theaters.  It is a wonderful movie.  Some, may think, it is too sappy or predictable.  I don't think so.  It is heartwarming and uplifting.  Even my husband, who is NOT a foreigm film fan, loved it.<br />I would urge you to google this and read some of the articles regarding the real life people who inspired this movie.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|All 8 Harry Potter movies on DVD. No extras, but at least they have subtitles, which most collections don't have.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I love these characters and their story.  I anxiously waited for the release of this book, supposedly the final chapter, but I am disappointed.  I could have done without so many I love yous and pet names like Angel.  It went beyond being romantic and just got annoying.  I also was a bit turned off by the graphic wording to describe some intimate moments,  I don't remember the first two books being as graphic in the descriptions of genitalia.
B000062XGK|5.0|The Special Edition of The Abyss is like a total different movie. The cut version leaves a LOT out and you don't really get why the aliens are here. This version shows them as not being all cute and cuddly. They mean business. I say ONLY watch this version.
B000FCK65W|5.0|It was a heart warming beautiful story.  I also watched it on TV and told everyone how much I enjoyed both.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book was ok... I felt it left open to many unanswered questions for me. I waited 6 months for this book because the release date kept getting pushed back... Only to end it wondering wtf! Now how long do I have to wait to read two more? Honestly I will probably forget. If this is to drag out earnings and your waiting to release more in a year or maybe 2 you won't make much because everyone is disappointed. My recommendation get those books out within a couple months!
B0090KZDSK|1.0|This is the first review I have ever done but i couldn't stay quiet. I love contemporary romance novels and read way too many of them. I couldn't finish this book and asked for my first ever refund!  This book has no story line, repetitive sex scenes (of which there are lots) and from other reviews I have read this book leaves you hanging. Won't be spending another $20 to read book 4 and 5! Very disappointed:(
0788859544|4.0|This item arrived in great condition with no issues!  It doesn't play on one of my DVD players but it could be because its a refurbished DVD player not necessarily a problem with the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this on my phone and it is awesome.. but I bought it and it wont download!! Extremely<br /> disappointed.
B0036T1RMM|1.0|There is a great divide amongst those who have watched this film; The ones who LOVE it, and the ones who hate it. It is, indeed, a very polarizing film. The most difficult part of this is that if you happen to be a member of the latter party, the former will be sure to negate your opinion by calling you uncultured, stupid, dim, etc. I could list the art-films that I have watched and appreciated to try to dispel the attacks but I don't find that necessary- The attacks themselves are desperate pleas from people who want nothing more in life than to be viewed as \\"deep,\\" \\"intelligent,\\" \\"artsy,\\" and \\"cultured.\\" Liking this film does not make you any of those.<br /><br />I wish I could give you a synopsis of the \\"plot\\" in this film, unfortunately there isn't a plot and I would simply be rambling on for an undetermined, but assuredly lengthy, time about flat characters, insincere tradgedies, and coincidence with no real connection. It woud be a very accurate portrayal of the movie, but none of this would make sense to you and it still wont when/if you watch the film. Simply put, this movie is the most pretentious, boring, and pseudo intellectual movie I have ever seen. It does not have any kind of followable plot, no resolution, and the symbolism (such as 82, the biblical reference and the *surprise at the end*) are so terribly integrated into the movie that they fail at being clever and negate their own purpose by doing so.<br /><br />I wish I could say that the movie had at least a good point or message, a good critique on human nature that was perhaps just presented wrong. NO. The message, if you can find one, is simply that there are consequences for your actions but you can find forgiveness. It is a stretch, but you could say that the movie is about salvation. I would say that the film contradicts itself far too much to have a focused message.<br /><br />I came here to write this review, not because I am passionately angry, or upset about the good reviews- I came here earnestly hoping someone out there would read this review and choose not to waste 3 hours of their life absorbing this drivel. It was a terrible movie, even if watched as an \\"art-film.\\" I find damn near nothing redeemable in this crock and I sincerely hope you have the sense to avoid it at all costs- unless, of course, you want to watch it for the sake of saying you watched it, then scour the internet for the hidden meanings, the easter eggs, and what not; only to brag to anyone who will listen about how clever you found the whole thing.earnestly hoping someone out there would read this review and choose not to waste 3 hours of their life absorbing this drivel.

B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Daft Punk takes a lot of sounds from the 60's, 70's and early 80's and fuses it with their style making for a pretty awesome retro-modern album.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I know a bunch of people have said that there were too many characters and plot lines to keep track of but I didn't find that at all.  I loved every minute of this book and can't wait for the finale.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Seemed to go on and on but had interesting twist to it in the end...different for sure...would read more of her books.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|A very eye-opening documentary of America's food system; from growth and harvesting of crops, raising and slaughtering of animals, to the processing, packaging, marketing, and sales of what we know as food. It shows what hand the government and big business always in determining what &#34;good&#34; for the people...you be the judge!
B000VK7KVQ|4.0|Good film, and came across to me as kind of a documentary of a serial killer.  I know it's based on the truth, and was really glad my girlfriend suggested watching it one night.  Would definitely recommend :)
0316069434|5.0|This was yet another great read by MC!  He writes such wonderful books.  I love reading his stories and they always keep me in suspense.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book honestly took a while to finish. Count on dedicating some time to reading it. But you won't regret it. An interesting conspiracy theory meets time travel and its unintended consequences.
0399162097|5.0|Cannot-put-the-book-down plot. Characters so real their pulse became my pulse. Writing that drew me into its intricate web one shimmering strand at a time.<br /><br />A dazzling exploration using psychology, philosophy, and science to probe the shadowy workings of the brain, the nerve-triggered organism of family and, ultimately, the mysterious place that connects us all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would like it if u guys gave use more info in when it's coming out for the kindle fire hd please!!!! Also u guys made did very good on this app. Also please add me to your whitelist thanks
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Excellent fun music, great singers/ Loved the show. Billy Porter is fabulous. Would recommend the show and first time Broadway composer Cyndi Lauper's music
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have had this app for about two weeks and have really been enjoying it. It was a lifesaver while staying with my daughter for our family reunion. This wss so helpful when I needed to get back to sleep after being woken up by one of the five young grandchildren crying!:)
030789701X|5.0|This book has a lot of great content.  But I was expecting better quality , the binder is ok nothing great just kinda plain and not as heavy cover as i thought it would be they could of done a better job Graphically on the cover i think as well. for $35 its a pricey guide<br />but i would still highly recommend it if you are a die hard Skyrim fan
B009FZHYKU|4.0|streaming video a bit shaky sometimes<br />nothing that gets in the way of the story, but the glitchy movement does catch your eye and distract
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Recently went to Mt. Rushmore and had to see this movie again.  First saw it as a teenager in 1959 or 1960 at Radio City Music Hall in N.Y.  It's still great!
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I admit I wasn't a big fan of the second book. But I really liked this book. No ridiculously massive dramas happened, but it kept my interest the whole way through.I understand why some people are annoyed about this not being the final book, but for me, I'm stoked! I get more Gideon and Eva - and nothing could be wrong with that!! The wait for the next book is going to be frustrating as hell, but without a doubt as soon as it's released, I'll be getting it :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm a newbie when it comes to Downton Abbey but once I was introduced to the series, I've become captivated by the characters and storyline.
0345529057|5.0|I am about halfway through the first book and I LOVE it.  I haven't seen the HBO series but plan on checking it out *after* I finish this one.<br />I debated buying just the first one or the set but the set was only $10 for 3 more books, so I went with the set and I am glad i did.  I'm sure I will read them all.  But, I do love feudal fantasies.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I only spent about $2 for this item. Works great for my bathroom scale so far. Can beat the price.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was not as descriptive and volatile as people said. It was a great love story. And made me literally Laugh out loud. Can't wait to read the next one!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|The principle behind this book is excellent and eye opening and have implemented the diet immediately. The reading of it is extremely detailed and technical and is a bit laborious to the average reader like myself. I scanned several chapters . It is worth everyone in America reading.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This is simply a terrific film, with Bradley Cooper at his best, Jennifer Lawrence won an Oscar® for her performance, and legendary Robert de Niro as the father, among others in a very, very good cast.  The highly respected director David O. Russell has a son in real life with similar challenges as some of the leads, and you can watch for the son in brief scenes as a neighbor's youngster hoping to record events, documentary style, on his smart phone.  Russell's best known film before this was the award winning &#34;The Fighter&#34; which garnered Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director.  (Not bad!)<br /><br />We saw this again last night, very good Blu Ray print bought here on amazon.com, and liked it even better the second time!  The director's unusual film style and great dialogue help make this film what it is.  Anyone whose life has been affected by a dysfunctional family (whose hasn't?) or mental illness in any form would especially find this uplifting film touching.<br /><br />In special features, the film festival interviews with the actors and the people behind the camera are very revealing, and interesting, and especially fun for film buffs.<br /><br />You'll enjoy it!
B000FC1HBY|3.0|This book is in a series that was recommended. However I have not read them yet. I only purchased this #2 volume as Amazon said that it was one of the qualified books that I could download as a bonus for $1 dollar. However, when I downloaded it, it charged me full price so I am disappointed.
1439130833|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find this book is about 28 days of gratitude.  I'm so glad I bought this!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|NDE...experience fascinating!  Recommend to all.  Somewhat medically technical but most non-medical people should be able to follow sufficiently enough to understand.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|WTH?? Wasn't this supposed to be a trilogy?? Sylvia Day, I'm done buying your books. This ending sucked and you made me not like Eva anymore. Whatever, do yourself a favor, don't buy this book. Such greed.... sorry folks, I just feel ripped off.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have never written a review before but after reading all of the reviews on this book I now feel compelled to do so.. To start, I think the story line is developing just fine. Im glad that the extra characters are getting some story time now instead of in a spin off because I would never have read it. I am disappointed to know that I will have to wait only SD knows how long to continue the story, especially when it ended smack in the middle of drama... Unfortunately my love for Gideon and Eva will have me reading any books that continue their story but I am hoping it wont be too long before she releases the next one.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|App works great, very funny and you can customize the pictures.<br />Like, you can replace the picture of Superman with yourself, so your friends will see your picture as superman.<br />And, it guessed Daisy Marie right. What more can you ask for?
B007XNAQL0|5.0|This Blu-ray was purchased as a gift and the one who received it loved it!  He saw the concert years ago in standard definition and had been itching to see it again.  He said the video quality was great (played through PS3 and hi-def flat screen tv) and the sound on their surround sound system was excellent.  When purchasing this concert Blu-ray, keep in mind that the footage is old and technology can only do so much to 'upscale' footage shot in standard definition.  Despite that fact, this is worth purchasing in the higher quality (Blu-ray) format if you appreciate seeing things as sharply as possible.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|This is not a fancy display type collector set, but the Blu-ray discs work just fine and that is all that matters to me. This is a great value, I found a similar simple box set at a big box electronic store for $35 more. I use my PS3 as a Blu-ray player and when I enter these discs they are not labeled like normal movies. They just have some letters and numbers, but they play just fine. Also the first movie is titled as \\"The Philosopher's Stone\\" rather than \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\", but I believe it may have been known as the former in countries outside the U.S.
B0043URV5U|5.0|this is a great collection of the best of the old and new song's, from bob seger's long line of song's
B00000DHRX|5.0|This two-disc collection is one of my favorites and play it often. It is one of my favorite sets along with Devo's Anthology. All the songs are exceptional. The first disc has all the slow tempo songs and the second disc is a collection of his danceable tunes. This collection would be aptly titled, \\"Greatest Hits\\" and you would be very satisfied if you bought it under that title. They also include the remix versions of some of the songs. I also have George Michael's other albums and I find that all I need is to bring out this set and I get my George Michael fix. If you are looking for more beyond this to supplement this collection, you might do well to also get Wham! Final. This is his \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection during the days of Wham! I just love his vocals because they are very unpretentious and pleasant to listen to. I like to listen to the first disc when relaxing. And when I feel like moving to the beat I play the second disc. You can't go wrong with this collection.
B00AEFY5MK|5.0|Love this movie. I bought this to have an updated version of this movie. It Seems to be working fine.
B00133KFGW|5.0|5 stars for the story and the music. I saw it on TV and I had to buy for my collection
B00AEFY44Y|5.0|I love this movie and needed an updated version of this. Seems to be working great. No complaints here yet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is super fun and takes almost no skill. It's a great time passer if your bored. Hope you get it and enjoy it.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fun game to play....I like challenging myself to beat my own score.  I also compete with my boyfriend to see who can come up with a higher score.
B007HOOAH6|4.0|This book series is my two year olds favorite. This particular book gave him the idea to potty train. I couldn't have convinced him to try and train without it!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|My favorite thing about Facebook is keeping in touch with family as we all live in separate states.  It is a great way to share pictures whether old or new ones.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|The hobbit the beginning is the best. It goes to show that not all heroes are sword swishing Neanderthals but can be gentle folk put in extreme circumstances to be able to find their inner strength and hero. I hope the next one comes out and I hope all preteens and teens including us old coots to continue enjoying this journey. Have fun we did.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies, but the book is just amazing! Everyone should read it!! Definitely deserves 5 stars!
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|they worked out well. not as easy to hook them up to the wires but after about 2 of them i got the hang of it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I Love it. Cool game for my kindel fire hd. Kinda a long download but it's worth it. I Love long Rpg games with multi toons to play with. Diff class to choose from
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|I first came across this concept of dieting when I saw Dr Michael Mosley's TV program on a local channel (in Australia, by the way). I was intrigued by the different methods he used to (a) lose weight and (b) improve his health. I did try the method for a couple of weeks, but I suppose because I've been dieting for many, many years (too many!) it just didn't do it for me. My favourite method, although at present I'm having a bit of a struggle, is the Dukan Diet, on which I lost 20kg and have kept it off since 2010. My excuse at present is that it's winter in Australia, and one tends to want rib-sticker foods which aren't always good diet foods. Still, only a couple of months and it will be spring, and a whole new ball game.<br />Recommended for people who have will-power and a desire to lose weight and get healthy.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|We had seen all the Harry Potter movies one at a time and really liked them but when we received the set and could watch them  all in a row from start too finish and any time we want makes it really nice.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I absolutely loved this novella. It was intriguing, it was tightly written, it had a lot of features I liked as a science fiction/fantasy reader. It also had a hint of the Orient, although that could be my imagination, though I don't think so. Because of the short length, there is a great deal of character and development exposition in a very short time-frame, which really appealed to me.<br />I also liked the concept of being able to change one's environment by &#34;forging&#34; a new one. I'd like that skill!<br />Recommended for fantasy readers, although some science fiction readers might enjoy it as well.
B00CFQMVLS|1.0|I don't know if it me getting older or if movies are getting stupid - either way this movie was awful. The first ten minutes is all I could watch, luckily I had rented it and not bought it. Impossible scenes do not turn me on, I know the physics of wrecks, I know what can and can't be done - too much Mythbusters probably. The action was impossible, the vehicular stunts were impossible, the plot was stupid. I could go on for a long time about the awfulness of this film, but can't muster the enthusiasm to do so. The actors have gone down a long way in my eyes - they have make crap for money. I don't think I want to watch any more modern movies - they don't make sense, they don't look real, they don't do anything for me.
0345803485|5.0|This was requested for a friend's birthday.  i had already read it and loved the trilogy, so was happy to order a copy for her and one for me.  Still waiting for mine!
B00867GHS8|4.0|This is a great movie for the kids in your family and in my case I like it too. You can read the story line on Amazon and since these reviews are subjective instead of objective i simply state how it affected me. I liked the story line, I liked the animation, I liked the &#34;characters&#34;. I found it entertaining and amusing.
B003ICWTTM|5.0|This is a fantastic concert video - the Boss at his best!  Truly a great concert - great songs, lots of fun!
B008518MOW|4.0|OK I'm a sci-fi fan I admit it! I enjoyed the first MIB because it was an interesting blend of humor, adventure and the unexpected. So this is the third offering of the Men in Black story and it still manages to be novel in it's story line and the 3D adds to the mix of newness.<br />I enjoyed this video.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Omg so good read it now but the ending stocks bug chm set mix ssh kg ssh um cc ssh um
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This video will probably be one that you will love or simply dismiss but I &#34;saw&#34; it as a charming and entertaining story about a life event. The photography is excellent, the story line is intriguing, the acting is very good and your children might enjoy it too, in other words, it is a stand out movie for the family.<br />If you are looking for chase scenes, shooting and explosions, serial killers or drug lords Vs the law, political intrigue, or how we killed another terrorist in a Muslim Nation then you definitely will want to PASS on this one
B00992CF6W|5.0|Come on mojang I wish you would hurry up with the update. I am getting so impatient and its taking forever for you to come out with it. PLEASE HURRY!!!!!
B007MDB548|2.0|Story line did not deliver what was promised by product description. will probably resell this one - not good enough for my collection.

B000022TSY|5.0|This video seems representative of a short time in our history where a few rebelled against the buttoned down world they lived in and used this as an excuse to experiment with drugs and alternative life styles. This was known as &#34;flower power&#34; in San Fransisco and the drug culture in California Etc. You may disagree with what the characters are doing but still find it interesting to watch. The three main characters are brought to life in a most excellent way by Fonda, Nicholson and Hopper who, it is rumored, were really using drugs during the filming of this movie.<br />Just as the experiments yielded very little in real life, near the end of the movie Fonda's character announced, &#34;We blew it&#34;<br />This video is better viewed with a certain empathy and appreciation for a time lost in time.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This is the second Lee Child book that I've read. You do get drawn in pretty quick and the book is difficult to put down once you get going. And it's fun to read about a character (Reacher) that's smart, intuitive, has a keen eye for detail, is a skilled fighter - hand-to-hand as well as just about any weapon he can get his hands on. While the setting for the story was America, it is difficult to forget that the author is British. He uses terminology that is more common in Great Britain. For instance, a shotgun is not a 12 gauge, it's a 12 bore. One thing that was annoying in this book was that characters frequently ask question like, \\"Hell is that?\\" or \\"Hell are you doing?\\" The words \\"What the\\" are completely left out. I don't know if that's an editing problem or a British quirk that I've never noticed before, but it was annoying. And I'm guessing that the characters in his books have some pretty well defined shoulder muscles because of the high quantity of shrugging they're always doing. Overall Die Trying is a good read.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have waited since October for this book to come out in hopes of getting a resolution. I have been so excited to see how everything was going to end. Now, i wish i had never started the series....cause thats what this has become. I feel the author had plenty of story to end with this book....there is no reason to stretch  it out. Every time you get the feeling they are finally going to be happy she throws in another unbelievable twist. It gets to the point where you no longed feel the characters could be real at all. I know this is fiction but when u read a good book u put yourself in that book...but this much bad crap couldnt happen to the same people in a million years.  Enough is enough. This book was very disappointing. If Mrs. Day thought by dragging this out she would make more money i think she is badly mistaken. After this book i dont know if i will ever read another of her books. Shes gonna lose alot of fans!!  I feel i should be refunded for all 3 books after such a bad continuation.

Mary H Clark writes a good mystery that she manages to do with gory scenes and crude language as some others can't seem to do.

1567184855|5.0|I could not put this down, his experiences with people under hypnosis was captivating, plus the dialogue, and the written recording of their conversations, added to the depth, truth, and absorption of their own personal experience. I no longer fear death or the afterlife, and look forward to discovering my soul's purpose on this wonderful journey. It was captivating, exciting, and I cried tears of joy and familiarity quite often. It made me ponder, understand, and question all that I thought I &#34;knew&#34; about life.

B008220BP2|4.0|Summit Entertainment brings home zombie romance comedy \\"Warm Bodies\\" for fans of the walking dead to enjoy. Zombie movies are a dime a dozen right now. This charming little mix of action, horror, and a love story changes things up a bit. It provides a satisfying experience, yet left me surprised there wasn't more funny parts.<br /><br />\\"Warm Bodies\\" tells the tale of a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult). R spends his days wandering through an airport aimlessly. One day he saves a girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer) from an attack by the walking dead. The two become unlikely friends, which appears to restore R's humanity over time. Have they discovered a way to bring the zombie masses back to life?<br /><br />As a whole, \\"Warm Bodies\\" works. I have to say I was expecting more humor than I got. While it was funny, it fell short of delivering the grins trailers promised. Director / Writer Jonathan Levine did a great job with creating a bond between the two lead characters. However, Julie accepts the fact that R ate her boyfriend way too casually.<br /><br />The zombie carnage and gory imagery isn't downplayed anywhere near as much as one would expect in an adaptation of a young adult novel rated PG-13. There's plenty of scenes of the living dead eating dinner. Creatures called \\"Bonies\\" also offer a higher level of horror than what one would expect from a zombie romance / comedy.<br /><br />\\"Warm Bodies\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition with 7.1 surround sound audio. The picture looks great and is clear. Unfortunately, the hi-def transfer exposes the distracting CGI limitations of the \\"Bonies.\\" The audio experience is highlighted by great sound effects and a fitting musical score coupled with some relevant rock tracks throughout.<br /><br />The Blu-ray for \\"Warm Bodies\\" is packed with bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by Director Jonathan Levine and Actors Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer. There are seven \\"behind-the-scenes\\" featurettes which address everything from location scouting to casting and special effects. Teresa Palmer's home movies, acting tips provided by actor Rob Corddry, deleted scenes, gag reels, and a theatrical trailer round out the special features.<br /><br />Although \\"Warm Bodies\\" doesn't deliver the laughs I was expecting, it's still an entertaining and warm film. It's a less campy and more serious mix of 1993's \\"My Boyfriend's Back\\" and \\"I Am Legend.\\" There's something for horror fans and romantics to enjoy in this movie.ng from location scouting to casting and special effects.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Come on Sylvia Day, definition  of trilogy would be three. This story is being dragged on for no good reason.  Or would the reason be purely $$$?  While I love Gideon and Eva I feel mislead.
030758836X|1.0|The brief book synopsis sounded intriguing, but after reading it I really don't understand why this book has been so popular. Basically it is about a very dysfunctional relationship between a man who is a self-centered, spoiled brat, and his wife who is a psychopath. The power struggle between them to control and punish each other, yet still in some strange way be attracted to each other, was pathetic and sick. And the ending was a total anticlimax! I would give this book zero stars if that were an option. It is my least favorite book that our book club has read in the last year or so. Reader beware!
B00CAUH7UE|5.0|So many recent bestseller take a simple point and spin on it until the reader is almost dizzy, even though you feel like you grasp most of the concept after just looking at the book cover. Please do not pigeonhole &#34;Give and Take&#34; in this league but allow it to surprise you in a couple of rounds.<br /><br />The overall insight into giving and taking is that givers - in comparison to takers and &#34;matchers&#34; - are the population with both the most successful and least successful people. But the book does also bring amazing insights into team play and talent development among other.<br /><br />Grant's elegant storytelling is substantiated with references to a plentitude of scientific research - like Kahneman's &#34;Thinking, Fast and Slow&#34; and Cialdini's &#34;The Science of Persuasion&#34;, which are among other favorites of mine.
B000RFPORM|2.0|8 1/2 ties with Amarcord as a movie adorned with a most imaginative poster. It brings into my living room scenes from Italy, while I wish it also had a little substance and rigor. I am gonna pass this, and have an espresso to experience Italian brilliance.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This book was definitely worth the wait!  Ms. Singh never disappoints and she exceeded all my expectations for this book.<br /><br />Kaleb has never been my favorite character, he was too dark and with all that had been discussed about his character, I never had a real desire to know more. Boy, was I wrong. Finding out just how much he suffered and just how strong he was opened my eyes. I've never seen a more determined hero, the only comparison I can make is how much Judd went through to reduce his conditioning.<br /><br />Sahara starts out appearing very weak and needy but underneath she's solid steel. This is definitely a power couple and just how much power is unimaginable. Together they definitely complete each other. I can see Kaleb being a dynamic leader for the Psy and as long as Sahara is with him, he cannot fail.<br /><br />This story was so intricate that I had to slow down my reading pace to get it all in. I'll definitely be reading this again to get the full impact and pick up more details. A lot of questions were definitely answered. I really liked that the story is not ending, I can see the Psy rebuilding and leaving Silence behind so they can become what they should have been. The scope of the storyline has been significantly increased and I can see the characters who should have their own story.<br /><br />I just love it - stellar!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I cannot remember the last time I read a book and thought it had made me a better person.  &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34; by Khaled Hosseini did that to me.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|After reading the first two books in this Trilogy (?) Series I was eagerly awaiting what I thought would be a Happy Ending or finale.  Wrong!!!  I was shocked when I reached the end of this book.  I don't ever read the last few pages of any book and when this one ended I thought \\"Are you freeking kidding me?\\"  I feel so let down by the author for many reasons - not just the horrible ending.  I don't need to enlarge on all the negatives about this book.  They are well documented by other reviewers.  Let me just say, that I know all of you who have read the first two books will read this one anyway regardless of the criticisms.  Gideon's character is the only saving grace in this book.  Eva was written as a ridiculous, foolish and totally selfish young woman.  I neither care about her or will read the next installment.  What a total waste of my time.  What a sleazy thing to do to your readers Sylvia.  You are no J.K. Rowling and you probably lost many of your readers with this foolishness.
B009EE1GC4|5.0|I thought this movie was so great. Its such a feel-good, easy to watch, family-friendly movie. There are a lot of great actors and seeing India was lovely. Very funny too!
0425263924|2.0|I read some of the reviews here before I read the book and was surprised by all of the 1 star ratings. I read the book anyways since I had just re-read the first 2 in anticipation of what was supposed to be the last of the trilogy. While I was reading I couldn't understand why it had gotten such negative reviews....and then I got to the end. Seriously? WTF? It's like the author said 'screw it' and just stopped writing. No wrapping things up, no working to the end...just stopped. And the little note after the last page was a slap in the face to all of her readers. Then I sat and reflected on the book that I just read and realized that the story is just all over the place. Instead of one solid plot-line, there's a whole mess of weak ones. And really, what is the purpose of constantly reminding us when Eva is on her period. It has nothing to do with the story and we don't need to know that! Sylvia Day obviously stopped caring about her story when she started writing this book. She screwed up the story and she screwed up the characters. I'm done.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Played the demo and ended up purchasing it cause it drew me in and I couldn't stop playing it. Great storyline.  Great graphics. Highly recommend this game.

B0084U0IEG|2.0|The story just does not have impact throughout the read.  The overall plot does make you think about government agencies and how, perhaps, the FBI, CIA, Homeland Security, Foreign Service, affect things subtly through politics.  Sad story!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This story makes you think.  Is our Justice system truly the best it could be.  Does it protect the innocent or victims?  I think not!
B00AESN8XY|3.0|This game has the player create a plague that destroys all human life on Earth. I find the concept to be pretty gruesome and cruel (destroying all human life?! That's not fun, it's sick!!) However, this aside, it is very educational about how viruses spread and how they evolve. From a biology perspective, it is interesting because the game's difficulty accurately shows how difficult it is for a real world virus or bacteria to evolve to the point where it is not curable. Also, from the perspective of a quality game, it is designed well, has decent graphics and has addicting game content. Definitely worth a play or two.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Beautiful story, well developed, along the fantastic read.  It will envelope you especially if you are related to those who managed to survive during WWII.

1439190275|5.0|We very highly recommend this book. My wife and I both had high BP levels, out of whack triglyceride levels, and I had a high cholesterol level as well. I’ve tried this food change before but it was too difficult to maintain with the wife and kids eating the high sugar foods and such. Both of our doctors strongly suggested that we lose weight and both of our doctors also STRONGLY urged us &#34;AGAINST&#34; the Atkins style food change. Their &#34;balanced&#34; diet approach was thought best. After 2 years of really struggling with their suggested “balanced approaches”, and still having the high levels, my wife and I chose to do the Atkins diet and we started April 6, 2013. Now June 6th, I’m down 30 lbs. with only walking 30 to 40 minutes a day (because of an injury). My wife is down 25 lbs. but she too walks about 45 to 60 minutes outside of work, mostly to walk our dogs. We’re not hungry or weak either. There's lots of the good type veggies allowed whcih my wife misunderstood about this change earlier. Neither of us have been these low weights in 20 years and it's only been 2 months since we started. If there is any negativity about this book, it is that there should be more to it. We also bought a Carb and calorie counting book and a low carb recipe book off of Amazon to complement this one.We’d highly recommend this book and this type of food change for anyone trying to lose weight. If you have the ability to exercise more than we do I think the positive results will be even more dramatic. Take the chance.

B008TRUDAS|2.0|First the good news: the author earns her two stars for some nice writing here and there. Now the not-so-good news: this book is so contrived it is painful. Without giving too much away, everything &#34;happens&#34; to the character, who lands from happy coincidence to happy coincidence on her way to the inevitable happy ending. I really don't have anything against happy outcomes in literature, but the author should make some effort to convince us that the character has earned them, not that she just happens to always be in a fortuitous situation where the cards play out in perfect order. That is without getting into all the unrealistic events she conjures to achieve these plot objectives. As if in an attempt to inject some reality, there is overwrought drama but unlike in better-crafted works, it is a seamless part of the humdrum action so that instead of adding depth it seems like a forced attempt at feeling.
1849904251|5.0|The book Is hilarious and full of fun facts, I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the BBC show!
B007THA4FI|3.0|So like many other people, I bought this feeling like it would be worth every penny if it were even a fraction as brilliant as Harry Potter. And like so many others, I was sorely disappointed. Even by the standards of lower expectations, this book is one depressing read, confined to a claustrophobic community where there are few heroes and many villains. I admire JK Rowling's ability to create brutal circumstances for her most admirable characters; this necessarily adds drama. That works especially well when leavened with the fantastically imaginative worlds she is capable of creating in all their impressive dimensions. In a stuffy little suburb, not so much. There won't be a movie version of this one, I hope.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I am never at a lost for words but what can I say this was and AWESOME AND AMAZING STORY!! Nalini Singh did not disappoint the Fans of the series. The Ghost is much more than we expected him to be. He is Dangerous, Ruthless, and Psycho when it comes to his Mate in a good way.  I really loved the way Nalini balanced the Ghost's Darkness to his Mate's Light. The Ghost's Mate was equal to him in every way. Neither of the H/H individual personalities are compromised in the telling of the story. This is very hard to due, which shows us just how great an author Ms. Singh is. The sex is so Hot the Earth even Quakes. WOW! The story moves pretty fast and we get the answers to some question we have been waiting for and new questions arise. We also get to visit with all our old friends we have come to love through out the series. If you have not read the series; Which I Highly Recommend than don't start with this book. You need to read the series to get the full impact of the Ghost and his Mate and the Psy world. All I can say now is BRAVO MS. SINGH!! You didn't let us down!! I Highly Recommend this book to you and the entire series!!!
B007DIQC90|5.0|Every song on the cd is great to listen to.  Great lyrical imagery.  The two lead vocalists have unique but distinctly different voices that go great together.  Great musical arrangement.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another amazing story from Hosseini.  I happened to read this at a time in my life where I am losing 2 grandparents to dementia and Alzheimer's. I am an eternal wanderlust and all of my emotions couldn't have been better translated than in tis work.  But perhaps the most telling piece in this story is simply how plausible it could be. The world is a very small place indeed.

B003XDXMLU|5.0|I usually wear the clod-hopper short of Crocs, and needed something more feminine for when I go somewhere.<br />I have Chemical Sensitive/Severe Asthma, and can't take many manmade scents; but, the REAL Crocs do not set off my swelling, or a breathing problem, as do most other imitation forms of the shoe.<br />The only thing that I wish was different, with this size, is that it would run just a tiny bit wider.  It probably doesn't fit my foot right, because of the swelling I have most everyday; due to not being able to stay clear of manmade scented products and people who use them.<br />I am very happy with the Crocs, and am so glad to get out of the other ones.  I feel more feminine.  I do have a few pair for when I swell up really badly; then I have to switch back; or, when it rains, they come in handy for dealing with a very active puppy, who stands on my feet more than me, sometimes :)<br />As for this one, I am very happy to have it in my collection.  Wish I had known they existed long before this.<br />Thanks for making a great shoe___one that fits the foot correctly (except, as I said, when I swell).

6305428522|5.0|Quiz Show is one of those movies that never gets the attention it deserves.  The dialogue is fast and intelligent, and so nuanced by the actors that you really believe you are back in the age of Sputnik and cars with too much chrome.  Ralph Fiennes stars as Charles Van Doren, who was a Columbia professor who was just what the producers of the game show &#34;21&#34; were looking for....handsome, articulate, witty, and gentile.  The film is a fascinating study of what people are willing to do to gain cash and notoriety, and the hidden costs of that behavior.  Paul Scofield, as Van Doren's father, is excellent in providing the moral compass which his son has somehow lost.  When he reminds his progeny that his corrupt actions reflect on the family name it moves a person to tears.  John Tuturro as Herb Stemple also does a terrific job as the Jewish counterpart to Van Doren.

B007R21JJK|3.0|What I like: The PCIe slot placement is really good on this board. The overall build quality seems solid, considering it's not a \\"enthusiast grade\\" product. Using Q-Flash to update your BIOS is super easy! The Dual BIOS mode is nice, albeit it DID cause some complications to my issue below.<br /><br />What I'm on the fence about: Not sure what to make of the VIA integrated audio chipset. I've had some weird quirks with it. It constantly wants to default to HDMI audio, even though I'm using mm audio jacks to stereo speakers. I had to go as far as disabling the HDMI audio after attempting multiple times to force the mm audio as the default output in Windows 8. That seems to have \\"shut it up\\"... but it's still annoying.<br /><br />What I was talking about in the subject: When I started my initial Windows 8 Install, I was having the hardest time getting my video card (AMD 6950 - reference design + 6970 bios hack) to initialize. I had to use the integrated video of my i7-2600k CPU just to get the install done. When it came time to install the AMD driver, it couldn't detect that I had a video card installed. I tried disabling the integrated video, forcing discrete video, resetting the bios - all accomplishing nada. I tried the alternate bios which added a different set of problems I'm not even going to rant about right now. So I googled the issue and dug through the gigabyte support forums and read similar strings detailing the issue I was having, but with no clear fix. There was one thread I found that suggested flashing the bios to the most current version then RMAing. So I looked to see what BIOS I had. Lo and Behold, I had the most current BIOS version already. So for BMs and giggles, I tried flashing my bios to the same version anyway. That ended up solving my problem. Now the dGPU works fine, Virtu works fine, QuickSync works fine (for the 1 app I have that uses it :-/ ), and SSD caching works fine. Thankfully, I didn't have to RMA the board. If I needed too, I mayhave dropped this thing like a hot rock.<br /><br />Overall: Not a bad board. I actually do like it. I'm just really miffed that I had to do a BIOS flash from the start for the same BIOS I already had. I wasted so much time trying to figure out something I shouldn't have right from the start. And this is probably an internet first when I say \\"I actually want Realtek integrated audio\\". WTH, Gigabyte? I know this is a value performance board, but c'mon! At least make sure these things are leaving the factory with a proper flash! I buy ALOT of Gigabyte boards for their consistent level of quality (that I'VE experienced, anyway. YMMV) and this is an honest-to-god first.<br /><br />So assuming you don't have the same issues I did, you should be fine with this board. If you DO have issues getting a dGPU working, take my advice and prepare to flash the BIOS. Or better yet... just preemptively flash the board to the most current version. If there is ONE thing I can say that's 100% positive, QFlash does work really well and the Dual BIOS pretty much makes it so that you can't fry this board from a bad flash or borked setting.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I've got a lot of time and money invested in the Oregon trail and I'm not very happy with the update.  The game developers do not respect long time players.  Feeding buildings cash now, what a joke.  How about a way to manufacture cash like little big city.  I've bought enough cash. 9B
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is hands down the best &quot;farmvale type&quot; app. The rare dragons aren't impossible to get, it doesn't nag you to play more, updates very often, and has some really cool designs that aren't like the hideous &quot;tiny castle&quot; and &quot;tiny monsters.&quot; They also have dragons for the 2012 apocalypse, sun phases, holidays, the months birthstones, treasure, and even a year of the dragon one called the panlong. The game also doesn't force you to do buy stuff with real money to move on in the game. Overall my favorite app ever.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|I bought for my friends. So I have not listened it.But now I can download the mp3 from the internet. That's good.
B00CX1TSSO|1.0|I was told when I was very small that bad movies are made because someone thought a gay man should not be consulted  in making the movie  and no lesbians don't count..  they  would ignore you...  What  straight person  made this movie.. terrible..  too all my gay brothers and sisters who are gay and know how to read do not watch.. Horrible..  you will have nightmares for weeks.... no offense to my lesbian sisters  I just know if you thought it was crap you would pop them upside the head..  I  wasted my money  with this movie...  I quit  watching  or buying  anything with the sciencetolgist people...  I accept religion  but yours is weird..  I would not have you in my home  not even to watch your crap movie..  the two witness's  will prove me right
B007BVOEPI|5.0|mother a British citizen, I am always facinated about this period in time. Problem is I could not turn it off. Watched &#34;ALL&#34;first season non stop. Could not wait to purchase second season. &#34;BUT&#34; after purchasing (2) seasons I really do not have the extra money for all the other seasons.  wish there was abetter way to watch this show.WHY SO MUCH MONEY? Can I get suggestions?
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow very wow just wow omg it was good liked hunger games better but it was very interesting wow just
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|The game is fun. Kinda like TF2 but for mobile. Theonly thing bad about it is that the weapons are a bit to powerful such as the pistol which is pretty much a sniper rifle. Otherwise fun game!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is fun and hard to put down.  I have drained my Kindle battery more than once playing this game.  It's challenging, but not impossible.  A great puzzle game.  Good brain exercise.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The new minecraft pocket edition update just came out and I'm so EXCITED!!!!! It Is not available on the Kindle Fire yet bit will be shortly (HOPEFULLY!)
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|3.5 stars for the first 70%<br />4.5 stars for the last 30%<br /><br />The first 70% of the book didn't really have a storyline.  Gideon & Eva had a lot of sex.  They talked a lot.  But the story wasn't really going anywhere.  I like Gideon & Eva well enough that it didn't really bother me.  I just felt like I was reading about their daily life.  The storyline picked up the last 30% of the book, and then the book just ended.  There's no cliffhanger.  The story just ended.  I look forward to the next book to find out how the storyline unravels.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I thought the film was excellent. Saw it twice in movie theaters when it first came out, and have now viewed it a third time on the DVD.  It continues to be a moving experience, with great acting, direction, sets, music, photography.<br /><br />BUT, the DVD is set up in such a way that you have to sit through several previews and a repetitious anti-smoking ad in order to see the film.  Every time you want to see it.  Any attempt to skip ahead through the previews is defeated and you're sent back to the beginning.  You even have to sit through the previews if you want to separately view the little featurette about the making of the film.  This is maddening.  It's bad enough that you have to sit through 10-15 minutes worth of previews and ads to see a film in the theater.  Subjecting home viewers to this is unconscionable.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|Battery Doctor has good tips for cutting battery usage, and makes it easy to tell when you're low on power.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is cool but if you have a kindle you can get minecraft inv<br />Which lets you do stuff like change survival to creative and get things from survival like lava blocks and  chainmale armor
B001MEJY8W|5.0|This is not an easy movie to watch. I purchased it because it made a list of 25 Most Disturbing movies ever made. It certainly made the list.  This movie allows allows us to see what can happen to people when they experience trauma in the extreme. For that reason it is worth seeing.  It is not just about gratuitous violence.  My one complaint would be that the movie is in French. My DVD was poorly subtitled meaning that on average you got about one line of translation for about every minute of dialog. I figured out what was going on
0810993139|3.0|Told through the view of a Greg, a kid who's morale compass is still a bit off, middle-school is portrayed hilariously.  The cartoon-like illustrations also add entertainment.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I loved this film and Denzl Washingtons performance was great!  If one wants to see  what an alcoholic goes through, watch this movie.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|great app! it's so much fun because you get to do many fun things like choose hair styles, give a facial and apply make-up to her face, choose her dress and accessories, and it is free!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Would like more HO scenes but fun graphics. Sounds are good but music is repetitive. Hope sequel will include more scenes.
B00992CF6W|1.0|i paid 7 dollars for this game and i paid for  having the current version of the app! it is june 6 and it is supposed to be out today. And until this problem is fixed i will rate a 1 star since there are no 0 stared ratings
B00992CF6W|3.0|I have a lot of fun but where is the 0.7 app update? When the update comes then it will get 5 stars.
B008M721MS|2.0|I find that skype diconnects after a couple of minutes in both video call and just voice.  Very frustrating when online to family.
0393078299|5.0|No need to be familiar with quantum physics to enjoy this book. A very good history of the GIANTS in science.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This story is super hot and a great read!!!  The first book is \\"Bared to You\\" second book is \\"Reflected in You\\" and the third book is Entwined With You\\", but what I didn't know that it still doesn't end!!!!  GRRRRRRR. These series books drive me insane, especially when some of them do not come cheap.  I think I read  Reflected in You last summer!!!!!  It took all this time to get this third one.  Of course they don't tell you that you have to keep buying and buying!  Now it will probably be another year for the next one.  And there's was no name to the next one!!!!  After that long, you forget what the others were about.  Sad because it is a fantastic story.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I played it for a short while.  Got old real quick.  Only played it when I first got it.  Oh well.
B005HSL626|4.0|fruit ninja is super addicting. i love unlocking the new blades. i would recommend this app because it's really fun and free
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Shocked like everyone that this book was not the final in the series. Glad because there is so much more to be told about the characters (Eva and Gideon) but also everyone else that is apart of this entire story. Everyone must remember that their story is told day by day and monumental things are going to take time to happen.<br /><br />Just like the 2nd book, it picks up where the other left off. Sylvia Day is very good at putting twists in a story to where one thinks for certain the story will undoubtly go one way and it does not. Lots of surprises, I feel and shockers! One will definitely see and feel the love between them and Gideon is one breath taking man and Eva is his world!!!<br /><br />With other reviews being really bad...I was scared to read but I can honestly say it was a great book and these characters have developed from the last two and their isn't a trust issue as before.  I believe readers will leave the 3rd book with some peace with their relationship however things are not ideal and still so many things are unresolved and lots of new shockers in the world around them!!<br /><br /> I am looking forward to the continuation of Eva and Gideon!!! :)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|flow free is super addicting!i can't stop playing it. i would definitely recommend  it because i can't think of anything bad about it.
B00BUT5HJ4|5.0|30 Seconds to Mars has given us a new album that is one of the best I have ever heard. It fits perfectly in progression from their first three albums. I truly believe there is nothing they cannot do.Was nervous waiting to hear this album didn't think anything could compare to to A Beautiful lie then This is war came and now LLF&D has proved that they can,and do -  constantly make great music. Starting with the song Birth - which I wish was longer  - you know this album is spectacular.Conquistador is one of rocks best - yes Jared Leto is the best and more - vocalist, lyricist etc... - his passion for their music reaches into my soul and brings out so many emotions it is overwhelming at times. Up in the Air is fun and energetic and makes you dance.City of Angels is a tribute to LA, their home town and the lyrics are powerful.End of All Days is my not only my favorite song on the album it is also one of my favorite songs ever. The passion in Jared's voice envelops you and makes you want abandon what you are doing and follow this band anywhere.The Race, Do or Die , Bright Lights are all well written and emotionally charged sons. Pyres of Varanasi, Convergence and Depuis Debut are unique and add a very special feeling to this album.Love the music box ending in Depuis - Am so excited to share this album with my friends I have bought the LP - 8 CD'S  - 1 for both cars - 1 for home - 5 for friends and 1 download for my daughter. Everyone of them has loved it. They cannot wait for Mars to tour USA- they will come with me to the concerts!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I love all of the games like this. they're all wonderful. They're just challenging enough to make it worthwhile.<br />Definitely recommend this and all similar games.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie is a wonderful example of a solid story with a thoughtful plot with exceptional acting.  Received in great condition and fast shipping.. thank you
B007XF0X16|4.0|I bought this one because we loved the first one.  I thought that the special effects were great and was fast moving with lots of action.  My 19 year old daughter and my 22 year old son loved it and I just liked it.  I felt that it was missing something. They needed a better screenplay. Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson were awesome together.
0143121421|3.0|I saw John LaCarre on a YouTube video describing the story as having characters that were not of a strong nature and having a rather dismaying demenor.  He said that he had a hand in the movie making and was not in favor of having Richard Burton and Claire Bloom as the actors in the lead roles just because of that. After reading the book I agree with the author.  I found the plot too fantastical and the story has a distressing unsatisfying conclusion.  It may be been a #1 bestseller but I found it disapointing.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect because I heard some of the negatives from all the nerds out in nerdland. I have no idea what they were complaining about.  I love this movie.  I heard they were upset about how he filmed this movie.  He used a new camera.  Seriously!  I guess you just can't make everyone happy.  I thought this movie was beautifully filmed.  I highly recommend!
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Was not impressed.  I usually like Quinten's off the wall movies, but this one was a bit too much/campy. Could have been great, but it just wasn't.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|My 19 year old daughter wanted this album for her birthday to add to her ipod.  She loves this band.  Highly recommend.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love, Love her talent for writing and performance. Coming close to Mariah's  set of pipes. So young and so wonderful already.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Bought this CD for my 19 year old daughter's birthday per her request.  She loves this band and is very happy it's on her ipod.  Highly recommend.  I also like this band.  They were great when they appeared on SNL.  Highly recommend.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Best documentary I've ever seen in the  music category. A lesson in reality and in grace. Rodriguez models the highest level of dignity human beings are capable of. This is a treasure. Don't miss it!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I bought this for my 19 year old daughter's birthday per her request.  Of course, she loves JT and is happy he finally released a new CD.  She thinks this is a great CD and she loves all the songs.  Highly recommend.  I love JT too!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game!!! Though I like to listen to music on Pandora when I play games, and a song about a car crash came on... omen?
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|I bought this CD for me and for my 22 year old son.  We are huge fans of these two.  Their previous collaboration was amazing and we were thrilled they came together again.  Highly recommend.
B00457X7IQ|5.0|Fantastic reading, great story lines in all four books, didnt want them to stop, would put it up there with a few of my favorite authors
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Riveting!  Cleverly written  featuring two women; slave and<br />White.  I could not put it  down  and know all who read this will treasure the story.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics are amazing &amp; your ability to navigate the room in 3-D is smooth &amp; seamless. I was bummed when I got to the end because I didn't want it to be over.I hope they make another one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Basically get to have minecraft now everywhere! The new update coming soon will add lots of nifty features. How one day to be like the console version.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Each time I try to open the game on my kindle fire it says it is checking for updates, then just closes. I can't get in anymore. Earlier version worked much better
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I don't usually read memoirs, but when I do, I want them to be hilarious, yet poignant and Tina Fey's Bossypants was definitely that. Tina Fey can tell one hell of a story and as we all know she's freaking hilarious. This book is filled with great anecdotes, stories, unsolicited advice and the nitty gritty of following your dream. I adore Tina and I think her story on how she's gotten to where she is as a comedian was great. I loved reading about her insecurities and the roadblocks she came up against. It's amazing that she still feels insecure even after everything she's accomplished, but I think that it's refreshing that she is aware of herself enough to admit those insecurities to everyone. And to finally learn how she got that scar...holy crap that's scary.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the rest of her story in forty years when she writes her next memoir. Of course she might not do that, but if she does, I'll be there to learn all about how the rest of her life works out, especially her 2 daughters growing up.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I really enjoy puzzle games and this one is no exception. This game very much reminds me of 7th Guest and it's sequel 11th Hour. My only real complaints are that the game was pretty short and the ending was somewhat anticlimactic. Outside of that, the game is superb and I would easily spend the$2 all over again for it. I hope they expand on this soon.
1781162646|1.0|I normally like Stephen King but I don't appreciate anyone telling me how I should read my books. I travel all the time and I refuse to pack actual books. It's the 21st century. Stephen, please don't be a 65 year old fart and try to buck what readers want.
B00BOXZAJ8|2.0|God, what a waste of time this was to watch. In a world with no explanation as to why, Earth, I presume, has another version of itself right next to it. Somehow gravity and laws of physics allow the two planets to co-exist. There is a building that magically never breaks as the two worlds spin that is joined to each other. One is considered the poverty world, and one the richer side. Two kids from each planet end up meeting on a high enough mountain where they communicate with each other. They end up falling in love, and then something happens and he thinks she's dead. Only she isn't, so the next day he goes to work in the building with an idea to make an anti-wrinkle cream based on gravitational pull, while secretly trying to find her on the other world. There so called Romeo & Juliet tale is not, it was a boring story and no emotion to any of it. But I get it, two loves forbidden, blah, blah, blah. It would have been a better movie if they focused more on the plot and making these characters something more than just two people who met, and you know exactly how it will end. Instead the attention is mostly focused on the CGI work, hence, another Matrix movie... little plot, no interesting story, just a bunch of visual effects to say, \\"Hey, look what we can do with computers... oh yeah, throw any old story around it, who cares, people will love the effects and not worry about the plot\\". Nope, not the case here. Nice visuals, terrible movie.
B001VTTRC6|5.0|Sean Penns performance was no less than an a Oscar winning performance and a real honest to goodness parents feelings and behavor at the discovery at the Lions Gate, I cried so hard,knowing if it were my child,I would kill the person responsible for taking her from me The whole movie was so good, Dave's wife did not care much for her husband to do or act the way she did ..all the characters were played very well in this very dramatic, thought provoking movie..well worth buying...

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I have played this one over and over, and the familiar tunes tend to stay with you, even when you aren't thinking of them. Still one ot the best albums I own..
B00A7Z8KAU|1.0|The menus showing the brushes, pencils,shapes,lines etc. come up on the screen but when I select an instrument and a shape I can not get anything on the screen. A friend has an android device with a different version of SKETCH BOOK with the same menu selections and I have no difficulty drawing with it. I don't know if it is my Kindle or the program but I can not get it to work.

B00BGIC4I6|4.0|This movie was pretty good, we enjoyed it. I wouldn't say it was great, but definitely worthy of a rental. If I had paid $15 to take my wife to see this, I probably would have given it 3 stars, factoring in price, however we paid $2, so it was definitely worth it!
B0018QOIXU|4.0|I liked the songs all right, but they don't catch your interest or attention as well as the following album does
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|This movie was very entertaining. I typically like to factor the cost into my rating. I paid 3.99 to rent this, so it was definitely worth the money, and I enjoyed watching it. I would say I probably would have given it a 3 star rating had I paid $12 admission to see it in theater. I look forward to the next installment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers rocks! I play this game every single day. I am just downloading the subway surfers Miami. You should buy this app.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|I worked with electronics for about 7 years, (Fry's Electronics). There were always debates about the best memory. Personally, I have never had a sticky of memory fail, or one be DOA. So when selecting memory to expand that of a NAS drive, I was just looking for the cheapest option. This Kingston stick installed easy, and  worked no problem. I think memory is like a child who dies of SIDS, in that you don't know anyone that has experienced it, but you do know someone, who has a brother, who's ex gf's dad heard of someone that experienced it first hand. Memory is memory.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If people say WHAT 6.99 thats expensive! Deal with it same with pc and xbl this is a special game that millions of people enjoy while people are getting mad at bugs! They will fix it just takes time for them to work on xbl,pc,and pe! But yeah this is a special game no matter what.
B00000B9N3|5.0|I had listened to this cd repeatedly at a friend's and I'd loved it. Apart from that said in the banner above, the vivid atmosphere plus the arrangements, including the accordion, makes this recording wonderful.<br />Yes, I would recommend it to others.

0385349947|5.0|If you are a woman, and in the working world, you've got to read this well researched and inspiring book!  Sheryl backs up her main points with peer reviewed research and great anecdotes.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Love, love, love this hidden object game. Once I finished Mysteryville 1, I was primed to find another one just as good - and I found it! Good graphics, good storyline (although the &#34;dialogues&#34; are a little long at times, but there's a way to skip them), doable yet still challenging levels. I give this two thumbs up.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|I love most of Quentin Tarantino's work and did see this film in the theaters and couldn't wait until it was released on BluRay.  Never the less, almost everyone has already discussed the plot, the language, the acting, the film's significance and almost everything else there is to say about the film.  Thus, as I always do with my reviews, I will focus only upon the transfer of the film to Blu Ray.<br /><br />VIDEO...4.5  .Very clean transfer with no artifacting that I could see.  Very nominal grain exists that you would have to really look hard to see and a slight motion blur only in the shots of the tall grass which is an image that is difficult to reproduce.  Color grading is mostly warm toned with cool toning only in the, as expected, winter scenes.  I saw no evidence of stair stepping or aliasing of any kind.  Stairstepping would have been present, if it were to be, in the tall grass and field scenes but I did not denote any of it.  Color reproduction seemed very natural to my eyes.  The only negative in the transfer occurred in some of the early parts of the film where black colorations appeared as if they had been crushed more than I can recall from the theatre showing.  Whenever blacks are crushed, one loses details.  In all other scenes, fine details were very present in clothing creases, skin wrinkles and even the hairs in a beard were not mushed in a blur but could be seen in a very detailed manner.<br /><br />AUDIO...4.0  The audio is a lossless DTS MA 5.1 spread and while the audio levels are perfectly set so that you will not have roller coaster your remote's volume control, the first half of the film really didn't present as much left and right, rear panning or foley effects as I expected to hear.  The music soundtrack is nicely spread across the front stage and all dialogue is perfectly transparent and easy to decipher.  The second half of the movie, especially starting with the gunfight at Candyland, really brings the audio into play with discreet use of the rear speakers for foleys as well as  panning between the two audio stages. This is also where the LFE channel starts to earn its living.  Quiet nice.<br /><br />The extras include a Standard Definition DVD whose audio is Dolby Digital 5.1.  I did not watch the video of the disc.  Also included are interesting documentaries about the horse stunt work and other production elements.  A dedicated doc is made to the production designer who apparently passed away during the making of the film.  They do not say what caused his passing as he appeared to be a young middle aged individual whom everyone on the set seemed to love.  Another extra is an advertisement for the Quentin Tarantino collection of films, most of which I have as individual discs and another advertisement for the soundtrack of the film.  There was one other doc on costume design that I have not yet watched.<br />I am on a Mac so the Ultraviolet download is useless to me since I have tried and failed many times to figure out how to download the film to my iTunes.<br /><br />Bottom line is that if you liked this film you should definitely go the higher end route and get the blu ray.  Glad I did.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.se of the rear speakers for foleys as well as  panning between the two audio stages.

0897500482|2.0|I bought this book because I wanted to know what Bruce Lee<br />mean Jeet Kune Do.  In this book he tried to explain how to fight<br />in his own way, however; did not explain what Jeet Kune Do is.<br />So I just grade this book 2 points. Do not recomend.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Do ot read this if you have not read Book 3...<br />I hardly write reviewes..I spend too much time with my face in a book!! But for this book.....I must say my peace. I thought this was a trilogy when the series started and had it in my mind that the story would wrap up in the 3rd book. Well, I have been put in my place since there is going to be 2 more books!!!!! I have noticed alot of people commenting about dragging the series out; no no no no no fellow GR lovers that is not what I see happening. Book 1, got Gideon and Eva together ad introduced us to all their drama and set the stage. Book 2 their drama started to fester and tore them apart. Book 3, well it was perfect. Are couple comes back together, you see an emotional adult bond made throughout the book that was not in book 1 or 2. They compramise, talk things out and you truley get their connection. They do not abandon eachother for anyone else, and helloooo they get married!!! Book 4 and 5, yes this will be a long series, but lets look at it like this.... We are going to get the FULL story, from begining to end. Unlike other books, where you have an epilogue 5 years in the future..GOD I HATE THAT....I want the whole story sometimes. Gideon and Eva have tons of drama to deal with, lets reviewe just the major issues...that mega-bitch Corrine and her ass of a husband, ex-rocker boyfriend, Gideon's bitchy-hatefull mom, a Russian mob connection with a connection of Eva being sold ito human trafficking and who covered for Gideon when he killed Nathen. Plus, we need all the juicy story as their life and marriage together. I want to see them get pregnant, and read the story of an over protective Gideon deal with a pregnant wife and watch him evolve into an amazing father. So, I think Sylvia is going to bless us with a complete story...with no 5 year gap!!! The only problem is.... I want the books Now!!!
0425263924|5.0|I loved this!! It had a great story and was SO romantic I couldn't stand it.<333333 Eva and Gideon are perfect.<br /><br />That being said, sure this book has it's flaws. I mean, yes it was slightly more predictable than I would have liked and there were other things but WHATEVER. If you loved the first 2 books then you'll probably at least like this one a lot. It had the same feel as the first two books. Buutt I think Eva and Gideon's relationship enters a whole new level in this book (both sexually and otherwise). Also, I liked how some of the side characters got a little more page time esp Megumi. It was great to get to know her better!<br />All in all great book. Read it. Love it . DO IT.

The next generation of a real blues man is here. Love the ep, can't wait to get his Blak and Blu cd. Watch the videos on you tube. If your a blues fan, it's right on!

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|You definitely get back into the story line of the last book which I love! This book took some twist and turns I wasn't expecting but I love every bit of it. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars I loved that it ended on a nice note, but dislike it gave nothing away to the next book it just ended.
