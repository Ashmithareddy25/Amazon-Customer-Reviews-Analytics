B003W5C0VM|5|This is the best video of Mick Taylor's guitar genius ever.  Mick Taylor made the Stones during their best years - Let It Bleed - Sticky Fingers - Exile - Goat's Head Soup -  Only Rock 'n Roll.  These are the Stones, nothing since compares.  This movie is the peak of rock and roll guitar.  Keith is the guitar front man, but Taylor provides the magic.  Fitting that he left, it had been achieved. This movie captures the greatest rock and roll music ever.
B003VPWXRO|4|It is always refreshing hearing dark stories that have the potential to help others who have similar struggles. I praise Portia for her strength and ability to write about her intense past. Well done.
B006BGZJJ4|1|I needed it for charging my kindle book and it absolutely does not fit the plug of the book, neither any other device I own!!!!!!!!!!!
B003274QH6|5|This movie came in excellent condition and was packaged well. It is a funny and entertaining group of movies. Thank you.
1608872750|5|AND WE DID! I got this for my son as a birthday gift and he has kept it close by.  was able to browse through it too and appreciate very much what went with the manual.  Its really, REALLY COOL! my Son Happy... me happier.
B000002AZ8|5|this cd was absolutely amazing!!  buy it..if pearl jam is music to your ears....this cd will revitalize your soul and flow trough your mind as forever the greatest pearl jam cd in history...even though the last song scares the crap out of me.  vinyl i love you with all of my heart...
B005S9EK5Y|5|Best movie !!!
0763644765|5|Cute book!
B0030HOHU4|4|Not new but any time it shows up on pay channels I watch it (HBO, MAX, etc.)  It's on Netflix and we have the DVD so that pretty well sums up how we enjoy it, we are still fans though of the much older Christopher Lee versions, we were young and long before any special effects such as the last 25 years!
B00THHH9W4|5|I like to imagine everyone in Blur was sitting around a room, and after a long silence of watching everyone else coming out with albums, without saying anything, they all stood up, walked in unison to the recording studio in the next room and hit record. They had never turned off their creativity, just left it unplugged for 12 years.<br /><br />Artists and groups sometimes tie their album's production with the physical place they recorded it. Blur sporadically recorded this during a long week in Hong Kong, and if that was the magic that made this album so listenable, I want all my favorite groups to fly to Hong Kong for a week. The album will connect to everyone in a different way, but it sounded like Broken Bell's outer space sound, combined with Damon's Britpop flavor, and a lot more electronic sounds you've heard with other Blur works. It's an alternative rock band's album alright, but no particular sound is overpowering another; Damon's voice so perfectly compliments the instruments, as the instruments dance with his voice. Alternative rock groups wish their 'creative' side, which usually leaves the listener a little weirded out, sounded as good as Blur just being, well...Blur.<br /><br />It's easy to be skeptical when a group has been out so long, then comes out with another album. Thankfully, this is the first album released this year that has left me simultaneously pleasantly relaxed and upbeat. I'm glad Blur emerged from the scattered years and created this album for everyone to enjoy and didn't leave it unfinished in the Orient: it's going to get a lot of plays in my circle. I don't have a clever ice cream or Blur reference to end this review on, but this album is a flavor of music we've been missing that has brought clarity to my cloud-filled album library.<br /><br />Oh, wait...
B000SEFNMS|4|Had an interesting writing organization. It wasn't chronological and each chapter began with cool quotes from classic books that connected back to the story. I thought it was interesting.
B00FAPF5U0|4|It's quite addictive.
B00G3L6KQI|5|Absolutely wonderful book. Long awaited, but well worth it.  I couldn't wait to finish it, but dreaded it ending. Perfect!
B006LSZECO|4|What a captivating story! I really enjoyed the novel, I loved the 'he said' 'she said' alternating chapters, that was pleasantly unusual, and added enough pause in the action to make it hard to put the book down.<br />The reason I have it 4 stars is because in the last third of the book things got a little... predictable. The action was building up so nicely, so many twists and turns and unexpected throws, and suddenly... not so much. But don't let it stop you from reading it, it's a page turner, and almost like watching a reality show, front row to someone's marriage and realtionship. Not my cup-a-tea usually, but I enjoyed this one.
B008K9SG9K|5|Heard the song on the radio and loved it, listened to a couple of tracks on Amazon and knew i wanted it. Looking forward to the groups next album.
B00BD99JMW|5|Would recomend this series to everyone!!  I read till couldnt keep eyes open!! Hoping for another book soon!! Couldnt put it down!!!
B0014DQSGW|4|Great romantic comedy. Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant have an amazing chemistry together with funny banter and wit that has you laughing through most of the movie.
B009MCRHH6|5|good quality<br />thank you
B00DJFIMW6|5|I am a big kid at heart and love playing games like these!!! It works great on my kindleFire!!! My kids love playing the game also and I can't get them off of it to keep it charged up!!!
B005FVNJTS|4|From a sportsman's point of view it is really interesting finding out what it takes to be so good. How do you get there? What are you thinking about. Tidbits on nutrition, training, motivation and how you think. The author has cleverly wound a young man's life into two major tennis matches keeping some suspense and interest into a life that revolves around training, competing and winning. Well written and an easy read.
B0099RFVXQ|5|Watch before you see Iron Man 3. So, having said that : my brother, my daughter & myself (age 30 to 65) LOVED IT - period.<br />Most special was a part between Loki & Dr. Banner. Don't miss, you will regret it.
B00GT67UUM|4|Fun, enticing
B00A9ET4MC|5|Excellent!  Definitely a page turner. Extremely well written story and it was so enlightening to get to see what American race relations look like to an outsider. I absolutely recommend this book.
014242417X|5|Excellent
B00O8NPCA8|4|Really good story that wraps up very nicely. However, the ending sucks.
B008JEJOAG|5|Nice grey color with lime green soles!  Great to throw on for walking dogs or working in the yard, etc.  Love my Crocs--ordered this pair to replace the last pair which finally started to wear out on the soles!  Get some!
B005LAIH2M|5|I simply love this movie, great effects and good plot also not to bad of acting. I recommend this movie.
B004JN1D2I|2|I thought the Kindle books were supposed to be cheaper; What a joke. Out of principle alone I will purchase from a source other than Kindle.
B00AEBB9GY|5|Superstar is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It's about the popular Saturday Night Live character Mary Katherine Gallagher (portrayed by Molly Shannon) participating in the school talent show in order to impress one of her classmates Sky Corrigan (portrayed by Will Ferrell). With the help of her classmates and her grandmother, Mary is able to pull together a showstopping song and dance number worthy of a &#34;superstar&#34; like herself.<br /><br />Being that it's a spin-off of Saturday Night Live, this movie should not to be taken seriously and even though Will Ferrell is a part of the cast, it's not nearly up to par with all of the more &#34;professional&#34; movies out there. I also wouldn't recommend kids under the age of 13 watching this movie since it uses a large amount of swear words and a few sexual references here and there. Despite this, Superstar is an extremely funny movie that will have you laughing all the way through.
B008ER9QKG|1|Maybe it ties for worst, the compeditor being the latest Traviata from the Met.<br />Both productions disconnect the visual from the musical and emotional.  The staging in the case of the Ring adds nothing to the understqanding of the drama, but rather serves as a distraction.<br />If this were a CD set, the souundtrack would be worth having, although Terfel would not be my choice for Wotan.<br />To contrast this staging with another with minimal background, watch the DVD of Die Walkure by Simon Rattle.  The backgrounds are so bare this might as well be a concert performance, but the direction is superb and the emotional intensity of the singers blazes from the screen. One forgets the backround and is swept by the music and actin.<br />Westbrook is the Seiglinde in both versions, but In the Rattle Walkure her passion burns up the stage. In the Met performance, she is barely acting.<br />I think that the problems encountered by the staging and poor direction affect the singers negatively, and  distract them rom the drama.<br />I have been a supporter of the Met, but if this is the dirction they are taking, I will no longer cont;inue.
0062082353|5|This Hard-bound with Cover book shows no Wear.  The story runs through his diary accounts.  He acts as his own Forward Observer in directing fire like in Artillery.  He covers Ammo,  Rifle, Scope & Camo.  He learns how to act being attached to Units.  The training of Breath control and trigger letoff are made second-nature.  He becomes a one-man SWAT team in the Military.  First he learns--later he shares with his junior acolytes.  His regrets are about men who he could not save.  He gives thanks to his publisher W. Morrow as enabler.  Autobiography-2012 is followed by his demise not in Combat. I as trained in Artillery US Army 1967 & Gave a lesson on Sniper Training FM.  Also we studied Camo/Infiltration per FM.  I was top new shooter,  winning .45  CG National Trophy Team Match where we used all the tricks in our book.  In 8TH Grade I won top Score in NRA(LIFE Member) Junior Indoor .22 Prone, Sitting, and Standing.  So Maybe this book had Commonality for me.  Good Shooting.  DAS  Old 70YR Soldier.
1601251505|5|I've been playing Tabletop Games for about 3 years now and when I heard about Pathfinder, I knew it was for me. I have been trying to get my hands on this book for quite some time, but the price was never where I wanted it to be. Finally, I gave in and purchased this book and I am completely impressed. This is everything you need to start playing Pathfinder and MORE! It has sections about Gamemastering, running the game yourself, and Campaign creation, creating a world unique to you and your friends, as well as the complete rules set. If you're into tabletop gaming or just enjoy fantasy genres and want to create your own world, give this book a try!
6304578458|5|I really enjoyed the dark nature of this movie, not only was it fantastically funny, but it made you think. That is the best part of a movie, the way you continue to think about it after it is finished. You  could really watch this over and over without getting tired of it!  If you  buy it there will be no regrets, I promise!
B007XKEY6Q|5|i love this game... i eventually paid for it on both my kindle and my phone. worth the download.. its free, try it and see what everyone is talking about!
B00F8L2VO4|4|A very nice language learning tool. Easy to use. Now if I'd only use it!
B00PSID6ZK|5|I just got this game and it's sweet
0385523912|5|This was a very interesting book about the difficulties and general conditions of life in North Korea. I was hooked immediately and learned quite a bit from this book while enjoying the process of doing so.    Note: I've seen some comparisons between this book and \\"The Road\\" (McCarthy) and I just wanted to state my disagreement with them. This book felt very 'real' to me while \\"The Road\\" seemed phony perhaps because it was fiction, I don't know.
B008Y5OW20|5|Jeff Lynne is a consummate musician and a great artists. No stone was left unturned on this collection old OLDIES which influenced his career. MUCH BETTER than the similar McCartney offort (with a full band)- EVERY riff and rythm (including voice) is Lynne's! Great stuff!!!!!
B00KA7JIII|5|Beautiful!
B00VFTA70I|4|I don't want to.
B006LSZECO|4|This book is a great read.  You're hooked to find out what is really going on, and then when you do, you're hooked at the craziness of it all.  I like there to be some justice, but maybe with two deeply flawed characters justice was served.
B0064X7FVE|1|Clunky,  hard to use design. Overly complicated -just updated it thinking it would improve but it hasn't changed noticeably,  so I'm looking for a replacement.
0316666343|4|Susie Salmon's life ends on the second page of the novel, The Lovely Bones, but she forges ahead to tell her story from the unsettling circumstances of heaven and the silent shadows surrounding her family and friends. Brutally murdered at the age of 14, Susie can only observe life on earth and the impact her death has on those who knew her.  Susie sees and explains, but strangely, is not compelled to judge from her point of view. She watches as the tragedy takes its toll on her family, as her boyfriend seeks out a new companion, and her killer eludes the police.  <br /> Alice Sebold's novel explores \\"The Sixth Sense\\" notion that the dead are among us, longing to be acknowledged and loved again, longing for basic human experiences. But that strand is secondary to the story of the emotional dismemberment of the family left behind.  The Lovely Bones is a gently told tale of suspense that will have a lingering effect on any reader. <br />  <br />
B003Y5H542|2|I got this movie because my 5 year old said it was the best movie ever.  His grandparents had taken him to see it so I figured ok, I'll buy it.  We ordered a pizza, had a picnic in the living room to watch this movie for family night with our 5 and 2 year old.  Let me tell you, about 20 minutes into the movie my husband and I were ready to turn this thing off.  My two year old didn't even make it this far as she said it was \\"scary\\".  We couldn't stand to continue watching this movie, but our 5 year old was glued to the tv so we just let it play out.  I can't even remember what I did to kill the time it took for this movie to finally end, but it was a good 1 1/2 to 2 hours of my life wasted along with my money for buying it.  I'm not really sure what the movie was actually about, I'm not even sure if it's supposed to be a kids movie or not because there seemed to be some cussing and violence in it.  Now I'm not one of those parents that sheild their children from anything and everything with a hint of violence and I'll admit that they probably hear more cussing in everyday life than in the movie, but don't buy this movie thinking it might be a cute kid movie, because it is far from it.  If this movie was done with real actors and not produced into cartoon characters I would not let my kids watch it.  They've never touched the movie again, and we probably never will.
B001FB55HG|2|John Connor's character, and the entire movie, is built around the idea that human compassion and love is what makes us better than the machines.  The hybrid Terminator played by Sam Worthington saves John Connor and Kyle Reese from death.  John Connor is mortally wounded and needs a heart.  The hybrid Terminator has a human heart, and offers it to John Connor.  Connor accepts the heart, presumably leading to the death of the hybrid.  This one scene ruined the entire movie for me, and made a lie out of John Connor's entire ethos.  The John Connor I know would not take the life of another human to save his own.    The movie lacked the nerve racking suspense of the first two that left you exhausted.  It was very predictable, and most of the movie I felt like I was watching Transformers 3, not Terminator 4.  The director McG just does not get the Terminator Universe.  I hope he Will Not be Back.
B000002GGU|5|Love it.  I also had the cassette when it came out, and now 30 years later I finally own the cd.  I am a big fan, and always wanted to have this cd to play in my car.  The cd sounds clear and great.  Love the music.  Even though the world has moved on to electronic downloading there is nothing like popping this into your car and singing along with a truly talented singer/songwriter and truly a bad ass.
B0000640S2|5|This is the best of all the Rambo series.
1400064627|5|the movie was shipped quickly, arrived in perfect condition as expected and was quite pleased overall.
B002DD67XG|5|Great music by a great artist.
B000UPSKO8|1|Appalling camera work and direction is an insult to the musicians, singers and the music. Completely insensitive to the art of singing. You don't get to watch a singer complete a phrase or enjoy their acting. Possibly the worst purchase I have ever made.
B004GJDQT8|5|I buy everything I see
B004XUMMFE|5|I did have trouble streaming to my computer. The first one streamed perfectly. While I was watching the 2nd episode, my computer shut down unexpectedly.  I have still not been able to stream to my laptop since then.  However, the Wii installation was easy, and watching that way works well.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Don't be fooled thinking this is a mindless game!! Strategy is everything here. I now see candy in people's faces, in my food... totally addictive. Can't live without it!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Very fun I don't know about the &quot;not flappy birds&quot; but who cares ..... must get back to the game
B00821OX98|5|I had never even heard of this show until I saw it on Amazon. My husband is the syfy nut in our household so he found it. I am so glad he did.
B00004TRD8|5|good flick
B004MC8CA2|4|Very good, I like to compare different versions.
B000001E8S|4|U2 and Brian Eno have enjoyed one of popular music's most artistically and commercially successful partnerships for two decades running, but prior to - and after - this unusual 1995 outing, their association has basically been one of band and producer. On ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACKS 1, however, a de facto new entity, Passengers, was formed by all five men and a slew of guest artists to craft a singular piece of work in the discographies of all involved. <br />   While the concept of ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACKS 1 - an album of film music drawn from films which never existed - may seem a bit silly, it makes sense in the context of its era, a time when \\"hip\\" music - including that of U2 and Brian Eno - was first making serious inroads into the world of movies. Not surprisingly, the aural evidence suggests that the dominant vision here is Eno's; but U2's presence gives the ambient auteur's ideas a welcome dose of drive and accessibility, just as Eno's tweaking has done wonders for U2's sense of sonic detail over the years. <br />   With fourteen tracks representing fourteen fictitious films, ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACKS 1 is inevitably a mixed bag, but the highlights are many. \\"United Colors,\\" one of numerous instrumentals herein, lets the listener know from the outset that this isn't a U2 album in any proper sense, though the beautiful, minimalist \\"Slug\\" wouldn't have sounded out of place on ZOOROPA. Other noteworthy tracks include the Leonard Cohenish \\"Your Blue Room,\\" the dizzying musical chant \\"Always Forever Now\\" and the lovely instrumental \\"Beach Sequence.\\" A show-stopping guest spot from Luciano Pavarotti distinguishes \\"Miss Sarajevo,\\" while \\"Elvis Ate America\\" leavens the proceedings with some (arguably excessive) humor. Anyone listening will undoubtedly prefer some tracks to others, but this is a decidedly easy fifty-eight minutes to sit through overall. <br />   Coming in between U2's two most experimental albums - ZOOROPA and POP - ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACKS 1 offers a welcome breakin the band's otherwise breathless explorations of electronica and studio density in the nineties, while reaffirming its place (and Eno's) at the creative forefront of popular music. The fact that this isn't a U2 album in no way stops it from being a worthy addition to the band's catalogue, as well as an effective challenge to the \\"I hate U2\\" and \\"I hate post-JOSHUA TREE U2\\" contingents. Good stuff!  <br />
B004GJDQT8|1|I liked the convenience of being able to shop from my smartphone while sitting in the doctor's waiting room or waiting in the supermarket line, but I will not be installing this new update to retain that ability. If I really can't wait with a purchase, I will access the desktop site through the Chrome browser on my Droid. Record audio, read contacts, modify, add, or delete the contents of USB storage, send and receive SMS messages, read phone status and identity, and the list goes on, with no explanation of the reasons such an expansive list of permissions is necessary. NOPE. Take this app and shove it, Amazon. I'd give 0 stars if it were possible.
6305428425|5|a good movie
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Sweg.........Is all that I can say therefore I will say no more..........No This game is awesome so u should get it like right now
B006MW3UZW|4|Me and my wife really enjoyed sitting down and watching this. Really get caught up in the characters. Found the war scenes well done, but a little shallow. Everything looks great in blue ray hd.
B00FAPF5U0|3|Fun game, not enough chances only get 5 try's without spending money, and the only draw back is, like all of zings games  you have to beg your friends to help you advance to the next section. That sucks big time!!!
B008B4KVS8|5|Yes bit dated , but it set the standard for the spy game genre the cast is a true mix of the culture at the time
B00FN811SY|5|Excellent!! Free to anybody interested in the Bible and wanting to know what God requires of us. Very easy to use.
B0002KQNJU|2|Saw this as an 11 year old and loved it. Watched it now and was very disappointed. Story line was not good and was very slow. I guess it's true that you can't go home again!
B008XG1X18|2|It's not as user friendly as the one on my iPhone or iPad or even on the computer. Don't think ill use it much.
158270208X|5|The book came on time and was is excellent shape. No damages and it was everything it said it would be.
1628600543|5|I'm still reading but I absolutely love this book. I alreadyou had some training in health and nutriton but they have written this book in a way that anyone can understand!
0060919760|5|It is an excellent, although dated, self help book on anger, however, it kind of also puts one to sleep with its constant pop psychology. I  made a mistake and really should have gotten Dr. Dyer's Pulling your own Strings self help as that is the book I had in mind. Oh! Well! Another time.
B000JMLFLW|5|Oh Mr.Darcy! My absolute favorite book.
B00AZRBLHO|5|I have been in IT for years and this book resonated with me.It is a good story and it reveals the true nature of life as an executive in a high profile software company. Kudos!
B0002Z1EG2|5|Great Stuff!!!
B00004T8RK|5|Binaural does not dissapoint. In my opinion this is Pearl Jam's best work since VS. The album starts out rocking then gets kind of a spacey feel to it. Then goes in between the two. Easy on the ears from start to finish.  Buy it today! You won't regret it. It's an album you won't &quot;soon  forget&quot;.
B006H4DBA4|4|a very good read gave me a few laughs and enjoyed the book would recommend to anyone.<br />it lets you escape and have a good read
B000001Y5X|5|This was the very last Manson CD i bought, which i now consider a good thing  becuase if i would have gotten this first, all of his other work would have paled in comparason.  Oddly enough, this album retains a certian rough, unpolished, feel to it, becuase it was manson's first CD, but if you listen to him, he sounds like an old rock star coming back ten years after his heyday to dish out more music.  So in the end, it turns out sounding immature but at the same time, as if our little freind here knows damn well what hes doing.  Obviously i find this to be his best work, becuase it was his only rock album, and it sounded so out of place in the time it was made.  Now i love all of his other stuff, dont get me wrong.  But its obvious this could be the crap out of Golden AGe of Grotesque, with its weak porno lyrics, distorted vocals, and cheerleaders.   And when he didnt have the millions that he has now, the arch dandy didnt need stage props and flashy outfits to win over a crowd.   <br />Obviously this CD has tons of metaphors that will go over most of the heads of ignorant americans.  Such as 'Get Your Gunn,' which, although the bad connotations of the title, actually is referring to the killing of the abortion doctor, Doctor Gunn.  The songs main point is that killing abortion doctors doesnt make you pro-life.  And while 'Cake and Sodomy' may sound like a dirty excuse of a song, its a statement about the hypocracy of America.   'Wrapped in Plastic' asks us the maddening question 'does the plastic on the couch keep the dirt out, or does it keep it in?.'  And then theres 'lunchbox,' the most ironic track on portriat, for the lyrics 'i want to grow up, i want to a big rock and roll star' well, it happened.  But strangely enough, this track's main riff sounds musically familiar to that of Golden Age Of Grotesque's 'Ka-Boom Ka-Boom' execpt the lyrics are the exact oppasite.  Listen, youll hear it. And of course one of my favorites 'Dogma' thats all about religious persicution, and then 'Misery Machine' a spoof on a scooby doo song, which explains why i found it sort of familiar. <br />Not only does this album pack a painfull punch on the American way of life, it intoxicates you with guitar solos (something you wont find in ANY of his other CDs besides the remix ep...)and his crashing vocals, and will no doubt leave you doing air guitars all the while sitting there in deep thought. <br />For all you  people that act like this music is corruptive and sick, well i have two things to say: <br />1.) All hes doing is telling the truth, and you have no room to hate someone for that becuase chances are you watch the news and you watch those images of soldiers getting their heads cut off becuase, hey! its the news! <br />2.)If your morals are so strong and youve done such a good job raising your children, than you why are you so easily shaken by one man?  If you truely belived in the thigns you belive and teach than none of this would even scare you.
B000H7JD4K|4|Much better than last 2 since reforming with Dickinson. A few songs drag out a little long, but i like the straight forward, clean production. No surprises (no synths, effects), which is a good thing. They seem to have gotten their focus back on this release. Maybe they can trim it down a little more, but i am happy. The DVD is pretty cool as well. Good value.
B00AREIAI8|5|Great for animal lover<br />My daughter love this game I played it first and even I got a little into it nice...
B00G6ZTM3Y|3|My kids love this game and love playing with their cousins but  they have the updated version and now they can't go into each other world's.  Amazon won't update their version!!!  So amazon do your part and update the app!!!!!
B000000JO3|5|Un trs bonne album... La franchise des textes est l et le Hard Core aussi!
B002BU0DPE|5|I got these so I could play games while not disturbing my room mate.  I wish I had them a long time ago.  It's amazing how big of a difference they make in game play.  You hear things you would never pick up even with an amazing surround sound system.  You are able to pick up on sounds from people walking around in a game from far away and know exactly where they are relative to you.  The sound quality is phenomenal.  They have a really deep, rich sound with bass control.  The headset has an \\"expander\\" function that I don't personally use.  The voice quality is amazing.  A huge step up from using a bluetooth headset.  And all of my friends say that I sound way better.  The only real problem I have is that the volume controls are really touchy.  When I clip the controls to my shirt, I sometimes will hit the volume knob and turn down the volume all the way down with my sleeve.  That being said, I was able to adjust where I put it and dont do it nearly as often after having it a couple of days.      Since I have these plugged into the outgoing plugs of my tv rather than having the PS3 signal pass through, I am also able to watch movies and television which is also nice.    Highly recommended headset.
B00FJ3CK2Y|5|wow, amazing book, funny, makes you realize that sometimes everything is meant to be and everything happens for a reason. Just loved the narration and they way it flows all the way.
B005ERIRZE|5|This is one of those rare books which I happened to \\"bump into it\\" by mistake and which is so far making a deep and profound impact in my life. It has provided a deep understanding of many, if not all, of my past behavior and mistakes in terms of desires, lack of control, obsessions, obesity, addictions, etc.  This book couldn't have come into my life at a more auspicious time. I'm currently on the long  and difficult process of spiritual and mental transformation. This gem of a book  provides the physiological, neurological, scientific ( evidence based ) and secular explanations that coupled with the spiritual ( from other sources and not from this book) completes the whole process.<br />If you have struggled with addiction, eating disorders, gambling, smoking, spending too much, lack of control in your life, hoarding, etc; if you feel a slave to your smartphone, your job, food, alcohol, relationships (bad ones), etc then this book will open your eyes and provide you with tools to help you regain control and put your lives and your minds in order.
B001I45UFC|5|We read this as a family book.  What a wonderful fantastic adventure.  I wish I had a wardrobe like that!
B00IR3W52S|5|Every album keeps getting better and better.  Love Coldplay. Always on the forefront of music. Whether u want to relax or get pumped this is a must listen.
B003EY7IRC|5|Read it! Loved this series. I couldn't wait for books at library and decided to purchase the last two.<br />Will be looking for more by Karen Marie Moning.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is so freakin awesome. Absolutely love it! Would recommend it to anyone! If you ever needed a fun thing to do this is it!
B00AECGQF2|5|My 18 month old daughter likes to play this game in short stints as does my 5 year old nephew.  There are lots of options so kids of different ages can approach it different.  It's a nice little occupier if you want something to keep their attention for 10 minutes at a time.
B000W3YLH8|3|Film fans and students will know the name Carl Theodore Dryer for his beautiful film 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' which set an unprecedented standard in film both in terms of performance but most importantly in terms of composition.    It would be difficult to say 'Vampyr' is far from the cinematographic genius that was Joan of Arc.  The film is peppered with Dryer's dynamic close up shots, especially toward the end of the film.  And foretelling of later Kubrick films, Dryer exploits some magnificent tracking shots to help build the eerie dreamlike quality of the piece.    The story itself left me scratching my head, and I'm sure the film wasn't aided by the fact that only 1/3rd of the dialogue has subtitles (If you speak German you've got a leg up).  The intertitles appear to be in tact but from what I have researched about the state of the film, this was likely a composite of two different cuts of the film (likely the French and German).  The subtitles themselves were a bit too large and obscure some of the frame but this was likely to cover up existing subtitles that were on the print.    Generally, if you're in to Carl Dryer's work check this film out, the cinematography and some of the camera tricks are quite interesting though not as thoroughly impressive as Joan of Arc.  Otherwise this is not terribly noteworthy as an early sound film and the design here has moved away from the more dynamic German Expressionist films.
B00VFTCGES|4|Very good movie
B00B2V66VS|4|Great new temple run game with way better graphics! I like that you can upgrade to new characters dont miss this one if you are a fan of the first temple run.
B0000009RX|1|I don't get weird for the sake of weird, I don't get people who hate the Beatles for being too good at what they did, and apparently I don't get Zappa. This really does sound dated. Basically a hand full of musicians were still taken by the novelty of a modern (relatively for \\"68) recording studio. Fake phone conversations, meaningless jibber spoken into a mic (with lots of echo, that makes it so much more intriguing). Obviosly the cover and the eclectic collection of music (when there was a bit) was a spoof of the Beatles. Okay, so it's a spoof. What about it? It's kinda like watching a comedy spoofing another movie for not being funny and forgetting to be funny itself. Basically, if your in one of those hip circles who insists that Sgt. Peppers isn't a great album (which it is) simply because it is overrated (which it may be) than you might possibly find this album amusing.
B0051ANPZQ|5|It was a wonder! Every part of the book was awesome. Sometimes it made you sad others it made you happy! I love this book!!!!
B005LAIHIQ|2|They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and...oh, that's another crazy horror TV family. Dark Shadows has managed to achieve some measure of cult status thanks to its quirky, macabre premise, more so than for any claim to being good. It was unique at least, as fairly serious goth soap operas featuring monsters and parallel universes are kinda hard to come by nowadays. You won't have to look hard to find the yearly Dark Shadows Festival, and the show has been attempted as a remake on more than one occasion. They all failed. Let's face it, remaking a series that seems to defy typical genre conventions is a tough act. Since most people have no clue what the heck Dark Shadows was, and a TV series is a proven failure, what's the best way to make use of this niche property? Make a movie out of it.<br /><br />Unfortunately that seems to be the only consideration at play in this tired and disappointing version of Dark Shadows, made even worse by the presence of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, who on paper would seem to be the perfect fit. Over the years, Burton has strayed further away from original material, shutting off much of his creative genius in order to bring to life the vision of others, and this would be the best evidence that all those years away have caused him to lose his touch. The same goes for Depp, who in his eighth collaboration(!!!) with Burton has fallen into the same comfortable formula as him. Burton appears perfectly happy to apply his talents to substandard, franchise friendly material. Depp, who has spent more time playing goofball characters than actual human beings, has reached the point where it looks as if he's not even trying anymore.<br /><br />This Dark Shadows bears many of the hallmarks of the original series, Burton-ized for maximum marketability. That's not to say that making an obviously mainstream film is a bad thing. It's just that what made Burton so special is that he could do it without it ever feeling like he was compromising his artistic vision. Those days, sadly, are gone, traded in for half-hearted love triangles and lazy culture clash jokes sprinkled with spiffy 1970s rock tunes. The film begins promisingly in 1760, where the Collins clan have uprooted themselves and moved to Maine, where they began a thriving seafood company that powers the entire town's economy. They're so beloved that the town actually becomes known as Collinsport, but that's about where all the good cheer ends. Young Barnabas Collins(Depp) has become the object of desire of their servant girl, Angelique(Eva Green), and he has given in to passion with her on numerous occasions, even though he has found true love with the beautiful Josette(Bella Heathcote). When Barnabas tries to break things off with Angelique, she gets revenge by casting a murderous spell on Josette, destroying the Collins family, and cursing Barnabas as a vampire. Oh, and then she has him buried alive.<br /><br />Fast forward a couple of hundred years to 1972, and the Collins family is still feeling the effects of Angelique's curse. The once stately Collins Manor has fallen into disarray, broken and disheveled. The family business is in tatters, with the surviving Angelique using the years to take over the seafood industry for herself, sending the Collins' into ruin. All that remains of the family are a handful of heirs with secrets and quirks galore: the regal matriarch, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard(Michelle Pfeiffer); her insufferable, gold-digging brother(Johnny Lee Miller); the rebellious teenage daughter, Carolyn(Chloe Moretz); and the troubled 10-year old son, David(Gully McGrath). Things begin to turn around with the arrival of Victoria Winters(Heathcote again) as the new governess, who happens to be the spitting image of Josette. When Barnabas is accidentally unearthed from his grave(and promptly slaughters everyone nearby), he rejoins the family and sets out to restore them to their greater glory.<br /><br />Of course it won't be easy, especially when Barnabas quickly falls for Victoria, and she seems drawn mysteriously to him. Like a replay from their youth, Angelique jealously does everything in her power to steal Barnabas away, inciting a rivalry between her and the Collins clan that threatens to consume the town. What could have been a hilarious and spirited war between supernatural foes, mixed with Burton's freakish flair for the dramatic, turns out to be a one-note affair. Much of the humor derives for Barnabas's inability to adapt to modern times, spazzing out over the \\"tiny songstress\\" singing on the television. He's generally lost in the cultural freedom of the time period, although he seems to have the \\"free love\\" ideal down pretty well. Burton, along with horror novelist turned screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith(Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter), mine the fish out of water humor for all it's worth. They're actually quite funny for awhile, but like most of Depp's impersonations they wear thin really quick. It doesn't help that the rest of the Collins clan are basically ignored, seen only when reacting to some misstep Barnabas has made. Moretz, a fantastic and mature young actress is badly miscast as Carolyn, a vampy bit of jailbait with a snotty attitude and great \\"birthing hips\\". Not even Helena Bonham Carter, such a staple and a highlight of many Burton movies, has much to do here as the family psychiatrist, Dr. Julia Hoffman. The most interesting thing about her, other than the momentary \\"fling\\" she has with the over-sexed Barnabas, is her blazing scarlet hair. Only Eva Green's busty and sinful performance as Angelique has any hint of life to it. She can curse me anytime she wants. We just aren't given much of a reason to care about anybody, and that includes Barnabas.<br /><br />The fundamental problem is the inability to blend the show's campy, soap opera elements with Burton's rather specific sort of black comedy. The tone is all over the map, from dark and rather vicious, to downright silly. Sometimes this can be a good thing, and Burton has shown many times he can usually find a way to make these elements work in perfect harmony. He never pulls it off here, though, and a big part of the problem is Graham-Smith's haphazard writing. Having read both of his popular, genre mash-up novels, that inconsistency is a recurring theme. He's a writer with a lot of cool ideas but little clue how to pull them off. That fits what happens to Dark Shadows to a tee. There's so much potential here, from the concept to the cast, that it's aggravating to sit and watch it go absolutely nowhere. At least it looks like a Burton film. He certainly hasn't lost his touch for art and production design.<br /><br />Burton and Depp have stated in the past how they were huge fans of theTV series, and it's mainly due to them that this film exists. They must've only really enjoyed the occasional episode or two, because it quickly becomes apparent that they have no idea where a Dark Shadows movie should lead. Clocking in at a ponderous 113 minutes, you start to feel every second of it, and the ending indicates the possibility of sequels. Rather than going in that direction, maybe Burton and Depp should just get together and pop in the Blu-Rays for a weekend marathon.ally when Barnabas quickly falls for Victoria, and she seems drawn mysteriously to him.

B007EECSFA|5|Very well written......and good suspense.  The reader gets &#34;into&#34; the three main characters....and wants to know what will happen to each.  Their stories were interwoven.......and the ending really not anticipated.  I'll look for other books by Morton......
B00JVZ0DQG|1|This app doesn't self update. And doing it manually is complicated. Sometimes you lose everything and end up back at the beginning. Reporting the problem just gets ignored. Not worth the effort just to lose it all and get ignored.
B004K8WPUQ|1|I own over $300k worth of gear, I have bought everything in the camera lighting grip and audio world you can think of.<br /><br />This mic, without a doubt is in the top 3 WORST pieces of equipment I have ever bought. Anyone who rates this more than 1 star has not actually used it, or is an novice DSLR shooter.<br /><br />The sound is crap, tinny and souless. The mounts are complete joke and break constantly or come undone. Any time a manufacturer sends extra parts (little baggie of extra rubber band mounts) to try to head off complaints, you know you have a piece of dogcrap. The mounts are almost impossible to get back on and they are so thing they barely suspend the mic and break constantly.<br /><br />This thing is built like a cheap Chew toy. Its &#34;dead cat&#34; wind screen is worth about what a dead cat is worth. over all i think the build quality is horrible and a person would be WAY better off buying a proper mic and a 1/4-20 hotshoe adapter with a proper suspension mount.<br /><br />cant believe I spent money on this. Anyone want to buy it?
B00B4VI8MQ|5|Great game.  Interesting puzzles that are different than some games of this type.  Very spooky atmosphere.  It is great to relax to,  Not too hard and not too easy.  Final words......luv it, keep those great games coming G5.  Plus ,  I really like getting to try the game before you purchase it.  If u don't like it u just don't buy it.:-) :-)
B00MI1X58S|5|The movie was great, dont listen to anybody giving it bad reviews, they clearly dont know the storyline. It was a great film, with great action scenes and a great storyline. Everything was perfect, the only thing that I didnt like, was that they took to long to show the turtles. But besides that, the movie was great. Id watch it 10 more times!
B0053O89WY|5|New item received in perfect condition. Thank you!
B006LSZECO|3|Dull at the begining.<br />Well developed and catching in the middle.<br />Interesting end
B006BGZJJ4|4|Works as expected. I would have been surprised and indeed disappointed if this cable had not done what was advertised.
B00JRAYXIE|5|Loved this game, have played all the artifex mundi games and this certainly didn't disappoint me, great story, great graphics, great little mini puzzles. Well worth the money in my opinion. Now please create some more artifex mundi !!!
B00BJA2VFW|5|I love this game and I get so wrapped up in it that time flies! Great game that gets harder as you play more levels.
B00QW8TYWO|4|I think this app is really good. I do think that it is also a time consumer. Play if you are extremely board
B003B02OOG|5|Great stories! I laughed and cried.
B002SSUQFG|5|very good
B0051UP5NQ|5|useful alternative for Microsoft office! love being able to use them on my fire instead of my pro, especially excel! great for personal trainers as myself, makes keeping track of progress that much easier and accessible!
B001NLKWLW|5|While I read this book a couple of years ago, it's still one that stays with me.  I absolutely loved the way the author intertwined the children's stories and the plot.  I couldn't put this book down- it was such a great one to get lost in!
B0020EK4QY|5|One of Harrison Ford's best! And I guarantee you'll find any excuse to say &#34;Get off my plane&#34; after you see it!
B000KJT8IG|5|Movie never gets old!
B00A6VAW9W|5|Tonight I had my first chance to sit and listen to the new Blue Sky Riders’ CD Finally Home.  I have read several rave reviews, and was expecting quite a bit.  It blew me away.  I have always been a Kenny Loggins fan and I through the little samples I have heard I knew love both Gary Burr’s & Georgia Middleman’s voice.  Everything the reviews said was true.  Musically it is amazing.  The lyrics are insightful and mirror much of my journey the last year or so.  Overriding all the critical elements that might be included in a review written by head (which all are wonderful) is the reaction of my heart.  This album has me grinning.  It makes my heart happy.  I may decide on a favorite song or two, but right now it is simple a joy to listen to the whole album…over and over and over……
B0001VWP8I|5|Think this time Anastacia hitted a homerun! The best album I've ever heard! It is a real joy to listen to this music.
B00MELK918|4|I loved this series and could not wait for number 5.  Without spoiling anything I was so disappointed in the ending.  I have loved all of Jeffrey Archer's books, starting with Not A Penny More, Not a Penny Less .  I think it is time to bring the Clifton Chronicles to an end.
B000002HEP|5|After purchasing \\"Blues for the Red Sun\\", Kyuss' second album, they have been without question my favorite band of all time. While Kyuss was never a very radio-friendly band, their work is simply unmatched. If you listen to a Kyuss album and are searching for that catchy hook that your typical radio band has, forget it. Kyuss' music is all about feeling and emotion. It's not music that you can just throw in your CD player while you are busy doing other things. Kyuss needs to be appreciated and taken in. If you wish to fully experience Kyuss, sit in a dark room with your headphones on, close your eyes, and be blown away. Although the music carries the stoner rock label and does have a psycadelic feel, you don't need any kind of a buzz to enjoy Kyuss. The MUSIC is the drug. \\"Welcome to Sky Valley\\" is an absolutely excellent piece of work. However, it's only a fraction of the Kyuss experience. I don't recommend buying \\"Welcome to Sky Valley.\\" I recommend buying EVERY album this band has recorded. Although I enjoy their first record, \\"Wretch\\", it truthfully comes nowhere near their later work. It's really cool to see the band progress and mature musically with each record. I was crushed when this band broke up and my only hope is that someday they join forces again to create the best music ever made.
B006DJ2JSI|4|It's a dictionary....
B000H6SXMY|5|Friends has been recognized as a great series for a long time.  One thing I was afraid, by looking at the product pictures, that there was only 6 seasons.  Because they have the boxes designed based on the 6 stars/Characters.  They have broken the seasons down into these six character boxes.   I have not been able to look through this 100% but 90% that I have looked at has been no different from purchasing the individual seasons.  If you have a choice buy the box set because it will be cheaper, but if you already have several seasons just finish out your collection.
B00J2VSS0C|5|Very fun. Keeps you playing all day long.
0783225849|5|My cousin John was visiting me at my home and he expressed how he woud like to see PSYCHO again.  So I ordered the dvd but when it first arrived, I saw it was a makeover with different people, so I ordered the original.  Both John and I enjoyed watching it a.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|So poignant. Dean, so real! I love the last line, &#34;you're not going to get a happily ever after, you're just going to get me.&#34;<br /><br />Wow! Is all I can say
B00GN76K4Y|3|This app is good but needs improvement. I play on IPad as well and the IPad version is much better. Needs mutiplayer. Otherwise it is good.
B00881VLCE|5|The pictures are so clear and beautiful and it has different size pieces you can choose from so it's not so extremely tiny.
B009NPKTN6|2|Considering the cast... this could've been A LOT better.  I think the problem is that the main characters of this BOMB were either relatively unknown, or actors with very little experience.  Tom Cruise was hilarious.. and Catherine Zeta-Jones was great (as always).  But the rest of the cast was completely forgettable.  Julianne needs to stick to what she's good at... dancing.
0385338082|4|This book is an interesting, and very quick read.  It's completely predictable, and some of the situations that Emma gets herself into are a bit over the top, but all and all it's a good read, and it will make you laugh.  Not as good as Shopoholic though I must say!
B00IIOFVYA|4|Nice way to spend a few hours
B007SYWFRM|5|fun and relaxing. very nice graphics.  all in all, a great game.  I have not purchased acorns and don't need to.
B00JB3MVCW|3|I liked it ... but there were too many content changes from the Biblical story to give it 4 or 5 stars.<br /><br />I don't mind 'filling in the blanks between the lines' with creativity, but outright changes, while interesting, takes away a sense of reality.
B00DR0PDNE|5|It is a great product
B002QE3CTY|5|Amazing! This book was just as good as the hunger games. I am very excited to start the next book in the series and see what happened. I want the kids to get out free more than anything!
B00IMYZOBQ|1|Arghhhhhhhhhhhhh<br />Yes great special effects but the story line, plot, whatever was so so badddd<br />Sandra should have bought it several times instead she is Capt Kirk<br />No way
1628600543|5|If you plan on starting the Whole30 way of life, this is the proverbial Bible.  Have questions, unsure or on the fence.  BUY THIS BOOK!  It is chock full of information and explanations. It all really does start with food.
0385504209|3|don't expect to care about what happens to any of the characters.  Brown does not spend any time on character examination; you know little about each character's history and care even less. The book is a well constructed mystery, however; the plot moves along so quickly its reminiscent of a Hollywood movie and frankly, could have almost been written as a screeplay. In addition, it appears that some of Brown's research is flawed.  The scariest part of this book is knowing, absolutely, that some non-Christians will believe it to be based on fact which it absolutely is not....
B00BSBR9N6|3|I was looking for something different and fun to read and this was it! A reverse My Fair Lady. Lots of fun!
B006KX3GXO|5|Works well on my Kindle HDX.
B000063DI8|4|This album is a very solid record. <br />Its just....a continuing change in their career. <br />If anyone listens to all of the albums straight in order (excluding  live albums and greatest hits) you finish up Powerslave (one of their heaviest albums) and you hit Somehwere In Time...you sit there and look at your cd player and say \\"what the heck?? this sucks!\\" But if you listen to it any other time you realize how awesome and incredible it is. <br />This album, like a lot of Maiden albums, just flows very differently from ones that came before, and after. <br />Its a very wonderful album, just give it a chance. <br /> <br />Oh...and...on the enhanced version of the album, the cover art is changed, yes, but I think the actual disc's art is the original album cover. (with the fat man with the lantern being strangled)
B002SF9YNO|5|love this movie.alot of orginal japanese humor and unexpected laughs.The music is wounderful .enjoyed it some bought the cd.funny and touching.
B00DRPVE3M|4|_Just like the card game tho no shuffling required. Only complaint is the amount of games u can play in a row. To get &quot; gold coins&quot;  for playing requires multiple log ins daily plus leveling up. I wish the payouts were better but fun for a short while. It is free tho and some rounds get tough competition. Might as well try it out__
B009U9S6FI|5|Incredible story. Frankel tells the story with incredible insight. Exceptionally thought provoking.
B00HY7VU60|5|Loved this movie
B0032Y8XH8|5|I have never rated or reviewed anything; I leave that to others. But, this CD is too good to not contribute what little I can.  I'm a little old lady, firmly fixed in classical and old folk music.  I plunked this CD in my car stereo, and promptly got goose bumps, it is so good!  The vocal and instrumental harmonies are flawless, and frankly, just beautiful.  The ringing banjo is an addition you rarely hear on music in this country, and what an addition it is!  I'd recommend this album to anyone I know. It's good enough to cross all lines.  Take it from me, I've been around a long time!    Sue May
B0007MWZEK|5|Great sweeper. I highly recommend. It's works on both hardwood and throw rugs.
B000Q9ISSQ|5|A must read travelogue that is extremely hilarious. Takes you through entire Australia, makes you feel as though you visited the place.
B00L9B7IKE|5|One of those books you finish but wish you hadn't read it so fast.  Mainly because it was so entertaining!
B00W3V83QW|5|very addicting.
0525948023|1|Simply enough, Tolle's book is so attractive and popular because it removes the distractng reminder of a God who loves us enough to die for us, but who also loves us too much to acquiesce when we deliberately choose to spend Eternity apart from Him. Follow Tolle's philosophy and you'll break the second commandment; namely, you'll make a god in your own image (yours!) God wants for us what Tolle's book supposedly offers, but He is the only one who can get us there.

B0013FSL3E|4|[[ASIN:B0013FSL3E Wall-E (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)]]<br /><br />Being a big kid at heart, I decided to buy 'Wall E' based on the success of the previous productions from Pixar.<br /><br />I had been warned of the slow, 'silent' first scene, which turned out to be a unique experience. A nice way to introduce this endearing robot of the future. Just had to love Wall E's little mate, the cockroach! it wasn't hard to have immediate empathy with Wall E, as I found him to be a cute mechanical 'ugly duckling' who exuded love and craved companionship.<br /><br />Naturally the underlying theme of waste dumping, conservation and human lack of exercise and commitment, add to the simple 'Romeo & Juliet' love story between two robots who have humanoid feelings. I enjoyed the tale and had a few good laughs, in spite of the darker undertones of the tale referring to the possible 'end of civilization' because of lazy humanity.<br /><br />A nice flight of fantasy, and sci-fi, mixed together with a nice romance. A good evening's entertainment.<br /><br />A delightful film, and great value, with the fun add-ons included in the DVD. if you have a universal DVD player, then you can play this on your DVD in Australia (as we did)or in the UK etc.<br /><br />Love you Wall E!

B003L77G06|5|Great enterntainment and same laughing as season 1. Perfect 20min break episodes. If you like season1, you gotta try this season2.
B001HDWKMA|4|I listened to all of the sampler files for the album and felt everything sounded wuite nice.  this is a soulful album with softer sounds of lament and not much not the driving angst of songs like &#34;How Come&#34; off his first album.  It makes good ambiance music for work or reading.  Ray is great and this makes 3 of his albums that I have.  Cheers,
B0040HO01Y|5|I have watched many BBC series on PBS. Never saw this one. I am hooked.<br />Can't wait to see what happens in Seasons 2,3,& 4. Downton Abbey fans<br />will recognize the father in this series!

B000002G7E|4|It's easy to see why this album didn't sell much when released.  It's not that audiences were so unsophisticated at the time (they weren't) and many were amenable to giving experimental music a chance.  Most people didn't know about VU at the time.  The record was released before the heyday of underground FM radio, and, given the nature of their music, they weren't going to get much AM radio play.  But, many who heard this album may have dismissed it as noisy and pretentious [material].  And, that's not a completely unfair criticism!<br />Overall, this is the weakest of the Velvet's four studio albums with the least endearing set of music.  Much of it just doesn't stand the test of time.  White Light/White Heat is great of course but it's very short and there are better versions to be heard.  I Heard Her Call My Name is fun for awhile before it completely disintigrates into a noise fest.  The psycho art rockabilly style of the song makes it sound something like the Legendary Stardust Cowboy might have done had he been a New Yorker instead of a Texan.  One reviewer here likens this release to the album equivalent of Plan 9 from Outer Space.  That's funny.  An appreciation for that type of perspective may be the ticket to really enjoying this record.<br />The true high point of this album is the 17 minute dirge, Sister Ray, and this version is better than other ones I have heard.  ...  The whole song gives the feel of a slow moving train wreck.   It chugs steadily ahead while assaulting the ears of the witnesses in its path.  All the while Lou Reed chants the sleazy lyrics ...  There's a point late in the song when the various bandmembers seem to be trying to outduel each other as purveyors of noise and obnoxiousness but Cale's organ seems to win out in a moment of sheer noisy bliss when you want to grab your skull and scream, \\"NO! NO MORE!\\"<br />Geeze, I think I'll have to throw this one again sometime soon.<br />P.S.  The box set of this disk includes lots of othersongs from the period of this album. Most of them are far more accessible, conventional, and likeable than the music on White Light White Heat.  A true gem from this period, Hey Mr. Rain, is included in that bunch.
B0089EHWQE|5|I really liked the story and thought it was well written.  Kept me interested- easy read.
B004DLPXAO|5|I love this app. lots of books. easy to read. great free books to download. I would recommend this app to everyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Love these books and movies!  Highly recommended!
B00JOT3HQ2|3|It's asome I love it. I play it all the time ever sins I got it
1101946342|5|Loved this book. So much better than fifty shades of grey. Hope she does the next 2 books from Christian's perspective.
B00132D808|5|Honestly, I like emo. But I like that Panic didn't make a follow-up that sounded like a Fallout Boy twin. Everyone keys in on The Beatle's influence but good music is good music. If you're looking for another Fever album, look elsewhere. Track 4 is the standout for me. Solid lyrics, my hats off to poetic genius.
0316282243|5|A fun and informative book. Great must have for any mlp fan to add to your collection
0785156593|5|greatest book ever made
6305313687|5|Have you ever watched a movie where you begin to think if the actor's real personality is actually like the personality of his character??  Well my friends, that is the feeling that this movie delivers.    Edward Norton is a highly underrated actor who delivers a mind blowing performance in this film.  The actors performance is so real, it's actually kind of hard to believe that they are NOT truly racists.      The characters in this movie portray what neo nazism in the real world is really like.  They have no mercy and no remorse for the actions they commit, and at one point, one action gets Norton thrown in jail.  While in jail he realizes that he could get along with all races, and that he could be friends and not fiends with everone.  The problem is, while he was in jail, his little brother was out getting himself involved with the nazis, and so a whole bunch of flashbacks happen in Norton's head while he's in jail.    Overall, this is one of the saddest but yet most disgusting movies I've ever seen, and it even brought me to tears at the end of the movie (only other movie that did that to me was \\"Armageddon\\".  American History X is an epic movie to share with the ADULTS of the family, because this movie is VERY, VERY VILE!  = why it wasn't in theaters.  But, it changed the way I watched movies forever, and it sure gave me a higher perspective on neo nazism.  It's a must have, buy it now!    John
B00L9B7IKE|3|Everyone raves about this book, so I bought it.  It's OK.  I found it to be overly repetitive, and unbalanced in that we know lots about the main character, and not enough about everyone else.  I never bonded with her, and so found it hard to maintain my interest in her obsessions.  (Enough, already!)  I was relieved when the story came to an end and I could move on.
B009QU9X44|5|fantastic
B00003CXCT|5|The one and only classic STAR WARS! This is quite possibly the greatest movie ever made. Amazingly well written, good special effects, great acting, great costumes, and basically everything about this movie is perfect! I'm not even a Star Wars nut, and I think that this is the greatest movie ever made. I like it more than Lord of the Rings. I think it is more exciting to fly around in space and save the universe, and the lightsaber fights are always impressive and exciting, because you never know who will win. That is more exciting to me than just simply returning a ring to the place that it was made to destroy it and encounter some unforseen obsticles. This movie also keeps your attention from the very first frame, but Lord of the Rings drags in spots. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Lord of the Rings, but I'm being honest here. If you're thinking about buying this, I suggest you do so immediately! This is the GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! Buy it today, and MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!
B000SCHC0Q|5|As I was reading A Thousand Splendid Suns I kept wondering if we would someday look back on Hosseini's books as one of the important events of the beginning of the 21st century, when he brought to the public's attention much of the drama, suffering and need to be hopeful for the people of Afganistan. This book was warm, tragic and gripping and just as important and involving as Kite Runner.
B003WUYRGI|1|This book is so amazing. I just adore dictionaries now. I have seven of them and I keep getting more!!! Wow I LOVE DICTIONARIES!!!!!! GET YOURSELF ONE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5|so fun it is the best since I love horses I think it is a great game and you should get it right now
B00VRYCGLO|2|This has been an exercise in frustration for me.  The tiles are so tiny it's hard to discern the characters on their surfaces. If your vision is perfect you might enjoy this version of Mahjong.
B0000039PW|5|Biggie is real on this album.  His lyrics and flow shows that he was very hungry at the time.  Not too many can come out hard on their first cd.  There is nothing waterdown on this album.  He doesn't talk about bling bling and how many cars he has.  He talks about a typical life in the streets of NY.  So go cop Biggie's best cd.
B00005A3KS|4|Point Break is one of those films that everybody loves, but that nobody actually talks about all that often. It is a film that if you mention it in conversation, everyone else around is bound to say how much they enjoyed it.    The film's two main assets are unexpected ones, in the form of the direction and the script. The direction by Kathryn Bigelow is nothing short of excellent. Her handling of the action and suspense scenes is exciting and riveting. The two sky-diving scenes are brilliant as is the foot chase through the streets (and houses) of the city. The script, by W. Peter Illif, is also very good and the best thing about the film. The plot is multi-layered and has an original relationship between the hero and the villain. The way the story resolves itself and the ultimate resolutions is excellent, by the standards of most Hollywood action films.    This film deserves to be remembered as one of the better actioners of the nineties, not up there with Die Hard 2/3 or Speed, but better than 90% of the action junk made nowadays. At least this film has a plot.
B00B2DSK06|5|Great kid's movie with a sweet theme.
B00HV2KPNW|1|Spoiler alert Hance is evil and only try's to marry Anna so he can be first in line with the throne. Anna's parents die. And Anna's heart gets frozen and need to do a act of true love but it is not a kiss it is stoping Hance from killing Elsa right before she freezes. And Kristof lives with trolls
B00HDMMISA|5|A real page turner!
B00A9X9TIW|5|Bruce Willis was more involved in the action and story line than his previous film. The young Bruce Willis was a great fit and reminiscent of Start Trek young crew picks. His voice even sounded familiar. Had a great ending.
B007SYWFRM|4|I had a Finn and interesting time playing this game.the only problem is that the game slightly pushes you to buy there things. overall I like this game allot.
B009HNDCC4|5|We are a comedy family.  Modern Family is by far the most favorite one in our house.  Not only is if funny, but you can related to the families and their interactions.
B004Y1WCDE|4|If you haven't used PLEX, you should try it. If you have, you already know PLEX is great.<br /><br />Must have for PLEX users, highly recommended.
B004QZ9PLU|4|typical sparks tearjerker ending....but good
B00127RAJY|3|First of all, the workout is great ... when you get to it. The way they made the DVD is such that you have to watch a commercial for Biggest Loser show, then a warning and some other stuff before the workout every time! There's no fast forwarding right to the workouts! I found this highly flawed and annoying... especially when I do the workout every day.    The actual workouts were tough, yet simple. No choreography to learn. For some this may get boring, but if you want a quick, tough, no frills workout... this is great.
B00L9B7IKE|4|I could not put it down.<br />Was a great ending.
B000Y0Q5NM|4|Entertaining.
B0076DELIG|5|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It holds your interest from start to finish. Mr. Connelly truly knows how to write a good mystery!
B008JGSM6G|5|Love Flow Free
B004JN1CW4|4|I read the Maze Runner series of books. I wasn't disappointed. The books kept my interest. I highly recommend the books.
B00FAPF5U0|5|good program, glad it's free, Glad it's free or would not tried it at all. needs some improvement. thank you..
B00BD99JMW|3|This was to be the climax of a great trilogy. I was somewhat disappointed because this volume seemed a little contrived.However, I enjoyed the read.
B004AQR29C|2|if i had saw this in the theaters, i probably would have walked out.  maybe if i liked blood splattering and heads and limbs being chopped off then i would give it three stars.  i love good action movies, but, movies that are bordering on horror and gore (Ninja Assassin comes to mind) are not the way i like my action.
B006LSZECO|5|I love a novel that has lots of twists and turns that you never see coming.  Flynn's brilliant plot kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what could possibly happen next and surprise, it would be nothing you thought might be coming.
095719773X|5|YOU CAN BANK ON `BANKS ON SENTENCE'.<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you're involved professionally in the UK's criminal justice system, whether judge or advocate, `Banks on Sentence' should be added to your professional library as a priority!  Certainly in our experience the vast majority of criminal barristers, solicitors and judges have been found to be in possession of it.<br /><br />Since the first edition appeared in 2003, `Banks on Sentence' has come to be regarded as the leading text on all matters connected with sentencing, quickly revealing its superiority over traditional texts which were often less than reliable and not entirely up to date.<br /><br />As the modern statement on this difficult subject, `Banks on Sentence' continues to make its appearance in any number of criminal courts; `a welcome feature on every Crown Court Bench,' as Rafferty LJ has said.  Writing in the `Views' section which prefaces the first volume HHJ Jeff Blackett refers to it as  `a simple guide to the most complicated areas of sentencing', well indexed and logically laid out.<br /><br />`One book,' he adds, `which I can always bank on.'  This of course is only one example of the kudos these volumes have deservedly received.<br /><br />As this book is updated annually, it's important that you acquire the new edition, particularly this one with its wealth of new material, and rigorous re-editing, re-organising and re-writing, particularly following the commencement of many of the provisions of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and  Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LAPSO).<br /><br />In addition to the new guidelines from the Sentencing Council, there are paragraphs detailing the position prior to and post-LAPSO where the changes are not yet in force.  Also note that the new edition contains a confiscation chapter about twice as long as that in the seventh edition.<br /><br />We should mention here that the author has suggested that if you have a copy of the old edition, you should retain it, as the new edition refers to old cases in previous editions.<br /><br />For those who prefer electronic media, `Banks' is now available as an eBook across a range of devices via the Thomson Reuters ProView platform and as such, completely replicates the print copy, with cross references and massive index of 6,500 entries.  Additionally, updates are frequently posted on the relevant website and there is a regular `sentencing alert' service on email.<br /><br />To facilitate your further research there are well over 130 pages of tables of cases and statutes in the print edition, followed by a table of rules, plus a detailed index at the back of each volume.<br /><br />In short, this is an authoritative work geared to easy navigation and quick reference - an enormous benefit to practitioners under pressure and, we would say, indispensable for those dealing with criminal justice.  The publication date of the two-volume work is 30 April 2013.thor has suggested that if you have a copy of the old edition, you should retain it, as the new edition refers to old cases in previous editions.<br /><br />For those who prefer electronic media, `Banks' is now available as an eBook across a range of devices via the Thomson Reuters ProView platform and as such, completely replicates the print copy, with cross references and massive index of 6,500 entries.

B000ID1J40|5|Having re-watched Sneakers after many years I enjoyed it as much as the first time. Stellar cast makes this a great film. A good mix of humor and suspense. Even tho' the technology is outdated, the fun is not!
B00MIA0KGY|5|I love Barbra.  Anything she sings is wonderful.  She sounds great as always.  I will always buy her music.
0451160916|5|I really liked this book. If you like this book, you will love another King book &quot;The Stand&quot;. Its alot longer, but it is an excellent book that has the same sort of character development as &quot;The Shining&quot;. Read both books!! Danny...its time to take your medicine...
B000O8OTNC|5|This is a wonderful sharpener it works wonders!!!!! I was very very very happy with mine. It sharpened all my knifes beautifully!
B00005JNEI|2|I came in to the movie with an open ear, but I was afraid this movie would be a mess and my fears came true.  Moore is a terrible documentarist.  This movie is erratic, incoherent, and sometimes just plain pointless.  The way Moore uses war images and people crying to \\"move\\" the audience is cringe-worthy.  I thought the one thing that would at least entertain me during this movie were the funny Bush screw-up scenes, but it actually ended up being the middle half of the film where Moore ties in the Bush family's relation to the Saudis.  This was eye-opening material and if Moore had decided to stick this subject for the entire movie and make it a true documentary it could have been something very important.  Instead we are stuck most of the time with Moore's annoying narration and images that tell us nothing new.
B00BD6EJRK|5|the best app I found for editing photos. has many many features
0307959856|3|I wouldn't say I hated this book, but I didn't feel like it had a compelling storyline.  I love Jane Austen and shamefully try to read any knock off I can find because I've read the originals too many times.  This story is fairly true to the characters of Pride and Prejudice, but just doesn't move or make you want to keep reading.  I felt like the \\"mystery\\" was repeated periodically throughout the book in a variety of different locations and closed with a \\"twist\\" that was admittedly not predictable, but also not something you could have figured out based on the information provided in earlier chapters.  It's fine if you are looking for something to read (which I was), but not something that I will be reading again and again.
B008Q09QT2|4|Nicely done. Of course you can predict where the story line's going, but it's quite good.
B000LXQVA4|4|My son enjoy it for a little while and hen gets fussy because he wants out:)
B005K17RU0|3|maps quit working after upgrade. every thing else is great.  easy to use and manipulate.  fix the maps portion and this app gets five stars
B0089EHWQE|5|I enjoyed this much more than I expected.
0891419063|5|Well worth the read. Amazing Marine soldier and American. Well written account of what these young men went through for our country and freedom. Beyond what a person should have to endure. Could read over and over.
B009VIZDLI|5|Very funny, very light a great easy read
B000002LQR|3|Ok three stars cause they could almost transcend their audiemce.<BR>Here's a missed opportunity. These guys are basically good musicians. The problem? They convey a know-it-all pessimism, an emotional armour so thick their funk never swings but stays martial. <br />It's like the bandwidth of their emotion-spectrum is truncated and won't allow them to feel/convey either humor or heartbreak. There can't be any soul without the far-end of feeling. The quote ballad unquote &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; doesn't go nearly far enough.
1423140605|5|I am a huge fan of Rick Riordan and this book just solidified my stake in his talents.  Mark of Athena does a great job introducing some new twists to the Lost Hero universe as well as answering a few unanswered questions.  Plus...I literally got this book in one day with my prime membership.  I could not be happier with this purchase.
B007UPNA6Y|5|great read, enjoyed it I had to read in 9 hrs, typically Lee Child special. Always satisfied after reading about Jack
B000Q6GUTI|5|mark one of the best action heroes !!!
B008NMT684|2|Too many pop up ads to buy the full version.
630542828X|4|Civil Action came Prompt and Sealed. I watched soon after it came. It's a 90s Drama I like.
B001AQTWF2|2|There is no energy in this cd.  What doesn't she have to gain?  Go for it.  This is safe crap.
B00A6PD9I4|5|Loved it!
0761169253|5|awesome read.
0571202284|5|I cannot reccomend this book enough. When I bought this book, I went home and threw away all my other animation books. This is the only one you will ever read. Richard Williams draws on a lifetime of experience working with some of the world's greatest animators and presents his knowledge with a beautifuly designed book. <br />Rather than a dull \\"text book\\" or technical manual feel, this book reads like you are sitting down at a drawing table right next to the author. If you are an animator- or even just interested in the art of animation, do yourself a favor and get this book!
B001D7T6CM|5|I loved them both but especially Denzel Washington in Devil in a Blue Dress because this was made early in Denzel's career and he is so very good in it.  His portrayal of a P.I. back in the 40s was superb. Other cast members also did great job.  Jeff Bridges in Arlington Road also did an outstanding job in this believable story.
B003VANOFY|5|My go-to headset for years. Does the job. Pretty sturdy, but not invincible. Got a free replacement under warranty, no hassle.<br /><br />Logitech is a good brand, even if it's a bit bland. Get it on sale for ~$80, and you won't be disappointed. You won't.<br /><br />I have little/no experience with other headphones. This does not have inflated bass, from what I can tell.<br /><br />The most annoying part is probably the wireless receiver. I feel like they could have done that a lot better. I should take off a star, but I'm too lazy to move my mouse back up there.
0060734191|5|Nix's world is always familiar enough enough to be comfortable but always different enough to feel completely fresh. His style leaves a hint of mystery to his characters and world that carries through the entire trilogy. I bought it becuase a friend told me that it has the most satisfying ending to a trilogy that she'd ever read, and it didn't disappoint.    The only point I disagreed with her on is that Mogget is cooler than the Disreputable Dog. Not by much, but enough.
B009R89HY6|3|I say this book is good because is is on my radar. So I gave it a 3 star.<br />But other wase is is my adea of a good book. The other books on my radar show people's posts!
B001KVZ6HK|5|I'm a huge Marvel and Joss Wheden fan and this movie didn't disappoint! I can't wait for the next one!
B00IIUATDM|4|entertaining, somewhat disturbing, very looooong......
B00JDMY58Y|5|Very happy!
B00PJ5AUCO|5|I made it to night 6 and it is super fun! It's better than the first because no more limited power but I can't wait until the third comes, but this is amazing except golden Freddy kills me whenever without being in my hall or office, that could be fixed later, as well as making it less rare for death mini games less rare and make NIGHT 6 easier.
B000XUBFE2|5|This offers a very different perspective of Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. It is very unique in that it is about a young girl told from the perspective of death, who narrates the book. It is very heartwarming and it will make you laugh and cry. Read it!
B008Z9YGEE|5|thoroughly enjoyd this movie, but the actual cd had couple skip areas in it but am aware not able t retrn due t that kind of defect
B006MW3V6U|5|Best show I have seen in years. This draws you in and keeps you coming back....just like the old Dallas show did. We used to pop popcorn and get comfy with the whole family every time it came on.
B004UPANGM|5|Evil Dead 1 didn't turn out to be the B horror movie it was intended to be. I turned out to be more of a comedy, and they ran with it in this movie. Hilarious !! Bruce Campbell is awesome. The 3rd movie in this series is the best of all - Army of Darkness. A must see !!
B001KWTBVQ|5|Love it!
B002VWNID6|1|I hate the DVD - not the movie. Half way through the movie, it just stopped. Could not get beyond the black screen! Must be a pirated copy because the DVD had that very tiny print that you cannot read without a magnifying glass. So disappointed in this disc!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5|Great game until I get a phone call. I gotta restart my phone each time because it freezes. Please fix. Thanks!
B001RTP3YQ|5|I had never heard Leonard Cohen.  At 77 years of age how did I miss him?  Thanks to PBS I heard him for the first time.  He restores my pleasure in music.  He \\"speaks\\" to my life experience.  So wonderful at this stage in life.  Such a gift.
B005NFWCSK|5|Great movie
B001KDQ4KQ|4|a sad, but well written story of today.  I liked the character development and connections of the two families and how their familial connections changed them after tragedy strikes.
B000002NJS|5|For many years she has grabbed the attenion of millions of fans with her power of strength and freedom. Her work is always changing and &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; is a masterpeice of this age. I wait for her to once again  astonish the world with her work. She is a strong woman. -Jacklyn Watkins
B003NWS5AO|5|I first saw the band on a NPR fund raiser show and was struck by how joyful they all looked. Having come of age in the early 70s', Led Zeppelin was one of my favorite bands, so when I saw Robert Plant in a new group I had to buy it. Love putting it in the player on road trips.
B005XQLBU4|5|addictive<br />better than the original atari version better graphics. yet preserves the true ideal of the original would recommend for download
B00DPM90C4|5|Very, very good!
B001UTW7QU|4|The show is entertaining, but I wish they would tone down the gory just a little. Sometimes it feels like there are episodes where the only hook is how gruesome the 'crimes' can look.<br /><br />If the science were researched better, I would have given it 5 stars.
B000002MP2|5|Around 1994, the Epitaph/Lookout labels were really beginning to stockpile talent.  I heard Longview on the radio and bought the CD the next day.  I probably did not stop listening to it for weeks.  This CD, along with Smash, Let's Go, Punk In Drublic, and Smash really paved the way.  More importantly, it made me go back and purchase earlier CD's (1039 and Kerplunk from Green Day, Ignition from Offspring, Suffer and No Control from Bad Religion, White Trash and Ribbed from NOFX, Rancid S/T).  I hardly consider this a sell out album.  Green Day never had a true punk sound.  They were more a semi punk band, and that was/is fine with me.  I enjoy this CD just as much almost 20 years later.  It really cemented a great time in my life (I was elated all summer watching the Rangers win the Stanley Cup).  Just a lot of fun, great piece of history.  Unfortunately, we would only get one more quality CD out of Green Day (Insomniac) before they turned into MTV garbage.  Normally I tend to favor songs not released, but Basket Case is definitely my favorite.
B00DR0PDNE|5|I like it better that the Amazon fire TV.
B000QCQ8Y4|1|Tedious.  I have enjoyed Jack Reacher novels though this one is not up par.  The story goes nowhere
B004JMSIRC|5|Hello I'm telling you the order arrived and everything is in perfect condition. I'll keep buying more stuff. They are of very good quality. 100% recommended.
B003F3NDWG|5|See my review for the third season.  The best show on television.  I started watching Castle through Netflix.  I now own the first four seasons and am watching the fifth in real time.  I'll buy the fifth season when it comes out.
B00005OMTT|5|I;ll be quick to the point here...this is a great CD to have great S&amp;X to.  Get it, and use it.
B0081SRJSY|4|What can I say.  Tried it for free as one of Amazon's free app a day.  Glad I tried it.  The kids really like it. Can't beat free.
B0064X7FVE|3|Too many adds to go through to hear the weather. I understand the concept of ads to provide a free service but this goes over board and its hard to close them all out to get what I want to know about the weather.
B00A6CCF0K|5|Great read! You have done it again Si King!
B00GEEB730|5|A very satisfying study of people. Not for everyone, but those who like stories about real people will enjoy immensely.
B00AQ3K8IU|4|Another great read by Colleen Hoover, I've been a fan since Slammed and Point of Retreat. This is the only author that I've re-read her books since going electronic about 2 months ago.<br /><br />I can't wait for more work from her.
078401213X|5|Expertly directed(and written) by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a dream)and shot in very contrasting black and white, this is a brilliant look at genius and the toll it can take on the mind. The story centers around Max(Sean Gullete) who believes everything can be explained by numbers and is looking for the code that could unlock the stock market, and perhaps life. This may not be a pleasant journey for some because of the focus on Max's paranoia and obsession and the fact that it is conveyed so well, that it is like you are looking through his eyes for the 85 minutes you are watching the movie. A harrowing mindtrip of intelligence. My rating: 9/10.
B0031RS79U|5|I loved &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; as a child, but even then something about it repelled me. Now I see why. &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34; is a feast where behind each guest stands an angel with a sword. If a guest stops celebrating, the angel chops his head off.<br /><br />Best part of the book is Scrooge's sarcastic personality, which he manages to maintain even in the face of ghosts.<br /><br />About Kindle edition: on my Kindle PC, there are two lines under each chapter title. I can't say it looks beautiful. This annoyed me. But everything else is fine. Other editions are much worse.

B000QRIGLC|5|Best book to show what life was really like, and the true spirit of our brave men and what they are willing to do. It makes us proud that we have men willing to put their lives on the line for us, no matter what the political goals are.

B000008M54|5|This music just speaks to my soul. It is roots music, haunting, beautiful, familiar but refreshing. Mike Scott IS the Waterboys and he truly is a man with a vision. This time it REALLY came through.<br />I loved this so much back in 1988, that I went to see them at the Wiltern in L.A. all 3 nights in a row. I was alternately moved to tears and elated (I am not always so emotional!) I saw them again on a reunion tour at the House of Blues last year and was right in front of the stage. I stood directly in front of Steve Wickham, the man whose sound drove me to buy a fiddle which I still TRY to play! They were great, and I felt the magic again, it was amazing. <br />To me it is simply roots music, the place where the origins of Irish music, Scottish music, American country and blues music all come together and the lines that seperate them are erased. Check out the haunting steel guitar of &quot;When ye Go Away&quot;, of course the title track, and one of my favorite but less traditional songs, &quot;We will not be lovers&quot; for the frantic sounds of the fiddle. I love all the songs and so many are rare and exquisite gems! <br />Enjoy...

630463949X|5|It has been countless times that I've heard somebody say that it was The Dance show that made them become a Fleetwood Mac fan.  While my indoctrination to the group's music wasn't because of The Dance, it was my first viewing of Fleetwood Mac (the Rumours era) live, in concert.  I wasn't disappointed... well okay I was, I wish they did Little Lies.<BR>Still, The Dance is pure Rumours era Fleetwood Mac.  There are the classics from the Rumours album (the most represented album on this DVD,) a few from The White Album, the title track from Tusk and two releases from the Tango In The Night album along with a few new songs an old B-side song (Silver Springs) and an acoustic version of Lindsey's Go Insane.<BR>All in all, just to see Lindsey fingerpick on Big Love and Go Insane was worth it for me.  This is definitely one of the best live shows you'll ever see.
6305657947|5|I really loved this movie, and I'm not normally a fan of action movies.  For the wives reading this, if you want a \\"guy movie\\" for your hubby, this is the one to get him that you will enjoy watching with him.  There is fine part, romance, and some steamy loves scenes.

030745455X|4|Here is a sequel that doesn't suffer in the least from being one. Its an equally 'can't put it down' book like its predecessor, and the Blomkvist -Salander team gets only more addictive. Waiting to finish the trilogy.<br />I lament the fact that there can be no more to read after this.
B002LC2DQ4|5|This is the ONLY memory card possible with the Olympus Stylus Tough 8000, which I first saw several years ago on a TV ad in which it was abused with falling, icy water bath, dog biting, etc. That ad sold me on it. Little did I know at the time that it's proprietary memory card was only 2gigs big; not that I ever had a problem with it being filled up--the battery ran out of juice before that ever happened. The problem--and it was the only problem I could find--was that the Olympus Stylus Tough 8000 quickly became obsolete (I still have thousands of stills & vids: please see my Facebook page) because the memory card capacity is small compared to what you can get nowadays (64gigs+) on other action cameras, and I was just starting to learn all of the features, when two bandidos stole it off my Doublevision. Despite my desire to replace it, those thieves really took some of the best vid yet, elementary school students signing the former President Francisco I. Madero at a ceremony at Casa de Adobe, Cd. Juarez. Incidentally, that is a magnificent site, far superior to anything the USA has done, relinquishing Boundary Marker 1 to know more than a Border Patrol turn around point.
B0000025KI|5|Magnificent.<br />THE RIVER alternates between rockers like &quot;Cadillac Ranch,&quot; &quot;I'm A Rocker,&quot; and &quot;Out In The Street,&quot; songs that sing of carefree summer teen years that sound like they're blasting from the windows of somebody's Camero along the boardwalk, and a big set of tunes that address the real world problems that tug at your heals behind those idyllic scenes.<br />The real heart of THE RIVER are Springsteen's characters struggles with love and relationships.  They're all searching for somebody, finding somebody...but then what?  So many of them run into brick walls, finding out all too quickly that the happy ever after ends before it starts.  Haunting tunes like &quot;Stolen Car&quot; are hard to get past:<br />&quot;She asked if I remembered the letters I wrote when our love was young and bold.  She said last night she read those letters, and they made her feel one hundred years old.&quot;<br />But for all the hard times these characters come up against--losing love, driving girlfriends and their mothers to the unemployment office, struggling to keep a job--the final moment of THE RIVER is one of hope.  After consoling a dying man at the scene of a horrific car crash, Springsteen sings of climbing in bed and watching his girl as she sleeps:<br />&quot;I just lay there awake in the middle of the night, thinking about the wreck on the highway.&quot;<br />The road, which had been a vehicle of hope and escape on all of Springsteen's previous records, has been transformed into a black line between life and death; it is his love and home and security that suddenly seem comforting, instead of smothering.<br />But the next Springsteen LP, NEBRASKA, wouldn't stay at home...it follows those characters who chose to cross that black line and follow the road.

B0013J9KOO|4|Hellboy II:  The Golden Army is the sequel to the 2004 film [[ASIN:B00008EY65 Hellboy]] and based on the [[ASIN:1593070942 comic book creation]] of Mark Mignola.  Guillermo Del Toro ([[ASIN:B000WSLAUO Pan's Labyrinth]], [[ASIN:B000274TLW The Devil's Backbone]]) returns as the director despite the film being distributed by a completely different company.  Good for Del Toro, he really wanted to make this movie and up until I actually saw the film I'm not sure I understood why.  Del Toro really is becoming a real standout as a filmmaker of late and for me part of the reason is because he doesn't really care what he makes.  Unlike a lot of good directors, Del Toro isn't putting together a film to please his critics, but instead to please a wide audience.  He must also get some pleasure out it himself, because it really seems like this is just a guy who loves to make movies.<br /><br />Hellboy II provides a little more background for our demonic hero and then gets right into the film's plot and lots of action.  Basically, a long time ago this kingdom of elves and such raised the Golden Army to destroy humans but the battle was so one-sided that the elven (or is it elfvish?) king wanted the Golden Army stopped for a bit.  In the present time, the prince of the elves, Nuada (a fantastic villain played by Luke Gross) wants to raise the army again.  In order to do so he needs to put together the king's crown in order to control the army.  The crown is in several pieces.  Nuada is portrayed with more dimensions than your typical fantasy villain.  He kind of reminded me of Magneto from the [[ASIN:B000HEVZ9E X-Men movies]] in the sense that he was a villain with a really solid explanation that you could almost sympathize with.  His sister, Nuala (played by Anna Walton) is sort of caught in the middle.  Hellboy and his co-workers at the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) are called upon to investigate some things that leads to them crossing paths with Nuada's plan.<br /><br />Doug Jones is back as Abe Sapien and several other incredible creations that harness Del Toro's special effects team and give us a glimpse of what we are in for when Del Toro brings the Hobbit to the big screen.  Selma Blair returns as Liz Sherman, Hellboy's girlfriend with pyrokinetic powers.  Ron Perlman of course is back as Hellboy and we get a pleasant surprise in the comic relief character with depth named Johann Krauss, voiced by [[ASIN:B000083C6V Family Guy]] creator Seth MacFarlane.  The characters are many so they never wear out their welcome, but Del Toro is careful to maintain individual depth to almost all of them.  Hellboy is still the richest character in the story and Perlman tops his charm from the first film here.<br /><br />Del Toro really shows us a unique world with tremendous possibilities for many more exciting sequels.  He has an amazing imagination that he communicates well to one of the most talented filmmaking squads around.  It is almost a shame that Del Toro and company's voyage to Middle-earth will delay another sequel (perhaps with Dark Horse character Lobster Johnson?).  I wish there more guys like this around to keep making these fun and visually stunning movies.Doug Jones is back as Abe Sapien and several other incredible creations that harness Del Toro's special effects team and give us a glimpse of what we are in for when Del Toro brings the Hobbit to the big screen.

B000002AVF|4|&quot;Daydream&quot; is the first album that Mariah experimented with a totally different sound, HipHop, and it is my favorite to date besides &quot;Charmbracelet&quot;. Mariah has three number one singles from this album, &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, &quot;Always Be My Baby, and she later teamed up with ODB for the remix of &quot;Fantasy&quot;, which also went to number one. Other highlights on the album: &quot;Underneath the Stars&quot;, &quot;Long Ago&quot;, which she worked with Jermaine Dupri on, and &quot;Melt Away&quot;, which she worked with Babyface on. The song that really disappoints me: &quot;When I Saw You&quot;. I skip this song everytime. It lacks the formula Mariah usually uses. This album consists of R&amp;B, a little bit of HipHop, and smooth ballads. Definetly go get it.

This was Mr. Kyle s  story only.  I felt badly because  the people at home did not feel were not  involved personally.
B008578PRK|5|This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat!  I recommend it.
B000002MP2|5|I think you should agree with me when I say that 'Dookie' is THE best album Green Day have ever done. 'Nimrod' was good, sure, but it didn't have such awesome songs as 'When I Come Around' and 'Basket Case'.<BR>It kicks off with 'Burnout', and explosive with awesome guitar riffs and drum beats.<BR>'Having A Blast', the second song isn't as catchy as the rest, but it still delivers a loud punk melody.<BR>'Chump' is another song that is good, but doesn't really stick in your brain, playing endlessly over and over.<BR>'Longview' is something totally different. It's catchy, the lyrics are strong and well-written, and the instruments are used well, especially in the whole main beat during the verses which uses the floor and medium tom drums.<BR>'Welcome To Paradise' to me has always been known as 'The song after Longview', but when you really concentrate on it, it shows that this song is not to be passed up as 'Boring'. It displays contagiously catchy lyrics with strong guitar riffs.<BR>As I can't detail every song, I'm just gonna pick out the best ones in my opinion.<BR>'Basket Case' is usually the only Green Day song that everyday people have heard of. It's immensely catchy and the drumming on this track is... let's face it, AMAZING. The lyrics don't really make sense, but when you consider it's a song about a crazy person, you'll understand what Billie Joe's on about.<BR>'When I Come Around' is personally one of my favourite songs ever written. It might not be a ballard, but it shows all the properties to be a anthemic melody.<BR>'Emenius Sleepus' is a steady punk song with simple drum beats(I'm not saying they're easy--I play the drums and they're hard!!!) and good guitar chords.<BR>Overall, 'Dookie' is the best Green Day album ever and it deserves to be listened to by punk and rock lovers alike.<BR>I gave it 5 stars for these reasons alone.

B000002KHB|5|Machine Head (1972) is getting close to being 40 years old, but it still sets the mark for the early rock years.  This album is special in that it brought out Highway Star and Smoke on the Water, both if which went on to be super hits, especially Smoke on the Water which is included on many rock collection sets.

B006P4FBUE|5|First of all I just want to say I've been playing the piano in real life for about 15 years and I've been looking for a really good piano app for awhile now. I've downloaded several other piano apps but nothing can compare to this one. This is truly the BEST piano app in the store and here's why:<br /><br />-Full set of keys! There are two rows of keys (28 white keys, 20 black keys). This means you can play two octaves at once. There's also an octaves button you can choose making it a total of 4 different octaves available.<br />-It plays like a &#34;real&#34; keyboard in the sense that if you hold the note (or piano key) down the note will keep playing like a real piano. Tap it quick and short and it will do the same.<br />-Beats! There's a nice selection of beats so you can turn yourself into a one-person band. It's rather fun.<br />-Tons of songs! You can &#34;watch and learn&#34; to play a song, or play with a song and there's many songs to choose from. You can also play beats in the background along with the song you are playing.<br />-Don't know all the notes yet? Simply tap the &#34;Key Labels&#34; button and the name of the keys will show up on the corresponding keys.<br />-Great Digital Dolby sound! The sound quality is just fantastic.<br />-Change instruments, plenty to choose from.<br />-No bad permissions. It says &#34;4 minutes&#34; download but I was able to download it within a minute.<br />-No menu within in the app, which I like because it means I can start using the app faster, if you want to change anything, use different options, change settings etc., just tap onto the arrow sign on the bottom of the piano to open up the menu and options.<br /><br />What's not so great about this app?&#34;<br />-Well in the end it's not a &#34;real&#34; piano and since there are so many keys it can be difficult to play it as such at times BUT for the most part I truly think this is the next best thing compared to really playing. No other app I've downloaded for pianos or keyboards on my Kindle has come this close to playing a real piano.<br /><br />I recommend this app to anyone who plays the piano and would like to on their Kindle. I think this app would work really well on the bigger tablets, I'm using it on my 7 inch and if you have really big fingers/hands I could see that being a problem when trying to play the different notes but for the most part I've had no problem. If you are looking for a piano app THIS is the one you want!ianos or keyboards on my Kindle has come this close to playing a real piano.<br /><br />I recommend this app to anyone who plays the piano and would like to on their Kindle.

0679721037|4|This book describes what happened to six people who survived the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima as told to a reporter who visited with them and interviewed them in the months right after the war. This is a slim volume of 116 small pages. The stories were originally published in New Yorker magazine and later compiled into book form. As it turns out, the six people all had connections with each or knew of each other even before the bomb dropped, but this book does not discuss much of that. Instead, it starts out by detailing what each of the people was doing in the time before it dropped, then covers what happened to them over the next few days, and finally, discusses what happened to them over the intervening months as radiation sickness infected them.<br /><br />The descriptions are vivid and the people's recollections appear sincere and heartfelt. The stories are told by the participants and even though they are told in the third person, it is clear from reading this book that the stories were told to the author directly by the people involved. One thing that strikes the reader is the incredible amount of detail that each participant contributed to the story and the incredible memories that they had of just what they did as the bomb struck, and what they thought and felt in the immediate aftermath. The book does show its journalistic roots and timeframe as each participant is constantly referred to as Mr. so-and-so or Mrs. Such-and-such.<br /><br />Their stories, of how they dealt with their own injuries; how they started to look around them and comprehend the magnitude of the destruction; and how they found the humanity to help others are very well put together and well worth reading.<br /><br />This is one of those books that documented what happened to the people who were subject to one of only two such attacks in the history of mankind. Ultimately, their stories are not about the nuclear bomb that attacked them, but are stories of incredible survival and even heroism in very difficult circumstances. It is definitely a worthwhile read to understand the human spirit and its ability to handle adversity, but this is not the kind of book that I would recommend when you want a light or fun read. Due to the nature of this book and its subject, I must give it a four star rating.<br /><br />I understand that the author released an updated edition of this book in the 1980's after he revisited the six people he covers in this book and updated their stories. This review refers to the 1972 edition which I happened to find in a used book store.heroism in very difficult circumstances.

B000022TSH|5|I saw Chinatown a few times and never quite got what happened. Then a family member began attending a university in LA, and I visited the area in depth for the first time. I finally understood one of the basic plot lines about water acquisition, and I also began to understand the relationship betwen the Los Angles Basin and the San Fernando Valley. A native or resident of the area can appreciate this film even more. Some kind of geographic and historical background is probably essential to truly begin understanding it. The plot itself is already complex and demanding enough.<br />I rate this film among my top 30 favorite films, including it together with its sequel The Two Jakes as one unit.

B00008PX8P|5|I was a huge Zep fan as a teenager, so much so that I grew a little tired of them in my 20's and 30's. However, when I heard about this release, I felt like I was 15 again. Needless to say, I was not disappointed when I finally bought it. I felt like a kid in a candy store as I jumped from song to song. I've always loved Coda's version of &quot;I Can't Quit You Baby&quot; and was pleasantly surprised to see it performed live on disc one. That Albert Hall show really showed what a fantastic live band Zeppelin really was.<BR> Another cool element of the DVD was the visual evolution of the band throughout the 70's. Not only did they play cool music, they were the coolest LOOKING band of all time. That's why teenage boys loved Zep so much. Page and Plant's stage presence was phenomenal. <BR> By the time Knebworth came around in '79, they almost looked like professional businessmen. I know Page was pretty smacked out at this time and Jonesy was basically the musical leader, but it didn't matter. Just watching Page and Plant rip up Achille's Last Stand gave me goosebumps. Great Stuff!
B0002OERI0|5|Green Day took a risk with \\"American Idiot\\", and it turned out to pay off big time. The 'risk' is making an elaborate concept album in the year 2005. The term 'rock opera' was also thrown around, perhaps due to the fact that \\"American Idiot\\" is heavily influenced by The Who's late 60's material.    Luckily for the band, \\"Idiot\\" has at least 3 surefire hit singles, which helped it attain phenomenal mainstream success.    The title track is a powerful, insanely addicting, political punk anthem. We've heard this before, but it's never seemed to have more impact.     The big hit \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" is a dark, moody albeit downright catchy slab of pop/rock perfection. \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is another downbeat power ballad that has a shot at pop chart success (assuming the band releases it as a single).    The real winner is \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\", a 9 minute multi-faceted suite. \\"Homecoming\\" is the same idea, and another winner. The latter features some sections that remind me of \\"Grease\\"-style, sockhop rock (saxophone and all). They're both very ambitious, and reward you after repeated listens.    Other highlights include the anthematic \\"We Are the Waiting\\", the manic \\"St. Jimmy\\", the dreamy \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" (with its slight Indian sound), the Oi-infused punk of \\"Holiday\\", and the reflective closer, \\"Whatsername\\".    It's also great to see a thoughtful, creative album like this attain massive commerical success in addition to its critical kudos. It proves that the general public aren't always American Idiots.

B009YP9L7U|5|Enjoyed the book. It was a fun easy read. The characters were very likable. I would read more from this author.
B00MB6IYHW|5|Great movie!!!
B00992CF6W|5|I think the game is awesome because of all of the creapers and zombies and iindermen and indersheep and mostly slunderman!!!!!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5|This app is great for all ages. It is the best way to get your little girl her pony without the mess and the hassle.
B00SH04286|2|Soso. Not what I expected
B00729GQ0A|4|Odd supernatural tale. At first I wanted to rate it 3 stars, then I realized that the story, as crazy as it was, it did grow on me,  and I was sad to reach the conclusion of the book. So, in some strange way I was taken in by the writers very weird take on vampires, witches, and shape shifters with supernatural names and otherworldly powers.
B005PK553C|5|I loved this series!!  Great cast, with surprising twists and turns.  A definite must see!!
B006LSZECO|5|Enjoyed ! never knew what was coming next . Very good
B00QROH0QK|3|This movie was okay, I was expecting a little more with how everyone was raving about it.
B001KVZ6HK|5|great action, with humor and very enjoyable, highly recommend this to all action pack lovers.  can't wait until next movie
B00MWD7XR6|1|Heavily laced with political bias. I don't mind reading works with different views than mine, but this was so heavy handed that I almost couldn't finish it.  I enjoyed the first book of this trilogy the most. I'm glad I finished it, but this one was definitely the worst of the three and it's a shame to end with such a bad experience.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I loved it it was amazing and heart felt you cried and laughed it was an awesome book everybody should read it
B000O1799U|3|Nice smelling and goes on easy, can't really tell it's doing much more than say Gold Bond CoQ10 cream. But not a bad product either.
B000N6TX1I|5|I cannot give a poignant review that would do justice to *Children of Men*, like K. Harris and other top reviewers here.  Just read theirs, they've said everything beautiful about this film.<br /><br />All I can say is that this film enchanted me from the beginning to the end.  I love films that cause me to think after the movie is over.  But this one caused me to think about it days after I saw it.<br /><br />Clive Owens plays Theo Faron, living in England...in 2027.  People around the world has stopped being able to reproduce children.  The youngest human was 18 but was murdered for refusing to do something.<br /><br />Immediately after this murder, Theo's estranged wife appears and pleads him to help her sneak in Kee, an African-American refugee to the \\"other side\\".  However, she must have travel permits/papers.  After a round of adventure that resulted in a death, Theo discovers that Kee is actually pregnant.  The first such pregnancy in almost 20 years.  Theo suddenly understands why Kee must go to the other side...into the safety of the Human Project, whose aim is to cure infertility.<br /><br />All I can say is that *Children of Men* presented such an issue that is worth intellectual discussion.  For many, the possibility of a world-wide infertility is impossible.  However, if it should ever happen, how would the world react?  And if a woman was to get pregnant, would she be used as a political weapon or as a medical guinea pig?  And are you willing to die to ensure the birth of a miracle?<br /><br />I cannot decide which scenes were my favorites.  I liked the abduction of Theo.  I liked the escape from the Fishes.  I liked the war scenes between the army and the militia.  Heck, I liked everything.  This is truly one that you should have added to your DVD collection.
B003UXPVLM|5|This episode of LOTS was very suspenseful! When the mysterious confessor confessed the Seeker I actually felt sad. I didn't know if they where going to be able to break the magic that confessed him, but in the end it was great to see the seeker back to himself and the mysterious girl live a normal life.This show continues to captivate and amaze me!
B00DR0PDNE|3|ok
B000MNP2KI|4|This is the best, most believable, bond movie in my opinion.  It has a lot good action scenes.  Daniel Craig played this character very well.  For all the die hard bond fans, you might be dissapointed.  This movie doesn't have all the classic gadgets and villans.  That is why it is believable.  In all a descent flick.
1602379165|5|Love this so much I have both versions, one for the office and one for my home.
B0094LZY2A|5|On of the all time BEST movies!!!!!
B0057RCFQS|5|Wow didn't really need all of the extra footage and etc...but it's worth the buy! I really like the dvd case they really put some thought into it unlike allot of other trilogy set's I have that are just simple~ plane jane like. Past that I think the price is right for this set and I'm glade I finally own all three movies plus a little something extra to.
B000Q6GX5Y|5|Great movie, wish that blood could be seen on the ground though (only blood during fight and not after because the blood is computer generated), but other than that it is a great movie with a strong storyline.
B001GCUNYO|5|Seems as though the movie comes on FX every week now, but glad to have a Blu-Ray for whenever I'm craving it. Looks amazing on Blu-Ray. Taken 2 was a bit of a disappointment, really wish they had ended it with Taken.
B00DUGCLY4|5|The game itself gets slightly mundane but I'm here to rate the app. The app itself is well made, simple, and gets progressively more challenging.
B004XWLN20|5|I wish they had used Tom Welling in subsequent Superman movies. The casting is so great in Smallville it works for 10 years. Loads of action and soap.
B00633W614|5|This book was very readable from the first page.  Had trouble putting it down.  Only wish I had known that it was the second book in the series, the first being \\"Only Time will Tell\\".  Both an excellent read.  Can't wait for the next three.
B00E8KLWB4|3|I do like this game but my eyesight isn't very good.  I have a hard time seeing the items in the pictures.  It is possible to make the picture bigger but it doesn't seem to help as much.  Everything else is great.  Instructions make it easy to play.
B000A59PMO|5|This was a great show.  I am having a good time going back to the beginning and revisiting the story lines.  I am looking forward to catching up in set 3 as we had missed some programs and lost track of what was going on.  We were extremely disappointed when the show was cancelled.  Glad to have the DVD's.
B008JFURKG|5|Recommed for a guy, I'm getting this for my husbund for Christmas, I'm sure he'll like he is in to movie anyway plus he love Red 1.
1612680011|5|This book is a Phenomenal starting point for anyone looking to take action of their finances & future!
B002T9H2ME|5|Watch the trailer for it on YouTube to get you interested but keep in mind, it's not quite what you expect. The trailer does a good job of introducing the first part of the movie but the true plot is much larger than the trailer leads you to believe. The movie has a great soundtrack that really sets the mood. I dont want to give anything away but just watch the trailer and know that it only gets bigger from there. Give it a chance!
B00FAPF5U0|5|This is a all time favorite on all my devices. All I can say is I love candy crush. I like the fact that I can play with my Facebook friends and have a good time with competitive play.
B009CPES4I|5|Delightful!
0439023513|3|I ate the first two books up. I knew that nothing MAJOR would happen until at least the middle of the book like the previous two. Since in the first book, Katniss and Peeta didn't even ENTER the hunger games till about half way through, and the same with the second book.    But in the first two, at least the time and pages was for character development, plots and other things.    ____ SPOILER ALERT_______    In THIS last book. it was about Katniss hiding in corners, not talking and basically wondering around a blank slate.  And that goes on for a pretty long time.  It kind of reminds me of the section in the last Harry Potter book where they're wondering around in the woods for WAY too long, to the point where you want to skip ahead but are scared of missing that one sentence that has meaning.     not only that but the whole Peeta thing...  he comes back more than halfway through. All crazy and doesn't remember anything.  SLOWLY he starts to be calm...  THEN THE WAR!  people die so SUDDENLY. Especially Prim. Her death happened so suddenly and out of the blue that I had to re-read that part two or three times to even understand how she got there and WHAT happened.    then at the end they ship Katniss off to be a vegetable for half a year.  and Her and Peeta Magically get back together.  no detail about them even starting to talk to each other again or anything. last thing we remember them together like was him trying to KILL her right? It just seemed so RUSHED. a whole book of morning sleeping and depression with one paragraph for an ending.
B0060MYM3S|1|9.5 hours of boring dialogue by so many different people, with so many sub plots. It makes it hard to care what happens to any of them. And if killing babies is okay, then why are all of these evil people still alive after a complete season? Bought season one and two, will not buy season three.
B000002INR|5|Skid Row is a hard hitting Hair band that I love. Sebastian Bach is another singer from the 80's that has an amazing voice. The whole band rocks. One of those CD's you turn way up loud and just drive too..
B00DNV9V1W|5|This is a very handy screen protector for the phone. It perfectly protects my phone and I am very pleased that bought this protector. This is worth its money. It's OK.
B002FQOI0A|5|this was a great book. but for an 11 year old girl it can be a little confusing.it teaches you how to trust someone you dont feel confident with and be friends with them. I LOVED IT!
B001EO2UKO|5|Dido's songs from her past two albums have followed me for almost 10 years now. I think I know them all by heart, and I feel like they've become some sort of friends to whom I can turn to in every situation. When I travel, when I'm sad, when I'm in a good mood, when I drive. I don't have a particular kind of music I listen to all the time, but I \\"have\\" have a few artists who deeply touch me with both their music and their lyrics.   Needless to say, I had huge expectations for that third album. I must say, 'Safe Trip Home' fullfills every single one of them.   It is a great pleasure to listen again to her sweet, light voice, and her adorable British accent. But it actually goes beyond that. I have found the singer I always liked, but there is definitely something new in this album. More rythm maybe, more emotions. But it remains quite hard to identify. Exactly as it is hard to identify why her music is so enjoyable. Some of the songs in this album are just pure wonders. Like \\"Us 2 little little gods\\" or \\"The things we normally do'. Some are pure Dido material, like 'Look no further'. She put some beautiful arrangements, violons, piano.   I'm thankful for all these songs that are probably going to follow me for many many years again.
B00EV1YZ96|4|I was much younger when I first heard this film was being created. I was a diehard fairy tale fan. Hans Christian Anderson did not write this ending, but the Disney writers make up for that altering the story to be more kid friendly and still appeal to entertainment standards. Reading Anderson's version and watching Disney's gives us the best of both worlds.
0857522329|3|A disappointing book, but I suspect that I was influenced by the hype about the novel. I must admit I did keep reading and I anticipated a surprise ending. Surprise----no surprise.
B000FGGE68|1|I have never seen such a missuse of great sci fi effects.  The stunts are crazy, the graphics oustanding, but the story is so lame, the action to predictable.  She kills her enemies way to easy, there's no one to challenge her it does not make it interesting.  Now why Milla wasn't chosen for BloodRayne? perharps the movie would have done great, after all Rayne is modeled after her, I think this movie is trying to show us that Milla can be a Bad ass vampire warrior, but somehow it reminds me of Aeon Flux gone bad.  I am sorry but this movie is highly rental material is you want to have some good laugh, it can not be taken seriosly, don't get me wrong I love Milla as an action star but this was a major flop.
0143116177|4|My wife read this, but I have yet to read it.  She said she enjoyed it and it was informative.  She thought that the ending indicated that the author had &#34;an axe to grind&#34;.
B004MC8CA2|5|great bible easy to read need an APP
B00MELK918|5|Can not wait for next book.
B007IXWL2C|2|I read it because it was the last book of the trilogy but it was kind of a waste of time. I really only read these because there was so much chatter about them that I was curious. Fantasy romance really isn't my preferred reading.
B00L9B7IKE|4|Good read.  Kind of easy to figure out the plot but still tightly written.
0307266303|5|Without going into long, tedious detail, this book inspired me to run barefoot, run longer, and gave me a deep and meaningful connection with exercise that I had once lacked.
B00B2V66VS|1|I don't like this type of game.  Kids would probably like it and I am way past being a kid.
B00AH69ZN0|5|Love these songs
B007V2UGPE|5|it was working great but made other games stop working but other than that, it was the game of the year
B00DR0PDNE|5|Dig it !!
0345803485|3|It was okay.  I don't know what I was expecting.  It wasn't as exciting as people played it out to be.
B005NNUKF4|5|I love this album!!!!!
1400032717|4|Many are complaining that Asperger's isn't like how it's portrayed in the book. My cousin is autistic, and he acts just like the kid in the book, so it just shows you how different the condition can show itself.    Anyway, on to the book. I liked the different perspective the book provided. I really started to empathize with the protagonist. The story itself isn't very unique, but that's not the point. It's definitely worth reading, whether you're interested in autism or not.
B007V2UGPE|4|Solid graphics. It is an easy game to get into. waves are set at a good number. this is a fun game!
B00K7IPGS6|3|Movie was fine delivery ecceptional, case was crushed  during delivery had to replace
B00DHKKN6Q|2|Too easy!  I'm sure my grandkids might like it!  Also no directions at the beginning.  I just got by trial and error.
B00005JM09|5|I thought that this movie was excellent. The car chase sequence was spectacular and the brawl between the T-X and the Terminator was brutal but thrilling. This movie to my comparsion could beat The Matrix Reloaded released earlier this year. Also the ending to this movie was darker than the other two movies and lets you know that their will be a fourth terminator.
B00DUGCLY4|4|its ok not the best but good for passing time you need a lot of coins to anything of you get stuck. so its ok
B000002U82|5|If only life consisted of infinite time to lay around and listen to Dark Side of the Moon.  It has spoken to generations, and will continue to remain an accurate reflection of the human condition for as long as Mankind walks this Earth.  Pink Floyd rivals Tolstoy, Dostoevsky and Hemingway (all of whom I have read) as the most inspirational artist(s) in history.
B004I744AS|4|I  tried the dictionary . com app and it was slow and cumbersome, but this one is fast and fluid.  I highly recommend it.
B00F4PM6WG|5|My grand daughter is three and loved this! Would recommend for preschool age children. Also liked that you didn't have to keep buying things to enjoy this game.
B0001ARCFA|5|Sound is great but if you are looking at these you probably already know that. Cord is long, which I needed. Fits great, feels great, sounds great. Great headphones.
B005BGBPBG|5|Absolutely love this movie. I could watch it over and over. We went ahead and purchased it. Its a good Sunday movie. Thanks.
B009XIXVU6|5|After reading the kite runner I decided to give  this one a try and was not disappointed. Would definitely recommend.
B001RTP3YQ|5|This album reflects the passion and poetry of this great artist.  The DVD is even better as you can experience Cohen's depth visually.
0385344430|1|The story goes on. How does Diana keep us interested? Her mind is so wonderfully inventive its amazing. However....again she leaves us for three years wondering about the characters.  How will  William come to terms having two fathers who love him.  And how will Lord John feel about that?  Who are Fanny and Jane Pocock and who put Jane in a brothel at age ten for God's sake.  Is Ben alive? And Percy still chasing after Fergus offering a fortune, while he and his family live hand to mouth  with a dangerous occupation of printing, makes me  want to choke her. But if I met her I'd be too awed to complain.
B001TH8UUA|5|It a cable that does what it says. I'm not a fan of buying $40 HDMI cables that do the same thing as these. I would have gone for the braided one but I didn't need the extra durability.
B001DU8T6I|5|I love this CD, I can listen to it every day and still don't get enough  of it! I think that every teenage girl can relate to the lyrics of at least one of the songs. This is really one of the CDs I love the most (and ofcourse the Jonas Brothers).  Can't wait till Demi is coming to Holland, I know I'll be there :D    Greetings from Michelle,  Holland
0470601787|5|David Sibbet's Visual Meetings is a wonderful resource filled with great ideas and very practical suggestions. David cites examples of situations and links them to the skills he teaches and creates. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about human interaction, systems thinking, creative problem solving, and graphic recording. It is amazing!!
B00LFF3MKO|3|Worth a rent. a little farfetched. However, the storyline is like no other. it is a class b movie no matter what anyone else says. I own it and recommend renting not buying. At some points in the movie you will be reminded of willy wonka and the chocolate factory with the acting just fyi.
B000E0WJIC|5|Love this CD. \\"Scream\\" is the best of the bunch, but you can't go wrong with Bullet.
B00992CF6W|3|It is fun and all but after a while It started glitching. One time I went in my house and everything started disappearing. But still fun on multi player cause it dose not glitch.
B008TRUDAS|5|It was a good romantic and slightly sad read full of surprises and drama! It would be a good chick flick if they make it into a movie I would definitely buy the movie :)
B00DR0PDNE|5|This dongle is the best! I own two now and really enjoy it. I just had to update my HBOGo and they've added Chromecast now so I can stream, Netflix, Youtube, and now HBO from my iPhone and iPad to my TV. Amazon needs to step up and offer this capability as well.
B0088W4YTK|5|Love it!! Love them all.  SG1, SG Universe also!!
B000641Z90|5|First of all, this DVD is not for Genesis fans and Phil Collins specified it in the booklet. His career was pretty wide in musical creation and this DVD is a gift given for fans of Collins solo career. If you prefer Genesis songs and you would like to enjoy a real good Genesis concert, get \\"The way we walk\\" concert DVD or \\"Live in Wembley\\".  <br /> <br />This one offers a great retrospective of Phil Collins best songs from his beginning as a solo artist to his recent album. Everything is there ! His live performance is stunning considering he his half deaf. The band on the stage is incredible with a dozen of musicians. Visual effects are pretty good too.  <br /> <br />Daryl S., the guitarist, offers very good guitar solos and Chester T., the second drummer, has good respect for Collins interpretations on percussions. Sound recording as well as filming are both nearly perfect.  <br /> <br />My only complain is about the featurettes, boring I think. But Collins isn't a cheap guy, he personally supervised the production of the concert film on DVD. Generous, he provides us with all the videos from the songs on the concert setlist in addition to the Live Aid performance of \\"Agains all odds\\" and a few other extras.  <br /> <br />Overall, hours of great Phil Collins plus a photo gallery and wonderful live show !
B0089OBLDO|1|This it does not work with any third party Arcade Fight Sticks (anything not Sony). Buyer be warned. In terms of of support for arcade sticks for ps3 from the PS2/PS1 or Xbox 360, you will find it hard to find an adapter (I gave up). There was a product specifically made to help with this (some called the TAC adapter) but that adapter no longer works due to a firmware update on the PS3.
B0091WRCOA|5|Awesome.
0743270754|5|Being occasionally an idiot, I find myself with some form of prejudice against female authors. But Doris Kerns Goodwin does a masterful work in portraying the events and characters of Abraham Lincoln's day.      This is a fascinating character study of the people surrounding the American Civil War (an oxymoron if there ever was one). It is made possible by the fact that with no telephones, radio, or TV media; people wrote. They wrote to spouses, family, friends, enemies, rivals, newspapers, dairies, in both personal and public formats. Goodwin's apparent exhaustive study of these writings is obvious from the beginning as she exposes both the true and the two faced characters revealed by their own writings.      This book was fascinating for me in several areas. Lincoln had two qualities that usually do exist in the same person. He was a warm hearted, transparently honest, relational, forthcoming person of character and integrity. And he was a masterful genius of a politician.     I would make this 'required reading' for anyone who wants to hang on to their sanity in a political environment. By political environment I mean places such as the management & supervisor professions, classroom teaching, religious ministry, and certain family situations resembling my own.     But beware, Goodwin's exhaustive character development of Lincoln's contemporaries can get tedious. I occasionally skimmed thru some of it, much to my regret later in the book. Pay attention to all she says, there is an incredible payoff mid way thru.     I saw Barak Obama on the news holding a copy Team Of Rivals and saying something to the effect that it was his favorite book. If you are a fan of Obama, you ought to read it. If you are not, even more must you read it to understand what he might be up too.     Thomas S Boswell
B009WO7NQO|5|Kids like it because the interaction with the characters, you just don't lobe the birds you make them attack, which they enjoy.
B00MFU3EY2|5|great
0345529057|5|The first four books of George R. R. Martin's best novel for 20 bucks. The quality of the printing and paper is fair for what you pay, I thought is was going to be worse for the given price. The covers are nice too.    In my opinion it's a pretty good deal.
B000GG4Y32|4|For people interested in history, this was a sizeable and impressive production related to the epoch of the Russian Revolution.  Unlike most accounts, it was intended to reflect the revolution from the American viewpoint and not from Moscow.  As such, Warren Beatty plays the head of one of the communist party organizations, Diane Keaton the female companion, with Jack Nicholson and others having smaller roles playing personages from that time.  The plot follows the machinations of the American Communist party and it's interrelationship with the struggle in Russia.  The events in the US are rather mundane and very similar to the union activities of the time.  However, the film picks up a 'Dr. Zhivago' romance element when it heads to the point of action, i.e. Russia.  To be genuine and to know what's really afoot, Beatty heads to Russia to see the revolution in action.  One of the party operatives who confronts him, challenging his 'bona fides' as an authentic revolutionary communist, is a high-ranking Bolshevik, played by the author Jerzy Kosinski.  It's clearly the high point of the film, where a real 'Red' assails the dilettantes in the western world who talk a good game but don't achieve anything for the cause.    Presaging the decline of the Soviet system, even in its birth Beatty can see flaws and knows that the Soviet empire will never be a 'workers' paradise'.  We get the message that for all the weaknesses of our system, their system was hardly a panacea and the revolution there was more a power struggle than a fight for 'justice'...
B00C7KXUOE|4|Didn't like the gore, but overall very good writing and acting.  Very dark.  Could not figure out if this a true prequel?
B00CL66FEQ|3|It was pretty funny. had some good moments, worth a watch
0811879542|5|cute story -- simple is best
B00005LC1H|5|Anybody that likes comedy and television has to have Fawlty Towers-The Complete Series.  Like all fans of the show I only wish they made more episodes. But this collection is great.  I've turned my kids onto the show and we all have had many \\"laugh out loud\\" moments.
B002QE3CTY|5|Slow in the beginning.  Stick with it, you will love it! It is a quick read that you will want to follow up with the next book in the series!
B00Y6QF0PE|5|I was so excited to see Christians point of view!! Hope she writes two more so we can really see the change in his character!!
B000HCO83Q|1|Even the people on here who are giving this movie a less than stellar review are being too kind to this flick. Yes, we are all X-Men fans and we wanted to like this film but let's face it: This sucked. I hate sitting there after a movie and realizing that some dumb schmuck director just stole two hours of my time. Others have said what's wrong with the film but have gone easy on it. I won't. Don't waste your time. This director owes us a do-over.
B004MC8CA2|5|This is a great a great application!  With all the different reading plans it helps me stay in the word. Plans very from just a few days to a y rd at so there is something for everyone. The best part of all is that it is free!  You also download  different versions  that you can use offline.
B008IJTFYW|3|Heck i fell asleep waiting for it to download..but yeah other then not playing when you leave the app its pretty cool.
B000050HTO|5|I'm a baby boomers it's my kind of music.  Good selection.  Having prime and getting quick delivery is so good. Will buy more when I feel the need.
B0063IH60K|3|The kindle fire is much slower at solitaire versus and I pad.  The screen layout changes from verticle to horizontal and is distracting as well as slow.  I am glad it was free because I would have hated to pay for this game
B00127RAJY|5|1.) I'm too lazy to go to the gym 3-5 times a week.  2.) I could never stick to an intense workout like P90X.  3.) I'm BUSY.    I bought this DVD because I just wanted to get back into shape and have a regular, healthy work out routine I could stick to. I rarely went to the gym because I never knew what to do besides run on the treadmill, and I felt like my workouts were not making a difference in my body. The 30 Day Shred is the best workout I have ever done. I rarely sweat, even when I go running for 30 minutes, but I have sweat dripping off my face every time I do this workout. And I've been doing it for two months! I love that I feel all my muscles burning because I know it's working!    My goal was to lose 5 pounds that I gained during the school year, and I was able to achieve my goal WITHOUT DIETING. I just tried to eat healthy. I'm very happy with the results. I'm sure that I would have lost more weight if I had been on the meal plan, but I was looking to get into shape, not lose a lot of weight.
0671449028|5|It's a wonderful book for toddlers who love animals. Strangely, my daughter (22 months at the time of this review) doesn't really like animals, and so after a short spike she lost interest in this book and doesn't want to read it anymore. It is sad, because it was one of the first books that she virtually memorized and could supply the next word of the story. I want to believe that it's temporary, because it's a delightful story with great rhymes and funny illustrations. We are going to pare down her library a bit soon, but I am not selling or donating any of Sandra Boynton's books.
1564029654|3|It's a good little book - mom is gone, the kids worry, mom comes back and everybody is happy.    But I really can't get the kids to show very much interest in it, and I don't often choose it to read either.
B0029VUV70|5|Excellent
B009NG1Q96|4|Loved this book!!!
B00BAXFECK|5|This is a powerful, funny, book. I loved the character of Boris.We should all have such a friend. I totally recommend this book.
B007ZGO7EM|5|Best calculator app I've ever tried. I won't be trying anymore, now that I got this one!<br /><br />It looks and works great!
B00005R8FI|5|Sm00th

B000FC2L1Y|4|Drums of Autumn is an epic historical romance, historically fascinating – Ms. Galbaldon obviously does meticulous historic research – and is rich with imagery. Her writing skills are fantastic, her plots excellent, and the characters come to life on the page. So, why am I giving it only four stars? Because I found the pace of the book a little too slow, and because too much of the book focuses on Brianna, Claire’s daughter, and Brianna’s boyfriend, Roger. It takes away from the story of Claire and Jamie, one of the most memorable relationships in fiction. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this and the preceding three books in this series.
B00KB3PZ60|4|Great movie, but I could not find the Once Upon a Parade bonus feature on the DVD.
1573223026|2|I loved High Fidelity and \\"About a boy\\" but did not enjoy \\"How to be good\\" or this latest effort \\"A long way down\\" as it seems to stray away from his strengths as an author which are basically describing how weak and useless males are in a some hilarious context. The characters are weak and it's really hard to believe at any level that they want to commit sucide. Jess is incredibly annoying and although that was the intention her character is simply too much. There are a few funny moments but they are few and far between. It's sometimes hard to figure out if this is a comedy or a trajedy and doesn't really work at either level. Not his best work in any case
B00L9B7IKE|5|Great book!  Had a hard time putting this book down!

B000TXZVGQ|5|I am so glad that they made this DVD box set available. Even though I'm older now, I still can remember feeling the way Angela felt in high school. This series is one of the greatest ones about teen angst. Go My So-Called Life!    Other series they ought to bring to a DVD box set:    Daria  Swan's Crossing
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Oh, the vagaries of life!  I really loved this book and the way the author interlinked their lives.  How sad, but totally compelling - it was difficult to put down and the characters stayed in my mind long after I closed the final page. I won't try to summarize, since the interaction is so complicated.  All I can say is it's well worth the time to savor this look into the secrets stored behind closed doors.  I'm looking forward to her next book and plan on catching up on her previous novels.
B002SAUCBC|3|I love Stephen King, sometimes.  The man is a prolific writer and sometimes that's his downfall. When you've written a gazillion books, not all of them can be winners and \\"The Long Walk\\" isn't a winner, in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong, it's all right, but, that's the problem...it's just all right and not up to the standards I expect of Mr. King. I also read [[ASIN:1439149038 Under the Dome: A Novel]]and was greatly dissapointed. As in \\"The Long Walk\\" it has its moments, but if you're expecting a [[ASIN:0385086954 Carrie]]or a [[ASIN:0743437497 The Shining]]you're going to be dissapointed.  Sometimes Mr King writes just to write and for that I'm sorry.

B00HXYKYIE|5|I have always been a fan of Jodi's writing style and the way she explains the characters. This book is by far my favorite. I enjoyed reading this and not knowing what was going to happen until the very end. I usually have some idea of how it will go, but in this book I had no clue. Every time i thought i had it, something else would happen and change everything. this is one of those books that leaves you wondering and I became fascinated by elephants. i highly recommend everyone read this, and i promise you will love it just as much as i did!

B000MXPE7O|3|Robert De Niro takes the director's chair in this 2006 CIA epic. Matt Damon stars as Edward Wilson, whose career as an agency spook begins with his enlistment into the OSS during WW 2 and continues through that organization's metamorphosis into the CIA.    The film opens in 1961, at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion. When we are first introduced to Wilson, it is quickly established that he is an officious and inscrutable, yet loyally dedicated Company man. As the story begins to jump back and forth in time (a la \\"Godfather II\\") we begin to get glimpses of what lies beneath Wilson's seemingly impenetrable veneer.    We witness a (relatively) looser and more outgoing Wilson during his college days at Yale in 1939, as he is inducted into the infamous Skull and Bones society. As part of the initiation ritual, he is directed to regale his fellow Bonesmen with the deepest, darkest secret from his past. The club members get more than they bargain for as Wilson relates a harrowing childhood memory of bearing witness to his father's suicide. Moments before taking his own life, his father hands down a credo about \\"trust\\", which becomes the key to unlocking Wilson's inner workings for the remainder of the film.    Therein lies the problem with \\"The Good Shepherd\\". There is an awful lot of internalizing going on (for 2 hours and 47 minutes). De Niro's plus as a director (not surprisingly) is his willingness to give his actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters. His minus as a director is his willingness to give his actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters, if you catch my drift. There are some pacing issues with the film. Not that I was expecting car chases and stuff blowing up real good. After all, the reality of espionage does not necessarily lend itself to flash cuts and pop music montage. It's generally a somewhat somber, mundane and unpleasant business.    Eric Roth's script has its moments, but gets murky when it comes to the intrigue. It is tough to keep track of who is doing what to whom, and why (and at times, for whose \\"side\\"?). Granted, perhaps that is part of the point; torture is torture and murder is murder, no matter how one attempts to rationalize (a point that Steven Spielberg more than sufficiently bludgeoned us over the head with in \\"Munich\\") but I GET it,already.    Perhaps the most fatal flaw in the film is Matt Damon's unconvincing \\"aging\\". There is not much discernable physical transformation between Wilson's collegiate years and middle age. (Maybe some better prosthetic work could have helped?). At any rate, I just wasn't buying it, and found it to be a major distraction. Damon is a fine actor, but I think he may have been slightly miscast here. History buffs may still find the film worth a look.

B000AP04EW|4|I didn't expect to like this movie. By the time I finally got around to catching it on cable TV I was Brangelina'ed out. Feh. But \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" is so much fun to watch, never mind that it is completely and totally unbelievable, that you can't help hanging in for the ride and enjoying almost every minute of it.<br /><br />So: He's John. She's Jane. They're both gorgeous. (Being Pitt and Jolie, what else would you expect?) They meet in Bogota, Colombia in the middle of some government mess, and it's love at first sight. Flash forward to five or six years later (they're not sure which), when they are contentedly if boringly settled in suburbia, each going about their daily business. She thinks he's the head of an engineering firm. He thinks she's the head of a computer company. What neither of them knows is that each is a top agent for rival companies of international assassins, and each company has contracted them to take out the same target, a young hunk named Benjamin Danz a/k/a \\"The Tank\\", nicely played by Adam Brody. Through a series of mis-steps, each gets in the other's way and the target escapes. Their respective companies are not pleased. Now they're each assigned to do away with the hindrance, and they find themselves with 48 hours to kill each other.<br /><br />From there, the craziness multiplies exponentially. \\"Do you know you're ticking?\\" asks an incredulous bystander, warning John just in time that an explosive device is about to detonate in his jacket pocket. \\"That's TWO TIMES you've tried to kill me!\\" shouts John into his cell phone while racing Jane home in a purloined limousine. \\"Oh come on, it was just a little bomb,\\" she sniffs as she zooms down the highway towards home, where an enraged John is headed and all hell is about to break loose. And amid gun battles, exploding houses, car chases and general mayhem, they discover that their respective firms are not pleased to learn that they are married (sleeping with the enemy is a no-no), and set up the Tank mission all along as a trap for them to take each other out.<br /><br />The plot is so off the wall that it would defy the belief of a five-year-old, but this movie doesn't ask to be taken seriously, as if anybody would. It's a fun movie and doesn't pretend to be anything else. We see the Smiths going about their daily (or nightly) assignments as he is sent to assassinate a guy named Lucky at his poker game; when he returns home, Jane asks John how the game went; John replies, \\"I got Lucky.\\" Har-de-har-har. While John has been off bumping off Lucky, Jane herself has gone to the hotel suite of a notorious gun-runner with a taste for S & M. \\"Have you been selling big guns to bad people?\\" she coos as she strokes his hair and takes hold of his neck. Twist. Snap. Thud. Out the door just in time to make it to the Colemans' cocktail party. Typical life in suburbia.<br /><br />But what really makes this movie is the chemistry between Pitt and Jolie. From their first scene together, these two set off sparks. Their magnetic attraction to each other, even while they're doing their level best to kill each other (or at least to keep from getting killed by the other) hold them and the movie together. Pitt has some nice comic turns (\\"Honey, you're overreacting!\\" he shouts at her while she tries to run him down with her car. \\"We don't want to go to bed angry!\\") and a couple of tired comic turns as a klutz who keeps making noises dropping things when silence is essential), but it's Jolie who holds our attention more. She sizzles and smolders and her eyes speak volumes; this lady hardly needs words to communicate with eyes like hers. But the movie is almost stolen by Vince Vaughn as John's colleague Eddie, a loser who still lives with his mother because she's the only woman in the world he can trust, even while he yells at her for keeping tabs on him. An assassin and a momma's boy? Hilarious -- and as unlikely as the rest of the film. The movie hits total disbelief through the final gun battle with their firms' combined hit team, in which John and Jane take out every agent with a minimum of fuss and bother, while the hit team acts like The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight. Well, hey, it's only a movie.<br /><br />When all is said and done, \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" treats us to two hot actors in very nice performances, lots of comedy, loads of action, and not a whole lot else. It doesn't demand anything out of you except to suspend belief and enjoy the ride. Pass the popcorn.<br /><br />Judy Lindtheir firms' combined hit team, in which John and Jane take out every agent with a minimum of fuss and bother, while the hit team acts like The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight.

B006903GX8|5|I found this book a great way to learn the history of the period but also the process involved in the creating of the series. It is a very well written comparison of the period and then how that translated into the series.

B009IEXKXI|5|This was just what I needed during a short flight, the book is well written with out the typos seen in a lot of e-books. Fast read with a serious story offset by good humor.
B005LAIIMG|4|This is a pretty good zombie movie. Those who like The Walking Dead should like this one as well. Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane who formerly worked for the United Nations as an investigator. Now he is fighting a war on zombies. This movie has some good special effects and a pretty decent plot. The makeup artists and costume designers did a nice job with the zombies.<br /><br />One part I disliked was when Brad Pitt is armed with a tire iron on his way to enter a wing of the WHO lab where the infectious diseases are kept. He puts the tire iron down and enters the lab leaving the tire iron outside. Really? There are possibly zombies outside and you convenientally forget your only form of protection? Not very believable. No way am I forgetting to bring that tire iron inside with me. Other than that, I really liked this movie. There is not that much new here that we haven't seen elsewhere but hey, who needs lot of new stuff when we have zombies.
B00DAPOHU6|3|A little bit disappointed in Jack Johnson's newest CD. I love all of his other CD's, but this one is mediocre compared to his previous works.

B0018OAPAW|5|I had been waiting for this cd for almost 5 years.  That is an eternity when your second favorite (after Bad Religion) band takes that long to release their next album.  I love all of The Offspring's cds, and I had incredibly high expectations for this, and they were met.  The ONLY problem I have with this cd (and their last) is they are just too short.  Granted, this one is 10 minutes longer than \\"Splinter,\\" and it's not unusual for punk cd's to clock in at 30 minutes or even less, but I was just hoping that after 5 years they could put together 45 or 50 minutes.   But hey, if that's your only complaint, maybe that just means it's so good that it seems to fly by and you simply don't want it to end.  The first half of the album is pretty fast-paced and then slows down.  But the slow songs are also incredible, with the exception of \\"Fix You,\\" which I unfortunately would have to say is the Offspring's worst song ever.  I usually skip that track, and I can't say that about any other Offspring song on any other record (actually maybe \\"Denial, Revisited\\" from Conspiracy of One too).    But other than that, you have your standard fast Offspring melodic rock and roll, with Dexter's voice sounding better than ever at 42.  If you liked Offspring's previous records you should definitely like this one.  I can't wait for the next one to come out in 2019.
B004J4WKTW|3|The Night Circus is, simply put, a collection of images, visuals & sensory pleasures brought to life by words in the most fantastical of worlds.  Told in a confusing jumble of back and forth time hops, Morgenstern tells the story of a most tragic competition. Marco & Celia are raised sternly, without love and for one reason alone - to win a competition.  To that end Marco and Celia train relentlessly for years practicing magic, illusions, spells, and all sorts of esoteric & mystical arts. Little is know about the competition. When will it take place? Who will be the competitors? How does one win?<br /><br />One thing is certain  - the venue. A magical circus that arrives like the night and leaves with the dawn. The circus travels around the world without advertising or fanfare. Meticulously decorated in white, black & silver, the color scheme permeates every aspect of the tents and their acts. And what acts! Ice gardens, wishing trees aflame in candles, cloud rooms, gravity defying acrobats and mystifying illusionists.<br /><br />It isn't long after Marco and Celia join the circus that the participants and venue are identified.  Celia and Marco have been set up to compete against each other in the most bizarre of competitions with the most tragic of outcomes. They must compete against each other, creating grander spectacles and illusions while keeping the circus running because the circus has become an extension of their own spirits and must feed off of them to survive. The winner is the one who can handle the strain the longest and there can only be one. Given these circumstances will Celia and Marco ever  have a chance to live outside the competition and embrace their love?<br /><br />Morgenstern's novel is slow and plodding. The words carefully chosen but not displaying any particular flair. Rather, it is the imagery that rules the book. Wondrous  imaginative creations described in meticulous details. Morgenstern's imagination is like that of a painter and the novel is never more alive than when an outfit or magical piece is described.<br /><br />Action is slow in this novel and the romance a retrained passion expressed by shared glances and brought to life in the amazing acts each develops in an effort to give life to emotions that can't be uttered.  But The Night Circus is without a doubt a tragic love story wrapped in greed, vanity and mania. Many may disagree but this is certainly not an HEA in the traditional sense. Instead it is a cerebral tale of man's quest for control and dominance of this world around him. An obsession - if you will - with being right at whatever cost.<br /><br />The book left me with some incredible images but over all made me feel terribly sad and despondent.vel is never more alive than when an outfit or magical piece is described.<br /><br />Action is slow in this novel and the romance a retrained passion expressed by shared glances and brought to life in the amazing acts each develops in an effort to give life to emotions that can't be uttered.

B00C1BU7V8|3|I enjoyed watching this and felt compelled to learn more about some of the aspects of the passing of the 13th amendment that I found surprising. I was disappointed when my Web search revealed the flagrant and unnecessary misrepresentations of facts regarding the vote for the amendment. Connecticut congressmen did not oppose the amendment to abolish slavery as the film depicts. All four congressmen from Connecticut voted for the amendment. With such important names attached to the project it seemed unbelievable that the storytelling would be so inaccurate and sloppy. There can be no excuse to needlessly change history.

B00GRHVIGU|5|At this late date, my feeling about the surviving ex-members of the Byrds is that if they're out there performing -- whether it's on Channel 13 (McGuinn) or at the Boulton Center on Long Island (Hillman) -- and recording occasionally, that's all we can expect, and not to set the bar too high in the recording category, either; they've done their service to us, put in their time and shown us their best. And then along comes a recording like this, which I spotted at Barnes & Noble while waiting on line to buy an issue of UNCUT magazine, and, having meant to pick it up upon release, bought it, just expecting to reasonably enjoy it. Was I wrong! -- Crosby may have relinquished his guitar on all but one track here (\\"If She Called\\") and gets lots of help in the composing department, but it turns out he can still deliver a compellingly serious, sometimes playful, and always complex album, and one not all that different from IF I COULD ONLY REMEMBER MY NAME (which I regard as a masterpiece), and with lots of great playing by those around him (most notably Marcus Eaton, who also helps with the vocals, and Crosby's son James Raymond). CROZ turned out to be a lot better than I expected, and a lot better than I felt I could expect at this late date from any ex-member of the Byrds (or, for that matter, CSN) -- at its best, which is most of its length (ESPECIALLY on \\"Slice of Time\\"), it's easy to draw a line from the genius behind songs like \\"Renaissance Fair,\\" \\"Mind Gardens\\" and \\"Lady Friend\\" to this album -- the ethereal beauty of the melodies and, in particular, the choruses, the punchy rhythms behind those choruses, and the power of the words, it's all of a piece with the man's best work from 40 and 50 (!) years ago.<br />I've got no complaints, and I'm recommending it to everyone I know. What's more, listening to it for the fourth time in three days, it dawned on me that if someone had asked me back in 1971 what kind of record I might HOPE for from David Crosby 30+ years on,my answer in those young and hopeful (and relatively innocent days) wouldn't have been too different from CROZ.

B000XUBFE2|4|To me, the book was troubling, but with Death being the narrator and Nazi Germany during WWII as the setting other  readers will no doubt feel the same. The running theme of extraordinary kindness being juxtaposed with unthinkable evil was meaningful on several levels. My favorite character, Rudy, made me laugh as I read the book, and his escapades continue to flash through my brain at unexpected times.<br /><br />The target audience is probably high school and above because of the language and topics, but I was wishing younger students could vicariously experience the historical aspects and the perspective of the more average German of the time.

B002VPE1WK|5|Just got this bag today and I'm disappointed in the size.  If the bag was just a little deeper, it could fit gripped camera bodies so much easier.  I have a Canon 5d mk ii, gripped, and it barely fits in the bag.  I feel like I'm going to bust the zipper when I try to close the bag b/c it is a tiny bit too small.  If I took the grips off both of my camera bodies, this bag would fit both wonderfully.  I would only recommend this to people using non-gripped cameras.<br /><br />**Update**<br />The camera bag seems to have stretched out a little and I'm able to fit gripped cameras a lot easier.  I also switched to Nikon and they fit even better than my Canons did.  I didn't think there was a noticeable size difference in the 2 brands, but apparently there is!<br /><br />Overall, I love this bag! Best $35 I've spent!

He has a deserved reputation as a travel ninja, and has books about that on his site.    This book is about more than that.  What's almost as well-known as his travels is that his traveling is part of a conscious, well-thought out, altruistic life plan, based on personal responsibility, creating meaning and leaving a legacy that motivates and assists others.  This book is a compactly written, compassionate and direct manual for you to do the same, on your own terms, from your own values.

For all the reasons he mentions, this isn't for everyone. The faint of heart need not apply.     For the rest of us, a huge community worldwide, this book is a battle cry.   This book is a direct challenge to being pecked to death by the ducks of conformity.     This is aikido writing. No aggressive confrontation: instead from a stance of self-awareness, a powerful, perceptive force of ideas.   Wham, and we're relocated into possibility. We are shifted back into our own lives.

B00S24RSBK|5|Words fall short to describe this masterpiece of work. Grieving and struggles are put through simple musical arrangements blended with Sufjan's haunting vocals that make this album one of his simplest but most profound albums.

B004GHNIRK|1|I DID NOT MAKE THIS PURCHASE AND I AM CONCERNED AS TO WHY IT WOULD BE IN MY REVIEW LIST.
B004Q1FDHO|1|This &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; version is just the free version with an inflated price tag. It contains the same adware as the free version and the same IAP. The IAP should have been removed after paying the 5 dollar upgrade, but the only thing changed for this version is the ad banner on top is removed. But the adware and the IAP are still active regardless of shelling out the extra cash. Avoid this money hungry developer and save your money.

B00M8HWG5U|5|Perfect! Love the record so much!
B0017R5UA0|5|Vinyl format (1 LP, 1 EP, gatefold jacket, poly inner record sleeves). Included with this self-titled album is the Sun Giant EP.  LP Track Listing: Side A 1. Sun It Rises 2. White Winter Hymnal 3. Ragged Wood 4. Tiger Mountain Peasant Song 5. Quiet Houses 6. He Doesn't Know Why  Side B 1. Heard Them Stirring 2. Your Protector 3. Meadowlarks 4. Blue Ridge Mountains 5. Oliver James  EP Track Listing: Side A 1. Sun Giant 2. Drops In the River 3. English House  Side B 1. Mykonos 2. Innocent Son  I first got Fleet Foxes in digital format when it came out in 2008. I play it regularly every winter. It is such a fitting soundtrack to snow and cold in Michigan. This is one of the first albums that made me regret no longer having a turntable. My first listen of this album reminded me of the warmth of listening to vinyl. When I finally got a new turntable this year, I knew I was going to pick up this album on vinyl.  I always thought the album cover art for Fleet Foxes was interesting, but one does not really get to enjoy cover art that much in digital format. I really like it now that I have the full sized album cover. The records are in quality poly inner record sleeves, which is always a plus to me.
B004J1DBJI|5|The best thing ever made, hands down.

Thank you so much Amazon for the amazing way you treat us, and for solving any problem we might have!!!!
B006LSZECO|5|Since the first chapter I was hooked. I was very intrigued and in awe. It's one of those books you can't put down. I was very impressed with the great detail and perfect picture it paints. I'd like to read another book by this author.
B007TBZ63Y|5|Awesome! I loved it! I can't wait for the next book to come out! But... when does it come out?
6305358567|2|Yes, there is tremendous darkness and violence in this movie---I don't remember ever seeing such a vivid burning at the stake in those opening moments: Cate Blanchett is wonderful---perfect to play the young Queen!Some  strange assumptions are made about the history of the period and the  Queen's character: for a better picture see Elizabeth R with Glenda  Jackson. Some of the conclusions are just too weird.A note about the  costumes: if you're going to do a story about Elizabeth and set it in a  different historical period for some effect, GREAT! but don't try to pass  off early 20th century clothes as Elizabethan. Makes my teeth grate!

B00LM9IBOU|4|Itâ€™s been five years since Ace Frehleyâ€™s previous studio album Anomaly was released. Prior to that, it had been twenty years since Ace had released any solo material, as Trouble Walkinâ€™ had been released in 1989. Itâ€™s fair to say that Frehley is taking his solo career a little more seriously these days as far as creating new material for his fans, especially since he, and his fans, arenâ€™t getting any younger.  Now, Frehley releases Space Invader, an album of twelve new tracks (standard version) which promise to ride tandem with the likes of his 1978 Solo Album recorded while still in his former band KISS.  The problem is, hype seems to have come at a higher value than substance. Months before the release, the album cover was revealed, and the announcement of famed artist Ken Kelly designing the album artwork, excited many die hard KISS fans. Kelly, as many know, designed KISSâ€˜ most well-known album covers, Destroyer and Love Gun. That sort of nod to the past is nice, but what weâ€™re really interested in is how an album sounds, not looks.  As far as how the album sounds? Hereâ€™s the negative aspects:  The opening track, Space Invader isnâ€™t the strongest track to open an album. Itâ€™s not a bad song, but itâ€™s certainly not a powerful opener. The chorus suspiciously sounds similar to the chorus in KISSâ€™ Young and Wasted from 1983s Lick it Upâ€¦an album Frehley had no involvement in making. Nonetheless, it sounds very similar. And this is just me, but I have a pet peeve about leading your album off with the title track. It basically says, hereâ€™s the most important song and the rest are there for your enjoyment.  I Wanna Hold You, Toys and What Every Girl Wants sounds an awful lot like Frehleyâ€™s Comet outtakes from the 80s, and reworked for this album. They sound irrelevant and donâ€™t fit properly within the confines of this album.  The biggest negative is the inclusionof The Joker, a cover of The Steve Miller Bandâ€˜s classic tune. Frehley, whose no stranger to recording cover songs (sometimes multiple times on one album such as Trouble Walkinâ€™) has without a doubt recorded a dog for this album. To be fair, his version is no better or worse than the original. But why on earth would one of the most influential guitar players of our time record a version of one of the most overplayed (and somewhat annoying) songs? Do you know what the beauty of Frehleyâ€™s version of New York Groove from his 1978 Solo Album was? The fact that it was an obscure song from an obscure band. Iâ€™m guessing some of you reading this had no idea that New York Groove was a cover song (originally recorded by a band called HELLO.) Regardless, thatâ€™s what makes cover songs great. The fact that many people donâ€™t know of it in the first place and youâ€™re talented enough to put your own spin on the song. Frehleyâ€™s version of The Joker sounds like someoneâ€™s drunk uncle got up on stage and sang a bad karaoke version of it.  The Positives, and there are positives to this:  The lead single Gimme a Feelinâ€™ is a classic Ace rocker with plenty of loose swagger. Immortal Pleasures and Inside The Vortex shy slightly away from the usual Ace offerings and thatâ€™s what makes them great. Iâ€™ve never seen much point in serving up the same songs over and over again until they are liquified completely. Past the Milky Way is another great example (musically, but not so much lyrically) and an enjoyable listen. Straying away from his usual â€œFracturedâ€ instrumental, Frehley ends the album with the stand-alone instrumental Starship. Itâ€™s a higher tempo than his usual instrumental offerings, which is probably why it doesnâ€™t bare the title Fractured Five.  My Thoughts:  Aceâ€™s vocals are good. Heâ€™s no Robert Plant or Freddy Mercury, nor has he ever claimed to be. Ace is a unique vocalist with his own style and delivery. On a few occasions, I found the vocals to be muddy on this album. Not as clear on previous efforts. His guitar playing is stellar. Great solos, hooks and change ups. Lyrically, it suffers slightly as there are way too many outer space references. We get itâ€”you are the original Space Ace. None of us have forgotten. Also, I feel the subject matter of Aceâ€™s darker days of drugs, alcohol and car accidents have now been beaten to death. I was hoping for an Ace Frehley rebootâ€”offering us something new in light of his more recent experiences, triumphs and outlook on life. Finally, the overall production could be improved upon. Iâ€™m wondering why Eddie Kramer was never called upon. Kramer has a history with Ace and his production work on the 1978 solo album, as well as 1989s Trouble Walkinâ€™ are home runs. I sincerely feel that he could have made this album that much better had he produced it.  And Finally:  All in all, I have to say this album is worthy of 3 stars. Rather low and disappointing for an album that took five years to make. Well, more than likely not 5 years. This doesnâ€™t sound like the album die-hard Ace fans have been waiting anxiously for. Perhaps in the not-so-distant future, Frehley should dig into the archives and remix or even re-record some of his early Frehleyâ€™s Comet demos such as Catch Me When I Fall, The Hurts On and The Girl Canâ€™t Dance. Fans have been craving professional recordings of these tracks for decades. Perhaps even an all covers album, seeing as Frehley is hell-bent on recording other peoples songs. Just donâ€™t try to make a hodgepodge out of a new studio album because sometimes it just doesnâ€™t work.
B0089EHWQE|5|This is a wonderful book. The beginning took me a bit to get in order in my head, but from there on it was great. It really makes you stop and think of your life and the people in it. It is worth the money and time to read! You will recommend and pass it on, believe me!

B00AKKS278|5|If you want a book that will change your life....this book is a must read.<br /><br />I read about 30-40 books per year and this is one of the best.  Why?  Hal puts it in a format that makes you feel like he has been where you are (and he has).  I've read similar books, bit this one puts it all together.<br /><br />I'm starting my 30 days of SAVERS tomorrow and will update once I'm finished.
1573226521|5|This may have been more of a 4.5-er for me, but I'm rounding up instead of down because it kept me so dang engrossed. I mean, I dreamt this thing at night, which was...well, not so pleasant, actually! It's one of those books where you know things aren't going to end so well, and you spend the entire time waiting to find out how exactly it's going to happen. The book depicts a slow disintigration--of community, of morality, of sanity, and of paradise. It's a mashup of Vietnam War movies, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, video games, and travel literature about unspoiled Edens, and half of it seems to take place in the alternate reality of main character Richard's headspace, which worked really well for me. I can see myself reading this again at some point down the line, and I am definitely looking forward to watching the movie, which I have never gotten around to doing (now I'm glad I waited). I'll definitely be checking out some of Garland's other novels as well.
B00CWY76CC|4|I really enjoyed this game.  It has multiple connecting puzzles/tasks in each level.  Unfortunately, there are only 10 levels at this time but looking forward to more &quot;coming soon&quot;!
B008Y7N7JW|5|Fast shipping and great product! I would recommend this movie to audiences between ages 10 and 18. I got it as a present for my 14 year old sister and she loves it.
B00FWLSLJ4|3|The action was somewhat entertaining, and the visuals were neat, but the movie was so ridiculously cheesy and corny. I almost feel like they were trying to be as corny as possible. I guess I figured that Guillermo del Toro wouldn't put out such a horribly corny movie. I stand corrected.
B008I15774|4|Carl Schuricht is far less well remembered than he should be.  A conductor of the more \\"classical\\" school of interpretation, he nonetheless leaned a bit more toward the \\"romantic\\" school than did like-minded colleagues such as George Szell, which was all to the good.  Apparently a humble man with strong institutional loyalties (both rare traits among podium maestros), he was content to remain and work with what were ranked second-tier institutions despite the recognition of his considerable interpretive gifts but his more famous colleagues, who held him in high esteem.  His conducting was marked by clarity and transparency of textures, finely gauged balance of orchestral voices, fluidity of phrasing, a sense of spontaneity and simplicity (in the positive sense of that term), and great integrity, with close fidelity to the printed score.<br /><br />This set brings together almost all of Schuricht's slender legacy for EMI -- his cycle of the Beethoven symphonies (partly monaural, partly stereo) with the Paris Conservatory Orchestra, and his three stereo Bruckner symphony recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic.  Inexplicably, it omits recordings of a couple of Mozart symphonies and a violin concerto, also with the Vienna Philharmonic.  (Some years back Decca release a five-CD set of his 1950s monaural recordings for that company, before it dropped him from its roster.)  Although the Paris ensemble was rightly regarded as second-rate even at its best, Schuricht had a longstanding and fruitful relationship with it, and managed to coax results from it here considerably beyond its norm.  These are wonderfully spirited and buoyant performances; Schuricht's approach to Beethoven is brisk, linear, and energetic. Those of the First, Second, Fourth, Sixth, and Seventh are almost playful; those of the Third, Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth create their drama by taut rhythmic drive instead of harmonic weightiness.  If the Ninth is a more lightweight account than that to which we mostly are accustomed, it has many of the virtues of period instrument performances without any of their drawbacks, and a solo quartet that, despite the lack of leading vocalists (except for bass Gottlob Frick), performs far better than many nominally more stellar foursomes.  For evenness of quality throughout, this is one of the best Beethoven cycles ever recorded; while no single performance ranks as a first choice, they are all very good, and unlike most sets there is not a single glaring weak link anywhere in it.<br /><br />Schuricht's Bruckner has long been held in high regard; I am in a minority in being less fond of these recordings of the Eighth (uncharacteristically rushed compared to his surviving live performances) and Ninth (solid but not exciting).  Those who disagree with me will naturally rate those recordings as a prime reason to acquire this set.  On the other hand, Schuricht's Bruckner Third was my introduction to Bruckner on LP as a teenager, following a televised Leonard Bernstein discussion and performance of just the first movement.  To this day I rank it alongside Eugen Jochum's DG recording as one of the two finest of this work ever made, a wonderfully dynamic performance that strips away accumulated layers of heavy varnish to reveal a Bruckner that has muscular litheness as well as transcendental power.  (Extraordinarily, the work was not previously part of Schuricht's repertoire, and he learned it just to make this recording.)<br /><br />EMI's Icon series is a super-budget edition that offers no new remasterings, though I am told that it re-licensed the studio version of the Beethoven Ninth back from the Testament label for this set.  In any case, the price makes this an easy investment even on an experimental basis.<br /><br />The Haenssler label has released two large boxed sets of 20 and 10 CDs (with many of those items also offered separately) of broadcast performances of Schuricht with his longtime ensemble, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony.  Those contain many notable performances, including seven Beethoven symphonies (all but #2 and #8) and five Bruckner symphonies (#4, 5, 7, 8, 9).  The Beethoven symphonies are generally very similar interpretively to the ones in this set, with slightly inferior playing and recorded sound.  The Bruckner performances of the Eighth and Ninth are to me much more interesting than the ones offered here, though again the recorded sound is inferior and the Eighth suffers some several cracked notes in the brass section.  My hope is that collectors will firs try this set, and then be as pleased with it as I am to try some of the Haenssler recordings and rediscover a superior but unjustly neglected conductor.

B0013N3DSE|5|A classic, wish they would release more on Blu-Ray
B0000508U6|1|Colplay is probably the best music you've ever heard if you never listened to another band's CD.  All four musicians wrote all of the tracks.  These brilliant songwriters have penned this stunning lyric on \\"Shiver,\\" \\"So I look in your direction, but you pay me no attention; I know you don't listen to me because you see straight through me.\\"  \\"How do you live as a fugitive?\\" Coldplay sings on the complex \\"Spies,\\" \\"I awake to see that no one is free.\\"  One excellent aspect of Coldplay is that their guitars are well-tuned.  On the moody \\"Sparks,\\" \\"I say ohhhhhhh\\" is the original lyric.  It's copyrighted; so don't try to steal it.  \\"Yellow\\" thunders for twenty seconds before giving way the pretty chorus where the singer's voice breaks momentarily into the upper register, \\"You know I love you so.\\"  The title track is less than a minute.  To toy with your mind, the song \\"High Speed\\" creeps along \\"before my head starts to explode.\\"  Coldplay's biggest problem is that they write their own songs which aren't very interesting and don't say much.  You have to give credit to them for selling a lot of CDs including the two in my collection.  I bought mine used.  Taxi!
B0013FXWU6|5|I was blown away by his performance. A Simple story of a man struggling to make a living without the support of a wife.... only a somewhat challenging child. What seems slow at first picks up the pace as new characters are introduced. It is then we get to see people's personalities evolve under changing circumstances. (The preacher man was a riot.)
B00IBZ5YKW|5|This story is a very touching story. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read Wonder. You will love it! I know I sure did!:)
044024238X|2|What a silly book!  I love Kinsella's other books, particularly the Shopaholic series, but geez...the situations in this book are laughable (and not because they're funny).  Although I made it through the book, it was not a pageturner and I was not drawn in by the characters or situations.  Even if you're a fan of Sophie's like I am, skip this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|This is the must read book. I love Sky and Holder, Holder was amazing, I loved their journey together the way that their love helped them through both of their struggles.<br />It was sad  and heartfelt. This book had it all. I just hope there will be a movie.<br />Their first kiss, that wasn't a kiss, amazing to read, loved how funny they both were. Colleen  Hoover is my new favorite author, great writing.

I paid for it and it was sent. EVERYTHING was going well and then I get an e-mail from them asking me if I enjoyed the product (which I found a little strange for I never gotten anything like this before when purchasing from amazon) in which I responded &#34; I never have gotten it in the mail&#34; The good thing was and I was happy about is they refunded my purchase price plus shipping. That I am happy for, but I have never had a problem with anything on amazon before. But, I'm very happy how they handled the issue.
B00FAXJHCY|5|Dind't catch me the first chapter and I actually even considered finding something else after the first few pages, but I am very happy that I did not! I give my warmest recommendations of the book - it's excellent.
B008673ZAQ|5|The saga continues. Eva and Gideon's story is hot. Miss Day delivered yet another wonderful book about these two characters, plus the people that surrounds them. Never a dull moment. Awaiting eagerly for the next chapter of Eva and Gideon's love story.

0679423001|4|The first two-thirds of \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is classic Evelyn Waugh, filled with wit and humor, fascinating characters and provocative scenes, and (above all) evocative description and meticulous prose. Waugh continues his tradition of skewering the pretensions and foibles of the aristocracy--although it's true the Oxford scenes are not as over-the-top as in \\"Decline and Fall\\" (Frank Kermode's introduction notes Waugh's acknowledgment of the 'mood of sentimental delusion' which pervades the work).<br /><br />I have the same reservations, however, about the third part of the book as did many of Waugh's contemporaries, including Edmund Wilson and Conor Cruise O'Brien. While the prose never falters and the \\"plot\\" is fascinating to the end, the satire is set aside for a moral, and your appreciation of the book may very well depend on whether you agree with its underlying religious message. To be sure, I really admire this book and continue to recommend it to everyone, but a second reading showcased what for me are shortcomings--flaws that make the work seem slightly less aesthetically pleasing than Waugh's earlier comic novels (particularly \\"Decline and Fall\\" and \\"Handful of Dust\\").<br /><br />Like, say, Flannery O'Connor or Graham Greene, who present their theology in the complexities of the characters' actions and motives, Waugh famously declared that he intended to show the \\"operation of divine grace on a group of diverse but closely connected characters.\\" Yet, where O'Connor and Greene use their stories to illustrate the subtleties of grace, Waugh seems to be making a case for it--but there are many passages that more convincingly show the operation of authorial, rather than divine, grace. And when he details conversations and debates on secular values and Catholic faith, Waugh can be a little heavy-handed--bordering on didactic. Throughout the dialogue the deck is loaded to demonstrate, for example, that Charles's milquetoast agnosticism pales in comparison to the richness of Catholicism.<br /><br />In fact, the problem with fiction as a vehicle for theological principles is that it can never truly show anything like \\"divine grace\\"; it's necessarily the author who determines what happens to the characters--and why it happens. While Lady Marchmain declares halfway through the book that \\"we must make a Catholic of Charles,\\" and while Julia's near-apostasy and Sebastian's alcoholism interfere with their spiritual salvation, it is ultimately Waugh--not God--who decides their various outcomes. (This dilemma is clearest during a deathbed conversion scene, which tell us everything about the author's hopes and \\"proves\\" nothing about faith. And this episode is based on a real-life occurrence in which, aside from the presence of God, Waugh himself played a coercive role.)<br /><br />This is not to say, however, that Waugh portrays his Catholic characters as saints or their actions as exemplary. Indeed, what saves the novel from becoming a catechism is that Charles, Julia, and Sebastian all are deeply flawed, at times disagreeable people. And, not ironically, the character who (in my mind) is the most lively and lifelike of the bunch is the irrepressible and unapologetic Anthony Blanche. In fact, one might even argue that Blanche's scene-stealing charm is \\"secular grace\\" working its inexorable way on Waugh himself.<br /><br />My comments here focus on only one theme--albeit a central one--in the novel. Most of the book, fortunately, is a comic excursion through a lost age and an elegiac ode to lost youth, as well as a thesis on divine grace. In the final analysis, it's impossible to ignore the beauty of the writing or underestimate the ability of this novel to make one ponder one's own secular or religious beliefs.atholicism.

B008JGSM6G|5|the early levels are easy but still great when you just want to calm your mind down from your days activities.  the water sounds are perfect and the higher levels are both challenging and satisfying - not to mention addictive.
B00CGYK9O0|5|I love these things... They are sticky enough to stay on but peel of easy to reuse them. I used them for a candy buffet for a party.... The chalk wipes off easy so you can change the name every time you change what's in the container.
B00BRUQ3PS|3|What can I say that hasn't already been said. Atwood is brilliant, creative. Oryx & Crake and Year of the Flood were haunting& provocative, but MaddAdam lacks the same longevity. I am glad to have learned more about the Crakers, Zeb, Toby. I am glad to know what happened to Jimmy & Adam One. But I found myself more amused than compelled by the trilogy's conclusion. A must-read with fans of the first two books, but unable to stand alone. Overall, an enjoyable read, but lacks the staying power of the 1st two.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book.  I just saw  that they are making it into a movie.  I hope it's as good as the book.
B0000DD7LB|3|a once over of the album, and 1,589 reviews later, I still don't think she can sing. she sucks. The only reason I gave the album 3 stars is for the producers and song writers and voice altering people that made her ish presentable.
B0052VUNHC|2|Okay I am only giving it two stars because I have to admit that at first I was really into it, but it just got so annoying towards the middle. It was just the same thing over and over again, they fight and make up and the guy is not believable I mean seriously he sounds so desperate it is so annoying. At first I thought he was sweet, he changed his bad ways for this girl but wow was I wrong. This book had a lot of potential, but I think the author ran out of ideas towards the end. Really its so immature, it would probably appeal more to high school girls, I doubt it would appeal to an adult because it is just really annoying. I am sorry I could not find a better word to describe this book, it is just annoying.
B00DJFIMW6|1|This app never worked.  When I tried to open after it had been installed a message appeared: Sorry does not work.
B00M7UTFW0|4|Really enjoyed this movie.<br />Overall there was too much darkness in the film.<br />The storyline seemed a great stretch.
B000002LCB|5|This Cd has everything, from soft romantic music to exciting, fast-paced music. It will suit almost any taste. The music was also very captivating. My favorite song was &quot;Come, My Love, I'll Tell You A Tale&quot;. It made me feel like I was right there in the action. I recommend it for lovers of the movie very highly!
B004SD5GZ4|5|Works good. No problems with this program. It helps with opening up alot of different programs. It helps with all books and emails.
B00000DFSK|5|U2 is the biggest group of both the 1980's and 1990's.  Their album Joshua Tree is widely acknowledged to be the best rock album since the Beatles broke up, at the very least.<br />The Best of 1980-1990, while lacking in the  sort of thematic connection and continuity present in Joshua Tree,  nevertheless succeeds greatly as an album by including other great U2 songs  which were on other albums.<br />The &quot;B&quot; sides on the second disc  are generally not of the same caliber as the hits on the first disc, though  some will certainly surprise you with their musical strength and  depth.<br />For U2 fans, there is no question that you must own this album.  For those who are just general fans of modern rock, this is one of two U2  albums you should definitely own (the other is Joshua Tree).
B003M6EAXM|5|Continued action, intense turn of events make Season 8 very hard to stop watching. I love how one episode leaves you intrigued for the next.. If you love following the clues... this show is for you!
B000667FN8|2|Shut Up!: This song is okay. It is about what it sounds like; leave me alone and let me be how I what to be. 2/5 <br /> <br />Welcome To My Life: Again, it's okay. But very basic idea for a song that every artist has written at least one about. 3/5 <br /> <br />Perfect World: Breakup song. Not the best. 2/5 <br /> <br />Thank You: Okay, I love this song. Its really poppy and a whole lot better than Perfect World. 3/5 <br /> <br />Me Against the World> I like this song too. I think its the theme song for Damage Control, but its a lot like Shut Up. 3/5 <br /> <br />Crazy: This song is not worth the time it takes to listen to it. 1/5 <br />  <br />Jump: Again not really worth the time, but not nearly as bad as Crazy. 2/5 <br /> <br />Everytime: Its OKAY.emphasis on okay. 2/5 <br /> <br />Promise: I love this song. Its the best one on the CD. 4/5 <br /> <br />One: I said Crazy wasnt worth the time it takes to listen to it, but this song is even worse than that. it should never have even been recorded at all. 0/5 <br /> <br />Untitled: Why didnt they just give this song a name? Was it that hard to come up with one at the time? But this song is okay. 3/5 <br />
B008XBCJ34|5|This is a great movie on all accounts, 3D and 2D!<br />When I first got my 3D Panasonic TV (2011 55GT31) a version (3D promotional disc only) of this movie came with the TV.  I played the 2D version in my old theater setup (2008 LG Plasma and Sony Bluray player) next to the new 3D setup (55GT31 and Pana Bluray player).  3D brings a whole new appearance to the movie- The flight scenes are realistic, the crowds of people look like a crowd of people.  Incredible movie to tryout your new 3Dtv (same with Despicable me, Lorax, IMAX under the sea movie, and many other newer movies.) Keep in mind that the Avatar promo disc (sold with TV's) was selling for $60 to $120 each on ebay and craigslist. So apparently someone was out loving and buying 3D movies then, and many more are now.<br />If you have had a bad experience with 3D at home, chances are that the TV was not setup for an optimal 3D experience, or it was a low end model with low end glasses (flicker and ghosting); And that also includes the setups at Best Buy- They crank up the TV with Vivid modes and has too much ambient lighting, that ruins the experience in my opinion.  You have to watch 3D movies more than once to gain an appreciation for 3D. I compare it to the difference of SD DVD's and HD Blurays.  Try a different manufacturers tv and glasses.  True, TV broadcast versions on Directv is not the greatest yet, but is still fun to see what is filmed in 3D.  I do not plan to watch Dora on TV, in 3D anytime soon.  We do watch at least one 3d movie per week (many good ones release all the time) in our house hold.<br /><br />The cost for 3D has dropped dramatically to make it work for all of us. You just have to buy smart to get it, as with anything in life.  I don't buy the  $36 version from Target.  Typically, I will buy my 3D discs from Amazon, under their preorder deal, and sometimes with Best Buy, which works great to get it at a great low price on the day of release.  I can usually get the 3D disc from $20 to $30 from this deal (usually $24). It comes with many multiple versions of the movie (3d, 2D-bluray, digital, UV, maybe DVD too).  Keep in mind that the \\"just released\\" 2D version is typically $23 - $30. If you wait till after the Preoder special, then it does go up to $33 or so, for the good movies.  GREAT DEAL from Amazon.<br /><br />Great 3D movie to go with your new 3DTV movie collection.  GET IT !!!
B0006VIE4C|5|this the movie that started all, this movie really change the world. You can find it here for cheap and fast delivery.
0790729725|3|A movie this great deserves a special edition DVD with more than a couple of trailers.  Plus, you have to turn the DVD over at a certain point in the movie.  I would wait for the re-issue, becase I'm sure that's gotta be in the works.  Hopefully they have plans for all Scorsese movies.  All the DVD's are bad, with the exception of the special edition of Taxi Driver.
B0002XDODU|5|wow....these guys never fail to amaze me...awesome...i never knew that Rammstein had a such a soft side although if u want..u can try for this Import cd called Ohne Dich(Maxi CD)which contains 5 different versions of the same song and each song was totally different really good. <br />Coming back to this album...these guys are good...My Fav Though was  the title song Reise Reise...go and buy this album..u wont regret unlike Mutter which so depressing...HAIL Speed metal gods from germany!!!
0316228583|5|This is the best book I've read in the past few years. The writing is brilliant. The characters and their individual voices are so well-formed and rich. I honestly could not put it down. I often read books and think, &#34;People don't really say that or act like that.&#34; Not so with this book. I felt the characters were spot on, and I could hear their individual voices. The story would seem to be incredibly dull by it's description, but it is captivating in it's web of characters and the masterful use of the English language. I dislike light weight stories and characters, and this book is anything but that. I recommend it to everyone, and will read it again myself.
B00000F1D3|3|No that bad... There are some nice songs found in this album but in the long run gets tiresome. It's quite of the same rhythm... Play, rewind, forward.... or skip it ;)
1848549245|5|The book addresses openly what is important in successful growth, and what is not important. It has great research of existing literature.<br />G. Sabataits
B000007T1M|5|Is it just me or when Rick Rubin hears a band play he probably hears these little voices telling him that if he produces their record they will be globally recognized for their talent. I'm talking about his part in the creation of Hip-Hop, finding faith no more and red hot chili peppers and now... System of a Down. This album has only 2 songs I did not really like but the rest of the album is done very nicely. They sort of combine heavy metal with a bit of arabic riffage on the guitars making a real good fast paced playin' band. The lead singer has a voice you just have to hear on the album for yourself. A good rock album that you can leave the whole thing playing.
B00HVJB4VM|4|A great read! Anyone who has ever invested or is considering investing in the stock market will want to read this book. An insider's view of the age-old problem of ways the stock market is &#34;gamed&#34; by those who are able to gain a knowledge and speed advantage over the average investor. The author knows how to spin a story; interesting characters, new technology, big money, fast life styles and computer nerds - lots of computer nerds! This book was a &#34;page turner&#34; and made even more exciting by being a true story. The central character Brad K would be a true hero in any book, the kind most likely to be played by Tom Hanks in the movie version. Thank you Michael Lewis for writing this book.
B009LDCZ7I|5|Awesome season and leaves you ready for the next one!!  Love the cds because they don't take up space on my iPad!
1476746583|5|Lots of history involved the plot
B0054JZC6E|5|I love it very very very very much this is a wonderful game ever . I want to okay it all the time.

B00FFHG6KQ|5|This game is the best 5 on 5 basketball game yet . Who doesn't want this game? The only thing I don't like is the graphics. Other than that this is the best game ever made.
B004EC5IUW|5|I'll make this short this Item can be enjoyed by fans of the Evangelion franchise but It can be also enjoyed by any anime enthusiast who out there looking for a awesome animated movie......you know what just stop reading this message and go and Buy this awesome BD you will not regret it.
B00CWY76CC|4|Love it can't wait for the new boards!!!!! Great game to keep your brain stimulated...... please release the new boards
B000JMKTLO|4|Similar to the other two books
B001NLKT60|4|Not as fasted paced as I usually like until the very end but still a good read with good character devo
B002UNMW7O|5|Excellent movie!! Action!!!
B00FMQINEM|5|This is an amazing product!!!  my daughter absolutely loved it!! Put it on a month ago and not one single thing has peeled  up or come off!! Colors are beautiful and vivid!!!!
0375422307|5|The story of a young a girl during the Iranian revolution and into wartime with Iraq is at times touching and funny, and at others absolutely horrifying. Satrapi truly captures the nature of these difficult times without pandering to emotion or losing the innocence of a child's point of view. The story is split into 'chapters' which can sometimes make the story seem a little disjointed, but never enough to really distract. The artistic style is simple but effective, and really captures some of the more surreal moments, such as her conversations with God. Definitely a must read.
B0052RE4MQ|4|Pretty good story line. Kept me interested and wanting to read more. I am now on the last book of the series
B00PE26G7U|3|Good quick read
0156027321|2|I pick this book up thinking I would read something that had lots of meaning, or at least some fresh insights into religion, beliefs, fate or something of this nature. The more I read the more I knew that this book did not have it. Maybe I was mislead by the hype surrounding this book. <br /> <br />Another review talks about how they felt that this was actually 2 books put together and I think this is dead on. The \\"before\\" the boat and the \\"during\\" the boat. When the part about being on the boat came I was like, \\"ok, here comes the meat of the story where all the spiritual stuff, enlightenment, all the metaphors for life will be found\\". I was wrong. Its just about him being on the boat and the survival things he has to go through, like food, water, the sun, the tiger. Thats it.  <br /> <br />The ending is not much better. I did not fear like the character learned ANYTHING about his experience except maybe that he felt damn lucky he survived. Big whoop!  <br /> <br />This book had so much potential its not even funny. I read the book and was SO disappointed that this potential was wasted completely. I really don't understand the praise and awards this book receives. <br /> <br />course I could be wrong, this is just my opinion
B00009XITQ|5|Hello everyone.  I saw this movie first in TV in Iceland where I am born.  I saw it 2 times and really enjoy it.  I really want to buy it and what was the best place to look at.  Yes you are right.  Amazon.com  I search there and found it and order it right away.  I was so happy when I got it and I can watch it over and over again.    I like this story because it is so innocent, but so true and everyone live happily ever after.  Great story, good actors, lovely places where it is filmed.  Thanks. Rosa in Iceland.
B002NXZY8K|5|Scorsese is a cinematic genius...it is a masterpiece everyone should see this film i got an A in my film class from this movie
B00H2EQFBK|5|This show is a more humble version of game of thrones to me(without all the magic and dragons though). The characters are interesting and dynamic. And the plot is twisty all of which make it a great show. Excited to continue watching
B006T9PI5I|4|Great watching this old classic.  Sometimes the British is hard to understand, but the picture was remastered and seems a lot crisper.
B007J4T2G8|5|Awesome
B00BFUUMO8|5|I love games where you get to build parks and such. This is one of the best ones I  have found for the Kindle Fire. There is money you can buy with real money but if you aren't impatient the dinosaurs make money pretty fast. I love it
B00EPFEY44|4|We both like the tunes from his album.
B0059R5Q08|5|Love this version. Wish I had bought it in blueray though. The lighting in this movie is spectacular!
B0017VG69U|5|GREAT STUFF NEVER WILL GET OLD. EACH TRACK HAS GREAT EFFECTS. MUST HAVE FOR ANY TRECKY. KEEP THEM COMING THX.
B00AN0KBJC|5|Awesome season, can't wait to read the books.  The video quality could have been better, but the Wii is not know for HD streaming ability.
B00IEBE7GK|5|I loved every minute of this game!  Did not have the trouble others had with the game.  Recommend to everyone that likes solving mysteries.
B003EV6DBM|2|With Series Five, at least for our family, Saturday nights were set aside for watching Doctor Who. However, as the season progressed, we found ourselves actually forgetting to watch. The stories were just not intriguing enough to keep us interested.<br /><br />As for Matt Smith, I loved him. He is cute and reminiscent of Tom Baker enough to engender a love of him in the role. However, while Karen is a good actor, I did not care for her character at all and I especially hated her too short mini skirts.<br /><br />All in all, I think I will purchase a couple of the Tom Baker episodes rather than the Fith Series. Hopefully, the next season will be an improvement.
B003ODIZL6|1|That is five days I will never get back but it was worth it not I give it four stars
B004EPZ06Q|1|UltraViolet digital download is no good, you have to create accounts and it will not work with itunes. In order to watch the movie on your computer you have to download a software, you can only watch using their software or stream onto devices. I made the mistake of purchasing the Green Lantern with UltraViolet and learned the hard way. Buy just the BluRay.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|John Grisham brought back some of my favorite characters in this book.  I was captivated from the 1st to the last word.
0062086529|5|I'm trying to read more books from my to-read list and I happened to see Harold and the Purple Crayon at the library.  It was on my to-read list only because it was mentioned on Gilmore Girls.  But my 4 year-old son saw it and wanted to read it with me.  So we read it together and he enjoyed it a lot.  Which of course means we read it about 5 more times.  It is an adorable, creative book with a cute message about imagination and finding home.  My review is probably longer than the book itself, but the day after I read this book to my son, I found a huge stack of drawings, all in purple, and they are clearly inspired by the book.  It was touching to me that a book would stick with him that much.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|I would highly recommend it, It is full of action and twists and turns. It is one of my favorite shows.
B0034DGPEU|4|Entertaining read!
B00CSR2J9I|5|Love this app. it is very addicting and it is very hard to close your kindle tablet and quit playing it since it is so fun.
B0054JZC6E|5|kills time love that there's so many games! I want more! need lots and lots more games! kids and I both try to get higher in levels?
B00AESN8XY|5|I remember playing pandemic 2 on the computer, and I was so excited to find a game just like that for my tablet, which caught me by surprise that this version is ten times better. The game will make you want to be on the app for hours on end. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games or just wants to pretend your a evil genius bent on wiping out humanity...
B00AZMFO6I|5|Such a great movie... Love Maggie Smith ! ! !
6301954947|5|This movie is war classic.  Rod Steigers best performance.  Christopher Plummer is great. I love soundtrack. I have the used VHS but it going bad.  Hopefully released on DVD in widescreen soon.
B00GFHFRNM|5|Amazing and thrilling end to a magnificent trilogy. Sad that it has ended although my imagination lives on thru Deborah Harkness' characters. Highly recommended!
B004VMVTNU|1|this has been on the amazon appetite free app of the day once before. didn&apos;t like it then... don&apos;t like it now.
B00CS65JS2|4|My son had been nagging me to download this album for him, and I'd put it off for awhile. The differences in tempo and style threw me a little the 1st time I previewed the album.  The tracks have a different feel, but its still Daft Punk. Its a departure, but good.
B0001NBMBC|5|Slipknot has really shown how awsome they are in this album. Slipknot shows just how hard they are in the song Welcome. The two songs Circle and Vermilion,Pt.2 shows how beautiful this album is. This is the best album slipknot has come out with and you would be crazy not to get this disc.
B0044C5SCU|3|JJ Abrams has a habit of overextending the life of his shows through ridiculously random plot twists (see Lost). Show pretty much should have ended in this season. instead they throw in alot of random occurrences and fabricate a new extended storyline to extend for multiple seasons.
B00BB8T9FC|5|Very good movie. This was probably the 5th or 6th time watching it
B00G6ZTM3Y|1|I have already created my character on my kindle fire but when I tried to play again today it crashed and it keeps crashing please fix.
0316067598|5|When I was a kid every adult male I knew fought in World War II.  I had an uncle in the Pacific and one in the Battle of the Bulge.  I read Guadalcanal Diary and To Hell and Back.  While maybe a stern edit of this book might be in order, I believe Lone Survivor will become a classic like the ones I mentioned.  Let's put politics aside because from what I  gather from reading the reviews, liberal anti Bush folks hate this book.  Frankly, the end is a bit gushy even for me, but the battle narrative is riveting and that is why you would buy the book. To be sure, a bad decision put the team at risk but from what I have been told and from what I have read, in WWII the goat herders would have been killed and forgotten in a minute.  That said, the selfless heroism and the honor shown among the SEAL team is extraordinary and I would urge young people to read about it since actually finding these qualities in American culture today would be exceedingly rare.
0062190377|2|Fantastic concept but reads like a textbook. Slow developing. Hard to keep interest. Extremely long chapters.
B0015D3Z4O|5|Confectionery magnificence... This collection marries the old with the innovative, cutting edge sound and stylization we've come to expect from her Madge-esty! It's all about the dancing, from beginning to end... no deep thoughts, no preaching or teaching or solving the world's issues... just good old-fashioned dance floor escapism! She's got the beat and she's perfectly on target with this latest offering... HC will translate well in all of the countries where Madonna rules the charts and club scenes... brilliant marketing as always and very universal in its appeal, recapturing the American audiences of past, to boot! (BTW... Nice Boots!) Watch her as she breaks even more records for music sales, digital and traditional, plus stay tuned as her forthcoming tour shatters all existing records as well... \\"goody-goody gumdrops\\" this Hard Candy is red-hot cinnamon, with great surprise at the center of each colorful lollipop (how many licks does it take?) and the flavor, just like the beat goes on and on and on!     Turkish Delight was never quite this good!    Bravo!!!!!
0762434260|3|bought this item locally mostly for the handle. If you have some form of wood clay and a wooden dowel of appropriate size with minimal work you cam remake the wand haft out of actual wood and use the clay for the wider part. MUCH more durable for kids that way than this or even the licensed reproductions.<br /><br />As for the product itself -  its closer in size to what the books say it should be, around 11 inches. And if you can either redo the haft as i said a above or clean it up a bit with filler and paint to be used as a desk display its great for that.
B00M4ADWQ8|5|Angelina Jolie just chews this role up, she was incredible and the ending was terrific. Special effects are stupendous.
B004J1DBJI|5|worth the little bit of money--in fact worth a TON more!  I say buy it and you will be surprised how much this thing can do.
B00005Y6YB|5|One of my favorite books of all time, and by far the best western books written.  You will not regret reading this, it is a truly great book!
B007R11DKQ|4|It has the good boy and girl, the bad witches, a mad king with seven or was it eight unfortunate sons.  Add in a little stardust and you have an interesting fantasy.  There is the earthly village and the forbidden realm beyond the stone fence.  It all makes for a fun film.
B0036TGT3E|5|I love being able to get Disney movies without having to pay an arm and a leg for them at the store.
B0086700CM|5|I haven't had any problems with this app! It is very fast on my Kindle Fire and it works great!
B003B02O14|4|Grisham is always great..  The ending was just as expected but I was hoping for an unexpected one..  .
B00002SSRZ|1|I borrowed this disc from my sister to see if it was worth laying out a premium for it in the aftermarket.  Buyer beware...this is a poor production.  The bass is almost non-existent.  The highs are overblown and the mix unto itself is bizarre.  If you want to pay a premium for an audiophile version of Abraxas then treat yourself to the stereo SACD.  It's really ashame as this would have been great album in 5.1 if done properly.
B00005MKA1|5|Kaya is a pleasure from start to finish.  As usual, the remastering further enhances the listening experience.<br /><br />And again this album is full of Marley songs the average listener has probably not heard.  Well worth the money.<br /><br />5 Stars all the way.
B001F0VHEM|5|This is a great CD!  I think it is her best CD yet.  I can listen to the whole cd top to bottom, and love all the songs.  Great Lyrics!
0575081406|2|I think that the book has its merits, but they are lost on with a onslaught of words. I understand charter building, but this book just goes on and on and on. Save your time and buy the First law series. Although if you like a meandering book, go for it.
B0000AQS0F|5|I can't articulate myself like some people, so I'm just going to keep it simple (this was mainly just to give Firefly another 5 star review).  It doesn't matter how you get a hold of this series, but I urge you to watch this masterpiece.  It is enthralling, witty, imaginative, and like nothing I have ever seen.  You won't be able to stop watching, and that's exactly how a tv show should be...addicting!
B001O03NCW|5|this movie  was great. i love to watch it over and over.this was my dads favored movie and horry potter
0553551620|5|Gripping. Hard to put down.  And the best part?  A TRUE story. Excellent book.
B0036TGT3E|5|Bought as a Xmas gift for my wife. She loves the movie and I go on trips to Africa so it's a great movie and especially on bluray it was a great deal on a Disney movie. Since Disney is expensive couldn't pass up on it. Came in new condition and worked great.
B0051UP5NQ|5|Perfect word editor
B000005H7D|5|Coltrane is like a god of thunder, he roars, he cracks and whips music around, this is essential brothers...
B00EFNXPFK|4|I'm a huge John Mayer fan, but this sounds an awful lot like born and raised. I like most of the songs, but it get's kind of boring. It's great background music for work though. I like Frank Ocean as a guest singer, but Katy Perry is a little bit to dramatic with her guest vocals. Call me the breeze is great too. It is a great version and I think JJ Cale would be proud. I don't think the magic of his first few albums is gonna happen again.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|This is a crazy fun app but they need to start working on hard mode but still one of the best apps
B000VOC90Y|3|This pack does not stand upright as advertised; it even had a separate tag on it that says it does. It doesn't even set on its bottom at all, it falls forward no matter how I arrange the contents. My last bag of the same model did the same thing. The bag lasted 8 years of daily lugging which is remarkable. The durability motivated me to check out Wenger's new line up and I was encouraged to see the claim that the issue was improved. It is an absolutely empty claim. It was packaged with the flimsy bottom panel bent around the front of the bag which didn't help. I was going to return it but kept it based on the durability of its predecessor but I really wished it would just set upright.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|Makes your brain work!
B00BAXFAOW|3|I have read all of Malcolm Gladwell's books and watched an interview and discussion on TV about his latest book.  Written well, however I failed to connect with the subject matter.  I see him as a one of the great author's of our time.
0385349947|5|Every woman should read this and use it as their professional bible.  Even if you're not in the work force, you need this to help others who are.  Buy it as a gift and you will be remembered and can change lives for the better.
B00BVYNSLC|3|Truth be told, I am past 60, so that I would really like this series...probably not so much. I admit that I enjoyed the first two or three episodes, but then got - yup - bored. The premise is good. The acting, fine. It just never developed from the same old same old. Young primary character, lower class orphan from  Britain with associated accent passing herself off as tough NY cop whole dodging bullets, etc. from various other clones and mysterious characters while hanging with openly gay brother - quite a good actor whose talents are wasted on this series - all the while trying to get a wad of stolen cash together to escape with daughter left with former foster mom.  Great plot that just sits and sits and I finally gave up and didn't finish watching it.
B003TSEEDY|4|I thought the book was well written but I honestly liked the movie a lot more which is rare. It's usually the other way around when a movie is based on a book. But overall I still enjoyed the book.
B00DVKOYBM|4|I wish the server would stay out of the game.it appears when the server do not want you when they but in and take your. shot away claiming. you ran out of time.that really. ducks.
0804178747|3|Not as good as the old Jack Reacher novels.  Not enough of Jack pummeling the villians.  Always like it when Jack gives them what they deserve.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I am enjoying this game p)<br />it has be e. thrilling and very enjoyable j like that ut has sevrsl games wiithun a game
B00A0SJWQU|5|enjoyed a lot , fast moving and wow this actor did well in action before seem out of his element, see in action did well
B008JGSM6G|2|I can't play this correctly  whoever made this should have added some pizzazz to it for kids and even though its supposed to be like that also try not to make it hard to play
B00M4ADWTK|5|Excellent movie!!!
B00HHJPUFM|4|It was so funny! From 39 all the way to 4 years old- all were amused!  Don't think an Eminem song should be connected with any kids movie but otherwise good pick.
B0083P1QUM|5|Always good
B00R3DOCJM|3|There are 4 good things about this film. The first one is the engaging special effects. They keep me interested till the end. The second is the fighting scenes especially the one at the end of the film. It’s exciting and somewhat suspenseful.  There is no nudity and foul language. They are the remaining good things.   There is very little character development except the one that deals with greed. It shows gold does change people. However, the development is too brief to make a long lasting impression. So, this picture is not as deep as Lord of the Rings.   According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this picture as of March 9th, 2015  Production Budget: N/A  Domestic:   $254,696,686      + Foreign:   $700,000,000      = Worldwide:   $954,696,686    Wow! It took in more than 950 million dollars! Very few movies did that.   According to slashfilm dot com/the-hobbit-budget/ posted on Wednesday, October 22nd, 2014 by Germain Lussier,  the budget for The Hobbit Trilogy was probably around 800 million dollars.   Based on that figure, this last Hobbit film took in more than 3 times its costs. What an investment!   In short, it’s worth watching as a family movie even though it fades from my mind the minute I walk out of the theatre.
B007VUCAVO|5|I have tried a few different battery apps and in my opinion this one is the best! Worth the money.
B00I29VGMC|5|Wow... This book demands your emotionally investment! Seriously though, how can you not fall completely in love with these two tortured souls?.. I love how their pain and struggles were so real and vivid. Archer is the definition of  the old saying &#34;Never judge a book by its cover&#34;..  Fantastic read!
B008MG1E4A|4|Good, easy read.
B00005MP58|5|The constant day to day social toil of the gentleman's class rings true and brings light humor to loves found and lost, Austen portrayed and comes off the page well, supporting cast brilliant and always acting takes turns for the better to heighten some of the absurdity of the conflicts, boxed 2-DVD set in good condition and packaged well, delivered in time promised.
B006E4QCXU|5|I would definantly pay for this app if I didn't get it for free. This app is phenomenal on the kindle fire and the colors are awesome. Get it. Get it. Get it.
B00005J6T1|4|Mmmmmmmmmadonna. You never forget the early eightees (1982,1983) just before the Like a Virgin CD when she`s exploded into popheaven with here first album, just before the CD revolution with the Album Madonna:The first album. Simple earcandy popmusic to make youre day happy in \\"pleasentville \\". It kicks off with the funky and realy right to the point  Track 1 song Lucky star, and this has the most for you and the ghost, because she`s already there shows the great potensial how a good ear for how a hit song should sounds like. Track 2 Borderline, is more in the borderline country, with not so much to shout hurray for (there goes the 5 star, sorry to say). This is of course quality all over, but not up to Track 1 standard. Track 3 Burning Up, is more like a \\"flashdance\\" song, with it`s more rock and roll disco hybrid sound. It`s how disco should sound`s like and a potensial winner on the dancefloor. Very melodious to sum it up in a simple way. Track 4 I know it it`s more traditional, and is a minor let down. It`s very tiny, with an irritating saxophone in the background. Track 5. Well. Heeeeeeey. It`s time for a Holiday, and this one realy sparks and shines.<br /><br />A simple refrain, and gives hope for all happy shiny people out there. Holiday. A song to realy celebrate. In other words: A classic. The ultimate popsong. Track 6 Think of Me, is more in discoland once again, and it`s funky enough, but not a classic. It`s anyway cool enough. Track 7 Physical attraction. Well it`s once again in funky discoland, but doesn`t take off into pleasureland, but a good earfiller anyway. Track 8 Everybody, is a synthpop classic, with \\"teen pleasure\\", for the young at heart. It has a refrain which is effective, but not much more, sorry to say. This CD one is anyway earcandy from you ears. The remaster version has two new version of two of the hits. Ive have the original, and im courious why they put them in , but maybe theire would give you more values for the money.
B000I3W1XS|4|I think the love between Bones and Spock is very sweet.  Men in the 80's seldom showed this kind of vulnerability then.  Again, this franchise is ahead of its time.
B005SV9X22|5|Pre-Ordered this for my dad as a gift and he Loves it, even brings it to my house so I can watch some of her performances, and I even enjoyed it. I would recommend this video to anyone that is a Lady Gaga fan like my dad is! Arrived Quickly!
B000BO0LLS|5|The hits It's Like That, We Belong Togeterher, Shake It Off and Don't Forget About Us, no need to say anything cuz everyone already knows. But other than those 4 songs, this album is like a treasure of wonderful songs probably many of them won't get released as singles and people who didn't buy this CD won't listen, which will be a huge loss for them. So to add the glory of \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Say Something\\", \\"Stay The Night\\" (Kanye West produced), \\"Circles\\", \\"Joy Ride\\", \\"Fly Like A Bird\\" (one of the best Gospel affords lately) and all others to your ears, just buy this! You won't be disappointed.
B009NQKPUW|4|I chose this rating because while it keeps you in suspense,  it also is somewhat predictable.  I loved much of it.  It was guy oriented.  Gory in parts.  Tender in parts.  I thought it was a GOOD evenings entertainment.
B003M70O5O|5|EXCELLENT SHOW GOING TO MISS IT !!!
B00AB7HESI|5|This game is FANTASTIC!!! My friend got this game for me for Nintendo DS, and I loved it. Now I've got it on my kindle and it's AWESOME!!! Plus it's bigger;):D. Also I recommend this game. It's mostly about adjectives.
B00009NHC5|5|I discovered that the person who wrote Hitchcock's Dial D for Murder also wrote this story. You can tell because this story takes place in an apartment. I enjoyed this film very much. It is a blind woman who has to deal with three dangerous criminals who are after a doll filled with drugs. Every scene keeps you to the edge of the seat, and its last fifteen minutes or so, are even more enthralling.
B004RJMUJO|2|its cool at first and really easy to stack up points. the only thing that makes you want to play this is if you have openfeint to track friends highscore. other than that this game gets old quic.
B00COMLLX2|2|Game just has too much clutter. Too hard to follow the ball. How I long for the old Microsoft game.
B005LAII6M|1|I am a hardcore fan of the R.E. games, but this franchise is taking a skydive in the movie sector.  This latest movie was just flat out bad.  they keep repeating the same formula from the last few movies to exhaustion. (slow motion blood splatter, boss monsters, and that lame annoying albert wesker character)  this is the 5th entry to the franchise i think and the story goes no where, same platform, same incomplete ending that leaves it open for yet another movie ...enough already it's  really getting sad.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Not too bad! I enjoy hidden object games and the fact that I have to wait for my energy to reboot actually works for me because it forces me to take a break. Lol!
B009FZHYKU|5|So far this season is my favorite. Each week I find myself counting down till Sunday night. :-)  It gets better & better with each episode!
B006UKFFE0|5|I've read a ton of stuff on lean start-up, but I feel this book is particularly valuable because it makes everything actionable. It is a  quick read- I  read it on a plane- but is also useful as a reference. I've recommended the book to at least 4 people, and 3 of them have read at least some of it and found it useful.
1433502410|5|I bought them for gifts when my Pastor told me that Life Application wasn't a literal translation from Hebrew and Greek. I don't want someone's opinion; I want a direct translation that is word for word.
B001E5CH0G|5|Great Movie - delivered quickly!
B005F3XV62|5|MY GRANDCHILDREN COULDN'T QUIT LAUGHING AT THIS MOVIE. IT IS FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING. WE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS ONE. HAD TO HAVE ONE FOR EACH HOUSEHOLD. RECOMMEND.
B00006JY0R|5|Love this movie!
B0031RSA24|5|I have a huge amount of respect for Sir Richard Dawkins, his works and tireless attitude towards his writing and educating others is something I truly admire. Reading this book completely changed my life and opened up my mind and eyes to my brainwashing as a child from my religious upbringing and enabled me to finally admit to myself the truth about my beliefs. I highly recommend this book from this fantastic man . It might just change your life too !
B007EC27QM|5|just what i need. straightforward. easy to use. great big buttons cant miss. you will use it all the time.
B00DHKKN6Q|5|great game good for down time really makes you brain think love playing this game thanks for creating this and you might wanna get some new colored balls
B000WGWQG8|5|For years, my view of John Adams were he was one of our greatest presidents even though most \\"experts\\" disagreed. I knew the man was a genius and his positions were right for the nation. However, he lacked people's skills and weren't able to push his agendas successfully in Congress. The problem with Adams was he served between Washington and Jefferson-two giants who legacies have only grown despite many of their own faults. Adams, after over 200 years, is finally having the last laugh (thanks to this series).     This series does a great job in showing the man behind the presidency. The series also shows his shaky relationship with Jefferson and his part in the establishment of our nation. However, the best part of this series is it shows his relationship with his wife. She was truly his rock and his equal. Many people talk about Elenaor Roosevelt and Hillary Clinton changing the role of \\"First Lady\\" but I think Abigail Adams already did that.    Great and important series!! This is a MUST HAVE for all Americans and historians (big and small). John Adams died the same day of Jefferson on July 4th and he proclaimed \\"Jefferson lives\\". After this series, its time for us to proclaim \\"Adams live\\"!!
B000006TRV|4|The Wall has been described as one of the greatest albums of all time and a roadmap to suicide. These two facts hold true on Floyd's '79 effort; one of the darkest most influential albums ever. From the haunting vocals on Another Brick in the Wall all parts to the funky slide guitar on young lust (the album's only upbeat happy effort and it rocks!) to the rhythm guitar on Run Like Hell this album flat out rocks. Buy it if your new to Floyd and the whole depressing aspect doesnt bother you. If it does bother you and your new to Floyd pick up Dark Side of the Moon or Wish you were Here which are definently on par with the Wall.<br />&quot;...all in all your just another brick in the wall...&quot;
B001GCUER0|5|I'm slowly catching up with this show because, not only are the plots/sets/characters completely amazing, but the audio commentaries by creator Matthew Weiner are really insightful and hilarious to listen to while re-watching the episodes. I love when people refer to this show as \\"boring\\". It immediately lets me know that we are not going to get along (unless they're really hot, and then I can fake a conversation, just like on the show). With the exception of \\"Breaking Bad\\", I can't think of a higher quality show that's currently on TV.
B00BHHIWQO|4|this is fun and fast....something I can spend as much or as little time that I have.  I find it challenging and addicting.  I would highly recommend this game!
B00AO2T9VU|5|It took a little while for this album to grow on me. It doesn't have the same raw energy as Happiness; the sound is more refined and mature. It's a great album overall, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the moody electronic sounds of The XXs, Portishead, and even a bit of Placebo.
B00F35P69C|4|Love it!!
B0090KZDSK|5|I love the crossfire series! So amazing! It keeps me turning the paging and going on this journey with Eva and Gideon. Thank you Sylvia day!
B007PT3QOQ|5|don't listen to any of the other reviews. they. updated today and it works perfect. I need this app on all kindle if they are I n my class we are learning about this today
B00386EZJU|5|I don't think I could add anything to Jon Broxton's excellent review if I sat in front of the computer for a month.  So let me just add my name to those who think this is one of the finest scores ever written for an animated movie.  Maybe the best I've ever heard.  A good friend of mine, a bona fide movie soundtrack dweeb (and I mean that as a high compliment), told me he did something last year he hadn't done in eons.  Immediately after seeing the movie, he went straight to the nearest music store and purchased the soundtrack.  I bought it a short time later based solely on his recommendation - I hadn't seen the movie yet - and I can only say his glowing review of the music was an understatement.  It's magnificent, the best score I've heard since Howard Shore's work for the LOTR trilogy.  I wasn't surprised HTTYD didn't win the Oscar for best original score - they hardly ever get it right.  But I have no qualms saying it was far superior to anything else from 2010.    One more thought:  I'm glad this is on CD.  Had it been on vinyl I would have worn it out several times.
B001ILHY1I|4|I've never been a fan of futuristic movies, with there usual weird clothing made out of plastic rings from 6 packs and held together with large safety pins.  This movie was different and truly enjoyable, in spite of some of the more gory scenes.  It was a good story to begin with, set not that far into the future.  2012 is described to have some social issues that are already in play now, in 2009.  I'm a grandmother, but I thought this movie was a fun ride.  Jason Statham is my new favorite movie hero.  The support cast was great and Joan Allen - well, it was not the same Joan Allen from \\"Peggy Sue Got Married\\" or even \\"Faceoff\\" - who knew she could play such a quiet, yet lethal, villain.  I think I enjoyed the fact that stunts were real and CGI was limited.  A true action movie with plenty of action.  I thought it was great and can't wait for my husband to see it too.
B00KG2RI9I|4|Great rendition of a classic monster movie. Solid storyline, epic shots alongside well considered details. I wish they showed more Godzilla, the movie should almost be called Mothra.
B001I189MQ|5|Great movie worth watching over and over again.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|There are a lot of stupid games that try to do this way of playing but this game is so much better than all of them it's like call of duty but blockey amazing app my name is Master Chief

B00005JKQZ|5|Despite what others said, I think this is one of the greatest films I have seen in years!  Definitely deserve an Oscar.
B005UBNL0A|3|I got a new motherboard and replaced my  q2300 Intel 2.5ghz quad core with this and it gave me the same windows experience index after redoing the test. Benchmarks also tend to put it behind phenom 2 cards. Its not bad but don't be fooled by 3.6ghz as this is not a true quad core. Look it up for yourself. Not bad deal but don't expect a huge leap in performance. I now have the [[ASIN:B0056D5AMY AMD Phenom II X4 960T Processor, Black Edition, 3.0 4 Socket AM3 - HD96ZTWFGRBOX]] and they are equivalent in the windows experience index at stock clocks. Know what you are getting.
B00BVYLBP2|5|Amazing!! I was hooked from the first episode and I am definitely not a sci-fi kind of girl! But this show is great!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5|Great game for keeping your entertainment needs and brain function active. The longer and further you go the faster it gets. Have fun
0062306812|4|Lots of period detail with well drawn characters and a good plot - however, I found the novel a bit long.

B005CRQ3NY|5|I loved it. It was hysterical . AWESOME funny  .Oh how funny it was. And it taught me something but we all know what it is so why wast time knowing what it
B000TGCR38|5|I can't wait to watch this again.  A very moving and entertaining movie.  Great acting, good cast and based on a true story.

B00OC7MHZ8|5|This new album is candy to my ears! As good as or better then Black Ice!
B00CH26TL8|1|I just didn't like this game.  The aiming and shooting is really awkward.  There are many bubble games out there that are more fun to play.
B00A6CCF0K|4|King took a long time writing a sequel to The Shining, one of my very favorite of his works.  While this book doesn't live up to the frightening original, it was still enjoyable to read.  It must be extremely difficult to come up with ideas that aren't just slight variations of an earlier book he has written.  I hadn't read any of King's books since the late 1980s, and he is still an excellent author … and I'm sure one of America's most successful.<br /><br />Though this book is about little Danny from The Shining as a grownup, I felt like King included too many references to the earlier work.  Possibly he felt that many of today's readers wouldn't have read The Shining, but at times, it almost seemed like it was a way to fill pages.  Dr. Sleep is still a very good read, however!<br /><br />I found King's notes after the end of the book to be quite informative.
0062255657|4|I may be biased due to being a Gaiman fan, I bought this without reading what it was even about......  Regardless of that, I truly did enjoy this story. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is shorter that I thought it would be based on his past books. In no way is this a bad thing other than I wish I had more.<br /><br />The main character is a seven year old boy who gets wrapped up in a frightening and fantastical situation that leaves him wanting everything to go back to the beginning. While you may think this sound like a basic, vague explanation, you're right it is. Neil Gaiman is able to make a basic premiss into a wonderful and (on some level) personally touching story. He is able to keep it simple while guiding you though a maze of emotions. At the end I was left feeling sad, empty, warm, and happy all at the same time. The only explanation is wizardry. Ultimately, my review is if you're a Gaiman fan, yes. If it is your first try, yes. Then keep going, you wont be sorry.
B00005JMFO|5|I just saw this movie (screening) a few hours ago.  It is such a great movie.  I walked into the movie theater with no idea what the movie was about.   I left feeling so good.  This movie made me laugh and cry.  It also made me sad and happy.  It tells short stories of different people that are somehow connected but not really.  There is lots of love in this movie.  From family love to romance.  I have got to see this movie again as soon as it is released!  You must see this movie.  Wow!!!  I love this movie.  Did I mention that I love this movie?  Enjoy!!!
B00687PWQG|5|I learned a lot about the events that followed the US Independence and its characters in a very gratifying way. Recommended to anyone who is interested in history.
B00PTB7B34|5|Great game. Just what I've been looking for.
B004QSQMKE|2|I thought the soundtrack in the original version was much better than Director's Cut. For that reason alone, I rate this version as inferior to the original release movie-goers version.
B007JM4CWY|1|really boring game. I don't like puzzles espescially when I'm trying to relax. deleted in approxamately 57 seconds. so yeah.. :-(
B005PR44XC|4|Typical Lewis -- easy to read but packs a good dose of unwelcome but necessary-to-know data.  Read it and then go out and insult a banker!
B0044RFT8S|5|We've watched both the DVD and the Blu-Ray discs (over & over & over again, haha), they work great (we bought used). I like that there are no real 'scary' parts to it. She is only 2 1/2, so there are some movies that when the villain shows up she yells 'Scared!' and makes darn sure I am in the room with her for those 'scary' parts. but I don't worry about this movie giving her any nightmares, etc. She loves this movie, & mommy & daddy laugh all the way through it too.

B00EV1YZ96|5|The color is pretty and the movie very enjoyable.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Awesome awesome. This game is the same thing as globally bird. This game is awesome. I would recommend this game to any one
B004DI7HZ6|5|This book is my absolute favorite book. I have read it 3 times now. I love the characters and I love the story.  It makes it seem like witches, vampires and daemons could exsist in real life.  I have had the 2nd book preordered since the day I could order it. I was so surprised to see the bad reviews. The only thing I can think of the people wouldn't like is all the history in the book.  I loved it!!

0439023521|1|This series is *trying* to be in the same vein as 1984, Brave New World, Lord of the Flies, Battle Royale, and Jennifer Goverment. However, it flops as far as execution. It is obvious that the goal of Hunger games, like the previously mentioned books, is attempting to create a dystopian world that is based off of a flaw of currently existing government, and set to highlight this flaw.<br /><br />There is a major defect though in the way the book pursues this....<br /><br />It never shows any flaw with the original system.<br /><br />With 1984, the problem is \\"A government that views it as okay to monitor it's citizens' loyalty above all else.\\"<br /><br />With Brave New world, the problem is \\"Government feels its okay to make decisions for you for your own good.\\"<br /><br />With Lord of the Flies, the problem is \\"We can't trust that *everyone* will have basic human goodness.\\"<br /><br />With Battle Royale, the problem is, \\"Blind loyalty to government leads to a government that doesn't feel responsible.\\"<br /><br />With Jennifer Government, the problem is, \\"Reducing regulation on corporations and government size eventually results in corporations ruling as if they were the government.\\"<br /><br />With Hunger games it's vauge and hazy at best, the best summary being that \\"Having a centralized government is bad except when you have tiered centralized governments, in which case only the top one is bad, and if you get rid of the top one somehow the 'more local' centralized government will somehow be okay and somehow always has been and will be free of corruption, even if it is a centralized government in and of itself\\" ... yea. Kinda screwed up. Basically, the author is trying to make a huge story-line based case in this book about how \\"Federal government is evil* (insert spooky 'oooooo\\" here) but somehow regional governments are completely fine and good, without ever addressing the fact that they're effectively the same thing with just a difference of scale, and withoutreally pointing out any differences between the two.<br /><br />There's no valuable message here. Not vital lesson for making our world a better place, no things you have to really watch out for, no useful cautionary tale...<br /><br />It's just ... \\"ooooo, federal government is scary.... ooooo.... feel scared!\\".<br />Frankly, after encountering this piece of tripe, I'm more worried about this book and the fear-mongering it will cause than the federal government.<br /><br />Also, one thing that REALLY, REALLY, irked me about this book... especially since its supposed to be based on our world.... corporations and big business just somehow magically disappeared. We have these huge bloated behemoth of organizations in our world before the events of the book, and in Hunger games.. they just... aren't.<br /><br />There's no mention anywhere. No mention what happened to the corporations, no mention of who the big players sided with in the war (capitol or regions). There's not a single mention of who bribed who, where those corporations that exist outside of North America are doing today (or really, most other governments at all for the most part)... it's as if somehow some of the biggest players in socio-economics... in a story about socio-economics... just somehow... aren't. In a story and setting to where the positives and negatives of such organizations SHOULD have made a HUGE impact on the development of the story, and had an impact on the world getting to its present state..... nothing. Not even a whisper. Not even a nod of the head saying \\"yea, they're still doing their thing\\" or \\"government declared immenient domain on them\\"... not.. just... poof... gone. Never happened.  Even Battle Royale, which in almost identical to this book in many regards (except that it was written in Japan about China, Battle Royale came first, at least makes mention of this stuff, saying that the government closed its borders to all such things. Here.... it tries to pretend that such things never existed and somehow don't apply to the situation at hand.<br /><br />These aspects change what was obviously meant to be a dystopian cautionary tale into just a piece of smelly steaming propaganda. And like all other piles of steaming s***, deserves to be scooped up and flushed down the toilet.
B00HRJVHEK|5|I feel like my life changed after I watched this film, it will forever be my absolute favorite. The director is absolutely marvelous, his other films are magic as well
B00000IPAX|4|When I listened to this album for the 1st time . I knew Blink 182 reached a new high . Plus it was the 1st album with Travis Barker who is so much better than Blink's former drummer . I recommend this album to all Blink , punk and music fans.
B00B5HQKNI|5|One of the best Bond films!  Saying goodbye to Judy as Q was sad but a needed boost as well as the new Q.  Always the great chase scenes!  Some continuity issues throughout the film made it fun to see more than one time.  Thanks for bringing back the more traditional Bond beginning : )

B00009TB5G|5|Okay, if there's one thing I am sick of, it is die-hard Tolkien fanboys trashing this series of movies. Yes, the movies are not like the books-I will gladly concede this point although they only Tolkien book I have read is 'The Hobbit.' And, given what I read there, if you were to make a movie exactly like Tolkien's books, NO ONE BESIDES YOU WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO WATCH IT. Yes, he's clever, and erudite, and somehow manages to seamlessly blend both mythology and the picaresque tradition, but not every word on the printed page can, or should, be written and shot. And when you're dealing with a world of so many supporting characters, tangential characters, background, folklore, and history, something's got to give. <br />Adapting anything into a film is a very difficult business-much harder, I think, than starting with an original idea. Yes, there are lots of good things to take from the orignal work-and lots that should never see one frame of finished film. So, the filmmaker looks at where the story truly lies-what the drama is. Where the conflict as at its sharpest. In some cases, that's easy to find. In some cases, it's not there, and you have to invent it yourself. I'm continually astounded by the length of the Rings films-not only how big they are, but how much story is there, and that the majority of it is actually WORTH being there. For the non-purists, these films are a treat-all told, you're getting over six quality movies' worth from three films. For the purists, your answer is simple-go buy the rights to do your own remakes, write your own scripts (without deleting one scene or character, in fact, just copy the text from the books straight into the screenplay), get some studio to finance it all, and produce your own trilogy-otherwise, we don't care to hear it any more. Most of the rest of us are happy with the ones Peter Jackson is doing.
0060775858|5|My children's all time favorite night time book!
B00I29VGMC|5|Absolutely, hands-down one of the best books I have ever read! Archer is an amazing individual brought to life by the talented Mia Sheridan. I fell so hard for him, and his innocence was a refreshing breath of air in a time where the majority of the books now seem to focus on the alpha male. I cannot stress how much this book affected me, the extent in which I fell totally in love with it surprised me. So sweet! &#60;3 Fan for life.

0316282243|5|So great! Its everything I had hoped for, as an avid brony/pony collector, I love this, it looks straight out of the show and even shares a quote spoken in the show, which I found rather cool. It's not quite as long as I had had thought, which I'd say could be the only relal drawbck, and a small one at that, overall, awesome, would recommend to any fellow brony/pony collector out there.

B0002NRRAG|5|I browsed amazon earlier today, and came across Madeleine Peyroux. I checked out some of her stuff, and found her beautiful version of Between the bars. <br />Just now, I read the review by the person who heard her music at Barnes&Noble and ended up trying to find out who it was for ages, and I had a sudden revelation. <br />While I was in the US 2 months ago, I also spent some time reading in a Barnes and Noble store in Georgetown, DC, and there was this beautiful jazz music playing. The song was very familiar - Elliott Smith, I just couldn't figure out which one - and the voice too (Billie Holiday?) Afterwards I checked if Mr Smith had done any jazz covers, but to no avail. And now I found it! Small world. Madeleine Peyroux, my new love.. Thanks amazon, thanks B&N, and that person in Florida who had this same revelation... Funny thing.
1594200696|5|First off, I want to say that the cover portrayed currently, a blue cover, isn't what I got when I ordered it. I got a cloth red cover like the picture added by a customer. The cloth red cover is a bit rough to the touch and isn't the best, but as soon as you open it and see the gorgeous, glossy, full color illustrations paired with the text we know and love from previous editions, you will be thrilled to have this book.<br /><br />I opened my parcel in front of a guest and she immediately wanted to feel it and read it. The illustrations add a lot of charm.<br /><br />If you have read this book before and want a copy to keep, or are giving this book as a gift to a writer or reader, this would be the edition I'd choose. It is well worth the extra money and is a wonderful edtion to any library.<br /><br />The old Strunk and White I read because I felt I should, this edition I read because it is a pleasure.

B003924NY0|5|Johnny Winter's lone entry in the hugely successful \\"Original Album Classics\\" Series is a genuine nugget. A 5CD Mini Box Set concentrating on his rightly celebrated Late Sixties/Early Seventies Blues-Rock output - it's also mid-price into the bargain.<br /><br />Released 24 January 2011 in the UK (1 Feb 2011 in the USA) - each CD is housed in a singular card sleeve which repro's in miniature the back and front artwork of the original vinyl LP (with recording info, production credits etc downloadable via the Net from Sony's website). Columbia/Sony Legacy 886976561727 breaks down as follows:<br /><br />Disc 1 is \\"Johnny Winter\\" released May 1969 on Columbia CS 9826 in the USA and June 1969 on CBS S 63619 in the UK (34:14 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 2 is \\"Second Winter\\" released as a 3-sided 2LP set in November 1969 on Columbia K2S 9947 in the USA and May 1970 in the UK on CBS S 66321 (46:57 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 3 is \\"Live/Johnny Winter And\\" released March 1971 in the USA on Columbia CS PC 30475 and in the UK on CBS S 64289 (40:12 minutes)<br /><br />Disc 4 is \\"Still Alive And Well\\" released April 1973 on Columbia KC 32188 in the USA and in the UK on CBS S 65484 (44:32 minutes)<br />[Note: Tracks 11 and 12 \\"Lucille\\" and \\"From A Buick Six\\" are bonus tracks]<br /><br />Disc 5 is \\"Saints & Sinners\\" released February 1974 in the USA on Columbia KC 32715 in the USA and in the UK on CBS S 65842 (41:48 minutes)<br />[Note: Track 11 \\"Dirty\\" is a bonus track]<br /><br />Winter's debut LP \\"The Progressive Blues Experiment\\" was released on Imperial Records in the States in April 1969 - so the first disc on here \\"Johnny Winter\\" is actually his 2nd album and his debut for Columbia Records. Along with its impossibly cool follow-up \\"Second Winter\\" (a 3-sided 2LP set where Side 4 was blank) - they are vinyl treasures I've had on my turntables for over 40 years.<br /><br />Highlights from both include the twin guitar boogie of \\"I'm Yours And I'm Hers\\" along with the stunning National Steel slide of \\"Dallas\\". And as if to stamp his credentials on the genre, the cover of the Muddy Waters staple \\"Mean Mistreater\\" features two huge Blues Legends - Willie Dixon on Bass and Walter \\"Shakey\\" Horton on Blues Harp. Speaking of mean harmonica warblers - Winter's own Harp playing on \\"Back Door Friend\\" makes him sound like some 70-year old veteran. The immediately impressive \\"I Love Everybody\\" track from \\"Second Winter\\" turned up on those CBS sampler LPs in 1970 and 1971 while his cover of Percy Mayfield's \\"Memory Pain\\" sounded so hard rock - a great opening salvo and a clever reading of the changing sounds of the time.<br /><br />But like Rory Gallagher on \\"Live In Europe\\" (another genuine guitar hero), it wasn't until 1971 that you heard the full power of Winter and his band on the now legendary \\"Live\\" album. There are versions of the Stones' \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" and Chuck Berry's \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" that are arguably definitive - blistering stuff. I'm afraid I threw many a guitar shape to these tracks in my living room as a teenager...oh dear...<br /><br />The final two albums featured here - \\"Still Alive And Well\\" and \\"Saints And Sinners\\" - saw RICK DERRINGER both join the ranks and produce. The Canned Heat/ZZ Top boogie of \\"Rock & Roll\\" (lyrics above) and the Slide Blues of \\"Too Much Seconal\\" showed that the magic was still there (even if the drugs seemed to be getting the better of him). His version of the Stones \\"Silver Train\\" from 1973's \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" sounds so much like them that it might very well have been an outtake from that Stones session with Winter singing lead vocal instead of Mick Jagger. His funky spoken intro of \\"I'm hungry...Let's do this f****er...\\" to \\"Still Alive And Well\\" raises a laugh to this day and his raucous version of Chuck Berry's \\"Thirty Days\\" is great fun too. And on it goes...<br /><br />To sum up - nearly 6 albums worth of great Blues-Rock for roughly two quid a record is a bit of a no-brainer really.<br /><br />No Winter of discontent here folks. Recommended.<br /><br />PS: and if you want more check out his late Seventies collaborations with MUDDY WATERS on Blue Sky Records which feature Winter producing and playing on all (see the 3CD \\"Original Album Classics\\" box set).

1595827684|5|Great concept art book for fans of the series.
B00LZWV8JO|4|In summary, gripping and suspenseful.<br /><br />Comparisons.  I think Seveneves is best compared to Tom Clancy's work, had he written science fiction (at least, the first two acts, more on that later).  If you enjoyed &#34;The Martian&#34;, you should also enjoy this book.  Other than that, I can't think of a good comparison for you.  It's unlike much of the other science fiction I have read in terms of sheer detail, pacing, and scope.<br /><br />Review.  The Moon has broken up and all life on Earth will end.  Seveneves Acts 1 & 2 details humankind's last ditch effort to save the species by launching it into space.  I leave Act 3 for the reader to avoid spoilers (but this will come up below, so be advised).  Stephenson incorporates a very high level of detail concerning near future technology and the problems inherent in a worldwide panicked rush to space.  He quite practically breaks down the various problems of inhabiting near-Earth space (from water, to oxygen, to fuel, to food, to orbital mechanics, and even politics in space).  It's quite the space opera as well, as Stephenson introduces a wide range of characters, each playing roles of varying levels of import.  Overall, the work is quite dark, as humanity's plans for salvation fail, one after another.  Things break, people die, hope fades page by page.<br /><br />Specific Critiques (Spoilers!):  Act 3, oh my, Act 3.  Stephenson's appeal is rooted in his meticulous research and attention to detail.  When something goes wrong in Seveneves, he explains to you the science of why it went wrong.  When something won't work, Stephenson has done the research to thoroughly explain the physics behind the problem and the solutions our heroes come up with.  Act 3 is set 5000 years after the events of Acts 1 & 2, and, as such, Act 3 is entirely science fiction.  It is completely different from Acts 1 & 2.  Frankly, Act 3 should probably have been a separate book, a sequel.  Additionally, some of the world building in Act3 makes no sense.  Humankind went from the telegraph to iphones in 100 years but our future space society can't reproduce our computer technology after 5000 years of additional technic civilization?  Also, the topic of genetic diversity comes up quite a bit in Act 1 and early in Act 2.  For those of us keeping track late in Act 2, we knew the species was screwed worse than the cheetah due to insufficient genetic diversity. Moira's solution to this genetic bottleneck smacked of deus ex machina.  Finally, there are a number of loose ends left to tie up that Stephenson (I assume) intentionally left for sequels.  What was &#34;the Agent&#34;? What happened to the Mars expedition?  But for Act 3, these oversights would have been acceptable, however one would think after 5000 years, humanity (and the reader!) would have the answers to these questions.<br /><br />Final Thoughts.  But for Act 3, five stars!  If you enjoy &#34;heavy&#34; sci-fi, you will enjoy this book!  Settle in though, at 881 pages, this is not a quick read.  Also, it's more &#34;Battlestar Galactica&#34; reboot than it is &#34;Star Trek&#34;.  Very dark, people can't be trusted to do the right thing, and you will be feeling left hopeless at times.  Hardly uplifting, but definitely fascinating.
B005UKK4Y2|4|It was clever and had a full character arc! there were dynamic characters and lots of jokes. Took a bit of time tor the movie to rly kick off but once it did it was hard to stop watching
0385535139|1|I had read a previous review of The Litigators and the reviewer used the phrase \\"his best yet\\".  It is not.  I have read every Grisham novel and I found this one derivative of his others, slow-moving, and poorly written.  The characters lacked orginality and were almost flat, except for the little old lady in the bar.  I wonder why she was not developed further.  Although perhaps she was because I stopped reading about half-way through and skimmed another bunch of pages.  Sorry to be so harsh, John, but are you by any chance writing by \\"committee\\" these days?
0399226907|5|thanks!
B000FC13Y0|5|More for adults than the movie. I absolutely love this book, I've read it twice!
0375842381|5|The Golden Compass is by far the best of the three, we're introduced to young Lyra, we get to see her world and how it differs from ours. The story is very intelligently written and expressed in very vivid detail. The storyline is grand and suspenseful, and (especially if you saw the movie first) the ending is quite a bit different than expected. the characters are vividly drawn, and rich in detail and resonance. I did see the movie first which inspired me to start reading the series, but the more I read the books I find the cast was expertly cast. Sam Elliot was perfect for the role of Lee Scorsby and Dakota Blue Richards' portrayal of Lyra was spot-on. but this is a review of the book not the movie. I found this one hard to put down,and if read as a fantasy epic adventure it works flawlessly. On the subject of religion, which is where most of the criticism comes from, there are times I agree with the portrayal, and other times I found myself wondering what was the purpose behind how it was portrayed. But, there are a few points in the overall story that didn't seem to pan out for me. But, again, overall it's a great series and an excellent addition to my book collection. I loved the relationships between the characters and the way the author had of showing each character's true nature. It all centers around Lyra, and it seems by their reactions to her, they tend to be defined. Much like your enjoyment of this series is how well you relate to or understand the central heroine. Fortunately she's not one dimensional like so many other child characters in books these days. She has many facets and many personal changes throughout the course of the series. I keep seeing this series compared to Lord of the Rings or the Chronicles of Narnia, while I can see that to some degree, this series stands on its own. Like Lord of the Rings Pullman gives rich full details on the characters and the enviroment. You find yourself immersed in this little universe as if it were your very own. Sometimes he tends to give us too much detail, but that's fine. It never takes away from the overall story or mood. But whereas The Chronicles of Narnia was replete with Christian imagery and allegory, this one is the opposite. I am not sure if it's anti-church or anti-God (as it's been accused of being) but rather a distancing from all the things that interfere with the lives and journeys of the individual. You get the feeling he is saying that heaven is within us, good or bad is within us, you don't need to look for internal sources to govern your lives look inside of yoursel. Religion has been known to get in the way of clear thinking. There are occasions when the chuch seems to stray from it's intent and message, and there are times when people spend too much time preparing for or thinking about the afterlife that very little thought is given to the life we have now, and if there is an overall theme to the series it might be that, the greatest journeys are the ones we take within ourselves. That this life, this time we are in now, is the most precious. But, regardless of the religious or anti-religous overtones and underpinnings this is a great story with great characters and surprising events. This is a great way to start the series.<br /><br />The Subtle Knife is my second favorite, and introducds Will to the story arch. While I like Will and find his character well though out, it bothers me that Lyra, who up until now was braver and stronger and more clever than any adult she knew male or female, was suddenly helpless (at times) and needed to be saved/rescued or helped by the male character. The reason this bothers me is there are so few strong female characters out there, and even less who are created by men, who are totally self-sufficient and strong. Why would Lyra all of a sudden play second stringer to a boy when her own actions and plans worked so well for her in the past? It just makes me feel as if they are saying that it's better if the man makes the decisions and protects the girl. It's a little too old fashioned for me. But, the saving grace is the relationship that develops between the two, as Lyra is getting older her thoughts are changing along with her body, she's becoming aware of herself as a woman, albeit a young woman, and that is juxtapositioned against this backdrop of saving the universe, or the multiverse and herself as well. I find the relationship between them to be real, they only know each other a short while, but their experiences together, and the fact that they are about the same age, helps them to bond, and children of that age are more trusting, but at the same time selective about their friends, but when they do find a friend, they tend to be loyal and caring. this opens up a whole new world for Lyra, while she's always had help, now she has an equal. the side story of Mary Malone though never quite does anything for me, and while it seems like there is a buildup, it never actually delivers. But overall a great book, and a page turner.<br /><br />The Amber Spyglass is my least favorite, but that isn't to say it's bad, or unreadable, but just like the Last Battle in the Narnia Series, it leaves you feeling a little unsettled as if some of the pieces aren't actually fitting together as nicely as they should. While the story is grand in scope and still strongly sculpting the character and the story arch. There are times, you are left wondering: What was the point in that? The whole war with the Autority and the demise of the God-like Creature seems a little anti-climactic. A lot of people might lose interest here simply because of what it seems to be implying about God and religion. But, I feel that if you are strong in your faith and truly believe in what you believe then no fictional story, no matter what the intent was behind the metaphors, should be threatening to you. It simply should be read as an epic fantasy story, and not be taken so seriously. Like I stated though I found myself asking, what was that all about more? than actually getting offended or discusted by the metaphorical references. full disclosure, I am a firm believer in God but not a fan of organized religion but I do not criticize anyone who finds solace in the chuch. But at this point in the story, you already know there is a bit of an anti-authority vibe flowing through the story, and it's simply part of the mood/plot. I did wonder what it was Mary was supposed to do or say that was to be the temptation that Lyra was supposed to either give into or spurn. They were portraying her as the new EVE, and that Mary was the serpent in the garden but I never quite figured out what it was that she was supposed to do. And again it seemed like the plot was building up to something at the end of the story but it just seemed to go on for a long time without actually going anywhere (much like the Last Battle) But the tale of self-sacrifice and parting of friends and lovers more than makes up for the misfires I would like to see what happens to Lyra when she gets older and wouldn't mind seeing a reunion of sorts with all the characters. The bond between Lyra and Iorek is a pretty interesting one, and I feel that it wouldn't lessen due to time. So that would be interesting to see. I didn't like the fact that Lyra lost the ability to use the alethiometer after she had finished her mission, it was something that made her special, and it's like sad to see her lose the ability and now she has to relearn it, I guess it shows character development as it shows that originally she was a smart girl but wasn't very keen on learning, yet she was wise in other ways. But now she is shown the importance of learning and the benefits and rewards of studying. Overall I'm very happy to have found this series, and look forward to the chance to read more. So hopefully that will happen sometime soon.cisions and protects the girl. It's a little too old fashioned for me.

0767834739|1|This is the sequel to 2002 first Resident Evil, which is based on the popular video game series. The movie starts right where the first one left off and you don't have to worry about them messing up any of the plot points because there is no plot to either movie. Instead of plot, you have Jovovich and a few other people running around shooting, stabbing, punching, exploding and basically killing every kind of zombie that happens to cross their path. It is nothing but non-stop action and explosions the perfect thing to watch if you are trying to fall asleep. The zombies spread their plague by biting their victims which makes you wonder why Jovovich and the other women in the movie run around in shorts and tank tops. You could ask, but remember there is no plot so just let it go. Unlike King Arthur, where I was told no one wants to watch a movie with ugly people in it, Resident Evil is filled with ugly people. Really ugly people. It tanked at the box office so therefore, the ugly people rule must be right. The ending leaves the movie wide open for a third installment and I know everyone will be holding their breath until number three hits the big screen.
B00JBN7TUQ|1|Three things I do not like. First, I do not like that this game changes my Amazon GameCircle preferences each time I open it.  I have turned Amazon GameCircle off and do not want it turned on without my knowledge or permission. But each time I open this game to play (with or without being connected to the Internet (i.e. in airplane mode), Amazon GameCircle is switched back on allowing for background monitoring of my actions. Secondly is the size of the cubes and there is no way to zoom in and out of the game to get a better look at the images. Thirdly, many of the images are cropped images of other images. With millions of cats in the world, you would think that the creators of this game could be more creative on the use of images in this game.

B0000E1WKE|5|Let the haters hate on but the fact remains, Whitney can sing, and she did nothing but justice to all the traditional Christmas Carols. She has a gift of delivering songs and with that gift she just blesses us and this album is yet another one of those blessings. Aretha is old, yet she's still blessing us with her voice. I sure do hope that Whitney will also sing for decades to come. Bobbi Kristina Brown is superb on &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot;. Cissy, Whitney and now the world is eargerly waiting for Bobbi Kristina. Buy this album, it will be worth your while.
B00JH3S0AI|3|This is one Wierd tripping Sci Fi movie that I never would've bothered to watch if it didn't star Scarlett Johannsen. The opening minute is just a black screen and then a speck of light in the center of the screen! I thought my TV went out. There's hardly any dialogue and a lot of Wierd instrumental music in the background. Lots of male frontal nudity and a quick glimpse of Scarlett but don't blink, you'll miss it! She is supposedly an alien but that's never explained and she kills many men by entrancing them with her beauty and its done in a Wierd way. This is one of those movies like 2001 A Space Oddyssey that may put u to sleep and may be better watched on drugs or plastered! Super low budget.

As to be expected, the colours are more vibrant, picture is sharper and sound is wonderful. The extras are a little disappointing as there isn't much more than on the DVD but that aside, I am one Happy Customer...
B00QW8TYWO|3|It is nice
B002ZG981E|2|Maybe it was better in the theatre but I thought Inception wasnt any better or worse than any other mind binder type of movie
B004TI5N38|5|John Puller does it again.  Great read.
B00563M11M|5|A moral story centered around a cynical \\"copper\\"? ... & again a story with direct comment on the world we live in.<br />Again an entertaining story that gives enjoyment & that still make you stop & think \\"wait a moment that's exactly like ...\\"<br />AND a whole new appreciation of poo ;^)<br />Thank you again Terry.
B0012GMUIG|5|Was recently thinking after ordering the Legacy Edition of Piano Man, wouldn't it be nice to get a More Songs in the Attic? Live versions of Billy's less popular tunes like Vienna, James, All for Lenya, Until the Night, a few more tunes from Cold Spring Harbor, maybe a few from The Bridge and Glass Houses. Even some River of Dreams would be great. Just a thought.
B00AF6MF9I|5|I thought this was a excellent strategy war game. The online addition to the game was good also. In this game you can rank up and increase your glory rating. The glory rating system in the game allows you to enter contests and at the end of every week you get medals. The campaign in the game is slow. The reason for that is because you need to have oil drums to do them. When you get online you can have factions. Factions are groups of people joined together, like a clan almost. However there is also a system in the game that you can add other people in the online world as your friends. The friend system allows you to send out a distress call for help in battle in you are losing. In order to gain hearts you need to go to there base every 24 hours and put out fires. This game comes complete with air, ground, and underwater modes. Overall this is an excellent game to buy and I think you should. Good luck out there.
B002DD67XG|5|If you like James Taylor you will like the album.It is a great addition to my music collection
B000BFH2S2|5|Michael Buble has so much energy and he comes across as a very nice guy.  He flirts with the audience, engages them, and talks to them.  This DVD is very entertaining.  Michael's voice is magnificent.  He's easy on the eyes, too.  The band also did a fantastic job!!
B000066NW0|3|What a shame that in America our culture so readily embraces an artist such as Avril Lavigne.  Nothing at all against her personally.  She probably is a perfectly wonderful human being!  But for such an overproduced, commercialized album with such a scripted feeling and -should I dare say- contrived sound to be so popular is a little troubling.  I do stress that I don't have anything against anyone who worked on or contributed to this album.<br />    For what it is, this cd was well done in that it was put together by talented craftsmen (with large budgets).  It is troubling though, that as far along as we as are, we (children and adults alike) listen to music like this and we refer to this person as an artist based on this product.  Imagine if other art forms were commercialized like music.  Just think -- \\"Here' a nice painting by Joe Artist.\\"  More like, \\"Here's a nice painting by Joe Artist's Label.\\"<br />    **  Two stars because there is a lot of worse stuff out there that has to have only one star with this rating system.<br />    *  One extra star because she seems to have another dimension, although it is very hard to detect on this cd, and for the fact that Avril probably would have been very good if she had not have been gotten a hold of so early, before she could even begin to develop into a great musician, [It is the responsibility of the people to not contribute with their dollars to whatever the big companies are marketing to you. There is truy just to much great music being recorded out there, and it's readily available.  Look around on Amazon, you could spend a fortune every day on truly great music.]<br />    Avril Lavigne's voice is fine the same way that Justin Timberlake of Nsync's voice is fine.  You would probably be able to enjoy it very much in a musical setting that was not totally devoid of any sort of meaningful emotional content.<br />    Oh well, we'll see.  I truly hope and almost expect that America will start to put more stock into what music should be about: An artist communicating his or her thoughts and emotions though the beautiful medium, thereby giving human beings a small emotional window to peer into the human condition.<br />    Just my -thoughtful but humble- opinion
B008RA3X5E|5|I hate alarm clocks, I mean common! Who doesn't? But this one if super cool!!!! If you have music on your kindle Fire, you can have your alarm set to your favourite songs! You can also change the design of the clock. It it totally worth the &cent;99/coins. This would be my second day using it and I am already telling friends about it. It is perfect!!!<br />(\_/)<br />( &deg;&middot;&deg;)<br />(u u)*
B0042UEU8M|3|The movie emphasized the rescue element as opposed to the terrible emotional quandry the protagonist (played by Zac Efron) was going through. There was also a down-playing of the supernatural, so important to the slow reveal of his hovering between two worlds due to a near-death experience. All that to say, it ain't so bad but the book is so much better (and so short it's practically a novella)--read it, preferably first.<br /><br />Finally, if you Zac groupies were expecting to see a newly buffed up hunk as portrayed in the ads and trailers, almost none of those scenes made the movie's final cut.
B00D97HPQI|5|This book is easy to read and has a very interesting and contemporary point of view.  It also pointed out a couple of interesting books that I added to my wish list.  I cannot vouch for its overall accuracy but I do know that this is crucial information that should be presented to high school seniors and college freshmen.
1451695195|5|An enlightening, beautiful story that everyone needs to read!  What an amazing opportunity to be able to share this experience with others.  Couldn't put it down and had to reread sections to get the full affect!
B00F91RYL8|3|Exactly as expected.
B0011Z78R6|5|I've always loved the songs on this album.  Glad to have it in MP-3 format.  Keep those emails coming.  Thanks
B00ATDOVNK|5|Just started playing, enjoying game play, object collecting and mini games not to difficult. Enjoy looking for objects to work or open other items. I love G5 games all of their games I have enjoyed playing.  Great graphics. Well going back to continue playing the game, not got to the part when I have to pay.  I'm sure I will continue playing.
B009MCRHH6|5|Fun game and will keep u busy for hours on end very challenging and well worth the money and the time spent on playing it!
B004BJMEO6|5|EXCELENT MOVIE AND VERY WELL DONE ..ACTORS AWESOME TOGEATHER  AND DIRECTOR DID GREAT JOB..LOVED THE ENDING AND ALL THE MOVIES I HAVE GOTTEN FROM U R JUST GREAT SO THANK U FOR A GREAT SELECTIONS..
B000002UCQ|5|This has to be one of my favorite Beatle solo albums. It's an incredible piece of work with tons of great songs... I just love this album, and find something new each time I listen to it (which is a lot, by the way). George  seems to be able to communicate so many things through his music, and I  find that it touches me emotionally more than anyone else's. All of  George's work speaks to your heart through beautiful melodies and lyrics. I  recommend this album to anyone interested in George's work... :)
B00BL1BF56|1|The DVD cannot be played at all. Waste of money.
B009CPJHY4|5|Loved it, great story lines!
B0085YOZFE|3|Despite the title, I found zero orbiting in this game. It's more like a variation of Bust-a-Move or Snood where you aim shots into the play area, except then they inflate into bubbles. Each bubble has a number and that's many hits it requires to burst. Exploding bubbles damage nearby ones for possible combos. If your shot ricochets b back too far, game over. That's the whole experience. You even have to wait between shots while the animations finish, so it's kind of slow overall. I prefer games where more time was spent on the actual gameplay than the colored particle effects.
B00000273P|5|I was very pleased to be able to locate this CD, which had strayed from my original collection. Finding a used copy in good condition at Amazon let me replace my lost CD inexpensively, quickly, and conveniently. The seller represented the item's condition accurately and delivered it safely & promptly. I am very happy.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|I loved this book. The separate story lines gradually intertwined and the characters continued to develop until the very end. The inner dialogs were so well written and relatable. Just a really engaging book and so many &#34;I can relate&#34; moments. Intricate relationships and well developed scenarios and conversations made this an excellent read.
B000FA57US|4|Quick, timely arrival.  New or like new packaging, item in great condition.  Pleasure to do business with seller.  No problems at all, just as I expected.  We've seen all of the Halloween movies and my daughter wanted the collection.  Recommend to anyone who enjoys watching and/or collecting the original Halloween movies.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|John Grisham's Sycamore Row entertains his readers with the cohesive story that includes, law, love, greed, murder and justice. From the first chapter, we are able to immerse ourselves in the legal process at its' very best. No need for a major stage... just a small town with a history and a heart. An enjoyable and rewarding read. Thank you Mr.Grisham!
1451678193|5|I read this book as a young boy. I remember how much I loved it. So I look forward to rereading again.
B00499NHLC|5|Sherlock is the most entertaining show on TV.  It's a great current treatment of the old stories.  Very well done with great actors.
B000BNX4MC|5|Everyone knows this movie.  At least that is what I thought until I realized that my fourteen year old son had not seen it.  So, we watched it together and, of course, it has the same issues of conformity, rules following, boredom, freedom, life, learning, and stupid power trips for him as it does for everyone.  A terrific movie that you should watch with any of your teenagers who haven't seen it.<br /><br />What brought it up was the insurance commercial with the guy playing as the Risk that Never Sleeps and I pointed out to my son, \\"Hey, that's the guy from the parking garage in \\"Ferris Bueller\\".  \\"What?\\" he answered.  So, it was a must see.<br /><br />He loved the point about Cameron (indelibly played by Alan Ruck) being so tight that a lump of coal placed strategically in his anatomy could turn coal to diamond in a week.  Rooney being made the fool constantly is always enjoyable (perfectly played by Jeffrey Jones) and we enjoy seeing him get stuck in the mud, embarrassed, attacked by a dog, kicked in the face, and confronted with his wallet.  Edie McClurg as Grace is the PERFECT foil for Ed Rooney.  Who doesn't love her pulling pencil after pencil out of her teased up hair or the way she says \\"righteous dude\\".<br /><br />Of course, Ferris could be a monster if not played with just the right charm and lighthearted mischievousness that Matthew Broderick brings to the role.  If Ferris didn't actually care about other people and was only a sociopath it would be an awful story.  It really only works because Ferris is fooling parents who should have been paying closer attention, a sister who shouldn't be so uptight, a friend who is so miserable at home that trashing a rare Ferrari is the lesser crime, a principal who is vicious as well as stupid, and a headwaiter who is arrogant without any warrant to be so.  If all of these were caring and supportive people and Ferris was using them this way, well, he would be the bad guy.<br /><br />In any case, the movie is full of classic scenes, such as Ben Stein's calling roll and his little lecture on economics, the growth of the Save Ferris movement, Jennifer Grey's perfect performance as the steamed and jealous sister, and the performances mentioned above.  Mia Sara's performance as Sloane Peterson provides the one grounded and sane character in the whole movie.<br /><br />The extras on the disk I viewed were great (I assume there are various editions).  I learned lots of things about the making of the movie.  One of the interesting bits is that Cindy Pickett and Lyman Ward (the parents, Katie and Tom Bueller) became a couple because of these roles and are actually married.  Also, Ben Stein had a feature talking about life and how Ferris shows us about freedom and how Ferris Bueller changed his life.  One of the funny bits is when Ben explains how Richard Nixon is the reason he got the role in Ferris Bueller and is responsible for all the good things that have happened to him because of that role.  I always enjoy Ben Stein talking about anything.<br /><br />An excellent and fun movie that I think benefits everyone who sees it.in's calling roll and his little lecture on economics, the growth of the Save Ferris movement, Jennifer Grey's perfect performance as the steamed and jealous sister, and the performances mentioned above.

B002KSPKRS|5|My husband loves this product he even purchased one for my nephew. It makes it so he can hear more background noise in his games and does better. Overall it just makes him happy. :)
B004JK61K0|3|Good functionality overall. It doesn't have its own address book, has to use Google's which in my book takes it down to 3 stars.
B00CDT41RY|3|I'll give this my long haul airline trip recommendation, it will burn and hour and half painlessly.  For sure not worth spending full price at the theater, but entertaining.<br /><br />What was lacking was a compelling plot, conflict, the story just chugged along.  A short visit from Boyd Crowder, (Justified), I begin to wonder if he really is this character.<br /><br />Bottom line, step up your game movie guys, with HBO, Showtime, and other fine network shows with good writing and character development, movies today seem like just a single episode.  TV used to unilaterally suck and movies were special, not so today.
630027179X|4|The Arthurian legend (see, it's a \\"legend\\", synonymous with \\"myth\\", as opposed to \\"history\\"), which exists in different versions, is an amalgam of several myths dating from various periods, and this film is just bringing them together into a whole that's fancifully fictional, majestically mythical, and dreamily dazzling.  So what if we're seeing intercourse in full armor, over-the-top combat scenes, and weaponry that wasn't copied from a museum exhibit?  Really, who cares?  In fact, I think the film's refusal to  \\"truthfully recreate\\" period props, from armor to outfits to architecture, is rather a plus. Lancelot's shiny aluminum suit is quite fetching, and Morgana's breast plates put Madonna's old Gaultier bra to shame. The movie has some fine actors, not a few funny lines, and breathtaking scenery, but what I love most is the film's gloomily mythical, indeed wagnerian, atmosphere, which is largely thanks to its soundtrack. The Wagner score works perfectly (the Excalibur theme from Goetterdaemmerung, heavy with foreboding, is an especially brilliant touch). In fact, you might start listening to Wagner after seeing this. (I did.)
B00DJFIMW6|1|The game tells me that I need to download an update, but the app store tells me that the update has been downloaded. Now I can't play the game.
B0000DJZ7W|5|I understand very little French but I absolutely love this album. The \\"hokiness\\" that is sometimes present in her English songs (or, that is, songs written by American lyricists) isn't a concern with this album. The guitar acoustics are wonderful and sometimes paired with catchy vocals and lyrics (\\"Tout l'or des Hommes\\"). \\"Retiens-Moi\\" is upbeat acoustic. Just listen to the samples on Amazon. I've always been a fan of her vocal abilities, but admittedly not of some of her American songs (e.g. \\"Because You Loved Me\\"), even ones that have hit the top 10. Just check out Babelfish (translate function) through Altavista. I love the album. Check out her other French albums - for the musically open-minded, they are generally not a disappointment. Enjoy!
B00HXYKYIE|3|I loved the book until the ending.  It unfortunately ruined it for me.
1568363931|4|I bought this book mainly for inspiration. I'm a beginner at bento lunches and cooking in general and will realistically, probably never make most of these recipes. However, the pictures are beautiful and this is a good cookbook to add to my collection.
B0007PAMR4|5|This was a entertaining movie. I have suggested it to all of my friends. It is a great and fantastic movie.
B00CYFGCOW|1|Quit working after very few times of gentle use , disappointed but hasbro is replacing free and very nice about it!
B00BEIYL6G|4|While watching this movie, I found myself being a little critical about this and that, you know--all kinds of things, mostly details. Then I realized: I'm not pressing \\"pause\\" OR \\"stop\\"! That says something good about this film. I'm sure there are lots of things that aren't accurate, and they can be annoying or distracting. But this is a movie, not a documentary. The alternative to its having some \\"inaccuracies\\" is to not have this movie at all, as it's impossible to make a 100% true-to-fact biopic. As for me, I am glad this movie was made, and I think it's smart and well-conceived.<br /><br />The above statement aside, I am a detail person. I notice things like right/left handedness and the changes in style of jeans, including Levi's. But if you get hung up on these kinds of things, you will not be able to enjoy this very good film.<br /><br />There is a lot of criticism about the film from people who know more about Jobs than I do. Like not having anything in it about Pixar. I watched/listened to the directors commentary and learned that this film was intended to be about Apple. Perhaps it should have been titled \\"Apple,\\" unless maybe that name was taken by some other movie.<br /><br />You have to come to terms with the knowledge that this movie was made from a point of view. It's not intended to be a film version of an encyclopedia article.<br /><br />That said, I saw somewhere that Steve Wozniak has had some criticisms about the accuracy of the movie, especially the roles of and conversations between himself and Jobs. Now, those comments might be worth a listen.<br /><br />I rented this movie from one of those tardis-like red kiosks. After watching it, I wanted to watch the commentary, but it was NOT THERE, as you have to actually purchase the disk to get that. And sucker that I am (glad to be one, this time), I bought the disc set from Amazon. (Tip: I got the Blu-Ray version, and the commentary did not work from the menu. I found it, though, by changing the audio track, using the remote).<br /><br />The director's commentary offers lots of interesting insight. I'm glad I purchased the movie, just for it. It was a little annoying that the director says \\"sort of\\" and \\"kind of\\" over and over, in a similar way to how people used to say \\"like\\" (He says that a lot too!). I noticed that same exact thing of another commentator for a totally different movie (if you want to know, it was \\"All is Lost\\"), and wonder what the deal is. Despite the \\"sorta/kinda\\" annoyance, both of these commentaries are extremely well done and very interesting.<br /><br />I like how the scenes from the seventies were not overdone, for instance the glasses, big hair, and home decor of the day. There was just enough of all of that to suggest the time but not to distract from the story line. And that Ashton Kutcher lost and gained weight in order to more accurately play the different ages and sizes of Jobs! This actor's performance mimics the real Steve Jobs in so many ways. For instance, he totally nailed the walk.<br /><br />And that the house used in the film, the one with the famous garage, is the actual house where Steve Jobs grew up! How cool is that?<br /><br />Anyway, great film, I think. If you want exact historical accuracy, though, you won't find it anywhere! For something close, though, watch a documentary (I think there are already one or two available), or even check out Wikipedia (but don't get me started on that)...
B007SGM084|5|I started this book and then put it down.  When I found out a little Greek Lady was reading it, I picked it back up.  It is an amazing series, keeps you glued to the plot.  Don't quit early, it is truly a romance series.
B002MQYOFW|5|This book is on the edge of your seat. Couldn't put the book down even for a second just had to finish the chapter to see what happened next.
6305171769|5|Well this one I couldn't keep away from. The first time that I rented it I couldn't believe my eyes. I just loved it and couldn't just watch it once it had to be more than that. Will you make a Halloween 7 or 8 if you do I  believe it will be just has good. Nice action and was Kind of funny too.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Every fun and addicting I just got it and already am already addicted I would highly recommend it. Love love love it
B0001L3MI0|5|Independence Day is not just a movie. It's more than that. It is an action movie of epic proportions, filled with explosive action, and good characters. The film centers around the President of the United States (Bill Pullman), a nerdy scientist (Jeff Goldblum) and an all-American fighter pilot (Will Smith) and how those three characters react to the alien invasion of the world. Many people just dismiss this movie as 'sci-fi'. While parts of that is true, it's a bit closer to Armageddon than Star Wars. I have always loved this movie and still do. Now, where's Independence Day 2?
B000MRA5NS|1|I'm no stranger to product placement, nor am I against it, but when I saw this movie, I couldn't help but feel the experience was cheapened by all the close-ups on Sony products.  When the camera purposely zooms in to show Blu-ray on a disc, PSP on the back of a videogame system, or Cybershot on a camera, it gets a little annoying.  It's no surprise that Sony placed all those products, it is a Sony Pictures film, but the purposely placed shots of Sony products was too much for me to handle.  There wouldn't have been an issue if there were a Pepsi sign in the background, or if a character used a Cybershot camera; but when a shot zooms in to show the brand, model, or format, I call commercial.  If this is what all James Bond movies are going to be like, I might as well just stay home and watch TV.  I don't pay to go to a theater to be bereted by a two-hour long Sony commmercial, and I won't pay to do it again.
B00A6CCF0K|3|I'm not an avid reader of King or otherwise. Although I am an avid horror fan, often times questioning why? Sadly the novel Dr.Sleep which I just had to read, doesn't' provide any clarity.I'm sorry to say it left me less than impressed. Sequels by nature, tend to be a disappointment, but I had so hoped for an exception. Thirty years later, I think Dr. Sleep should have just been put to sleep, and the classic left to continue to Shine! I'm not saying it's a bad read, but obviously had a tough reputation to follow between both the original novel and the film. Even taking the latter out of the equation, it just doesn't' live up. It comes off as would, a made for TV movie. Any scary element surpassed by the weird, meaningless, or Harry potter nature of .
B003162R7E|5|It's really Jimi and of course it's great! I wanted to add it to my collection. I didn't expect anything really new and it wasn't anything really new, but it was Jimi playing with the people that he really cooked the best with.
B00CWY76CC|5|was very interesting game and like nothing I have ever played I hope new levels come soon very fun some difficult but can figure out
B004DLPXAO|5|Great
B00OH74BXY|3|If you are a fan of X-Men you won't be disappointed.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I read this by recommendation and I was not disappointed. Chapter 21 got he emotional but it was deep. One of the best stories in my opinion. I am starting \\"paper towns\\" next! :)
B00I8Q77Y0|4|it is an ok game, a little slow and glitchy but ok. it is of no compare to flappy bird but compensates for the loss. it angers me though that people would go to horrible extents to make a person feel suicidal because their game is too hard, I mean, life is more meaningful than that! obviously, those people need Jesus and a brain.
B003B02O0A|5|This book is amazing. I have seen the film version probably a dozen times, and the book blows it out of the water. Much more suspense, legal drama, and character development. Loved it!
B00FKF0F3C|4|Tour de force! At times too many details, by and large compelling! Well composed, very good story teller.
B0000029DD|5|I always wondered who sang 'Hallelulah' on the original Shrek.  Now, I know.  His voice is haunting and the entire album a tribute to his talent.  So sorry to hear of his premature death by drowning.  Nice to know this album has kept his voice from being silent.  Well worth the money.  Peaceful, haunting, and mesmerizing.
B007J4T2G8|1|So sorry I bought this!  First couple of chapters were okay, then got into some kinky stuff!  Definitely NOT the book for me or anyone I know!
B00P9TTSK0|2|Great idea, the game was great until it became impossible to advance without paying real money just to keep from not dying all the time. You can't upgrade weapons without gold. And that you have to buy.
B005GY0Y8S|4|I really enjoyed reading this book.  In fact, I could barely put it down and read it rather quickly.  It held my interest and I never guessed who the killer was.  A good read.
B008JFUO72|4|Very satisfied
B00NNYISC2|3|I came away with an entirely new view of Marilyn Monroe !  She was a remarkable woman who overcame so much.  But since the true story of her death is not known I have to wonder if her persona was a complete facade and that she fooled us all.  She may have gone down to the wire in complete despair.
B00EQ0CKRQ|3|I would say this game had good graphics but it was hard to hit controls. Other than that its great you get tons of points for each race!!!!
B00ESGYQWA|4|Cool, Hip, Contemporary. Totally believable cast of LA movers and shakers. Would that they will do more.
B00632HWOG|3|Clearly this is the easiest way to check on my Email, I'm very pleased with it!
B00CLD65X0|5|CONSTANT drama:  Actors are EXCELLENT.  Well worth the time to view. One gets involved with the drama in every episode.
B001LRJH0U|5|I viewed \\"Appaloosa\\" at my wife's library. It is a superb gritty realistic western, that is full of excitement and thrilling action. The cast is excellent and so is the story. The price Amazon was offering this for was too good to turn down. I recommend it to any Western movie collectors. With TV getting worse every year it is good to have a good movie you can watch now and then.
B000Q9IZ5C|5|I admit I was a latecomer to the Firefly and Serenity movement, but it does not dim my love for all things in that 'verse now. I also admit to a fine hankerin' for all things Nathan Fillion, and this here will do me jus fine. Any excuse to see the movie again is perfect with me, but seriously, the extras on the second disc made this a \\"must have\\" for my collection. If you, as I, feel that 13 episodes were simply not enough and you yearn for more information than those simple few can give you, than this is the perfect addition. The \\"never before seen footage\\" was a thrill; I truly enjoyed every overblown, choreographed, gaffed, giggled, serious and heartstrung moment. Also, a cute little flyer came in the box with mine for \\"Ships Papers\\", \\"Alliance Money\\" and a few other collector items for sale, for those who are truly dedicated to keeping the Firefly mystique alive. The box itself is quite a bit more hardy, and beautiful in a way, and its outer raised embossing is pleasing to the touch. I am very pleased to have this version in my personal collection as well as the original, but if I had to choose just one, I'd go for this one.
0061537934|5|This book has it all... I loved it, every minute of it.  Definitely worth reading.. it's a great one!
030746363X|5|LOVE This book and all of Tim Ferris' work. Whether it be the Four Hour Work Week or Four Hour Chef or This book Four Hour Body, I can guarantee that I will be going on an adventure and come out feeling like I can accomplish anything that I want to. And, it gives me great insights into things I didn't even realize I wanted to accomplish, but have been inspired to accomplish because of Tim Ferris' approach to life! I absolutely love the choice of simplicity or diving into the science and studies behind anything he writes about. Thank you Tim! You are a rockstar!!
B00GPWEPZ8|4|This movie is fantastic, the perfect combination of fun, snarkiness, and poignance. I laughed and cried and wanted to tell my friends about it.
B000B589JI|4|are very well
B00GINENG0|5|Best game of the year
B005RJ6AIK|4|Just saw the movie tonight, I was surprized to hear one after another through the entire movie great soothing instrumental music. Having being an admirer of slack key music for a great sometime and only recently began learning to play, this form of music is easy on the ears.... The backdrop of Hawaii was great. Movie - line -- so so.... I would recomend this movie just to hear the music........
B000YMBBH0|5|Sweetness! HD DVD may have lost the war, but hey, at least now you can get HD DVD for less than regular DVD's. While supplies last, that is.
B008RXYOKY|5|I also needed a firewire 400 to firewire 800 cable from Radio Shack to do a direct transfer.  My aunt finally upgraded and needed to transfer information from her 10-year old computer to her new computer.  She is loving her new iMac but was really worried that she couldn't move her old information from one computer to the other.  This adapter made the final connection and now she is loving her new computer with no interruption in her data.
B00KG2NGPS|2|The story was slow and my husband and I really tried to hang in there with this movie. The Monuments Men dragged on, and on and it lost us a few times. We continued to watch to the end. I wouldn't watch it again, no matter how much I love military movies.This one need a little more action in it. The Actors though it was great seeing them again, just had no get up and go. My opinion only of course. If you want to watch it then, go ahead but have a lot of beer and popcorn on hand as you will need it for excitement .

B002EDH0FE|1|Trite comic book movie with shallow characters and a predictable storyline.  If you've seen any other super hero movie, you've seen this one.  The We Didn't Start the Fire of the comic book world.
6305077630|3|Well ,  it's true : the subject , the title , everything AROUND the movie seem to tell you : &quot;If your 12 or older , don't even think about watching it&quot;. But you would miss something : Weird science is a crazy  movie : Of course , it's  highly unbelievable (2 teenagers create a dream  woman with their computer), but you can't help loving it because ,  exactly  like &quot;Ferris Bueller Day's Off' directed by Jonh Hugues too ,  it  makes you laugh and shows the best moment in life : when you're a teenager  and life's just a game...
B008YZ4RR0|5|I know I'm prejudiced and just plain like Tom Selleck, but I really think that Selleck has hit a certain stride with these Jesse Stone movies.  I've liked every one of them, and some of them are very memorable and worth re-watching.  To me, one of the most important things about a movie series like this is creating and maintaining a certain atmosphere, and these films definitely have a characteristic and distinctive atmosphere.  Part of it is accomplished by the cinematography and by the consistent feel of the New England setting.  Part of it is by the consistent set of supporting characters, all played nicely by good actors.  But much of it is simply created by Selleck himself.<br /><br />Sometimes I think that Jesse Stone is what Thomas Magnum might have been like -- grown up and sobered by having had life smack him in the face.  A bit cynical, but  only because he is a sensitive soul who has been wounded.  And in spite of being jaded, still holding on to something he knows how to do -- finding out the truth and trying to do the right thing.
B004GUSG4M|4|This was an exciting novel from the beginning and ended with an unusual twist.  Christine was a likable character and her circumstances were quit believable.

6303148352|5|On the small remote island of Isla Nublar, seventy-five miles off the west coast of Costa Rica, man brought nature's most extraordinary creatures back from the past using a special technique of recovering and cloning dinosaur DNA.     Now dinosaurs extinct for sixty-five million years roam  &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, an amusement park on the island created by  Scottish professor John Hammond (Richard Attenborough, Lord of England) and  his genetic engineering company, InGen (International Genetic Technologies,  Inc.).  But when something goes wrong, and security systems fail all over  the park, including the fences that keep the animals in their paddocks,  paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobontonist Ellie Sattler (Laura  Dern), mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum, star of this film's  sequel) and more make a desperate attempt to escape the island gone  haywire... in one piece.  With appearances by Bob Peck as raptor expert  Robert Muldoon, B.D. Wong as Jurassic Park genetic scientist Henry Wu,  Samuel L. Jackson as control room computer operator John Arnold,  Martin Ferrero as John Hammond's lawyer, Donald Gennaro, Wayne  Knight as the fat slob Dennis Nedry, and Joseph  Mazzello and Ariana Richards as the young brother and sister Tim (othy) and  Lex (Alexis) Murphy (last name is only mentioned in the novel).  A  marvelous full-length adventure vividly entertaining and suspenseful from  maybe the most successful director, Steven Spielberg (&quot;Jaws&quot;,  &quot;E.T.&quot;) and author Michael Crichton (writer of &quot;Congo&quot;  and many more successful novels).  A must-see movie!
B000000WA4|4|I bought this CD without listening it first. It was Christmas, and I felt alone. I felt even worst after I completely heard it. I LOVE THIS CD.  Billy, you're the one who knows. I still find something different each  time. A MUST.
B0095XPZBC|1|I've watched one episode on my 10ft projection screen and I felt like I've been had.  I would like to return this to amazon, but it's open ... all they can do is send me another equally inferior HD restoration.  A little annoying HD restoration on a 55\\" TV screen is unbearably annoying on a 10ft wide screen. I really don't want to watch the rest of the episodes ... so maybe I can beg amazon for a refund.<br /><br />Paramount should of waited a year between each season and do the restoration correctly.  Probably some restoration outfit that made the lowest bid, promised to do the restoration at warp speeds ... not because they were good at it with many years of experience with a lot of their reputation riding on the results ... nooooo... it was because they knew how to game the system, meet the contratual requirements (which were probably poorly written), and get paid and not suffer from poor feedback ... because they are laughing all the way to the bank!  I'll blame Paramount for writing poor quality requirements and not managing and demanding better quality before release.  I'll not buy another season until they correct the remaster for Season 2.<br /><br />Anyone have a direct email for paramount STTNG restoration team?  I feel like unloading my mind on them for such poor quality.  This is Star Trek, not some Gomer Pyle episode.<br /><br />Edit:  I lowered my rating from 2 to 1 after I saw the toy star ship with blue blooming engines in the Q episode with the borg.  Just a lazy effort with no consequences.  Too bad.<br /><br />Edit:  Dear Cody:  Since you watched Season 2, I'll respond.  The equipment I used (studio monitor and projector) to base my comments upon is all based on LUT image<br />processors.  It's what hollywood post production facilities use for the director to watch Blu Ray content prior to release to the public.  The dark shadow areas in Season 2 are<br />plagued with dark color compression artifacts (noise).  This is a symptom of poor quality source material (what you ended up after the remaster).  Season 1 did not have this.<br />Also, image detail was notably sacrificed as seen with the Star Ship Enterprise looking \\"toy\\" like, also a symptom of a poor quality master.  The point is that the people who did<br />Season's 2 remaster saw this, and still released it, knowing it was greatly inferior to Season 1.  It's professionally unacceptable and they need strong feedback from people who<br />have the ability to do so, as many others have done, to correct their behavior.
B005PW3OS8|5|This film that depicted the origin of Captain America was great because it did not stray too far from the comics.  Seeing the scrawny Steve Rogers attempt (and continuously reattempt) to enlist in the US army during WWII for no other reason besides devotion to the flag and ideals that made the United States what it is showed the classic \\"Cap\\" mindset that comic books fans have always seen in this hero.  Chris Evans played a believable Captain America throughout the film.  Hugo Weaving played a great Red Skull - a traditional Captain America nemesis.  The brilliant yet unhinged persona shined through in his portrayal.  This was a purely fun, entertaining movie - not one designed to make the viewer think deeply.
B007IXWKUK|4|This book is in reality not really good. But it is very addicting! I am about to purchase the last part now! Lol
B000M4RG42|4|Count this film as one that practically demands that a viewer also read the book, which fully deserves its five-star rating. Director Eastwood gives the right balance of coverage of the lead-up to the battle, the battle itself, the dual flag-raising, and the promotional tour to sell war bonds. The movie can't seem to make up its mind whether the immensely successful tour, with its elevation of non-heroes to heroes, was good or not. Obviously the impact on America on a grand scale and the three survivors was profound.  <br /> <br />\\"Doc\\" Bradley is the central character of the movie, with Ryan Phillippe's performance fine and somewhat understated. Adam Beach is the true star, with his moving portrait of Ira Hayes. This human drama is part of what makes the full story so compelling: the diversity of the flag raisers (the book covers the widely varying backgrounds of all six) and the drama that followed. <br /> <br />The movie is shot in very muted tones and colors for the Iwo scenes, matching the drab, seemingly endless grays of the volcanic sands, and the grim battle action. The first wave invites comparison with \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", and while on a smaller scale, the action is riveting. The focus on the embedded Japanese hidden from view is exactly right. The 30 days of battle after the flag raising are mostly ignored, as they had to be, other than occasional comments about the real heroes who continued to die.  <br /> <br />I'm ambivalent about the time shifting. It would never have worked in the book. Here it works ok, breaking up what probably would have gotten repetitive, as the tour moved from one stop to another. <br /> <br />For a war movie, this film can be watched (as I did) on a small screen. Don't hesitate to watch this DVD on your TV. Too bad there wasn't any supplemental material, and it's sad to think that both Joe Rosenthal and the man who took a movie of the flag raising are now gone. The movie, indirectly mentioned by showing it being shot next toJoe Rosenthal, helped prove that the photo wasn't staged. The accusations of staging come up a few times in the movie and are never addressed or explained, as we the viewers know what happened.
B00002N9ER|5|I needed a few of these to mount a Maglite in the garage and in my truck. Perfect solution. Made for Maglites, may not fit other flashlights. Better quality than the thin metal clamp-types that are out there. Will work vertically or horizontally if your light fits. Also, tight fit--if you don't attach it securely, it will pull out of whatever you attached it to.
0671034065|3|I was more than half way through the book when things finally started to happen. Though the banter back and forth between the two main characters was entertaining from start to finish, I felt as if I kept waiting for the excitement to start. Once it did, it came in a florish. I was also disappointed that Ms Howard did not spend a little more time developing the villian. I felt like she forgot to tell the reader about him throughout the story, and put it at the end as an after thought. An ok read...not her best.

0425173755|5|Ah, yes. The world famous case of the \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" (MotOE). It is so famous, even people who have never read Christie know who did it. I first read it 12 years ago even though someone had already revealed to me the identity of the murderer. I've never forgiven him. But I read it anyway to find out for myself how Agatha Christie constructed the story in order to fool her readers.<br />Christie was probably inspired by the true story of the 'Lindbergh baby' kidnapping. Charles Lindbergh (he who flew across the Atlantic alone) had an infant child who was kidnapped and murdered even after the ransom had been paid. <br />The background to MotOE is also similar to the Lindbergh case. The victim is revealed to have been involved in a kidnap-murder case a few years back and got away with it. Was he punished for his crimes at last? Was he murdered for something totally unrelated? Or was he a victim of mistaken identity? <br />The usual suspects remind one of the typical English drawing room murder mysteries: an English colonel, a Russian princess, a count, a beautiful mysterious woman...they are all here. And Hercule Poirot has to discover who the murderer is and why, all by using his \\"little grey cells, mon ami.\\" <br />The revelation in the final pages will surprise the reader yet it will not strain belief too much. MotOE has been accused of being incredulous and downright silly but I disagree. Those who feel that way probably forgot that they are reading a fiction novel. I am sure one will find it a lot of fun if only to find out who from among the varied cast did it. You'll be gobsmacked, I assure you :)<br />The solution will also show the reader why MotOE is famous in its uniqueness and has never been copied (no writer dares to).<br />Another Agatha Christie mystery that features an incredible revelation and giving an \\"I would never have guessed that\\" feeling to the reader is \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\". Both the Ackroyd and the Orient Express booksshould be in the Murder Mysteries Hall of Fame, if there is one.

B000001ZS3|5|So begins Jean Michel Jarre's long circular path that, at the time of this writing, will end with Aero.  This path has been illuminated with motifs running from clocks and time-stasis, to seasons and revolutions, from deep space to deep oceans, to advances in stereo and 5.1 surround technologies.<br /><br />And what better place to begin than with the motif that is most required for human life, the one-third essence of water, and a tiny fraction of our atmosphere: oxygen.  Jarre's first solo album is an aural presentation of burning stars, atmosphere formation, light refraction and the colors thereof, density of air, life, and finally proof of life: wind.  To feel the wind blowing on one's face...an image represented by the intro and outro to Oxygene 6.<br /><br />Jarre has said that the surprising success of Oxygene was due to its dissociation with similar electronic works released in the 70s.  Rather than focus on short loops and patterns, he expanded his ideas (somewhat deviantly) from the classical form, resulting in a technique that ebbs and flows, morphs and variates.  Ever true to the electronic limits of his time, Jarre cannot simply remove all blips and beeps, but embodies these textures with the grace of a divinely-inspired man (he has said so himself!).<br /><br />Oxygene presents these incorporated motifs of colliding atoms and fleeting particles over smooth, glass-like melodic themes.  The effect is profound: like drifting.<br /><br />And while Jarre has never been happy with current technologies, feeling limited by stereo in that the listener can never be fully immersed into his soundscapes, his audience can hardly complain.  His music has allowed us to delve into worlds we've only dreamed of, unrealized until now.

B00000K0E5|4|After a six-year absence it was with breathless excitement that I sat there in a darkened movie theater at the Mall of America in Minnesota waiting for that familiar gunbarrel sequence focusing on one of my favorite television and movie actors.<br />What followed was a great couple of hours with the best femme fatale in a 007 movie since 1983s Fatima  Blush. Famke Janssen was so much fun as Xenia that she dominated the screen in every scene in which she appeared.<br />Brosnan throws himself into the role with vigor. With something definitely to prove after being denied the role eight years earlier he gives a rousing and thoroughly entertaining performance as the British secret agent. Brosnan never looked better and it's only a shame that he failed to live up to his initial promise with his subsequent movies.<br />Judi Dench gives the series, and all the tired old-boy M-scenes of previous movies, a shot in the arm with a fresh take on the part of Bond's boss. The dialogue was crisp and crackling and although the novelty has since worn off back in 1995 it was a welcome change.<br />One of my favorite young British actors Sean Bean (of the Sharpe series and `Stormy Monday') appeared as the main villain. It was great to finally get a good, involving fight back in the 007 movies as the two agents threw themselves around the lofty inclines of a radio transmitter.<br />Which brings me to - secret villains base. It's not quite a hollowed out volcano, but hiding the transmitter under a lake was a nice touch. The actual location has since appeared in a number of movies and television shows but at the time of GOLDENEYE's release it was exciting to see a return to the world of secret villains super-lairs.<br />One element I really liked was the score from Eric Serra. It was fresh, different and toe tapping good. Serra thankfully used the James Bond Theme sparingly (unlike some idiots I could mention) and I really enjoyed it.<br />Overall a good, solid James Bond movie that allowed the viewer to have a fun, entertaing ride along with the actors.<br />This DVD was released with a nice selection of bonus features that includes an engagingly amiable and entertaining audio commentary between Michael Wilson and Director Martin Campbell. They discuss all facets of production and the reaction the world had to the new james Bond Pierce Brosnan.<br />Apart from the usual special features there is also a loose look behind the scenes with footage of the crew at work.<br />Other special features include:<br />-A newly created widescreen master for optimal picture and sound quality<br />-The World of 007 Documentary with Elizabeth Hurley.<br />-\\"GoldenEye\\" music video by Tina Turner<br />-Behind-The-Scenes Featurette<br />-Collectible \\"Making-Of\\" Booklet<br />-Original Theatrical Trailers and Television Spotsun, entertaing ride along with the actors.

0765356147|5|On its own merits, I would rate \\"The Hero of Ages\\" a solid 4 to 4 1/2 stars.  The characterizations that are Sanderson's strong suit in this series continue to impress.  There are a few minor missteps along the way, or perhaps more items that I find distracting.  Once again, he focuses a great deal on the internal monologues (sometimes dialogues) of his characters' minds.  This is actually a pretty necessary part of the book, but he does tread the same ground over and over again.  As I mentioned in my previous reviews, he never does it in a way that's too annoying, but I did sometimes think to myself, \\"Yeah yeah, I got it already...\\"  That said, I think that he had to tread a fine line there and he pulled it off. If he'd spent less time on the internal workings of characters' minds, the reader may have not been as primed for a few of the revelations that occur, and the revelations are well worth the time spent.    The back of the book refers to an 'audacious' ending, and I've seen similar comments made.  I'm not sure I would go that far, but it _was_ satisfying.  Too often, writers don't seem to know how to end their books in a way that satisfies the story and the reader.  This is one of the very few series that hasn't disappointed.    I will point out that if you like every single thing neatly wrapped up and explained, no loose ends, you probably will be a bit upset.  There are at least a couple of things that appear as though they'll be important and then they just kind of disappear without later reference.  And there's one mystery that remains so when the book ends, but it's not really fundamental to the story itself so I was able to accept that the answer just wasn't going to be given (it sounds likely that the world of Mistborn will be revisited in the future, so this puzzle may yet be explained).    Once again, Sanderson weaves a parallel narrative (brief italicized paragraphs at the start of each chapter) which ties into the main story.  I mentioned in \\"The Well of Ascension\\" that that book made the revelation in \\"The Final Empire\\" even better.  Well, \\"The Hero of Ages\\" makes the first two books even better still and forces you to reassess your opinion of the villains and heroes in the previous stories.    I haven't gone too much into the plot here, because I think the unraveling of the overall story and the puzzles within should be as unspoiled as possible, it really is done exceptionally well.
B000SVZIR6|5|I rented this AGAIN to compare with a stage musical I had just seen to see how true it was to this movie.  I like the ending of this movie better than the musical...King dies.  I am a romantic and wanted all to click at the end!

Boy, when she said new content, she meant it. This book was five times as long as I expected it to be, and full of her funny and poignant blog entries as well as new adventures and misadventures to share with us. I laughed, I sympathized, I even shed a tear or two. It is definitely worth spending the money to buy this book.

1400032717|5|\\"This will not be a funny book.  I cannot tell jokes because I do not understand them,\\" says Christopher Boone, who is writing a mystery novel while investigating the death of his neighbor's dog, Wellington.  Modern day Sherlock Holmes?  Not exactly. Christopher John Francis Boone is an autistic teenager who just happens to know every prime number up to 7,057, all the countries of the world and their capitols; he cannot stand to be touched, and detests the color yellow. He lives in the suburbs of London with his father, and likes to walk up and down his street in the middle of the night because it makes him feel like he is the only person in the world.  But this isn't just a regular mystery novel, for Christopher also learns about life, love, and the importance of family.  English author Mark Haddon tells the tale of a boy who loses his way, finds it again and solves the mystery of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.     Seven minutes after midnight Christopher finds Wellington lying in the middle of his neighbor's, Mrs. Shears', lawn with a garden fork sticking through his middle.  Mrs. Shears accuses Christopher of killing the dog and since he knows he didn't, he begins his own investigation.  However, his father says that he's not allowed to ask Mrs. Shears about who killed her dog, or ask anyone else about who killed Wellington. Christopher's father also demands that Christopher not trespass in other people's gardens, and eventually, \\"to stop this ridiculous, bloody detective game.\\"     A couple of days later, Christopher explains to Mrs. Alexander, the old lady from house number 39, that he thinks that Mr. Shears killed Wellington because he doesn't live with Mrs. Shears anymore.  Besides, Christopher's father always says that Mr. Shears is an evil man. Christopher's father and Mrs. Shears have grown quite close ever since Christopher's mother passed away and Mr. Shears left Mrs. Shears.  Mrs. Shears has helped Mr. Boone around the house, andbeen his constant companion through their difficult times.  When Christopher asks if Mr. Shears killed his mother, Mrs. Alexander lets out a huge secret that Christopher's father has kept from him for two whole years.     Since Christopher has a mental handicap, everyone doubts that he is capable of taking the math A-level in school.  What everyone doesn't know is that Christopher is a mathematical genius. He can do complicated equations as easy as I can tie my shoes.  Throughout the book Christopher's math equations and formulas are followed by pictures and descriptions relating them to his life.  Christopher has proven his mathematical abilities to his teacher, Siobhan, and she arranges for him to take his math A-levels a few weeks after Wellington is killed.  However, Christopher loses concentration on taking the test because of all the major distractions he's facing like Wellington's death and his issues with his father.     Christopher inquires about his life, his dead mother, and other mysteries of adolescence while investigating Wellington's unfortunate fate, make The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time a great book for all readers, young and old.  This book receives an A-plus for me because it's relatable, and even though Christopher and I have almost nothing in common I find myself sympathizing with his situation.  You will love this book enough to read it multiple times because every time you read it you'll find something new, whether it be a new quirk of Christopher's, an eccentric new picture, or a new piece to the puzzle of who killed Wellington.  Get inside Christopher's head to solve the mystery of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.

B00J6YA1V4|2|Prince Lestat has aged...and not very well. This work is like an old home week for the blood drinkers...a who's who of the vampires in Rice's earlier works. I read many of her books some years back, and thoroughly enjoyed the profound dark sensuality and violence of the characters and the locations. This work however reads more like a yearbook of the community, from the true ancients to the &#34;fledglings&#34;, and it's not exactly gripping. It was news to me that Lestat's mom was one of the crew, and then, to mix it up a bit, Rice introduces two young mortals, a young woman Lestat protects, and a son he didn't know he had. The primary source of conflict is The Voice, who locates himself in the heads of various vampires, giving them orders to destroy others. Why? Because he's lonely? Nope, this is not one of Anne Rice's best efforts, if indeed it was an effort.
B000RW3YYA|5|love the series, wanted to own it for continuous watching got our grand-kids hooked now and love to watch with them!
B005K0HDGE|3|I kinda was looking for a different ending...maybe it was just me.  Not your ordinary King book.  Gripping, nonetheless...but different.
B008578PRK|5|Suspenseful and scary!
0894803123|5|This book is excellent!   This book helped me turn the corner in my ice cream making.    Simple recipes that produce outstanding results.    If you look closely at the recipes, you can break them down into components to mix and match your own flavors.   This is the only Homemade Ice Cream Recipe book you'll ever need.
B00CWY76CC|4|Makes you think. Thanks
B00CLD65X0|5|This show is a fabulous float through time. A window into life at a very dynamic period in history. And oh the drama...
B002QYUVY8|5|I love this movie so much! It is really funny, well written, very quirky and has one of the coolest after effects intros ever.
B00F031WB8|5|One of the best documentarys that i have EVER saw!!
B0064MPXFA|4|Great show.
B000QCTNIW|5|The information in this book was fascinating and amazing.  It was very well written and I loved every minute of reading. I am looking forward to reading Dr. Doidge's newest book, The Brain That Heals Itself.
B009LDCZ7I|5|THE MOST AMAZING SERIE I HAVE EVER SEEN<br /><br />I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS SERIE TO EVERYBODY, IT IS SO UNEXPECTED THAT YOU CANNOT GET YOUR ATTENTION OUT OF IT
B00992CF6W|4|I really love this app but it needs some fixing. It makes no since that xbox 360 edition has so much more. And they have the nether mechanisms and lava. But the only thing that the PE edition has that they don't is Creative mode... Bogus
B00FOWX6NM|4|THe color is more brown than the metalic gold shown in the photo. The rubber has darkened quite a bit from placing it into pockets of dark jeans.  the back is nice and showcases the champagne back of the iphone.
B00IIOFVYA|2|I would have given it a four if it would stop freezing up, or not even loading.  I find this game common at best and more childish than interesting or scary.  And I am really insulted they had the nerve to charge $4.99 to unlock such a disappointing game, shame on you.  Up until now I have been very happy with all the G5 games for the most part, now you are raising the price and lowering the product.  Too bad, greed is a terrible thing.  Once you cheapen your product no one will buy.  Just sign me disappointed.
B0094M2ITG|5|Great movie to inspire imagination.
B0087240Z4|2|I was disappointed with Zeitgeist, not really a bad album, it simply lacked the should that previous albums had.  I'll just ignore the free offerings of teargarden by kaleidoscope simply because everyone else did, but this contribution Oceania is just a continuation of soulless blaa. This all sadly reminds me of the later Cure material, were band members come and go and the megalomaniac at the head of the band pushes foreword in an effort to produce sequel after sequel of a popular album while watering down the magic it once contained.  So, I'm done buying Billy's albums, at least until we actually see the smashing pumpkins reform, obviously there is a lot more to a band than the singer.
B0000027RL|5|I bought this cd a few years ago and I think that it is the best cd ever! Alive, Even Flow, Jeremy, and Black are my favorites and the other tracks are great to. I would recommend this cd to any rock fan.
B00AAQWMB4|5|Initially seemed like a simple concept, but the game is hard to master. Games go for 5-10 minutes, but I find myself completely focused while playing them.<br />You'll like it once you buy it. Read instructions, though. You can flip and rotate shapes. I didn't realize that initially.
B004ZNARH4|5|Any fan of the Floyd loves this, DAH!
B00P596I8Y|4|Very interesting horror metaphor for internalized fears/desires. Well done!
0767919416|5|an excellent book -  shows how nothing much changes in worship of heroes -- and surprise 'social media' was absent in 1927 yet thousands showed up all over the globe to cheer
B00899F0G8|5|i am in love with this show It is the best show ever. I watch it everyday. It is my favorite! I am so glad I found it because I have been needing to catch up and I couldn't find it anywhere!
0307744434|5|Such a phenomenal book! I was captivated and in love from start to finish!
B006VRZ5YM|3|Pretty good Rom Com.  Occasional chuckle.
0765316994|2|When I heard about this book, I was excited. However, after reading it, I feel like the ball was dropped. The plot resolved way too quickly and the final conclusion was not all that original. Felt like satire against sci-fi tv shows, not an original sci-fi adventure.
B000069HKH|5|Almost a year post 9/11, I needed this music.  The Rising, in Bruce's poetic voice, helps me to process the horror, shock, and utter sense of loss I feel in our &quot;never-will-be the same&quot; world.<BR>I love the way he merges different voices(the departed heroes, the loved ones left behind, and even the suicide bombers.) As I listen, I cry once again, but these are tears that bring a catharsis.  Thanks,Bruce for the tone of hope, recovery, and rising above. This the essence of the American spirit: we can be at our best in the worst of situations.
B007PT3QOQ|4|the only bad thing is waiting to get more energy. everything else is fun though. farming and hunting is cool
B00DR0PDNE|4|Setup was a bit more challenging than I expected.  Initially I plugged the device in behind my TV and it couldn't find it.  I then plugged it into a side port and after 4-5 attempts it did connect and I was able to stream a TV show.  Tip if you have been watching on lower res on a laptop it will look BAD on a 42&#34; TV.<br /><br />The Good:<br />I tested it with a non-standard streaming site and it worked brilliantly.<br />Sound quality is as good as your TV or sound system (no tinny echos from my laptop and no lag with between the audio and video.)<br />The video quality is completely dependent on your source 320p looks awful, 720 looks broadcast quality,<br />Hulu works fine<br /><br />The Bad:<br />The power plug is rectangular and doesn't fit into european round receptacles.<br />Plugging it into the side of the TV isn't attractive.<br /><br />The Meh:<br />When you first turn it on you have to wait approx 1 min for it to be &#34;Ready to cast&#34;  until it syncs you must wait.<br /><br />The Ugly:<br />The power indicator light makes a VERY bright night light (it didn't wake me up but I did make me unplug it to get to sleep).<br />Casting a normal webpage works but the text is miniscule.  Using your browser's zoom helps but isn't perfect.  150% was good for me.<br />AmazonPrime uses a video type that isn't currently supported.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book is so great! I love it so much I am reading it a second time! I would recommend it to anybody who likes a sad but good and enjoyable book.
B000002AGN|5|\\"Time Out\\" by The Dave Brubeck Quartet will always be one of the best instrumental jazz albums of all time. The arrangements are exceptional and I am mesmerized by the way these fine artists make every track a work of art. The music is further enhanced by what Amazon refers to as \\"the use of irregular meters in composition;\\" forget common time--this creative angle works. To be specific, there is the unmistakable influence of Balkan dance music in the time signatures for this album! In addition, the quality of the sound is excellent. After wearing out the grooves on the vinyl LP I picked up years ago, this remastered CD is a joy to listen to.<br /><br />There's not a bad track in the lot here and the result is that I don't really have a favorite number--the more I listened the more I came to love hearing it all! However, I will make one suggestion for newcomers to this style of music: listen especially for that sophisticated \\"Take Five\\" which you may already recognize (and the only number on this album not composed by Dave Brubeck but by Paul Desmond), the amazing \\"Blue Rondo &agrave; la Turk,\\" and the elegant \\"Pick Up Sticks.\\" It just may leave you wanting more!<br /><br />With Dave Brubeck on piano; Paul Desmond on saxophone; Joe Morello on drums, and Eugene Wright on bass you can't go wrong! This is instrumental classic jazz by some of the best musicians ever; and I highly recommend their music.  True, we may have lost Dave Brubeck today; but he lives on through his unforgettable artistry.
B000000H5J|4|This good.  I like alot.  Thanks
B00BD99JMW|3|While still a great story, just seemed like there was a ton of &#34;wordiness&#34; and too many plot twists.<br />Sometimes hard to keep all the characters straight.  But we have to find out what happens, don't we!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This game is very addictive..... but it is very angering....... I<br />Don't let it fool you. This game is surprisingly difficult but good. It is also exactly like flappy bird

B00ECU2RGY|2|I normally enjoy Tom Cruise's movies a little. This movie for me moved my mind into a capsule of fantasy that was kind of like a bland dry saltine cracker. It starts off with a essence calming sterile fantasy...with its simplistic tone driving the romanticism. Watching it was like skipping pages in a book to blank ones then back to half a page then to a whole one...very choppy and cheap to me in a mild way. I kept on waiting for Jodie Foster to show up (Elysium)....ha ha. Anywho....I also wish they would have chosen another actress for Tom Cruise's lost wife (Olga Kurylenko). The actress they chose for the role...her heavy accent and whispery volume/voice made me want to stop watching. If the movie overall had been a stronger one with more action...then the light and airy presence Olga brought wouldn't have been so annoying. I appreciate the attempt for this movie made for something more blank canvas artistically, but it just didn't intrigue me enough to CARE.
B00JP5GRVM|5|Wonderful film.
B00005YW4H|5|After seeing her on a tribute to Elvis Presley I immediately went to Amazon.com to listen to some samples of her music.  I settled on the CD titled Come Away With Me ... which I just love.  Her voice is so comforting to listen to and I play it just about every day.  Now that I have one of her CD's I intend to purchase more.
B00A2H9OSK|5|I am a fan of Vin Diesel..<br />Doesnt matter much what movie he is in as long as there is action<br />Both my husband and I are fans<br />Would recommend this movie as a &#34;guy flick&#34; for the action, &#34;chick flick&#34; for looking at all the great looking male actors in it
0375851569|5|Who doesn't love Dr. Seuss?! Got these for my daughter who is 7 months old.  My wife and I read them to her and she loves the colors.  Although she would love to grab the pages, rip them out and eat them, but she is only 7 months... This is a pretty good value too.  You are basically getting 5 books for under $6.  The same books at Walmart are around $8.
B005KJJ4F8|5|Loved this book! I loved how it was retelling Cinderella but in a different type of way.  I would definitely recommend this book! 😊
B00011D1OA|5|Got this as a gift for my hubby. He loved it. Great picture and sound. Package was well protected. Love it.
B00A2BTCM4|5|This remaster is awesome... love it...although I have the remaster from a few years back and unless you have a really great cd player you prob wont see the diff. I got this more for the 5.1 version which is great
0345803485|1|What I saw in this book was the stolen innocence of a very young girl , Pedophelia . The girl does cart wheels for cripes sake . And the man is married who is raping a young child. This book is about desensitizing adults over the raping of children. Has anybody who has read this book , drawn that same conclusion? This is very scary that so many American women would love this book, after all we hate Sandusky !
B009NBSEXM|5|Emma and Snow are taken prisoners by Mulan and Sleeping Beauty. Regina gains her powers and forces Henry to come back to her home. Sebastian (The Mad Hatter) refuses to help Charming get Emma and Snow back and the seven dwarves discover if you leave town, you lose your Fairy Tale Land memories. And that is just the first ten minutes of the show. This episode showcases Regina's backstory with her mother Queen Cora and with Rumple. How Regina goes from a sweet young woman who just wants her freedom, to evil queen is a path that starts with Rumple. By the end of the episode, Regina realizes she cannot hold Henry hostage if she wants his love and sets him free to live with Charming. Charming talks the town into returning to their Storybrooke lives. And Emma and Snow get dumped into a pit prison with the last person on earth they expect to see.
B00881VLCE|5|A different way to play as the pieces are lined up for you on the side instead of all over the board which wastes time moving them out of the way.  The menu is professionally arranged which keeps it out of the way.  Plenty of room to work on.  Enough puzzle choices to last a long time.  I have and will continue to enjoy.
B007FY9ZWI|2|I haven't found this player to be very easy to figure out. I am using it on my Kindle Fire and I got the first song on it and can't figure out how to get any more songs on it. I also haven't figured out how to stop a song while it is playing. It does not have a stop button, only play, pause and FF and Rewind. I'm going to have to keep looking.
B00280LYIM|5|The book was amazing I keep reading over and over. It is a Great book I recommend it to you.
B007ZGO7EM|5|Needed help calculating how much fabric I needed ... took out the kindle and took care of the problem in an instant
B004SKJTY6|1|I don't remember ever downloading this movie. I will not watch it because I do not watch rated R movies. Where did it<br />come from. I must call them.
B0059XTUB8|5|Michelle Willaims did a great job as marilyn.

B00L9B7IKE|5|Fun read interesting way to write the novel!
630460291X|3|I don't have a great deal to say that hasn't been said dozens of times already.  My main point of this review is to warn about the DVD itself.  The version that I purchased is extremely odd in the fact that the entire film ISN'T on one side of the DVD.  Halfway through the movie you are forced to turn the disc over to see the rest of the film.  I'm not sure why this was done, the movie isn't THAT long, and I would think that the entire thing should have fit on one side.  Of course, the problem could just be that perhaps the copy that I received just happened to be an old one that was created in the early days of DVD.  In any case, just be careful when purchasing this one.
B00991TCOG|5|It doesn't get any better than this. She has pure talent. I mean this one girl can dance and play the violin on top of it all, she has every single song beautifully played perfectly. I can't wait to hear from her more.
B000IJ79WU|1|This was disappointing to watch, and not the Superman II that millions loved in the theaters.  The 1981 film was a great combination of action and fun; the Donner director's cut is more along his vision for the first film, trying to make the story of a man in tights as a plodding classical myth epic drama.  The ending was the worst of all-- I'm saving every reader with this spoiler -- it was the old &#34;fly a zillion times around the world to reverse time so it never even happened&#34; that Donner used in the first film.  Understandable for bringing Margot Kidder's Lois back to life, but an unnecessary deus ex machina for taking the three super-villains.away.... avoid it like kryptonite.
B004MC8CA2|5|I love youversion all the plans and options it has is amazing. I recommend this app to everyone. the wake upright plan has given me the streagth to continue to believe in him.
B009XIXVU6|5|I absolutely loved this book!<br />Had a lot of trouble putting it down. I loved how the style and the narrator change frequently throughout this amazing story.<br />Well done!
B00IX9UPV4|5|Can't say enough, use it all the time great tool.
B0086QS7N2|5|So, last night I saw the concert for this album and it was amazing. It was my 6th or 7th Rush show and the string ensemble was amazing. They actually played this entire album in the concert and I loved it. I hadn't bought the album before the concert because I was a little disappointed in the Snakes and Arrows album.<br /><br />This one is awesome however and highly recommended and not just for Rush fans.
0810994739|5|This series is a big hit!! The price on Amazon is excellent!!
B000XCZGV8|5|This is one of the best films I've ever seen on the subject of crime and criminals, and the effect crime has on the people who get caught up in it. Director David Fincher took the original memoir of San Francisco Chronicle journalist Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie) and fashioned it into a story that is less a whodunit than it is a character study of obsession and its consequences. We may never know the truth about the crazed killer, but this film gives us a good idea of what Graysmith and various other journalists, cops, and Feds went through in their pursuit of him. By concentrating on victims and bystanders rather than the perp himself, Fincher has managed to convey a sense of the true horror of violent crime. He's also made a suspense film that Hitchcock himself would admire. The entire cast is excellent, and the sense of time and place (1960s-70s San Francisco) is vivid. I'll never forget it. Highly recommended.
B000QCS8TW|5|Fantastic. I couldn't stop reading it. Bought the 2nd one after reading a few hundred pages of the first one.
B000Y5JFNY|5|I got this as a gift to give to another person but once it arrived, I couldn't part with it and had to buy that person something else. This box set is so gorgeous and makes a great item to add to my collection (already have Dances with Wolves and Schindlers List). Inside was a music box, post cards from the cast while they were shooting, a book about the real family and the cast and how the movie came to be. There was also a 4 disc box set to enjoy watching the movie again and again on our new blu ray player. I was able to share this musical with my kids (ages 3 and 5) and they were so into it the whole time. I love this item and hope everyone gets a chance to add it to their collection!!
B005ETA5K2|5|Product installed easily. Once installed, I was able to pick up full strength signals from a long distance. In-fact, before I had this product, I could only see my next door neighbors networks. Now, when I turn this on, I see almost everyone on my streets network. I needed this product for work because the router is to far away from my office, and now I got full strength, and fast connection. Great product!!!!!
B00000IP2L|1|I bought this CD back in December when it was an import, and was eagerly awaiting its arrival, as Zakk is one of my favorite guitarists.  However, this is not a good album at all, in fact, I think it's pretty close to  terrible.  The songwriting is horrible, and while the guitar playing is  good, the guitar tone on most songs is awful.  The biggest disappointment  is that there are few true rock albums released anymore, and I had hoped  that this would be one of the best.  Oh well, if you want great rock  albums, check out Mourning Widows and/or Gov't Mule.  Or even Zakk's own  Pride &amp; Glory CD, which is far better than this effort.
6305594252|5|A new kind of movie - make an effort to watch this movie.  The soundtrack is spectacular.
B002SSUQFG|5|If you want an affordable automatic watch with good design, and fashionable taste, this is a great option for you.  It is definitely better than the Timex that they are selling in J Crew stores.  I love it because it looks great and I don't have to worry about losing it.  I recommend this product for sure.
B005S9EJ14|5|I actually saw &#34;Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&#34; before I saw this one.  &#34;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is every bit as good as the second one!
B009JZSC9S|5|Even though this is an older program from television, it has me riveted to my seat! It has a nice mixture of &#34;whodunit&#34;, romance, as well as criminal mystery and there are some very good actors .<br />I am almost caught up with the end of the fourth season, and not looking forward to the end of all the episodes! I don't want it to end.
B00D7C8O38|5|This is the best multi purpose sandal shoe I have owned.  Not sure whether to call it a sandal or a shoe.<br />Either way, I find it perfect for travel as its multi-purpose flexibility allows me to not have to pack any other shoes.<br /><br />I can wear it to the airport, even when it is cold/snow outside (I wear socks), wear them for hiking at my destinations as they are rugged yet light, handle stepping over sharp rocks well, the feet are well protected and do not move around, and they are very comfortable, I wear them for horseback riding, for atv riding, for rock climbing, for beach rock/reef explorations, and to go out at night (with jeans/short) and still look decent.<br /><br />The only thing these may not work well with is if you have to go to a fancy place that requires a dress jacket and does not allow jeans/shorts, though they do look fine if you get the neutral/dark colors, not sure if they'd allow you in the place with &#34;sandals&#34;...  but I never go to such places anyways thus these fit the bill perfectly.  Or, I would not wear these if I was on some high intensity situation (such as paintballing in the woods, or some sort of law enforcement/military deployment, because if you are running off trail and running through vegetation stepping on loose sticks and loose rocks, a stick can easily go through one of the exposed holes or heel openings and really damage you; also no ankle protection, but to be fair, if you are in that situation I'd expect full AR 670-1 compliant army style boots)<br /><br />I also only pack a pair of thin light flip-flops (like the teva mush) and wear these most of the time while on my trips.  Flip flops for super beachy feel and don't need much foot protection; otherwise, these are it.<br /><br />I am on my second pair.  My first pair was bought 13 years ago, close to when the company first started and no one knew them.  Check out the pics.  They've lasted plenty of trips, hikes, you name it.  These were the black &#34;plastic&#34; original newports in black.  The plastic started to crack around the base (after 13 years of use) thus I ordered these which are leather as I don't want to risk having the black ones rip completely while I am on a trip.  No leather back then either.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- super comfortable<br />- breaths better than any shoe (lots of holes)<br />- foot is well protected on its most crucial points<br />- relatively lightweight<br />- can tighten them or wear them loose<br />- last very long time and remain very comfortable (be careful with the newport H2 which have the sawn sides;  that area apparently gets a lot of wear and the sewing breaks/wears out)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- some people think they look weird, but if you don't care about what people think, then this is a moot point<br />- may not be allowed in fancy dressed places

B005ZOBNOI|5|TFIOS was an awe inspiring book! It helps people who have had friends or family with cancer to understand more of what the person is going through internally. I was touched by Augustus and Hazel Grace's love but even more so about Hazel Grace's love for her parents. She was not afraid of dying but afraid of her parents hurting and not having a life after she passed away. She did not want to leave a scar. I also loved how the book ended like An Imperial Affliction. Bravo!
B00J7UL6V6|5|Love it!
