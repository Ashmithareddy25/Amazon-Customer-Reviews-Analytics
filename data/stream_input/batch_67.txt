B000OZTPIY|5|This thing is really nice, i have a 2015 polaris ranger midsize 570 and it fits great. Thing is tough and waterproof, it looks awesome, for this price u cant find anything even close to this quality without spending $200+
B0010DXYJU|5|This fit our 2012 Toyota Rav4 perfectly.
B00EFDYFHW|5|nice supports and free shipping
B00TUNSOMO|4|I don't have a large traditional boat, but what I do have is kayaks and I tried this spray out on them. Both of my boats had a lot of scuffs and &#34;water marks&#34; from fading and just general use. While this isn't going to restore the surface it does make it shine and look really good. I would recommend this quick wax to bring that shine back to your heavily used kayaks or other boats.
B00OUM8GLY|1|I drive Nissan Rogue and this was too small.
B001G7NRUG|5|Can't complain about OES Genuine.

B00652G4TS|4|It does what it says, but nothing more. It is only set to read the standard codes. If you want to know gas flow, tpms readings, etc you are out of luck. A scangauge would be more useful. This reads and clears trouble codes. Their customer service is great.

B00DWVNE3E|4|Very good
B0002V9IFK|5|Good product
B003Z6B4O2|5|Very nice liked a lot!!
B00KTHY2DA|1|Does NOT fit 2001 Toyota Celica. Checked to see if it would fit before I bought it and it claimed it would fit. Returning it would cost more than the product itself.
B00CSX42WY|3|The small emblem is great but the hood emblem did not last long.
B00RUDZ672|4|Looks good, didn't come with instructions (had to look it up on youtube), great price. Works good for me
B007AOSAM4|5|Great quality, fits perfect.

B003VORHN0|1|the worse bumber sticker ever.this would be a better bumber sticker &#34;if you voted for George bush jr or mit romney or any republician  you are a part of the problem&#34;. Here is why. Bush jr caused the financial crisis of 2007 by not regulating the banks, he gave huge tax cuts to wealthy, started a war that cost 2 trillion dollars, which  combined to put us in debt and caused a lot of problems for our country.  he also didn't believe in global warming and did nothing about the pollution in our atmosphere that contributes many diseases and premature deaths which results in billions of dollars in medical bills for the country. Obama did everything in his power to reverse the mistakes of the republican party. this is a fact.
B00BQAJZCM|3|Harness was not compatible with car. Had to swap my old motor onto new regulator assembly. Mounting holes did not match my old motor, had to drill the missing holes to mount the motor.
B001AX65QO|5|This workied well for my 88 W100.
B00D9C2CDO|1|Poor quality. It didn't even make it through one trip. On our way home we noticed a large tear in one of the seams & several rips across the front of the bag. We returned it as soon as we got home. Would not recommend.
B00MMKIKXU|5|works great, form fitted, easy to clean, looks like carpet...but not
B00JBI8ZOU|5|I had much better luck than the other reviewer.  High beam function works perfectly.  He's right, H7 bulbs have no high beam functionality, but the projector has a solenoid that adjusts the beam instead.  No service lights come on.  They fit like stock, and only have the same adjustment screw my stock ones had as the other reviewer pointed out, so that's OEM enough for me.  Love the clear lens for the parking/indicator lights.  It comes with amber colored bulbs to replace the clear ones the stocks have, since stocks have an amber lens.  They look phenomenal, and the nighttime performance is definitely a step up from stock.  Can't wait to eventually install HIDs.  I also hope to attach the halos to the DRL circuit if it's possible to isolate it from the main one.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I did in fact get the Service light after installing these.  It turns on only when the engine is running and you turn on the brights for more than a couple seconds, and the DRLs get disabled until you run an ignition cycle.  Disable the DRLs properly (there's a blue wire running to the BCM that needs to be disconnected, and then that connection grounded - do a Google search on properly disabling DRLs on this facelift version Cavalier, it's not hard).  Once you do this, the service light won't come on anymore and your bulbs will thank you, especially if you get HID Zenon later on - they don't like being run at partial voltage anyways.<br /><br />The halos can be easily wired up to turn on the same as DRLs would (except for illuminating the dash light).  Simply use the hand brake switch under the center console as your trigger.  I used a 5 pin relay that turns on when the hand brake is pulled and off when it's released.  In this configuration, the relay being &#34;off&#34; actually allows current to flow, due to the way the switch works.  You can also wire the halos to turn on with the ignition- just run a fuse tap to a fuse that turns on with the key.  You would want to do this anywayswith the DRL style setup, just in case your relay fails you don't want these lights to turn on when the ignition is not on.<br /><br />Best of luck and get these while they're hot, they're worth every penny.
B000RMRNOM|5|It is a little darker than the JD color.
B002ZS4QCS|5|Love these because they are functional but not bulky do when they are not in use they are discreet
B00CHR9XKC|5|Best gift I have ever purchased for someone. Came in a box with red velvet lining and the official Ferarri symbol sticker. It has a great weight and thickness to it. I want to purchase one for myself! Loved it!!
B000GBD2X0|5|These work just as intended.  Easy to install.  Great price

B005PZMLDY|2|Cheap material and very difficult to put on.
B000BUQOFO|5|Simple yet elegant.  An excellent solution.
B00KN0UOEE|5|The only protectant ill ever use. Ive been using this brand and product for years on my kayaks. keeps the colors from fading and keeps the plastic hull for drying out and cracking. Every kayaker needs this. Works well on my vinyl truck bed cover too.
B000GU293U|5|Works as advertised
B00K72C1T4|5|Bought two. Use everyday. So far so good.
B00BYNJ7HY|5|Definitely has made a difference
B00Y5G7FM6|5|Worked good and looked nice under the hood
B00LAK6MYW|5|Nice.
B001Q8HNYQ|4|Bought all 3 Viking's microfiber drying towel, wax removal cloth and wax applicator. Drying towel is of decent size and works well. Use wax removal cloths for polishing exterior and interior of car. Size is small yet did the job. The small blue wax applicator sponge absorbed liquid such as tire shine but later use to apply the same for exterior plastics fittings. For all 3, it served the purpose with a good price. Viking's wash bucket is on the way.
B002T4U05A|5|The shocks came very quick via USPS and work great!
B002W2V19I|5|Good quality and sturdy. Content and satisfied!
B00KTHZ2EI|5|Great cheap DIY remote. Came with 10 second instructions.
B00LU19Z5E|5|Love it, have had several fun comments from people who liked it :)<br />We saw it years ago and thought it was too funny, so had to get it when we got a wrangler.
B000M3V95U|5|Use with invisible glass reach and clean tool for crystal clear glass on shower enclosure
B000ALG86E|5|Good fit
B0010ADH9U|3|Good
B000C9M8B8|5|Amazon sold me the wrong part according to their part-finder the first time around, but after searching for the part number I needed I got this one. It works great.
B00KTJ0EA8|5|remote is great! but the key will not work on ignition, good only for door.
B0051D3MP6|5|no problems with it. Works like it should.
B001KSDZSA|5|nice
B00C2FKPCY|5|Awesome. works so good helpful.
B004I0DCTY|3|Great product.  I have an old 1999 crown victoria. Bought it a few years ago and it's been pretty good to me. Someone hit my parked car when I was traveling through St. Louis.  I hate that salvage yards are beginning to charge outrageous fees for these old parts, even cars like crown vics that are everywhere. The reviews were mostly good and so I bought this and it sat in my apartment for a few months.  I went in for my inspection and my car wouldn't pass without a replacement of the side light. About $15 for the part, and about $17 for labor and my car was back on the road.  Thank you to depo for selling these parts for older models.  Seriously, saved my job.  Edit: So, unfortunately the light burned out on this.  I still have my front headlight working so no need to change it yet though that's down the line.  I'll make sure to find an actual Ford replacement.
B000WJA5ZY|2|Doesn't tighten sufficiently to keep the mount from bouncing all over the place when riding a motorcycle.  Might be fine for lighter uses, but use only the shorty version if you're on a motorcycle.
B00TEA5PZC|5|I received this license plate frame for review. This is a nicely polished frame and has caps to cover the screw holes.
B001G7HW16|4|Fits my '92 Volvo 960 wagon
B005SEJTUA|5|Excellent high performance oil.
B005FQYOFQ|5|This is the third starter I have bought from this supplier for 3 different tractors. They work better than the OE starters.
B007ZHZ7EK|1|Plastic and cheap but still looks okay so i will wear them if i dont want to wear my helmet
B000N9XF0U|5|perfect
B007Y55KLS|5|Got the roll up custom sun shade and it fits my Hyundai Elantra 2013 perfectly!
B004NQO5P8|1|Do not buy this product before doing research on it.
B000Z0HVHA|2|Not heavy enough for a small electric air pump, drops to much voltage.
B0049MIBTM|3|It works very well
B00ZS275QC|5|Very good quality, installing them wasn't too bad except for the center consol section which had no instructions as to how to put it on.
B00KCQSOAA|5|Perfect
B0010XP880|3|Not so &#34;invisible&#34;!
B00B3O4AW6|5|Great quality. What more can you ask for? How about other color schemes?
B0119ZICTA|5|Great
B00Q4O1I2A|5|Love these pants!  They seem to run small.  Originally ordered a 12, but sent back for a 14.  I'm 5'10&#34;@165lbs.  Normally a 12 is comfortable, but they were very narrow in the thigh and short in the waist.  The 14's are perfect.  Just the right length.  Very nice feel to the material, with adjustable knee pads.
B000E7YP7I|5|Really needed something to organize my trunk space.  This is great.  I spent a long time looking for a rigid base/bottom organizer, so i could lift it out without the whole thing collapsing.
B001C6JCMI|5|worked as expected
B000JZN0SU|5|These wipers are really good I have been buying them for years and years. they always fit and i always get a little more than a year of service from them. i would recommend these to anyone that wants a reliable wiper for a great price.
B00GSAUHB8|5|living in florida you learn you need something to try to keep your vehicle cool  this sunshade is the trick works like a charm
B00P59LH3A|4|I was able to make a dear friend smile with this rare find
B007X4F2G8|1|Poor quality.  Brackets that hold the ladder to the dock will not last even an hour with average sixteen year boys using the ladder.  The ladder itself is very flimsy.  It would have cost too much to send it back so I had to throw it away and search elsewhere.  Sigh...
B00RECPABG|5|Love it
B0085Y8UMI|5|so far so good
B00NTR458Y|5|Received it very quickly! Over all it is a good product. It was easy to install, and is fairly bright. I have it in the rear window of my truck. The flash patterns are great and is definitely a great add on. The price tag is very competitive given the quality and service on offer.
B00K24JB2W|5|I love it! Perfect fit, came within a few days and is made good!
B000GS1ESI|5|Pipes fit perfectly..and sound amazing...installation very easy
B00873J0YY|5|The TMS J-Bar Racks are wonderful. It was really easy to install but would have been better with directions. I had to go on You tube to see how to put it all together.<br />Also a extra set of straps would be nice. If It's a really windy day the kayaks tend to shift a little.  As far as the delivery, I got the product earlier than anticipated.  I have purchased other items through Amazon and have never been disappointed.
B00D1SWXSU|4|Looks great. Good quality. No bad smell. Inner rubber seems to be of good quality. Dropping a star as it hardly covers half diameter of steering wheel.
B00JWO4S94|2|I purchased it for a friend, my sons recommend it to me.<br />For the price I think great! They like theirs also!
B00V5J6JU0|4|Very easy kit to install. Only issue I had. They drilled one of the rear blocks slightly off for the alignment pins. Had to file the holes out to make it fit. Also the u-bolts are way to long you need to cut them after install to proper length.
B0006IX878|4|a must to go with the carbon water filter! Works great
B00KD403BO|5|My 180 k mile honda Accord runs great with these plugs.
B00FZKHTOK|5|Nice product . Well discribed
B00EC2CG9U|5|Very Nice
B00B2AF5LQ|4|These did not fit my 2000 jeep Cherokee sport, I had to grind off a portion of one end to make it fit.  Otherwise it is a great break line and I am glad I gave them.
B00EQD0JJO|5|Everything in the kit fit perfectly and my little motor now runs great. Shipping was pretty good from Leader's RPM. I think it took about a week.
B00429NKWK|5|Phenomenal product! The kit and video kinda make it seem like it's only for one, but you can definitely make it work for two headlights. The white towels you get are completely gone after the first, but a simple paper towel works fine for the steps. Headlights look brand new on a 2007 Jetta, all for $20.
B00E6TW3YC|5|This is exactly what I was looking for!  It looks awesome on my car and I think it will last.  Good quality metal frame with decal stick-on letters.  None of the letters have fallen off or faded yet.  I've only had it about 2 months, but I love it!
B00U0GEEHY|4|It is good. Not bad for the price just beware it is the smaller skinnier lanyards. Which is okay with me.
B004IL96U2|4|Nice piece. But for the price they least they could have done was inlcude the pin that holds it in place.
B009G533OU|5|Haven't installed yet but price is half what tire shop wanted.
B00199N4B8|5|Works as it should. Always buy oem. Aftermarket parts have become unreliable and cheaply made
B004V4FUL0|5|Front mats fit my car like a glove... now the back ones... they came with the same location clips, which on my car instead of two on the lower corners, there is 1 in the middle, they work though, makes the car look 10x better.
B000LV7XR6|5|Purchased for my Pontiac G8 Base. It fit perfectly and works great.
B000RDJNOE|4|Kind of expensive for what they are but the specs have to be pretty close.  Easy to install in back cargo compartment in my 2006 Ford Escape Hybrid.  They slide right into the space and have &#34;up and down&#34; marked on them.  Don't know why they use such a big box for the little filter.
B00UM9LS5U|3|look good but pretty light weight, not sure its going to last long,,,
B000BWDVT4|5|great OEM replacement
B00651C998|3|Signal is not strong but looks great on truck
B009HU5LAS|5|As Advertised
B0031GVBGM|5|nice
B008B5U5U6|5|No problems.
B00ARURM3G|5|Just what I ordered shipped fast easy to install
B001LQJWF6|5|Just as described. Looks great.
B0026Y81VS|3|2014 F150 crew cab. Works great. Looks alright. The velcro straps that hold it while rolled up could use a redesign. If you place it too close to the cab, the heat makes it expand slightly on hot days and it rubs on the weather stripping of the back window and makes a horrible squeaking sound. When installing, keep at least an inch between the edge of the cover and the rear window. The velcro straps get tucked away under it and if its too close to the cab, good luck jamming a finger down there to get them.
B006B376WK|5|I have a convertible with black interior and it gets quite dusty.<br /><br />A few swipes with this and everything looks perfect!
B00AN5S1WG|5|I ordered this for my 2003 Ford Expedition XLT 4WD and everything worked great. I have now used these brake kits on 3 of my 4 vehicle and no vibrations or noise yet. This is, by a landslide, cheaper than going to any parts store and I have found the quality to be excellent. It comes with all brake pad hardware and even the brake lube. As an ASE Master Technician I would recommend these kits to anyone.  **UPDATE** So I installed these about 1 month ago now and no noise, vibrations or concerns. I have however found that unlike my other 2 cars, it does take noticeably more brake pressure to stop the vehicle. I cannot confirm if it is due to pad material or rotor material but it does take more to stop the vehicle than before. I probably never noticed on my cars due to the weight difference. Would still buy again though.
B00J7RB72M|1|Cheap product, horrible construction, don't waste your money on this one. Spend a little more and get something that will last. If bought it will need replacing with a month.
B00A82C3VO|4|Ordered three of these to replace the three OEM batteries that drive my Black & Decker SPCM1936 battery-driven (36V) lawn mower.  I opened the 36V battery-pack assembly by removing five screws and easily replaced my old batteries.  Putting the top back on the assembly was a pain in the butt, though, but I managed it after about 15 minutes of prayer.  The lawn mower is much more peppy and drives through the grass much more easily.<br /><br />I've only used them one time but they appear to be equal to the lawn-mowing task.  I'd give them a five-star rating but I've only used them once so I'm not sure how long they'll last.  The OEM batteries lasted four summers.
B00480FIDW|4|Bright not hid bright or even close but I expected that they are a clean white look.good took my hid kit off my ram 1500 tired of experience bulbs put these in like I said not hid but im still happy
B0007VANJK|5|If you made it this far you are like me and too cheap to have one installed by the stealership or Uhaul. Good choice. I did my research and this is the ticket for a Tacoma. This thing is solid, the paint is thick, and the welds are good. You get the &#34;quality&#34; feeling from it. It took me and a buddy about one and a half hours and a 6 pack to install, although you really only need an extra pair of hands for about 5 minutes while you lift and pin it into place. My biggest complaint is that it was a hair too snug and we had to bend the ears out about 1/4&#34; between the two of them, but I greatly prefer that over a sloppy fit. The holes lined up perfectly with a little bumper wiggling.<br /><br />If you have a 1/2&#34; socket set and a spare evening there is no reason not to do it yourself. Between the youtube video from Curt and the instructions almost anybody could figure it out. If you are installing it on a truck that is a few years old you will want to get some pb or wd40 and a wire brush if not a tap to clean the threads out as some of them are exposed from the factory. I installed mine 4 days after buying it and had no problems with the threads.<br /><br />As far as the shipping went, there was one puncture in the box where the receiver was, but it arrived in excellent condition. The paint wasn't chipped off anywhere.
B000E8OUUO|5|These have to have the spring from the old one removed and reinstalled on this one. A bit of work but once I got the hang of it, the second one was easier.  My mechanic was impressed I tackled it on my own.  The ride was restored to my van.  One thing, it would be a good idea to replace the plastic bearings (you'll know what I'm talking about when you take it off) at the top or it may make a bit of noise when you hit bumps.  I read somewhere later after I installed that it was the thing to do.  I can live with the occasional noise...
B0084AA2LK|1|Smelled horrible when you drive, burns off within a few days.
B004RNSQO8|5|I've always used multi-viscosity oils (10-40) in air cooled engines (lawn mowers etc.) not by choice, but because most auto parts don't carry 50 wt oil at a reasonable price.  Switching to Kendall 50 wt reduced oil consumption dramatically and with no loss of coverage.  I will buy more.
B00CASDZKC|5|saved my brand new camry's leather seats. kids keep kicking,  this product is awesome
B001DRLQ6Q|5|Perfect
B00NWGZ3A6|4|It's a real nice meter. Auto ranging works great! It's very compact and lightweight, the display is larger than other meters this size. For me, as it turned out, this meter is not good for measuring ohms on my rebuildable atomizers.  I need 0.00, It only goes to 0.0 ohms. That being said, this meter is accurate, unlike other small meters I have used that will read 1.5 ohms just touching the leads together and read 2.0 ohms when testing my RDA (rebuildable dripping atomizer)... subtract base reading to get RDA reading of 0.5, with this auto ranging Etekcity meter none of that is necessary, it reads 0.5 ohms. I would have rated it 5 stars if it had two digits after the decimal point so I could read the 0.54 ohms that it is instead of just 0.5 ohms. Also I ordered this P600 meter and was sent the UT120C. On the Etekcity site they only have the UT120C, so, I presume it is an upgrade, no explanation came with it. PS: I recently found the Hertz function came in handy when the power went out, used it to adjust my generator speed so output was a nice steady 60 hrtz.
B00068XCQU|4|just what my batteries need !
B007OW6MD6|5|Toyota Genuine Parts. I had bought a pack of 6 for about 4 bucks at Pep Boys.  But, they are nylon and, you can not tighten nylon much or they may split.  Once I seen these via Amazon, I made purchase which is a pack of 10 for several bucks, Genuine Toyota AND, the price is fair (I had a 35 dollar order so, shipping was free). They are not nylon so, they will not split.  I did not open Pep Boys so, I will be taking back a.s.a.p..
B00NKMX27S|5|excellent product. would recommend it.
B005JVPFJG|3|I measured my head to be 57 cm so I purchased this one. It says 58 cm in it, I was expecting this to be a comfortable size. However it was way too tight (hurts my head) that makes me want to exchange for a larger one. The helmet is well made, just sizing is way off.
B000CSOIGM|1|Not for 97 grand cherakee shiping it back,not worth the money! So chuck it and move on
B00G620ZVU|5|Best lights I have ever had piece of cake to install and extremely bright
B000CLAYUS|5|I love this product. Partly because my previous filter was so filthy and hadn't been replaced for years, but after installing this filter the vents in my car blow really well. The difference was night and day.<br />I would highly recommend this product.
B00U5THV6C|1|Made with very cheap metal,stripped on the first kick!
B005FL2T3A|5|They work great so far.  No warped rotors and stop very good
B00XAZVBAU|5|Rubber boot much beter quality than what I pulled out.  Fixed the misfire / rough idle . Auto zone wanted $64.00 for .. I like the package quantity choices .  Thanks
B00Z8TGYR6|5|OPT7 is a great product. If I am looking for lighting I will go with OPT7 hands down. The LED taillight bar is just as discribed, nice and bright and very easy to install. Comes with everything you would need to install. Product ships the next day and I receive them in about a 1 week coming from across country. I recommend OPT7 to anyone looking for lights or admiring mine!
B001AO80FW|5|Had one of these installed on an 09 Titan XE with towing gear ratio, 3&#34; flowmaster, and a K&N. Without the rev limiter, it winds up to a more appropriate level before shifting. Acceleration is better, deceleration is smoother, overall the truck is faster and tows better. Passing gear is far more effective on the freeway as well. All the bros with their girly F-150s and the farmers in their Rams can't keep up. (the chevys never stood a chance, even without the tuner!) Sadly, I sold my tuner with that truck. I have another Titan now with a brute force and a Gibson 4&#34;, and I'm purchasing another Max Energy to wake it up! The thing is, it's far more effective with an upgraded exhaust and intake, at minimum. Without those things, your pickup isn't getting enough air to efficiently burn fuel or make it worth tuning. Stock setup is designed for minimal emission, and that's it. It's not the most efficient, and definitely not conducive for power.
B00ZY2AE6E|5|I spend a lot of time at the computer and this Gelepad saves me so much pain and related stress! The padding so comfortable and supportive. What a fabulous invention! It stays right where I put it and the adhesive is so flexible, I can travel with it and use it anywhere. Even after a year of use, it still provides support and adheres to any desktop like new.
B000BY5GZE|5|Awsome dude..
B00AZP87NW|5|Worked as advertised.
B0041DXAI6|5|Quick shipping, great price, easy install thank you for a great sale
B00II6OJO6|5|They are loud and effective.
B007NGB512|5|Been looking for months for a leather motorcycle jacket, LOVE this one.  The leather is really soft without being thin and flimsy.  I love the stud detail, it is just enough to give it a unique look without being over the top.  And you definitely cannot beat the price.  I usually take a small in tops, but ordered the Medium, it fits great, room to wear a sweater or sweatshirt underneath.  This jacket is a must buy.
B00QHJ8ITS|5|Proper
B00JE2MTYA|5|perfect fitment.
B00YBGCAFW|5|Worked great... Easy to use
B004BWU8H8|4|Lock could be stronger and an option for an electronic release would have been nice.  Very well constructed and fit perfectly.
B000E5U4O8|5|Fit perfect so far so good.
B00DLMP978|5|Went with the MaxPider for 2015 CX-5 because they were less expensive than the Husky or Weather Tech and the reviews were good. These mats are great, fit right in no problems. Thinking of getting a set for the Mazda 5 too.
B00GR3ZZ1I|5|Great buy, it gave my bike the get up and go it needed.
B00PE5ABBE|5|nice

B00Z7KIZPA|5|My purses are all too large to fit inside the pouch part, but for most people that would be more than adequate. It still works just as described, ensuring my purse doesn't go flying into the back of the car.  I will be purchasing more for my friends and family members.
B00FYHUZHW|5|I was very happy to receive this in the mail, I just wish they had block lettering so I don't have to change out the current block lettering on my car.
B006WPQNB2|5|This replaced a porta potti I had for over 20 years...and I wish I'd have bought this sooner!  It is absolutely the queen's throne!
B008HZP52S|5|Yup.
B000GOJWBS|4|Works and fits good, but it doesn't seem to throw out as much air and the A/C doesn't seem to be as cool. but no more noise.
B00IWLOQ90|4|A bit pricey but does the job for less than OEM.
B006QH56GE|5|awesome
B001DRH7OG|5|complete package for installation
B00Z7KIZPA|5|Hard to install in our 2013 MDX because the center console has 2 doors so I had to jury rig the attachment of the bottom cord.
B000W3RU9Y|5|Work great to keep my pet barrier in place and keeps my 80 pound lapdog from riding shot gun
B000C32MWO|5|awesome
B00NP3ELWW|5|This fits husbands ZTR perfectly and accommodates his oversized insulated thermos type drink container perfectly
B000C9CB8S|5|Fit perfectly with no need for shims.  Threads were protected during shipping.  It arrived in pristine condition, ready to install.  Glad I made the choice to buy this one.
B00BPDJZZC|5|Perfection!
B000GV1GQU|1|Bent and had to make it fit. None of the holes lined up.
B00GZ55DPQ|5|Beautifully done
B007OW67QI|5|Perfect in every way.  Super easy to install and it works beautifully.  Wish everything was this easy!
B000TYTR42|4|Working great..
B0000AZ9KS|5|Way easier than the twisting kinds, this thing is sweet for hauling groceries or blocking off a portion of the truckbed to hold skateboards.
B0002MA7YK|5|work great o my Trans Am
B00KWK0CCO|5|Used this to replace the broken fob case for my brother's 2006 Scion xB. Worked perfectly.
B006EGAIJ2|4|Works well
B007ZDV7I4|1|Front did not fit front my 69 Mustang correctly, (rear was fine) where sway bar ends met end links were nowhere near a 90 degree angle, closer to 45 degrees causing a bind in the end link bolt causing it to eventually bend link bolt once lowered to ground. I contacted Belltech (Adam Tormey from Belltechs web sight) with pictures & they said it looked fine, said that it would be fine once on ground referencing the enclosed picture, guessing they have sublet to China too...
B004GCMYFM|5|I was very pleased with the fit and the quality. Specially for the price. It fit my 03 s model like original.
B000C3YT16|5|Great product. Gives the engine a deeper, yet subtle tone. Installs really easy and fits in the engine compartment great.
B00YUZ2MGG|3|basic key, empty plastic shell, maybe sombody can cut the key
B00VAY67MU|4|Matts were great. They don't fit exactly to my car,  but they make due. I have a 2001 Honda Accord
B001PL7ZA6|4|I really like the heatshield products and use one in my BMW 335i as well.  They fit great and really do contribute to lower temperatures in the car than most other similar products.  The one in my F150 is a little bulky, but really that is due to the size of the windshield and not so much the product itself.  It can be a little bit of a pain for one person to put this up from the driver's seat without really reaching across the cab.  This seems just a tad too small, but it really does cover almost the entire glass area.  I do with the cutout for the mirror was a little different as I feel like I will wear out the sunshade the way I have to bend it to get it past the mirror every time i put it up or take it down.  The product rolls up easily, has velcro to secure it while closed and fits nicely under the rear seat.  I would certainly buy this again should I need a new sunshade.  It will certainly help protect your vehicle by keeping the sun off your dash and front seats and keep the car cooler than it would be with most other sunshades.  Please note I live in Phoenix, AZ and we get some serious heat and this works here so it should work wherever you live.
B005BNZEZC|5|Very nice quality, cant beat price compared to other brands on here. Works as it should.
B0000AXRH5|4|Okay.
B001EW86GS|5|You can't go wrong, this stuff works great
B0048F05A8|1|short on one side  the trim that was used to finish the product didn't make it to the end in some places just called it done.  very disapionted to say the least now i have to buy another one from someone else
B006N91C2M|5|It's a battery.  Hope it last a long time.<br /><br />I ordered 2 of these for my 2012 Dodge Cummins (yeah a &#34;GM&#34; battery in Dodge).  They showed up on different days.  But it was still quick and the price is good.
B00LEBLI82|5|Just as promised
B002UC2Y0K|5|Perfect...  Needed that extra length...
B0000AXR7A|5|Good Experience.
B007XE8C74|5|Works fine.  The menus take a little time to get used to, but I'm new at this myself.
B00JJTZPH6|5|Fast shipping one is a little darker than the other but oh well
B00C79GZR4|5|Back beat,<br />the word is on the street.<br />That the rock knocked my fog light out.<br />I'm sure you've heard it all before,<br />But you never really had a doubt.<br />I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do,<br />About my car.<br /><br />And all the roads we have to walk are winding.<br />And all my lights that lead me there are lighted.<br />There are many things that I would like to say to you, But I don't know how.<br /><br />So maybe...<br />I'm gonna leave this review that saves you...<br />And after all...<br />My fog light's no longer broke at all!<br /><br />BROLO!<br /><br />~Author Shane Moore
B00396CZC8|5|Well made, heavy duty hose.
B004HCS4PK|5|great product
B00JFDDTUG|5|Perfect fit of course!
B00V6XXA4S|4|Good product
B00GHS7IGS|4|good to 80%; accessories given along did not fit perfectly; the DIY manual served its purpose
B00852684M|3|It's okay for the price...
B010EYQ60E|5|Perfect choice for those bumper sticker lovers.  Good quality!
B009ERWWQ0|5|Works and fits great!  Easy to install on my 2007 Chevy HHR LT.<br /><br />The first one got lost in the mail, but Amazon was fast at sending me another one.
B00GN76JEU|2|Not very useful , the neck would shake with a slight movement, its like bouncing up and down, and also due to the fact that the mirror is deep inside the plastic case (or I must say the plastic wall around the glass) it is making difficult to view if you make and angle, also i did not like the overall quality of the plastic and the mirror.<br /><br />The main draw back is its too much bouncy so you cannot trust this .
B002G3OG6S|4|worked well.
B000KL19SQ|5|Got for both our vehicles. Fit perfect and catches everything.
B0006IX7WY|4|Have an outdoor kitchen on your RV or sick of stuff flying around like a tornado in your inside fridge?<br />This is for you. We use ours on our inside fridge of our hybrid but my in-laws use it in the outside kitchen fridge of their big RV.<br />Keeps the door from trying to fly open as soon as you open the hatch with cans of pop or whatever.<br />Love it and for $5 it is totally worth it!
B000EDSSDY|5|It's a level.
B00GWXXSBW|5|elegant
B002D3KR4Q|5|Covers the existing scratches and protects from getting more. Very satisfied.
B00EKTIW3Y|4|Need a little thicker tape inside..
B001EYFN94|5|I  use this to blind customers and their neighbors while delivering pizza. It has a relatively flat design, so it doesn't roll around on the floorboard.
B000VU9D20|4|Nice quality
B00BMDYQ86|5|Great looking and feeling shifter. Easier to shift than the plastic factory shifter.  Makes the interior look better too.
B009TA7Z64|5|My Mother Loved These.  She's had the same in her Maxima and had to have them for her Infiniti G37
B007XE5LTG|5|The device went straight to the problem!!! This scanner pays for itself in savings!!
B00COVLQ3S|1|I have a black Volvo C70. I keep this car spotless. I washed and clayed it below applying the wax. Did small sections with a very small amount and buffed immediately as instructed. Car looked great. I took it to the beach on a day when it was 95 and sunny. When I got out of the car all the streaks from where the wax was applied were visible. When I got home I wiped the car down with a detailer and and it looked great again. Same thing happened a week later.<br /><br />Heard a lot of good things about the quality and longevity of this product I am very disappointed in the response by  Zymol. Their answer was &#34;we cannot promise good results unless you use all our products together.
B002OKFRY8|5|As advertised.
B000FNSTV4|4|works as advertised
B004IVEJYU|5|Fit my 2012 1500 GMC Sierra seats like a glove! Protects my seats and has kept them clean and I'm pretty tough on my truck with whitewater kayaking, caving and 2 kids!
B00C53J8G2|5|Works perfect, and is actually better than the original one that came with the car. It was also very easy to set up, nothing technical involved, just things like open the door, and push the buttons. Do not be afraid to buy this for any reason.
B00CNW76F0|5|Took care of my problem.
B00TQSO7Z6|5|Need a bit handy skill to stick it straight! Good material and protect the tank painting very well.
B000ALBZJY|5|This product works as promised. It took all of 10 minutes to fix the window power connection
B001T9QPH8|5|Working perfectly!
B003UT3S6Q|5|Breaks up brake dust and road grime easily. Spray on, let it do it's magic, agitate a little, and you have clean rims. Very easy to work with and hasn't damaged my rims or my brakes. The smell isn't horrible as others have noted, but it is unique and isn't something you want to be smelling for an extended period of time. Will buy again once I run out. This does what soap and water won't do.
B00FALW0RU|4|Very nice
B007S2TR1Q|5|Works flawlessly
B00XPL88NC|4|Better than the short version. Looks good
B00GHSD3O4|5|NOTE: This DOES fit all 2002-2006 Chevy Avalanches regardless of what Amazon says. If you search the web, you'll find the DORMAN 45679 is an exact replacement for that truck. I'm very pleased with these being that on the Avalanches the factory bumpers tend to fall off.
B000IXFRVQ|4|Comfortable and does the job though I use a hair tie to keep the back parts together.
B0014FGVVW|1|Missing Thumb Wheel. Reordered another. Hope inspector #6 did their job. Or is that asking to much nowadays.
B0039538RK|4|good
B002W27Y9E|5|They are perfect for those who look to save room.  Actually haven't &#34;used&#34; one of them yet but I put one in water and they are quite impressive.  I can see having the need for them down the road and these will fit the bill.
B000066OC7|5|Thank you!
B001QV6JVG|3|Solid good bushings and parts but the nut has no locking feature. Within 6 weeks the nut backed off and I lost half the bushing somewhere. If I buy again, I will use double nuts or loctite.
B004EDCR0U|5|Exactly what I wanted, on time at a good price
B00OEZ6LPA|5|Great arrived on time and fitted my vehicle.
B00HZSNV4C|5|I used this product on my Class C RV after a 3,000 mile trip.  I was very impressed.  I just sprayed it on and waited about a minute and hosed it off.  Without doing anything else the bugs just rinsed right off.  This is an excellent product!  I will purchase again.
B0009IK9DG|4|Sturdy and durable handle. I just wish the bristles were a little more course.
B00303EG7M|5|Nice kit just what I needed
B005RA7074|5|perfect fit and function
B0099Z4MJ2|5|Easy to use, well worth it
B009RNQLE0|4|it's hard to find a cup or water bottle that isn't too big for it. other than that it's great. looks really nice.
B002PQSFYK|5|Excellent product and great price with speedy delivery
B007IUPF7I|5|Everything was great. Thanks
B002R4U72I|5|delivery on time............. this wrap allows for multiple types of applications dealing with exhaust systems and does the job well.
B0052SF0LO|5|This thing is great! Nice long cord for the solar panel, very bright, and the detachable light source could be used for an emergency.
B000SBCHCA|5|worked
B000221H08|5|Good stuff
B00540RHMU|5|all good thanks ..
B0001EVSMO|3|The Auto Ventshade Bugflector II (part number 25148) is a pretty solid product. However, there were a few problems with the item I received. The first was the overall fit on my vehicle (2004 Chevrolet TrailBlazer). The product fit, for all intents and purposes, on the front of my hood. The problem occurred when I noticed an approximately 1&#34; difference in clearance from the passenger side to the driver side of the hood (possibly due to warping, possibly due to poor-fitting installation hardware). Second problem was the cheap hardware included for installation. The rubber grommets break off fairly easily, as one was missing not even after 24 hours of owning the product. The rubber stoppers that they include to protect the hood have a cheap adhesive, and one disappeared at residential road speed (35 mph). Furthermore, the aforementioned difference in clearance caused the bug deflector to sit oddly on the front of my truck, causing a very annoying squeak over every bump in the road, no matter how small. I'm giving this product a second chance, as I know too many people who back AVS on making a solid, well-working product. Perhaps mine was the black sheep of the group.
B00KGID9GI|5|Great price product as described with fast delivery
B002DZJQ0A|5|works like the original
B000COO028|5|Fit perfect!
B007GCI2MI|5|Installed this boost gauge at the same as a GS fuel pressure gauge.  High quality, kit included all that was needed to install.  Instructions very clear and easy to follow.  Would recommend without hesitation.<br />JimB
B00NL2RAC0|2|Didn,t fit properly
B000GKTYNI|5|Good product that keeps my car running well. There are stronger versions but this 50/50 is all that I really need and it has been working fine. Will reorder when needed.
B000IYHXO4|5|I replaced both front wheel bearings on a 2006 FX35, the car runs like a dream again, it's only been a couple wks since installation, but the price and quality couldn't be better at this point....
B00BI79FYG|5|Perfect fit! On time delivery!
B000C0WKUG|5|Great Item - Fast Shipping - Will Purchase Again
B008KSI75Y|5|Worked perfectly
B0015YD3AY|5|as described. Thanks!
B0053BUCRM|5|Thank You,<br /><br /> Tbone
B00CE2Q4LQ|5|Good quality
B002XHDHPS|5|With the help of my husband we got this to stick nicely on the wall of my daughter's nursery.  She's 14 months now and it still looks as perfect as the day we put it up when I was still pregnant.  It was a little tricky to pry off and get to stick but our teamwork helped so we didn't have any disasters!  I also want to add that we have textured walls as you can see in the picture.
B000BYGK0E|5|2006 Toyota Camry SE V6 with over 95K. It was time for timing belt service, so went ahead and did everything, including all belts, tensioners, plugs etc. Was I amazed when I got my car back. Smooth acceleration, quieter idle, and definitely more noticeable pickup. The 3.3L V6 already rocks, now it feels like when I first bought it 9 year ago
B006O85M1Y|5|does what it's supposed to...
B001445AU6|5|Very good huffing pad works like it's supposed to
B0030BVAPU|5|Still looking great, 2 years after being on back of car !
B00F2HUHHC|4|Works great
B009EU5ZM0|5|good product good service
B001UC729O|4|I like it.  Changing out the original, still working alternator was a bit of a pain because the latch on the belt tensioning pully wouldn't latch - but that's the truck's fault, not the alternator's.  It's only been on the truck for a couple of days so I can't say how long of a life it will have at this point.  The best way to get the belt pulled out so you can latch the tensioner pully is to use a framer's claw hammer with claws that stick out straight from the back of the hammer head.  Then hold the hammer with the left hand and reach long bar down in there to flip the tensioner latch.<br /><br />If installing on a Ford 6.0 diesel, there are two other things you should do.  First, also order a smaller diameter pully for the alternator.  They're also on Amazon.  The smaller pully gives you higher output at an idle because the alternator turns faster.  Second, From the green output connection on the back of the alternator, run a second red / positive cable to the positive terminal on the driver's side battery.  The cable needs to be 19&#34; long from eye to eye on the terminals.  We have a good shop in Anchorage that makes cables while you wait for a few minutes - Go Polar Wire.  Preferably have the cable made from #6 cable.  Leave the factory cable in place.  The problem with it is Ford went really cheap on a small cable, it can't carry the amperage needed.  There's room on both the alternator and battery terminal to install the second cable.
B00CWNVAPW|1|Doesent fit a s2000 waste of money
B000ER47ZS|5|Nothing like this wonderful emblem to piss off Christians.
B0056BWU38|3|Works well, the only drawback is the bottom is open. However, you can put heavy items inside the net to secure the bottom.
B007XY5K6K|4|Works great... but can ONLY cut through thin vinyl.... careful it doesn't get through the thick stuff.
B00CUDYES4|5|These are comfortable for a XXXL kind of man. They come long as all get out, but some trimming of the length hits the sweet spot. I like the visibility feature. They are more comfortable for a man with a gut...no extra buckle & I can get in my front pockets while wearing them
B0031GWMI8|5|Works well. Fits my 1999 F-150 perfectly
B007ETFOVK|3|Purchased 2; one for each of my vans. One van does not have any rear or side windows so was looking for a little peace of mind. Easy installation, also purchased a 4.3 LCD rear view mirror/monitor. Clear picture.<br /><br />One big complaint; neither camera displays the parking lines. Fortunately I can just see the rear bumper so I can gauge where to stop.
B00B2POFE4|1|HORRIBLE FABRICS, NOT AS DESCRIBED, WASTE OF MONEY
B000WEIIZI|5|Installed as expected,  The cover has a more solid feel to it than others I've purchased.
B0041LN1L4|4|Offers some reassurance in a city of bulldozers.
B004AIGB4W|5|This was an exact replacement.  Just what I needed
B0094JKMII|5|Easy install. Very sturdy.  Hooked it up in 10 mins. Connected a Thule storage unit drove 800miles. I also had to connect my bike rack straps to it bc I have a plastic spoiler on my explorer. It supported it with no problem.
B00D3QVGOC|5|Used this on my 75 dodge D-100 since an original one is like 200 bucks hahaha idiots!
B00N2DHF82|1|It dont fit on a honda civic 01 coupe so I dont know why it says that it fits. I buy it a few months ago and had to return it.
B008CQUVN0|5|fit great
B00H3R94GY|2|This item lasted 13 months (12 month warranty) perfect fit, unacceptable service life .....Don't buy
B005RSUQAE|5|Well made.
B00YA06OCO|1|Seems very well made, but before I hook them up I need to know which wire is ground? Red is hot, white or black is ground??<br />Which one? Zero instructions in box or online.<br /><br />Ok figured out black is ground. But it gets much worse. Its a two sided light, the problem is the running lights shine on one side, while the turn/brake light shines the other side !!  We need both functions to shine up the same side, or both sides.<br />As sold its useless, illegal, and stupid. Idiotic for the chinese to make them this way, and idiotic for me to buy them not knowing exactly how they worked. If I had known this in advance I never would have bought them. Shame on amazon/seller for not describing properly.<br />And these are a prime item !!! Goes to show Amazon Prime is no advantage in picking a good product.
B00SH28LSG|5|My bike look nice like gp bike
B007RYMT7O|4|as listed fast shipping
B0041QVBIE|5|Delivered fast... Good product quality
B00G4ATR54|4|It works great

B000C71HNA|5|good product
B00JGJH8QU|5|Works well.
B00FN1T3D6|5|So much better than my last bike rack.  It was level, stable and was terrific on the road.
B00OQW1LUQ|5|(Edit: This is my Follow up- I REALLY like this helmet! I've now ridden over 100 miles in it. Light weight, excelent visibility, looks great, bugs wipe off easy! I would buy it again!!!)   I just got it today & I like it! Nice retro look. Looks like a quality product. I really like the fast shipping (I paid extra for next day delivery). I live in &#34;rural&#34; Montana and usually I expect an extra day. It arrived almost 8 hours ahead of the deadline. I haven't ridden in this helmet yet, but so far, I am very happy with this. I only gave 4 stars due to the fact that I haven't had it very long. I will do a follow up in a week or so...
B007TY3GOC|5|Great product
B00404WDUC|5|As described
B00BWNS96G|1|Buyer beware.  These are a one time use.  Which means that when light burns out it is not replaceable.  The only thing you can do is replace the whole unit again.  Also it does not fit well as the connections are much longer than factory ones.
B000I1YYUI|5|Work as advertised.  Very import to keep pilot bits sharp otherwise it will slip and break your cutter
B00VEMKZQW|5|Very satisfied with this product!
B0027QWNDM|5|Great Deal!
B00D9C2CDO|5|Waterproof when used properly. Had a heavy rainstorm during the first part of the vacation; it lasted for several hours. Absolutely no water got in. Towards the end of the vacation, I didn't stuff it like I did at first and got some water inside during another, briefer, storm.<br /><br />Heavy duty material and I was able to get it to work with just a front and back bar. There's no place on my van to attach the side ties so I attached it to the corners. I'll use clips next time.<br /><br /> The only way to improve this would be to include a step ladder!
B0031BLUWW|5|Over the stock shocks these are much better. I replaced my stock 2009 Harley iron shocks with these and they helped it a lot! Before the stock shocks felt like they weren't absorbing much, I'm 160# so that makes a difference but I have these 3 clicks in and have improved the comfort of the ride.  The look it gave my bike too is awesome! I've notice in corners and some speed bumps in scraps but nothing bad.
B001NAP0K6|5|As expected
B00PBDT3B8|5|Easy to install and works great.  Used on a 115hp Yamaha and it does the job.
B002G244UM|2|All of the bristles of these brushes come out SO easily. Wouldn't purchase again.
B004SCETXU|5|I needed a good plate mount for a utility trailer I purchased and this plate mount was easy to install and is sturdy. Will hold up over time and that was what I was looking for.
B0006IX7YC|4|The swivel stick operated like a charm.  I ran water through the hose for about 5 minutes and the tank ran clean.  I did fill the tank again and used the swivel stick again to make sure.  The water ran extremely clear from the black water tank.  The connection from the tool to the hose leaked a little, but not enough to make me not like this tool.
B001GJ3FIS|5|Good
B002798Y0A|5|Perfect fit nothing needed to do to it.
B00RZ4W60G|4|Easy to mount and room to hook up, without getting hooked
B00L1S6PQS|5|Awesome!!!
B000FPY7JK|5|Fixed my loose steering !
B00FC22JU0|5|I originally purchased about 4 months ago.  GREAT quality in lights compared to the stock bulbs on my 2002 4runner.  Ez to install.  Minor issue is that you have to make a larger hole on the dust cover ( I used duct tape to minimize debris entering the unit).  One light started to go out after running for a few minutes after about 5,000 miles.  I contacted Innovited.  I thought it was probably the ballast since the light bulb would work again later.  I changed the ballast - same problem.  They recommended to switch the light bulbs.  This test indicated that the bulb was defective.  They quickly sent out a replacement.  I asked them if they would mind sending a whole pair just in case this were to happen again and they gladly sent out a pair.  HIGHLY recommend these.  I am grateful they replaced the bulbs since it had only been 5,000 miles.  Probably would be a good idea to buy a backup set of bulbs when you buy the kit.  Considering the cost of the kit is around $60 it is well worth the price.  I bought a backup pair of bulbs for around $20.    Addendum:  In fairness to Innovited, my Toyota 2002 4Runner has DRL lights ( i.e. continuously on during the day).  That probably has accelerated them wearing out after around 8,000 miles.  My other light just started to act the same as the other.  Even though the traditional lights may last longer, I would still do it all over again.  I just figured out how to disable the DRL lights tonight (http://www.yotatech.com/f127/2002-4runner-drl-disable-off-capability-87596/).  Very easy to do - 1 clip of a wire and done. For $20/year for replacement lights, I would gladly do it for the quality of lights you get.
B000IZ3OLE|5|Great horn. Sound is exactly as original horn. However, the connectors are not plug n play. They are different than my 07 tahoe. But if you know how to hard wire them, they're a great replacement.
B002M4C6AO|5|Fit our 03 Dodge Neon SE perfect. They added a nice look to the car and now we can actually see at night!
B00BC26KR2|4|All functions appear to be working - hope it last like the original.
B000BUTDCA|5|Just what I needed.
B00KCY93VQ|5|Perfect. Strong magnet. Long lasting battery.
B00GJXM0DC|5|Excellent product. Thanks!
B00GI4P6DS|5|this is an interesting approach...  lots of pros:<br />- the hollow center in effect makes each socket BOTH a standard and deep... as long as you have rotational access to the ase nut, you are golden.. great invention that I wish I had 30 years ago<br />- because of this, you are getting double the sockets, eg aout 160 sockets for $85 and you cant eat that anywhere<br />- the socket pattern grabs great and is very impressive<br />- with this one set you get a HUGE range.... 4mm to 25mm deep and shallow, 5/32 to 1&#34; deep and shallow...  roughly the equivalent of 160 sockets for $85.... wow<br />- us older guya appreciate the easy to read socket labeling<br />- it will drive other standard 1/4 and 3/8 adapters so you can still use your old sockets and extensions if necessary<br /><br />if you've been a line mechanic for any length of time , you will appreciate these big time and wonder why you ever wasted so much money on snap on<br /><br />- the whole thing screamzs high quality at a very VERY low price...  $85 at Sears.com and hopefully here too soon as I complained about the price difference
B00CIXAQYC|5|Bolted right up and the instructions were perfect for my Odyssey.
B005ZWM0R4|5|worked fine as expected
B00HV2KMPS|1|Did not yuse auto mechanic recommended different kit
B00IPNPA3G|3|They need to pack the two pieces better.  I had some scraches on mine. Lucky for me there on the back side where you can't see them all the time
B00XPL88NC|5|Every other tire gauge I have ever used has a straight bar type with a sliding measure that blows out the bottom to show the pressure. This gauge by TireTek is a lot different and brings more features to the table than those simpler gauges.<br /><br />First things first - this gauge is much, much larger than any other I have used with the sole exception of one built into an air compressor. The entire (no pun intended) assembly is over a foot long and it has a huge dial gauge on the end. The dial is encased in rubber and this serves two purposes - it protects the dial and it makes the dial assembly look a bit more like a tire.<br /><br />The dial is very easy to read and it gives a clear reading accurate to within 1 PSI. The range goes from 0 PSI up to 60 PSI in graduations of one. There’s no rocket science here.<br /><br />Where this gauge adds more is in the pressure release button which you press and hold to slowly release some air from the tire. As you hold it down and the air escapes, the pressure dial slowly drops to show the current pressure so you can stop at any point you like.<br /><br />I like that fact that even though the joint near the dial is somewhat loose and the unit can be turned about it does not leak air.<br /><br />This is a well-made gauge. The hose and casing are heavy rubber and will resist most simple cuts and scuffs, and when it is stored properly the rubber should not degrade. The dial is heavy and though it has a plastic face it is solid and can survive a decent drop. The joints between the hose and the metal connector fittings do not leak which is good for maintaining accuracy.<br /><br />This is a great tire gauge. It’s a solid unit, easy to use and easy to read. It works a lot better than the slider types, too.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.ely on my experience with it.
B006X8BR0K|5|Excelent you will love it. F250 5.4L 2001 fix perfect looks good and good quality
B004A6NB6A|1|did not fit properly and thickness is incorrect. paper is very cheap made.
B00229IMDY|5|These are awesome. Same size as a bumper sticker. I placed one in the right rear window of a full size truck. The sticker is extremely visible and can be seen for about 10 car lengths plus. I will be placing this on the SUV as well. If you want something with outstanding visibility and giving other drivers a warning. This is what you need.
B000ALJ4NS|5|As expected, it is holding my mirror in place. Good product and quick to set.
B001N1E9Y8|5|Brought these for my my husband as a gift and he loves it. ...great product for is its price so far he has only used small one and it has been 8 months of daily use and still going strong.
B00FSBE79G|4|This tent seems to be well built and was fairly easy to set up (once i figured out which way was which) It is also extremely small when bagged up, could fit it behind the driver seat no problem. Sadly the model 110760 just isn't a good fit on my '96 toyota t100 extra cab, the length is perfect but because the tent is designed to go around the outside of the car, it is too tight between the tail lights which causes the door to be nearly impossible to close. I'm also afraid that it would end up ripping after a few uses from being over stretched. I will be returning it tomorrow and trying something else.<br /><br />My advice would be to read other reviews and make sure it fits well on your truck before purchasing, unfortunately for me though, the design just won't work for my t100.
B0002T8GKA|5|Love this product. Didn't  think i would ever find this product again
B00D2AXKY8|4|It was what i wanted
B000C7ZVPK|5|This fit the plug on my cooling fan relay but the pins are a different layout on my connector. I don't know which is wrong and I can make it work by buying a new plug but that's not what I wanted to do. I'm not blaming the seller because it's suppose to be the right part number for a 1984 Corvette. My original relay is 10032081. According to Rock Auto that is suppose to be for an 85 Vette. So maybe somebody changed my car along the way or maybe everyone else is wrong. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was my fault.
B009DIWO2M|4|Knock off K&N, not bad for the money!

Just be sure to take it off before going to church. This is not going to be for everyone, but those who have a good sense of humor. The magnet has a good grip to my metal surfaces that I put it on. At 5x5 inches it’s a good size that’s not too small or big. The finish is slightly glossy and have no doubt will hold up in the rain and winter. I just wish the bundled 3 pack was less in price since I don’t have 3 cars. Overall a great product for anyone with a baby. Please note I did receive a discount in exchange for my honest feedback that had no impact in my review or ratings.
B005OKCKAE|4|Got the front and rear emblem seven months ago. Haven't out either one on the car yet because my husband said that he will have to remove the entire front clip on our Equinox just to install the front emblem. I didn't want the back to be black and not the front so I had him wait to switch. They have sat in our closet since purchase. They do look as pictures and seemed to be good quality though.
B0083SL82A|1|Came in damaged and the box was fine.
B008B0TRAA|5|fit and works great
B0079SJ0B6|2|After owning these lights for about 8 months, one light has already failed.  I also noticed an issue with the Litronic lights were not self adjusting with these bulbs installed.  It wasn't until I had the vehicle serviced by the dealership that we determined that the LED lights were the cause of the Litronics not auto adjusting when first lit.  Would not recommend these bulbs for a 2002 996 Porsche with Litronic lights.
B0067UJKHQ|5|Fixed my dodge avenger idle problems. No more stalling at stop lights.
B00LCASS6K|4|Although, I had to order these again and pay more I was happy with what I finally received. Just as good as the OE version great replacements. Mine started to leak after about 9 years of life. I might now order the stability arms and install them next just to help with the road bumps.<br /><br />First, remove the compressor fuse or disconnect battery but if you like your vehicles settings you might try to find the fuse instead. Next, raise the truck up than drain the air out of the lines by lowering the compressor (hardest part). Since, you only lower the compressor to get the air out of the lines than have to reinstall it back to its original mounting spot. Once all the air is out of the lines the air bags get soft and are easy to remove. Just make sure to push on the air hose nut like object with a regular/flat head screw driver and easily pull out on the line at the same time not to damage the reseeding air line. Since, you will be reinserting it into the new air bags once installed. Installing the new air bags should be easier than removing the old ones out due to them not being fully extended. After installing new bags just very lightly lower the back end of the jack stands but not all the way just until they get close to making contact. I went back under just to make sure the bottom of the bags were locking into the correct placement. Once, I made sure they were both lining up I started lowering them the rest of the way but not until I reinstalled the fuse and started up the truck. Just to make sure the compressor was working correctly and the bags were filling up.<br /><br />Everything is great on my truck now although I did notice the compressor coming on more frequently at stops now. Although, my vehicle isn't nearly sitting on its tires after sitting over night any more either. So, it coming on here and there is a lot better than needing 45 to 60 seconds of air in the morning. I still might have a O ring leak near the compressor since I checked for that but all the weight was off of the vehicle at the time...not the best time to check for it. Anyways very happy with these replacements. Half a days of work saved me over $450 by ordering the parts and doing the work myself.<br /><br />(Update 8-21-15) Well, now today I received a message asking me to change my seller review. Anyone, else that had experienced what I did would've given them negative feedback and probably wouldn't have re-ordered from the same company. I did however and the second order was correct therefore I assumed fair feedback to be deserving. Yet, now that I get an email to change it really makes me question the company's legitimacy. Those who gave 1 star product reviews might be on to something as well and who knows maybe these replacements aren't going to be great replacements after all.
B00TDDCGNO|5|select a warm white temperature  to match the original bulbs.. Works great, but not as bright as filament bulbs.
B00HE6738A|5|Had to break to open. Used 2 channel licks to finally break cap loose. But, then found brush & matched my '93 Silverado fairly good.
B003E6J94U|5|The hitch fit perfectly and works great on my 2002 400EX.
B001BWCG6M|5|Fit perfect on my cobra drive. Nice cheap solution for trailering and protecting the hydraulics.
B00265FXTA|5|OEM replacement for my 2002 Audi A4 with the HID headlight package. Great price, fits perfect and not that difficult to change. Many may be looking for a whiter or more blue color headlight, but this is what was intended for these cars. Also, although blue/white looks great, higher temperature bulbs do not provide as much light per watt as lower temperature bulbs like this one.<br /><br />If your headlight is not working and a new bulb does not fix it, the problem may be with the balast - If you are good with your hands Chrystler has an equivalent balast with different plug layout for far less than Audi/VW replacements. Instructions are available online for how to retrofit your plug to use these more affordable balasts (which were available on Amazon last i checked)
B000KL3DSU|5|Works perfect
B000CB1O16|1|I just got this part<br />I'm not impressed at all<br />The part look real cheap looks like is a refurbishe part not a brand new part for sure look way different at the website<br />I think I'm going to return it and just go to my local auto parts and order it.
B007GLCO3W|4|Convenient to use.
B0041LN1L4|5|NEEDED IT
B0038F8SYE|5|Easy to set up and great usage. I love the wheels while I work on the cars.
B00L8TA2T6|5|These lights are bad ass ....I taped the lens and spray ed with black bedliner so it's rain proof .... Just incase......I love them.....Will buymore.....thanks .  AAA+++++
B00YJJ4AUO|3|Fit was a little extra work, but in the end was able to make it work.  Otherwise good.
B000C0TBAS|1|This item created havoc in my engine, the belt literally shredded and twisted up in my pulls and alternator causing me to purchase a new one. I would run from this product..
B00N2K6M2A|2|Not happy! Don't get me wrong it does work but it is not what was advertized.
B00G8PFLHS|5|Perfect
B00NI73NUG|5|They are reall nice on my 07 Pony. Fits great!
B00J2BNKTG|5|Very pleased
B0072UPAQK|4|These steps look awesome, the only issues I have with these bars is that they leave the front end of the bars open, but seal the back end. It boggles my mind why they would just leave it open like that. Secondly, nowhere in the any of the descriptions here or on the manufacturer website does it say anything about drilling a hole for the middle bracket, not to mention it was physically impossible to drill that hole anyway because of such a short distance from the frame to where the hole needed to be. But overall I really do love these steps.
B009FNWFRY|4|These look pretty sweet on my Gold trailblazer.  They are very sturdy.  Easy instructions.  My trailblazer (2006) was very rusted on the chassis and the pre-drilled holes on the frame were very difficult to thread as they were well rusted.  I didn't want to tap them out so I just bought some shorter mounting bolts because they were tough to screw in.  Very good quality I would recommend to anyone who wants to add a very stylish accessory with good functionality as well.
B00877SL2M|3|I bought four packages, 40, and so far have used 6 of which one was bad.  Be careful, they are polarity sensitive but the packaging does not indicate that.
B0080DFZJK|5|Very pleased
B00U90CQHQ|5|These make my lifted F250 stand out even more!😎
B00Y5H8A7Y|3|It's loud, but definitely needs a bass horn to make it sound better. And I didn't need the extra wire harness and relay that were recommended. So I wasted money on the recommendation of the website.
B000CFS74E|5|Just like advertised!!  Easy to install with noticeable power to engine and nice engine growl. Great product!
B00AYH6BSO|5|Rock Solid Product and smaller the others I have seen.  Does everything I have thrown at it within the specs of the inverter.  Also has a lower standby power consumption then most.<br /><br />UPDATE, I have been using this continuously for 2 years and still running strong.
B00BUS5BGO|5|Works great. Fits our 2014 Forester perfectly.  Hides the items in the back of the car and also gives a finished look to the interior.
B000B8LKSW|5|This is made out of rugged plastic.  It fits my 2000 jeep Cherokee sport perfectly and does not have the annoying and faulty ratcheting mechanism present in the original oil cap.
B008O1N1JE|4|i'm satisfied to be use at a later date....thank you
B006WQ9SYU|5|Really helps keep from scratching the paint putting luggage in or taking it out of thr trunk.
B007CLM2JM|1|Awful. Install was a pain but that's with everything aftermarket. I bought 8000k and received what I think was 6000k. Bulbs lit up perfectly with key in ignition. The second I turn the key to start up the engine they either flickered and cut off or just didn't start whatsoever. I'm very displeased with the product. Could have just used the money for a more reliable set of HIDs. Unfortunately my car is 2015. So it could be that the HIDs were not ready for it however when Amazon gave me the option to see if this products fits my car it claimed to say it would work. Id like to give this product the benefit of doubt but for going on day two of installment without any progress on getting them to light and stay lit with the car on, I'm not so sure.
B00JVI00CU|4|Nice but the manufacture box was banged up & it came with some scratches.
B000C2MAHW|5|the right part
B000C947DU|5|I`m pleased!
B00CT30SSU|5|Fit my 2015 Subaru WRX perfectly and matched the OEM unit perfectly. The stock filter was surprisingly dirty after just 1 year / 13k mi. Will be adding this to my list of items to replace every 6 months.  Much cheaper alternative than OEM. Don't let the dealer charge their ridiculous fees for swapping this out for you. This takes under 10 minutes and requires no tools or acrobatics- the hardest part is emptying out your glove compartment (which isn't hard).
B00029KC2K|2|Packaging is great - easy open plastic. Wish more products would come this way. The problem is over time,say about 1 year, the reflecting material starts to seperate from the adhesive backing and becomes unsightly. The adhesive must be very good as its a bear to remove!
B0045LJU2E|5|Works as expected.
B005HMNJDG|5|Great product and easy to install!
B00K8VQE7Y|3|Like it very much! The only issue that I have and it is an annoying one is that the picture is starting to come off. It leaves a mess on my dash, seat and does not look good anymore. I recommend putting clear packing tape over it. This will more than likely prevent this issue.
B0074WPKAC|2|While it was working, it was good. it would move a lot but it was fine. Until it died, which didn't take very long. Less 3 months! I cannot recomment something that doesn't last!
B00D9E3GTG|4|everything as advertised, used it on 2 picnics no complaints
B0054RW2BO|4|Only on to this order, but it's good looking mirror! I thought, at first, it was going to look dorky hanging off the side like that, but the black color makes it blend in nicely. Easy to install. The mirror was tough to adjust at first. I had to loosen some screws to get it to move, but it moved eventually, and I tightened it back up.
B000C8ZEII|5|Bought this even though it's not meant for my 1987 Mercury Colony Park. I cut the end off and elbowed out the side. Works great.
B00MA7744G|1|First day a 12 bulbs went out
B000FQ7NV8|5|Added a nice, updated look to my 01 TJ. Really easy to install.
B000FG4C6W|5|Love it
B00E6V7CY6|5|Better the what I expected  very happy I purchase this item
B001C5QB96|5|dog loves it
B00KGER79C|4|works but had to learn how to do it
B01092I9LA|5|Nice
B003FBV8ZW|5|I love these glasses.  I wear them as my day to day sunglasses and riding motorcycles.  I even wear them as safety goggles.
B002V9A4MW|4|The gasket was what I needed. I've installed many of these on rover engines, this one did have the correct size holes for the locating plugs, most other gaskets the holes are too small. However I gave this four stars because it arrived bent up pretty bad, I was able to tap it down as flat as possible and try it, so far it seems OK. But it would have been nice it arrived flat. It was against a cardboard in plastic then came in a separate box, even after all that it was still bent.
B00651C6L4|3|Returned my stubby antenna for this one due to no reception. It's a cool little antenna from the distance.<br /><br /> However it bends in the wind which I'm afraid will eventually snap off. Reception is also alright but not great. Finally the material is somewhat cheap but hey you get what you pay for.
B0031HI0HY|4|So far so good. I have had these in for about 4-5 months now and they are still burning bright!
B00SS8JRT6|5|Good by golley! Just the right size, will buy more for others Too.
B0042Z0XWY|5|Looks great on my vehicle and to my surprise it came with a little wrench keychain to tighten them up.  Now I am just worried of people taking them!
B005TMIY0W|3|Not enough double sided tape I had to go hd to buy more.
B009DJL490|5|fit 98 beetle 2.0<br />Seems to work fine.
B002E323DS|5|Great part fixed the problem. Fit like a glove.
B00M9MHBCW|5|Used for 2014 Honda CRF 125 Big Wheel. Looks and sounds much better.<br />-will post photos later (and possibly video for proof)
B00W1VIJ5E|4|Everything good, only the size is a bit too small for an XL...
B001IS88TS|5|Love this ramp!!!!! Shipping was fast! Will be ordering from this seller again! Thanks!
B0046YMYCS|5|awesome look and safety accessery
B0096B9JXS|5|Worked
B00SH1AI2O|2|Looks nice, but its way overpriced and its not &#34;memory foam&#34; you could do better with a folded towel. I used it for 7 days and its limp and doesn't provide any cushion, the foam is very cheap.
B006O0EZR4|2|NO RUBBER GROMETS WITH NEW SHOCK . NOT A GOOD DEAL
B00ONH1I2K|5|Awesome delivery, everything and more than I was looking for.
B00AKVI1R8|4|The product was OK, but the adhesive was not the best. Ended up using Velcro to hold it in place during rough terrain or running over pot holes.
B005QEA6V8|1|Broke first time it was used
B00152M2H6|1|At first use, the cap for the soap dispenser is a terrible design. It sits flat and for someone like me, that has no fingernails, it's a challenge to remove. Once removed, be warned, the car wash soap must be thin as water in order for the pump to work...the only problem with it being that watered down, it leaks everywhere, and it's dispensing action is sporadic at best. I ended up just putting soap in a bucket and using the soapjet as a water nozzle...and awfully expensive one at that. IMO, it was a total waste of money...another great idea only ruined by cheap engineering and quick design...
B001ROUMH4|5|Product exactly as described. No complaints. Happy with my purchase.
B001DKSNI2|1|Cheap product. Came shipped cracked and would not have lasted even if shipped intact. Returned without a problem so I can't complain but steer clear of this product.
B00K7X8J6W|4|I definitely LIKE this...i wouldn't say LOVE IT. Having in on for a day and really given it a &#34;test&#34; has helped with this conclusion.<br />My hands, at times, tend to get sweaty on the cover, they never did on my car wheel. So thats really the only reason i dont LOVE it, but thats it.<br /><br />I tried putting this on my MOMO Subaru wheel for my 2004 WRX the first second i got it and let me tell you, the recommendations of letting the wheel cover heat up a little is completely on point. It wouldn't fit at all and i began to wonder if it was the wrong size...so the next day, i left it in my car on a hot day, front seat, just to loosen things up a bit and then boom, it fit...not like a glove (which is a good thing) eventually it did fit like a glove once around the wheel though - i had to maneuver it a little to get over the wheel but once on, it was a snug fit!<br /><br />Definitely love the feel of this compared to my flaking manufactured wheel (i guess thats what happens to a wheel after its been used for 11 years).<br /><br />End results: Great cover, comfortable, easy to put on once you let it expand a little from the heat, only downfall is that your hands may sweat (key word is MAY) so thats really dependent on your outside temperature/humidity.
B0023VDICQ|5|It's ok
B004AU3HT2|5|Very pleased
B00Z2R1OJM|5|I can finally get rid of a few of the little drill bit cases that I hate using. I just got one, but I'll be using these to reach free shipping for a couple future orders. 5/5 will buy again
B003APRYV0|3|I didn't realize that the decal would be so shiny.  I have it on a very flat painted wall. I would have preferred the option to pick a flat decal as well.  Other than that it looks good.
B007Y0ALTY|5|I haven't used it on the street yet but Iam happy with the look and feel of it.
B00AYH6CQU|5|Came quickly and works just as advertised.  Love the led's that tell you if it is on or in a fault condition.
B000LN5AHE|5|the best !
B00ASCOFRY|1|Returned it and waiting for refund.
B00UMQ5P8O|2|Only had it a short time already fading very disappointed for the price you pay
B00KWGU71Y|4|Shipped promptly, fits snug. Good value for the money.
B00W47NSYM|3|I like the color of the tape as it was perfect for our couch. Unfortunately, you can tell where you cut it, as it shows the white trim, and after sitting a few times the tape tends to pull up. We'll use up the roll for now, but I'll have to stay on the lookout for something else.
B000AM8BLI|5|There bulbs what more can you say
B00M32ZCEM|5|Couldn't have asked for a better product. Yes, these are expensive, yes the install is time consuming. If you can look past both of those common &#34;concerns&#34; you have a great set of steps that work as intended. It's also great when you pull up somewhere and get out and everyone starts looking under your truck to see how they work, both men and women!
B000BL1106|5|Good part, fast delivery, nice price.  Fit like original.
B009FUF6DM|5|Awesome.  I use as rags and wash cloths for the cars trucks and RV.  I even used as wash cloth in the shower and noticed it was far less harsh on my skin than a regular face cloth.  I stuff in my hockey skates to help dry them out and use to wipe down the blades.  Very satisfied.<br />In the washer machine, and they come out clean looking pretty
B000OUW7Q6|5|You can't use a Gravity Feed Spray Gun without it. I made a small wood stand for mine so I could move it around.
B00JR33MYW|5|Fit trailer to a tee
B00UW4DLJ6|5|Excellent, the case and all the additional attachments for charging were very unexpected. Very pleased!
B000C30JDI|5|Took about 10 minutes to put this on my 1999 Dodge RAM 2500 Diesel Extended Cab - Long Bed. I've driven over 6,000 miles since I put it on and it is quiet and works perfectly. My original OEM belt came off at 178,480 miles and I'm now at 184520. I hope this belt lasts as long as the Mopar OEM did. ;-)<br />By the way... took my truck to Cummins (not a Dodge stealer) and had them check the engine out. I wanted a tune-up. The guy said: &#34;Are you nuts? You've only got 178 thousand miles on it. You don't need a tune-up till you get 350,000 miles. I'll change the fuel filter.&#34; Wow! That's when I decided to keep my excellent 16 year old truck. I had it professionally painted the original color.. put on new front and rear bumpers and grille, new Euro style headlights and taillights, new lifts for the Tonneau cover, refurbished original upholstery, and a couple of new RAM badges. She's beautiful, powerful, and looks and drives like new. Best of all? She's 16 years old and paid for 14  years ago.
B000CLYVOI|2|This part is not a Manufacturer's spec replacement. When I tried to install it the screw holes and plastic rain cover didn't line up. Waste of time!
B00PZQHUF2|5|Great product
B00HHPBF46|5|Works perfectly with the newer Ducati plugs. Just plug in one end to your motorycycle, and the other end to you battery tender. No need to buy the Ducati-specific trickle charger. Build quality is very good, looks like it's stock and came with the bike. Thanks OptiMate for making this product, I have multiple battery tenders, this simple plug allows me to use what I already have.
B00XM1GKJY|5|Arrived in two days, awesome!
B008R0L6XA|5|Allowed me to set up my Sena in another helmet at a great price.
B0093N67CU|5|These Hog ring pliers do the job and hold the rings well.
B000CB7E10|4|its a fuel filter, what else can you say?
B00N418CHA|1|Wasn't satisfied with the part cause they break to easily I have had two and both of them broke so I compared them to my original part and notice that they not as thick as they should be
B000CQOIVO|3|Ok for light duty trailers
B001J7K2VK|3|They tend to dry out in the sun if you have it on your dashboard so the only way it'll hold anything is if you lay it flat & even then my cell sometimes still falls on the floor.
B004VPX1TM|5|Fits my 2015 Mk7 GTI perfectly.<br />Initially thought it didn't fit but I had the glassy part inserted - which was wrong side in.<br />Once inserted correctly, a slight push to further get it down as close as the original 12V cap's protrusion height.<br />Twisting it while inserted also makes it lit as it's being charged.<br /><br />Else taking it out serves as mini portable flash light.<br />Also, can stick it in the 12V in the trunk for addl. trunk lighting.<br /><br />.
B003KTPN96|5|Good quality and perfect fit
B001U0G0GW|4|I've had this bag for about 4 years now, and it sees a lot of use during my motorcycle camping trips.  It has a TON of room for bike campers like myself.  Inside it,  I can fit my eureka spitfire 2 tent, inflatable thermarest sleeping pad, thermrest compressible pillow, camp axe, and collapsible fishing rod/tackle in the main compartment.  The side access to the main compartment (both sides have this) is extremely handy so you don't have to pull all of your crap out to get to one specific item. The tanker roll on the top has enough room to keep my US Army summer weight patrol sleeping bag and Gortex bivy sack inside no problem. I use the back &#34;flap pouches&#34; for smaller items like camp cookware, tools, power cables, etc. The side flap pouches are not very big and really only hold a few bags of trail mix, pocket knives, or smaller things like that.  All in all, between this bag and the hard saddlebags on my Harley, I can haul all of my of necessary gear and a lot of creature comforts as well.  All material have held up well, but the black coloring/dye did fade fast with all the miles and hours in the sun, but that's to be expected.  Stitching is very stout and shows no signs of wearing down or any defect.  The &#34;chrome plating&#34; on the buckles does look like smacked a** though, and was the first thing to lose its luster. Corrosion and pitting appeared almost immediately after just the first season of use.  Zippers are quite strong and stay on their track even when you are trying to shove too much stuff in there!  The sinch straps and clip buckles are working great with no defects even after I really hunker down and crank them tight to ensure the bag doesnt fly off the bike; so no issues there.  The little adjustable &#34;sleeve&#34; that fits over your passenger back rest pad (if you choose to use that feature...however it's not necessary), will only fit very small backpads.  It doesn't even come close to fitting over my '03 Electra Glide back rest pad,but it does fit great over my smaller, retro 1985 FXRS Low Glide passenger back rest pad.  Overall, I am satisfied with this luggage bag, and would highly recomend it to my friends.  With a little tweaking of a few minor features, this bag would be king! If you are considering buying this bag, just do it already!
B00MGXE528|5|Love it!
B002Z64P4Y|5|Fit 2012 Big<br /><br />Country
B00M3H24UC|5|The radios are working very well and definitely serve the purpose of communication between the driver and spotter. Well worth the money.
B001LQ0QBA|5|Product was delivered quickly, and looks to be a much better product than the original ACDelco rotos that came on the car.
B0006MRQXG|5|Nice quality, light weight, does the job
B009GX90P8|5|Very nice helmet for the price... but doesn't fit into the seat compartment....
B009T9BW5U|5|Perfect fix to those crazy 2 piece handlebars Harley screwed you with from the factory.  now you have endless options for new bars.
B006VFR3C6|4|It's a nice replacement knob.  Fit is slightly loose before the set screw is tightened.  I wish it was little more snug around the shaft, Beavis.  I used a combination of a small amount of epoxy and the set screw to hold it in place.  Looks good and solid feel.
B006571Q5A|5|Installed this on the kick starter of my Cushman Husky engine that is in my '58 Bliss Surrey.  The Bliss is a reproduction of a 1903 Curved Dash Oldsmobile.  The meter works well and seems to accurately keep track of the time the engine is running.  A good value and fast delivery.
B00CFNMBDY|3|shipping took over 6 weeks!!! What? But once it finally arrived it was exactly what I needed and save me a lot of money replacing my shifter
B00BZAGGTI|5|Installed the new battery, turned the key, pressed the starter, and it has been perfect since.
B000IEF61G|5|The floor mats and steering wheel cover are great! Came very fast too. Looks great in my car!
B007QV1RLM|5|Works great.
B0039Z3SRA|5|Keeps speaker's protected from the elements and keeps the sound in the car, any speaker's sound better in these.
B00H9S71LW|5|Works just as good as the MX. Awesome product. Works flawlessly with Torque Pro app on app store. Accurate readings with near instant updating for all PIDs. Would definitely buy another, always reccomend to friends and strangers.
B0006GF5SK|5|I'm a professional yacht captain. I use these little paks once a month to keep the vessels head system working perfectly. They also block out the smell all boats get from when the holding tank is full. You know what I'm talking about. Great Stuff!
B00559VN6G|5|really good product!
B004V71ENK|4|great parts heavy duty parts, the shipping was a little slow, that's why I gave it a four star rating
B000WJ0RK2|5|Gift for my girlfriend who is a hello kitty fan and she loves the mats.
B001G62AAU|5|Good
B00DQGAU00|5|Perfect replacement for a relay my used truck was missing when i bought it. Kept getting a code on my 2006 silverado finally figured out that someone took a relay out of the fuse box, code went away quickly once installed!
B00MB0EX46|2|This item would have been great if it actually came the way it did in the picture. The picture show it to have 4 sections to screw in the frame. It only comes with the top two which I know isn't a big deal but it's still not what I was wanting for my car.
B00G3U2ZS6|1|Turns out it was actually the starter that was messed up, but with the new Cam sensor and new starter it still wouldn't work. Once I put in the old sensor it started right up. This sensor doesn't sit right in the slot, it tightens down at an odd angle that doesn't allow it to make contact.
9539752337|5|Great
B009IK9P18|5|a couple of bucks for great mirrors. you can even move the mirror around inside the housing
B0000AYES4|5|Simple and easy to use
B00JXAPET0|5|Extremely happy with the quality and ease of installation of the HID kit. It was less than 20 minutes to install! And the price was less than a set of premium halogen headlights!
B004GE9TDU|5|Quick shipping and great price. Very pleased how a simple repair makes the family ride look whole again.
B00JA393Y2|3|These wipers are supposed to replace the Super Sporza Silicone blades.  I could immediately tell that these are not nearly as good.  Bummed!
B00E0IJYQY|5|This kit was right on par, easy to install on my 2005 honda cbr600rr  and made a huge difference with overall handling of the bike , very smooth on acceleration and deceleration
B00CRT8M2A|4|Comfortable and fit well especially if you have a bigger head.
B00M78820I|5|Received and really like! It's over 100 degrees this time of year and my leather interior can take quite a beating!  The shade fits the windshield of my Chevy Tahoe very well. I love the instructions too! I've never been able to fold those things and now I'm an old pro :)  Happy to support a small business as well!!
B001DKM3SI|4|Could use a little more bristles for my taste, but good product.
B000R308RA|1|Looked great for the 2 weeks it worked
B00PBENGUG|3|Doesn't stay on seat
B00OX5GSRW|5|The original mirror on my 2004 Suburban had somehow broken internally and it looked like brown liquid was floating around inside of it. The view through the mirror was very blurry.<br /><br />This part looks exactly like my other one did when it was new and I was able to switch them out without any trouble in about 5 minutes. I love how the mirror looks now. This is a cheaper option than replacing the whole mirror assembly or getting it from the dealer.
B00T05KZAG|5|Great to have
B0087NB23Q|4|Work as advertised, we actually have the intercom running on the whole trip which take 4 hour each stop... No mistake! Sharing music from 1 phone to partner on a trip is a great experience. Only need to charge the battery if you go all day. Greqt buy!
B01093Q9BQ|5|I keep one in my office and one in my car. They save me $$$ in Advil I'd be taking if I didn't have these. I went out of town and forgot to pack one to bring with me and paid for it after a gew hours at the computer. I'm buying a third - cheap at half the price - to keep in my suit case so that doesn't happen again!
B00L1TX042|5|Perfect
B000IYZNFK|5|No problems
B00065T0E6|4|It's just OK, because it was cheap. I have a set of Craftsman wrenches and I lost the 5/8.  This one says craftsman and one side looks exactly like the set I have so I assumed it was a real Craftsman.  It is not or at least it's not a &#34;Forged in USA&#34; Craftsman.  Like I said, it looks like the set I have on one side but the other side where a real Craftsman would say &#34;Forged in USA&#34; it does not. So it's either a knock off or Craftsman has a line of wrenches that are made outside the US, which would be very disappointing to me.  Anyway it works and fits with the set I have so hopefully it won't break when I need it the most. (knock,knock,knock)<br /><br />Amended review. 8/21/2015<br />I received an email form the seller in response to my review. Contents quoted below:<br /><br />&#34; Thank you for your purchase of the Craftsman 9-44697 5/8 12 Point Combination Wrench. I received your product feedback. For about a decade, a large and increasing number of Craftsman tools are made in China. Snap-on is the only major brand that is produced exclusively in the U.S. The wrench that received was produced in China, as are most Craftsman wrenches. If the wrench breaks (I have never seen one break), it can be returned to a Craftsman retailer for a free replacement, as Craftsman still has a lifetime warranty on all of their hand tools.<br /><br />I appreciate your feedback. Your product review will be useful to future customers who are looking for a product made in the U.S. However, I would request that you remove the feedback left for me personally, as the product description did not indicate that the wrench was made in the U.S.<br /><br />Thank you, &#34;<br /><br />Thanks to the seller for clearing this up.  Still disappointed that Craftsman would let their products be made in China but I can't blame the seller for that.  + 1 star.  I'll add the 5th star if the seller puts this information in the product description.
B00944TD1U|5|Minds I body are awesome and they have a great service team to make sure u are satisfied
B009II5CMQ|4|I bought this recently to replace the battery in my Chamberlain garage door opener (battery is for backup during power outages).<br />It works well, but if you are looking to purchase this unit as a replacement make sure you check the size against your current battery.  This unit is slightly larger than my old battery, which I didn't realize until I tried to install it in the opener and it didn't fit.  Not anyone's fault but my own.
B007FNDAGG|5|Item went over top the lower mid front bumper with no issues. Looks good.
B003FVFV46|5|I bought these for my boyfriends jeep grand Cherokee. They look great in his car and fit perfectly. He had no problems putting them on as each piece is separate. No needing to try and stretch them beyond their means. They definitely help in the summer so my legs and arms don't get burnt by hot leather.<br /><br />My pack came with 2. I will be giving the other set to his friend.
B00WYI9XMC|5|I purchase a Hawk Bluetooth helmet and went 3300 miles. Helmet works great and sound is clear! Volume is high enough to hear music even in a storm with high winds. Love my Hawk Helmet!!!!
B00H88E5H6|5|Looks better than the real thing.  Easy on.
B0082365AQ|1|Strongly considered returning it. Product arrived with one tube damaged and had to replace it. Very flimsy, have had to reinforce it to keep it from collapsing constantly.  Concept in general is good but needed work to make it functional.[[ASIN:B0082365AQ TMS CART-CANOE/KAYAK-KY001 New Jon Boat Kayak Canoe Carrier Dolly Trailer Tote Trolley Transport Cart Wheel]]
B0042Z0E6E|5|We were very pleased with this purchase and plan to order another 9x18 as well as a 9x12 for our screen house. We have an Artic Fox camper so it is very heavy so having these lightweight outdoor rugs are wonderful for transportation. Easy to sweep off nice under bare feet.
B00VGL65HY|5|Works as advertised.  No issues yet.
B000GZVC7O|4|Fits tight, but does work!
B00OR87LXK|3|OK
B001AVU0JY|5|High quality direct replacement.
B00BPSUCPE|5|great product
B005G21EAC|5|the qwick load works great. saves lots of time,no more screwing around :0)..fair price
B00X04JRMU|5|I just tried this product for the first time. It is great and it is fast. I highly recommend this to everyone...I am 75 and it takes very little effort to apply or to buff.
B0009VIQ1A|1|Sent it back - left little red balls all over my car - this is the 3rd one I've ordered  - others worked awesome (use to dust furniture and walls) - will order another and hope it works....
B000WJC7Y6|4|Cosmotic defects
B00445PGX8|5|These are exceptional mat and I love them! What arrived is one long mat (instead of 2 seperate mats). I personally actually prefer this so I am giving them 5 stars.
B001CF3IX8|3|Fit great in my YJ, donknow what the fuss is all about. Easy install. Cup holders aren't the best like others have said, but they work great for holding my coffee mug on the commute to work, or just fast food drinks. Wouldn't put a drink there while off road as they will fall out. One small spot weld was broken, but in an area that was not imprtant. Very tough and secure unless thenthief uses a crow bar. I broke the little radio lip mount piece off on purpous with a hammer and screw driver in order to fit my Cobra 29 classic C.B radio and it works perfect.
B001P277B2|5|So easy a caveman can do it. Sounds great looks great. Definitely will refer this to anyone else that wants one. It's fits exactly like the old one but has a chrome top.
B008RQK7TI|4|I like the fact that they came with new bulbs. I did not like the fact that with about 2 weeks use one side is already leaking. They look great though and the price is amazing!
B008VLVDII|5|Fits well in my Ford Explorer and is a thick material. Wish it came in a cream color as well.
B00BLAG3D6|1|Wiring is crappy and the light isn't that bright works when it wants to. FIRE HAZARD!!!!  Called to complain and you can't talk to the ppl who made this light....
B000EDQR4Q|5|Purchased for use in our 5th wheel camper fridge.  Works well to keep things in tact while in transit!
B0055OHZ7M|5|Met my expectations. Good sound!
B00KTHVEFO|5|nice .. works fine.
B005DNB4QI|1|This oil filter is not for a 2015 Porsche Macan. The drain plug gasket and the O ring was wrong, the oil filter was overall smaller. Because I needed a filter and was pressed for time I used the filter but I reused my original gaskets and O ring.
B003WOZOUM|5|We traveled over 1500 miles through terrible rain and our stuff stayed completely dry.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B001GN6S8I|5|Fits.
B00F2NLNFG|5|Sounds great on my 2011 Tacoma!
B00GZKC36S|5|great
B000CHMLIK|1|Check engine light went on and had to buy an actual scion cap anyway
B00CXY32QA|5|Too easy to install & work great. No more getting hit in the back while getting something out of my trunk area.<br />2005 Dodge Magnum
B00W1VHNKG|5|Works great, looks great
B000BAT622|4|Works like I was expecting, would recommend it
B000B6CW0O|5|Fit perfectly. Performed better than expected. Fixed an annoying problem!
B00TKO0J6C|5|Just love these lights. I have a camper and the original ones stopped working, so I purchased these for more light in the bathroom. The led bulbs improved it a lot.
B000C9N0TM|4|Good fit, but threw my cumber off too much.  They had to drill new holes for the shocks to fix the cumber when I took it in for an alignment after installing them.  Good quality though.
B000BOAX1G|5|works fine.
B00OBWN30W|5|The part was an exact match and fit and shipped quickly.
B000CGM0LY|5|Be 110% sure which one you need BEFORE ordering. Part stores by me all stocked the fg0092 which is wrong for my 98 suburban that model has two plugs mine only had one. Double check before ordering. Pump works great
B000C9QDNM|5|Perfect
B009HVPV4S|4|Good
B00NGOWQAO|5|Perfect for my 84 BMW 325e

B003DMFDM2|5|Great rack and fit my husband's F150 great.  We use it a lot
B00029WYEY|5|very satisfied
B00KTHQR0Q|5|This item worked perfectly for a Dodge Ram 1500 pick up.....programming was easy with instructions from their website. Took less than a minute to program.
B009FQYDSA|5|Nice fit.
B00LPSOAX4|5|worked well for me
B00P9AB4OC|5|Really cute
B00GVHFCMW|5|Useful tool.
B003RF8VEC|5|Does its job very well!  My wife's tush is very thankful!!  :-)
B003S858QM|2|Not wide enough or long enough to help a lot in a rear end collision ®z
B00P9OF04I|5|Quick, easy and effective!
B001QIUGVI|5|Best bang for the buck.
B007TY6Y0K|5|Awesome Quality piece. Easy intall..2 wire plugs...Done !
B00GHS0BVW|5|good to 80%; the accessories given along did not fit perfectly; the DIY manual was good.
B001PYANNO|4|BOTH LINES FIT ,THEY ARE JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL  LINES,  WORKED GREAT!!!!!!
B00P73KWE4|5|Easy instillation on an '08 Arctic Cat 250.<br />About 25 minutes. I used blue threadlocker on all bolts, it seems like a very sturdy mount. Adds quite a bit of much needed storage area. Good value. Fast shipping.
B00ODQYN4Q|5|Switches were just as expected.
B0079QRRRM|4|Good design, Good quality.<br />Disadvantages:<br /> * Organizing of the space for placing office items like pens, wallets, note books, other small staff like memory sticks or small documents - not useful and wrong<br /> * Visor handler unuseful for my Shoei RF 1200 visor (model CWR-1) - shape is doesn't fit, some places of the visor unsafe<br /> * Mounting place for small bag did not provided if you do not use waist/chest belt of the backpack - it should be on the strap as well, it's 100% must be<br /> * This small additional bag is little bit small - it cannot take small wallet and key-chain with alarm trinket together. It should be a little bit bigger<br /><br />Advantages:<br /> * Very good overall shape - NO DRAG at all, even on 250+ kmph<br /> * You have enough cargo space<br /> * Looks very cool<br /> * Easy to IN and OUT<br /> * If it's not too loaded - it is not felt on the back<br /><br />Waiting for the next generation with improvements!
B00AHJYJBK|5|The product is just as I remember from days of old. The product was installed this morning and performs great.
B000GTTPTW|5|Easy to install and so far is holding up good.
B00UHD4HJA|1|These stickers SUCKED. Nothing at all like the pictures shown and it took over a month to get here
B009S5H6VE|4|Product as described
B00PT18QAQ|5|good product, very well made, and fast service.  very happy!
B008I7RQW2|2|I really didn't need this one, it's a manual and I wanted an automated one. I just ordered the wrong one so I paid for this lesson. It looks nice!
B00E6A6V8K|5|This Bob Marley sticker is awesome, looks great on my computer.
B00EUUNJRM|3|I installed this and it seems to function as described. The only issue is for the brackets. The brackets in the picture (with the teeth that keep it from slipping) are replaced with some el cheapo bent L shaped metal and the light bar moves when you hit a bump.
B008CLJ2MG|5|Arrived in excellent condition.; Very easy to put in.  Was exactly the same as the one I took out. That seldom is the case.
B004HAV94U|5|fits<br />don't like the 2 sided tape never had in channel vent visers with tape sticks before you get it all the way in
B009XA6L5Q|5|Fits fine, looks like OEM.
B00EDFM6R8|3|Not really warm white... more like bright white.
B00E9G1NES|5|The starter worked the first time and every time thereafter.  Excellent!!!!!
B00MB0EX46|4|Overall I am happy.
B00ZYUH5XG|5|Works for what I needed.
B007WISFC8|5|Good quality. Item was shipped quickly.
B00KTJ6D26|1|letters fade
B000E7YP7I|4|Very nice  Compact serves organization
B004A6JA2O|5|Works better than the original.
B009MAT1GI|5|Perfect fit, it keeps the sun out. Can't complain
B004RNR9QY|4|fittings are of good quality hose material I have seen better shipping was good price was good
B00LUYASSE|5|Awesome product
B00F5MUB66|5|Man, this thing rocks.  Totally blows the other shower head away.  Great purchase
B004MGKJ1I|5|People stop me to say GREAT BUMPER STICKER!
B004M2IKCW|1|I received the tie down and it will fit the truck and the hitch.  The only problem is that the Ribbed Neck Bolts that were sent with the tie downs are not long enough.  They don't match what the instructions say should be in the parts inventory.  Since the bolts are the wrong ones and they are special ribbed bolts, I cannot install the tie downs.
B0042HHZLY|5|Nice strong velcro for use with 4&#34; pads. I use Hex Logic pads with this backing plate. The molding is flexible, but not too much so and works well for everything I've use it on so far. For those who are new to machine polishing, the backing plate has a rubber cover over the threading, so take that off to attach it to your polisher...
B00CFSSX4A|5|Worked just fine and straightforward to install.
B00HNNQLZA|5|Great product for the money
B004SSDL8S|4|Small - like a glove compartment. Yet I have managed to fit a hat and sunglasses, an extra pair of gloves and a very carefully folded and compacted rain suit. And if it rains, it is a good thing this comes with a rain cover. It will need it.
B004RCR064|1|For starters that is NOT a pic. of 1259-105, and second your over priced by at least 250.00!!
B0072UHZF4|5|Great and easy product to install.  Between Hyundai and Curt, this is a dream.  Just know that with a Velostor you cannot haul large loads
B00DP2UYE2|1|Tire lasted three days
B00TXVNZQI|5|Key fits in perfectly and able to use without opening case. My Benz has push to start ignition so no need to ever open case.
B00MG9D1G8|5|Very well made,heavy duty,fits several size bar just by changing rubber inserts,<br />very pleased,<br />thanks
B000CIIAMA|4|They were OK, but they were not as loud as I was expecting , because of past experience, so I had the resonator taken off, so now they are a lot better.
B000FQ7HQY|5|It worked well......was quik to install.
B00MU7BFUU|1|Nowhere on here does it say that this product is plastic definitely not worth it and regret buying!!!
B002692308|5|Great buy!  This trim piece (OEM or otherwise) doesn't really come off w/o breaking.  This is a great cheap solution.
B003YYMM1E|1|wouldn't stick. threw away
B004N5WHE0|5|Very good item!
B0027QWNGO|5|It does get in the way of the rear passenger side passenger a little. But I'm usually in the car alone. And if I did have a rear seat guest all I have to do is pull on one velcro strap.  Otherwise it has enough space to hold a substantial amount of litter.  Does me well for unneeded receipts, post-its, and printed out directions. The depth is about right to hold a 20 ounce water bottle. The width will comfortably hold two.  The bottom compartment... *shrug*, I don't know why anyone would need the bottom compartment but its there.
B00VYCO8BK|5|Product fits well. Installation was easy. Allows for easier shifting when your hands are at the ten and two position. Appears to be high quality aluminum with well molded plastic cup that attaches to paddles.
B00N2D206E|5|Great product to use on car when daughter was training. Other drivers much more respectful in our busy city (San Antonio TX) and we appreciated it.
B00IXWDBVW|5|Fast delivery, good product...
B005ASY23I|5|I've used this several times and it works great!  Diffidently better than one that plugs in the 12 volt outlet inside.
B000C9J0QY|5|Excellent fit for 2003 Tacoma
B00AB2IE8C|5|Looks great on my 2011 F-150, easy to install, reasonable pricing!
B00GPY2DNW|5|Fits perfect on my 2014 Tiguan. Good material. Fast delivery.
B00DS07U02|1|Maybe I got a bad batch.  It does not adhere to the surface I was fixing (metal).  The product seems tacky and I thought it would adhere to surfaces like metal, etc., but the product I received doesn't stick well.  I see that some buyers like it, but a few other buyers like me are not impressed with the way it sticks to other surfaces.  I wanted to plug holes in rusted metal (car) which are not visible (firewall) and this product did not stick..I cleaned the rusted surfaces around the hole down to good metal and this product did not stick to metal.  This product acts like chewing gum....seems tacky at first but it does not stay in place very long...peels away.  I wouldn't use it be a &#34;quick roof&#34; because I would think that the repair wouldn't last long.  I bought another product from Amazon which is much better..it sticks to metal.  The instructions say use on clean surfaces and prep the rubber with primer solvent.  I cleaned my surface, but had no &#34;primer solvent&#34;...the instructions should have what primer solvent to use. Product seems tacky and I therefore assumed that it would stick without use of primer solvent. The product peels away the metal with little effort.  Directions are screwey...has that rubber needs to be primed with &#34;solvent primer&#34; and never states what &#34;solvent primer&#34; to use.  When the product wrapping has &#34;quick rook seam tape..double sided butyl adhesive..&#34; one assumes that product has self-adhesive properties.
B00651CBHI|2|Like most people that drive H3's, I have an issue with my factory antenna getting beat up when I go thru a car wash.  Mine was bent, the paint had been rubbed off half of it, and the spiral wire that goes down the length of the antenna was broke free at the bottom and starting to come off.  So i bought this antenna.  The antenna was very easy to install, looks great, and has no problem going thru car washes (why I purchased it).  BUT, AM/FM antennas have one job and that's to receive AM/FM broadcasts, which this one does poorly.
B0099Z4MJ2|5|does what it's supposed to!
B00LNOV8K8|4|i like it but the plastic grips wear out
B00C5RJF5C|5|Fit perfectly just like original.
B0024E669E|1|It's HUGE and the Manufacturer themselves told me not to rebuy one????? Seriously.<br /> I measured my pop-up, I compared to the listing on this site, I ordered the cover. It arrived. It is HUGE! I would say at least 2 feet too wide and 3 to 4 feet to long. I cant even strap it under my camper. I called the manufacturer to get a better idea on how to size the re-order. She told me there was a manufacturer error and that re-figuring size/reordering would not fix my issue???? I suggested just ordering a size or two smaller. The woman on the phone said &#34;That wont fix your problem. There was a manufacturing error and re-ordering or downsizing would not solve that.&#34; ????? I have never in all my years had a manufacturer tell me now to re-order one of their products..... I will take the advice.....
B000COU5EA|5|Works great
B00RZ154VW|4|Good quality of the box. How long they last will garner the final review
B009KA8Z0I|5|will use it for myself and if anybody  else gets in troble
B00YI6M8W0|4|nice fit looks great
B00DBEO8Q4|1|Terrible, do not waste your money. I bought these on 3-17-2015 to replace working, albeit yellowing, stock bulbs on a 2002 F250. One has failed already at a mere 5 months old. I say agian, the 13 year old factory bulbs were still working, just faded. Even when new the output was fr less than my old original bulbs. Save yourself some time and move on to another bulb.
B00LGXTOUC|5|I had to wait 3 weeks because they were sold out but it was worth the wait, the product was machined  very well, everything lined up and worked like it was supposed to. I would definately order again from Bikeberry and I support small American companies that serve the public good. Thanks Bikeberry !
B00HZBJI4G|1|It is very cheaply made and does not look as if it could hold up on an outside car window.  It literally looks like it was run through an ink jet printer that was running low on ink.  This product is very disappointing and by far is not even worth the price or postage stamp. It does not look like the picture.  Please do not buy!
B006V3SKZM|5|The decals were just what I wanted and were as ordered. One is now on my car to replace a decal of the flag that was fading.
B00SQG82BY|5|Perfect stickers. The best seller.
B00N414H7Y|5|all good thanks ..
B006BDVI5Q|5|Worked great! Got them cut and took 10 seconds to program each key.
B00UI6H5RM|2|The Clear bra was cut incorrect. Was difficult to install
B00GM4UUZS|4|It worked
B009LNKXEA|3|It looks pretty good. It was difficult to imstall. The power stapler I had didn't work well. The closure seat frame was too tough and staples bent. Finally used a 1/2&#34; sheet metal screw with a washer. That seemed to be much better. I think better installation instructions would help.
B004TX8W8G|5|Great horn.  If you want a loud, and I mean a REALLY loud horn then this is it.  You hit this horn and they will think there is a 18-wheeler behind then.  They'll drop that cell phone and pay attention.  Comes with relay and 2 sets of wiring, so you can wirer it to work with your current horns or to replace them.  I'm ordering a second one for my other car.
B0006Z9SPW|5|Can't get better than Armor All. I've been using it for 25 years and it keeps my car interior​ looking new.
B007223HEA|3|If they were just available when you need them....
B003D1QVJ2|5|It does fit the 2015 CRV perfectly. Very easy to install and cheaper than buying at the dealership.
B00E40SYXM|4|Love these, just wish they provided just a bit more friction.  Overall, a great choice visually and pretty good functionally.
B006NZTZLQ|5|fantastic tool
B000KGCUMA|5|Put batteries in it but have not used it in a diagnostic situation
B000EQBN2O|5|Fit as advertised.
B002MBG05E|5|Excellent hose, stays free of kinks (if used with reasonable care) and the twist top fitting is very easy to use, even when your hands are wet and cold in an ocean winter.<br /><br />Remember never drink water from a regular garden hose, they leech either plastic or rubber into your water.
B00GBVHPV4|3|You get what you pay for.
B004PC0CQG|1|I got them with chipped mirrors n metal very disappointed
B001C6OZ48|5|These fit my 1999 Jeep Cherokee XJ perfectly.
B010C7MUOE|5|This is a VERY strong and well built bumper hitch.  We'll be using it to hold our bikes on our rv bumper.
B000C542YS|5|Fit Perfect!
B00JIEX722|5|Did 14 lights in my 2008 C35 Mercedes.  What a Wonderfull upgrade!  VERY BRIGHT, No polarity problems, No error code on Mercedes. Get 'em!
B00192JGN0|5|as described. Thanks!
B00BYGMCF0|5|This part really gave my bike an awesome new look. Very easy to install and got them shipped to me in 3 days. I will be ordering all my parts through them. Priced good and great quality
B00GD2ZF3G|5|cheap and works
B0031IDXBQ|5|As described.<br />Flex Fuel compatible.
B004ZF35GM|4|quality is average for a typical $50 hid kit. the 6k bulbs seems too blue to me...wish i should have done 4300k or 5000k for all my lights
B00VSCZLQ2|4|Its a great steering wheel but the stitching was coming loose right out of the box and where the carbon fiber meets the metal was poorly trimmed and knife marks were left in the metal but I retrimmed the fabric and used a paint pen to hide the knife marks other than those two things I love it wish I could of gave it 5 stars
B002X6VXL4|5|did not use a lot, did need I to inflate a tire and worked grea
B00WMK3O7W|5|They are great!!  I was very reluctant to order these thinking they may arrive and be the type that are very thin and flimsy, don't stay well in place and not hold the dirt like previous ones I have purchased at walmart.  BUT I was VERY impressed when these arrived!!  They are very nice heavy duty mats. The have excellent grip on the bottom and do not slide around so they stay in place where you put them.  The grooves in the top hold the sand and dirt amazingly.  I have 4 children and they track so much dirt into my van it's unreal, so I was so happy to see these holding the dirt like they should and now all I have to do is take it out and give it a shake on the ground instead of spending time at the car wash vacuuming every week.  I LOVE the connected mats for the back. It covers so much more area than just having two small mats back there.  I will be purchasing another set so I can put another connected mat in my third row area and the two front mats in my husbands truck.  I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
B006H34AE6|2|Sheds rubber filaments, lost many the first time I used it.  Does not work well on all fabrics.
B00SH4LUNM|5|good
B0034ZUZM6|5|Nice winch and seems to be quality built. This is replacing a warn winch that only lasted about 2 years (which was disappointing). Super winch looks and feels like a quality unit. This size seems to be too big for the Honda Foreman. We had to cut out some of the plastic skirting on the ATV to get it in. Used it several times and it worked very well. I'm happy with this purchase.
B0114Y44J8|1|Does not have the 'teeth' that are used to secure the screw.  These are a cheaper version of the real WaveEater clips that have that screw.  The real ones you just snap on...these you have to take the screw out to install and hope the screw doesn't vibrate out over time (use RED loctite!)
B000VB5TK4|5|I bought the weather tech floor mats for my husbands birthday and he loved them! And once he placed them in his 2005 Honda accord sedan he loved them even more. I also fell in love with these mats when I saw how they looked in his car and now I'm saving to buy them for my car. These floor mats fit perfect. Not only are they a perfect fit but they are perfect for protecting your cars carpet. They cover so much surface area of the carpet because these mats are not just flat they have sides that go up a little which helps protect more of the cars carpet area and for heavy spills. And the sides mold right with your cars floor as well for a perfect fit. The mats also look really good in my husbands car, their not &#34;cute&#34; looking but they do look like they were made just for his car and because they fit perfect they blend in with his cars carpet especially if you get the same color as your cars carpet. They fit perfect, easy to clean, durable, cover so much surface area, and looks good which makes them worth the price. I am now a huge fan of Weather Tech products and now want to buy everything they offer :)
B00U224GH4|5|&#34;A fast alternative<br />When my seat belt clip broke, I had no alternative for my Toyota Wish. I purchased these Car Safety Seat Belt Seatbelt Clip which came in as a pair. I could not take chances on my security so I made sure hat I specified that I needed them in two days, and they arrived on time. They fitted just like the original and hardly noticed the difference. The buckle securely grips on the receiver tight enough and it is comfortable. Thank you to this product, am back to my routine safely.&#34;
B000Q8GVPY|5|worked just as needed, even work on other pulleys which I didn';t expect it to work on
B0040DVL6U|5|I've owned and used Broadway mirrors for years. Normally I'll get the 270mm flat, but decided to try the convex again since I'm older and want the wider view.  No problems whatsoever as per usual.  Wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.
B001C6Q8OS|5|Nice fit. Replaced the old clouded and cracked 13 year old ones in car. Looks nice especially with the new LED replacement bulbs installed! Great price almost 80% less than local parts store!  In the end: great fit, great look, great price!
B003S1RQ2S|5|Twice the price at national home repair store. Easy install to replace alarm panel battery. 1 week after install- no problems.
B0032J1KAK|5|These provide a good view for blind spots.
B00Q33OHGQ|2|very flimsy
B008XNZZ7O|5|Odor is difficult to describe but it is a pleasant smell. Probably the closest to the smell is when you open a bag of gummy bears, citrus-like smell. My car is a non-smoker but did get rid of pickle smell when i dropped a jar of pickles lol-- I recommend you to buy this product.
B003IS3HV0|5|I live in the desert southwest so everything dries out. This product is great for my leather sofa and chair.  I recommend it to anyone who has leather furniture.
B00JH74EH2|5|Opt7 is never fail .  This is my second time ordering this brand and I'm not disappointed. Quality is very good. I installed these under my car and they look great
B004GFTC0E|5|work great
B004MUI7OA|4|I have never installed a fuel pump but this was cake AS LONG AS YOU KNOW HOW TO SOLDER!!<br />I do so it was easy.  :)<br />The old connector to the old pump must be clipped off and the new connector soldered onto the old wires (make sure you use shrink wrap around the wires once they are soldered together).<br />This was for a Camry and I did not have to drop the gas tank.<br />Simply lift up on the rear seat and it pops right off, disconnect the lines (may need vice grips) and the plug, unscrew the 3-4 screws, then the 8 or 9 screws under that (USE A MAGNETIC SCREWDRIVER OR YOU WILL BE LOOKING FOR SCREWS UNDER THE CAR AND IN THE GAPS OF THE TANK), and pulled out the device.
B000CQDKBI|5|Its an exhaust gasket
B000C7VYWY|4|Came on time. packed well. fits just like it said it would. and it came with tool to remove trans lines
B00C88B8J4|5|As advertised. Simple installation.
B001CEG98A|5|Used to replace my old filters in an 08 Nissan titan.  It had a bunch of gross little flower leafs, pollens, some really small acorn things.  Just gross stuff.  I bought this over the generic offerings because it is carbon activated and comes in a sealed plastic bag so it wont absorb smells while it is warehoused for sale.
B00BITI6Q2|5|Perfect fit for my 2002 Toyota Corolla LE.  Installation was very easy.  I'm very glad I made the purchase.
B00RBML810|3|It works
B00Z515O5K|5|[[VIDEOID:33920da1e94232ad396d78fe1a837086]]This is a fabulous set of jumper cables , a must for everyone that should always a set of these for emergencies .<br />These are the quick and effective 12 feet long booster cables for cars,you can use these cables on a variety of batteries. From ATV's, Lawn Mowers, Cars, and Trucks.<br /><br />My husband is the car guy, so these are for him.He tried them when he had to get our ATV going , they worked perfect .<br />This is a must you should all have a great set of these in your car.They will always do the job, because of the quality of this set.<br /><br />I highly recommend these great jumper cables ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B0024X2SC4|5|arrived as promised in good condition  --  used to adapt a converter to a water pump to provide 120 to 12 volt power  --  connected up, and now I can water my indoor plants easier all year around....
B003AOEAHC|5|So nice to be able to have my fire extinguisher out of the way!  Works perfectly and allows quick easy access in case of emergency.
B0006JLU22|4|Works great.  Stickers are upside down but who cares? The price is right
B007YISQHK|5|Avoided a $2000 repair requiring a whole new ac compressor when all I needed was this bearing for less than $20.  A few words of caution a press is needed to push the old bearing out and to put the new bearing in.  You will need a tool to stake the bearing in place.  You may also need to find something to push the bearing and pulley on the compressor by tapping with a hammer on said tool against the inner race onto the compressor.
B005R27ZK4|5|Fits my 2015 Nissa Versa perfectly
B00C1CEJKW|5|Everything g went well with this purchase.  The product works as advertised

B00MJ46RMA|1|I applied item according to instructions on Sunday, August 16, 2015 and two days later on Tuesday, August 18, 2015 as I was traveling down the highway at a rate of 60mph it blew off my car!<br />Luckily it did not hit another vehicle or interfere with another driver.
B00O36U7OG|1|Sucks.
B000SQFD4O|5|Great price on hard to find product!
B00IB1X73M|5|Perfect fit
B002DW3WQC|3|Overall, I would recommend this product as long as people are aware of its pros and cons (of which there are many).<br /><br />This is the best looking steering wheel cover I've ever seen and felt.  It is designed to fit perfectly over a Honda Insight steering wheel (and I believe the Fit and certain civics as well) and to a certain extent, look like there isn't a steering wheel cover on at all.  For those that dislike the common practice of low end cars coming with cheap feeling steering wheels instead of leather or wood, this is a decent alternative.  In addition, the Insight steering wheel (and shift knob) is known to start showing wear very prematurely (four years for me).  This does a good job of covering up the embarrassing looking premature aging of the steering wheel without looking like you put a tacky steering wheel cover on.  HOWEVER, while this cover looks decent and feels relatively good with zero slipping, it is still noticeable that it is a steering wheel cover for most.<br /><br />I do have several issues with this product that prevented me from giving a better rating.  First, the price is on the expensive side at around $50.  This does give you that OEM look and decent quality, but I still feel that it is overpriced when non Honda covers that look similar (only missing the spoke cutouts) cost $10.  Another HUGE issue I had with this cover when it arrived is that it didn't come with any instructions. None. Not a piece of paper, picture, or even a website to go to.  Luckily, thanks to Youtube, I was able to find some ok tutorials.  But for the price premium, this is simply unacceptable. For older individuals that don't automatically think along the lines of Youtube research, I could see a lot of confusion.  In general, even with the youtube tutorials, of which I watched a few, this is a tedious process and takes at least an hour.  The tricky parts are figuring out how to get the loops tight enough so there is minimal gap and also, angling yourself tosee the holes on the back.  There will be a lot of moving of the steering wheel and bumping your head. And since there aren't any directions, where to begin threading and how to thread the area with the spokes can be confusing.  While I encourage you to watch the youtube tutorials, basically, you double stitch the threading at the end of each spoke so it doesn't come loose and then thread along the back.  I also suggest going to Michaels or some other craft store and buying a curved upholstery needle.  It is a lifesaver, especially on doing the back holes.  Cost about $1 and well worth it.  The only reason I discovered this is because the cheap needle that came with it broke after I was about 1/4 through and I needed to get another one and decided to give the curved one a shot. Eventually, you will get a rhythm and it will go much faster. Also, unlike the video tutorials, I suggest starting on the right spoke and working counter clockwise.  This is due to the learning curve.  With me, my threading and gaps starting looking much better after the first eight or so threads as I was getting the hang of the tension and steps to do. Starting on the right side and working your way counterclockwise will make the uglier stitching unnoticeable to most in the passenger side.<br /><br />Some people commented that there wasn't enough thread. Mine had plenty leftover (as long as you are pulling the thread tight enough and not leaving slack).  I had over two feet leftover.  I'm not sure if they weren't doing it right, or if they got shorted on thread.  Leave a three inch tail at the beginning to tie off when the two sides meet, but otherwise, you should have enough.<br /><br />Another big issue I had was that in order to get rid of the gap on the inside, you have to constantly hold the previous threading with one finger and pull hard with the other hand. I suggest using tight gloves (gardening, golf, weight lifting, bike riding, or thin leather dress gloves etc.) if you have them.The problem is that there is a fine line between pulling it tight and pulling it too tight and the leather can and will rip a little at those holes.  I have about three holes in various places where the holes show a few mm of ripping if you look very closely. Its not glaringly obvious, but it is annoying for perfectionists, which you probably are if you are paying $50 for a steering wheel cover that takes over an hour to put on. However, a gap between the stitching is even worse looking so take caution because pulling very hard is necessary.<br /><br />Finally, my last and final complaint is the color. I knew it would be black leather with blue string, so I'm not really taking a point off of this because of it, but still felt it was worth noting because the picture is a little misleading (shows black steering wheel plastic, and stitching isn't really visible).  For those with a 2010-2011 Insight (and maybe other years), the interior dash and steering wheel plastic is usually dark blue plastic.  I'm assuming the Fit and Civics offered grey and black plastic as main options, because otherwise, I can't figure out why Honda would offer an OEM steering wheel cover in two colors (black and grey) that don't in any way match the Insight's interior.  I think of the two, the black will blend in better because it does match some minor trimming in the car such as the stereo and shift knob.  But, for the OCD, it will definitely not match perfectly. This is another reason you can tell the cover is not original because looking closer, you can see where the blue steering wheel peeks through the black cover at the spokes.  Finally, the last issue is the blue string.  Why on earth did they choose bright blue string?  And not a subtle blue, but a deep electric blue string.  I know that Honda seems to have an extremely hard time of not letting its teenager FWD boy racer mentality not show in its cheaper cars with their sometimes gaudy design cues, but this is just tacky at best.  Nothing in my car matches this blue stitching.  While I usually like opposing matching thread colors on cars as it gives a nice contrast, this looks stupid.  I honestly wish I had spend the extra few dollars and bought my own waxed thread in either black or grey to match the interior better.  You could probably also buy thread that matches your paint color such as white, red, etc., although I'm not sure how that would look. In the end, I think black would have been my preferred choice though, since it probably also would have hid the imperfections better.<br /><br />In all, this was a tough one to review.  I do like the final result, and my car does look better than it did before the cover due to the wear and tear on the steering wheel.  I needed a cover and this was really the only option for me that looked better than dealing with the wearing steering wheel.  I personally hate the look of obvious steering wheel covers, and sometimes, they are just plain dangerous as there is give on them.  It drives nice with it on and doesn't feel at all unsafe, feeling very similar to my leather steering wheel on my 2015 Toyota Sienna.  But you will have to have patience to put this on, research a lot, and I would suggest getting the new curved needle (even if yours doesn't break) and possibly black waxed string if the hyper blue string doesn't sound aesthetically pleasing to you. If you don't have patience and aren't good with tedious tasks and attention to detail, this project, which is exactly what it is, will not be for you.
B000JL95TC|5|This is the 3rd summer we have continued to use Coghlan's mosquito sticks and with continued satisfaction.  Great for placing near camp bathrooms,  showers (outdoor)  and near eating areas.
B00OZVD46C|4|I haven't had an issue with the straps on my 2010 JK. Based on the few poor reviews, maybe the ones for the TJs are made poorly? I dunno. I don't just let the doors fly open, either. It is a strap, after all. Regardless, these are keeping my doors from swinging all the way open. I haven't tried using the &#34;adjustable&#34; feature, as I'm satisfied with the length of the strap.
B0006IX7XS|5|It is a lot better than the plastic ones.
B007EHOVNE|5|I used this as a replacement when I accidentally drove through the car wash with the radio on.  This worked fine as a replacement and as good as new.
B007JW8ROS|5|Received quickly and product was just as described
B00VDP98U4|5|My helmet is very well made.  It fits very well. I haven't worn it on my motorcycle  yet. The color is lighter than pictured.  I wanted it to match my bike.
B004JBI6C0|5|Perfect fit & function
B000AR7KVA|5|Gets the job done
B0069TND14|5|Good
B00DSVMCSQ|4|shoulder stitching bothers my neck sometimes, but other than that it's a great vest.
B000E682FU|4|Works
B004FFHJ14|5|The sunshade came in a nice fully heat shield licensed bag.  The shade is big and bulky, but the Toyota Prius has a gigantic window, so I was expecting it to be huge.  Like the other reviewers have stated it is harder than most shades to take out and roll up,  just to make it easier and quicker I do take it outside of the car to roll it up, but I feel that if I needed to I could do it inside the car.  It also has a Velcro strap that secures the shade when you roll it up.  Overall it does exactly what I want it to do and that is keep my car cooler, especially since I have dark tinted widows so between the two my car stays really cool, 5 stars and I would definitely recommend this sunshade.
B004HCM9HE|5|awesome
B001O0XKO8|4|quit and perfect fit. Need to drive hard enough for rotors not to rust up.
B0083G3AXC|5|Great addition to lounge chair.
B00M9N5GF0|1|Applies terribly. Can't make it not look textured. I've used other touch up pens and this doesn't measure up. Ended up using a close white spray can just to protect the area. Waste of money
B00IAYU4MM|5|97 grand tsi started on the rear it in with no issues,then on to the front,I put my jack from the jeep between the axle and the body don't over do it brakes lines only stretch so far Also spring  compressor needed. Sway bar links undo them at the bottom. Have fun take your time!
B00BMPEN7S|5|Awesome kit. Hard part was getting my old drum system off due to the age of the trailer. Install was a breeze. Be sure to plan out how to wire the reverse lockout especially if you use a 7pin to 4pin adapter. Braking is noticeably better, used on multiple 40 min hwy drives and a couple 1:30 drives. Tempted to add on the other axle. Only thing I needed not in the box was new washers for the outside bearings. Only bad thing was my box was really REALLY beat up and was amazed everything was intact. Return or UPS? Dunno
B0009JKI72|5|I could tell from the moment it first rained these were the right ones to buy.  Smooth clear windows and will buy again.
B0010DZZQA|5|Filter works great in my car.
B000IYY7S4|5|pads stop very well, good improvement over worn barakes
B00ZPMVKD4|5|These LED lights are awesome! They are really really super bright! It comes in a 10 pack however only 8 were actually in my pack. Also you may need to get a resistor for these light when using as a turn signal because the turn signal will go really super quick! These lights will fit almost any vehicle!!  These LED lights have a vey long life, 56000 plus hour operating span! These LED lights are so unbelievably easy to install I can do it myself with my hunnys help. These light also come with a lifetime warranty which is a great insurance for any one who purchases them.<br />I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review! All opinions are 100% my own!
B000FW61EW|5|It sealed my rear window.
B000GKD5NI|5|Have a Subaru Forrester and no longer receive bright glares off cars during the day or night!  Love this. It helps keep the car cooler and we still see through it to drive. Not sure how we lived without it.
B005J6JRMM|5|Worked perfectly in our 2011 VW Jetta wagon and our 2011 Mercedes e350. We used these to make it easier for our 4 year old to buckle himself in his booster seats. The seat belt latches were difficult to reach behind the booster seats and these remedied that. We had to 'stack' two together in one of the cars so it was accessible enough for him. Works great and seems to be high quality.
B00ONHM6F8|5|Great product. Fit perfectly!!
B00GEIAA0C|5|Works great in my Husqvarna mower.  Use it to change the oil every year.
B0000AY3X8|5|Love these for drying all sorts of things!  Used them on the boat, the RV, in the shower and the car.  Long lasting and easy to store ready for use.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|very bright, I'm using on a mower but the brackets can mount to about anything you can put the mount stud through.
B001W9OP86|3|I installed these on my 01 TJ. They fit pretty well. Thay actually fit the rear seat much better than the front. Installation wasn't a walk in the park, but wasn't too difficult.<br /><br />I didn't expect a $200 fit from a $40 item, but they could have done a little better on the front seats. They don't conform to the contours very well, and kind of puff out in the mid back area; not so bad that it ruins the look, but certainly noticeable. If you have some beat up seats, and don't want to spend what the high end covers cost, these will certainly work, and are absolutely an improvement over ragged seats.
B00VITLCB8|4|Shut up very quickly was very impressed have yet to put it on will update
B00GMIX5BA|5|I use these to hold up my ½ ton pickup, no problem. Look at the junk they sell at the big three automotive stores, these are clearly better/stronger. These essentially are protecting your life!
B0052SF0LO|4|Worked as described, i added 5 units to the sides of my condo and they worked great!<br />I had to replace one of the units due to power issues and Amazon send me a unit within two days Kudos Amazon for a great customer service!
B004V8XW5C|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B0066QTKZS|5|Good
B009F5AMR2|5|Put on a 2003 Ford F-150.  Extremely easy to install and built to the high quality expected of Reese products.  I used 2 jack stands to balance the hitch then worked one bolt on each side at a time until it was all in place.  It bolted easily around the spare tire with plenty of room to work the bolts.  All-in-all from the time I opened the box to tightening the final bolt, maybe 20 minutes taking my time and installing by myself.  It would have been really nice if Reese would have included a hitch cover.  I would absolutely recommend.
B00KTIW7SQ|5|Functions like it's supposed to
B008BMQYGI|5|Looks exactly like picture, VERY pleased with it!!
B00GMNL8LO|5|Looks Great completed the look on my black car. However the resonator doesnt change the sound all that much.
B00DJ5KL6Q|5|Works well, for Honda rancher. I would buy these again
B0002KKIXC|5|This is good stuff. does the job.
B00DBEMVMM|5|I switched out all my bulbs on my tail lights with bulbs from tuning pros and they do a great job ! All their products are amazing and I highly recommend them !  As soon as I put these bulbs in one bulb is blown out. I switched sockets to see if it's just the wiring but it's not. I recived one blown bulb. Contacted them hopefully I can get another bulb ..
B009152AH6|2|bad
B00G0ONA2U|5|During some repair work, the original clutch on my 04 Dakota was left out in the rain and got some water in the bearing. When reassembled into the truck, it had a noisy bearing. I bought and returned 3 different aftermarket clutches from AutoZone and NAPA which did not perform correctly. The aftermarket clutches were too stiff and ran the fan unnecessarily. This caused a lot of loud roaring noise from the fan, decreased power and poor gas mileage. This MOPAR clutch works correctly and now the truck is back to normal.
B000GU24HG|3|This cover is perfect for an indoor garage but for outdoor I don't think it would last a year out the harsh elements unless there is a roof over it,  the real issue with this cover is that it's to soft and could rip very easily if not handle with care
B002E4XFIO|5|awesome
B003WOZOUM|5|Once I figured out the straps fitting correctly in the door, I had a great road trip! It stayed on my car, didn't slide (I used an anti skid thing), all the way from Utah to North Carolina to Texas!
B00OBVSGIM|4|Great price, look great, adhesive on tape for the top not the best but all in all very good product.
B0055F50UU|5|Worked better than we expected for the price. Very good quality and we didn't have any issues using them for the whole summer securing large and heavy equipment in our semi trailer for long hauls.
B00MC65KOG|5|Bought this for the turbo intake in our fire pump house. Someone had stolen the original.
B00V0D5QAA|5|Cosmetically perfect, make sure you have hallow handlebars before purchasing. Well machined, tight grip.
B000EDOSS8|5|Bought these hoping they would fix the the recent leak we just found in our rv. Had my husband install them and they worked perfectly! There is now enough clearance from the rv for the water from the ac to drain.
B00192QB9M|5|Excellent product
B00CI1V5JO|5|Hubby put it on his car.  Looks great and sticks very well.
B004P9A35E|5|This compressor is faster than I thought it would be.  It is simple to use. It does get hot, so give it some time to cool off.
B001C9U1XY|5|No joke...Advance auto wanted $32 for exact same item.  Easy install and perfect fit.  2006 Cobalt LT 4 door.
B001U7JTFY|5|Great product and easy to install!
B001GG09GW|5|These are not the droids your looking for. Relive the action
B00914H14O|4|Product arrived promptly and is good quality.
B00684TAYY|5|Great Product. ...!!!
B004GCFFNK|3|Part does not come paint ready, had to sand off the high gloss finish in order to paint it.
B000Q71N8K|1|This product may work great for some people. I wouldn't have bought it unless the product reviews had backed that up - and largely they do. But some of the reviews talk about getting a lemon and the terrible customer service from this company, and it's all true. The unit I bought didn't work at all - right out of the box. I didn't discover this until I was packing for the camping trip for which I had bought the unit. Not being a procrastinator, I had ordered the unit more than 30 days in advance of the trip, so when I discovered that I had a lemon, I was outside the 30 day return window. When I contacted the company, they did say that I could return the unit, but only at my expense (which is a sizable fraction of the cost of the entire unit). So now I have a lemon unit sitting in my basement taking up space, and the choice of cutting my losses, or sending this unit back and crossing my fingers that the replacement one isn't a lemon too.
B00HTIO14C|5|Best quality.  My gixxer looks awesome #bikermom
B00GZLMEPM|5|This item works vert well.  Would recommend.
B005B0SC0O|5|Works just fine !
B000CQDLNK|4|Worked for what I needed perfectly.  I hate the label though, it's a pain to peel cleanly, and it's near impossible to get all the adhesive grime off after.  Have some goo gone or goof off ready (something stronger than plain acetone) if you want a clean install.<br /><br />2.5&#34; inner diameter to 3.0&#34; outer diameter, used it to connect a 3.0&#34; inner diameter muffler to a 2.5&#34; outer diameter system using two appropriately sized walker/dynomax stainless steel band clamps (the lap joint style ones), for an awesome, clean, leak free exhaust that's fully able to be disassembled at will.
B0062YX2JO|5|Easily applied, all letters came off cleanly onto the windows.
B0035CXLLK|5|My fiance and I love our key chains #CouplesThatRideTogetherStayTogether
B0006N5RYK|5|This item was recommended to me by a family member.  Had to use cable from old cap as we could not get loose from camper.  Definitely worth the money, especially if you are somewhere that you can dump some of your grey water so that your tanks don't fill up.
B004PQDNZ4|5|This really looks good on my care!
B0001CMUV4|5|Stopped that unnerving rattle especially going over bumps and rough roads, install was easy. BTW some reviewers say you can just buy the u bolts at Home Depot but its the steel bracket that makes this work, not just the bolts
B00LAJTEFW|5|It worked great for my application.
B0009V1WS4|1|This lock was promoted as going with the Prorack 2 bike hitch carrier. It does not work with it at all. It is threaded backwards and not compatible. I had to go through the effort of returning it and then Amazon wanted to charge me for the shipping. They eventually credited me the difference but it took me hours of  hasseling to make it happen.
B00Q3CPAW2|2|i LOVE that it's batman. But it's too complicated to put it on, and it doesn't fit right.
B006KGX2O4|5|The tool kit worked as advertised. Never knew such a small set tool could be made with workable accuracy.
B004DWY57A|3|Having problems with loosing satelites.
B00HCVRPY4|5|Ladies this will make your life a little more happier, not having to stretch to get your purse or bags
B005FK4THK|5|great product
B0096Q3B9G|5|Wasn't expecting it to be metal, thought it would be plastic, it's awesome.
B000EQU1DQ|5|Replaced flooded Audi S4 original horns with this and the High Note. Not so loud, but plenty good enough.
B000DING78|5|Great product!
B000VDQQ8G|5|It worked
B004GCRQJG|5|Excellent, I liked the product completion, 5 stars from me!
B005RA70ME|5|Well made and water proof.  love the bays
B000DN7T3A|5|Not the manliest sounding, but it gets the job done.
B000CP8FMI|5|Showed up on time went on with out a hitch no pun intended
B00LH8LL0C|3|Too narrow should have gotten the 4&#34;
B00HRXNLIG|5|Arrived super fast. Works great and to install the new piece only took about 10 seconds. (Fit perfect on my honda civic 2010)
B00BBEJLLS|5|Very Cute
B00HS5W3FA|5|Easy stock replacement and nice performance
B004BTFPRE|5|Good
B000IYTT8M|5|All ok
B000JFHMRU|4|Works great love it
B008RAD3NG|5|These are worth every penny, I have wheeled Jeeps for 27 years, these are the cleanest way to stop the leaks, it is just a bonus that they are reusable.
B0009N0W60|1|Not Accaptable
B007JZKBVW|3|Not that bright
B00CWV6B26|4|New OEM, not much to know.  Used to replaced scraped and scratched originals.  Only thing is, the new ones are both tossed into 1 bag, free to scrape and scratch each other up.  Mine came with minimal scratching, but they sure aren't perfect.
B001DKUTR0|3|The box it came in cost more than the product.
B005NLQAHS|5|Pretty cool can keep track of throttle and water temperature
B001OA4O7A|5|I love them!
B00LIXZLR0|5|Pretty sweet! Wishing they could be a little brighter... Haven't any water problems yet so that's a plus
B0065M5GJ2|4|Caps fit and look great. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that it came on August 20, 6 days late.
B0009IQZFM|5|Just used this towel for the first time yesterday and it did a great job. Very absorbent!
B0009IQZH0|5|Just used this towel for the first time yesterday and it did a great job. Very absorbent!
B000GU0P4A|5|Thank You,<br /><br /> Tbone
B0031BCPMQ|5|Simple swap out and lowered the bike just as they stated. Not my bike so I can't tell you how the ride change is. Seemed pretty decent for my fat ass.
B003CJEKES|5|Fantastic quality, even the fitments. I NEVER get good fitments when I buy aftermarket parts, but these were great. Had more than enough parts to install just about any extras that are on some motorcycle fenders. The holes lined up and install was less than 5 minutes.
B00JXYHP34|4|It doesn't work as good as the one we replaced.  But it works.
B008ECCBFS|1|It does not work  properly.  Iv already had to replace it. Went ahead and got it directly  from toyota. What a waste  of time and money
B000COBLKW|5|Bright and cheap
B001Y91MFI|5|Great price and they look great on the car.  The local store was 4x more expensive!
B00RYHUQMY|5|smelled like.........bubblegum nice
B0042PCD4A|5|Did just what I expected
B005S575O6|5|Very easy to install, took less than 30 mins
B000C59WF2|5|Great price for a great part!! You guys keep coming thru!!
B008BX5ODQ|1|Where are the instructions to install this? My husband wanted these so I bought them for his birthday but there are install instructions.
B001664JOA|4|Actually pretty comfortable
B00KTIR1ZU|4|I bought these two remote for my Chevy cobalt and both work prefect.
B000COO1P4|4|as described. Thanks!

B00390PV6Q|5|Installed in about 5 minutes. Looks good, works great.
B000BQQ0UW|5|Thanks
B00HESLIBG|4|Super easy install and really helps clean up the console door...nice product
B005NBZK9W|5|I had this for almost 2 years before it started to rust around the mounting holes and that's only because the screws rusted and it spread to the cover! I will be buying another one because it looks great!
B002L9J0ZY|5|Fit perfect.
B00AZ0SSOU|5|LOVE IT
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great sunshade and great followup service.
B005CLNBQC|5|Great fit
B006MIWA6Q|5|Fits perfect. Shipped on time. Love it. Thanks!
B00T0TYXGY|4|So far, so good. It has stood up to burning hot temps, rain, and a few times through a car wash.
B000C6KLEM|5|Much more reasonable price than the spec'd ones for Yamaha GP800R and GP1200R
B000BNS9HW|3|Mounting holes had to be drilled in order to make attachment. Original bumper had a bracket with holes 45 degrees. the ones with this bumper were straight and in line.
B003L35990|5|Excellent high performance oil filter.
B000E2CVIS|4|good deal
B000A0CAJE|5|Exact fit for 2003 Camry
B00027GWTY|5|It was everything I needed to get the job done.<br />High quality parts...<br />Thanks.
B008I7P3D6|5|Arrived timely, undamaged, and works perfectly.
B00VQMV9TM|5|Super fast shipment, fit perfect, could not be happier with purchase.  Plus GREAT price!!
B00PLD3WEW|1|Well. Im not sure it if worked or not. I never had a chance to use it untill couple days ago and it turn blue for couple minutes then nothing. No light. no sound no nothing. i wonder if it ever worked getting cleaner air
B004ZG8GYC|1|Pedal flew off while I was driving. I  even used loctite on the screws-
B00CUE8WX6|5|Great quality parts, like OEM parts. I was very pleased with the purchase.
B00MUZN8TI|5|It works well, even in bright sun light
B0072UQ0EG|5|Fits perfectly on my 2015 Tacoma DCSB TRD Offroad.  The textured black looks great also.
B007PE06OE|5|This compressor was everything I thought it would be. Thanks was a great deal.
B0011O0YDW|5|Just the right height and comfortable to sit on. The swivel was a must and it only took about 30 minutes to put together.
B000BQWLE6|1|Thought this was big, but it's worthless. It's a size for a Barbie doll house. Totally worthless.
B000C5WCUE|5|ty
B00VNBEBCS|5|I installed these on my 2006 Ford F150. First let me say I went to these from using Innovited 55w HIDs and im glad i did. The install was vehicle specific so no harness to worry about, no reverse polarity, works with the auto on/off light feature on my vehicle and super sharp looking. Now i will admit theyre not as bright as my 55watt HID kit was, but theyre every bit as bright as a standard 35watt kit. The big difference i notice is they project further out wards than HID lights do but not as wide. Seriously though, just simple plug and play, less than 5 minutes to put them in. I included a few pictures with and without the Opt 7 led fog lamps and my led light bar.
B000CKDPHI|3|DOES NOT FIT 2000 Protege ES 1.8L as stated by other user. Amazon Needs to fix
B00GD8LF4S|1|Amazon and the packaging that contained the deflectors both stated that the product fit a 2015 Hyundai Sonata. It does not. The rear ones seemed OK but the front, no way. ...beware
B007D5HXIW|5|Excellent product and seller.
B007NPOLQE|5|As described. Worked great .
B0002BC05A|4|Worked great better than I had thought. Much bigger tool than it looks here.
B00XO714XI|5|i didn't buy it on amazon.com but i did buy one from another place a little cheaper. IT fixed my portable lg. IT had a problem where it would not turn off at temp and kept running until my room was a frigid Iceland. it fit a LP1210BXR it may fit others of similar lg models just do a little research. Works like its supposed to. apparently these sensors go bad after a while and need to be replaced  and it is NOT hard to do at all.
B000C18QN0|4|Works ok moves around to much.
B005SUYU8U|5|Worked great, fast delivery.
B000C936YQ|5|perfect fit. As good as oem. This was a direct fit to pipes. No custom work neccesary.
B006ZDXPLM|5|great fit
B004MSJ7C8|5|Used it on my 1980 Yamaha xs650 with mikuni bs34 cv carbs worked just fine.
B00JN1TEJ0|2|Didn't even fit the knob wasn't right, had to fabricate it to fit and threw the pleather on the old knob and i GUESS it works, pretty terrible.
B003T7XUE4|5|This valve has made oil changes much simpler. I really don't even have to raise up my car anymore since the oil filter is on top. All I have to do is attach a 3/8 hose and lift the handle to drain the oil. The valve is a bit pricey, but the quality is outstanding. Dont fear about the valve opening up automatically, theres a spring that keeps the handle down. You do have to apply a bit of force to open it up, but im glad for that so I wont be driving over potholes and bumps with oil draining out. If I ever trade in my car, im bring taking this valve with me.
B00JA3BMDW|5|Used it for a short time (2 weeks) but so far so good. Very handy and easy to measure water or oil surface temperature when cooking.
B0017K69MA|5|Wonderful for my glass enclosured shower!  Makes the glass crystal clear!  Much better than plain old windex
B006JN5782|5|GREAT, store in place, no more fumbling, folding and looking, where did I put them?
B00KTMMQJM|5|great mini bike im 14 it fits me fine im 6ft almost:)
B000X243RQ|5|the best !
B003M0WRIS|5|Excellent product.
B007Z1U9FS|5|Didn't fit but great customer service.
B000GAN3GC|5|Good oil, fast shipping
B00FFAX2A0|5|Worked great
B00684TAYY|5|I saved a lot of money! Works great!!! On my first try. No problems what so ever! I highly recommend it.
B004W904QU|5|Exellent!
B0076M8TVM|4|A couple light coats goes a long way and easily lasts for 6+ months. It doesn't give the finish an overly plastic-y look and helps to bring the color out in the dip. Without applying this they color gets very dull and fades.
B000C916KM|1|not fit my truck
B00MEVO5U4|5|I likey
B000OUUG8M|5|Very Nice
B00199IJXG|5|Fit as expected and quality was good
B0067ERHP4|5|Bought this from Powersport Superstore and received it a day earlier than expected. They also had the best price I could find. This item replaced the Screamin Eagle Pro Race Tuner the previous owner had installed on my 2011 CVO Roadglide Ultra with K&N replacement air filter and Dragos Performance Dragula 2 - 2 into 1 pipe. Installation was fast and easy. Installed a base tune just to get the bike checked out for leaks in the new pipe but the bike ran better with the base tune than with the SEPRT . Frank Drago sent me a tune for this bike with his pipe and it runs even better. Looking forward to a trip to Utah to check fuel millage and see how the auto tune does and after that more Dragos cams and head work. there are many videos and performance shops that support the Thundermax and yes its pricey but time you pay for Dino tunes its cheaper in the long run. Love this product.
B00IITXY12|4|Quick delivery and easy to follow instructions.  They look great on my car.
B004MDEV38|5|Just like the other reviewer said, use a thread tap to clean the threads if you are putting this on an older car. I have a 2005 Honda Odyssey and I thought I had them clean but could not get the bolts in the last inch or so.  Easy fix, took it to the Monroe muffler or any mechanic with a impact gun and a minute later it was nice and tight.  My threads in the frame were all kinds of rusted so I just ordered the thread tap on amazon with the hitch. But even with the tap you need a good impact gun, I had a 1/4in one and it could not get through the rust.  Guy at the shop had a 1/2in one and it only took a minute to get the bolts tight.
B00YVQD4A2|5|I love this. It fits snugly on my visor and doesn't slip at all. It's so convenient when I'm switching between my shades and my glasses.
B000OUUGIW|5|Great Deal, no issues..
B0076PKC64|1|I bought these and only the halo light up and asked if the center was supposed to light up n u guys responded with there is no halo but there is... now cam u answer my question.....
B003WOZOUM|3|The bag itself is very durable, high quality. We do NOT have a roof rack so purchased this one because it says it would attach without one. The first method we tried was with the straps through the car. We have a 2014 Acura MDX and the straps barely connected and we couldn't get them tight. So then we tried the hooks. The reason I gave three stars is because we had a difficult time figuring out how to configure the straps to be able to easily pull them tight to secure the bag. We basically just improvised because we found the directions unclear. Also, some of the hooks popped out when we shut the doors. However, we felt it was secure enough to make it to the beach (3hrs) so we hit the road. During the trip we could see through the sun roof that the bag was shifting a bit (we didn't buy the non slip pad - maybe a mistake) so we ended up stopping 3 different times to check the bag and try to retighten the straps.<br /><br />We did eventually make it to the beach without a &#34;national lampoons&#34; incident, but on the return trip we sent some luggage back with friends so we didn't need to use it again.<br /><br />I feel that if there was a video available through the website that broke down in detail how to attach the bag without a rack it would be so helpful.<br /><br />I think that if you have a roof rack this would easily be a 5 star product.
B001KOY58S|5|very nice,perfect fits.
B002XJGP46|5|awesome
B00009W3SR|4|Installs like changing a bulb. Not a loud as I hoped but it is loud enough to catch someones ear that's all that is needed. Good product. I'll buy it again. Also the delivery was really fast, Way to go Amazon !!!!
B0002MABGE|4|Fits in my SUV nicely, I foster dogs so this helps as I don't have to worry about them jumping in my lap while I am driving. But most of them have figured out that the side bars slide in easy and they can get up front. I had to figure out a way to make them not slide. Once I did that I haven't had any issues.
B0007NXVB0|4|Not sure why people are not happy with the quality. Definitely better than harbor freight quality and heavier steel than HF engine stands. Sure, I will reinforce it a bit, but at $217 it's still a steal. All parts were there and arrived in good condition. Manual is lame, but it is easy to figure out how to put together from any picture.<br /><br />Update / Issues:<br />Important: Ford SB engines will require you to make brackets. I basically welded a head bolt to a small plate and slid the bolt through the engine mount on the stand.<br /><br />I would get significantly taller casters for this unit. You can't get a engine of a engine hoist very easily, since the stock casters do not clear a typical engine stand's legs.
B001NZZMCW|5|pads stop very well, good improvement over worn barakes
B00SHZHKWQ|5|Easy install. Nice fit.
B00O7ZAD6U|5|Great for the price. ..just be prepared to make your own holes for your windshield bracket bolts and make sure your windshield is at least 20 inches wide.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Good product
B00DPIECCG|5|Perfect fit for a 2005 Regular Cab. Passenger side mats have holes for the plastic no-slip tabs. Much better than the all carpet worn out factory &#34;TACOMA&#34; labeled mats I had.
B000C8479U|5|A+
B00VGL8MEI|5|Pin was just as described and delivered on time.
B001THWFII|5|Very Nice
B00H9S71LW|5|Works great with my 06 Acura TL. Used it with my LG G2, connecting was fast and easy and the original app they give you is just as great if not better than some of the other apps. I was able to get many different readings I am still figuring out, a lot of others I know and really sweet to see the info in real time on my phone. I was able to also get a code reading that was hidden. Every now and then the check engine would come on but would eventually disappear . Now I know what part is going to fail and will change it soon.<br /><br />This device will even save your driving route your millage, gas usage and so on. I'm still using is accuracy but so far it's been spot on. I do recommend this and my only con is that I should of spent the extra 20$ to get the one higher than this.
B00N7KNI1S|1|This doesn't fit on the front bumper of 2012+ JKs.<br />The plate cover is 1/2 inch to wide and will not fit between the fog lights on the bumper.<br /><br />Do NOT recommend this product.
B002XH7V0A|4|This is beautiful and it looks great in our bedroom. It is a bit hard to get it off the lining and onto the wall. But once it's up on the wall, it looks great with all of our wedding photos.
B004A6KBU4|5|Fit was good. Great performance so far.
B00EYJPMCO|5|When you go to install it for the first time have a few hours. Check out the YouTube video as well!
B00F58VFCE|1|Did not properly fit my rims.
B001DRH4JO|4|husband was pleased
B0046IXXLA|5|Great product and great price at 76 years young could not do without it
B00EQDFIW2|5|Nice
B00H36XX6C|5|I absolutely love this! It's an awesome 2 in one that is perfect for camping or when you don't have an outlet available. I was able to change my iphone and my kindle pretty fast and the flashlight always comes in handy. It easily stored with all my stuff without taking much room. I thought maybe about keeping it in my car as a backup method if something were to go wrong and I needed a phone charge. And really, who doesn't need a flashlight if they have a car breakdown? Big fan! Will probably get some as gifts because it's universally useful!
B00K0QRS7M|5|Prefect fit! installed on my motorhome to clear the spare tire.
B0009IQXAE|5|easy to use, just spray and wipe
B003TTV940|1|Picture is of square can, model # and what gets shipped is for round can... round can flows about 50% slower.
B000TV59EC|5|I'm a professional yacht captain. Aqua soft is the only TP I trust on the boats I run. Using the wrong TP in a marine head spells out trouble. The last thing you want to do is work on a toilet that someone else fouled up.
B001DRN9JS|5|Finally got around to doing the rear brakes on the 1999 Durango, these were exactly what I needed. Brakes no longer rubbing. Works great and I thought, good price as well.
B00B4KUC62|5|Product was as advertied and was delivered in a timely manner.
B004I0HG0U|5|Prefect replacement
B001AW6FS8|2|It does the job, kind of.  After a couple of weeks mine started getting holes from rain.
B004SX5HNA|1|cant see them over 50 yards away in the day light
B004KED8CO|5|does its job
B0006HNB8U|5|Good
B00ECGWRHC|5|I use to have one on my triple tree main large nut. It fell off. This one has a lock Allen screw. Its not coming off. NICE...
B00D3R1DEY|1|Back of pack crushed in against sissy bar and can not straighten it back out. Lose a good 2&#34; of inside space.
B002M4GEZ2|1|As soon as I installed, I had a problem.  After many hours of trying to figure out the problem, I took it to a mechanic, then to the local dealer.<br />Resistance was different than OEM.  Spending $700 for another new set.<br /><br />This was a 20 minute job to change out.  Installation done correctly, but flawed in wiring on equipment.  Aaarrrgghh!!!!<br /><br />Unfortunately (and stupidly) I threw away the packaging and old assemblies, so I cannot return.
B00KTIYXLU|5|Fallow instructions and it worked great.  At first I only turned the ignition key to &#34;off&#34; Accessories and it didn't work.  Turn the ignition key all the way to the &#34;stop&#34;.
B00JYXN34Y|5|Exactly what I needed.  Easy plug and play. Well, once I realized the previous owner had wired one side in reverse...
B000F6DNMQ|5|This parking mat is exactly what I needed for my garage so that I know exactly where to stop my car.  It also helps my husband put the car where it should be in the garage.
B00S5H72G0|5|I am very pleased with these keychains.  The embroidery is nice and the material is sturdy.
B0081S5IP0|5|The plastic sleeve keeps the cardboard placard secure and seems to be a heavy duty plastic which hopefully will last as these sleeves are hard to find in stores.
B01093Q9BQ|5|Got this for a coworker who had wrist pain at her computer. The size is perfect for that use. She loves it and says it's relieved the pressure. I realize this isn't meant to be a wrist product for computers but the material is much higher quality than the wrist guards I've seen, and it apparently helps her.  It's not as thick those other products, but it takes the edge off our offices glass desks.
B004EKYB7U|5|Great fit.
B00J4TW2SQ|4|Bike over all is wonderful.  The back of the frame came bent and I cannot attach my trunk because of it which is annoying to be unable to tie down the back rack.  The company is non existent after you receive your tao tao.  They'll be looking throguh their warehouse for months for you.
B001GJ3EJS|5|I use one of the brushes for cleaning wheels and wheel wells and the other for cleaning compounds/polishes/wax out of crevices. The bristles are soft enough to clean off grime and other stuff without scratching the paint. The pointed tip on the handle end of the brush is good for cracks and small spaces. Good sized brush for almost any job.
B00XVS8XNE|5|These work perfectly.
B001O0CBXO|5|yes good
B005NELVOM|5|Looks great in my 2012 Honda Accord
B001JT0EZ2|5|Great product. Seamless transaction.

B007V2DMGE|5|Works Great on my Lexus IS 250
B000Q8E5PC|5|Fantastic! Gained a ton of information I couldn't access before. Easy 5 minute install. Couldn't be happier!
B002M4GF38|5|These headlights fit perfect and look so much nicer than the original.
B00UAB12D8|3|Didn't work with 2002 Subar Outback, yes it recommends it for VWs, but I've discovered this cable uses a ch340t chip which is incompatible with the softwares (it recognizes the com ports but recieves a communication error) I've read that the readers with<br />ft232bl chips are compatible though.
B00K7938O4|5|Fits my frame, very clear, bought two so I can replace if fogs. Arrived on time, and well packaged.
B0049L1WM6|1|The hux nut was missing and I had to pay to return
B001XUD46S|5|very satisfied
B00GHT95EK|5|A OK
B00IZFNJ6Y|5|I really like it small and compact and acurate
B001XTLH1S|1|Took it to three different shops locally.  NONE of them would touch it.  All of them called it &#34;rough&#34; and &#34;garbage.&#34;  Wish I could return it, but obviously too late.  I can only recommend that NO ONE waste their money on this disposable junk.
B00D4LOXTG|1|Not as advertised. Not 7 1/2 inches. Flimsy mounting tape
B004RH68FS|5|excelente
B00EC0Z4XM|4|A little distorted but fit, functionality, and price was right.
B007LICL56|5|as much as I love these fasteners, they aren't quite long enough to secure the license frame on. we're still working on a work-around because I want to use them!
B00G52XEZU|5|It arrived quickly and fit great!
B009DJWSAE|3|Mounting brackets did not fit. I was forced to salvage my existing brackets.

B009S9RFXY|5|On my helmets. Can't tell it apart from factory stickers. Perfect.
B00JIGZXMC|5|Very happy this product.
B00REJX5BQ|5|The tonneau cover arrived quick and in good condition.  The cover itself was protected inside a cloth-like draw-string cover.  The only thing I would suggest to improve the product is to put something in the instructions for the light and the weather stripping.  There was no mention of the light (that comes with adhesive strips and velcro) and how to place it in the truck (although it does not take a brain surgeon to figure it out).  The weather stripping was included too but no instructions on where or how to apply it to the tail gate.  The tonneau cover itself appears to be a very good product. Will see how it holds up.
B004WPH8VS|5|Good stuff. Have no problem with it at all.
B00BD4YFO4|1|I hate them.already torn after one week.
B00N3PU22A|4|Look Q! and working good.
B00T0X61DS|1|Bad bad bad !  To big not the right cut I buy the box from the store and I intall it at the back glass off my pick up perfectly but this ones are a mess after they cut the paper its impossible to fix it and install it .
B00E25AJFK|5|Very nice addition to my V-Strom 1000. Has a great sound (especially with the baffles out). Power at mid range has a very noticeable increase. Bike just runs better in my opinion.
B001G4ZTVE|5|Brought for my husband as a Christmas gift and he loves them.
B003XJ9UR4|4|Installed this in to the front axle (Dana 30) my 1990 YJ when I did a gear change. I have about 500 miles on it so far but no real offroading  yet, I will update since I have a trip coming up soon.<br /><br />Why this one:<br />I bought this since instead of a true locker for a couple of reasons...<br /><br /> 1. I removed the axle disconnect and upgraded my front axles to TJ ones so the front diff is always spinning. So with this type of diff, it should not affect on road driving too much<br /><br />2. With a true locker, you are more likely to break stuff since you can really put all of your torque thru one tire and in my situation I put a 4BT diesel in my jeep and I also have a Klune V 4 to 1 crawl box added. If I'm in double low and put all of my torque thru one wheel, I will break something. I know I am sacrificing some capability on the trail but I think my drive line will last longer.<br /><br />3. I wheel with a buddy that has a Rubicon and he is always locking and unlocking front diff so he can make tight turns. This seems easy but he either forgets at first to unlock it so he does not make the turn or I end up waiting for him since it takes some time to unlock. Like I said, this is a little thing but when I'm wheeling, I have enough to think about.<br /><br />4. I did think about putting a posi in to get similar benefits but with a gear locker I won't smoke the clutches.<br /><br />Review:<br /> Its only been in for about 500 miles so far...<br />On road is great, I don't even know its up there. The only time I know its there is when I'm backing out of a parking spot with my wheel cranked. The tires will drag a little. But during regular driving she handles just like she did before with an open diff. So I'm happy with that!<br /><br />Off-road,I have not had a chance yet to put it thru its paces. I will be going to Rausch Creek in a couple of weeks and hitting the black trail where I broke my Dana 35 last time. With this up front and my new 8.8 out back I expect to finally finish a trip with out breaking. I'll update on how it performs.<br /><br />UPDATE 9/10/15<br />Did a long 3 day weekend at Rausch Creek. The diff performed great. I was able to do a lot more than before. In mud and with good tire speed it acted like it was locked. On heavy rocks crawing in double low (my crawl ratio is about 162 to 1) she would spin one wheel pretty easily but if I applied  some brake it locked right up nice and hard. I was able to climb rock shelves no problem...<br /><br />As for the toughness... It lasted the weekend but the diesel engine broke the main shaft either in my transfer case or the spud shaft in the Klune V. Either way it lasted longer than the drive train. I'm happy with it..PDATE 9/10/15 Did a long 3 day weekend at Rausch Creek. The diff performed great. I was able to do a lot more than before.

B005MZXSJ8|5|Great for the cars
B00556TP0A|5|Good value for flex fuel engines.
B00AE4U6T2|5|This has helped my 87 year old Mom find her keys several times.
B00X3M9URQ|2|I purchased 2 of these bulbs for my driving lights.  They looked great when I opened the package, but when I installed them it was a different story.  The first bulb was bright and fine, the second was dimmer than my old lights.  To me that's only a 50% success rate.<br />Yeah, they are inexpensive, but now I have to go look for another set.  That means I'll end up spending more money to get what I want.  Not good.
B0000AY2Z6|5|Quiet, moves air well and as reviewed by others, does not pull too much power. Draws were as reported by manufacturer.
B00Y5EBEOI|5|Great product excellent condition
B00E2TSPQQ|1|They are bright but the mounts broke after being on my truck 2 weeks
B000CRAUEM|5|I have this product for a year and a half now and have no complaints at all. I'm using it in my racing simulator cockpit and sent in a session almost 2 hours in a row and it really fells comfortable. It's easy to assemble and have all the required tools to do it. The instructions could be better explained but the illustrations helped.
B000E19EH0|5|Product works great. Highly recommend it.
B001NZZMA4|5|Have been using the ceramic fronts so I decided to give these a shot. AC Delco has yet to let me down on any product.
B000E0Z85I|5|Perfect fit on a 2003 Jeep Wrangler pre-10/2/03
B00F542DQU|4|Super bright for the price. Had a little trouble putting it into place because the shroud is plastic and would not stay attached to the light. Super glue would most likely keep it attached. But for the price you can't beat it!
B001GJ3DZS|5|Can't go wrong with this, works like it says!
B00IZG88MI|5|I have a 1995 American Dream RV needed a new radiator found this one by the part # . It was the perfect fit. The price was the best , quality made & fast shipping.
B000GROI28|5|Bought it for my husband's open face helmet, roomy enough for my full face. Should have bought two!!
B008NQL00W|5|Used when installing a Pioneer AppRadio 4. Worked perfectly. Lightweight w/ shrink wrapped. Been in my car for about a year no with no issue.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Simply brilliant.  I just ordered a second set.  Never lose your mobile phone or glasses at the traffic light again!
B00VLEIGVY|4|Unfortunately the light cover fills with water.
B002R2INO4|4|Works as advertised. The light is strong for the cost. My only qualm is that the cord is far too short.
B00CQD4BUE|5|Quality piece. A definite must buy for all first Gen mini owners
B005J68N9A|5|Fast delivery. ..love to support my brothers in Blue. ...
B000C3ZD0M|5|works like it should have had it on for a while now and still works
B001V8U12M|5|This is so much better then using the hand crank.
B00407NK6A|5|Works great!
B00O4LYVRY|4|Really nice muffler Opened up my system I thought it would be a little quieter with the built in resonator but nope very loud and aggressive tone sounds great especially when you step on it throaty little raspy but nothing crazy
B000C59SJ2|1|There black not white shocks. Anyway I put these on my 1984 bronco 2 that was sagging as typical. They have leaked from day one. Mechanic for 27 years. Sprayed everything down with soap must be a pin hole. Stay up for a day that's it. So damn aggravating I got screwed. Invest in good stuff do not buy these cheap pos.
B004TOB6EW|4|I just received the 15 gallon model, haven't had it out in the field yet. The unit is a solid plastic and the wheels look strong as well.  They say you can tow it behind your tow vehicle, using the attachment.  You'd have to go very slow or you're going to bounce that puppy all over the place.  I plan on putting it in the back, I may have to create some kind of ramp for it.<br /><br />The waste hose is a 3&#34; diameter hose but there is only one Valterra style connector on it. The other end of the hose is just plain Jane, no attachment.  That's fine because the hose is about 1.5 feet long.  The video says 3' but not for this unit. I'm going to take it to my trailer in the storage lot and see how well it fits but I'll probably have to buy another length of hose for it, along with a fitting and clamp. The shorty waste hose and 1 foot wash hose with fittings will fit in the little storage compartment.  Most dump stations don't have a fitting on the hose so this might be useful only at home or at the camp site.<br /><br />This unit does have the metal bar carrier.  It's loose, just slides under the handle then the other end has a loop to go over the hitch ball.  There 's no place you can attach this carrier bar to the transport, like the larger models have.  You'll have to store it someplace else and remember where you put it when the time comes.<br /><br />But the unit does look solid, I think it'll fit my needs, just have to maybe modify the waste hose.
B00504MVHQ|5|Fit like OEM. Price is excellent.
B00KJGPMZI|5|Amazing!  Great sound quality!  Can listen to Pandora or radio, and the intercom or GPS will work over it!  Super cool!  I didn't even think I wanted one & now I love it!
B003VKUPE2|4|This was just the wrong part I had no problems with the shipping or the product
B000GKD5NI|5|Works well with keeping the sun off baby and keeping the car seat cool.
B00JQYNMRY|5|I use this in an RV toilet. I love the stuff. It cleans excellent without very little effort. It will not miss with the additive in the black tank. However: I bought mine from an RV dealer and paid about 7.00 for a bottle. Not sure why this on Amazon is so high. Product works.
B00MMLIXPO|1|can't get it to work!!
B00IBOLYFC|5|Truly great product.  Fits so precisely, looks like it came from factory.  Durable, easy to clean, and looks great.

B00CGGXQV6|5|Fit my 2015 Chevrolet 2500 SB perfectly. Lower price & better quality than the one I bought 10 years ago for my F150.<br /><br />Follow the instructions and you'll do fine.
B004WMDVDU|5|I'm very happy with my purchase
B000C2WF9A|2|seems cheaply made and brakes easy.
