B008MIMWOO|4.0|I am not a huge Mike Meyers fan. To be honest, though I loved Wayne's World. This is a must have for those who like Kitchy comedies. While a parody of sorts of James Bond flicks, like Undercover Brother, it basically tells its own story adding enough personal flavor, that it really isn't parody anymor as much as it is its own thing. One thing I should add (as I always like to hear the details as much as I can). The first copy I bought myself was a slip cover with three slimline cases (not bad, even though I prefer normal blu ray size cases not slims). And the second I purchased for a friend has one case with three discs in it. I am not sure if it's exactly the same  as the first as I can't open it as it's a gift lol. But, it all depends on what you like most.<br /><br />As for the movies, I still feel if you take the best gags from all three movies you can have one  hell of a great movie. The movies are a bit slow in pace for a standard parody and seems to tell it's own unique store (so it balances out). The humor is crude and suggestive (as one might expect) but it's never raunchy enough to get an R (which I would not care if it did actually). The casting is great and the power women (as opposed to Bond women) are lethal but doubles as sweet eye candy. Overally even if you have seen these movies and only like maybe one it's still a great price. So I wouldn't pass it up. If you like british-like humor or if you like bizarre action comedies you will not want to let this one get away (before they raise the price). each movie has it's own flavor...and the worst jokes are not horrible by any stretch. But I've seen these types of movies for many many years, so a movie needs to be more than crude to get a laugh from me. Some of the raunchy humor is well crafted while others seem like Benny Hill joke rejects.<br /><br />I may be sounding too critical, so I should add, this is great for any collection. but be careful of what you are getting used to. though it's not R it's still not really something anyone under 15 should be watching. So overally I'd have to say it's something that I can appreciate more now then before (as there was too much hoopla/build up that by the time i actually got to see it, I was expecting too much. But looking at them now, they are fine and can still make me laugh (but if you get bored by too much potty language or junior high school type jokes then this isn't for you. But if you are cool with that, then you'd want to check these out if you haven't already.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Nice story felt a bit rushed at the end maybe she wrote it with a movie in mind - never did figure out where the long lost sibling went to

B009DH371K|5.0|First let me get my one gripe out of the way. Why do record labels insist on this eco-friendly packaging crap? Give me a sturdy/standard case (a 3 disc case is easy to put out) I do not plan on throwing away my cd/dvd cases so why make them eco friendly or biodegradable, make them strong and I'll be happy. This isn't anything that can take away from the five stars though. I will admit I love Queen and Freedie's vocals has to be one of the greatest vocalists of all time. That being said, I'm sure most of you probably agree to some degree otherwise you would not be reading further.<br /><br />The blu ray looks and sounds great. I have never seen this on dvd or in any other incarnation so my opinion is just based on what I have in front of me. And trust me, if there was anything to gripe about I'd gripe lol. Because I hold Queen in such high esteem I'd want them presented in the best possible way.  Also anyone who has the Wembley dvd, do not worry, though most of the tracks are the same, the sound/performance is difference. It's like a totally new feeling. And I wish they'd come out with Wembley as well on Blu Ray. So if you are worried about it just being a duplicate of that one, do not worry this is a definite must have.<br /><br />The songs themselves sound great and are well chosesn, as this is part of the Magic tour, it makes sense that it mirrors the Wembley arena one. The two cds are also great to have as well. I did not see the discs available seperate from the dvd, if it is ti's not remastered etc, so This was the best way to go. Though I like the cases like a standard blu ray comes in, they could have added a few little trays in the middle. I'm sorry but I just hate the packaging lol. The book/cover art is great though do not get me wrong..and I am not disappointed with my purchase (as there isn't a better alternative). Though it was a bit pricey, I can't see any real Queen fan really caring about that.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the songs, but weall know them and they sound great live. I will add a point or two about Freddie, as this was the last tour he had with Queen. He simply owns his audience. Getting that huge of a stadium to clap rhythmically as a single entity is no small fete. He has them eating out of the palms of his hands. There is no air of arrogance mind you, just control. The audience loves Freddie and he loves them. It's like magic (pardon the pun) when he's on stage and they are so in tune with him. He looks comfortable on the stage and energized. He feeds off their love as if it's adrenaline.<br /><br />The small documentary is a bit short at 27 minutes, and I believe I've seen bits of it in the behind the scenes of the Wembley DVD and/or Queen BBC documentary (another must have for fans). But it's still great to have. for the value of this Blu Ray and two cd set, I can't put a price on it, aside from the choice of cases I can't complain about anything. So if you love Queen or just good old fashioned Live rock 'n roll bands then you need this. Not just want, need. To many artists lip synch these days, this is a band at the top. Queen has never been a band of unequal players (think Wham!) Everyone contributes and everyone supports each other. Both in the music and the songwriting, that's probably why Queen is still so popular. No one can deny their talent, not after seeing this.
B009H442DG|5.0|I LOVE these two and was so happy to see them back together again!! It was wonderful to have their music fill our holidays! I opened this as a gift on Christmas morning, but it will be played every Christmas from here on out!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This is the best movie that I have seen in a long time. The story is exceptional, embodying elements of a crime drama, a western, an action movie, a sci-fi thriller, and a morality tale. The acting, direction, and cinematography are excellent. Joseph Gordon-Levitt deserves an Oscar for his performance, and Emily Blunt is nearly as good. These are two of the finest young actors in modern cinema, giving among the best performances of their careers, in a complex and satisfying movie. Most movies nowadays leave me bored. Not this one. I highly recommend it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It has been a great tool for me and my son to use.  My tablet is full of school cool stuff and was missing these!
B006O3MU96|5.0|I like this game even though I am no good at it.  The graphics and sounds are cute. The controls are simply. Just tilt the device the direction you want to move.  It works great on my 10&#34; tablet.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|Mom, dad and 11yr old son all love this movie. It is hilarious! Stays pretty true to the book. Although my son loves the movies he did say the books are better because there's more left to the imagination. But this is a must purchase if you love the books.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book.  Sometimes I'm disappointed by a book or movie if it has a lot of buzz but this was a good read. I like the way she writes as it's a normal dialog and not a bunch of over imaginative wording to sound like a spectacular writer.  The characters are real and what you would expect a naive young girl to do if put in that situation.  I know because I was one of those girls back in the day.<br /><br />CL Cloud Author Indian Summer<br />[[ASIN:B00AWDB3TW Indian Summer]]

B00A8KJK7G|3.0|For the past few years, many have wondered if Tim Burton had lost his mojo. Critics and fans alike did not take warmly to his last few releases (although general audiences ate up 'Alice In Wonderland'). I am a die hard Tim Burton fan, and I agree that his recent output was just not good enough. When I first heard and then saw the trailer for 'Frankenweenie', I started to feel positive again. Could it be that Burton has found his way again? Does the movie deliver on classic Tim Burton? Read on....<br /><br />'Frankenweenie' follows the tale of young Victor Frankenstein. He makes homes movies, has a taste for science and, most obviously, loves his dog, Sparky. Victor is crushed when Sparky is taken from him following an accident. Thanks to science class and his teacher, Victor gets the idea on how to bring his beloved Sparky back to life. Once he succeeds, and his secret is revealed to a few fellow students, the town is overrun with horrendous versions of animals brought back to life in a monster mash showdown.<br /><br />Based on Burton's 1984 live action short of the same name, the movie expands on that story and creates new characters, situations, and action to reach feature film length. The result is a loving and enjoyable homage to classic monster movies, made even more complete and authentic with the film being in glorious black and white. Obviously, \\"Frankenstein\\" is the key influence here, but with the generic looking suburb the movie takes place in, it also feels a bit like Burton's own \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" (it doesn't hurt that two 'Edward' actors, Winona Ryder and Conchatta Ferrell, supply voices here). Beyond just being a monster movie, the film is about a boy and his dog and, despite the macabe subject matter, is very much a warm hearted movie. Something you don't see too much of anymore. I dare anyone not to be moved by this, or even maybe feel teary eyed at moments. I know I was!<br /><br />Supplying the voices here are a number of Tim Burton regulars:Martin Short (Mars Attacks!), Catherine 'O' Hara (Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas), Winona Ryder (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands), and Martin Landau (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). Even though Christopher Lee, who has featured in numerous Burton films doesn't voice here, he does make an appearance thanks to TV footage.<br /><br />While \\"Frankenweenie\\" may not reach the incredible highs of classic Burton, It's the best offering he has given us in years. That being said, one still comes away with the feeling that he and his fellow filmmakers didn't take it as far as they very well could have. The homages to monster movies and characters (love the kid who sounds like Peter Lorre) are great, and the movie is a brilliantly done piece of work. It's soft viewing for the youngsters, and entertaining for adults and fans of Burton. It's fun, it's nostalgic, it's warm hearted. It's been a long time since Burton has delivered a film this good. It's definitely a step back on the right track for Tim Burton.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved this book because there were so many crazy twists. I never saw some of the twists coming. Definitely one of the better books out there.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|My son loves this game, good job to the developers! Thank you we like the game very much! Great work!
B005LAII80|5.0|I have loved the black humor and ultra-violence of Judge Dredd since the 80's when I started reading British comics (thank you 2000 AD!!!).  Forget the Stallone abomination, this movie does the character justice.<br />Dredd is a superb sci-fi action movie (with some deeper meaning if you want to look further). Don't miss out on one of the best movies of the year, no...one of the best movies ever. It's that good.  Props to Karl Urban for NOT taking the helmet off. He obviously is a fan of the source material and does a wonderful job portraying this legendary character. PLEASE MAKE A SEQUEL...I want to see the \\"Judge Death\\" storyline done in the same style. You think there was some crazy (insert expletive) in this movie? You ain't even scratched the surface of the Dredd universe.<br />One word summation for this franchise: MORE!
B009VB9VKY|2.0|Pic quality was very bad. Movie was depressing. Nice to see men dancing around in skimpy clothes. But could not see picture very clear.

B0050N8N0Q|5.0|If they didn't they should have. Fantastic album with songs that you never get tired of playing. Such a good album, it's hard to pick a fave but if you're undecided check out &#34;Houdini&#34;, &#34;I would do anything for love&#34; or &#34;Pumped up Kicks&#34;

B009RI4FRU|4.0|It's a good original story that adds something new to films in general with funny and unusual characters. It has a refreshing complexity.
B00632HWOG|1.0|This app is a nightmare!! I had put in a previous review about it because my yahoo was hacked right after I used this app. Well that wasnt the end of it. I also got some lovely porn chat spam texted to me as well. DO NOT USE THIS APP!!!
1612680011|5.0|I received this book as a gift not too long ago and had expected a way to get rich or something similar. It was a shock to me how it was not what i expected. This book was a great read teaching not just about money but also about life lessons. Teaching me how fear and emotions can control decisions and keep you in the \\"rat race.\\" This book opened my eyes and changed my perspective on life. It is helping me focus and work everyday for my goals.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This was a good lazy day read.  I wanted to keep reading to see what would happen.  It was a book for thought after reading to see if I could be that stong.  I learned flowers are so much more to me now.
B0013F1D02|3.0|It's a little silly, but not too bad to watch. There's a solid plot and a strong protagonist. The witches are fun to watch.
0547569653|5.0|Ultramarathon enthusiast was very happy to receive this as a gift. Scott Jurek is well known for his achievements in the ultra marathon world.  Hopefully there will be valuable information in it for the recipient.
0440245206|2.0|Bought this because it's Danielle Steel so kept reading just one more chapter knowing it would pick up.  It didn't!  It didn't even have some redeeming value to make up for the dragging storyline. Really? Mom and Dad applaud her boyfriend moving in with her at 21 while everyone agrees she's much too young to think of marriage? on what planet?! Characters seemed cardboard - not real.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This is a great first CD. I can't believe I waited so long to buy it. I have noticed that music is have a resurgence of folk music with modern twists. It's a collectable for sure!
0061992860|4.0|This guide is packed to the brim with survival tips. It's smaller than I imagined though! It will fit in the palm of your hand, or pocket, but it doesn't mean it's not packed with great information.<br /><br />It even has pictures, diagrams, and other great things to help you be a Bear Grylls impersonator.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. Easy to use. Word of God right at your fingertips any time of day or night.<br />Love it!
0345803485|4.0|An unusual escape into someone's personal world that I would never see in my own life relationships.  Interesting the control that switches.  I am not sure I will read the other books.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Clever, suspenseful novel.  The wife's capacity and patience for vengeance is staggering, made it a real page-turner.  I was however very disappointed in the ending.  This was not because I didn't like decisions made by the characters, but because the book just STOPPED.  I'm hoping this is because the author plans on making a sequel, in which case I will definitely read it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Really very funny. Read it, gift it, love it. I've reread it twice and I am still snarfing out loud.
B009FXIICK|4.0|I love this game.  The competition can be fierce and frustrating, but it give you a competitive challenge, and forces you to get better.  I wish they would allow items for sale
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The stand was my favorite book until this one. I literally couldn't put it down and when I did, all I thought about was the book and getting back to read it. Was sad when it ended. Bittersweet ending. Guess I'll just have to read it again.
0547258305|4.0|I don't think this is necessarily for very young kids. There is an intense scene at the end, which may be considered graphic adult content depending on how conservative you are.  The book itself was very interesting to read. I thought the story flowed quickly. The character was a strong female presence. She knew what she wanted and lived in an interesting world, which was both surreal and believable. I found myself rooting for her and wondering how she would make it out of the various predicaments she found herself in.  After I read this, I bought the next 2 in series. I found this was the best though so far.  This is a mature young adult book.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Colin Farrell was great, but the movie just wasn't as good as the original.  It was too dark.  They changed the story line a bit, but it was still similiar.  Maybe they should have changed it completely so that comparisons weren't drawn?
0307887448|5.0|I am very picky about what I read. I pick this book, read the back and was intrigued (which doesn't happen often!). Started reading it thinking I would probably put it down and forget about it but was I wrong! I love this book. The character and dialogue felt real. It made me want to play the games in the book. Read from cover to cover! Love it and I can not wait for your next one Cline!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I wish I had someone tell me I needed to read this book when I was young. Having read it for the first time as an adult, there is so much that would have related to me as a teenager. Couldn't put it down, and can't wait to read the rest of them.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I've never had so much feeling for a character until I stumbled upon the story of Khovthe. This book is more his childhood and growing up as an incredibley intelligent youth grasping onto almost all concepts with ease.  Not much action as this is laying a massive foundation for the kingkiller chronicles but wow it goes in depth. Gets to the point where this is a real world you are steeping into not just some fantasy story it's very believable and the character development is like nothing i have read.  Read this book.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|No doubt about it, Steve Jobs was an interesting person; a genius man child.  Walter Isaacson makes Jobs' life fascinating by detailing the characters surrounding Jobs' work and the historical backdrop of Silicon Valley.  Since I am an Apple fan, owning all the latest and greatest technology from the start, I felt I should know about the man behind the development and design.  I'm glad I read the book.
0812550706|5.0|This is a great book! I move books that keep you wanting more and this one of them. I just finished the second book in the series and ready for the next. Ender's game doesn't disappoint. Highly recommend reading.

B004HO6I4M|5.0|Our immediate family watched Rio together right before Christmas 2012, it was a riot!! we laughed and danced! have never done that with another movie, ever! Grandson (4) asks for it everyday. A masterpiece!!!
B002RVCD0U|3.0|The theme hadn't changed much. Man fighting against sentient machines in a post apocalyptic landscape. And of course it being a prequel you kinda know whats gonna happen it is just the manner in which everything plays out. The surprise here is the origin of the Terminator sent to rub out John Conner, the rest is really eye candy and special effects. So if you are looking for some good CGI which a not-to-complicated plot/story and are a fan of the Terminator Franchise, this one is for you!
B005LAII12|5.0|the movie was extremely funny and the whole family enjoyed it we all got together and had a few good laughs this was a fun movie to watch and i would recommend it other friends

B005544V6A|5.0|Clearly, fascinating characters with interesting personalities, such as Lewis, Mike, Donna, etc. I'm intrigued with the excessive egos and the combo of competence/incompetence displayed throughout the series.

1451696191|1.0|Cramming Go Ask Alice, The Breakfast Club, The Bell Jar and a few Jerry Springer episodes into one story may make for MTV ratings (everyone loves an occasional train wreck) but it does not make for a very realistic depiction of the average (or even exceptional) teenager's plight. Post-modern, teenage Job, Charlie was combating so many different &#34;challenges&#34; at one time that it was often hard to nail each one down.  The writing was so full of cliches, I was half-disappointed when none of the drug-induced characters stood on the open edge of high-rise window and yelled, &#34;I can fly!&#34;  I never did witness the said &#34;improvement&#34; that Charlie's English teacher recognized in his writing but I prayed with every page that Chbosky would save us with a &#34;Flowers for Algernon&#34; style rescue. My prayers went unanswered.  You deserve better.  Might I suggest &#34;Black Swan Green&#34; by David Mitchell. It's a well-crafted, sincere depiction of coming of age (complete with sentences that will make your heart sing).you're looking for an honest depiction of coming of age complete with sentences that will make your heart sing, I'd pick up Black Swan Green by David Mitchell. It's writing alone leaves \\"Wallflower\\" so far in the dust that I risk blasphemy by referencing them both in the same sentence.

B009UMTMKS|4.0|Someone I know online introduced me to Steve Blank and his &#34;lean startup&#34; concepts. Before that, I'd never heard of him or his concepts. Before I started reading this book, I attended an online course that explained the concepts. I was glad I did that first because it gave me a good foundation for reading the book.<br /><br />I'm almost halfway through the book. I already have *tons* of highlights and several notes. This book and its concepts have caused me to entirely rethink my business model planning. While I've been quite impressed with the book so far, there are a couple of things I think could be improved upon.<br /><br />I like the fact that Blank includes information for those starting businesses in the web/mobile channel and not just information for those working in the physical channel. However, he sometimes switches between the two and that gets a little confusing on occasion.<br /><br />Secondly, I think sometimes Blank repeats information. I think he could have cut that down a bit. Lastly, the book seems a little long to me. If it wasn't for these items I would have rated this book five stars. Those items aren't huge detriments and I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis do a fantastic job in this futuristic thrill ride. One struggles to save his future as the other fights to preserve his past and prevent losing the one he loves.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is convenient and easy to view with its big numbers. Used it in the store to add purchases and used it to balance checkbook.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app. It shows how much I have  left and it is free can't get this  better get app it is the best.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read it all in one afternoon, loved it and I'm 29. Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book was just ok. I got it on the recommendation of someone who had read it. I guess it just wasn't really my thing.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game gets 5 stars! This game is super addicting! When you lose, it will give you the urge to play again and beat your high score! Recommended for any age. No flaws at all.
B002SLNK5G|5.0|Great, great, great series! Acting is phenomenal and characters are spot on. I watched the 3rd and 4th season growing up and never had the chance to watch the first season till now. I gave it a shot and was very happy I did. Better than most of the stuff on today.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Fantastic. Better than Part 1. I can't believe they actually pulled this off, while remaining so close to the source material. Really impressed.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This book was great.  Well written, well researched, and surprisingly sentimental about a topic that could easily have been discussed clinically.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is really addicting and fun. Leave it overnight, you get SO many coins! Recommended for all ages. You won't regret it!
B0035RFYT2|5.0|My Partner Anne is a wolf-person and this was a wolf figurine she didn't have.  Well, she does now and she is quite happy with it.<br />Quality of construction: Excellent.  Quality of coloring, Excellent (maybe the teeth could have been a bit better done, but they're tiny to begin with).  Material: Plastic/Resin something.  It's strong and I don't see anything breaking in the foreseeable future.<br />Even the tag is superior!  Great work, Schleich!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|When I got the latest update, it slowed my phone down considerably. Now it force closes about every time I use it. I uninstalled it and now the whole phone works much better. I loved the older version much better. I might consider coming back if they would fix the bugs. I love the ability to read my books on my Android. Guess I'll have to go with Google books for now.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game!!!!!! I purchased the free game got so addicted I could not put it down. so I splurged and spent the shoe 2.99 loo to keep playing. I highly reccomend this game.
B009CPES4I|5.0|This was a heartwarming story of how we are never too old to discover new things and more importantly change ourselves for the better if we want to.  I loved this movie.
B004GXHOGK|5.0|What he isn't: A repainted small German shepherd with a fluffy tail.  This little guy is a fox with a capital F.<br />Examples of the quality of this casting:  The feet have pads, not flats. His fur is the right shade of orange-red shading to white on his underbelly and brown on his legs (Socks, as the term goes).  His inner ears are white with a darker brown outer lining.<br />His tail is white underneath.  All this is flat (as in flat paint).  His eyes are properly gold with slit pupils, not round ones and they are glossy (as they should be).  His nose is gloss brown (as it should be) rather than black.<br />The detail in this figurine (mis-called a toy) is incredible.<br />And yes, he's a Todd (masculine) and not a Vixen.<br />Superb in every sense of the word.  Kudos, Schleich!
0765325950|1.0|I have purchased every book in this series, starting when a student introduced them to me in 2002.  I've had this date marked in my calendar for months and was ready to download the book the day it came out only to read the reviews that the ebook would not be released until April, in the expectation that we readers would be so desperate that we would instead purchase the hard copy.  Ridiculous.  I would have paid the full price for the ebook but will not buy the hard copy.  So instead of gouging us you have instead managed to encourage us to use our public and school libraries.  I hate it that the author will suffer for the publisher's greed.  Perhaps when we are actually able to read the book we will be able to add a review for the book itself.  In the meantime, TOR, rethink your policy!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Cute and fun.  I have a few issues with the game freezing occasionally but still fun.  Cant go wrong<br />for a free game
B009FB3XTA|5.0|None of the soundtrcks have disappointed me. I bought all the soundtracks & this one is my favorite. Each song is different yet catchy.
B0063GORYU|4.0|love the easy tap to play. find the ads annoying, but that is par with free games. worth the download.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|This was purchased as a Christmas give and was a lot smaller than thought.  Have been told that it is a fun game to play!
B00A757EFW|4.0|This is so nostalgic for me and now my kids get to play it! Easy to play, too! I recommend for fans of the original PACMAN.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|When watching \\"Red Riding Hood,\\" the 2011 teen-angst horror fantasy, I couldn't help but remember those snow globes so popular around Christmas time. Shake it and a raging blizzard swirls around a miniature cabin. The isolated, Medieval community in \\"Red Riding Hood\\" is comprised of similar gingerbread homes covered by a stylish dusting of snow. Obviously an extraordinary set, domestic melodramas are accented by breath-taking helicopter shots of forbidding mountains due north of Vancouver. This is a world of daydream imagination, and director Catherine Hardwicke's long-time roots as a set designer on such films as [[ASIN:B000ICII5O Vanilla Sky]] and [[ASIN:B003SI84D6 Tombstone]] are readily apparent.<br /><br />There's a fine line one has to walk when forging such fantasy, and \\"Red Riding Hood\\" stumbles on the trail too often. It's clear this is a variation of rural Europe, the land of Germanic [[ASIN:1480270253 Grimm's Fairy Tales]] (\\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" also has roots in 17th century French folklore), and yet characters speak with San Fernando Valley accents. There's even a huge iron elephant used for torturous confessions, a peculiar device said in the film to be borrowed from \\"The Romans.\\" Okay, but the Romans were an actual historic civilization. If Hardwicke is attempting to create a fantastic middle earth, perhaps one should not reference reality? The entire film suffers haphazard missteps, eroding the creative vision filmmakers were hoping to achieve.<br /><br />The Little Red Riding Hood of this film is not so little. In fact, she's teenage beauty Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) bouncing between advances of a couple of hunks. Her heart belongs to Peter (Shiloh Fernandez), a woodcutter rebel who dresses in black. But she's been promised to Henry (Max Irons), a son of wealth whose father, I don't know, sells wood? The snow globe village, as isolated as Dracula's castle, suffers from monthly appearances of a werewolf on nights of the full moon. Villagers providean animal sacrifice, usually an unlucky pig chained to a stump, so the canine menace avoids residents.<br /><br />After years of uneasy co-existence, the werewolf unexpectedly kills Valerie's sister, and a warrior priest is invited to town to flush out the menace. Yes, this priest is played by Gary Oldman, a cloak-wearing variation of Witchfinder General Matthew Hopkins, replete with bodyguards adorned in crossbows. Oldman has a grand time in one of the film's highlights, possessing all the subtlety of Vincent Price. Oh yes, suspicious residents are thrown into the already-mentioned elephant to garner werewolf confessions. There shall be no spoilers, suffice to say absolutely everyone is a suspect, including Valerie's mother (Virginia Madsen), father (Billy Burke), grandmother (Julie Christie) and the coifed hunks vying for her heart.<br /><br />Oddly, I felt a sense of depression when watching Christie deliver ridiculous lines while baking cookies in her isolated cabin. There was a time when she was our greatest living actress, a mesmerizing talent in [[ASIN:B0070DY26I Petulia]], [[ASIN:B003Y3U8OS McCabe & Mrs.Miller]] and \\"Heaven Can Wait.\\" A remnant of an incredible golden age in film, she's now reduced to playing hippie grandma in a teen flick. Oh well, life's a long and winding road with unforeseen turns.<br /><br />At one time, Hardwicke was a promising talent who burst upon the scene with insightful and courageous films detailing America's youth ([[ASIN:B000I9VZHA Thirteen]], [[ASIN:B000I9VXR2 Lords of Dogtown]]). And then she directed [[ASIN:B001T5D6LK Twilight]], making saddle bags of money for all involved. \\"Red Riding Hood,\\" with teens in love, werewolves, spiked trees and a nice Goth tune here and there, is an attempt to recreate that box office success. I think America's bored youth will like it, but the story is plot heavy and obsessively derivative, with too busy elements barely held together by balls of twine. I can't imagine how anyone could keep from laughing.<br /><br />There's some great shots of Valerie, with flowing red cape hiking along dangerous snowy mountain tops. I also loved the town's pagan festival where dancers tip-toed through fire while splashing mugs of beer, a raging celebration that would make  Lord Summerisle of [[ASIN:B002QCD2OG The Wicker Man (1973)]] proud. But such rustic magic has all the depth of an MTV video, albeit one with interesting images. It's a shame the film's screenplay was not equally fleet of foot.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I am a Nelson DeMille fan and was excited to read his latest book. It started out in true Demille fashion but quickly fizzled. The bulk of the book had no action and was very wordy in detailing aspects of Yemen, and the CIA . Nothing happened until the climax and by that time you knew what was going to happen and happy that the read was over.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Love this series but was a little upset at ending. Overall it was a great story & I enjoyed reading it.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Reliable.  Use it every day.  Doesn't crash, can add multiple alarms.  Bought the full version to eliminate ads.  Good buy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|addictive so many games it is a teaser but its 101 teasers It needs more ways to get points easier
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a frustrating game I can't put down because I hate to lose! I find I want to do just one level but wind up doing more because it challenges me so much.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|the best!<br />its relly fun cant stop playing :) looooooooooove it. :p / / / / / / / /
0307592731|2.0|This is a book about self pity. I was given this book because of my own plans to hike the PCT. Very little of the book relates to her actual physical trek. Instead, you are witness to her self-destructive behavior and her attempts to escape the chaos brought on by her bad choices and her mother's death. I cannot relate to her because while she may be intelligent (as she continually tells us), she makes stupid decisions. I see no redeeming qualities and find her personally loathsome and unusually self-absorbed. In the epilogue, she relates that she is now married with two children. My reaction was to pity them. I hope she has straightened her life out for the sake of the kids. I gave it two stars because while I didn't like it, it was written well enough to keep me engaged to the end.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Perplexus Epic was the most used gift on Christmas Day. Everyone had tons of fun being challenged by this toy. Ages 6 to 86 all played and had a great time. Not one of us has made it to the end yet, but it is great fun trying.<br /><br />Awesome toy for eye hand coordination and mental stimulation.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love this because I can tune in to the local police channel, too. I work at a hospital so knowing when there is going to be an ambulance arriving at our door helps me know when I need to see if the nursing staff needs assistance with phones, etc.
B00A03WBVI|5.0|This album was the best thing I've ever heard these boys are so very talented and make each day brighter after listening to it!!
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I have to say that I never write reviews. I had to write a review on this app though. I have two kids who enjoy the Rayman Origins game on PS3. I purchased this app just to see if it was anything close to the game. This app is great! My kids love it!! It is very close to our PS game, levels are fun and controls are easy. I highly recommend this purchase.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Easy reading and entertaining.  Wanted it to go on ended abruptly-  The domestic abuse is hard to stomach but we need to open our eyes to it !
B008BGNMZU|4.0|This album is not Four Play's best, but I still like it.  It is very listenable, and you will find it good background music.
B00006AW2L|5.0|I love the rolling  stones.I love paint it black I love it my all time favorite song next to have you ever seen the rain I love it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Not being one to read crime/courtroom dramas, I was a little skeptical at first, thought the book  would be unrealistic or too predicatable.. but the author was a master at developing the mystery, the characters and the doubt in the reader's mind ...Who is present ? Who is not?  The confusion of the timeline adds to the sense of uneasiness as we try to sort out our own feelings, suppostions and loyaties. I saw some similarities to &#34;We Need to Talk About Kevin&#34; ...there is an underlying sense of evil, lurking very close to the surface, can we trust the narrarator, do we sympathize with the devil?<br />And then, at the end (no spoilers here), what do WE do now.....<br />Good book, good issues to discuss.....Go for it..
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Not only is Mila Kunis and Mark Wahlberg a very sexy combination, but the added voice and humor of Seth McFarland makes this hysterical. If you like Family Guy and American Dad type of humor, you will love this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is worth every penny I spent you can build, accessorize and protect yourself from monsters.I would definitely recommend this game to people who love to build and design.
B008M721MS|2.0|I needed the country code to add my phone number to the registration-wish I'd known nice app but not worth the time!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Read one or two newer Lee Child books and thought I would start at the beginning of the series.  So I am working my way from 1 to whatever is latest.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This intimate look into the experiences of an Alzheimer sufferer and her family is written with empathy and love by Lisa Genova.  As in all her novels, she explains the condition in easily understandable terms. Having just lost my beloved mother-in-law with Lewy Body Dementia, I could understand the feelings of Alice's family and to a certain extent, what Alice was feeling and experiencing as well.
B009VL28W2|5.0|So hot to see a show on a dvd when you just been here, we feel again the emotion and the energy WOW !
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this game-simple, exciting and it has helped me get better with the touch screen on my kindle.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Read one or two newer Lee Child books and thought I would start at the beginning of the series.  So I am working my way from 1 to whatever is latest.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly is THE BEST and continues to write outstanding novels which hold your interest and intrigue throughout the book<br />A winner
B0063IH60K|3.0|I was excited when I saw Solitare, so quickly added to my Kindle.  It is fun to play, the only downside is the ads that pop up with no way of closing.  Of course the Kindle is all new to me, so maybe I just have not figured out that piece yet.<br /><br />Yes I would recommend if you can deal with the ads.
B001SF8G1Q|5.0|This sounds like different Dylan...but by no means bad Dylan...it's great.  I usually don't like just sitting and listening to music...but I do with this.  I feel like I'm watching a movie almost.
0765325950|5.0|This conclusion to the series is an excellent and very enjoyable read, though a little bittersweet as all endings are.  The only positive aspect to the ending of this series is the - now closer! - release of Sanderson's 2nd Way of Kings.<br /><br />That said, I rarely leave reviews for books but was driven to in this case because of the number of 1 star reviews this book is getting.  My husband and I have been fans of WoT for years.  We have anxiously awaited each release of the book and bought them as soon as they were available, in whatever format they were available.  Release dates of all versions of the book have been available, people should have been prepared.<br /><br />Also, I want to say, people who buy hardcover books are not dinosaurs, nor are they stuck in the past.  A book is about more than the story, its about the smell, the weight and the feel of a book.  Kindles, Nooks, Kobos, they all serve a purpose, and yes they are convenient, but they will never, in my mind, replace a physical copy of any story.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|This is so much better than any of the performances on The Song Remains The Same.  You can tell that they are all well rehearsed and they are not so inebriated that they can't play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is not exactly like the computer but it is really close. Minecraft is the greatest game EVER since 2000 I recommend that you buy this app. believe me and then buy this app please!!!
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Absolutely amazing...I can't tell if I like classic Bob Dylan or his new blues/folk voice better.  I think I like it all.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I understand  the desire for players to link accounts, but when it completely haults progress, that is a tad off. We have the wireless disabled on our kids Kindle, so when it ask her to connect to a social network she can't. Yes you can skip this by spending a few gems, which are hard to come by in the game, unless you want to spend real money on them......for a kids game, no way. Aside from the required social aspect I like that my daughter can play the game and see all her favorite characters from the tv show, and the pony/shop interaction is great. Fix the &quot;required&quot; social element and it would be 5star game. Some parents don't let their kids have free rain on the internet, sorry.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We watched the first two season's on Netflix and wanted to be caught up by the time the series resumes in February.  Thanks for providing this option for us.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was not disappointed with this end to The Hunger Games! I could not tear myself away. It kept me on the edge of my seat.
B000XT1P3E|5.0|What can I say?  I love both movies, I had Erin Brockovich already, but I wanted it in DVD.  All Julia Roberts movies are together in my entertainment center, so I could  see them, pick them with ease.  I love the extra features, how they were made,  all the &#34;special futures&#34;<br />As usual, shipping was on time, and in excellent condition.<br />If you like to have a good time at the movies, see Julia Roberts movies!
B001E75QH0|1.0|This item was advertised as the COMPLETE collection of Indiana Jones movies (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Temple of Doom, Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull).  When it arrived, I found that it contained the first 3 movies and a fourth DVD of &#34;Bonus Material&#34;.  As it was intended as a gift for my dad, I promptly returned it.  I subsequently found all 4 movies (separately) at Target for roughly half the price of this set.  I will give Amazon credit for being very understanding and helpful with the return process - this was the first item I ordered from Amazon that was not all that was advertised.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I can only say I loved it!  Couldn't put it down! It's a great story and wonderfully written,loved the characters.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Excellent writing and plot. Completely original and full of suspense. I can't wait for the next book to come out!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|How does Ken Follett do it?? He weaves these most incredible tales, where we follow characters over a century.  He is such an amazing writer....
B006AN78XS|5.0|If you like historical fiction, and love the arts this if a fun movie to watch.  It makes me miss nostalgia!
0894803123|5.0|we got a softserve icecream maker & saw this book, we have tried several & everyone is better than the last. this is a must have if you own your own maker.  its much cheaper than the real B&G in the grocery store
B001BKVWYG|5.0|How did I miss the album in High School?  Timeless.  Echos of Bob Dylan with the brass of a Bobby Hart and Tommy Boyce ballad.  I liked nearly every cut.  Some of the topics could be about society now, not just the problems of the 70's.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I can sit and play for hours. it's a fast paced game you just have to get further every time you play. it's really fun
0765325950|1.0|I have waited this long to read this book on my Kindle unfortunately I will have to wait even longer.  So sad, but as all the other books in the series are on my Kindle, I am not going to buy the hardback just to read it sooner.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|I downloaded thinking it was something else, afterwards when I tried to play it I saw it was not what I thought it was, I am not saying this game is no good, so I can't give a good rate
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a very useful, flexible, and user-friendly app.  It provides so many translations literally at your finger tips. Highly recommended.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter loves the other Tinkerbell movies and this one does not disappoint.<br /><br />A great new addition to the Tinkerbell story line.  A must have!
B009IF8CH6|4.0|I haven't seen everything yet... obviously..., but what I have seen is great!<br />I can't wait for the entire season to be completed!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I loved the app it is fun and very enjoyable.<br /> it keeps your kids very occupied I absolutely love this app.
0375869026|5.0|My 9 year old son read this and could not put it down. He loved it. Really enjoyed the way the book is told by various perspectives.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great movie, story line and strong heroine.  My daughter loves this movie.<br /><br />Could possibly be scary to younger children because of mild violence and peril scenes.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Rarely do I find any good movies to rent and this was one I saw in the theatre and then I rented it because I knew it would be good to watch again. Definitely worth buying even
B001FB4W0W|4.0|Highly entertaining. Good drama, good acting. Not annoying and boring (yet) like many other vampire and chick fiction shows. I feel like the whole premise is semi-original.
B004YXE438|5.0|I don't care for most jigsaw puzzles, but I love this! Lots of fun with several ways to play with different combinations of difficulty.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|If you love the book - you will love the film.<br /><br />I was so excited to learn who voiced the characters.  Classic.<br /><br />We watch these on family movie night and the kids still beg to read the book.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I think it is a great action film that slightly confuses you or intrigues you I should say, but the ending is not right and it seems that they are trying to hard to make it confusing that the plot doesn't actually exist! It's worth renting I would say, but don't get too excited
B005JR3Y5W|3.0|This show is great for exactly the reason I purchased it- something to kind of laugh at while I have an hour or two before bed. It's overdone, and it's obvious that the writers went out of their way to try to get a &#34;nerdy&#34; character. It is what it is....a bland drama- how I met your mother, only, not.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I'm normally not one for those musical movies but this one was pretty darn hilarious and the music was great to hear. Anna Kendrick was phenomenal, and I could listen to her sing all day long.  One of the other people to keep an eye out for is Rebel Wilson aka \\"Fat Amy\\" who was surprisingly very funny.  If you like comedy in any form or musical types this is a definite buy for the collection.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|It was a great book very violent though. Less death you know.My kid loved it. I would recommend it for12 to 15 year olds.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Best game ever if any of you guys like Mario world this<br />Is the best game you can ever get I love it its my favorite !!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is fun and some levels are a bit challenging. I downloaded it for my kids but I enjoy playing too.
B000I186FW|4.0|Rented this last night and watched it with the family. There is some violence and blood, but only brief amount of nudity, no sex either but there are many references to sexuality and orientation. The movie itself is great, with a wonderful cast. Its a little slow and might be hard for some inattentive viewers to follow along with it.
B00000IQB7|5.0|One of my favorite movies from the 80&#34;s. It has it all, very entertaining. Fast cars, aliens, time warps, T Rex, it is a must see for all 80's fans.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Amazing service. Everything went smooth gor the batman trilogy on dvd an loved it. Keep up the good. So since that went well I decided to buy other goods. So I bought cell fhone case for my s3 as well as a sd card as well.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is a very good book, but I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't a young adult. Really, it's a book that I wish I would have read in high school. I felt like a jaded old person at times because things that were supposed to be heartwarming and \\"deep\\" really got on my nerves.<br />That said, if you're a young adult or a parent to a young adult, I couldn't recommend this book enough! This book manages to speak honestly about tough issues without the patronizing tone that most YA books have about such things. The book also has some very good messages about friendship, acceptance, self-love and family. It can be quite tragic at times, but the overall themes are pretty positive.<br />Don't buy Twilight or any of the other YA Fantasy-Romance novels de jour. Buy this for your teen daughter and give her real things to think about.
B00ACBN9CI|1.0|The controls don't work, the graphics are not good, and absolutely zero instruction other than to spend money to unlock any planes. Not well liked.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not a big fan of anything sci-fi or futuristic, but this novel just blew me away!  Written with a great deal of passion, the storyline becomes very believable.  We are certainly not too far removed from this world created by Hugh Howey.  His style of writing was very absorbing and you felt part of the story.  I plan on reading the 6th and 7th installment as well, although I have heard there are different characters involved.  I enjoyed Wood immensely!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a very funny and relatable book to read. I was very very impressed. Way better than the others.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This collection flies by while reading such a creative set of connected stories.  I admit that sci-fi is not my favorite genre, but I greatly enjoyed this.  I am eager for more tales of the silos.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|If you noticed the music during the film, enjoy Howard Shore's scores, or just loved the Dwarfs' songs, this album will satisfy.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I do like a lot of the song on this CD it not my favorite one but being a huge Twilight fan I would still recommend to get it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I am a book lover and very hard to please so I was a bit skeptical about reading this one book but after the first chapter my eyes stayed glued to it. It's truly an amazing piece.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|one of my all-time holiday favorites, this movie is a must-have.<br />Now i will be able to watch this movie all december long
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is the best from the Kendrick brothers to date. Heartfelt, riveting, and glorifying<br />God at the same time. Awesome!
B001FB4W0W|4.0|bought it as christmas present. Wife loved it. I am not into these types of shows, but my wife is and wanted this very badly!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Free download and install it on the rope experiments and the rope to get to hear from the government guy in
0671449028|5.0|Nigthly bedtime stories are must in our house. this is a nice addition to our growing children's book colllection.<br />The illustrations are beautiful and the writing makes me chuckle.<br />I like Sandra Boyntons books!
0765325950|1.0|Really Tor?<br /><br />I'd like to think the best of any situation, but the only reason for holding the release of the ebook format is greed. Thank you for showing us that money is more important to you than customer relationships.  Are you really going to gain more than you lose?
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I enjoyed reading the original story after watching several movies based on A Christmas Carol.  it's interesting to see what was left in or was changed.  I probably will read it again next Christmas!
B000SGGUWS|4.0|This was a great book! Could get a little confusing at times and has foul language and a lil bit inappropriate scenes!  But overall fanstastic!
B002NXSRX4|4.0|Movie is what you would expect...lots of CGR.  Overall, a good movie. Not the most sophisticated acting, but decent performances.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|It was well written. I really understood the characters, they had very distinct traits. John Green is fantastic! I'm definitely going to read more of his books.
0812550706|3.0|This book seems to be getting reviews literally daily no doubt because of the upcoming movie.  So I have no illusions that mine will even get noticed among the other 3000+ that have been written.  It seems that the review are either by those that really like the book or those that cannot stand it. With a few in between.  I have to say that I fall somewhere in between but that I lean toward those that were disappointed with the story.  First let me say that I thought that it was a good idea with an ending that rated with the best of the Twilight Zone episodes and it left me looking forward to reading the next book in the series because of the interesting concepts that it raised toward the end. The problem is the book did not get that good until the last quarter of the story.  As all the other negative reviews have stated that first three quarters of the book is very relative with all the chapters seeming to be endless rounds of training with not much happening.  This could have been improved on (see Starship Trooper) but this is not  my biggest objection. I can appreciate why Card would put all of this in.  My biggest objection is that the main characters were way to young to make their behavior and that of the adults around them at all believable.  I know that one has to suspend a little belief especially in Sci Fi, but this seems to wander into the realm of adolescent fantasy.  Perhaps I waited until I was to old to really appreciate this book but I just cannot see children (not even teenagers) talking in this way. Now notice I did not say behaving but talking because I think that the book raises some very important points about violence and children and I could not help but be reminded of modern day child soldiers especially in the parts where Ender is placed in morally ambiguous situations.  I guess in the end I was expecting a book that had won both a Hugo and a Nebula have a little better dialogue.  So bottom line: Do I recommend the Book? Yes. Not so much for itself but for some of the interesting concepts it raises and for what it promises in its sequel.But don't expect to be wowed by the story.itself but for some of the interesting concepts it raises and for what it promises in its sequel.But don't expect to be wowed by the story.
B004X80QNG|1.0|I use a lot of GTD apps like Astrid, Todoidt, RTM, Tooledo, Todo.ly, Google Task, and Any.do.  I just like trying them out. Apart from CalenGoo, I have never paid as much for an app as this one.  The reviews in 2011 were clear, as was the description, that the calendar does not sync on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />However, later 2012 reviews said it did, and that all the negative reviews were wrong.  I just wanted something that would sync task.  I installed this app. On clicking open there is a flash of a message too brief to read all of it, but one can read \\"forced to close,\\" in the brief second it appears.<br /><br />So I uninstalled, reinstalled, rebooted and got the same result. I then uninstalled, rebooted, closed all running task and reinstalled, thinking maybe Avast or some other process was preventing correct installation. No good. 7 bucks and it won't even load on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />This is the content of about 15 crash logs in its directory, all the same:<br /><br /> java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: the name must not be empty: null<br /> at android.accounts.Account.(Account.java:48)<br /> at net.webis.pocketinformant.model.google_contact.AccountTypeManagerImpl.loadAccountsInBackground(AccountTypeManager.java:442)<br /> at net.webis.pocketinformant.model.google_contact.AccountTypeManagerImpl$3.handleMessage(AccountTypeManager.java:247)<br /> at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99)<br /> at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:130)<br /> at android.os.HandlerThread.run(HandlerThread.java:60)
B0018AM1YY|5.0|Being a child of the sixties and seventies I love this. Takes me back a few years. Most of the songs on this album are gems.I am not disappointed in the least.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This story is riveting and moving. It teaches a value while maintaining originality and truth. I couldn't imagine a greater read. I didn't put this book down till I read it all the way through. A true classic and a piece that will open your eyes and move you in so many ways.
0451232852|5.0|Wonderful insight into why WW1 happened.  In addition, I visited Verdun and this gave further insight to this horrible war and the multitude of deaths.  And added the understanding of why we waited so long to enter the war.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Cornwell really brings this period of history alive.  Look forward to reading all of his books in the very near future !
B007M45PMU|5.0|Bought this album on a whim after hearing &#34;ho, hey!&#34; repeatedly on the radio.  So glad because the album is wonderful!!
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|So far it is working out great.  Being able to divide my different interests into there own notebook has been a big help.  I don't have to hunt through a bunch of note to find details.  Keeping separate books  cuts time down
B000AM2L1O|4.0|I gave the doll to my sister who is a mentally handicapped resident at an Assisted Living Facility. She named her doll Marie. I love the doll but my sister keeps forgetting where she leaves Marie. However, I am very pleased with my purchase.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Progressively more entertaining as the initial sketchy plot gains depth. Actually very funny in surprising ways, as well as entertaining. Singing and dancing lovely--yeah yeah, it's not real life, and I thank the writers for the escape and fun.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I loved it, I've read all his books and it gets better each time he writes a new novel..Harry Bosch is back baby!!!
B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|I first purchased this album back in the really early 70\\"s.  It was my first introduction to Pink Floyd.  Somewhere during the next 10-12 moves and the next 20 years I lost the album.  Bought it again late last year (2012). I have a much nicer stereo system now than I did in the olden days.  The upgrade in equipment has brought Meddle to LIFE!!  I hear little notes here and there now that I did not hear before.  How exciting to get back that which had been lost for so long only to find out that it is better now than it ever was way back when.
B0002XMKYE|4.0|Great movie all around.  Patton was a hard driving son of a b1tch .. but he was right.  His belief was to quickly end the battle by overwhelming his enemy.  This is portrayed in the movie as he drives his men hard.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I definitely enjoyed this game. I am a fan of Tycoon games and this one has an interesting twist. It is worth the $2.50, I have played games more expensive than this and not enjoyed them as much. An excellent game.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I thought this book was really good, but it took a long time for it to really capture my attention. I know it has good reviews, so I didn't want to give up. I'm glad I didn't. Also, there seemed to be a lot of characters to try to keep straight - some memorable to me, some not. I'll be starting book 2 soon.
0765325950|5.0|Well it has been about 20 years coming.  There has been no point in my life where I have been an avid reader that TWOT wasn't an ongoing series and people were speculating about the ending.  As for AMOL...this is pretty much a continuation of what Sanderson did with the last two books.  Writing is the same, story is still great.  Sad to see it end.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a great application. It seems that more radio stations are streaming. I really like that I can get NOA weather radio for my area.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|It's almost embarrassing how much I like Community.  Ever since I discovered it a year and a half ago, I've had to ask all my &#34;TV-head&#34; friends if they've watched it.  The ones that have like it more than I do.  The rest...have never heard of it.<br /><br />I got these as a gift for my wife so I could feign protest about having to give up my TV viewing choice to allow her turn to choose these for us both watch.  It's win/win.  She has become a bigger fan of Community than me, and I get to watch way more football than I should.<br /><br />The set is loaded with extras, and you can tell the creator put everything he had into the show (too bad he has been fired, watching his interviews on this set make you really sad for the guy).<br /><br />This show is fast.  Very  fast.  You'll have to hold on to your remote to rewind some of the dialogue because the seven major characters complete for lines.  It sounds tedious, but you'll be hooked in no time.  Plus, you'll have to go back and hear the dialogue you were laughing over.  As far as first seasons goes, this sets the table (see what I did there) perfectly.  Get this set.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|Purchased two of these watches for my grandson.  He is a lego expert and this was a challange to put togeather plus have a watch after you succeded the process of assembly.
B00000JMOF|5.0|Grave-robbing scientist Victor Frankenstein (Colin Clive) is<br />attempting to create a son out of parts of dead bodies. A brain<br />his crazy assistant (Dwight Frye) has stolen waits to live again<br />in a body they will sew together. Once the brain is in place, a<br />platform will raise the body up through the roof of their<br />laboratory where lightning from a brewing storm will strike it<br />and give it life.<br />For sure, this isn't a son Victor wants sitting on<br />his lap calling him Dad.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is a great app. I got space birds first and really liked the way that gravity impacted flight. This adds Star Wars aspects to it.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|very funny, clever and thoroughly enjoyable movie, the animation was excellent and the dialogue hilarious, could see this every 2months and would never get bored
B0011AQLZQ|2.0|For a film with this running time, I would have expected a faithful rendition of the book.  Instead, the director seems to have placed wierd emphases on the smallest things and dropped others that made more sense.  Rowling is a great storyteller with a fine sense of pace and a great way of letting us see through Harry's eyes as he discovers the rich world of his birthright that he's just being exposed to.  The film gives very little sense. of that.  If they'd been more faithful to Rowling's pacing, things would have worked out a lot better.  The wild ride through Gringotts would have been great fun.  Dumbledore did not work at all for me and the ending was just altered for no good reason.  Overall I'm very disappointed.
B00933JL0A|5.0|the game is fun and challenging. it is not too difficult and plays well. I have had hours of fun and have not gotten tired of it. I highly recomend it.
B0084AYLK8|2.0|Even though it is free, and I appreciate that, there was about a chapter missing.  I would suggest this either be fixed, or the book removed from sale.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Two brilliant psychotic characters battle wits in their love/hate relationship.  Well-written; lots of twists and turns in an improbable plot.  Hard to put down.  Interesting style with diary entries, back-flashes and real time sections interwoven.  I recommend it.
B003QSOE0U|3.0|Tooooooooooo Long, could have cut 45min to 1 hour off this movie would have made it better should have hired a better editor.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Bob Seger is still the man.  There is no heartland rocker who has the voice like he does.  He is the ultimate roots rocker.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This thing is great. Tough and easy to hold. The fold back cover, where it slides into the groove on the back to stand up, isn't perfect and can fall out at the slightest touch. But if I just leave it sitting there, it is fine and doesn't fall. I even use it like that next to me on the bed and it is fine. I really like the texture and color (I got grey).
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Wow! This movie is awesome. The best I seen in a while. Lawless, a must see. Make me want to read the book.
B00A757EFW|4.0|The only problem I found was getting use to the toggle tool to move where I wanted it to go, otherwise I loved this game.
B00511PTWM|1.0|looks good, and was good until it didnt work and broke with only my cell phone charger in it.. product is a joke i recommend NOT buying this.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I usually love the Pendergast novels, however, this read like a poorly written Lifetime movie. The plot would have survived had I not had to plod through the sub plot &#34;muck.&#34; It seems, to me, Preston & Child, are content to take the James Patterson route and sacrifice substance for sales. A shame.
B003MX95H6|5.0|EXCELLENT MOVIE<br /><br />MY HUSBAND AND I ARE 70 - AND BOTH THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT...<br /><br />VERY WELL DONE<br /><br />REALISTIC SCENARIO
B000KKPN5C|5.0|And that's what most people complain about. You can't do this. You can't do that.<br /><br />Realizing that this is basically the pop-up flash on steroids and nothing more makes life a lot easier. What advantage does it have? You can bounce the flash (very important), it has a little bit more power AND... it is extremely small. That means it doesn't take up a lot of space, and it also doesn't intimidate people as much as a large flash.<br />Don't dismiss is little flash too quickly, it has its place and it's actually used more than my three SB-600's together.
B002KREVCO|5.0|I purchased this for a friend. He is an AC/DC big fan, and he liked it a lot. So if you're a fan too, my guess is that it's worth getting it!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Holds up well.  Easy to use and I'll never review another product cause being required to use a certain number of words is a pain in the neck
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Chess Free is a basic chess game that satisfies my needs. It has a sliding bar that you use to increase/decrease the skill of the computer. I found the computer made stupid moves if the scale was up only a third of the way. However, as I increased the level of difficulty, I found the computer to be very difficult for me to beat. It has an undo button that you is readily accessible on the main screen. One area for improvement is screen position. For some reason the screen is upside down relative to other applications.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I was into it before it told me I had to pay. I don't think its worth the price. please make the whole game free or lower the price to. 99
B005LAII1C|4.0|Purchased this DVD as a stocking stuffer for my husband. We both loved the movie and were interested to see what the unrated version would have. I think we noticed a couple of scenes that were different but the most noticeable thing was that there were scenes missing. We will be watching the regular version from now on.
0765325950|5.0|No ebook? I can't believe that's people's biggest concern. This is an epic undertaking, and we should all feel blessed that it is actually ending! For a while there, I was concerned that we wouldn't get the last few books because of Robert Jordan's passing. To me, he seems like a great man, and he took time in his last years to lay the groundwork for someone to come in and complete the series because he cared that much about his fans and the material. And Brandon Sanderson. Wow. What an incredible author. Not only did he pick up where Robert Jordan left off seemlessly, but he breathed new life into a series that people were complaining was losing its luster. The last couple of books have been amazing, and I really can't wait to see how the series ends! Stop giving bad reviews because you're spoiled into not having to \\"lug around a bible\\". Give back to the people that made this possible and be thankful it's even happening!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Wonderful movie on 3D with those special effects. A magical story.,,,,,,, Every person most heave it........ Great for a new generation of people.......
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Got this for my mom and her favorite feature is how the Kindle will come on simply by opening the cover.  The on button can be very difficult to find for anyone, especially a retiree who needs glasses!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lots of fun, buy it still makes you think. It is actually relaxing; challenging bit not frustrating. It is definitely worth having on your device.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was SO captivating, it was so hard for me to put it down to tend to my 3 year old or go to work. There were a few parts that were a little confusing, parts where I thought the emotions/thoughts of the main characters could've been expressed a little more clearly but other than that, I would definitely recommend this book to any romantic :)
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great graphics, smooth game play and just an overrall sweet game so far.  i'll give a better review when i get father along.
B0093URN4E|5.0|Converge has done it again!  This band is just all around amazing!  If you like fast punk/metal, this album, or any other of their albums are a must have.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I have read all of the Harry Poter series and loved them.  This book I could hardly force myself to finish.  It seemed to support bullying at school.  Lots of vulgar language in 13 year old.  The parents had no idea what their children were doing and the children showed no respect for their parents or their teachers.  Sex among the 13 year olds was seemingly OK as was drugs and alcohol.<br /><br />I am not a prude BUt to me this was way out of my area on enjoyment.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|the awful lanugage,  the sex  just wasnt funny  Dry humping a pole at a grocery store of all places.  The  drug smoking!!!!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It's okay.  Wouldn't recommend it to anyone if they would ask me.  I thinks there are other bingo games that are better.  Also, there doesn't seem to be any control over the &#34;chat&#34; and had one guy that was totally out of line on there!
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Loved the entertaining characters. It wasn't bogged down by heavy plot or ideas. Just simple mystic characters with simple needs for love and attention.
B001J9AQA0|5.0|I love the piano pop/rock of The Script!  I'm normally more of a rock/alternative kinda girl, but this is a great album.  Definitely 5 stars
B006TJXZ30|1.0|This is a pointless app.  The E-mail app that comes with the Kindle Fire HD is incredible and picks up all ISP mail carriers nicely, and in spite of some clamped down networks.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is really addicting and easy to play the first day I got it I got to level 10 then came to write this but parents be careful you can buy coins with real money but other then that it is really fun.
B00AEJM6H2|1.0|This game did not give enough instruction. I am an adult with at least normal to above intelligence and can't figure how to play this game.
B009JBZH54|5.0|it really is, i promise. the special features alone are worth the money!! plus you get all three films in hd, what isn't there to love about this?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing! Sky and Holder are such beautiful characters. The way they interact and the way their pasts and presents come together is a page turner. I definitely recommend this book!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This app is very user friendly. I can now send print jobs to my printer from anywhere with ease.  I am using it on my Samsung 3 phone and my Kindle Fire tablet.
B0000C2IQD|4.0|I bought this movie for my daughter and her boyfriend as it is their favorite! They were very surprised when they unwrapped it and couldn't wait to watch it!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Super quick read, or maybe I just couldn't put it down.  Found it especially fun as a San Franciscan.  Highly recommended!
1452110581|5.0|This book is amazing. It's so funny and if you like, know or understand cats... this book is a necessity.
B0045KCD10|3.0|It's a cute movie. The leads are filmed in some sort of throwback glow that make it nostalgic and cheesy at the same time. Just like Christmas!
B006TVQTHW|5.0|If I could describe this enclosure with just one word it would be AMAZING!<br /><br />When I bought this case I did not read too much about it, I'm an Antec 300 owner, so I just saw the pictures, saw the cut outs for cable management, and I was sold. But then I realized I should read a little about it (the case was on the way), and I found some reviews that commented that there was no cable management option for the 8-pin connector on the top, and that there was not enough room between the cpu cut out and the MB to pass it through there; found some that said that the ssd mounts did not align properly to mount them, and several said the audio cable was too short, and that it wouldn´t reach lower left connectors if routed through the cable management options.<br /><br />Well I recieved my case,and inmediately opened it, and started the inspection (was looking if I needed to do some mods). I was so pleasently surprised that the audio cable is very long, I even had to ziptie it to hide it, so no trouble with that. Then I tried mounting the ssd in both positions and all 4 screw holes matched perfectly (still havent decided which one I'll use, but a word of CAUTION if you mount in the back make sure to do it before you install your MB or just use two of the four mounting screws). Lastly my nightmare about how to route the 8 pin power cable came to an end. Thanks to a in depth inspection, I found out that the mother board tray is separated from the back of the case, and there's a 3/4 inch gap for cable routing, so you can easily route your 8 pin through there, your front panel cables, your fans, and even the big usb3 connector.<br /><br />I can't believe I saw \\"professional\\" reviews that didn't see the full cable management potential, and that antec is not making it known. This is a great case, I don't really have a single issue with it.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This movie is funnier than the American version  It arrived quickly to my home and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
B008O037RG|5.0|Shipped quickly, arrived packaged nicely, item was just like it was described and it worked perfectly. . . . .
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Very disterbing to read at first. It gives you hope that there are other boys and girls still out there looking for hope. She has so much courage God bless her.
B0051O8Z66|5.0|I just learned about this group about a week ago and I have been hooked to YouTube watching a ton of their performances and interviews since then. This album is amazing, even more so when you watch the documentary that was filmed while they were writing the songs on the first disc. I definitely would not have liked it as much if I didn't know the background that went into making it. Great songwriting and singing all around. The songs jump all over the board in terms of their sound, but my favorites are The Flood, SOS, Eight Letters, and Wait. I wish they were popular enough to perform in the U.S. because I have never wanted to see a concert more badly in my life. Heck, I wish they were just popular enough that I could walk into a store and buy one of their albums or DVDs instead of having to scour the internet. I was surprised that it's even hard to find their music on iTunes.
B006O3MU96|4.0|My Grandsons love playing this game. The will go to it automatically if I hand them my device. I sure your kids will love it too.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|My friend has asked for this for Christmas for many years, it was such a good deal I was skeptical at first, but I decided to take the risk.  I was not disappointed and neither was she. It's the same as the $200+ ones they sell at Best Buy.
B001E9641K|5.0|I've always loved games, but have never played this type of game. I decided it may be the only way to get my 9 year-old nephew interested in his Norwegian heritage so decided to give it a try. He got it for Christmas and we've been playing strong ever since. He plays it all the time with his 84 year old grandma or myself or both. I came home from work the other day and he had written a note including how badly he had beaten grandma and how he did it. It's been wonderful having a game suited for 2 or 3 people. I had lost all hope for him to enjoy any game that didn't involve a nunchuck. My friend from Bulgaria who doesn't enjoy games became so addicted to this game that we played until 2am one night. It's been a long time since we've laughed this much. My nephew loves blocking routes and he's probably the only kid in his class who knows how to get from Narvik to Murmansk.
B005CRQ3IE|5.0|As I hoped, this read was cover-to-cover creativity from the fertile mind of JK Rowling-- delightful, and certainly confirms some of my suspicions regarding things hard to explain in the Muggle world...like why piles of dust appear overnight in corners dusted the day before! ( see section on 'Ashwinders').<br />I would have loved more graffiti in the margins, and additional doodles throughout.<br />Might be hard for some younger readers to comprehend without discussion.<br />Overall I appreciated every page for the chance to hear a little bit more of the wizarding world! The feel-good benefit of providing funds for those in need is just icing on the cake. Enjoy!
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely loved ever minute of this book! It's amazing how a story can pull you in. Looking forward to the next one!
0345803485|5.0|Once you start reading about the 80th page your hooked, line and sinker!! And it does have a story to it! A must read!
B0084BMUFA|4.0|I liked this book because the writer made  a heart-warming story. Ebenezer Scrooge sure learned an important lesson. Alex Bailey
B000I04044|5.0|I love the older movies and I love that Amazon has these kinda of movies still!!!! It's a funny wholesome show that my kids can watch with me which is getting very rare these day.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I like this book because it delves into the otherside of Grey.  It gives more of the background on why he is the way he is.<br />It's also shows a stronger side to Anastasia.
0345803507|5.0|I loved this whole book series, it did have a story to it for those who wonder! A must read!!
B00A8V3VVG|4.0|The soundtrack to Quentin Tarantino's most recent film [[ASIN:B00A8V3VVG Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]] (starring Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson, etc.) complements the film superbly.  Listening to a soundtrack out of context gives a different spin as opposed if you are critiquing the soundtrack within the confines of the film itself. While this compilation works well either way (I listened before seeing the film), it connects BEST to the listener within the film or having seen the film.  Within the soundtrack, not only is music included, but so are memorable spoken word dialogues from the script.<br /><br />Amongst spoken dialogue included are \\"Winged\\", an :08 snippet performed by James Russo (plays Dicky Speck), which appears within the first few moments of the film and initiates the soundtrack. \\"Django\\", composed by famed Argentine composer Luis Bacalov, reappears from the composer's original [[ASIN:B006UK2JTE Django]] soundtrack. The perfect music for a western, \\"Django\\" serves as a perfect theme within Quentin Tarantino's context as well.  \\"The Braying Mule\\" (\\"Il Mulo Regliante\\"), a product of Italian film composer Ennio Morricone, continues to lift the soundscape with brilliant, classic, and eclectic sounds that complement the film and are equally pleasant to listen to outside of the film. Featuring guitar, flute, percussion, and sitar, \\"The Braying Mule\\" is one of many Ennio Morricone features from Django Unchained.<br /><br />\\"In The Case of Django, After You...\\" is a spoken dialogue between Christoph Waltz (Dr. Schultz) and Jamie Foxx (Django) lasting every bit of :38.  Luis Bacalov is the featured famed film composer once more on \\"Lo Chiamavano King (My Name Is King)\\", originating from Lo Chiamavano King .  Roots-soul cut \\"Freedom\\" is a standout, performed by a raspy Elayna Boynton and a gritty Anthony Hamilton. \\"I'm looking for freedom / looking for freedom / and to find it / cost me everything I have...\\" fits perfect within the concept of slavery and doing anything to attain freedom.  Both vocalists seem a sound fit for this number in particular.<br /><br />\\"Five-Thousand Dollar [...] and Gummy Mouth [...]\\" is a spoken portion of the film in which Dr. Schultz and Django go to `Big Daddy's' plantation, etc.  \\"La Corsa (2nd Version)\\" (Luis Bacalov) continues a series of exceptional film music classics (Django), followed by :34 spoken word dialogue \\"Sneaky Schultz and the Demise of Sharp\\".  Jim Croce's 1973 classic \\"I Got A Name\\" (no. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100), fits perfectly on both the soundtrack and within the scope of the film, given its themes/lyrics of having a `dream' and of course definitive title lyric \\"I got a Name\\".<br /><br />Riziero Ortolani contrasts the prominence of Luis Bacalov and Ennio Morricone with his past \\"I Giorni Dell'Ira\\" laying well with its jazz sensibilities, most notably blaring brass and gargantuan sounds.  Rick Ross infuses a modern edge on the excellent \\"100 Black Coffins\\" in which he raps: \\"I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men / a hundred black graves so I can lay they [...] in...\\" Ross even manages to throw in his distinguishing vocal cues (\\"Oh lord!\\").  No film soundtrack lifting classic film music seems right without the exceptional Jerry Goldsmith, whose \\"Nicaragua\\" makes a re-appearance from 1983's Academy Award Nominated soundtrack [[ASIN:B00191LR6K Under Fire: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]].  Nothing short of excellence from Goldsmith, who has provided a musical lift to so many notable films.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson (who plays Stephen) delivers one of the film's more memorable moments on \\"Hildi's Hot Box\\", a spoken word segment in which Stephen informs plantation owner Leonardo Di Caprio (Calvin Candie) that Django's wife Brumhilda (Kerry Washington) is in the punishing `hot box'. Ennio Morricone returns with \\"Sister Sara's Theme\\", a slow, mysterious piece from his past film work.  Ennio collaborates with Italian singer Elisa on the Italian original cut \\"Ancora Qui\\", a sure-fire frontrunner for an Oscar original song nod.<br /><br />\\"Unchained (The Payback / Untouchable)\\" is a brilliant mashup of James Brown's 1973 classic (\\"The Payback\\" from the album of the same title) and 2Pac's \\"Untouchable\\" (2006's [[ASIN:B000JJRIO8 Pac's Life]]). John Legend keeps up the lofty momentum with his own gritty soul cut, \\"Who Did That To You\\", which only confirms how much Legend's constituency is ready for a new studio album from the soul star.  Characterized by a thudding beat, soulful vocals, and a roots-driven sound, \\"Too Old To Die Young\\" is another exceptional cut courtesy of Brother Dege (AKA Dege Legg). This cut appears near the conclusion of the film when Django (Foxx) amps up his `bounty hunting' spree.<br /><br />Samuel Jackson appears in two more spoken word portions (\\"Stephen The Poker Player\\" and the incredibly memorable \\"Six Shots Two Guns\\"). Similarly, Ennio Morricone ushers in two final cuts including \\"Un Monumento\\" and concluding cut \\"Trinity: Titolli\\".<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00A8V3VVG Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]] is a well pieced together soundtrack.  The mix of classics and originals bode well, with little complaints. Context aids in understanding the spoken word tracks obviously, but even for the person who has not seen the film, it is still an enjoyable addition to any soundtrack collection.lm work.

B001U3Y5XE|5.0|It's a great game if you like building with Legos. It does take a little while to get the picture built, so everyone has to sit patiently and wait to start guessing. But we still really enjoy the game.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Really love this app. It is so addicting. My daughter loves to play this as welll I would recommend this
B009UX2YAC|5.0|amazing this game is like cool. if you get this game you will love it. subway surfer is awesomely cool!!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I bought this when my greatgrandson saw it and wanted it. He is 8 years old and does very good at this game.  When I first got it he played with it for hours. I can't think of a better reason to buy this game then pleasing my great grandson and daughter she play it too when he lets her.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|this book seemed to be more about Mitch Rapp than Jack Ryan, though I liked the continueation of the Jack jr romance.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love this app pulls my stuff right up. Easy to search for things. Like how everything is set up. :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought that this book was going to be poorly written and have no depth. The only reason that I started  to read  it was because I have friends that wouldn't stop talking about this series and I wanted to be able to put in my opinion. I AM SO GLAD THAT I READ THIS BOOK!!!! This book was very well written. The descriptions were great and the story flowed and connected throughout the whole book! I actually started to find myself becoming attached to the characters and not wanting to out the my kindle down. I cannot say enough great things about this  book and cannot wait to read the rest in the series. I WOULD RECOMMEND  THIS BOOK TO ANYONE THAT ENJOYS GETTING SUCKED INTO A GREAT READ!!!!
B008Y1YK9Y|2.0|Wow - this was a real disappointment. All gee-whiz special effects, crude violence and rapid-fire but curiously lifeless dialog, lots of uninvolving would-be crisp banter. This film had no emotional core, no compelling plot and nothing really mind-blowing or even mildly thought-provoking, at least nothing to compare to the freshness of the first two MIB flicks. I suspect many scenes looked awesome in 3D -- I saw it on a regular old DVD and thought it was pretty lame. (Axton)
B000UE29SW|5.0|I lost a lot of family in 2 years.  I also found a girl whom lost her twins to seperate car accidents.  This book has opened the door to life for us. What happens to you when you die, where  your loved ones go, the importance of loving one another, that your words carry more power than you would ever imagine. It reveals the veil we get at birth. The warring angels she saw that fight for our well being. Our Guardians, the works.  Death is not such a mystery now. And it shows that those we love that have passed are very defiantely still with us.  I have given this book away more than once.  It has helped us immensely.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I bought this at a great price and then I got a free version to watch online for a certain amount of time. This was a great surprise, I did not use it, but I regret not using it. Such a great movie and so great for kids and adults.
B0017SWPXY|1.0|I really expected it to be an uplifting sequel to &#34;Racing in The Rain&#34; but it was sadly disappointing in that respect! Barely started reading it, and gave up in frustration.  Truly a tragic themed work.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|You will like this movie if you liked the first expendables movie! This is even better! This franchise serves as a tribute to the 80's - 90's action films. It is a classic and if you like the style of films as previously mentioned, you'll love this, I guarantee it! Even though these guys are old, they still rock it!
B00A757EFW|1.0|I chose this rating because the joystick is so difficult to get the Pac-man to move in the right direction.  It is not easily maneuverable.  I loved this game as a teenager and I am sorry that I downloaded it to my Kindle now.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I really liked this book. It was a little hard for me to keep all the different types of downworlders and things straight but I think I am getting it. Never would have guessed that Jace would have ended up being Clarys brother...interested in reading the next books to learn more.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to all of my friends that enjoy reading. Especially since a movie is coming out they will like having an inside scoop to the plot.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is the first of the Jack Reacher mystery thrillers.  It is well written and keeps you guessing up to the end.  Great read.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|i like this game alot it is like farmville for kids and im 18 i just wish you didnt have to pay for the jewles
1451673442|5.0|Exactly what I expected!!! Nothing less than what I wanted, ordered and received! It came without problem or incident and I hope others can enjoy it!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I prefer rpgs, but at the same time I cant stop playing thiz game. I have to beat it. I just hope there is an end. Dont like games that go on forever.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Twists and turns with great acting. Don't mess with the babe. Great characters, after effects are scary because everybody is naughty.
B008476HBM|5.0|My favorite book ever! It is wonderfully written and the plot is exciting and hard to put down once started.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|great deal easy to figure out old fashioned alarm as an option also gives weather and music and sounds with a timer to fall asleep
B006VFLIYK|4.0|David Baldacci keeps you wondering until the end, a good read at any time.  Six more words are required but I have nothing to say.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|I am a spy fan, and though this movie is good and has a brilliant thread running through it it moves very slow so you have to have patience to survive.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy fun. Very relaxing game to play and easy enough to play and watch football games at the same time!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Very interesting reading, if I were to read some of the passages out loud, you might believe that I was reading from a current newspaper.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was so intriging that I enhaled it and had to have the Shadow of the Nite at 10:00PM so I could go on.  So great to beable to buy on line so quick and easy.  It was like turning a page to the next chapter.  Can't wait for the last book. but then what will I read?
B0083DJWGO|5.0|Certainly one of the best books I have ever read.  This is the only Taleb book I have read.  I've recommended to several others and all rate highly.
B00006D295|5.0|Just as expected, glad to have it at a great price, have already watched and can't wait to watch again.
B00A12VW86|3.0|I think Green Day would have better served their public with i album of great songs instead of three with WAY too many mediocre  songs
B007N8RULO|2.0|There is not enough contrast between the cards to easily pick out the different numbers. They tend to blend in to each other. For example, a 6 of hearts with only one heart on the card is not as easy to pick out quickly as a 6 of hearts with six hearts on the card.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|this is a pretty decent movie - it goes to another level with time travel this time, but overall I thought it was cool, and continued the same theme/feel as the first two. My favorite moment is in the beginning, the funeral speech held by agent K.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely, so much so that I hated to put it down. When I did have to leave the book, I couldn't get it out of my mind. I finished it in two days and was left wanting more. This is not to mean that the story was lacking in anything--I simply did not want it to end.  It contains lots of technical jargon, yet it was put into simple enough terms so that I could easily follow the gist of what was going on. I would think this story would appeal not only to sci-fi loving engineers but to anyone who enjoys contemporary, realistic science fiction which, unfortunately, can be difficult to find during this period of fantasy mania.<br />Very highly recommended!
0307460444|5.0|Normally don't buy dessert cook books, but this is a necessary one if you want to make perfect cupcakes in today's styles.  Amazon has best price as usual!!!
B0063GORYU|2.0|I've had cards move when my cursor passed over the top of them without the intent to move them, then they are difficult to return to the proper place. Very little control of the cards.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|Sweet is all I can say... Patton has to be one of my all time best. Got to love G.C. Scott
B002W1UEW4|3.0|Lots of explosions, boring story line.  Some of the technology they came up with was pretty cool, though!  I was hoping for a cooler back-story of Cobra.
B000000WF9|4.0|I'm a soundtrack junkie and I love this movie so I had to buy this.  It's not the soundtrack I'm most addicted to, but I love several of the theme songs so I had to have it.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|An excellent read. Finally truth and reality in US history. A must read for all republicans and tea baggers !!  One could only hope!
B006QF7664|3.0|Makes one think.. That we can't be the only like out there! And what do our gov. know and when did they know it?
B000KFB4PK|5.0|Great. I love it and My nephew loves it!! Thanks!! It is his 6th bday so this is his present
B00003CX8N|5.0|One of the most moving stories ever written!  Beautiful movie with 2 of my favorites!  Anne in NYC reminds me of me in NYC saying & doing things I say and do!  This is the gift I gift to my literate friends!!!!
0143118757|5.0|This book is a very basic reminder of how to engage in negotiation.  The majority of methods are common sense.  However, very rarely is common sense the strongest emotion when people are negotiating.  As a quick tip, most lawyers are trained in mediation and negotiation with this book.  If you read this book it may give an insight into what your attorney or the other attorney is doing.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read all three books in 4 days, with a full time job!! The loss of sleep I got was completely worth it, and I'm sad it's over. All I can say is BRAVO!!
B000FC10WU|5.0|Body in the Library<br /><br />I like Agatha Christie mysteries--all of them. She wrote so many mysteries fo varopis sorts.I like mysteries and to me she was the master of myster8ies.
B00007BKVC|5.0|Every moment of their caper is captivating!  You can't take your eyes off the screen!  Acting is superior & always makes me wish I was one of them so I could change the ending!  It's great, but sad when the impact of their decision hits you!!!  Beautifully shot scenery that knocks your socks off!  Supporting cast deliver amazing performances--Brad Pitt, Michael Madsen, Harvey Keitel..... I could go on and on...... It's breathtaking!  Everyone shoud own a copy of the unrated widescreen version!!!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|With all the craze over Fifty Shades of Grey, I had to check it out for myself. The book is about Anastasia Steele who meets billionaire and CEO of Grey Enterprises, Christian Grey, while interviewing him for her college magazine. Christian is immediately and inexplicably infatuated with Ana and draws her into his world of wealth and SM.<br />Just to clarify, this is not erotica. The inane language and preoccupations of this book simply do not constitute erotic fiction. Except for a brief interlude with handcuffs and a riding crop, the SM is more a discussion point than anything else. This is really a romance – that takes over 1,000 pages and three books to develop – in which an innocent young woman discovers sex with a detached and controlling billionaire.<br />In the end I cannot understand what has everyone so intrigued with this book. Nothing happens, the writing is repetitive and dull, and the characters are constantly gasping in shock at each other. Although, I will admit that I am bizarrely compelled to read the second book to see if the story finally picks up. So if you like romance novels and are not typically scandalized by momentary bondage and whippings, this is a quick, entertaining read that you can discuss with everyone else in the world.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|better than all the rest<br />my favorite out of the whole series<br />who wouldn't love this movie<br />loved it since i was 11 or 12 or longer<br />now that i'm in my 20's<br />i love it even more!
B00000DF6O|5.0|Easy great blues numbers as only BB can do them.  Any real blues lover should know this is a must have.
B000ICLRHK|5.0|Still so fun to see!  Glad I bought it so I can see Dennis Hopper behave like a madman whenever I want!
B00009TB5G|5.0|The movie was in great condition and exceeded my expectations.  Plus the special extended edition movies are awesome and totally worth the money!
B002ODEJYE|5.0|I purchased this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.  She watched it while I was dinking around on the computer, and I couldn't help but to sneak a frequent peak and enjoy the show.<br /><br />The Technical: The picture quality is fantastic, and takes advantage of the blu-ray tech.  The lighting in the video is great, and motion is clear and crisp.  Unfortunately we used the crappy flat screen speakers, but the sound was as full and clear as can be expected from the limited components. It sounds great.<br /><br />The Content:  We just watched the main feature.  It was very entertaining.  The production values must be off the charts. Colorful, well lit, tightly choreographed, and physically demanding.  Worth the purchase to see the flying acrobatics alone.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Rented this expecting some mindless fun. Well we got the mindless part right. After 20 minutes we were so bored we shut if off and went for a walk. I only wish we could get our money back. I hate to think that someone is getting paid for making something this moronic.
B001GMQALY|5.0|So gorgeous to watch!  NYC at its best!  What to say?  They are both stunning to look at & the sex is delicious!  Every time I watch it though, I wish it wouldn't end the same!  But it's very true to life, New York bad boys want it all & they want to give nothing to the girls they command.
B00A757EFW|1.0|It is not a full game........ it is a demo of a game. Deleted it already. The Demo played very well though.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As always his books are awesome and keep you on your toes the entire time! If your not a Tom Clancy fan, now is the time
B001ECPJZO|4.0|I like the idea, but it is so SMALL!  I thought it was going to be about the size of a real shoe, but it is NOT...well, i guess maybe a toddler shoe.  I teach 3rd and 4th grade special ed. and I bought this for them to practice on.  It works, but, i like i said, I just wish it was bigger!
630587493X|5.0|Robin Williams just stole my heart in this film!  I love him in Good Will Hunting & Dead Poet's Society, but thus is unforgettable.  What a beautiful tale!  You must see.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|This was a good book.  It kept my attention the whole time. I believe anyone who likes vampire book s will like this one
B0091REZMW|3.0|I poked it a lot. the graphics were very nice everything is easy to see not like most games that I have seen before.
B009HXG9UQ|4.0|This movie was so meticulously and beautifully shot. All of the little details of a Wes Anderson film that make them so great were preserved for me to revel in again and again and again...
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|M. Night Shaymalan never ceases to amaze me with his cleverness!  This movie kept me guessing and scared throughout without frivolous tricks others use.  It's a great story told very well and the end is magnificent!  Get it and watch, and hope the devil doesn't want your soul!!!!  Be vigilant!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of the funest games for a tablet! Best of all it's free! It's addicting and I would recommend it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Love it. This is my families go to for a movie.  Never get tired of Ron,Harry and Hermoine.  I recommend it.
B000002AGN|5.0|I saw this for sale just after Mr. Brubeck's passing. My son is a budding jazz disciple and I thought this cd would be a great introduction of him to the Dave Brubeck catalog.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I gave this watch 5 stars because it exceeded my expectations based on some negative reviews, but it depends on your own expectations. Some things to consider:<br />1. This is on the smaller side for a man's watch, except the thickness, which is on the large side (relatively speaking compared to a quartz watch). Check out the measurements on Amazon for this watch against a watch you already have to get a better idea if it works for you.<br />2. If you are going  to have an automatic watch you should also be prepared to purchase an automatic winder. This will cost about $35 and up and doesn't use much electricity. Also, a Seiko automatic is different than a Seiko kinetic watch. Automatics don't have a power source, but store potential energy for a certain period of time by moving the watch, which causes a spinner to wind the watch. For me, the capacity is about 6-8 hours for this watch with no motion after a full charge (about 8 hours). This can vary by person. Some automatics have greater storage capacity. I have to wear it pretty much all day, including sleep, to keep it from running down. That's not practical, so I use a winder.<br />FYI - Kinetic watches have a power source that is replenished with motion and do not respond well to regular automatic winders.<br />  Eco drive watches have a power source that is replenished by light.<br />  Manual watches need winding. I have also heard of manual/automatic hybrids.<br />  Of course, a standard quartz watch has a battery that has to be replaced every several years.<br />3. The band looks like canvas, but it is nylon. It is also as thick as canvas, but wears better, so it is OK with me.<br />4. The second hand has a sweep motion, but it is not perfectly smooth.<br /><br />This is an excellent casual watch for me. It's neutral colors work with my casual clothes.<br />I have not had a problem with the day of the week turning over, but have noticed it happens slowly between 1-3 a.m for me.<br />I guess this is why the instructions say not to set the watch between 9 p.m and 3 a.m.<br /><br />This is my first automatic and I like it so much I am going to buy an automatic dress watch. They are usually thicker and not as accurate as other watches, but the accuracy is close, and I like the concept and symbiosis of an automatic timepiece.<br /><br />The time keeping on this watch is not as bad for me as I have read in other reviews. I am also not a stickler for perfect time. I usually keep my quartz watches a little fast.<br /><br />I like the idea of not having to ever replace a power source. It's my understanding that even with a Kinetic or Eco drive watch, the battery will eventually have to be replaced if you keep the watch long enough. They run down like all rechargeable batteries.<br /><br />All of my quartz watches have eventually stopped running even when the battery is not dead and again a few years after cleaning. That includes one of the first Seiko perpetual calendar watches that was my favorite.<br />My theory is that each time a watch case is opened, it  is exposed to particulate matter that eventually interferes with the internal timekeeping.<br /><br />Long live the automatic! (I hope)<br /><br />Update 11/05/13: I was told by a really good watch repair guy, who called his watchmaker mentor, who said automatic watches should not need adjustments of the movements to keep better time. One of the reasons that automatics last so long is when they are never opened. Whenever a watch is opened for any reason, unless it is in a white room environment, it will be exposed to particulate matter in the air, which eventually will gum up the works.<br />I have found that this watch keeps better time if you wind it manually by shaking it back and forth for about 20 seconds per day and a little longer on days you don't wear it. If you use an auto-winder, shake it before you put it in. It remains more accurate for me when I do this.<br />I am still very happy with the watch and receive many compliments when I wear it.<br />P.S. The band cleans up nicely with a little soap and water.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the sounds it includes. It's so fun to blend the sounds together. My favorite sounds are: Zen, Medieval, Monk Chant, Orchestral, and Imersed.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game has some challenging puzzles. the graphics are pleasant colors and easy to look at.  I am enjoying it
0307390349|1.0|I found each story more depressing and depraved than the last. Partway into the fifth story I simply closed the book with no intention of reading any further. I don't need fiction to be so disturbing and ugly. Too much happiness? That must have been an inside joke. I, for one, don't get it.
B00129H7VS|5.0|We have watched this series many times and really enjoy it so much.  It is well done and very informative.  I'm sure it will be watched many more time in the future.
B0047WJ11G|5.0|all the actors in this movie are great and the movie has a great story line. Once you put the movie in your drawn into it tell the very end. It feels likr your in the movie
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mojang has truly outdone itself with this game. I think being able to move minecraft to mobile devices is truly remarkable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read the book in one day as did many of the reviewers.  Could not put it down except to do essentials like sleep.  Story line was soo well done.  Kept me guessing the whole time as to everyone's motives and who was actually the bad guy or guys in this story.<br />I am very past the age of YA literature or stories but have read many of the popular series lately such as Twilight, Hungar Games, and FiftynShades.  There were more twists and turns in the plot in this story with more likable and relatable characters.  This would be a great movie as it really was an engrossing read!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I can't wait for the movie to come out. Nicholas Sparks books are always a good read. Wish the story had continued a little more.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book wouldn't` let me stop reading, you just had to keep reading to find out what happens next and its just really interesting to read. I seriously recommend this book to read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a fun game!  I only wish they had one that gave didn't require buying coins if u want to play for a while!
B0085KGHI6|4.0|it was great to watch muddy waters and the rolling stones.<br />also buddy guy and all there friends .good buy
B00992CF6W|3.0|block story is cheaper and it has more things to it but don't get me wrong minecraft is a good game
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Great fun for two animals lovers like us.  Fun features and different environments.  She has found several fun features on her own and reading hints is a good vocabulary experience for her.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Overall this is an entertaining read.  The first book is a little predictable and uncreative, and I will admit I had second thoughts about my purchase after finishing the first installment.  However, the series really picks up momentum from there.  The story is unique and for me that kept me reading.  That said, while I enjoyed the series I felt the end of the final book was somewhat anticlimactic.  I also felt his imagery was a little lacking.  For those reasons I give the series a 4/5.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Really cool game. It didn't really follow the story, though. Really fun and action-filled. Batman was pretty cool. The fighting is cool.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really enjoy this game.It's been a lot of fun to learn and progress. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys spending time learning.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|I was totally blown away by how cartoonish this movie turned out to be. I had not seen it in the theatres and had thought it was ultra violent and revolved around these Jewish American soldiers killing Nazis. It is but it isn't. There's hardly any graphic violence which is fine by me but the plot is so stupid, it warrants an investigation into what Tarantino was thinking. I mean, the glorious Kill Bill this sure isn't.<br /><br />Sure, it's shot well but the whole convoluted basing the story around a movie screening is beyond industry navel gazing. Then, to top it off, (SPOILER ALERT) the fact Hitler gets killed simply by getting shot seems to make the whole two convergent \\"blow up the theatre\\" plots redundant.<br /><br />Honestly, the whole thing is a silly mess. Don't even get me started on the bierkeller scene which made no sense at all in the end or the beginning as to why they met there in the first place.<br /><br />The performances are first-rate especially Christoph Waltz as the \\"Jew Hunter\\" Colonel Hans Landa, even if the opening scene between a French farmer and the German Nazi is done in English after the most laughable request in the movie (\\"I hear you speak English. My French is not so good. Let's speak in English.\\") given the rest of the movie is a mix of plausible French, German, English but also implausible Italian.<br /><br />There also were zero extras on the single-disc DVD I watched.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I was so sure that all the good parts had been shown in the previews that I was skeptical going into this movie.  There are so many other great parts and funny lines that you are reminded just how well of a comedic actor Mark Wahlberg is.  Definitely worth the rental.
B004DM0UII|4.0|I like the interface.  It makes getting to shoutcast stations much easier. I'm glad I got it as a FAOTD, I don't know if I'd have paid for it since I have Pandora and Slacker.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Lots of twists and turns to the plot! It's sci-fi, Alfred Hitchcock and Stephen king all in one!!! Must read!
B00597A6NU|4.0|Good film from an historical perspective.  Hollywood didn't screw it up too bad. I don't have 7 more required words!!!!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|The premise is interesting and the make up artists did a good job making Joseph Gordon-Levitt look like Bruce Willis and he did a good job mimicking some of Bruce's mannerisms and expressions that he is famous for.  The story line is a little weak though.  The ending could have been so much better and stronger.  If you're  fan of Bruce Willis, futuristic movies like Total Recall you might enjoy it.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|If you know how to use the Windows file manager on a PC, then you already know how to use this app.<br /><br />I was specifically looking for a way to drag and drop files between the shared drives on my home wireless network and my Kindle Fire. This app works perfectly for that function.<br /><br />I use it like this... I have all my digital copies of my movies on the shared drive of my PC, and mirrored in my 120G media player. Due to limited hard drive space on my Kindle Fire, I like to keep one movie at a time on the Kindle. When I want a different movie on my Kindle I simply enter the ES File explorer on the Kindle, and delete the movie already on there. This is incredibly simple to do on this app. Then I access my shared drive on my home network using the ES File Explorer and drag another movie into the Kindle. Incredibly simple to do. I was literally performing this action within 2 min of opening the app for the very first time.<br /><br />The cherry on top? This app is free. I can't recommend it enough.

B009AMANBA|5.0|The word FREEDOOM means so much more to me now after watching this movie. This movie is about our 16th president Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) felt that slavery is wrong so he led the Union (non-slavery states) to fight the slavery states to end slavery. This is our country's civil war. The civil war is going strong and many soldiers die from both Union States and Non Union States. Everybody wants the war to end. However, President Lincoln needs to pass the 13th amendment to outlaw slavery before he ends the war. This movie really brings our history to life. I did not understand fully what slavery is all about. Watching this movie helps me understand and realize how import freedom is. So many soldiers died for freedom.<br /><br />The actors in this movie are awesome. Daniel Day-Lewis did an excellent job of portraying Mr. Lincoln. His mannerism and movements are so like the 1800s. It seems like they made him a little bit taller. Tommy Lee Jones does an excellent job portraying Thaddeus Stevens. Also, Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln totally fits the role. The make-up and wardrobes are so unbelievable. Daniel Day-Lewis looks just like Mr. Lincoln with all the lines on his forehead and the wrinkle skin. The most amazing make-up is Thaddeus Stevens.<br /><br />The cinematography in this movie is mostly done in natural light. In 1865 there is no electricity, so the setting must be dark with candles as light. My favorite part of this movie is when the politicians are bargaining for votes. My favorite character is Mr. Lincoln.  He holds his emotions so well. He has a goal of passing the 13th amendment and he did his best to pass it and end the war. He instructs his general to treat the enemy with respect and release them to go home and not to jail. He is such an awesome person.<br /><br />I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 and up due to some body parts and blood. Cheyenne N, KIDS FIRST!

B00AMBH70S|3.0|The only thing that makes this different than the Matt Damon Bourne saga is that Jeremy Renner never loses his memory.  Typical Bourne action.  Typical Bourne love interests.  They could have expanded on the story line a bit more to show a little more depth, and it's set up for yet another Bourne movie at the end.

B005IA9JZO|5.0|Tick Tock Tick Tock hum Who is afraid of this noise? The great Capitan James Hook (Dustin Hoffman). He is lonely and misses his rival Peter Pan. Peter is all grown up with a wife and two children living a normal life. When he goes to London to visit Wendy who found him a family when he had none, Hook steals his children. Peter has forgotten all about Neverland. Tinker Bell (Julia Roberts) who still adores Peter Pan comes to the rescue and flies him back to Neverland. He cannot fly anymore because he has forgotten how. Hook is sadly disappointed to find that Peter is all grown up and has forgotten how to play, much less fight. Tinker Bell has three days to get Peter Pan back in shape. He has been gone a long time and the Lost Boys have a new leader Rufio. They do not believe that Robin Williams is Pan the Man.<br /><br />My favorite scene was the food fight. It was funny and a great idea. In order to have food you have to imagine what you want to eat, and there it is. If you lose your imagination, you will just be hungry. I love the mermaids. They look so real. Tinker Bell is my favorite character because she is the cutest pixie ever. She is small, could fly and has an adorable house. Captain Hook is the best I have ever seen. He is funny yet has a mean streak. Snead (Bob Hoskins) the Captain's assistant is played perfectly and Hook would be no where without him. Steven Spielberg makes another movie which has me laughing, crying and cheering. There are the coolest sets. The great pirate ship, the Lost Boys hideout and Tinker Bell's space are all done with great detail. Everything looks real and I wanted to jump through the screen and learn how to fly and live there for a while. It looks like I always imagined it would. Second star to the right and fly on until morning. The costume designers and make-up artists are outstanding. They do a believable job of making all characters look perfect. Is Peter Pan ever going to remember how to fly so he can rescue his children from the pirates? Yes, there are a lot of pirates.<br /><br />Children and adults of all ages will love this movie. The age range is 6 and up. I give this movie 5 twinkling stars because it brought a cartoon I love and made it real. Morgan B, KIDS FIRST!

B00ARAO720|3.0|Fun movie and interesting fact you learn during credits is Joseph Gordon-Levitt did all the riding in the movie.  I would have liked to have seen more of the trick riding and crazy stunts that they allude to in the story line, but that's because we're a BMX racing family.  Not a bad way to spend the evening though.
B008W31IFS|2.0|How delicious to open a new Michael Connelly book.  How disappointing to wait and wait for the engagement to start.  This book never got there for me.  It feels phoned in, in spite of what a good writer Connelly is.  Let us hope the next one goes back to being engrossing and entertaining.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this story as much or more than Slammed and Point of No Retreat. College Hoover certainly knows how to tell a great story that you could loose yourself in.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The epic musical Les Miserables tells the story of a man named jean Valjean played by Hugh Jackman set during the dawn of the French revolution. After serving 19 years as a slave because he stole a loaf of bread, he breaks parole and spends years reinventing himself as a new man. Jean is being hunted by officer Javert played by Russell Crowe, who swears he will not rest until Jean is behind bars. While running from Javert, Jean Valjean finds himself caring for a factory workers young daughter, Cosette. The young child changes his life forever.<br /><br />Les Miserables is honestly one of the greatest films I have ever seen. This film is almost three hours long and I still wanted it to go on longer. Les Miserables is a very well known Broadway musical and the film stays so true to the play it is unbelievable. Not a single word is off. However, the one thing that changes for the better is that the movie version makes the story easier to understand and follow. I have been a huge fan of Les Mis for a long time and I know almost every single song by heart. I was trying so hard not to start singing along with the film. The musical score was amazing.<br /><br />The whole film is better than I could have ever hoped for, but seeing this tale up on the big screen is phenomenal! The visuals and special effects are truly breathtaking. It is set in France at the beginning of the French revolution when life for the poor was awful and life for the rich was grand. They capture the hard times of the streets perfectly by using dark colors and wonderful lighting contrasts. I loved seeing the world of Les Mis on a grand scale and exactly as I imagined it.<br /><br />I love this entire movie so much that when it was over I immediately wanted to see it again. I'm definitely going to see it again when it comes out in theaters. I have so many scenes that I love so much, but my favorites are the Lovely Ladies' scene and the Master of the House scene. I like the Lovely Ladies scene because that's where Fantine, Cosette's mother turns to the streets as a home after losing her job at the factory. It is a wonderful musical number and Anne Hathaway's performance is amazing! (Oscar Award for Best Supporting Actress) It is so historically accurate showing how people would do anything to make a quick penny from selling their teeth, to chopping off their hair. It was hard for everyone. I also love the Master of the House scene because it is so hilarious with Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as the innkeeper and his wife. They con people into staying the night at their inn, then trick them into never leaving. They are so crafty and hilarious and they rob everyone blind. This scene is so clever and hilarious. Sacha and Helena make an amazing duo.<br /><br />I love all of the characters equally, but I'll only pick a few to talk about. Jean Valjean is a truly amazing character and Hugh Jackman brings him to life so well. Hugh's talents are really shown off during this film and I was very impressed by him. Fantine, played by the remarkable Anne Hathaway is a very memorable character. Anne is perfect as Fantine and this was, in my opinion, her best role. The last character that I really enjoyed is Eponine played by Samantha Barks. Eponine sings all of my favorite Les Mis songs and her incredible duo of A Little Fall of Rain with Eddie Redmayne. A little fun fact is that Samantha Marks played Eponine in the Broadway version of Les Mis.<br /><br />I give Les Miserables 5 out of 5 stars because it is truly the most amazing film I've seen in a long time and it far surpassed my expectations. This film is definitely for ages 13 and up because of the dark period it is set in and the violence and cruelty that occurs. Raven D, KIDS FIRST!

B00APUYWYA|4.0|The music is fun, the cameos are fun, the comedy provided by Rebel Wilson totally makes it worth it.  Even my husband admitted it wasn't that bad.  If you like music, Glee, and girl power then check this movie out.  You won't regret it.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I don't have much to say, just like this cliche' riddled crap ball of a waste of money and time. Give your money to your dog and let him bury it in the yard, you'll have more fun and your dog will get some exercise.
B007SGM084|4.0|Despite all of the negative reviews this book has a really good plot. There needs to be more. I just want to know  what happens next.
0062197266|4.0|To start with, I'd like to say that I was tickled to discover that the author started this novel during National Novel Writing Month, an event that our library has participated in the last few years.<br /><br />The book is a fairly basic story: girl meets man of her dreams, he turns out to be a monster in disguise, and she has to escape and/or be saved. What I liked about this book is that it was more complicated that the average thriller with this rather standard plot. The author has really looked at her subject matter and taken it quite seriously, while not compromising the tension that makes for a good \\"thriller\\". This book deals as much with the aftermath of abusive relationships as it does with the relationship itself. Haynes does a nice job dealing with issues of OCD and PTSD.<br /><br />This book is soooo compelling, but it is also difficult to read. I was engrossed enough that I read the 400 page book in nearly one sitting, however, I had to get up from time to time and take small breaks just because the subject matter was so horrific that I needed to remind myself that I was safe at home with my nice, non-violent husband. That being said, I highly recommend it. It makes you ask yourself a lot of questions about the psychology of human beings and the relationships between men and women. If she keeps this up, Haynes is going to be a powerful novelist, indeed.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|Typical Resident Evil where Alice is the only character that can really kick some butt and do some damage.  Slow moving story line with predictable outcome.  Showed the good parts in the previews.  Avoid it or wait until it's on sale to rent/buy.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this app. I have it on my Iphone &amp; thought I would try it on my Kindle Fire. It's great I can sync whatever I have noted on both my Iphone &amp; my Kindle that way it doesn't matter which of them I am using at the time. I can always access my notes. I am new at using it right now so I know I have much more to learn on it. I like the fact that if someone recommends good reading material I can add it to my list in my notes no matter which device I am using at the time and know it will be available to me on the device of my choice. I can also access it on my tablet or PC. Best of all it's a free app. Keep up the good work!

B000YHG72E|4.0|My family enjoyed this movie about the misfit Elf seeking to find a connection to the outside world.  Overall, the acting was good, the story line moved along, and the messaging was nice.  There are good laughs.  James Caan and Will Ferrell do a great job.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|If you are a lover of the Dark Knight you'll appreciate this movie.  Personally I thought it dragged in a few places and there was a bit more editing that could have been done.  Christian Bale does a good job and surprisingly so does Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is set up to become Knight WIng (Now that's a movie I'd like to see).
B00684J49U|2.0|I didn't like this season too much. If Patrick Dempsey were not in it I probably wouldn't watch it at all.  I hated it when they killed off Mark and Lexie that was just wrong on so many levels. I tried to watch the season again last night and I couldnt get the DVD's to play and I have a new DVD player, I am also having the same problem with season 3.  I am rethinking buying season 9 because I purchase all my dvd's new and after a few months they stop playing.
B00AEKFLOQ|5.0|I purchased this movie because when I went to it at the theater, I was just amazed. I have the first 2 in the steelbook as well.
B001EC3JME|4.0|I used this for many months on patrol with an aircraft aluminum flashlight.  It rotates nice and fit on my duty belt snugly. My only complaint is over time the flashlight will slide down further into the holder.  I recommend if you use this get a light with an oversized head to prevent.  It was only a minor inconvenience, and would still recommend it.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|My sister bought this for me as a Christmas gift, I asked for the receipt. When I first heard Friends was coming out on Blu-ray I thought \\"FINALLY! I can get rid of my DVD's & have every episode that's on them in High Definition!\\" then Warner released the press info that indicated the set would only have the \\"Original Broadcast Episodes\\". Then responded saying the Extended footage wasn't available in a format that could benefit from a Blu-ray release. Bull, they just didn't want to spend the money & time to get the 35mm film for those scenes, rescan them in high definition & edit them back into the Broadcast versions that they already had complete masters for to use for syndication. If they can go back and rescan scenes that looked blurry on TV & look fantastic on the Blu-ray, they could have done the same with the extended scenes. I don't care what anyone says, the broadcast versions are not the ones we were \\"Meant to see\\". They were the ones we HAD to see due to time restrictions. I became a fan of Friends by buying & watching the DVD's, Warner should have put into consideration that a lot of fans would want an exact upgrade in terms of episode content from DVD to Blu-ray.
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|What can I say? The Idea of the film was interesting BUT...(and I feel so disloyal for saying this) I have long suspected that Robert Pattinson was not very intelligent, he giggles during interviews and looks down at his shoes-alot. The woman he chooses to be with is shallow and inarticulate-just when people are starting to like her again, she opens her mouth and says something stupid and arrogant, when she is not dropping the F-Bomb three times in each sentence. My point is- an intelligent man would need to be with someone who had some depth to them. He is beautiful to look at and was born to play Edward Cullen (as Christopher Reeves was born to play Superman) sometimes an actor and a role just \\"click\\" But I'm afraid he just didn't have the intellectual depth to make this role work, he was outclassed (and out -acted ) by every single person who got into that car! Most (not all) of the people in the film were robotic and talked in a monotone  ,I understand this was done for effect -but in R-Patz case, he did it because there wasn't a single thought rolling around in that gorgeous head of his  and you could see it in his eyes. An actor was needed who could act cold and  removed -  emotionally and morally bankrupt, yet convey that there were oceans of seething emotions going on underneath all that cold detachment. Robert ( I'm saddened to say) was badly out of his depth. The stilted dialog just didn't work and was laughably bad at times. An Actor who could have conveyed \\"layers\\"of emotion might have made this film interesting, as it was-it was a cinematic dry-hump; painfully frustating with no release. I might have enjoyed it if I was on 'shrooms. Sorry Robert this SUCKED BIG-TIME !!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i like it me and my son play it alot and i like how you  get to bet people scroe its cool

B001UHOWXI|5.0|I bought this movie for my parents who after many many years finally updated their TV and VCR.  They now have a Blue Ray player and always watch this movie on Christmas Eve.  I bought this movie for them as an early Christmas present.  It came on time and played great.

B0016KJKIG|5.0|Been wearing it 5 days a week for a long time now and this sheath is a godsend. It holds my bit-kit, saw and file holder, bit extender, and a 1/4&#34; drive 11/32&#34; hex drive bit. Have lost none of them. It is beginning to show some wear and shape-shifting, as nylon will do. I just can't believe I haven't lost the bit extender or 11/32&#34; yet. Cleaning pools, jumping in mud pits, crawling under houses and through 30 year old attics I would have expected to lose some things. Haven't yet.<br /><br />The only issue I have with it is the failing Velcro. But I imagine that is the nature of Velcro when you open and close it a hundred times in a day (at least). It doesn't get clogged with lint so much as the loops just wear out. I shaved back a section of the original and sewed some new 3M Velcro loop patch on the flap but even that has worn out now.<br /><br />At any rate, I bought 2 of these when I bought them initially because... in maintenance, things break. But you maintain.

Shaun and his buddy work to rescue Shaun's girlfrind and his parents and take them to what they think would be a safe haven. The zombies drive the story forward and provide a bunch of hillarious situations as Shaun and his buddy try to be heros instead of zeros.

I like this feature.  I didn't know that it was only one a month, but I can live with that ! I also bought the Anti-Glare screen and the Zip Sleeve to keep it safe.  Both are worth the price.  Enjoy
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book.  I listened to it as an Audible audiobook and Wil Wheaton was a fantastic narrator.  A great book for anyone - you don't have to be a videogame or 80s buff to enjoy it.
B008KNUKVI|3.0|I really enjoy what this band does so I purchased the album to support them.  That being said I think their style only translates well to certain songs so I enjoy a couple songs on the album much more than others.  Other than that they're an awesome band and it was a worthwhile buy!
0374214913|4.0|I admit it. I picked up this book because I really liked the title. At first, it didn't wow me. I felt like Sloan was just trying too hard to be hip. While I never shook that feeling entirely, I did grow to enjoy Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore as I read it, probably because I'm a book geek. For example, the early printer Aldus Manutius plays a big role in the plot. I'm the book geek who actually knew who he was, and what his printer's device looks like, before I picked this up. Apparently, I'm the target demographic for this story.<br /><br />At the heart of the plot is the question of the meaning of technology in our shared cultural legacy. Or, how do print books and their history have any meaning in an age where pages can be quickly scanned, OCR-ed (Optical Character Recognition), and the individual characters themselves spit back out as a visualized data? When all of our information is scanned, stored, manipulated, what are we left with? And why have print books at all? Sloan uses the plot to tease and prod these questions, and while you won't get any answers, I walked away feeling like digital technology and rare texts can happily coexist and compliment each other. That is, I walked away with the same opinion I walked in with.<br /><br />There are some quirky, cool characters. Strike that -- all of the characters are quirky and cool. This book is hipster heaven. There's the guy who works at Industrial Light and Magic. The best friend gamer geek who owns a software company. The girlfriend who works at Google and wears the same shirt everyday. With each new character, there was a new person to either embrace or roll your eyes at. I decided to go with it and embrace rather than scoff.<br /><br />Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore won't be for everyone, but this is recommended for those who like geekiness spread on thick, who have more books than friends, who enjoy biblio-mysteries, and who believe that books can hold the secret to immortality.<br /><br />P.S. Apparently the cover glows in the dark. Sadly, I didn't discover this until I'd returned it to the library, otherwise I'd have had a rad bedtime experience.

0765325950|1.0|I am very disappointed by the lack of an eBook. I would have happily paid the same price for an eBook as the hardcover version, I simply much prefer using my Kindle to read books, as opposed to lugging around a 900 page monster. Whoever made this decision really needs to rethink it, and should be happy that this is the last book in the series - you have put a very foul taste in my mouth when it comes to purchasing novels.

The photographs sprinkled throughout the book, allow you to match your imagination with that of the Author. It was unexpected fun and excitement and surely there will be a sequel. I would recommend this book for all through young adults.

B004EPZ070|3.0|Opinion is based soely on the movie content. Actual DVD arrived a great condition and works great and bought as a gift - just did not care for the movie itself - could have been better!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I haven't finished it yet, but what I have read so far has greatly helped me already. I love this book.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|I would recommend this product. It is varied enough to keep their interest but very user friendly. He can do it all by himself.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Great Musical. Loved Queen Latifa as the warden. Music is amazing abd unforgettable. Worth the money. Did buy it off Amazon. Came fast and It was like new.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I ordered the sample of this book, I thought &#34;Here we go again with more of this Twilighty teenage stuff.&#34;  Even though the sample was not especially riveting, I decided $4 was a decent price and ordered it.  I actually really liked this book, and think it is a fantastic book that may not be suitable for teenagers at all.  The only reason this book got one star reviews is that some of the material (which I won't describe to prevent spoilers) was deemed inappropriate and the readers should have been warned about the content.  Not if you wanted to be surprised!  The clues are easy to interpret so it's your own fault if you kept reading.  The only reason I did not want to give this book 5 stars is that I agree with some reviewers that the teenagers in this book do not act their age, and also that the build up that took place during 85% of this book led to a poor resolution in my eyes.  I thought the end was a bit weak.  But I would say 25-95% of this book is worth 5 stars or more, so I couldn't find myself giving it a rating less than that.  There is a reason why this book is on the best sellers list!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|After I read another clever, star themed novel, [[ASIN:1460985826 My Life on Craigslist: Finalist of USA Book Awards]] - which I really loved and I highly recommend - I picked up this book because it was shown that customers who read My Life on Craigslist, also read this. I am not a YA fan and I shy away from books with too many reviews, but I am glad I picked it up. I think anybody who is like me and who likes books that really make you think about life, death, love, and our place under the stars would enjoy this book. Great read! Can't wait to read another book by this author.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard this was just soft porn but I beg to differ. If you read past the &#34;Dominant&#34; &#34;Submisive&#34; subject you see a touching emotional story of love and a young ladies unusual sexual awakening.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Sheesh, what dribble..save your money, not even entertaining. Local book club is in agreement with me on this. Suprising what people can get published.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I read the sample of this book and thought it was ridiculously stupid, but bought it despite my intuition based on the reviews.  I want my time and money back!  I read it in less than four hours and regret buying it.  I gave it two stars only because one part made me tear up and one part made me laugh, but the rest of the book was a waste.  I don't see how anyone could say this is a stunning and life changing story.  I honestly thought that he was &#34;special&#34; and didn't know it, but the ending describes his weird behavior as caused by something else entirely.  I just didn't get it, and I read a lot so I don't misunderstand books very often.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|The world of Crystal Castles can be intimidating, but III is their most accessible album yet.  The chip-tune sounds of their debut are nowhere to be found here.  Instead, Kath and Glass have followed up their excellent 2010 album by once again marrying despair and rhythm - evolving their sound to a something even more exhilarating.  It may not be for everyone - but let it grow on you before you make up your mind.  At 40 minutes long, it left me wanting more.  &#34;Plague,&#34; &#34;Affection,&#34; &#34;Sad Eyes,&#34; and &#34;Mercenary&#34; are immediate standouts, but there's not a moment of filler on this tight, focused work of art.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Totally unbelievable, coincidences are a sign of a lazy author who did not want to find a plausible reason for a situation. Just bad.
B000V86OKG|4.0|Good price and made a great gift. I don't really care for the show, so I'm not going to give 5 stars.... but otherwise a good value!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I downloaded this book the minute I finished the first one.  I found it quite predictable, but still more interesting than I thought it was going to be.  I wasn't too happy with the ending though.. it felt rushed.  I heard the third book is terrible and my friend gave me all the details so I probably won't read it, but I think this book is necessary to read after the first and it's a good price for the kindle.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Having read all of Kate Morton's novels, she's become one of my favorite authors and I expect always will be. The Secret Keeper is  a page turner with plenty of twists that transports the reader back in time. The book jumps back and forth between 1941 and 2011, but it flows consistently. Morton's insight into human nature and her development of the main characters intrigues. This novel however, lacks some of the beautiful descriptive prose I enjoyed so much in her previous novels, and that's why I'm giving it four stars.
B001NHNG64|1.0|I read two of them. I though maybe the first one (which I hated) was an anomaly, after all, so many people like it. Nope, the books suck. Totally unbelievable: characters, settings, and situations.
B004NDVJA0|5.0|Found this album via a friend of Spotify and haven't been able to stop listening since. Her voice is hypnotic and wonderful.<br /><br />I am surprised she isn't bigger in the States yet!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My friends talked about this book nonstop and begged me to see the movie.  Even my brother, who hates anything related to teenage fantasy, said it was one of his favorite movies after his girlfriend dragged him to see it.  It looked dumb so I had no interest in it.  But I caved in and bought it because I wanted to read as much as possible before the Spring semester started, and found myself pleasantly surprised.  The story is futuristic, and yet so primitive, that I found myself involved in it.  The Games dragged on a bit in the middle, but it didn't stop me from wondering what I would do if it was my life.  I was able to visualize it and see things from the characters' points of view, and that's how I know it was a good book.
B005H29GSI|4.0|Its an addictive game, to enjoy with friends, family. The big bird its kind of tricky to throw, but a great game and a great gift
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Really like Ken Follett but like &#34;World without End&#34; his follow up here again lets the reader down. Still a good read and brutally honest but not near as good as book I of the centuryTrilogy. I hope book 3 is much better

B0091Q3254|5.0|Noel Gallagher in its best form, great concerts, and the demos CD is a must have for those who are Oasis/NGHFB fans!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am so impressed with this writer. Admittedly, I am a hopeless romantic and shamelessly seek a happy ending in everything I read. I bought this book and sat on it for quite a while knowing I would have to reconcile myself to the tears and sadness I knew would come.<br />Finally, last night I jumped in and while I wasn't wrong....the tears came as did the sadness... so did the laughter and the love. This book crazy smart, funny, and yes, heartbreaking.<br />I suspect I'll read it over and over...and recommend it often.<br />Truly terrific book, wow!!!!
B007FJFDXS|1.0|I don't know who waste his time making this application, and moreover, he is making me waste my time reviewing this!

B004LWZWGA|5.0|This Batman to me was the best and I enjoy it so much, I just had to add it to all my movies. 5 star winner in my book of super  guys you got to love. &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; .. the best of the best.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is quickly becoming my favorite author. She has wow'd me again with Hopeless. This is the first novel that has had me laugh out loud a lot and then realize I'm still grinning as I continue reading. The book does have a very sad turning point and a ton of surprises but also has a ton of sweetness. You fall in love with some of the characters, especially Holder...how could you not! Colleen Hoover is a very talented author and I look forward to more of her books in the future. Her novels Slammed and Point of Retreat are just as excellent, she has a true gift.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Free Angry Birds... Just amazing, funny and with many different (and complicated) levels to spent your time. Just like every Angry Birds game.
B00AAX68HG|1.0|I like the game, but I must admit I won't be playing it much. There are just too many ads for my liking and the cost of 4.99$ to get ad free version is asking way too much, I like it but not that much so I won't be upgrading and won't be playing too much.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Great game. First l have played of its kind. Very fun when not waiting. Players should be able to buy peanuts with coins earned in game.
8866130915|3.0|I honestly thought this product was large like other day planners instead it was quite small....a little too small for a college student. If I knew the dimensions of the product I wouldn't have purchased it, however that wasn't the case - the dimensions of said product were not in the description. Nor was there an accurate photo of the product being utilized or against something else to verify it's size. I feel rather misled, but I am not doing to return it because it does have use even if it is rather...small.<br /><br />However it still can be used and the stickers are very cute and useful! However I must warn people that this product though well made is rather small and is not for those who are college students. And would recommend something....larger in order to see what is written down.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The facebook app. You can do everything you need to do as in the website. For 5 stars it should be developed the interface a little bit.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading Slammed and Point of Retreat I knew I loved Colleen Hoover and would probably love anything else she ever wrote, but wow!! Hopeless exceeded all my expectations. Loved the flow of the story and how it all BAM came together at the end. Loved it, loved it, loved it!!! Thank you so much Colleen for such an amazing story :)

B004LWZW7E|5.0|Justin Timberlake as an actor has really impressed me. this was a movie that didn't get the hype it deserved.  i dare call it a family friendly flick.
1423151054|4.0|I love the entire idea behind this concept. I pre-ordered this set the moment it was available. But my set has a flaw!<br /><br />Maybe I'm alone, maybe I'm not. But the 'Thumper' flipbook (by Ollie Johnston) has quite a few pixelated drawings for a total of 7 frames. It's a bit distracting. It must be a print error, because the frames before it and after it look great. But these 7 frames are clearly digitally compressed, low-resolution JPEG images. I'll be contacting the publisher about the issue, maybe I just got unlucky. It's just a shame. The rest of the set is beautiful and I haven't noticed any issues with the rest.<br /><br />Besides the flaw: These flip books are wonderful. They are fun to watch again and again. They picked some wonderful scenes of animation. It just leaves me wanted more, much! I could spend all day looking at flipbooks like these. I know this was a personal pet project of Pete Doctor, well he really did a great job, they came out wonderful.<br /><br />The 45 page book / booklet that comes along with it is very nice too. It dedicates a few pages each to the Nine Old Men and gives a good insight into the animation process afterwards. There are some great sketches and drawings in this as well. This would be rated 5 stars if my copy wasn't flawed.
0525953728|5.0|Terrific book - highly recommended to anyone with an interest in the current state of the war on terror and covert operations.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder by R.J. Palacio is honestly the best book I've ever read. It's funny, sad, realistic, and easy to relate to. It's surprising and just AMAZING. :)
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|fun game ending was a bit simple. acting was only ok. but liked the story line. may play again. it was almost worth the 3 bucks
1599290634|5.0|This series of books probably demonstrates the huge range of the human imagination. The variety of subject matter should have something to appeal to just about every art taste. I purchase these books for ideas as much as their outright beauty.  A good source for motivation and ideas. A great source for just admiration and contemplation. I highly recommend it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It is not a well written murder mystery. It jumps around too much you go from husband's opinions to wife's diary about their life together.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book!! I didn't want to put it down at all :) plus I fell in love with Connor!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|You can not go wrong with any Angry Birds app; however this one is really enjoyable as it has the actual music from Star Wars. Which happens to sound great on my HD Kindle!!!
B006O6F932|4.0|My two daughters received this for Christmas. They have spent several hours playing with it. It's great imaginative play for them. The only problem I have, is that it's hard for them to close the set up on their own.

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|someone else wrote cogently , &#34;funny with heart&#34; and I agree. It was ridiculously stupid in some scenes (that poop in the living room) but LOL funny in many others. And it did have love in it that wasn't too trite. I recommend.
B00AKNYBRK|5.0|I have been a BIG FAN of these two for the past 25 + years, since West End Girls came out on the radio in the early 1980's. These guys can do no wrong with any song they make, even the \\"B sides\\" are Brilliant (get the CD \\"Format' is all of the \\"B\\" side for the past 25 years and it is a must have for the collection.<br />This track is one of the best on the new album and I love this remix as it is a little more upbeat the original but still clean and neat. I love the 3 extra tracks which is like a bonus when you purchase any PSB album or remixes. Love the BIZARRE cover of this one as well. Neil and Chris I hope you both keep doing this for many years to come. Every time you put new music out it's like Christmas morning for me. Thanks for your years of great music and keeping the 80's alive.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Does just what it says it does. I also really like the feature that starts the alarm off quiet and gradually increases volume; good selection of tones
B005K15SPG|5.0|I have already listened to all the songs on utube and decided to get the album. Really enjoy them. My best music purchase in 2012.
0061537969|5.0|As an owner of a dog, I felt this book particulary compelling; but it's not just for dog owners. It's well written and a fast read with several great metaphors that are worthy of highlighting. A great book club read!
B0060D11OU|4.0|This film is still a classic, so I'm only giving this 4 stars because though it has a big &#34;HD&#34; ribbon on the corner of it's displayed product picture and didn't offer seperate SD/HD versions when I bought it on PC, it only plays in SD on the Amazon VOD app for Xbox.<br /><br />Sigh.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is the best thing I have seen in YEARS. I can't stop watching it!  Not since Brideshead Revistied have I gotten this involved with a series.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Love the album. Bought this together with their other album, Sigh No More. Package arrived safely and on time. No damage whatsoever. Great buy.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It was okay. It was a desparate attempt to include another addition to the film series.  With that said it was entertaining, but nothing more than a different angle of the series, and it technically ran parallel to the previous entry. Either way, it was okay, and was dissapointed but eh, goes to show there is such a thing as too many sequels.<br /><br />In short, you won't find an oscar film in this, but action nonetheless.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This is one of my top favorites right next to Torch Song Trilogy, Priscilla Queen of The Desert, and To Wong Fu!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What can I say, if you haven't read \\"The Hunger Games Trilogy\\" you're missing out on some of the best books I've ever read. I thoroughly enjoyed reading each book and would read them over and over again. These books have out done the movie, like they normally do! It was suspenseful and kept me on my toes. I wasn't sure what was going to happen next...it's a trilogy that will make you join in on the Hunger Games!

B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I really loved the movie and couldn't wait to re-listen to all of the actor's renditions of the songs. This collection was high quality and the songs were edited to near perfection. My main issue is that there was a couple songs that weren't included in the collection that I really enjoyed (Can you hear the people sing). Another issue is that one or two of the songs had some parts omitted, including the majority of 'Look Down' and parts of 'Master of The House'
8866131369|5.0|I love this book, it is so handy to have 18mos. view.  For the pages that I don't use, I use to write notes and things that I don't want to forget.  Also nothing like having a analog backup to one's digital life.

B005OK725M|5.0|I normally don't think of Zoe Saldana as action genre actor, but she was more than worthy in this role.  Non-stop action with unexpected twist and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie.  Well worth the watch.

For gaming purposes, many recommend this processor and the X79 chipset over a 3770k processor for roughly the same price.  You will not be disappointed with this processor.

Only issue I have is that I have to wait so long for the 3rd book!!!

0307592731|5.0|Not many books have me crying by page 24 but Wild by Cheryl Strayed certainly did.<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed is a woman on a journey, one about determination, life and finding yourself.  In Wild, Cheryl captures love, family, friends, relationships and accounts of loss, both mentally and physically, in a way that takes one to hell and back with mixed emotions. At the end of Wild I was left feeling exhilarated, empowered and in awe of this woman's strength and commitment. If Cheryl Strayed can walk eleven hundred miles alone then my goals in life can also be achieved.<br /><br />'At twenty-six, Cheryl Strayed though she had lost everything. In the wake of her mother's rapid death from cancer, her family grew apart and her marriage soon crumbled. With seemingly nothing to lose, she made the most impulsive decisions in her life: to walk eleven-hundred miles of the west coast of America - from the Mojave Desert, through California and Oregon, and into Washington State - and to do it alone. She had no experience of long-distance hiking and the journey was nothing more than a line on a map. But it held a promise - a promise of piecing together a life that lay shattered at her feet.<br /><br />Strayed's account captures the agonies - both physical and mental - of her incredible journey; hit it maddened and terrified her, and how, ultimately, it healed her. Wild is a brutal memoir of survival, grief and redemption; a searing portrayal of life at its lowest ebb and at its highest tide.'<br /><br />Cheryl Strayed writes with consistent flow and humor yet provides seriousness to the reality of life. At times she is able to laugh at, and with, herself and the ridiculousness of her life and thoughts.  You see her  as a 'normal' woman with thoughts, feelings and impulses that make you realise that we are all only limited to how we see ourselves and what is put in front of us.<br /><br />\\" I scooted over the carpet and situated myself on my rump right in front of my pack, wove my arms through the shoulder straps, and clipped the sternum strap across my chest. I took a deep breath and began rocking back and forth to gain momentum, until finally I hurled myself forward with everything in me and got myself onto my hands and knees. My backpack was no longer on the floor. It was officially attached to me. It still seemed like a Volkswagen Beetle, only now it seemed like a Volkswagen Beetle that was parked on my back. I stayed there for a few moments, trying to get my balance. Slowly, I worked my feet beneath me while simultaneously scaling the metal cooling unit with my hands until I was vertical enough that I could do a dead lift. The frame of the pack squeaked as I rose, it too straining from the tremendous weight. By the time I was standing - which is to say, hunching in a remotely upright position - I was holding the vented metal panell that I'd accidentally ripped loose from the cooling unit in my efforts\\" (pg 43)<br /><br />Thus starts the journey of Cheryl Strayed, her 'Volkswagen Beetle' back pack and those she meets.<br /><br />Wild contains important and thought provoking messages for all. It provides an insight into the way we look at life and those who pass by us, some staying for a long time, others blessing us for only a moment. It made me think about the things I take for granted and had me assessing my life based on the experiences of Cheryl<br /><br />On page 143 Cheryl writes \\"That perhaps being amidst the undesecrated beauty of the wilderness meant that I too could be undesecrated, regardless of what I'd lost or what had been taken from me, regardless of the regrettable things I'd done to others or myself or the regrettable things that had been done to me. Of all the things I'd been skeptical about, I didn't feel skeptical about this: the wilderness had a clarity that included me\\"<br /><br />Writing on the day before the fourth of July and with certainty that her friends would be having parties and attending parades, Cheryl brings home the reality that we are 'no more or less significant than a single one of the nameless birds in the trees.'<br /><br />I found myself engrossed in every page and every word that I read. I laughed, I cried and I felt every emotion with Cheryl. Already on Oprah's Book Club 2.0 inaugural selection of books list l SI would definitely place Wild in the top five of my best read books of 2012. I was never lost whilst reading Wild but definitely found myself  by the time I had finished.ngs home the reality that we are 'no more or less significant than a single one of the nameless birds in the trees.'<br /><br />I found myself engrossed in every page and every word that I read.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|.Fast acting.,fast loads ...my grandsons loves it.  Grandma too. Keeps you busy trying to get a better score so you can get different characters
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy to use. The best option is being able to sync it from every device. Also, the ability to organize that simply astonished me.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I have always liked Rod Stewart, as his voice is like none others. I also really enjoyed the selection of music.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I got the item I wanted in a timely fashion, that's all I ask for.So often thing are miss listed or labeled, but these were right.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|The Great cast<br />Lots of Action<br />I really enjoyed this movie so much, I got both of the DVDs.<br />Wow!
B004JHYRDQ|4.0|I gave this a four star because it continues Caves of Steel perfectly with an all new problem for the main characters. All the main aspects of the first book are kept the same but this introduces more psychological effects to people and reveals some things left unknown in the first book. I recommend this to anyone who likes sci-fi that isn't unrealistic past the new technologies developed which one must accept to enjoy any sci-fi book.
146500632X|5.0|Bought this for my teenage daughter.  She loves One Direction so I could not miss with this year's xmas present.  I am a great mom again for the moment anyway.  Thanks
B0062NAX1U|5.0|So often thing are miss listed or labeled, but these were right. Its always good to get the right items and on time.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Not worth spending a penny - one of the worst books I ever read. In paper it would have gone straight to the trash in !
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Very good book<br />A must  read for anyone in any situation in life. Adam Brown was  clearly a highly motivated and genuine operator who loved his family.
B007TS6H9O|5.0|This was a xmas gift for my teenage daughter (13).  She was very happy to get it as most of the things i get her are returned so i gave up trying until i saw this movie for purchase.  Thanks
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Its always rewarding to get the thing you ordered and in a timely fashion. What more could you want from life?
B008O037RG|5.0|Not only is the quality of the vinyl top notch the digital download included is crisp and clear.<br />The album is also exceptionally good, I hadn't thought Mumford & Sons would be able to follow up after Sigh No More without losing the magic.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|It was a little scary not as scary as every one says but it was very fun and I beat the game and it was fun once you get 7 notes he comes to write the last note is.  The scariest part is the house with the tv SCARY because HE'S THERE
B00APUQRPC|4.0|It's a cute father daughter movie that has you laughing one second then on the verge of tears the next. It's a great story.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|So often thing are miss listed or labeled, but these were right. Its always good to get the right items and on time.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie, meant to see it on the big screen, didn't get around to it.  Was not disappointed.  All characters were really intense, going to buy it for my collection.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I could not put this book down. It brought my mind to places I didn't know I wanted to go but once I got there it's the only place I wanted to be.
B007THA4FI|5.0|J. K. Rowling made a smooth transition from the Harry Potter series to her adult fiction book, Casual Vacancy. My husband and I took turns reading it aloud on a long camping trip and were thoroughly entertained by the twisting plot, depth of characters, and interweaving of characters' paths. It is a mistake to try and do any comparisons with her previous series. This book needs to stand on its own merit. Initially, the vulgar language was a little puzzling, I think because you can't help being in &#34;Harry Potter mode,&#34; but once you get to know the characters, it is completely in character. Great read and hoping for more.
B005LAII12|5.0|I got the item I wanted in a timely fashion, that's all I ask for.So often thing are miss listed or labeled, but these were right.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The cast in this movie are very talented.  Just the right amount of quirkiness.  The concept of competitive a cappella shows was genius.  I loved this movie.  The music was awesome.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Original  plot focusing on youth in a dystopian future. Meant for young adults, but enjoyed by anyone who enjoys a decent story from the first person narrative.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Good Cd, really enjoy it. Nice variety of music and enjoy that is was easy to download to the computer.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|One of the most Thrilling adventurous books i have ever read a really great book for teenagers and young adults
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I guess it's ok, I have no way of gauging when in fact I'm fulling utilizing Adobe Reader.  I can't make a real review.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Couldn't put it down. Great story and characters.<br />Would have paid for it but it was free when I read it.
0545265355|3.0|The hardcover set packaging is not of the highest quality, but I did not expect it to be, the bindings are also not of the quality of other youth books like Harry Potter, but they should stand up to a number of readings if you so desire. These books are very easy reads, be it the font size, the simple wording, or the relatively simple plot, most readers will be able to make it through the series with relative ease. This review may contain spoilers.<br /><br />The first book in the series, The Hunger Games, is well crafted, It is far and away the best book in the series. It is a story of a dystopian world in which a girl who in an effort to save her little sister is pitted against seemingly horrific odds in a gladiator style battle to the death. The choices she must make help define her humanity. As the book progresses there are mushy moments, which make it clear that this book is primarily aimed at teen girls. I would give it 4/5 stars, because it does not have the universal appeal of many youth books.<br /><br />The second book in the series, Catching Fire, while not as fluid as the second book deals more with the  consequences of defying government in the dystopia that was unveiled in the first book. I felt like this book was more of an effort to extend the success of the first book, and perhaps not truly necessary. This book has some interesting concepts such as a clever arena in which the tributes must fight, but ultimately it fails to feel like more than a sequel. Once again this book delves into relationships and thus loses some appeal for most male readers. I give this book 3/5 stars, as this book brushes over the complex issues that arise in gladiator type battle and still fails to appeal to more than half of the population.<br /><br />The third book, Mockingjay, is in my opinion the worst book in the series. This book focuses on social revolution led by Catniss' actions in the previous books. this book ends melancholically at best and is really depressing.the entire reason for the sacrifice the main protagonist made in the first book is rendered moot, as is the revolution since the power hungry, government is replaced by one with equally sinister means of obtaining power. This book hardly falls into the happily ever after, and leaves the reader frustrated more than satisfied. I give this book 2/5 stars, because the ending makes the entire series feel as though it was all for naught.<br /><br />When averaged my reviews of these books work out to be 3/5. While the series is worth reading, it is not for everyone, and is not light hearted.
B009PEPML4|5.0|Not exactly new material, but they sound far better than their older versions. Wish there were more songs in it though.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|My Pastor says, if you have the Bible on your electronic device, you just may read it.  So true.  I like this Bible because you can program it to have a devotional reading plan.  You also have choices as to which version of the Bible you would like to read.  Additionally, you can hear it read to you.  Awesome.
B0086700CM|5.0|You can buy powerful and new characters with the coins you collect playing, so it pushes you to try. Go farther and you get a bigger challenge. I got up to a million points because of how often I play it. It's free too, so you don't have an excuse for a great game.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey sends the soul to unseen and unimaginable, far-off lands of her own design. She blends traditional, classical violin with contemporary dub & hip-hop inspired flavors, resulting in a musically rich aural landscape. There are many layers of texture to discover. Her style is witty, upbeat; with many hooks to set your feet dancing or just whistling along with her on another melodic romp. If you only buy one disc in 2013, I highly recommend you give Linsdey Stirling a listen. Enjoy!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|All movies in one single box.<br />Extremely high sound and image quality.<br />For cinema lovers and for a good price.<br />A perfect gift.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Super suspenseful. Great acting. Jessica Lange is superb.<br />Having the same cast as season 1, in different  roles/characters  also adds to to the show
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love this game, and I know the trial time is a bit short but a way to keep playing not having to download  again is just click New world after the trial before ends. Do that and its a regular game.
0345529057|5.0|Arrival was even earlier than what expected, which in my case, and supported by great expectations, it was a great surprise.<br />The product arrived in ALMOST perfect conditions, there was, indeed, a little bent in one of the corners. I would strongly suggest the usage of air bags in both sides of the package, not only in one, that would have made a perfect shield.<br /><br />Anyway, I found that I was lack on separators, so I also thought it would be great if you add some. It would also make great publicity!<br /><br />Thanks for this delightful christmas present!
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|5 stars for sure. They took there ability of mixing great vocals with complex melodies and put a theme to this album which makes it AMAZING. They have definielty raised the bar, and this album is a must buy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game to me is like another temple run, it's fun and you can unlock characters and boards to customize your player. I love the animation and I can sit here and play on it all day.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Absolutely love this! It has so many great ideas! Has helped me start planning for my dream wedding I want to have one day
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Best trilogy ever. Beautiful love story. So realistic about how people aren't perfect but still can be Perfect for each other in screwed up ways. It reads so fast and ended too soon!!!
B009POCG0Y|1.0|Wow, this movie sucked. Plain and simple.<br /><br />It has a lot of promise--a cop who's a hitman and the dumb family that hired him to do a job--but that's the high point of the movie: it's potential.<br /><br />It never delivers.<br /><br />But a better writer/director could've done something with the material.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I think it is a great book because it provides help with words when I need to look up something or need help spelling a word or something. So great book!!
B004QX07G4|5.0|This book just reiterates everything I love about her. I know this was meant to be a funny book (and by all means it was!) but the underlying message of being a  positive and thoughtful person is the reason why I read the book in the first place. A very fun and refreshing read!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book only gets more inspiring the more you read it.  I've read it twice now, and each time I find different meaning.  I love the spiritual aspect of this book, and how uniquely it is approached.  Pi's narrative throughout the story is astonishing; Yann Martel has managed to create a thoroughly engaging story with seemingly sparse elements.  The ending is powerful and gut wrenching, but beautiful.  All in all, a lovely story, a visual read, and a beautiful message.  \\"Life is all about endings; the important part is remembering to say goodbye.\\"
6305212112|5.0|Love it and great price too.  Great Christmas Gift for my sister,<br />she loves it too.  Will order more DVD's.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|Simple, neat camera app. A small selection of cool filters. Nice user interface unlike a lot of the other, more fully featured camera apps.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|We watch this every year around Christmas - it has become a family tradition and it was time to buy the DVD.  This movie is always good for a laugh during the holiday season
B0093COK4S|4.0|Sandra's \\"Stay in Touch\\" is an album of new material that revisits her early styles (i.e. \\"The Long Play\\", \\"Mirrors\\",and \\"Into A Secret Land\\"). I think that most Sandra fans will like this album. Although the songs definitely have a \\"likeability factor\\",they are not as strong (in my opinion) as the selections that appeared in her earlier (style) albums. Perhaps this is PARTLY because many of the songs seem to indirectly resemble some of her earlier favorites. (Compare \\"Kings and Queens\\" to \\"Maria Magdalena\\", \\"Between Me & the Moon\\" to \\"Secret Land\\", \\"Sand Heart\\" to Midnight Man\\".)<br /><br />In some ways, I think it was a good idea for Sandra to reach back to her earlier style music, since THOSE albums are the ones that Sandra fans remember playing over and over again. The songs were strong with catchy verses and choruses. The songs on this new album  (\\"Stay in Touch\\") are well produced, arranged brillantly,nice vocals, and are pleasant to listen to. However (in my opinion), once you've heard them, you might not feel overly inspired to keep playing them (over and over) again (as you may have done with Sandra's early albums).<br /><br />I recommend you purchase the Deluxe Edition. The bonus disc containing remixes of each song (in a different and more logical track order) are (in my opinion) more exciting to listen to than the original album disc.<br /><br />In closing, I will say that Sandra's \\"Stay In Touch\\" is a GOOD album and you WILL enjoy listening to it (particularly the second disc of remixes). Whether these songs will hold up and \\"stand the test of time\\" like her early classics remains to be seen.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|love it hands down. being able to have my music anywhere without eating up space on my sd card. also not having to fumble with syncing with the pc is a plus
0756666937|5.0|Great book with tons of information about the company and &#34;the brick&#34;.  I love that they include the name and number of every set they picture throughout the book!
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|has all the shows that I love to listen to like Armin Van Buuren. I bought the premium subscription and I think it was well worth  the cost
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I am pretty impressed with this app.<br /><br />it is by no means a substitute for Microsoft Office,however it gives you enough in the way of editing options to get a pretty great start on just about any project.
B004XZR63M|3.0|It's a good read.  The author clearly has a huge ego. I guess when you've figured out how to be rich, you get to have a big ego right?
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book.  I have let several others read it on my Kindle and they loved it also. Grisham really knows how to weave a story and keep you glued to it until the end.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I love the convenience of shopping from my phone. it definitely makes shopping a little too convenient (if you know what I mean).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is what my daughter in law reported upon starting to watch the series.  This video made a great Christmas gift.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Great for kids and teen's to be their self. Aka the world best game ever and awesome. See you soon enough
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Frank Ocean does an incredible job of mystifying the listener with his word play, you never know what he is going to say or how he is going to say it. If you love music, this is a must have. Melodies, rhythm, soul and dance.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Love the cast, the locale, the story, the quirky family and the memories of what it is like to be young and wanting to be somewhere else other than where you are.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|This got here on time and is great.  I would recommend it to any one.  I would do it again.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|Does a good job of identifying what song you are listening to and also has a few extra features, for example finding the lyrics or even watching the YouTube video of the song.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I would recommend this book to both children and adults. It is a great read. At times, I couldn't put it down. It is filled with parallelism and other literary treats, but doesn't require too much analysis. Made me laugh and cry. I really enjoyed it!
B005NPBT5M|5.0|This is one of the albums that decide whether you have taste and refinement, or you are a poleaxed pimple-faced fool who has fallen into the cesspool of non-talent loving childishness. (yeah, i am talking about the brain dead beiberites and the like). One direction, give me a break. Where has music gone? How can you possibly even begin to compare the magic of  Pink Floyd's lyrics such as Waiting to weed out the weaklings.<br />Waiting to smash in their windows<br />And kick in their doors.<br />Waiting for the final solution<br />To strengthen the strain.<br />Waiting to follow the worms.<br />Waiting to turn on the showers<br />And fire the ovens.<br />Waiting for the queers and the coons<br />and the reds and the Jews.<br />Waiting to follow the worms...<br /><br />with  beepers baby baby oh im like baby baby oh?<br /><br />The wall explores the torment and isolationalism of war, statism and loss of family, faith and identity.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Love the opportunity to read Kindle on my android. Very convenient & easy to use. Basically its the same as having a Kindle. Love it!
B00328G4Y8|4.0|Jimi Hendrix is a wizard. Concocting a musical medley that will tease all the senses. To get the best experience out of this album turn down, relax, wear some big noise-cancelling headphones and get ready to taken for a ride.<br /><br />Spanish Castle Magic, Little Wing, Castles Made of Sand and One Rainy Wish are my favorite songs from this worthy album.<br /><br />TIP: it is nearly impossible to enjoy this with one earphone in, Jimi toys around with the music in motion, moving around the room, coming at you from both sides then only one side for a different aural experience.<br /><br />A necessity in any Rock collection
B000JQU4TW|5.0|This is an old favorite of my mother's. I saw the old movie many years ago, and decided to get the book. It was just as good as I recall the movie as being....or better.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a really great use of tech....Put you right in the mood for meditation Great as a background too, You get to mix up some of the sounds of nature with music, or white noise. Brings a new creativity to meditation.<br />The volume on my Kindle may need ajusting somtimes, may try using headphones with it.<br />Overall....excellent product.....
B002LC8HF0|5.0|It's hard for me to find books that surprise me anymore. Especially by authors I've read quite a bit from. In the end most writers are predictable in the way they portray their writings. To say the conclusion of this book (as sudden as it was) was an unexpected shock is a gross understatement. The series sucked me in from the first book and kept me satisfied until the very end. Bravo Sanderson. I look forward to your future books ( The conclusion of Jordan's series most of all).
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Nice game, leads you along well but still challenging. Very intuitive gameplay and the included hint section guarantees a low frustration level.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|itś been a long time since SOUNDGARDEN's last album DOWN ON THE UPSIDE....Back in the 90's, i always prefer SOUNDGARDEN's HEAVY METAL besides the more popular Nirvana, and even PEARL JAM....well, what can i say....I'm really glad with SOUNDGARDENś comeback, and even better, with a GREAT GREAT collection of new songs!!!!! I really like All the songs on the incredible KING ANIMAL....itś like the old GARDEN with a modern production....Cornell's voice is just AMAZING, and his lyrics are meaninful ans interesting...Kim Thayl is one of the BEST guitar players EVER, and Matt Cameron and Ben Sheperd are great musicians too....BONES OF BIRDS, BEEN AWAY TOO LONG, NON STATE ACTORS, BLOOD ON THE VALLEY FLOOR, TAREE, ATTRICTION and BY CROOKES STEPS are among SOUNDGARDEN's best stuff!!!!!! REALLY GREAT ALBUM!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED if you once in your life liked this INCREDIBLE band called SOUNDGARDEN!!!!!!!! BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I have been wanting to read this series of books for a while. I was very easy to purchase. Very exciting book and I am only on chapter one.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS FANTASTIC, WELL WRITTEN , KEPT.ME UP ALL NIGHT, I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN, A MUST READ FOR ANY SUSPENSE FAN.....
B000001IPP|5.0|LET'S GO is a great great great compilation of catchy fast raw punk hardcore tunes from one of the BEST PUNK ACTS EVER!!!!! man, i put RANCID in the same level of the legendary RAMONES and CLASH as the best fun punk of ALL TIME!!!!! all the songs rules like BLACK AND BLUE, AS ONE, SIDE KICK, GAVE IT AWAY, RADIO, DOPE SICK GIRL, TENDERLOIN.....well, if you like punk rock, i totally recommend LET'S GO!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|out of all the games  you offer this was the first one I picked .l. haven't  had the time  yet
0765325950|5.0|I am writing this review to offset the storm of negative reviews by childish Kindle readers. Reviews are normally meant to rate the book itself, not the myriad of modern formats that small children and ignorant adults seem to think are the only means of dissemination. The publisher made it very clear that they would roll the book out in the fashion they have with so many books before.<br /><br />I am a Kindle owner, yet unlike modern children I grew up reading actual books. Almost every book in the Wheel of Time series came out in hardback first, then paperback, and eBook later. This is normal. In fact, most books in general have followed this formula for hundreds of years. eBooks are new thing, and they are often NOT the first priority of the publishers...who produce BOOKS to make PROFIT.<br /><br />I have had to wait for many books to come out in digital format to read them on my Kindle, or to pony-up and buy the real book. I accept this. It is normal reality.<br /><br />If you are whining about not getting the book in your chosen format, you are an ignorant child.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A gripping story from the first page to the last. I couldn't wait to order the second book!<br />A must read!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Being Cooped Up After Surgery This Game Brought Me Some Enjoyment I Wish Some Things Were Easier To Get But All In All A Lot Of Fun
B00APUQT7I|3.0|Enjoyable, fun but not the best Ice Age film and we are fans of this series.<br />Story line aimed much more at childrean and their relationships with parents.<br />There were several send ups of other films and stories which keeps you on your toes, trying to spot the references.<br />Altogether a good family movie but not the full blown belly laugh, that we've experienced with earlier Ice Age movies.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I adored season one and am so happy to be able to have season two.  Benedict Cumberbatch is an incredible actor; Martin Freeman is adorable; the stories themselves are just amazing.  Definately worth the cost!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Takes the tale of Snow White back to the dark and grim origins of fairy tales.<br />The special effects are very good, it's a visual experience.<br />Pure and simple fantasy with the eternal struggle of good against evil.<br />Not a film for the very young or those who are squimish.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Okay movie but not as good as the first three.  Perhaps the sequel to this one, if it happens will be better and provide better connection to the new character.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|What can you say? It's Joe. The audio is GREAT and to listen to him explain the making of the album gives insight to what real music is and that there are still those care about their craft.
B003K15IF8|4.0|&#34;Stoner&#34; was an engaging book. A tale about love in many forms and the trials each form can have.  In the end, his life could have been much more.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|nice video to help learn how it all happened and I can watch it over to catch what I might have missed
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Good Price for hard to find product. I would recommend this to everyone, Arrived quickly. Reliable Vendor. Good Deal. Good Value
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Each Christmas, my wife and (now grown) two sons watch &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34;.  This version lives up to expectations.  There are very few films (for anyone) that can elicit the same response upon each and every viewing.  For many, this may be the only film that does just that.  We love it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This seemingly crazy heroine is absolutely addictive and this book makes you root for her more than the first one.
0765324857|4.0|Fun read!<br />As a fan of the games I really enjoyed learning how Rapture came to be and what happened to make it fall.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Would recommend this game to anyone into hogs. I loved it . kept you wanting to knowing what was next couldn't put it down.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Wonderful graphics. Didn't want to put it down. Everything wrapped up in a nice package. So Ready for the sequel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a fast and easy read. Sucked me in from page one. Done in two days. Can't wait till the next book.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|Ordered this for my 9-year-old grandaughter.  She and her 6-year-old sister totally enjoy it.  A perfect gift for little girls!
B000AP04OM|3.0|I am so used to receiving &#34;used items&#34; in A 1 condition that I usually choose those,rather than NEW!  I was surprised to find this DVD combination without any explanation &#34;booklet&#34; and without a shrink-wrapped protective cover. I bought it as a gift and am anxiously waiting for a chance to see it and see if it is in A 1 shape!  I will be upset if it is not!
B004G600A4|5.0|This movie should receive a 10 star rating.  What is not to like about the story of Rapunzel.  Gift for grandaughters.  They have watched it over and over and over!  Simply delightful!
B009FBX5M0|4.0|A very competent soundtrack, but, unfortunally, don't includes the beautiful title song by Adele. It' s one of the best recient scrores on the Bond' s saga
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|Idiots rob their corpses from the future so they can live in luxury until sent back into the past to be killed by the person they were when they were younger and not as stupid, except when it doesn't happen even though it already did. After collecting on having killed himself back when he was that kid from Third Rock and Inception, you know, Robin from Dark Knight Rises, Bruce Willis, for no reason, wasn't killed, and goes on a shooting spree, aiming guns at toddlers who might grow up to become Hitler. Everybody in this world is a knuckle-dragging neanderthal shooting gigantic cartoon weapons that may as well have come from the Acme Gag Factory in Toon Town. You could have been watching Brick, or Primer, or 12 Monkeys, or Back to the Future, or Terminator, or Bowling for Columbine, all of which would be more pleasant experiences than this.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Just got a kindle for Christmas and bought this trilogy. Once I started I couldn't put it down, one of the best reads!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It would be perfect if you could hide the chat box.  There are some CRAZY people who post on there!
B000A6T1JU|5.0|Thanks I enjoyed the movie and my library has another classic in it's the inventory. Thanks a million for the memories.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is great, bought one for myself months back, brought this for a Christmas gift, series was cancelled far to soon, highly recommended.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My little girl really wanted to see this movie and my husband thought it looked good so the whole family went to see this one in theatres. Now I really didn't want to go sit through yet another animated movie AT the movies so I dreaded it. The movie was over before I realized it because it was just so good. This is one animated movie that is easy to get lost in because the story is so different from all the other princess stories out there. I loved it and so did the whole family. In fact my youngest daughter has declared her next birthday party to be a \\"Brave\\" party and the whole family is super excited about it. We really, really liked this movie! This is definitely one to buy because you'll want to see it more than once.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is a great book.  Can't wait to finish it.  Easy to read on the Kindle.  The auto bookmark is a great feature.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Loved the characters.  Would love for it to be a series. Great characters and thrilling story..maybe how they grow into adulthood.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the best game I have ever played in my life.  It really is fun. GET THE GAME!!!!!
B000002GKT|5.0|Enough said.Marriot at his rip-roaring best,Frampton before he became irrelevant.Ten more words required?You have got to be kidding.Booga Booga.-booga.One more word?Here!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Luv it! I do agree with the previous poster RE advertising an app free when it's not...at least should say \\"DEMO ONLY\\" or somethin to that effect! That being said, I would have paid for it, just for the picture and description! It actually DOES measure up, which unfortunately is gettin rare anymore. Great creepy graphics, good story, keeps ur interest. Recommended!
B007T99ENE|4.0|Ian McEwan doesn't office have a voice as a female, so this was a nice change.  Pointed, clever prose, as usual.  Very nice twists in the character & interesting time in British mainland history (from the service's point of view, that is).  Worthwhile, indeed.
0765325950|1.0|It is insane that the ebook will be released months from now. I refuse to be bullied into buying a hardback. Get with the game Tor or go extinct.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Very very very very very  Very very very very very very very very very very very very very very good. Not even good but fantastic
0440234743|5.0|I really liked this book.  The author has many good books, but this one is my favorite.  Hard to put down sometimes.
B001202VJU|5.0|Arise is one of my favorite albums from Sepultura and for 5.99 why wouldn't I download it. I have the cd version but after so many years of wear and tear the sound quality deteriorated, so I got a digital copy and the sounds quality is great.
0439023513|5.0|Excellent wrap up to the Hunger Games trilogy.  This book was wildly entertaining and imaginative!  She really has a way of immersing you in the story and putting your right there into the fight.

B006MPK9SU|4.0|A great, fast paced detective story with my favourite detective in action. There are lots of twists and turns and a serious underbelly to this gripping tale.
B00ATPVA78|3.0|I was disappointed with the game.  Lately G5 either puts out great games or games like this which are short and have a bad story line.  This game was not worth the money.  I hate completing a game that I immediately want to delete from my kindle.  G5 you can do better.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The fans of the Percy Jackson series and the new Heroes of Olympus series will not be disappointed with The Mark of Athena. The plot is thrilling from cover to cover, and will have you reading for hours at a time. The new multiple-viewpoints style gives the story even more depth in this book, and paints a clearer picture of what is unfolding. Another masterpiece from Rick Riordan.

Dean Holder is the ideal boyfriend, wish he was real. I could not stop reading, the story has so many twist and turns you just want to know what is going to happen next. Totally recommend it.
0385344333|4.0|Seventeenth in the Jack Reacher suspense series. Reacher is thumbing a ride out of the disaster of [[ASIN:0385344317 Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher, #15)]].<br /><br />My Take<br />It's am improvement over [[ASIN:0553818139 61 Hours (Jack Reacher, #14)]] and [[ASIN:0385344317 Worth Dying For (Jack Reacher, #15)]], and yet it lacks the tension and depth of earlier Child-Reacher installments. It's a bit depressing as well when even Reacher starts referring to himself as \\"old\\". Sigh.<br /><br />This was fun to read as Reacher figures out who these three people are in the car he's hitched a ride in. How he determines what's a lie and what's not. Sorenson could be a match for him in terms of figuring things out, but she is not a match for countering his logic, and she ends up following along. But, then, we knew how that was going to go.<br /><br />Child is certainly tricky in keeping us in suspense as to what happens to the witness, the little girl, Karen...talk about shades of post-9/11 and those overreaching laws that trample all over our rights. The FBI wants to arrest Reacher no matter what.<br /><br />It's certainly a good lesson in not assuming anything, as well as why I never want a corporate/government job!<br /><br />Okay, really odd. Reacher never gets laid in this one. He's sure thinking about it, doing a little feeling around, but...nada, zip, zilch. Poor baby.<br /><br />There are some loose ends: Goodman figures they took Lucy out on foot, but we never learn how that occurred or if he was even right; then there's Lester3 whose identity we never learn; and, just why Washington is so concerned about Kansas City's propensity for killing people off.<br /><br />The Story<br />A dead guy in an abandoned pump house gets the police, FBI, CIA, and the State Department all 'het up with blockades and search parties. Leave it to Reacher to thumb his way right into the middle of it all.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Jack Reacher is bashed and somewhat broken after events in Worth Dying For, and all he wants to do is get to Virginia. An ex-MP, he's huge at 6-foot-5 with \\"hands the size of dinner plates\\". Not necessarily someone you'd feel comfortable picking up on the side of the road.<br /><br />County Sheriff Victor Goodman lives up to his name. He's good, experienced, and smart. So why he appointed Puller as his chief deputy, I'll never know.<br /><br />Special Agent Julia Sorenson is highly qualified, highly experienced, and highly regarded. Until she meets rebel-with-a-cause Jack Reacher. Special Agent-in-Charge Stony Perry is Sorenson's boss and a real jerk, more interested in how he looks than in truth or justice. The following are Special Agents with counterterrorism out of Kansas City: Robert Dawson and Andrew Mitchell come to look over Sorenson's shoulder and Bale and Trapattoni handle the hotel duties. Lester Lester Lester, Jr. is with the State Department. And gots him a real imaginative daddy...!<br /><br />Karen Delfuenso is a cocktail waitress at Missy Smith's, who just wanted to go home to her little girl, Lucy. Paula is the neighbor's little girl and Lucy's friend.<br /><br />Alan King and Don McQueen seem to be partners with Delfuenso. Rather overbearing ones. Peter James King is Alan's younger brother.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is RED with touches of yellow and white. A long, empty, open road disappearing into the distance in Nebraska.<br /><br />The title is true enough as Reacher is A Wanted Man.s in Worth Dying For, and all he wants to do is get to Virginia.

B00AGMTA62|5.0|Having reviewed these New Year Concerts ever since 2000, I'll choose to mention mainly new features this year, rather than repeat the same adulatory comments.<br /><br />Brief items by Wagner and Verdi are included, not only because it is the 200th anniversary of their birth but also because they each had a great admiration for Johannn Strauss Jnr, the waltz king.  Another of his admirers was Franz von Supp&eacute; whose \\"Leichte Kavallerie\\" Overture is also included.  There are also several \\"first timer\\" Strauss Family items.  And watch to see what cuddly toys are handed out to some of the orchestra's leading players during an item by Johann Strauss, the Father.  The waltz king himself conducted his own compositions in this magnificent hall, looking just as dapper by all accounts as this year's conductor Franz Welser-M&ouml;st.  Welser-M&ouml;st even allows the cameras to follow him into the wings when he departs the podium, so we can see what restorative treatments conductors receive between appearances.<br /><br />Ever modest and generous, the waltz king once said, \\"I might be the most popular Strauss brother but Pepi (Josef) was the most talented\\".  Judge for yourself as you hear two of their best waltzes: Josef's \\"Sph&auml;renkl&auml;nge\\" and Johann's lovely \\"Wo die Citronnen bl&uuml;h'n\\".<br /><br />Finally, providing a link to the Strauss Dynasty we see in the audience a great-granddaughter of Josef  Strauss, after the playing of \\"Plappermaulchen\\" (Chatterbox), an item he dedicated to his little daughter Karoline Anna.
B009VB97EY|1.0|This was less than a B movie. The acting was terrible and the characters were in-interesting.  Sounded like it coud be a bit of fun, but I couldn't even waste my time to watch the whole thing.

0812993292|4.0|REVIEWED BY LAURA<br /><br />I was pretty sure that I would like this book the first time I heard about it. The book had several things going for it right away:<br /><br />1) It is set in England. I'm the resident Anglophile, remember?<br />2) The main character's name is Harold, my late, beloved grandfather's name.<br />3) Harold lives in Kingsbridge. Kingsbridge! The very place [[ASIN:045123281X The Pillars of the Earth]] takes place! (Albeit like 1000 years earlier, but still.)<br />4) It involves an ordinary person doing an extraordinary thing and promises interesting characters along the way. Seriously, if someone set out to write a book specifically for me, they would be hard-pressed to do any better.<br /><br />So the real question is: did this book live up to my expectations? Yes, yes it did. The first half or so is very light-hearted and I thoroughly enjoyed traveling with Harold. He meets many interesting people along the way and listens to their stories the way only a polite Englishman can. He discovers the simple act of walking as a way to reconnect with himself and his past. He struggles with blisters and mundane things that someone unused to a life of physical activity would struggle with. And as a reader you are full of questions--what happened to Harold and Maureen's marriage? What exactly is Queenie's connection to Harold?<br /><br />Then, so slowly it's almost imperceptible, the walk starts to take on a more sinister tone. It's not all friendly people, humorous bunion-related stories, and picking up souvenirs at tourist stops. The walk begins to take on more urgency, and Harold seems to be teetering on the edge of sanity. While before we were learning about Harold's past in drips and drabs, all of a sudden the memories come pouring out of him. Queenie's letter was the jolt that he needed to take him out of his humdrum daily life, which was almost like not living at all. When all was said and done, I was entirely unprepared for the effect this book would have on me emotionally.<br /><br />This past year has been full of change for me, and this book is a reminder that we are not prisoners of the past. Harold (by his own admission) is an extremely unremarkable man. He worked in sales at a brewery, has lived in the same house for 45 years, and has had many failures as a husband and father. It would have been easy to make Harold a saint, but we discover that he is just as flawed as the rest of us. Honestly, there were times when his inaction in the past drove me crazy. But one day he decided to do something that would change his life forever. It was that simple. Every day each one of us has the chance to do something remarkable, although it might not seem like it. Maybe it's a small gesture--sending a letter to a long-lost friend, sharing a kind word with someone who is upset, paying for someone's coffee in the drive-through. It seems a bit clich&eacute; to say that this book restored my faith in humanity, but I dare you to read it and come away unchanged. Even if you just hug your loved ones a little closer or are less quick to snap at your husband when he does something that drives you up the wall (hypothetically).<br /><br />All raving aside, I do have a few criticisms. First, a pretty major plot point is deliberately covered up and then when it's revealed it doesn't seem fair because you were being purposefully misled. That is one of my literary pet peeves! Second, there are several times when Harold discusses at length what it is like to be one with the moon and the hedgerows and the wild mushrooms, etc. (a bit too \\"woo woo\\" for me). It also seems a little far-fetched that Harold truly believes that as long as he is walking Queenie will live. I have no doubt that he wants this to be true, and that he believes the pilgrimage is important, but I don't think he can actually believe that he is keeping her alive. There is also an unfortunate part where Harold takes on a group of followers--while I have no doubt that this would totally happen if such a walk were actually undertaken (the media!), it was my least favorite part of the book.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />This book is like [[ASIN:0743453255 Forrest Gump]] meets [[ASIN:1613821166 The Odyssey]] meets [[ASIN:B0036S4CIO Major Pettigrew's Last Stand: A Novel]]. Or like [[ASIN:1480263303 The Canterbury Tales]] meets [[ASIN:006095955X A Walk Across America]] meets [[ASIN:B000SEGMAU Tuesdays with Morrie]]. Is that enough description for you?  I am not a fast reader but I read the last 120 pages straight through (ignoring other things that I should have been doing instead!). Although I did have a few issues (see above), none of them were big enough to interfere with my enjoyment of the book overall. I definitely recommend THE UNLIKELY PILGRIMAGE OF HAROLD FRY and think it would make a great beginning of the year read.<br /><br />RATING: A- (4½ stars)s would totally happen if such a walk were actually undertaken (the media!), it was my least favorite part of the book.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />This book is like [[ASIN:0743453255 Forrest Gump]] meets [[ASIN:1613821166 The Odyssey]] meets [[ASIN:B0036S4CIO Major Pettigrew's Last Stand: A Novel]].

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|The unrated version is great, but probably not for your kids. If you want to laugh and be entertained, this is a nice surprise!
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|A nice heart-warming movie. My kids were trying to imitate Bryony, the elf, at the end - very funny! A movie you can probably watch over and over again, with or without the kids.
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie. It was thoroughly entertaining. The acting was well one. It had great humor. I especially enjoyed the humor in the cemetery.
B00466HN72|3.0|This movie is ok. My daughter loves bunnies so that is why we got it for her, but I think overall it is average.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book is a great easy read. Well written. It has a great story line that feels very real-great fiction.
B0038M2RL2|5.0|One of my childhood movies. Great fighting scenes.  The locations the movie is shot are incredible and set the tone for the movie perfectly!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I'd heard good things about Pitch Perfect so I rented it to watch with my mom.  We both agreed it was a little disappointing, but was cute in the end.  It wasn't a waste of time, but had I known, I might have chosen to watch something else.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I have read every book about Detective Pendergast and this one did not disappoint. It's a continuation of his last book, &#34;Fever Dream&#34; and was just as good if not better. No spoilers here. I will just say it answered questions and surprised me.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I downloaded this app for my nieces and nephew to play on my Kindle as I already had it on my phone (I actually wanted my phone back, hehe).  They love it, and are enthralled at the graphics.  Great job
B005ERYEGU|4.0|Relatively short and an easy read. Has good content without all of the excessive filler and author gloat stories found in other self-help books. The author discusses some good, actionable ideas and concepts. I would recommend.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I like how exuberant Ferriss is in this book, although this is the first book I have read by him. I took advantage of a limited time half off sale price on the ebook and downloaded it to my iPad. I'm glad I did, I like being able to zoom in on the photos and click on videos to watch them directly. He has a lot of interesting points and I'm excited to implement them into my workflow, and cooking flow :) I recommend it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Definitely spoke to the heart and had amazing twists. Worth the money you won't regret it. Makes you wish you had their connection.
B0099114WO|3.0|Gave it to my wife for a christmas gift we watched it and was not thrilled about the movie at all.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Let me start off by saying how good-looking this (small) device is. Anyhow, depending on your particular situation, this may or may not be your best choice. There are alternatives out there that one could possibly find for less money, but many alternatives are around this price range, or higher.<br /><br />If you know enough to know that you needed this adapter in the first place, then you probably don't need to know much more. Super easy to connect, set-up, and start using it! Simple, simple, simple! And it just looks so darn nice!<br /><br />Another great, well-functioning, straight-forward product made by the folks at Anker!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I almost rated 4 stars because of how scary this game was a must buy. he moves WAY to fast once I was in the house saw him over the hills figured I had some time so I got the page and turned around and he was right there but overall this is an amazing game
B003EVWDR0|2.0|Cameron did a great job of portraying his vision of an alien world, but the story quickly becomes predictable in a particularly unsatisfying way.  I won't spoil the ending here, but I should note that the movie seems intended as a vehicle for heaping scorn on capitalism and the military.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Highly recommend this book to anyone. Couldn't put it down, read it in less than two days.<br />  Was not what I was expecting but highly surprised,  loved it to the end.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|It is easier to wait until on dvd, otherwise the suspense is too much. This years story is great as well.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am a huge fan of the first book and and just finished this one and I love it.. stop much!!!!
B005MJ883K|4.0|The game itself was entertaining and a hit. The &#34;Value Added&#34; black bag for storage was a complete waste. The game does not even fit in the bag.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Five stars for being one of the best books I've read in a while.Ernest Clines stirring style is simple and easy to read and very descriptive without rambling. The only thing is I found a few parts to be a bit far fetched. Other than that this book is amazing.
B004H6P2O2|5.0|Symphonies 1 - 7; Violin Concerto*; Finlandia; The Swan of Tuonela; Karelia Suite; En Saga; Serenade in G Minor*; Valse triste.<br />Julian Rachlin, Violin*; Pittsburgh Symphony; Lorin Maazel, Conductor.<br /><br />Lorin Maazel's Decca cycle of the Sibelius Symphonies with the Vienna Philharmonic has always been a top recommendation in these works. That fact seems to have worked against Maazel's digital remakes in Pittsburgh, because - the feeling goes - Pittsburgh ain't Vienna, Sony ain't Decca and conductors usually miss the boat when they remake their earlier Sibelius recordings (Colin Davis, Bernstein, Barbirolli, Berglund). That doesn't hold true for Maazel's second complete cycle on Sony, recordings which to my ears are even finer as interpretations and which are truly remarkable in their recorded sound (which is absolutely state-of-the-art, and which - quite frankly - put the sound of the Decca recordings in perspective: they're great for 1960s sound, but these digital recordings are even greater).<br /><br />The Sony sound on these discs is remarkable, finely detailed and overwhelming when the dynamic rises to a high level. There's no sonic mush here - everything is clear and natural. I very much like the sound of the wind instruments in these recordings - this is great playing by any measure. The strings are also quite warm and wealthy. Brass are flawless, with a wide palette of color that one doesn't often hear.<br /><br />Significantly, these recordings have not been mastered to accommodate casual listening. By that, I mean that the dynamic range is very wide. The pianos are very piano and the fortes are very forte. One needs to approach listening to these recordings as if one is sitting in a concert hall, isolated from the noises of the world and able to concentrate on the music. A good example of this is the recording of the First Symphony, where the oft-quiet passages are really played quietly. They can easily go missing if one is listening casually. But listen as if at a concert, and the rewards are palpable.<br /><br />The Fourth and Fifth Symphonies in this set are top recommendations, with realistic and impressive sound and strongly characterized performances. The surges in sound at the climax of the Fifth need to be heard to be believed - there is no \\"cap\\" on what comes off as an always-growing tension and volume.<br /><br />In addition to the symphonies, this set includes a number of well-known concert pieces, as well as a spectacular recording of the Violin Concerto played by the youthful Julian Rachlin. This set is worth acquiring for Rachlin's Concerto recording alone.<br /><br />The price on this set is very competitive, especially for a digital set recorded on a major label.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ut listen as if at a concert, and the rewards are palpable.<br /><br />The Fourth and Fifth Symphonies in this set are top recommendations, with realistic and impressive sound and strongly characterized performances.

0765325950|1.0|Why would you punish E-Readers by releasing the digital version 3 months after the hardcover? They want to make as much money as possible, while holding onto old fashioned ideas of distribution.  Release the digital version at the same time at the same price as the hardcover -- plenty of people will pay the same price for the digital version.  If you're not going to release the digital version at the same time as the hardcover, don't be surprised people won't want to pay full price.
B005DI9906|5.0|Four Feathers is a classic movie.  Very well done in black & white.  I first saw it on TCM  Turner Classic Movies, decided right then I needed to have it in my library, and was very happy to find it on Amazon. Tells a moving story about a person's determination & perseverance in difficult and trying circumstances, to put it mildly.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book, better than the movie.<br /><br />Cannot wait to begin reading the other books in the series. Definitely worth reading.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|One huge feature is the ability to open password protected files in Google Drive. Any one that needs to protect files, but still have them in the cloud will like this suite! Files open faster as well.

1419705849|5.0|For wimpy kid fans it keeps up with the basics but not quite as funny as the others. Still a good addition.

B000FCKIFU|4.0|This book is full of suspense and action.  A good spy thriller.  The authpr uses the same characters in other books.
0307730697|5.0|good book for any service member or anyone interested in current events. great story. support our troops and God Bless!
0060935464|5.0|This is the best classics book I've read so far (though I've only read a few).  It truly lives up to all the hype.  So if you haven't read it yet, treat yourself to a wonderful reading experience and be sure to get your hands on this gem!<br /><br />This story provided an awakening to some people's impudent thinking.  That in mind, I demanded and cried for simple human decency and glad that this book delivered.<br /><br />Incredible cast of characters, thought provoking, and illustrated a nostalgia for nobility.  Definitely my kind of book!  I'm one happy reader.  :D
0439023521|5.0|the first book of this series is by far my favorite! but the whole series is amazing! read this series now!
044654759X|3.0|(Reviewed 3/28/11)<br />This was J. Lo's \\"Enough\\" meets Bruce Willis's \\"The Sixth Sense\\".  A weird combination but the suspense factor (last 80 pages or so) got you through it.  At that point I wanted the ending to be a happy one or I'd go nuts!!  Let's just say that the ending involved saving the taxpayers some money.<br /><br />Stories involving battered women is a hard topic for me.  It ruffles my feathers!  So this was a book that I had to read slowly.  That said, I felt for Erin (aka Katie).  I loathed Kevin, the abusive husband.  I cheered Erin's courage to escape Kevin.  I was glad Katie met Alex and the kids.  I was happy that there was an end to the nightmare.  Everything in between was unrefined but the account of a woman making it through such a horrendous ordeal was a defining moment.<br /><br />It breaks my heart to know that women go through such torment.  It breaks my heart ...
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I think it was almost comical on some of the gore in there but that's not a deal breaker.  Chuck Norris was Hilarious!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Way better than the movie could have ever been.  I was so lost in this book for a week straight, it was all I could think about, and I'm and advocate gamer, I have scores to keep!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Kowabunga!  I've only had a couple of 99 cent special books from Amazon that I thought were outstanding from the start.  One was \\"Wool\\" by Hugh Howey.  And \\"The Martian\\" by Andy Weir.<br /><br />This is a wonderful \\"near-period\\" SF novel on the order of Greg Bear.  It held my attention throughout.  The science was terrific (although I never checked the math), the plot was straightforward but rich in twists and turns.<br /><br />Great job!<br /><br />I'll be looking for more from Andy Weir.
B000000OSE|5.0|Use your Illusion 1 and 2 is truly the last great album from GNR. Some of their greatest songs are contained on vol and 2. If you are a GNR fan this album is not to be missed. Hop on the GNR train for the last great ride of the band!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book, keeps ya guessing. I could not believe all the twists and turns this book took.  Good book went quick
B000000OQF|5.0|Not sure if you really need another review for this classic GNR album. Appetite for Destruction is the crown jewel of the GNR catalog. It just does not get any better than this! This has many of the classic songs and this album is one of the best albums from the 1980's. If you have not heard this one you are really missing out. Add it to your collection now.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this CD of Norah Jones. It is so soulful and her voice is just beautiful and haunting. I listen to it all the time.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|This is a great place to start your collection! It has all the hits just like you would expect. Truly all of the commercial classics are here! If you are looking for an affordable set that contains their hits this is a good place to start!
B006CBSE86|4.0|Better throughout than Dark Passion Play. Nightwish seems to be effectively adapting their style to Anette, which is hilarious because she is no longer with them. Nonetheless this is a pretty good album for fans of Nightwish (maybe not for fans of Tarja).
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Cold fact is a true gem. One of the great lost albums of the late 60.s early 70's. It was completely overlooked here in the US when it first came out. It went nowhere and no one ever heard till decades later! But in South Africa it took off like a silver bullet upon it's release and became one of the classic albums to be released there. From beginning to end this album is filled with powerful moving tracks. Rodriguez is a Latin Bob Dylan with a Motown soul vibe thrown in for good measure! Try it you will like it!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|A fun little game to play when I am bored. I wish it was one where I didn't have to log into a social network to advance later on in the game.
B003Y5H5HO|1.0|Well, I went and saw this at the movies with my daughter-in-law. Silly me. I was so mortified with the close up rape and sex scenes throughout this movie. I had no idea it would get this bad. We couldn't even make eye contact and at parts I didn't even look at the screen, lest somebody might think me a pervert for watching a young woman get raped . Had I been alone I would have left the theater!!!  I won't bother watching the rest of the series when it hits the big screen.<br />Sadly, the story gets kind of lost between the sheets. Normally I enjoy a good creepy thriller like 'Seven' with Brad Pitt or 'Texas Killing Fields' with Sam Worthington but this was too much for me. Should have been X rated!
B006LSZECO|3.0|While I'm not a Pollyanna, I found this story of a man-child and a manipulator really sad.  I kept waiting for something redemptive but, once I finished it, I wondered why I wasted my time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good book, finished it in a day! I am looking forward to the final book in the series. Love the twists at the end
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I ordered this DVD set as a Christmas gift for my daughter who is stationed overseas at a USAF base. Delivery was quick as always and packaged well. My daughter was thrilled with her gift and started immediately watching the first disc on Christmas Eve. Thank You Amazon for making Christmas shopping a little easier.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I don't think the book is funny. In fact, I find it a bit vulgar. I would not recommend it.
B00005ONMP|5.0|I can't turn down a bargain when it's for good music. I also got a Pink Floyd album that is great. I am very happy with this CD.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|I've enjoyed the previous Christian Bale movies, but this one had a darker quality that was great for recapping the series.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Good Heartwarming and _______. The ambiance overwhelmed me to the point I had to quit watching and go relieve myself.
B007EE564U|5.0|Once again, another must read from Vince Flynn.  I just love this writer and his ability to totally engage you.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook android apps need to be improved. This is true for Kindle as well as my phone App. Need to function more like the IE explorer appllication for laptops.
B002U3CCKQ|3.0|This is a very good read.  The plot was tight, characters believable and the story well paced.  I rated it 3 stars because it doesn't make my list of top 100 books and I didn't find it difficult to put down until I was 2/3 of the way through. It is a book to read on holiday whilst wiling away the time.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This game takes a bit of patience, but it is really fun to sit and play alone or with the family. A good challenge and exercise in strategy.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Played for a few seconds and fell in love with the easy controls. Just like other people, it's the arcade all over again. The purchase will not disappoint.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was one of the best I've ever read which took me a whole 2 days to do so. I got so emotionally invested in the characters that my heart almost literally broke for the both of them. I would recommend this book to anyone that reads like I do. I fell in love with it just as anyone who reads it will!!!
B006G2124E|5.0|Very well put together story line. Reflects a time in our country that most of us would just as soon forget.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Twitter is the BEST social media outlet, when you are on the go--an in a hurry. Great for letting friends/family and followers know what you are doing, where you are going, where you will be and how to interact.<br /><br />Further, it lets you easily reach out to a group of people in an instant and keep them informed. Twitter even keeps you informed. It is a great app.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Fast paced and intense.  A great read.  What if you could change history?  Would you try?  Think about it.  Well done, Mr. King.
B0015DYIH2|2.0|Where's the payoff? I'll tell you: It doesn't exist. For three books, I followed and even bought into the relationship between Bella and Edward. All the heavy petting, French kissing, and whispers of you're the one filled the pages to the point of seeping out of its edges, and yet I continued to read, because I believed there was a prize at the end of the rainbow. A prize worth consuming four books, countless hours, and pouring over nearly 2500 pages worth of teenage angst. And what happened? Nothing. There was a buildup to \\"the moment\\" about as large as a tidal wave ready to take out Charleston, SC, but when the moment was finally upon the two young lovers, the door slammed so hard in my face that it rattled the walls. And then there were more \\"moments\\" and on each occasion, the door slammed so hard that the foundation nearly cracked in half. Sure, Stephenie Meyer described the sex that took place after the fact, but I felt like I was on the outer edges of the horizon waiting to break through the atmosphere.<br /><br />After the first lack of production, I nearly tossed my Android out my window. And the other scenes, or lack thereof, only led to more disheartenment. Was I a bit overzealous? Possibly a bit too overeager? Probably. But I bring you back to that number again: 2500. Did Stephenie Meyer need to go into pornographic detail? Absolutely not. But if this was a relationship that changed both Bella and Edward and their entire families, and a relationship worth confronting the Volturi over, then I wanted more than a bit of French kissing, longing glances, and heavy petting: I wanted a peek inside the walls of the bedroom. In fact, I feel like I deserved more, so BREAKING DAWN ended up being one giant letdown for me. I'd even go so far to say it was the mother of all letdowns.<br /><br />But what scares me even more than that is that this is a book (and a series) marketed toward teenagers. What kind of a message does it send when your baby eats you from the inside out? What kind of a message does it send when Bella was meant to be a vampire? She literally transforms from an awkward, uncoordinated teenager to a perfect vampire with grace, precision, and poise in a matter of days, completely capable of controlling her thoughts and thirst. Every other vampire and every other vampire series places much more emphasis on the control factor (control of thirst and desires), and that it is never really under the vampire's complete control, and yet here we are with Bella, the perfect vampire. It's almost laughable in its utter simplicity.<br /><br />But yet why did I have such a hard time buying it? People and society aren't perfect, so this whole concept seems a little too perfect for me. What message does this really send? That if you just become a vampire you can have it all: you can walk out in the sunlight (as long as it's cloudy outside), you can have the perfect daughter, you can be more graceful and controlled than you ever thought possible, and you can have gifts that you couldn't have in human form. Let's sign up right now because I want in on this crap.<br /><br />I mean, it's gotta be better than the imperfect life that I'm leading right now. As for all those teenage readers that have consumed this series, let's face it, being a teenager is a rather imperfect life. All those awkward moments, awkward situations, and that never-ending series of first times, these four novels say let's skip right to being a vampire, because that's where the promise land is baby. And that's one promise I'm not really buying into.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigatorde out?

B005LAIIRQ|2.0|In The Grey, Liam Neeson plays the lead character based in the harsh, cold area of Alaska. It depicts men against beasts, men against the elements, and I guess men against themselves. The story begins slowly showing the lead character torn and hurting, but I have yet to understand why the lead character felt this way or was trying to kill himself. The story moves on to where the lead characters and the other men he works with are in a plane crash. They all eventually succumb to death by the wolves that is tracking them, the severe cold, or the environment. The lead character that Mr. Neeson plays eventually outlasts everyone, and he faces the alpha male of the wolf pack at the end. Then the movie cut to the scene with his wife again, a saline drip, and I don't know what that all meant. I guess she was died?<br /><br />For me, the story was disconnected. If the filmmakers were trying to make a point, I totally missed it. I will say that Mr. Neeson is an excellent actor, and he is the only reason why I watched the entire thing. I thought his character was very intelligent and no nonsense. He tells it like it is throughout the film, and I liked that about his character.<br /><br />But overall, I didn't like the movie. I felt like it wasn't finished. It didn't put everything together for me, and that's what I expected. Well, maybe it was, and I missed it. Anyway, enjoy if you watch.<br /><br />Thanks.
B007OWG3LM|5.0|Received in perfect condition, couldn't have asked for better.  Bought it for my friend as a Xmas present and she absolutely loved it!
B007SGM084|4.0|Enjoyed the book very much. A  Good story. Not as. Much sex as I. Thought their would be. Good  reading

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is nice and easy to use. Its nice to have app right on my kindle, I no longer have to get up and find a calculater, Its right on my reader...Yeah
B00AAX68HG|5.0|The game is very addictive! I enjoyed it so much I put it on all my kid's tablets and they can't seem to get enough of it either. They giggle every time they play the game.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I am glad this is online for me to be able to use my kindle, I like all the info im able to use from this app
B0044XV684|4.0|Liked the book a lot but WHERE IS THE BUTTERBEER?A Harry Potter celebration Isn't worth it unless you have BUTTERBEER.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is so nice to have at fingertips. For us online shoppers who do not want to shop during holidays...
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|XD cards are getting difficult to find in brick and mortar stores - I tried both BJ's and Best Buy with no luck.  I realize that SD cards are the standard now but I have an older FUJI camera that still works great and I like to keep it in my car for emergencies so I wanted to have a few extra XD cards around in case they eventually become unavailable.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app everyday, Its very accurate, I have weather at my finger tips, Its easy to use as well
B004DM0UII|5.0|Well designed app. I like the interface. it wasn't clunky and/or confusing.  I wish it would display the correct artist, but I think all players sometimes have a lag.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I like mystery games, and hidden objects. I think this is one of my favorite games. I will replay it again
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this final book of the Hunger Games series.  I couldn't decide if I  wanted Katniss to end up with Peeta or Gale.  I liked them both.  But I like how it ended.  However I wish there was another book to follow the characters.  Will miss reading about them.
B00563M11M|5.0|All the books by Terry Pratchett are linked but in theory do not need to be read in order.....yet it helps. In order you can observe the characters building in strength. What I like most of these books are the platitudes put across. These one liners of how to live ones life in a sensible fair moral way. Equality to all sentient beings what ever their shape or way of expressions as long as we all attempt to live together peacefully.<br /><br />In this book you see the happily married Sam going on vacation.....yeah, right, ha ha ha. You can take the copper out of the city, but you can't take the copper out of the person.....read on!
B008476HBM|3.0|Seeing Lizzie struggle with herself and others was well done. Mr. Darcy seemed too cruel to suddenly be so nice. But he was trying to NOT love Lizzie. Fun story, everything tied up in a pretty ribbon in the end.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a series told for centuries to come, well written and engaging and filled with life, a must read.
0765325950|5.0|Sanderson is a fine writer and this book is now added to my full set of hardbacks. Thanks. I think I will reread the set again to complete the complex set of plots...
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Always a perrenial favorite, watching the Blu-ray edition makes you feel so much more a part of the story.  The clarity is amazing... you won't be disappointed in acquiring this release!
B005S9EK1S|5.0|The poor rating for this movie on Rotten Tomatoes lowered my expectations of it, but I really enjoyed the film. It was a typical Nicholas Sparks romance novel made into movie. Don't expect a heady film with unpredictable twists and turns, but I enjoyed Zac Efron as the quiet, stoic former Marine who travels across the country to meet the woman whose picture helped save his life in during tours of duty in Afghanistan. The mean ex-husband was a bit over the top, but overall I enjoyed the film and thought Blythe Danner was a scene stealer in this movie.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Interesting concept but fell short.  Too much off color humor which then distracted from the story - not sure there was a plot.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like playing these types of game's fun make more .I love passing the time in the old frontier wild west style
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Told a more believable story and was entertaining.  A bit rushed at the end of the movie in effort to close.
0765325950|1.0|No Ebook was a stupid and greedy move. Tor deserves to have the book's rating go down based on their greed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Five stars for me because I loved the way the story played out,  with laugh out loud moments to painfully sad ones,it's a story that's not always easy to read but I would recommend it to my friends, it's a subject that's hard for me to read about, I just love this book!!
030758836X|4.0|I read this book with great anticipation for all the hype. I loved the style of back and forth narrators and I thought the short-ish chapters were good for busy people who love a good read. The story was meticulous, but I really, really felt uncomfortable with the ending. That said, just waiting to see what happens at the end made this the kind of books you can't put down, kind of a crescendo. It's definitely an engaging read and the characters are so honest (eventually) and real that you can see yourself, even your most unattractive qualities, in them. For that alone I thought this book was very good. I would recommend it. Just make sure you have another book ready to go when you're done with this one so you can forget the ending!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I felt the book started a little slow and repetitive of the first book. The book became a lot better after reading about 40% and then I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to the third book to see what happens with John Breed and Abraham.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|A very good book on who I somewhat have realized is our greatest President in history. The greatest because his honesty, his humility and because his insistence that the best is done for humankind regardless of how his decisions reflected on his popularity. He is the most amazing individual I've ever read about.
B007UQRW62|5.0|Loved the quality of video.. Really enjoyed learning all the facts of production of movie from the  commemorative book.. Still a favorite flick... Makes me smile every time I watch it... Highly recommended
B00280LYHS|5.0|this book has lots of action like the tition curse and is a the next book in the series so it is a good book also. It just follows the other 4 books. They are good.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The setting (Downton and surrounding area) is appealing and the time period fascinating, but the characters make this show. Maggie Smith never disappoints.
B00021HBGS|5.0|These bath stickers are the best,  my girls take a bath together everynight and they love playing with these.  My 2 year old is always putting the tracks together and making the bus or train over it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I loved this movie!!  It is such a sweet movie, I love the girls and the little minions!! What a great movie!!
0307594165|4.0|Not like your usual Toni Morrison read; however, I still enjoyed it, wish she had included more of mystical and para-normal.  The first of her works that I only had to read once to understand.
B0001VV1GK|4.0|Gave this to my 19 month old for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. And I love the all wood construction. The cars and other vehicles from this company are also great. Simple design, lightweight, and little rubber wheels that roll very smooth. I plan on buying more from this company to add on to the garage. My only complaint is that the ramps continue to fall off as they don't attach, they simply rest on the surface. Although, in another review, a customer indicated that he glued the ramps down, which seems like a simple enough fix. Great toy, highly recommend.
020530902X|4.0|Elements of Style is readable, short, amusing, and useful. It was a gift to my college freshman son. I'm betting if he starts editing his papers with Elements of Style in mind his grades will go up. It's a small wager with big potential return.
B0050PYNP8|1.0|just a dumb movie. Some people may like this kind of humor. I personally do not. the plot was bad and the one liners were worse.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great apps for kids and parents I love to play this game it is fun,exciting, and free everything a kid wants. Temple Run is fun but this game has more characters boost and even jetpacks and hoverboards. you can jump on and off trains to get speacial things like a mystery box.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|my granddaughter absolutely loves her sir prance a lot. the quality of this item was wonderful. I would recommend this purchase
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Many books you read will have an ending that leaves you with a finite and unquestionable list of answers and resolutions. This series effortlessly gives you all the answers in a logical, heartbreaking sequence. Gripping with turns and a captivating list of well thought out characters, the end itself leaves you feeling satisfied with the story. It emanates just the right amount of reality to loose none of the experience and keep the tale alive even after you have finished. Suzanne Collins created a story that is horrifically real to people weighted by understanding of the flaws and tendencies that separate US from animals, and in even more ways shows us why we are exactly alike.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a fun way to keep your hands busy if you're like me and can't just sit still while watching tv or something. It's also nice that the games only take a few seconds so you aren't making a big time commitment to play it. Easy download, with fun and simple play.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|This last movie in the series felt like a repeat of everything we've seen, just not doen as well. It essentially told a 10 minute story  in the length of a full movie. I only left it on to see if Alice would end up doing something unique or to discover a new plot twist.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Love Nicholas Sparks books. This takes you into the world of domestic violence and survival. Notebook is still my favorite
B007J4T2G8|5.0|AMAZING BOOK...haven't been this drawn to a book for a very long time. Sucks you right in and keeps you!
B005CRQ2IU|4.0|This story was GREAT and I loved it but I have a LOT of younger siblings and I don't really want them to see silk spectres boobs<br /> or Dr Manhattan's junk.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a very good book and it really makes you want the last one! And i think the movie's gonna be awesome!!
B00AWMCDMY|2.0|Why do the writers keep making Sheldon seem so much nastier than he used to be? He was always a sweet, if not clueless, guy back in episodes like when he was surprised to discover Amy was sexually aroused by Penny's old boyfriend Zack. I hate to see the jokes all be at the expense of female characters who the writers continue to stereotype. It's bad enough Amy and Bernadette can no longer be portrayed as smart and Penny as \\"only\\" being a waitress and Leonard's girlfriend. Those women are just as hilarious as the guys! Their characters deserve funny lines that aren't reduced to crap about their ovaries!<br /><br />Please don't turn this show into Two & a Half Men and Modern Family's trite misogynist one-liners.  Please ... I love this show!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun to play.  Somewhat addictive at first.  Lots and lots of puzzles with various levels for more and more challenge.<br /><br />Though there are different levels, they are all the same.  Similar to say Sudoku.  Many different combinations, but essentially the same thing over and over.  Not necessarily bad, just sayin.  Play a few, do something else for a while, then come back later.<br /><br />As someone w/ some colorblindness, the more difficult puzzles (really large tablet ones in particular) get difficult to see the differences in the colors of the dots.  Some numbers or letters to identify the pairs would be helpful.
0553381407|5.0|This book is a good one to read if you're looking for reasons some peole do what they do. Most of the advice is common sense, and is should be stressed that every person may not have all of the symptoms.
B005IQZB14|5.0|A riveting read that is not only enjoyable for its content, but it is also well crafted!  I devoured it in 48 hours and finished it feeling inspired.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Some slow parts but overall a very entertaining book! Can't wait for the movie! It will probably ruin it though
B0056AFBB2|1.0|When I bought this case I was impressed by the finishing touches. Lots of room, lots of fan mounts. Nice and roomy inside, good cable management.<br />I however bought it for a NAS and wanted 8 HDDs. I started mounting them, and they were a bit cramped. I could not add the last drive. When I took them all out, the screws that have the vibration mounts had scratched all the tops of my drives and ripped the drive labels.<br /><br />Not sure how a case could be made with 8 HDDs slots and only take half height drives.
0345528581|5.0|I will be using the routines with my sons and myself.  I look forward to the great results.  Thank you
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Cd and movie are both awesome!!! I would suggest this for anybody who loves musicals or great music in general!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is very solid. Dont like the scales that came on it, so i made new ones. Still gets 5 stars though cause i like making stuff.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I loved the concept. It's interesting to talk about with friends since we would all have differing opinions. Definitely worth watching. Makes you think.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|After reading the book, I wanted to watch the movie to see just how close the producer could go and include enough to get the author's point across.  Excellent book; great movie.
B004YRSBTW|1.0|This movie was boring strange and we were unable to follow it. Did not watch it. Would not recommend viewing
B00846TRHY|5.0|This is a GREAT movie.  You will just have to watch it to make your own decision regarding the concepts discussed.
B009FOBZL0|4.0|Never bought their first album, but did buy the second (had their big hits - one headlight being one).  Just hadn't found another album they released that I liked as well.  This one is close and good album to listen to multiple times.
B009YU62H2|4.0|All I had to do was just listen to the first song on this album and I was hooked.  Listen for yourself.
B0099G3I96|4.0|Bought their first big hit album, but hadn't gotten anything else from them.  Listened to this on rdio and liked it.  My wife liked parts of it as well, so when it was offered at a sale price, just couldn't resist getting it.  Am glad I did, as I have listened to it multiple times since buying it and still enjoy.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I needed a Kindle cable that I could use while I was using my Kindle.  The one that comes with the Kindle is too short.  This size if perfect.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Then it just got ridiculous and made me mad! I raved to family members and told them to read it....I wasn't finished reading it myself. Once I did finish, I called and told them not to read.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|My 8-year-old granddaughter had no problem learning this game without my help when I was called to the phone a few minutes after launching this new game for her. When I returned from my phone call I was startled when she showed me that with just a couple of taps she could order $99.99 worth of peanuts (real dollars, digital peanuts). I've gotten used to seeing games that constantly entice you to spend 99 cents or $1.99, but $99.99 is a bit beyond belief. Fortunately I have parental controls set to require a password to protect myself from making unintended purchases. It is even more important when grandchildren are around.  She has implored me not to delete the game because of all the progress she has made. The graphics are very nice on the big KFHD8.9 screen.
0393327345|5.0|My Granddaughter needed it for college. She is very please with it. At home she was still reading it... she loves it!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|it a good game for those who want to keep the mind sharp and it help to keep the mind alert
B009O2XY12|1.0|it does not work on my kindle fire. very frustrating. it works on my second divice but not mine! I have uninstalled and reinstalled many many times
B009K45Y62|5.0|My Niece asked me for this limited edition with the Bat Cowl.<br />I won't comment on the movie itself but on the package which was very nice.<br />A solid five star.
B009JBZH54|5.0|GREAT this was a great box set was one of the best box sets for the price I've bought recently.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Fun game challenging but not so hard that you get frustrated. Sometimes hard to navigate as there are lots of screens to maneuver through.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I have always liked this game from the time it came out in my first electronic game and will continue to like it.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Classic holiday story and easy read. Helps to put the holiday in perspective. If you've seen the movies you can imagine the voices while reading.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Grandson of seven years old really loves playing this game.  He does better than I do but I keep trying.
0007447868|4.0|It took me a while to work up the courage to read this book, after reading the poor reviews by other readers. I wasn't disappointed though. I'm not much into the Iron Islands side of the story and I wanted to put the book down while Aeron Damphair was prattling on, but the rest of the story was an enjoyable read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Play this game all the time and will continue to play either on my Kindle Fire or computer.  Great game
B000FA5SMK|3.0|I had already red The Lion and The Panther, and they were better written.  It was good to see how the character came about.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down! It kept me turning page after page! The suspense was killing me! GREAT!
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Enjoyed reading this for the first time- I am 48 and not a big reader.  The language of the time it was written in made it a little difficult and Dickens is wordy for sure, but I am glad I read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addicting I can't stop playing this game I love the graphics on the kindle fire HD.
B004SBQAN8|3.0|The movie followed the book to a certain extent but as with all movies they thought they could improve the original and failed. If I had not read the books I would have given the movie a higher rating but because I did I am going with 3 stars; Hollywood needs to learn to leave the books as is when filming if possible and in this case it was.
1451624468|5.0|This is an amazing story. It is one that every educated person should read and thoughtfully consider. It is wonderful and inspiring that man has been able to ask and now answer such a fundamental question.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it!!!  Better than the first book. About to read the third book. This book keeps you on your feet.
B004U8ZH8S|4.0|We chose this movie for our visiting granddaughter. We all enjoyed the movie & would recommend it to be seen in a family setting.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|This is one of Wes Anderson's best films - it's a sweet, innocent fairy tale of a movie.  The stuff with the scouts is great and both lead child actors are amazing.  If you've had a hard time swallowing Wes Anderson's style, then this movie could be the one to make you a fan.
B004H1V5RU|2.0|The Perplexus Epic looks wonderful in its packaging, and I had high hopes for it being an unusual and fascinating Xmas Present for my 8 year old grandson. However, within the first 10 minutes of playing, the steel ball became jammed in the space beside the start and the present instantly became a headache. The advice on Youtube about jimmying open the sphere and reclamping it is also off-putting -- certainly not what I'd hoped for on Xmas Day!
B003PBB4ME|2.0|In a nutshell - it works with small camcorders like my Canon HFS10 - but barely.  There is a fair amount of flex, so I have to be careful with my moves or it will resonate and my video will make you \\"lose your cookies\\" due to shaking.<br /><br />But I purchased it for my Nikon D800 DSLR and it is completely useless for that.  All you get is bouncy video.  It simply is not rigid enough for a camera of that weight.<br /><br />With something like a GoPro, it should be fine.  Just OK with a compact camcorder.  Fails with anything larger.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Best book I've read in a while. So beautifully written and such a heartfelt story. Wow! Holder started as a typical sexy bad boy but quickly became so much more and Sky was just an amazing character. How she dealt with everything was so real. Not for once did I question anything she did or felt like slapping her for being stupid. Which is an accomplishment in itself. :) Ok, that \\"I live you\\" was a little awkward and I wasn't buying all that lack of technology knowledge thing. I mean, it's not like she was living in isolation for her to not know those things. She was spending time with her best friend next door who I'm sure would have shown her all the gadgets and how they worked. But all in all a powerful story which had me worried if I'm going to like the ending but I loved how the author addressed the whole issue.
B007TXN4TK|1.0|I tried to download on my daughter's tablet but it would not work. The fault is in the tablet not Amazon.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Well this app was one of my favorites until this awful update came and messed up the hole game. -.-&quot;!!! So I don't think you should buy the app till they fix the update. I hope this review helped anyway that wanted to have more info on the game<br />  &asymp;SpottedStar
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Great soundtrack but the movie sucks. Too much of a musical for me to watch more than the first 20 minutes of.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Awesome. Incredible acting. Well written. Not for the kids!!! We watched 3 seasons in the week we had off over the holidays.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|If you liked the other two MIB you will most likely enjoy this one also.  As always the special effects are great but, fortunately, do not completely overshadow the storyline as is too often the case in so many of this type of film.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Just got this game tonight. It has many levels and she really enjoys it. 99 cents is a bargain. It teaches problem solving.
B004R2DS9C|5.0|I purchased this for my grandson who has dozens of Lego sets.  Since he has so many storage has become a problem.  I thought this would be a great way to keep some of them separate while containing some of the mess.<br /><br />Once the box is unzipped to create the playmat there is a very nice design to create and build your structures.  Even the interior of the lid is printed with additonal scenery which you can then add to the edge of the mat to create a 3-dimensional set.<br /><br />The material is a bit padded so am hoping that will not interfer with his building.  Legos are pretty sturdy though so perhaps this won't be a problem.  He has not been using the toybox long enough for me to comment on the  durability but the case seems to be fairly well made and very cleverly designed.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Why did I waste my time,  unfortunately I am the type of reader that does not want to give up on a book, always believing it will get better.  This did not get better.
1400067820|5.0|I can not imagine not knowing this information. you are really gifted person. I hope they teach this in school. It is a book that must be read.<br />PLEASE read it for your own good.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|First off I'd like to say that I like Colin Farrell, though if he's in a movie it tends to bomb. That said I was actually surprised how good Total Recall was. of course Im a fan of the original and hate that Hollywood cant come up with something new, instead just remakes old films lately. But it was good I might even watch it a second time, which with most movies, that does not happen. It stuck with original themes also having its own flare. Colin didnt destroy it, he might even made the film.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|My mother was so psyched when she got this and popped it into the dvd player the moment she opened it.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Love this Christmas comedy. Sure to make you laugh.  Bought this for both of my girls to start their own family memories.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Truly disturbing, yet I watch every week. I am always shocked by the events and amazed by the fact that this is produced by the same writer as Glee.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I stayed up all night and read this all the way through. Interesting story and as always, I enjoyed the character Bosch.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are extremely talented! My whole family loves to listen to them. I bought friends and family their new CD for Christmas. I highly recommend their music to everyone, old and young alike.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I loved early Scarpetta novels. Some later ones were not my favorite, but I really enjoyed Bone Bed. Very happy this Scarpetta was worth the read.
0307352145|4.0|Seems ideal for introverts to check out. I am a classic extrovert and it's helped me widen my perspective. It has decent content and some good research. However 4 stars because it reads quite biased, and seems to be generalizing extroverts.
0765325950|5.0|I can't believe the lengths some people will go to be unproductive. Some would rather borrow the book, or obtain it illegally before buying the printed version?<br /><br />I too own a Kindle. I am so looking forward to buying the last hard back book to complete my collection!!!
B00ARAO1LC|2.0|poor should be a porno movie what else can i say it was lousey. matthew mcconaughey should buy the movie before any else can see it.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Throughout the movie, I felt Channing Tatum was sort of upstaged by Mathew McCon....  but the Mike character actually had a nice story arc and some growth.  The dancing was actually very poorly filmed.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I've been playing draw something on my iPhone for several months and love it. I was excited when I got the kindle to have a bigger drawing surface. To my disappointment, I discovered the kindle app doesn't have the same features as the iPhone app. On the iPhone app, if you don't want to draw one of the three words you are given to choose from, you can choose a different category. These categories, each with six or eight new words to choose from, cost one or more bombs. These words are worth five to nine coins to your opponent if he or she guesses your drawing. On the kindle app, it only gives you the option to get new words. This costs one of your bombs, and only gives you three new words, worth one, two, and three coins. Also, on the kindle app, you can't see your opponent's profile picture, when the last move was made, or the number of coins or bombs you have on the main screen; you don't have the opportunity to earn badges; and you can't see the number of bombs you have in the drawing screen (which is helpful when deciding whether to use a bomb to remove letters). I would rather play on the small screen of my iPhone.
B007V65R54|4.0|Really loved the real-world examples of applying statistics and the common human pitfalls.  Well written and easy to read.  Bogged down toward the end a little.
B00051E906|5.0|Great product.<br />Really easy to use and portable.<br />I bought two so that I can give one to a family member in Korea to detect any radiation tainted stuff coming in from Japan.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I'm not a big comic book/superhero/batman fan, but I like a good action story and this one was done very well.  I think it had a little less &#34;camp&#34; than some of the superhero films.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Excellent story for the whole family. My kids and baby girl enjoy to watch this over and over.<br />Also the video quality and audio quality are good
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|it kept me entertained and me on my toes trying in every level to get three stars give it a try but be warned it is addictive.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|never ever replace the cooling fins without cleaning off the old thermal paste and applying a new layer. carefull about how thick<br />you apply it too.
0545265355|5.0|Bought this set for a great price. These are nice quality hard covered books. Once you get reading these books, they are hard to put down because they are so good!
1451648537|5.0|It is very long but you will feel like you really know Steve when you are done.  He was such a jerk but an amazing mind.  I really enjoyed it and even got one for my son who is in the computer industry so I know he will enjoy the more technical details in the book.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|This movie is pretty laugh-out-loud funny. Fat Amy is the comic relief here but she isn't in the film as much as some of the other boring main stars. The opening gag will shock you but it's absolutely hilarious! My girlfriend and I enjoyed it via a 48 hour Amazon rental from the Wii U.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I am a few chapters in and I am already in love!  Preston and Child hit another home run with this Pendergast novel.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed this miles more than the first book. There is a lot more suspense and character development. Patiently awaiting the film.
B009O2XY12|1.0|This game will not download on my Kindle Fire HD.  I have tired several times and have finally given up and will be removing it from the device.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|And majorly disappointed. Admittedly, I saw the movie first which was not very good either. The last chapter picks up a bit though.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and once you get started you can't put it down.  I just wish it was easier to get more helps, you use your first ones up while learning how to play the game.
B006MPKAOI|5.0|I could not stop reading this book!<br />Cathy is a typical out of control 24 year old who meets Mr Perfect and thinks life is bliss...until the real Lee emerges and she finds herself trapped in a domestic violence cycle. Typical of all abusive men, he turns everyone against her and controls her life so tightly she finds herself alone and helpless and fighting sanity.<br />The story jumps between 2008 Cathy and 2004 Catherine and the differences between the same person are vast. 2008 Cathy has escaped her manic boyfriend but is still living a life controlled by him and her OCD and PTSD are described in great detail. The book did keep me gripped and like others in the book I also found myself questioning Cathy at times.<br />My only negative is that I found that I paid little attention to the months of each chapter and so in turn I questioned how quickly some things seemed to derail or improve and whilst I love neat endings, I felt like after the intense detail for the first 300 pages, the last 100 came across a little rushed.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|Thus album is the truth, tip is back and hotter then ever. Cop this album asap you will not regret buying it.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This book kept coming up on my recommended list and so I finally gave it a go...I was hooked from start to finish. I thought I had it all figured out about a quarter of the way through the book and then it completely threw me.<br />All of the characters are completely unlikeable but you become addicted to them nevertheless.<br />A well thought out book - perhaps unrealistic in many senses but it keeps you turning the pages.<br />The ending was a let down for me, but when I really thought about it I did not want either of them to end up happy so it was apt in some ways.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a book the caught my fairy tale imagination side of me. I hoped it had a better ending. But loved the romantic, realistic fairy tale that lost me for a couple hours.
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|For a first novel - this is pure perfection.<br />I loved Victoria with all of her flaws and quirks; a ward of the state and moved from home to home for the first 9 years of her life, abandoned by her parents and feeling like she will never belong anywhere, Victoria is someone you will love and hate all at once. She hates to be touched, barely speaks and is agressive and hostile, but underneath it all is a little girl aching to be loved and mothered.<br />The book jumps between Victoria aged 18 and free from the state and Victoria aged 9 when her life changes forever. It delves into the self destructive nature of anyone who has been hurt/abused as a child and looks at how hard it is to trust and let your guard down even when you really want to.<br />I loved so many elements of this book; I loved the realness of the emotions and the magical quality that the flowers and their hidden meanings bring to the story, I loved the awkward and honest relationships between everyone, the imperfection of family dynamic and the strength and need for forgiveness on so many levels. I loved that where there is success there is also failure and the way Victoria's foray into becoming a mother is handled swept me away and I felt her raw emotion.<br />This story looks closely at the mother/daughter relationship and how some people throw it away, some people fight their whole lives to have it, some people take it for granted and others do not know how to cope with it.<br />The book comes with flower meanings at the end which I also found fascinating. I would recomend this book to anyone.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was an amazing book. I can't wait for the forth one.<br /><br />Everyone should buy it like right now! Enjoy!!!!
B0066NA8CU|5.0|This is one of the best TV shows in a long time! The scripts are very intelligently written, there are sub-plots in each episode, & they are never boring. The show is tightly-edited, the acting is well done, & you do get involved with & care about the characters. I highly recommend this show!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Colllons did a remarkable job with The Hunger Games! Even though I had seen the movie, every word of the book captivated me and made me want to keep reading!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This was a good movie, I really liked the way it played out in the end. The only thing I did not like was that it kept saying that we lost the internet connection and we had to start it again several times, this is the first movie I have ordered from amazon, I hope they aren't all that way.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It's the best normally I dnt even wake up on time but thnks to my alarm clock free I get up right on time it's an amazing app especially for a sleepy head like me
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Really great movie considering it is a third in the series! Josh Brolin does a great &#34;K.&#34; Also had a little bit of heart warming content and of course humor and action!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is one of my all time favorites. It tells you so much about the feeling of being in love but is not cheesy like most love story's. It also is about cancer but yet again John green does not make this book fell like a cancer novel. Another one of my favorite books is anna and the french kiss. I recommend that book very much of you liked this book.
B008YU0AOE|1.0|tan(4 degrees) = some 16 digit decimal<br /><br />Now try...<br />tan(1.6 degrees) = the same 16 digit decimal...why bother displaying the answer down to so many digits when it's wrong?<br /><br />tan(1.5 or less) results in zero...wrong again<br /><br />Sure, doing trig functions for such small angles isn't that common, unless it's for performing alignment calcs (wheel/suspension alignments) in which case ALL angles are small angles....this app is useless for anything but what you can already do in your head.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love the book love the movie love The Hunger Games I personally love Katniss  and Peeta I love the drama and suspense and I'm only10 years old love \\"The Hunger Games\\" and Susanne Collins. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My grand daughter has enjoyed playing this game and it is designed for her age group.<br />I would recommend to other customers.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I really loved this book! It is sort of a long read, but very enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone who is literate.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My nine year old grand daughter loves it.<br />I would recommend to other customers.<br />thank you for having games for younger children.
030758836X|4.0|Book begins and seems ordinary and predictable, and then the twists begin.  Lots of twists and turns, and heavy intellectual plotting.  Not what I expected at all, which was a refreshing change.  Disliked the ending.  Very abrupt, but leaves room for a second novel.  If you enjoy thinking games, suspense, and plots, you should enjoy this.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was the first of Gillian's books that I read. I really enjoyed her writing style and it was hard for me to stop reading. I have since read &#34;Gone Girl,&#34; and am very much looking forward to reading &#34;Dark Places,&#34; which is next on my list of must-reads.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I ordered this DVD for my husband and we LOVE it! We recommend it! Wish we saw it on the big screen!
B009Z5BPZK|4.0|I'm still sad Gossip Girl ended. Six seasons that seemed to be like three, and this sixth and final season doesn't dissapoint. New faces, new mysteries and of course the most important secret is revealed! (GG's identity).<br />I just wish it could have lasted longer, at least thirteen episodes; ten episodes are not enough for a final season of any show, and I feel like the writers rushed everything up by the final three or two episodes.<br />Anyway, this season has the most shocking moments and twists (Dan's revenge from the UES society, Serena's sudden change of attitude, and Blair and Chuck finally trying to have their happy ending, and Nate... well, dating Sage).<br /><br />If you're a fan of the show, you have to buy this to complete your collection. Gossip Girl may have ended, but hey, at least we have the DVD's!
B008OIQYTG|5.0|If you are a fan of Lee Ritenour, this music will not disappoint.  He is an absolute master of the guitar and I enjoy listening to him live or recorded.  Can't wait for him to come back to NYC!
0316098329|4.0|This was an excellent book, although I could not call it really enjoyable.<br /><br />The depiction of the circumstances from the viewpoint of a five yeard old boy in an 11x11 room took a little gettingf used to, but was well worth the effort.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|This movie doesn't require a great deal of thought or introspection, which is exactly why it's a real thrill ride.  If you are looking for an historical drama that speaks to the life of Abe Lincoln, this may not be the movie for you.  On the other hand if you're just looking for a rather intelligent vampire flick, with fine acting, great scenics, lots of blood, some humor and terrific sound track I recommend this movie.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|chess is a fun  to play and I like to play it on the go now on my kindle fire
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This was the first game of this type that I have played and I enjoyed it a lot.  Looking forward to trying some the other Big Fish mysteries.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Love Blind Side. I have watched more times then anyone can imagine. I always cry when I do.  Love the cast especially since I<br /><br />am a big fan of Tim McGraw.  I live in Baltimore and am a Raven fan.  Michael Ore is great.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I will admit that I started reading the Lee Child series because of hearing about the new Tom Cruise movie (Jack Reacher), and I was bummed to find out that the first book I read was not the first book in the series (though it was the book on which the movie was based). This is actually the introduction of Jack Reacher. He is a terrific character, and I am looking forward to going through the whole series. The movie was fun, but not fantastic, but the books are great fun, easy reads, and quite compelling. If you like a lead man like Jason Bourne or Jack Clark, you will like Jack Reacher.
B008IGP8QE|4.0|My son wanted this for Christmas, he has played the heck out of it. To the point that we are having problems getting it to play so I'm looking into getting him a new copy.
B005NKIQ26|4.0|I am happy with this CD and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys Christmas and likes Justin Bieber's sound.
B006MPKDD6|5.0|If you love the character of Harry Bosch then you will love this book. Michael Connelly's book are always good but this is one of the best.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I played through this game in about 4 days and I just never wanted to stop playing it because I had to figure out what was going on and even after I finished the game getting four of the six endings I felt like I had to go play for the other two endings.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|The only problem i had with this book was that it kind of dragged and jumped all over the place, but other than that a pretty good read.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Loved the acting, loved the storyline...but, kinda boring. I kept thinking I would see more action like you'd see in a 'Bourne' movie. Not the case. Also, I love Levitt-but his make-up looked really fake. Sadly disappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Not as good as the first but I couldn't put it down. I must admit I can't wait to start book three.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this series!  Actually, I have read and re-read them 3 times already!  I think when the movies are made that either Ian Sommerhalter or Mark Walberg should play Christian! Mmmmm, Sexy, sexy
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|These guys really put together a great album in Sigh No More. I saw Mumford & Sons on Austin City Limits and couldn't believe the quality of their production. This album's lyrics are thought provoking and the music is spirit borne.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|And the plot thickens!!!!!  Christian and Ana, I just can't get enough! Emotionally touching and absolutely HOT, HOT, HOT.  Can't wait to finish &#34;Freed&#34;
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|based on.the.previews I thought this movie would be funny but it ends up that the best part was the previews. if I were you id wait until its on redbox or a venue that charges less than a dollar for it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ok, I admit..I thought it was going to be nothing but sex, the story line hooked me and the hot, steamy, sexy scences were just a plus!
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law get 5 stars for reprising the rolls of Holmes and Watson.  Their onscreen chemistry was funny, entertaining, and, as much as two guys can be, poignant.  The storyline was interesting, the action well done and I loved the way they took an old classic and brought it to a new century.  Well done!
B005NQ5LQ4|3.0|there is lots of great action on this dvd but the story compared to the first two is a little off base not to mention the continuity is messed up.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Matt Damon does an excellent job narrating this documentary.  Mr. Ferguson did a great job exposing the details  that contributed to the 2008 Great Recession. If this doesn't get you ticked off, I can't imagine what will.
1401233791|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this story as it was the first time for me to learn about the full story of bane and why he went after the batman. the art is decent but the story is what drives this book. I particularly liked the inclusion of the bane origin.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Gave this as Christmas gifts and everyone was pleased, esp. the older kids in the family.  It's difficult and challenging enough to keep them working at it for long periods of time.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I have read a couple other of the author's book and really enjoy his style. Very under-rated artist. This book was very easy to read and had a very interesting, well detailed and well described scenery, and the story was well built as it went along. The crescendo at the end was very exciting and then when it was all over it was a very unexpected ending. Really enjoyed it.
1455502758|5.0|In this little book, Hitchens caps his life and career by writing honestly about what death means to him as an atheist, without the consoling promise of misplaced hope.  As the first thing I read from Hitchens, I find myself regretting not &#34;getting to know&#34; him while he was alive.  A powerful read, inviting and not argumentative - a great way for anyone to understand--believer and nonbeliever alike--how an atheist can deal with mortality.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really thought this was a well crafted, well written story. My only complaint is there wasn't enough in the way of explantion but then after I read this the next book-a prequel-came out. Have not read it yet but looking forward to finding out more about these crazy silos. The title of the book is clever, the whole story is very well told and I really can't say enough about it. So I'll stop before I start to ramble...just get the book. Easier to buy it all in this omnibus edition because if you read one you'll want to read the rest.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This was a great rental. I love streaming on Amazon and it was totally worth it for this particular title. I would recommend it.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Rocky movies are great! You can not go wrong with this purchase. It is easily an American classic movie collection.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Very good game. So addictive and many levels to complete. I wish this was on regular computer on facebook.  I cant stop playing; it so much fun.
B008VZFK7O|4.0|Amazingly brutal and beautifully sadistic. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a darkly crafted revenge thriller.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Came in time for Christmas. My son is addicted to Buzz and can't get enough of this movie....so much that I had to order the next 2 for him. Thank you!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love the graphics and the plot... yes this movie has a good funny plot.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes watching quality films with a good message.<br /><br />Light bulb.....
B00973902K|5.0|Yep that was one from the Summer of 2012. It's a fun song and it was super cheap on Amazon one day. Impulse buy...
B00110K62U|1.0|Wore out my original purchase.  One version I had was out of style and I could not use it on current players..
B003FHMHPQ|5.0|I liked it a lot.<br />I bought it by mistake and when i finish reading it I was very happy
B0053O89WY|1.0|I bought this DVD set for my sister for Christmas. I love this show, so my rating is not to reflect my opinion of the show, but of the fact that Amazon needs to stop selling pirated DVDs. This is without a doubt a pirated copy. This is not the first time I have received a pirated DVD from Amazon, but it will be my last. I will no longer be purchasing DVDs from them.
B000H1RFKU|5.0|An excellent film starring Denzel Washington,Ethan Hawke,Scott Glenn,Tom Beringer(Platoon) and other great actors. I learned more about the true existance of the &#34;Russian Mafia&#34; in the USA and their involvement in the drug trade.Highly recommend...
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Ok boys and girls lets settle down and give this album a fair assessment. There are two reasons many are reacting in the negative. First, there are those including myself who find the photos of Diana too much. But if you look at previous album covers she has always been \\"sexy\\". This time she used bad judgement and went over the top, no pun intended. This is forgivable, so lets get to the music. Many fans of Diana simply did not like their image of her altered. They want to keep her locked into a jazz pianist/vocalist mode. Speaking for myself and others who did give this album an honest listen, T-Bone did a fine job producing and Diana did a fine job singing a good selection of songs, albeit in a style that rumpled the feathers of some fans. I am very happy I have this cd and I know I will listen to it frequently.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This is Mr.Steven Spielberg's movie &#34;that had to be made&#34;,to show the whole entire world,the true atrocities of &#34;The Holocaust&#34; Well directed,music by John Williams is superb,as usual,and the acting is beyond words! If anyone can walk away from this film and not be in &#34;shock&#34; @ the horror that the Nazi's did to these Jewish people,then they can't be human...
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Another free product that wastes a few minutes time when you have it. It is free so rate it excellent.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Ben Affleck's second film that he produced...good/unique and interesting movie. Good job Ben!I highly recommend this film to any Ben Affleck fan...
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I was playing angry birds and saw the app for Star Wars Angry Birds. I downloaded it and now it's the one I play all the time. There are a few scenes higher up that seem impossible to conquer but it sure is fun to play. The game does hang up at times but it's not a really big problem. love the game and it's free to download.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|Does anyone know the name of the song playing in he background of the demo video? How would I get whole of the person/company who made this app &amp; video?
B004Q3RDVG|5.0|There isn't a whole lot I can say about this book series than what has aleady been said.  In my opinion, the entire serious was extremely well-written... it captivated me to never want to put it down, as well as wish there had been a 4th book in the series.
0525457585|4.0|This was a great product! My sister was overjoyed to receive it as her Christmas gift! A perfect read for her long flight to Paris two days later!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|V E R Y M O V . I  N G I RECOMMEND to people who can sit down and pay attention to a book
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Actually watched this with a good frend on a at home movie night. 16 years old and I know every song.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|An unusual buddy film,  Funny Ideas expressed by a stuffed bear.  Wahlberg plays it just right.  He believes and so do we.  The VFX technique is seamless.  At moments the gross dialog and actions goes a bit too far for my taste, but  on balance it does explore some funny ideas and situations in a unique way.  I laughed out loud quite a few times  Watch it.
B00139XSBA|5.0|Reading this book for my son's academic decathalon, I was reminded how fresh and bright Tom Wolfe's reporting was compared to everyone else, then or now.  Even you care little about the space program or its premises, this is a story of misplaced men in a misplaced time that comes to life on the page through the unique lens of Tom Wolfe.  Wolfe benefits significantly, I think, from remaining grounded in the reality of the men of historical legend as opposed to the Booleanh drift that seems to take occur with his fiction
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Teasers where very interesting and provocative.  I'm not good at appointment viewing so I will wait to watch when its available on Amazon.
0765325950|1.0|I have neither the space for real books in my 5'x8' bunk in Afghanistan, nor the inclination to wait 3+ weeks for APO delivery.  If you'd wanted my money, you should have released the eBook on day one.  Now I will just borrow it from the base library or get a bootlegged digital copy from an Afghan shopkeeper.  Congratulations on alienating a decades-long fan (of WoT & Tor) and ensuring you never see a single dime of my money ever again.<br /><br />To Mr. Sanderson: Don't let Tor do this to you again.  You deserve better!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Some a bit different from Grisham, but nice to see he can still grab my interest in his tall tale.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really love this app. I hope that they make more floors to play on. I also hope that they make more games like this.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|If you liked John Cory in DeMille's other books, you will love this one.  His comments are so funny.  The sarcasm overrides the seriousness of the story, and makes it a delight to read.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|What isn't there to like about historical fiction?  I enjoyed the story lines through which Follett provided the human perspective of historical facts.  He effectively describes scenes, character reactions and interactions to enable the reader to imagine integral facets of the story.
B004QX07G4|5.0|In need of a good laugh read this book, you can't remain sad while reading this, go ahead I dare you.<br />I love Ellen the book was as good as her show.<br />Thank you Ellen for making me laugh over and over!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|overall great for using it just for the time but if you want to change the way the time image is, buy the add free version
0765367297|5.0|bought as a gift for my nephew who loves halo. he started reading it immediately and loves it. he says he wants the others as well now.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|good movie. ending leads into original of alien movie. would definitely recommend this movie to others interested in a good sci fi movie
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love books that keep you reading the whole time, and this book never had any boring parts, it keeps you on the edge of your seat through the whole thing. I can't wait to read the next one!

0547884591|3.0|In this book, Tim Ferriss seeks to deconstruct cooking into its most basic skills and teach you those skills by stepping through a series of simple recipes.<br /><br />In teaching, Tim has the advantage of being a beginner himself, so he has detailed instruction on beginner skills.  Everything from kitchen gear to knife skills to cooking eggs.  As a 20-something bachelor, this is great, but some parts are a little too basic, even for me.  Tim also includes a section on basic flavor combinations which I thought was pretty helpful in beginning to understand spice combinations.<br /><br />Tim's advantage in teaching, however, becomes a disadvantage for the final recipe selections.  Tim created a series of basic recipes based on much more complicated recipes.  This sounds great in theory, but the final dishes end up extremely bland.  For standard American dishes, this would be fine.  Bland eggs are still awesome if they're cooked well.  Plain steak with a little salt can taste fantastic.  Bland lamb shanks?  That's a weird taste without the correct seasonings, and the 4-hour-chef seasonings were 1 green onion, salt, and pepper for 2.5 lbs of meat cooked in half a bottle of wine...  I, for one, would have appreciated the full recipes next to the basic recipes.  I am all for trying new foods, but please give me the full flavored version!<br /><br />I have just been skipping around trying some of the different recipes.  Obviously this makes the step-by-step skill development a little useless, but some of the recipes are worth trying out.<br /><br />Also seems like a lot of recipes were ripped out of Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Cookery Course...<br /><br />To sum up: decent focus on basic skills but bland recipes.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|Enjoyed this book very much. I was kept in suspence to the end. Always 'Micheal Connelly novels. Have read them all
B0053TMP24|5.0|I always loved the Percy Jackson series, and love the heroes of Olympus even better! What I love about it is the action and thrill, combined with romance. I recommend this book to people who love mythology and a great fictional story. You could be a girl or boy and still love it!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This is a great series of books.  I am planning on reading the entire series.  Just purchased the second and can't wait to start reading.
B008476HBM|5.0|I wished  I had read this novel in high school. I have been missing out!a terrific,classic read that I recommend to all.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Uplifting, and funny. Well worth every penny and every minute spent reading it. Could literally hear Ellen's voice on every page. I loved this book.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is probably my second favorite game on android. It starts easy but gets very hard and complex. Almost endless hours of puzzles.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I'm a huge fan of diary of a simply kid an I hope the next book is even better. This is the best book I've read in a while.
B0032TORKA|5.0|I love this book series and I can't wait for the author to realease his next book related to this universe. I think these books are a must read.
B008RJFRTK|3.0|Offline maps are real good, the app works fine but it's too hard (at least for me) to do simple things like directions... unusually bad usability. 3 stars at best
B00AESN8XY|3.0|This game is fun and hard but I still cannot beat it. I'm not sure if it has that much play-ability its very repetitive.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Does what it promises to do - entertains. We had lots of fun watching this movie. The lines are witty, the acting is good (tongue-in-the-cheek good), special effects are awesome. A good relaxing watching experience. Go for it !
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Its angry birds which is a great game and its in space... Just think about it, it has to be great. But seriously, its the same old stuff. Is it worth it for free, yes? I wouldn't pay for it.
B007AR7OGE|4.0|I have not heard all of this set yet.  I have the box Verve box set too and it is really great.  The Verve Songbook Box has lots of the same material as included in this box set.<br /><br />The point of my writing this review is that all the prior reviews of this set are really from earlier issues of Ella's music.  None of the reviews are of this set.  All of the other reviews are dated before this set actually was released.<br /><br />More later.
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this because it is like a top rated game. It is very addicted and fun. It looks amazing on my kindle fire. I would get it just to waste time.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Great story line and movie.  The bear attack/fighting scene is a bit much for a young child.  As with all new movies, I wish you could skip over all the previews, make them an option on the menu.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Arrived quickly at holiday time. Nice gift for teenager. Boxed set was watched over vacation. We would recommend this purchase.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|What can I say. This book takes everything good from literature, films, and video games, tosses them in a blender and creates a perfect read.  Achievement unlocked Mr. Cline.
0316228532|1.0|THIS IS THE WORST NOVEL THAT I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!Being a fan of Harry Potter, I really had high hopes for this book, considering it's written by JK Rowling. Well......it just wasn't Harry Potter. I understand that she probably wanted to write something different than fantasy. 100 pages in, I just couldn't find much that was redeemable about it, and quit reading.  There was barely any story line. All I could gather was that a man named Barry Fairbrother had died, leaving a seat empty on the Parish Council.  There were a few lines of description that this man was trying to do some positive work to help the people who lived in the Fields, but that was it. Was this supposed to be the story? I don't know, there was too much vulgarity hiding it if it was. If JK Rowling had actually concentrated on writing about the work he had done for the Fields people, and the gap that he left behind in improving that community when he died, this would have actually been a great story. But......NO! Instead she had to spend pages and pages writing DISTURBING and VERY graphic sex scenes, using the F word as many times as possible, and as many scenes as possible involving drug usage.  This was just gross. If she was an unknown author, it wouldn't have bothered me so much, but........she's JK Rowling. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF WRITING MUCH BETTER THAN THIS! SHE SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED TO HAVE HER NAME ON THE COVER OF THIS BOOK!!!! I know that I  won't buy any more of her books in the future.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I found the layout of the game on the screen to be a little tight, but the game is very exciting and I am winning often
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The Panther is one strong reason that DeMille remains one of my very favorite story tellers. The level of research that goes into a DeMille novel is mind boggling! The book scares me to an unbelievable level. I'm afraid that there is much to be feared in this novel. All of his characters are believable and his plots are complex enough to keep you guessing, even though you kinda know where it is going. The dénouement is complete even though a window is left open for a follow on. As always I highly reccomend The Panther.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This novel do not produce the interesting characters that most of his books produce.  The plot was interesting  but seemed as though the storyline was not cohesive it gave me the feeling that it was developed in a piece meal fashion.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I enjoyed The Racketeer but felt that too many word were wasted on unnecessary narative. The book didn't require any research and as such was pretty hollow. Grisham is a great story teller though and he does make thiis book a page turner.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Easy to access and seems to have a wide range of venues though I could not find many hoped for stations
B004P8JPS6|4.0|As usual this book meets the &#34;Child&#34; standard. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes; action, complex plots, clean denouement and a quasi believable main character.
0547884591|5.0|Have had it for two weeks now, On lesson two in domestic, and working through the meta learing section. So much information in this text, I cant wait to get through it all!!!
0307887960|5.0|I actually got this book from the library at first, and I was reading it just to see what types of diet and nutrition plans are currently out there.  I had about 20 lbs to lose, but wasn't really mentally ready to do it yet.  He fascinated me with how he approaches this from a psychological point - \\"I'll give you quick results to win you over, and then we'll slow down and finish out right\\" type attitude.  He also addressed every issue and concern I've heard presented with a high protein diet.  I became so intriqued that I decided to try it just to see if it was real or all hype.  This plan works shocking well, if you follow it exactly of course.  I very quickly lost the first 10 lbs, took a break when I needed to as he suggested, and am now within 2 lbs of my goal.  It wasn't just about the change on the scale.  I saw my thighs and stomach slim down very rapidly, and the confidence and motivation boost that gave me was amazing.  I ended up buying the book, and now it is a resource I refer to frequently.  It is not intended to be a long term plan, and the author knows that.  It is a four step process, with maintenance being the last (and very easy to follow) phase.  I highly recommend this book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|daughter loves my little pony and she loves the game. we have been waiting to kindle to have a mop app!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Lots of choices and mixes.  Love the sleep timer i use it every night.<br />My kindle is on the bedside table so works great.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Has all of their hits. Sound and picture quality was excellent. Was best concert dvd they ever made. Would buy again.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Excellent show. This show keeps your interest in its entirety! The amount of fearful entities involve make it more enticing. Tune in to become addicted.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|The Deftones. If you don't know, you better know. These guys do not disappoint! Album after album and they only get better, even the various side projects that the members are in are awesome. Koi No Yokan is true Deftones, the thrash, the softness, the musical ability and the lyrics are all true to form. I have never been let down by these guys.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|I wish that the UK version of this musical had been filmed, rather than the Australian one. I have owned the original soundtrack since 2010, and don't like how the songs were changed for this version. I had purchased this with excitement, and from the moment it started, I was filled with disappointment.<br /><br />The soundtrack moves me almost immediately when I start listening to it, it draws me in quickly and keeps me entranced for the entire 2:20; this version skips any and all setup that the soundtrack has, and jumps straight into storyline, which is cut down to 2:01. Entire sections are completely different, conversations had have different characters having them.. it doesn't flow nearly as well as the original version.<br /><br />If you get the chance and the time to listen to it, listen to the UK soundtrack, especially if you feel as though this show isn't up to par. It could change your mind.
B0089AF2DS|5.0|I heard &#34;Take My bones Away&#34; on a cable music channel and the hunt was on! I got the album and could not stop listening to it.<br />It's filled with soft melodic moments that lull you into a peaceful place and then there are the songs that kick you in the ass and make you want to get up and do something...anything!!! 100% recommend this album.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Couldn't wait to see it but even though it was different than I expected, but it was still ok to watch once.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I spend a lot of time on Facebook and this works great.. Just a tap and you are there.. I would recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a big fan of Orson Scott Card's Ender series.  Otherwise, I don't do this particular genre too much.  These books are positively addicting.  I got the omnibus edition, finished in less than one week, then immediately purchased the two Silo books and finished them both in one day each.  Very engaging characters and storyline, must read!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I couldn't stop playing this one..it was fun and challenging.. beware that it gets harder and harder...give it a try..
B00006GEB4|1.0|Still have not received the vinyl and its been 3 weeks. im sure this will change as soon as it arrives.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Being a Bruno Mars fan, all I can say is that I love this album.. Don't hesitate..listen to the songs and get it...
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The app is okay. Nothing to write home about. It needs some improvements. It does serve its purpose but slowwwly.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Wanted to see this movie and when I received my free month of Prime, I knew it was time to watch it.. It was great..
B007X4ECLY|4.0|Was not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised with acting from Guy Pearce. production value is cheaper, especially the beginning, but overall a decent action flick.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fantastic book! Captured my interest from page 1!  Such a great story line with many twists along the way :)
B003ZSJ212|3.0|One should spend little time reading this - & move on to other reviews --- This set IS NOT &#34;Definitive&#34; --- One may consider the audio?
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Other reviewers have said it better than I can. I read book 4 in the series despite the lukewarm reviews, but this will be the last. After reading this book and reading the reviews on book 5, it seems that after book 3, each book is getting progressively uninspired. I'm not normally one to abandon a series once I'm hooked, but after reading the book 5 reviews and seeing the $14.99 Kindle price for book 5.... I'm done with this series. The first 3 books were good for the genre, but far from great literature.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I had this album in my cart the second Amazon had it eligible for preorder. It stayed in my cd player in my car for over a month (yes I still buy and play CDs). If you liked their first album you'll love this one, if you've only ever heard a few songs, liked them and are reading these reviews wondering if its worth buying the whole album then stop reading and just buy it already, because it is.
B00992CF6W|5.0|All you got to do is pay 7$ for an awesome game! Join your friends. Make awesome worlds like I did it is totally worth it. Milt cousins harlted it but I showed them what you can do. They bought it and play it a lot! Buy it!
B007MU85D0|5.0|I bought this album for 'Little Talks ' and knew I'd like the rest of it since its the kind of music I love. I'll be honest I first heard the song on the radio which made me look up more songs, so I'm not a longtime fan but I will be now. Unique songs with beautiful lyrics and fun music. Love the male/female duet, not too many bands out there where they sing most of their songs like that, both equally singing their own parts and together at the same time. Now hopefully the radio doesn't overplay them ; )
1612680011|5.0|This book honestly in a must read for anyone looking to gain financial knowledge.  I'm not the type of person who likes to just sit down and read books but I found myself not wanting to stop reading.  Robert Kiyosaki lays out keys to financial success in a way that makes them very easy to understand.  I enjoyed the book so much that in the two weeks since finishing Rich Dad, Poor Dad I have read two more of his books.
B008J34466|4.0|This isn't Pinks best cd no but its definitely not her worst. Some songs are good some eh. Still think Funhouse is my favorite, where I loved pretty much every song on it. But glad to see Pink's finally getting the credit she deserves as an artist.
B0091REZMW|5.0|And it is enjoyable to play even if you aren't paying real money. Been playing a week now and still there is so much to do. Definitely extensive as far as the number of quests.
B0077ATSSQ|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, especially the young actor, Tom Horn, who is in nearly every scene in the movie.<br />It reminded me a little of the TV Show, &#34;Touch&#34;, were you feel involved in the action, even though you don't expect it all to be very plauseable.  I would expect that parents of children in the age group of 9 - 12, would be telling their friends about this movie.  It is a quiet type movie that I hope more people buy or rent.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|M Y F A V O R I T E M O V I E AND ITS PRETTY CHEAP AND WORKS WONDERFULLY
0525478817|4.0|John Green almost accomplishes the impossible, writing a book about life - as opposed to death - from the perspective of a teenage terminal cancer patient who's surrounded by other disease-ridden youth. The first half of the book showcases creative and unparalleled writing. As just one example of the brilliant literary vehicle Green creates at cruising speed, I offer: \\"His hand reached for her boob over her shirt and pawed at it, his palm still while his fingers moved around. I wondered if that felt good. Didn't seem like it would, but I decided to forgive Isaac on the grounds that he was going blind. The senses must feast while there is yet hunger and whatever.\\" The placement of that \\"and whatever\\" just kills me. Perfection. Green's other massive accomplishment is enabling the reader to empathize with minor characters (always a difficult feat) via the observations of a sixteen year-old (teenagers being renowned for their egocentricity and all). Case in two points: (1) \\"[W]hen I was in the ICU and it looked like I was going to die and Mom was telling me it was okay to let go, and I was trying to let go but my lungs kept searching for air, Mom sobbed something into Dad's chest that I wish I hadn't heard, and that I hope she never finds out that I did hear. She said, `I won't be a mom anymore'\\"; (2) \\"[Dad] was waving back, and crying. It occurred to me that he was probably thinking he might never see me again, which he probably thought every single morning of his entire weekday life as he left for work, which probably sucked.\\" The only fault I find in Green's star turn is probably a matter of personal preference (I'm a sunshine and rainbows kind of girl): the second half of the book felt anticlimactic both emotionally (spoiler alert: the ratio of time the characters spend living versus dying flips) and literarily (even a vehicle like a Ferrari loses the wow factor if you ride in it long enough).

B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is gem for any puzzle game lover.  You drag balls of goo to form structures to help your little goo balls reach their destination.  The best part of the game is the art style.  It is refreshingly unique.
B008J34466|5.0|I am a huge Pink fan and have every album. When I first listened to this album I was worried and then I saw a special on VH-1 I think and she did some of the songs. I decided to give it another try and now I can't stop listening to it. Love every song on it. I should have known I would.
